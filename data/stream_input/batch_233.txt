B000002NZO|5.0|Trespass is one of the Genesis's best album, along with Foxtrot, Nursery, Selling and Lamb.<BR>In a way Trespass reaches the pureness of Genesis, there is what I consider one of the best progressive rock and  no prog rock album ever made. Beginning with Looking for someone, outstanding piece, deep meaning, sweet and hurting melodies, <BR> Stopping by Stagnation, which is an amazing song, great melodies, great words, there you can find  the unique atmosphere that only Genesis and few others can give,<BR>Stagnation is a masterpiece, listen at it deeply an you'll agree with me, a poem of music.<BR>The knife is the ultimate progressive and non progressive rock song, wonderful strong  melodies, screaming voices, an absolutely out of the ordinary Steve Hackett's guitar solo, you can listen at this album over and over for an entire life and never get sick of it.<BR>If I would be in a desert island and I would have the choice of having 10 albums to listen for the rest of my days I'd include Trespass with no doubts .<BR>I'm sorry for my English, I'm not a native and therefore not a perfect writer, hope you got the meaning though: Trespass: Music Masterpiece.
B00005U11Z|4.0|Journey and me go waaaay back. I have loved them from the beginning and followed their career. I regret I haven't seen them live so this was a dream come true for me. I must admit from the get go that I am partial to Steve Perry (I think most of us are, right?) and I do so wish he were singing.  However, his replacement, Steve Augeri, does a good job especially on the faster songs. This is a must own for all Journey fans because Neal Schon, Ross Vallory and Johnathan Cain show that time under a true artists belt, only makes them BETTER. Great sound, wonderful enthusiasm, fantastic entertaining show to watch and enjoy many times.<br />Soar,<br />Soaring Heart
B00005JKMQ|1.0|Although the preformances of Will Smith and the rest of the cast are nothing less then first rate, the very long story is choppy and hard to follow. When viewing the film it was assumed by the film makers that everyone watching already knew all the facts and event's in Ali's life thus the film would jump from one month to one much later, and even years later skipping over explanation for signifigant events. <BR>Anyone who know's Ali's life story already might find this much more appealing, however with out the background knowledge the film becomes hard to follow and rather confusing. With out this knowledge it becomes hard to even like this film at all. Even with actual effort put behind trying to like it.

0060931671|1.0|Thankfully brief, this surreal satire may have been fresh and irreverent some 35 years ago when it was first published, but today it reads as a hyperstylized game of literary three card monte. The book is ostensibly about a woman who has been made executor of a rich former lover's estate, and her attempt to unravel the meaning of an ambiguous set of clues left behind. What this allows is for Pynchon to whisk her into and out of a number of wacky hi-jinks and meetings with post-beatnik weirdoes in an attempt to satirize both humankind's quest for knowledge and meaning, and post 1950s America. This is accomplished with a prose style that is going to either delight or dismay most readers with it's silly wordplay (especially in character names) and grab-bag referencing of physics, Greek tragedies, postal history, drug culture, and much more. I personally found the language tiresome, grating, and insubstantial-like too many Hollywood blockbusters of today, Pynchon is so busy throwing carefully constructed pyrotechnics at the reader that he never provides anything to care about.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I never really liked comic books or even cartoons for that matter but I really loved spider-man. It was alot deeper than most action/super hero movies and Tobey Maguire did an amazing job! I think anyone, even if u havnt read ths comic, should go see this movie, its definatley worth the time
B00005JKED|1.0|The previews to this movie are extremely misleading, the film lacks a decent story and is basically a violent shoot em up bad cop flick! Denzel Washington is definately not meant to be the bad guy, although convincing in his portrayal, it somehow did not fit. Ethan Hawkes preformance was shoddy at best. <BR>I have not seen very many movies that are this bad, however I rented it for free and yet still feel as though I paid too much! <BR>If your into watching two straight hours of violence then this might be the flick for you, however if you are looking for a film with at least a bit of a story behind it, then you should definately look elsewhere because this is certianly not it!
B00003CY5J|4.0|In THE SCORE, Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, an expert thief who specializes in high-stakes robberies but keeps a low profile.  Marlon Brando, as Nick's long-time friend Max, lures Nick back into the game for one last score.  This time, there's an inside guy:  Edward Norton starring as Jack Teller.  Jack is a very intense guy, very capable and demanding.  Nick is coldly cautious, owns a jazz club and is entering into a serious relationship with what looks like the love of his life.  Max is also deep in debt to deadly bookies.  While Nick is ready, willing and able to step away from the caper, he can't quite do it while leaving his long-time friend to twist in the wind.  So Nick risks all, stepping into the lion's mouth with a young, hardheaded thief, putting love in the balance and sticking with the friendship.  Nick is also breaking one of his cardinal rules by stealing inside his own town.<br />With dozens of movies behind him, ranging from comedies such as MEET THE PARENTS and ANALYZE THIS to tense, gritty urban pieces like A BRONX TALE, HEAT, and CASINO, and action adventure movies like 15 MINUTES, RONIN, and MIDNIGHT RUN, Robert De Niro has developed a captivating stage presence that often transcends character and plot.  Marlon Brando needs no introduction after having starred in THE WILD ONE, ON THE WATERFRONT, ONE-EYED JACKS, and THE GODFATHER.  Edward Norton has made his chops in PRIMAL FEAR, FIGHT CLUB, and AMERICAN HISTORY X.  Frank Oz, the director, has been responsible for THE DARK CRYSTAL, DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, and WHAT ABOUT BOB?  Interestingly enough, Oz is also the voice of Miss Piggy of THE MUPPET SHOW and Yoda of STAR WARS fame.<br />The pacing of the movie was good and kept the viewer engaged with the various aspects of the heist.  Edward Nortan played a tough character that carried a dark edge with him constantly.  Robert De Niro came across naturally, as always--making him one of the favored multi-tasking actors such as Gene Hackman and Michael Caine that always deliver in whatever capacity they sign on for.  The actual robbery itself was done extremely well, moving all the various components of the plot constantly without letting go a single tense angle.<br />With all the talent available for the movie, the viewer has the right to expect a little more from the performances.  Brando and De Niro turn in solid performances, but a viewer might wonder how differently the movie might have played if Brando's role had been somewhat larger.  Norton did admirably, playing off both powerhouses and carrying his own in the scenes.  Angela Bassett was almost wasted in her role as Nick's girlfriend, but she provided Nick an anchor.  Norton's character might have been fleshed out a little better if more of his personal life was revealed.  Still, he did a fantastic job acting as Brian, the night janitor at the Customs House.<br />THE SCORE plays as a riff that most caper movie watchers have seen a number of times before.  There's always another story about a thief about to put his business behind him, except he can't get past the temptation of one more big haul.  Despite the familiarity of the plot line, THE SCORE is definitely worth watching.  People who have enjoyed THE HEIST, SWORDFISH, and OCEAN'S ELEVEN will find much to enjoy with this DVD offering.Michael Caine that always deliver in whatever capacity they sign on for.

B00004RFFM|5.0|I just saw this movie on TV and i just had to come and add it to my wish list.<BR>The basic plot of the movie is great:<BR>Scientists make sharks smarter, they eat people, action and death ensues, loads of fun for the whole family.<BR>Plus, Carter is kinda hot, which makes it even better. :)
B000062XFG|5.0|I am a big fan of TNG and this DVD set does a great job of bringing back TNG again. The features are good and interesting to see how the actors and the show have evolved.<br />The episodes here are good such as Q-Who, Contagion, etc. The characters are now more settle down and even though Pulaski replaces Crusher here, she fits in, even if not perfect. I look forward to the next season DVD, this is when TNG took it to another level.
B000065U1N|5.0|Very engaging, action packed, and most importantly, very accurate to the actual event...
B00003CXPJ|5.0|From the dangers of gasoline fights to brainwashing a la Clockwork Orange to aborigones as models getting a piece of their soul stolen each time they are photographed, this is a very, very funny movie - certainly one of Ben Stiller's best (perhaps not quite as good as Something About Mary).<br />This was a case of turning what was essentially a one-time Saturday Night Live skit (in fact it was a VH-1 skit) and turning it into a full length motion picture.  Unlike most attempts at doing this, this attempt worked and worked well.
B00005NB8J|5.0|This film is truly one of the most underrated films of all time. It totally blew me away when I first saw it in the theatre in 1994. The special effects are mesmerising, the premise is one of the most original I've ever seen, and Ra is totally the greatest sci-fi villain since Darth Vader. <br />My love of this film prompted me to get into the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; TV show, which picks up where the movie left off and expands on themes that were first introduced in the movie. Personally, I think Richard Dean Anderson plays a much better Col. O'Niell than Kurt Russell, and the show has a more engaging cast of characters than the movie did, but I still regard the film as one of my top five favourite movies of all time.

B000002BHE|5.0|Dear Amazonians,<br />This album single-handedly made Celine Dion the 1996 artist of the year.  Not surprising, when you hear the music on this CD.  I remember in 1996, I was on vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands, when I bought this CD.  I was captivated by Celine's mastery of the art of music.  Celine's voice is sharp, and she has total control over the range of pitch that she can produce.  Celine is truly one of the best artists of our time.<br />Even though Celine has come back to performing after having a baby, as well as tending to some personal business, I think this CD remains the best album she has ever produced.  It will be hard for her to break this record, but as anyone knows, only Celine can do it!<br />Rock on!<br />--Daniel
0385503954|4.0|After reading this book, I couldn't help but think through everthing that had happened in the story for a long time. The first few chapters go a little slow but it's important in that it sets the scene up for everything else that is to happen and a great deal happens indeed! Once the characters are introduced and the background it set, the story just took off and it was a joy to read. This book makes you go through a rollercoaster ride of emotions, at one point I was just angry, then I was hit with sadness, then tenderness...it's rare for a book to make me recall all these emotions. The narrative flips back and forth describing the story through different characters points of view. I thought this was extremely effective for this type of story where no one person can see the whole of the truth. But there is so much layers to the story that you almost have to see things from different perspectives. As a reader, you are introduced to all of those view points which makes it very exciting to read. The narrative is beautifully written, the scenes are gripping and somehow manages to convey a lot of emotion through simple descriptions. I thoroghly enjoyed the book and it made me think a lot about the choices that were made by each of the characters in the book, and I was amazed at how each of these decisions have affected the lives of the other characters, in good and in bad ways.

B000007O9L|4.0|Stripped comprises 14 songs from Rolling Stones shows in small venues and \\"unplugged\\" studio performances.  The settings were conducive to the sound quality necessary to make the many classic Stones ballads/slower songs, mostly country blues, that appear on this CD viable for commercial release, and the producers took advantage of the opportunity admirably.  While I acknowledge that comparisons with concerts in large, noisy venues will be imperfect, the group's performances on Stripped appear to be as strong as almost anything they delivered in previous live albums, and a point of emphasis is that the quality is quite consistent (by contrast, refer to Love You Live).  Mick's singing is recorded well and is generally top notch.  The instruments have a very clean sound, crisp with no dross or interference. This is immediately perceptible in the first track, a distinctly acoustic version of \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" and the only noncover that can be described as a rocker.  The high point is the rendition of \\"Like A Rolling Stone,\\" which the group dishes out like real professionals and with feeling.  Still, this CD is most important for those who like the sound of softer songs ranging from \\"Wild Horses\\" to \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" (and the group also dipped back into the vault for \\"I'm Free\\").   If you want to own only two Stones live CDs, this should be one of them.
B000020617|5.0|It seems like the Foo Fighters just keep getting better and better as they go. This is their third album and in my opinion, their best. This is an album that the first time through, I instantly loved every song and couldn't wait to hear it again. It contains the singles &quot;Stacked Actors&quot;, &quot;Learn To Fly&quot;, &quot;Next Year&quot;, &quot;Generator&quot;, and &quot;Breakout&quot;. But it doesn't stop there. The other 6 songs, which include the midtempo number &quot;Ain't It The Life&quot;, and the equally impressive 5 minute long &quot;Aurora&quot;, are just as good as the ones chosen for radio. Not a bad song in the bunch. Dave, as in previous efforts, really delivers some great guitar playing throughout. Dave writes some killer rock tunes with lyrics to match. Taylor Hawkins (drums) and Nate Mendel (bass) make up the rest of the line-up on this release and those two really bring a lot of energy and power to the band as a whole. This is a bit more laid back than their previous efforts, and that is not a bad thing. It's still a rock album filled with great rock tunes. It will be stuck in your stereo for a long time. It's even better than their first album (self titled) and their second (The Colour and The Shape), which I also gave five stars. Well, the Foos are in the studio working on their fourth album and with the way their previous releases sound, they will be sure not to dissappoint. I highly recommend this one to anyone and everyone who wants some good, melodic, and catchy rock 'n roll. Enjoy.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Ever since the creation movies on DVD, I've been waiting for The FOG to reach this format.  It's my ALL-TIME favorite horror film...Carpenter has made us wait LONG ENOUGH!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Watching &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is an experience.Certainly one of the most baffling movies I've ever seen.<BR>Lots of strange characters and images(a Lynch trademark),and a plot that sometimes seems to lead nowhere.<BR>I won't say anything about the story(other reviewers can do a much better job of that),but I will say that the cast (notably Naomi Watts in her dual role) is excellent.The musical score is VERY eerie,and adds to the bizarreness of the film immensely.<BR>The movie is almost 2 1/2 hours long,but it is so engrossing,that it is over before you know it.<BR>Overall,certainly not the most uplifting movie I've ever seen,but very entertaining.And Baffling!
B000002GQG|5.0|This CD starts off with \\"Ride My See-Saw,\\" one of the all-time classics, written by Moody Blues bass guitarist John Lodge.  With supercharged acoustic rhythm guitar, scintillating leads, and wonderful vocal harmonies and mellotron, it is an absolutely breathtaking, electrifying masterwork.  I am always mesmerized by its majesty and power, and it is one of my personal top five rock songs ever.<br />On the remainder of \\"In Search of the Lost Chord,\\" the music and verselines are sweet-sounding but rarely cloyed like those of its predecessor, \\"Days of Future Passed.\\"  Orchestral-type overlays are employed at times, but nothing resembling what was in \\"Days.\\"  The music is elegant English minstrel psychedelia of the late '60s, employing woodwinds at times, in addition to cello and mellotron, autoharp and harpsichord, and frequent pretty vocal harmonies.  A sitar can also be detected on a few tracks, evoking Eastern mysticism.<br />Like Love's \\"Forever Changes,\\" this CD has interesting musical arrangements, and from the preceding discussion it might be inferred that there is more in common between the two, which there is, even in the voices of the singers.  But the songs here are stronger and catchier, and the lyrics are less eccentric, better and prettier, often evoking images of nature.  This is all seen as the real journey begins, with \\"Dr. Livingston, I Presume.\\"  The search takes us to \\"Legend of a Mind\\" (\\"Timothy Leary's Dead\\") and its psychedelia, first somber and later majestic; soars upward with the lovely \\"Voices in the Sky\\"; and captivates with the beautiful \\"Visions of Paradise.\\"  We reach Nirvana with the concluder \\"Om,\\" leaving us enriched musically and, I guess, spiritually.
B000001Y5J|5.0|One of my favourite albums (well, it's an EP, but who cares) of all time. Huge guitar riffs, pounding industro beats, and of course, Reznor's trademark lyrics. Great CD.<BR>Best Tracks: Gave Up, Happiness In Slavery<BR>Worst Track: Last
B000002GQJ|4.0|In \\"A Question of Balance,\\" the Moody Blues explore the meaning and major questions of life in lyrics and music, without excessive orchestral overlays but with no shortage of elaborate vocal harmonies.  Some of the group's music fits into the category of \\"rock\\" only within loosely defined parameters, but when they do the more lively stuff they do it well, here with the very-hard-driving acoustic guitar in the opening title (sort of) cut, as well as \\"Tortoise and the Hare\\" and \\"It's Up to You.\\"  But the Moody Blues have their own sound -- perhaps \\"Minstrel's Song\\" with its \\"love is all around\\" is in a darkhorse sense the quintessential song of these Anglo-Saxon instrumentalists.  Still, the best tracks are probably two beautiful songs:  \\"And the Tide Rushes In\\" and \\"Dawning Is the Day.\\"  Also top notch is \\"Question,\\" but the lyrical, romantic middle part makes the song incoherent.  The finale, \\"The Balance,\\" contains sweeping imagery/statements comparable to those at the end of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" suggesting some self-absorption in the album.  But these and the overall lyrics are still interesting, and \\"A Question of Balance\\" bears witness that the Moody Blues are among the most musically talented and very most listenable groups.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is a great example of how many different styles can fuse together to make a unique style of music. First of all, this is a metal CD. Thrashing guitars and angst ridden chords provide a heavy sound, as well as Chester's haunting screams. Then, they throw some hip-hop elements at you, minus the ego and the repetitive, olbigatory swearing (I want to throw a thesaurus at these rappers). Great rhymes and superb samples. Then it has the catchy, almost pop, hooks, and electronica influences. This CD has great lyrics which I can identify with, and a huge serving of ANGST. A must have for any CD collection.<BR>Best Songs: Papercut, Crawling, Runaway<BR>Worst Songs: None. All are single-worthy.
B00003CXAA|3.0|The Godfather: Brando hams it up. Talia Shire cannot cut it. Some of the commentary is useful. For instance, the scene where Micheal proposes to Kay after returning from Sicily made Coppola uncomfortable because he felt that Micheal's hat made him look like a Rabbi. I never could put my finger on what bothered me about that scene but he's absolutely right.<br />Part II: Coppola re-wrote the script over a weekend to keep Pacino onboard and it shows. Every scene reeks of redundancy. The first film told the story adequately, thus making this interminable sequel a pointless exercise in venality, especially ironic as 'The Godfather' was a critique of big business. Talia's performance improves slightly. Poor Diane Keaton is the recipient of Coppola's slide into corny dialogue: &quot;Our marriage is the abortion! All this must end!&quot;<br />Part III: Mama-mea! A franchise? Get out the Don dolls! Talia becomes the black widow and comes into her own, spitting venom. Poor Dianne: &quot;You are my horror, Micheal!&quot; This is post-comeback Pacino and he slouches around trying to be lovable. Bridget Fonda gives me the horn, though.  A silly film.<br />I revisited 'The Godfather' purely for the acting. As a series it is largely a dreary and masochistic experience. Despite complaints, the DVD picture quality seems okay to me.

B0000524CY|2.0|I've always found this unwatchable, really. One of the big films of that decade, it has two elements, one social realist and the other fantastical, neither complimentary in this case. The scene where Burnstyn begs the priest for help is powerful and I would have been up for a straight drama about his life. It would have meant zero bucks at the box office, but a clearer conscience for everyone. Instead, we get supernatural scenes that are camp and curiously uninvolving, even uninteresting despite the extremities. While I appreciate the theme of Christian sacrifice, I just don't think horror is Friedkin's forte - see 'The Guardian'. His hokey attempts to unsettle the audience with interjected glimpses of the demon betrays his lack of touch with this sort of material. For me, it is too silly.<BR>I would swear Friedkin's voiceover was some sort of post modern joke if I had not been reliably informed by those in the know that Americans have no sense of irony. I also base this on the final conversation between the priest and the detective. Naively, I thought the film reference was a re-assuring nod to the audience and a sly reminder of what used to pass for cinema before more jaded palates prevailed. Friedkin offers a more pedestrian reason for it's inclusion. I think the sleaziest moment in his commentary is his obvious glee at Burnstyn's ascent up the stairs for the crucifix scene. He showed his true colours and the lack of integrity inherent in this sordid commercial enterprise. Surprisingly, for all the boorish, long winded banality of his personality, Bill is a sure hand with actors; although I can't see the point of the priest's conversation on the stairs superceding the original's silence, especially as he had given perfectly reasonable aesthetic reasons for it's exclusion in the first place. I'm being disingenuous, of course. Two versions mean more money. It's still dispiriting that an artist is so willing to disavow his judgement at the drop of a hat, or in thiscase, cheque book.<BR>Max Von Sydow takes a well earned holiday from the existential bleakness of Bergman by getting vomited on by the devil. At least I thought it was the devil. The voice over tells me that it was in fact a demon which I'm unable to spell, offhand. Suffice to say, it is a cross between the act of urination and two trips to a place they keep animals.<BR>A parting thought. Why is it that film characters always seem to have out of body experiences during dream sequences?
B00000J6AG|5.0|PLAY is probably Moby's greatest critical success. It is so engenius at some points, that it makes you wonder if he's a musical god. Great musicianship, outstanding samples that could make any other DJ drool with envy, and big beats. Of course, the entire CD isn't just one Natural Blues over and over again... Great slow, melancholic tracks like 'The Sky Is Broken' also display Moby's incredible talent. Great album, that really did deserve some Grammy awards.<BR>Best Tracks: Bodyrock, Machete, My Weakness<BR>Worst Track: South Side (still good, but almost TOO mainstream for me)
0451191153|5.0|A flooding sensation of being inside the mind of a genius is felt from the beginning of Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\".  However, the genius is not Ms. Rand alone, who is famously known from her homeland of Russia to the United States of America for her writing ability that places you right next to the characters in several astonishing stories.  <BR>Howard Roark is a man whose entire being has been devoted to architecture from his early childhood.  The devotion, indescribable intellect, or both, have enthralled his mind in a way that has let temptations, jealousy, and competition dwindle like dust from his headstrong future.  His mastermind provides him with more than an acute sense of perfection, and almost wild and scary blueprints.  The impeccable accuracy of Rand to detail of both plot and character develops Roark and Peter Keating, his old friend into men you feel you know.  Not only is the story one with a passion for individual integrity shown by Roark, but also of love from Dominique Francon, a uniquely beautiful woman, who didn't always have the courage or heart to be there for the man she truly loved...  The story delves equally into human temperament and into the separate worlds of men, all striving for an equal goal of seeing their mapped future unfold before them. <BR>The unwavering perfection to detail and insight of intricate and multipart characters, mainly grown men, have left me with a feeling of enlightenment and a creepy feeling of human knowledge.  \\"The Fountainhead\\" tells the story of a lonely genius' reach for his love, the obstacles that come up in any businessman or businesswomen's career, and discusses what makes and breaks any man or woman; the ability to follow one's own dream.
B000066F6H|3.0|A lot of energy. This album kind of sounds like the Beatles first album...if the Beatles had been coked up! It's not as a great as some say, but it's better than most of what's out there.

B00005JKCF|4.0|I've never been a fan of the comic book, nor the animated series, yet, I found Sam Raimi's live-action Spiderman quiet entertaining and full of amazing (some) special effects and great acting. <br /> Everyone knows the story. High school nerd, Peter Parker (Tobey MaGuire) is bitten by a genetically enhanced super-spider, and his body changes to the likes of a spider. Enabling him to crawl up buildings, and shoot a webby substance. Peter takes full advantage -- in the positive way -- of his new found skills, and begins to solve crime for the city. When a villain (William Defoe), with superpowers also, begins to destroy the city, Peter must stop him. It's the simple good guy against bad-guy-who-wants-to-destroy-everything plot seen in every superhero movie (Except for X-Men which had a much deeper plot, but let's not compare). But the premise does work here, and keeps you entertained.<br /> The acting was great. Tobey MaGuire is Peter Parker to the core. Innocent, appealing, and a knack for small humor makes him a perfect lead. Kirsten Dunst is our female lead, and she -- as always -- is wonderful. I've never seen her play the damsel in distress part, but she pulled it off. And her smile lights up any day. William Defoe is the antagonist Green Goblin. Defoe handled this part fairly well and made it believable. Especially during the moments when he had to be Norman Osburn and The Green Goblin. But I just didn't buy his whole character. I found it more interesting when Peter was fighting off criminals. Except for the World Day Celebration scene. That was awesome. The rest of the supporting cast were great. Especially Uncle Ben, played by Cliff Robertson.<br /> The special effects is the place where it gets kind of hokey. You can absolutely tell when Peter is CGI and when he's not. The whole CGI bit is what puts it off, but still, it's topnotch. The scenery is great, and gave the movie a real comic book feel to it. But again, I go back to not liking the Green Goblin much. His costume looked like my kid cousin's Halloween costume from 5 years ago. But maybe that's what Raimi was going for. <br /> In the end, Spiderman was an entertaining movie that sucked you in. It's high gross rankings are certainly well deserved.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I can't believe that as I write this is the Number One CD on Amazon because I've been playing it continuously, all week. <br />Her voice is soft and laconic and a real pleasure to hear. Also, it's easy to write, read, or just clean the house while Norah Jones keeps you company. <br />Very much recommend this, but then word must have gotten out for it to be selling so well. Buy it, if you didn't already.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man is a super hero that has been a part of my life for a very long time ever since I was old enough to understand the meaning of the words \\"With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.\\" Everything about Spider-Man was unorthodox, mainly due to the character's status in the world as both Peter Parker and as Spider-Man... Peter Parker is an outcast due to his vast intelligence, and eagerness for learning which, in effect ostracizes him from the rest of the human race.  Spider-Man, meanwhile has a problem, due to the constant paranoia of the people, due to their uncertainty of what to make of him. A paranoia that is fueled by an untrustworthy J. Jonah Jameson's propaganda. These elements have made Spider-Man such an appealing character for me to grow up watching, and believe you/me I have. I spent all my childhood watching reruns of the old 1960's cartoon, then it was the old 1980's cartoon, and finally the sublime 1990's animated series. Though there was also a touch of the overly silly 1970's live action series. So obviously I've been eagerly awaiting Spider-Man to web-sling into a new medium, preferably the cinema.... Well finally my wish has been granted and it's beautiful!!! I will admit this was a frightening wait for the movie to come along. Especially when I keep hearing about changes in the stories and even with certain tidbits of the production, I was on pins and needles. I mean come on! If Cameron directed DiCaprio would've been Spider-Man! I don't think so! So when I heard about the changes in personnel I was seeing the ray of hope. Firstly Sam Raimi as director. at the time the news was announced I was just becoming a fan of his thanks to the beautiful \\"Evil Dead\\" Trilogy, and so I knew that Raimi was a director with a disciplined visual style, a knack for character depth, and an appealing sense of humor. So \\"Spider-Man\\" was right up his alley. As for the man who would be the spider? Tobey Maguire had earned my respect the first time I saw him in\\"Pleasantville\\" I saw that he can play humble, while at the same time strong in both the mind and body, and to top it all off HE CAN ACT!!! Don't believe me? Watch \\"Cider House Rules,\\" watch \\"Wonder Boys,\\" you'll see what I mean. If there was any assurance about Spider-Man being great, the credit definitely goes to Raimi and Maguire. Don't fret there's more credit to be sorted out, sit tight. The next aspect of credit goes to Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn AKA The Green Goblin. I knew Dafoe was perfect for the role after I saw him in \\"Shadow of the Vampire,\\" and obviously I wasn't disappointed. Probably for me his performance was at it's most effective in the scenes in his room. Whereas Osborn speaks to the Goblin in the mirror which gives me a fond recollection of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde which, in a symbolic sense is exactly what is happening to Osborn. Since we're talking about one Osborn lets talk about another. Let's Talk about James Franco as Harry. Franco automatically gained my sympathy at the first moment you meet him and truly gained the believability of being Dafoe's son.<BR>Oh, and speaking of believability, nothing filled me with more mirth than J.K. Simmons' Dead-on portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson, he's a fast talking, obnoxious, opportunist who for some reason or another trusts his barber as opposed to the plain facts. As for other obvious mentionables, there's Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben who show this beautiful commitment to their characters and you see their eagerness to ensure that Peter is raised right. Now if there was a surprise in this cast it was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. At first glance of her in the trailer, you think \\"Oh, eye candy, just there to be saved all the time.\\" Not even! Her performance succeeded in giving the character the depth and dimension that must be expected in the \\"Spider-Man\\" world. Plus... she looks bloody good as a red head. Now onto technical aspects... I could really care less about special effects and CGI as long as they're believable and it succeeds in getting the point across as to what's supposed to happen. Fortunately these effects combined with Sam Raimi's wonderful cinematic vision deliver a completely energetic cinematic rush that has truly never been seen before. As for the script. David Koepp was the last guy I'd have wanted to write for it, but he ended up proving me wrong. He managed to tell Spider-Man's legacy with that same humanity and flair that embodies the characters, though I won't say the script is flawless. It does suffer moments where the characters say the occasional line that reeks of Saturday morning cartoons. Thankfully I can tell that Sam Raimi noticed this and took advantage of that to add in his genius input to make the dialogue less painful and more appealing. I'm not gonna get into the costumes... Spidey looks the way he needs to look, and Goblin looks the way he's supposed to look when the suit was made by a high-tech research organization. So stop complaining you silly obsessives and enjoy it.<BR>   So, in conclusion I will say that Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire have done for \\"Spider-Man\\" what Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve did for \\"Superman.\\" AND what Tim Burton and Michael Keaton did for \\"Batman\\"(Figured I'd add that in.) But Finally A Hollywood feature with a load of hype that actually managed to support the hype. Could this be a glimpse of great things to come? I hope so! But basically I say SEE \\"SPIDER-MAN!!!\\" and SEE IT AGAIN!!!
B00004WGAI|5.0|This movie is excellent and well worth the time and money.  No other film based on Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre even comes close to it.  The actors / actresses are brilliant and the scenery imaginable when reading the text.  I agree with the other reviews above except for the favorite line, &quot;Is there a fire?&quot;  It is &quot;Is there a flood?&quot; It took place when she doused him with all the water to wake him up.  Just to clarify.
B00005JKCF|4.0|It's rare to see a movie that is both entertaining and compelling.  It's also rare to see a mass-market movie that isn't laden with cliches.  The lead story, Peter Parker's coming of age, is surprising in its depth and sincerety.  Equally so is how developed Mary Jane's character was, particularly in light of the fact that the majority of the film's running time is reserved for Spider Man and Green Goblin's origins-and of course the action scenes.  The film merits four stars because it has heart, a rare element in Hollywood films of any stripe, let alone the action blockbuster.  How can you not root for a superhero that was a bigger dork than you were in high school?  Plus, this movie is really cool.
B00000JCB2|1.0|How in the hell could anyone like this? Any body that writes songs this bad should have their face hit really hard with a hammer. What ever you do don't buy this or any rap-metal or nu-metal. I would give it -10 stars if I could.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When this film aired in the theaters, I had no desire to see it. It was marketed by trying to sell viewers to see Brad Pitt, which doesn't work for me - I need more than star power to see a movie. I believe its very hard to advertise for without giving away anything that makes it so unique. But I caught it late night on cable and LOVED it. I love movies that suprise me, and this one did.<br />I can't get into too much detail for fear of giving any of the good stuff away, but suffice it to say that both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt deserve Oscars for their roles. Norton as the quirky, mild-mannered, easy going guy who has allied himself with the exact opposite outlandish Brad Pitt character.<br />A definite must see for anybody wanting to see a movie different from most of the mindless, heartless, and plotless movies made today.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|With Mulan, Disney has come up with as flawless an animated film as can be. All the characters are well-defined (and a little exaggerated in true Disney fashion), and all play their parts. There is no part of the film which seems contrived. The music is excellent, the songs are appropriate and the storyline is very plausible. The actors who have given voice to the characters have elevated the film considerably too, especially Eddie Murphy as the bumbling dragon Mu-Shu. I will not bore other reviewers with the story- but I would exhort them to acquire this masterpiece. It is one movie which I enjoy a lot, inspite of the fact that I am not a child anymore.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This isn't as good as Guy Ritchie's first film \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\", but its still a great film. Ritchie went with what worked from his last film and incorporated it into a different story about a diamond. Ritchie likes to get into detail with each of his characters. Each gets his own intro, and some get their own themes. This helps the audience relate better to the characters and understand them better.<br />Overall, there are a lot of sub-plots and stars in this great flick about the search for \\"a diamond the size of a fist\\". A lot of action, snappy dialogue, and plot twisting is involved.<br />But be forewarned, if you don't like films where most of the characters have accents, use a lot of slang, and try to kill people  .... then go watch a freakin' Disney movie and keep living in happy happy land.
038533558X|5.0|I have only recently become a fan of Harlan Coben.  I've read Darkest Fear, Tell No One, and Gone For Good.  I had the hardest time putting this book down and finished within two days of practically nonstop reading.  What a fabulous story line.  So realistic and believable.  I sincerely hope that the author follows up with a sequel as there are many stories left to pursue with the characters he has developed.
B000050FEN|5.0|This film did an excellent job in portraying the mind of a sick individual. The film is dark (and I don't mean the lighting), and is filmed mostly in the rain to help increase the general dreary atmosphere. The actors do a great job at helping the audience relate to them and understand their individual point of views. Although Brad Pitt's &quot;method acting&quot; in his first scene of the movie was somewhat - not cool. He rebounds and does an excellent job of conveying the general feeling of the audience in the final scenes. But I can't say what he does without ruining it for anyone who has yet to see this masterpiece of a sick mind.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem will always keep himself on the public's mind by using extreme and shocking subject matter in his songs, but decades from now, his undeniable talent will keep his name alive. <BR>   His third full-length CD, The Eminem Show, hits the stores of a much different America than before, when both The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP brought him critical and commercial success. The rapper has obviously become more reclusive and contemplative, and it comes through in the new songs so clearly and intelligently that the shock appeal actually loses its front seat status.<BR>   If his last set proved worthy of an album of the year Grammy nomination, Show deserves to win the award. Not only does Eminem continue to address critics, the government, and personal enemies with well-thought-out insults and lyrical poison, he attacks himself with just as much venom. <BR>   His messages far from one-sided, he talks tough but true about his past actions and regrets. From first track to last, the album works as a verbalization of a poet's overworked mind, and the beats ain't bad either. <BR>   The first half of Show builds on past controversy and content, such as Eminem's ongoing struggle with his mother (\\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\") and his alleged assault on a man kissing his wife outside a club (\\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\"). While cynics and critics might feel inclined to shout, \\"who cares?\\" at these subjects, Eminem knows his fans want to hear his thoughts about them. Some of the most well respected literature in the world tackles biographical subjects, so what's different about rap music?<BR>   Halfway through the CD, the songs have put a unique and refreshing perspective on everything from the artist's life to the War on Terrorism, and one begins to wonder how the songs can build or progress anymore than they already have. Well, after track No. 10, the CD's first single \\"Without Me,\\" ends, Mathers moves into a breathtaking seven-song opus that would impress even the most jaded rap haters.<BR>   Most relevant artists have one song in their careers that fully identifies their reason for being, and \\"Sing for the Moment\\" does that for Eminem. Using purposeful samples from the underrated Aerosmith classic \\"Dream On,\\" each verse beautifully portrays a different facet or motivation of the rapper's career, and it ends with a message that explains the appeal of rap music better than anything ever has. <BR>   Another risky but unforgettable move comes in \\"Hailie's Song,\\" where Eminem drops any remains of his tough exterior and actually sings about his daughter's effect on his life. Complete with recorded harmonies and soft vocal stylings, he transforms himself into something much more real than any microphone `gangsta' or sex-obsessed hustler.<BR>   Any reasonable person, including the rapper himself, would say The Eminem Show isn't for children, who would have trouble getting past the profanity and adult themes to fully recognize the messages. But adults who love both rap and literature will see the merit and meaning in this record. <BR>   Whether the lyrics get the same amount of protest and attention they have gotten before, the artistry of Eminem will only make a positive mark on rap and all other forms of music.

B00000JGHM|5.0|I won't repeat everything else you'll read here about the superb acting and direction.  I will, however, call out what makes this movie special: no one does anything stupid.<br />Most movie story lines rely on an error in judgement on the part of the protagonist to advance the plot.  Both sides here do everything right, brilliantly so, up until the end.  You may find yourself thinking &quot;Hey, if I were a criminal, that's exactly how I'd do it&quot;.  And I don't mean hokey &quot;crime of the century&quot; stuff, I mean real-life criminal jobs.  Same for the police, largely.<br />Ths music is also excellent.  I hardly ever specifically notice the music in a film, but it really helped make this one!
B00005N56Y|5.0|Decca has wisely chosen Curzon's recordings of these Mozart concertos for reissue in their \\"Legends\\" series. Nos. 20 and 27 with Britten and the English Chamber Orchestra are absolutely classic, nos. 23 and 24 with Kertesz and the London Symphony hardly less so. Curzon was at his best in Mozart. His playing is stylish, elegant, and expressive within the context of Mozart's period, without exaggeration or idiosyncrasy. The sound is excellent and has been successfully remastered. The only snag is that no. 26 is split between the two CDs, but since this is the least popular of these concertos anyway this probably won't matter all that much. Highly recommended, and a tremendous bargain at this price (I paid almost this much a few years back just for these recordings of concertos nos. 20 and 27!).
6302517036|4.0|Like a lot of others who have posted a review, I first saw this film when I was kid. I've seen it probably about 70 times since. It's one of those great films that makes you laugh, your skin crawl and screams to have the lines recited along with it. <br />Another thing, IMHO, Chris Sarandon's vampire - Jerry Dandridge - has got to be the most sexy, sensual, menacing one in the history of film. From 'Nosferatu' all the way to Omar Epps, Sarandon is *still* my favorite vampire in cinema and that is saying a lot!

This record ROCKS. The same sound, for the most part, but he's added guitars.  He steals the chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On for one the album's best songs, but every track has something special. 'Without Me' is the 1st single, but there are 10 songs here as good or better. My favorite is 'White America,' the opening number: <br />\\"Surely hip hop is never a problem in Harlem only in Boston after it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom\\"

B000059XUP|1.0|While many of the images in \\"The Crow - City of Angels\\" will stay with you, viewers will come away from this pretentious sequel wishing that the director's/writer's better selves had taken the helm. This murky sequel to the entertaining \\"The Crow,\\" starring the late Brandon Lee, has the dark gothic taste down pat. Unfortunately, images of torture, sexual orgies and sadism exploit fans of this genre lowering the series to the worst denominator.<br />At times laughably bad and amazingly inept, \\"The Crow - City of Angels\\" subtitutes style and the unique with typical and has-been. Vincent Perez certainly looks the part of the brooding anti-hero, risen from the dead to avenge the murder of his son. And Mia Kirshner makes a fine heroine, a pseudo tatoo-artist mentor who leads Perez into his predictable odyssey through a Los Angeles futuristic netherworld of drug addicts, sexual deviants and homeless children. But where this sequel loses direction is in its glorification of brutality - from prisoners of the main villain, to innocent victims in the streets of this civilization where the sun never rises.<br />Certainly the character of The Crow, an inspired combination of Batman, the Vampire Lestat and Ozzy Osbourne, is the stuff fueled by imaginative adolescent nightmares. This series will always have at least that going for it. Trenchcoats, motorcycles, smeared make-up, bad hair days - The Crow must rank as one of the hippest superheroes in history. And occasionaly director Tim Pope (obviously schooled at the MTV film institute) produces a strong image or two in spite of himself. The Crow lounging on the side of a building is the stuff of great blacklight posters. The Crow marching down a dark alleyway towards a retreating villain is an impressive portrait.<br />But for all these visions, the viewer is force-fed the typical - the wooden Iggy Pop as a mannequin villain, the unexceptional Richard Brooks as a one-note ringleader of evil, the faceless Thuy Trang as a high-kicking murderess. Undoubtedly \\"The Crow - City of Angels\\" has been inspired by multiple films of Japanese cinema, popularized in Western culture by the works of John Woo and mimicked by Hollywood with \\"The Matrix,\\" and there are times when squinting your eyes just right, you might be able to see English subtitles (I am kidding, of course).<br />But then comes the predictable B-Movie scenes of brutality, the obvious symbolism of the Day of the Dead celebration, and the excessive servings of faceless murder. And the final conflict of this contrived drama, where what appears to be thousands of crows fly through the soul of the main villain, is about as lazy a resolution/triumph as you will ever see in a film. <br />Darkness comes from a tortured soul, and it has far more depth than \\"The Crow - City of Angels\\" could ever hope to dream of. This film is indeed a nightmare, but for all the wrong reasons.
0800141806|4.0|This movie brings forth the social issues that our society deals with everyday.  The highlight of this movie isn't the courtroom drama, as I initially thought.  Instead, the strengths are the emotions that the characters portray.  This movie doesn't merely deal with the discrimination against the AIDS virus and homosexuality.  It deals with bias and segregation in a broad landscape.  Andy Bennett (Tom Hanks) was fired from his job mainly because of his sexual preference.  He was defended by Joe Miller (Denzel Washington).  Hanks and Washington are powerhouse actors and they work well together.  I particularly didn't like the female defense lawyer for Wheeler and Co.  She somehow didn't \\"fit,\\" or maybe her acting was just not convincing enough for me.  I thought this movie would have some dramatic courtroom scenes, like those from \\"Rules of Engagement\\" and \\"A Few Good Men.\\"  But I was a little dissappointed.  The DVD does not pack any extra whatsoever.  Despite, these limitation, this movie is enjoyable to watch due to the great acting of Hanks and Washington.

B000005IU2|5.0|Make no mistake about it this is a polarizing album that isn't for the faint of heart.  There isn't a melody to be found on this monster, instead the listener is bashed with an aural barrage of discordant noise and anger that will either leave you thrilled or running for the door.  This is a classic that needs to be listened to in one continuous sitting as all the songs run together creating a stunning masterpiece.  There is no middle-ground regarding this CD either it's your cup of tea or it isn't.  For those that like their music loud, defiant and unhinged get this CD.
B00006690F|5.0|I managed to get my hands on the CD on Saturday, much to my surprise and delight.  First of all, what makes this CD different from the previous ones is that Eminem was kind enough to include the lyrics to all the songs.  I think this was a good move on his part because the written word is where he shines.  Second, this CD is more reflective and addresses current events and his recently settled legal problems, so I thought it was more focused than the Marshall Mathers LP.  Eminem is no kinder and no gentler, in case any of you were thrown off by the first single, \\"Without Me.\\"  If you don't believe me, listen carefully to \\"White America,\\" \\"Superman,\\" and \\"Sing for the Moment,\\" which offer on point commentaries about racism, the trappings of fame, white middle class insecurity, and the alienation of the young.  This CD is less radio-friendly, so I'd listen to it the whole way through and pay attention to the lyrics rather than expect to be drawn in solely by a catchy bassline.  He hasn't gotten tired of telling the world to...off, but he is more mature about it, if you can accept it.
B000063DFQ|4.0|Iron Maiden's second album with Bruce Dickinson is another winner.  Like its predecessor \\"Number Of The Beast,\\" \\"Piece Of Mind\\" is a musical tour de force that is limited only by the inclusion of a few sub-par tracks.  The opening song \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is an excellent song that sets the tone for this briskly paced set.  Highlights include \\"The Trooper,\\" \\" Flight Of Icarus,\\" \\"Revelations,\\" \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" and \\"Die With Your Boots On.\\"  The filler that takes up the second half of the album is what keeps this release from attaining truly classic status.  \\"Still Life,\\" \\"Quest For Fire,\\" \\"Sun And Steel,\\" and \\"To Tame A Land\\" are all competently performed tracks, but all are a step-down from the fantastic first half of the album.  All in all this is a must own CD for any Iron Maiden or heavy metal fan.  Great guitars, Steve Harris' trademark galloping bass lines, excellent drumming, and first rate vocals by Dickinson.  After this release Maiden would begin their slow descent into mediocrity that reached its nadir on later albums \\"Fear Of The Dark,\\" \\"X-Factor,\\" and \\"Virtual IX.\\"
B000000WFF|5.0|The Spice Girls, those glitter-besotted pottymouth disciples of mayhem, continued their history-making bubblegum crusade against the decadent relics of grunge on this, the second of two albums that would kick in a new pop era of bouncy, glowing optimism and divinely frivolous tunes.  But none who came after could reach the fever-pitch exhilaration they managed on song after song.  \\"Spiceworld\\" takes off on a euphoric trip through the archetypal pop formats-- Motown, disco, even showtunes--to create a global groove for the dancing masses of teens, tweens, kids and adults who all fell under the spell of these fiercely independent pop princesses.  \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" swirls with carnaval percussion and a wriggling, jungle-inspired beat; its an Oasis-like wall of sound built out of Latin rhythms and the patented Spice hooks.  \\"Stop\\" is their inspired Supremes homage, dizzying in its joyous recreation of that classic sound.  \\"Too Much\\" is the first brooding ballad, more jazzy than \\"2 Become One\\" but similarly lush and lovestruck-- just listen and consider how very, very far everyone else on the scene is from creating slow tunes with such mastery.  \\"Saturday Night Divas\\" slinks along with a dazzlingly orchestrated syncopation.  The floor-stomping \\"Never Give Up On the Good Times\\" represents a pinnacle of energy, even on this disc of flushed-cheek dance tunes-- this disco anthem shakes and shimmys in  ecstatic release, the explosion of positve energy that is the Spice Girls' trademark.  And on and on and on.  \\"Move Over\\" punkishly extends the Pepsi-commercial theme into a song on Girl Power revolution.  \\"Do It\\" lays down the feminist 'rules are for fools' theme, with a swooningly delicious bridge sweeter than melted ice cream (thanks especially to Emma on that one).  \\"Denying\\" is a sultrier sort of R&B tune, somewhat akin to the \\"Forever\\" album's material with its smoldering lover's anger.  On the second ballad, \\"Viva Forever\\", the Spice Girls express a shockingly Neo-Platonic conception of life (\\"Live forever, for the moment/ Ever searching, for the one\\") in dreamy lyrics that express fervent yearning,  over a swelling orchestral arrangement with touches of Spanish flavor.  Yes, and then there's the closing number, \\"Lady is a Vamp\\" where the Spice Girls salute their culture-heroes in a rousing, comic piece of burlesque.  Whether as solo artists or a group, we'll certainly continue to enjoy the show.  \\"Spiceworld\\", in each and every song, is a monument in pop history, an artifact as enduring as \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" or the \\"Immaculate Collection\\".  As writers and performers, the Spice Girls achieved new heights of energetic bliss, and \\"Spiceworld\\" remains a must for all who would know how great pop can be.
B00006690F|5.0|Those who say that Eminem a.k.a. slim shady, marshall mathers have not listened to the depth of his new cd The eminem show. In a interview eminem states \\" don't try to out do me because I am gonna be the biggest smart ... and no one can out do me\\" His record proves this even more that 2000's The Marshall mathers Lp. Yes eminem still takes shots at celebrities that he dislikes but not as much. And he still takes shots at his mom but mainly on cleaning out my closet. The cd mainly is about America, the generation that is in America currently and about how much he loves his daughter hailie. Eminem has some excellent views and with the beats, makes this album excellent if you are in any doubt of eminems supurb skills as a poet, spokesman of this generation or as a rap artist this cd will put away all those doubts.<BR>jj<BR>hazadous2001@yahoo.com
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I liked it when I first listened, although at first I admitt the computerized voice stuff was distracting. The more I listened to the CD, the more I liked it. The more you listen, the more you hear. This is one CD where I enjoy every track. I listen to it so much that I am tempted to buy another one so I have one for the house and one for the car. I never felt that way about a CD before, especially after having it as long as I have had it. I ordered it right when it came out. Spiritual, sensual, funky, he is still the best, and this is one of his best. The only thing better......was the ONA tour live. Hearing songs from this CD live is absolutely incredible. My favories on the CD are 1+1+1 is 3, mellow, she loves me 4 me, the everlasting now, last december, family name, TRC, and everywhere.
B00006690F|5.0|1. Curtains Up (Intro) - It's an intro, so nothing to get excited over (N/A)<br />2. White America - Eminem raps about his views of America and does it well.  Blasts some top-shelf political figures too. (5/5)<br />3. Business - Classic Eminem.  Party type of beat with Eminem dropping some funny lyrics. (5/5)<br />4. Cleaning Out My Closet - Eminem's anything-but-loving ode to his mother.  Really powerful song that makes you feel for what Eminem has gone through. (5/5)<br />5. Squaredance - Really new sound for Eminem.  I think it works really good.  The beat is crazy and he takes time out to demolish Canibus with only two or three lines. (5/5)<br />6. The Kiss (Skit) - An okay skit.  Tells about the night he pistol whipped the bouncer for allegedly kissing his wife. (N/A)<br />7. Soldier - The beat is ok and the lyrics are tight, but overall, i'm just not feeling this song.  Something about it isn't too appealing. (3/5)<br />8. Say Goodbye Hollywood - Nice production value and Eminem is always spitting lyrics that touch on personal subjects.  Good song. (4/5)<br />9. Drips - One funny song about the dangers of un-protected sex.  Obie Trice, Shady Records new artist, drops some hilarious rhymes and almost out does Eminem with his potent lyrics. (4/5)<br />10. Without Me - Great lead single off this album.  Lyrics are funnier towards the end.  Only problem is that this song sounds too much like D-12's hit of last summer \\"Purple Pills.\\" (4/5)<br />11. Paul Rosenberg (skit) - Funny skit from Eminem's attorney who tells Eminem not to shoot off his gun in public.  Funny and short. Serves its purpose. (N/A)<br />12. Sing for the Moment - Great use of the Aerosmith song \\"Dream On.\\"  This is the type of song Eminem shines on.  Great beat, excellent lyrics and Joe Perry.  What a combo! (5/5)<br />13. Superman - Deep bass beat for Eminem to spit funny lyrics about the reasons he won't get deeply involved with another female.  Funny stuff towards the end. (5/5)<br />14. Hallie's Song - Shocked this reviewer when I head Eminem starting to actually SING!  Struck me as odd too, but Eminem holds his own.  Touching song. (5/5)<br />15. Steve Berman (skit) - Seemingly, the last skit with Mr. Berman since Em shoots him at the end.  The skit with him on the D-12 album was the funniest though.  This one is ok. (N/A)<br />16. When the Music Stops - Eminem and D-12 show off incredible lyrical structure over one of the best beats i've heard in a while.  Bizarre actually is funny on this song, too. (5/5)<br />17. Say What You Say - This is the battle track of the album.  Eminem and Dr. Dre go back and forth ripping one anothers current foes.  I would hate to be JD right now. (4/5)<br />18. 'Til I Collapse - This is the best song on the album.  With a hip-hop sound mixed with \\"We Will Rock You,\\" you get a hype song with Nate Dogg helping out on the chorus. (5/5)<br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy - Eminem's duet with his daughter Hallie.  Hallie is really funny on this song.  Eminem also drops potent lyrics.  Great closing song. (5/5)<br />20. Curtains Close (outro) - THE RETURN OF KEN KANIFF!!  I was wondering if Eminem was going to leave him out.  Funny skit with Ken reciting his own lyrics to parts of \\"Without Me.\\" (N/A)<br />In the end, this is a very well-rounded album.  I hope Eminem stays on top of his game for the rest of his career.
B00006690F|4.0|He's done it again!<br />In The Eminem Show, we see that Em's lyrical skills are as deft as ever. As usual, the production is tight. Best tracks: #2,3,4,5,9,10,13,16,17,18,19. As you can see, fans will not be disappointed.
B00005JKJA|5.0|You will either love this or hate this, and you should know already which camp you are in.  Actually, if you don't know whether you fall into abhor or adore, you'll hate it.  Go away.  <br />Mulholland Drive requires that you think, which seems to offend and enrage a great many moviegoers (see reviews everywhere).  <br />I don't mind thinking.  My pet peeves are continuity, historical accuracy (as appropriate), and lapses in logic - and some lacking in these three areas ruins most movies for me.  Happily, Mr. Lynch's films all tilt off-axis from the get-go, negating my usual concerns and leaving me free to enjoy the pictures... <br />I think there are several ways to &quot;read&quot; this movie, and as I've found, the storylines can realign themselves post-viewing to provide an entirely different perspective.  But, basically, there are two different girls with the same face, and one imagines the other.  Whether she does it to make herself feel better or worse is debatable... One could argue that there are parts of the story which are lived or imagined by other characters in yet another sequence of events in or out of synch with the main character(s).  This sounds so complicated, but it's simple onscreen.  And Naomi Watts was cheated - she should have received nominations, if not awards.  Hopefully, she will avoid the seeming curse of Lynch's leading ladies - all doing their best work for him, then sliding into obscurity (arty obscurity is still obscure) (when was the last time you saw Sheryl Lee in anything?)<br />If you struggled through &quot;Lost Highway,&quot; and eventually &quot;got it&quot; or some semblance of &quot;it,&quot; then you'll be pleased to see how  gracefully those ideas are put into practice here - a much less gimmicky set of characters, and a much deeper emotional resonance.

6304401132|5.0|\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" has always been something of an anomaly in the Disney canon.  There isn't another movie like it, animated or otherwise, and its tendency to go overlooked renders the distinction all the more tragic.  With all due respect to \\"Pinocchio,\\" \\"Bambi, \\"Fantasia,\\" \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\\"  they're just not \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\"<br />Walt Disney made his sixteenth animated feature (and there is no more appropriate number for this particular fairy tale) at a volatile stage in his studio career, and the final product reflects many experimental but surprisingly harmonious influences.  The entrancing score was taken from an original ballet by Tchaikovsky, and the animation, clearly derived from medieval imagery, has both an astonishing purity and a curious quaintness.  It doesn't leap off the screen the same way \\"Snow White\\" does, and the human characters, many of whom are intentionally comic as opposed to heroic figures, don't have nearly as much fullness or dimension.<br />\\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" based on a story by Charles Perrault, transforms that vice into a virtue.  What to make, after all, of a fairy tale whose heroine spends most of the movie out of commission?  Well, if you're Walt Disney, you relegate the near-perfunctory love story to the backburner while the Good Fairies and Maleficent calmly steal the picture.  A risky solution, but in this case, the best one.  Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who were inspired by real-life old ladies at the supermarket (Merryweather, in particular, is so cute you wish you could keep her on your bookshelf), have an intoxicating fussiness, and their conversation sparkles with the sort of pleasant banter you can enjoy as a child and enjoy even more as an adult.  As for Maleficent (magnificently voiced by Eileen Audley), running neck-and-neck with \\"The Little Mermaid's\\" Ursula for the title of all-time greatest Disney villain, she's a wickedly charismatic presence, as chillingly beautiful as she is demonic.<br />Scene for scene, \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" has more imaginative visual curlicues and hidden-gem sequences than nearly any other Disney movie.  To watch the film a second, third or fiftieth time is to be in a state of constant anticipation of the next glorious set-piece, whether it's the harrowing extended climax -- a truly thrilling clash between good and evil, and a considerably more violent spectacle than we're accustomed to in movies like this -- or a moment as simple and luminous as the Fairies disappearing into a jewelry case.<br />The animators have employed a higher degree of stylization and more surreal touches than usual (watch the early scenes in which the Fairies bestow their individual gifts upon the princess), complemented in full by Tchaikovsky's marvelous music.  I can't remember when I've seen such an impressive confluence of sound and image, such a seamless match-up between the nuances of melody and rhythm and the accompanying shifts in color and movement.  The score is unapologetically devoid of Broadway-style numbers and tongue-in-cheek lyrics (there is one musical sequence featuring the requisite \\"cute\\" rabbits, robins, squirrel and owl, none of whom, thankfully, burst into song), lending the film a timeless classicism that today's animation, steeped in pop-culture references and misguided attempts at Gen-Y appeal, can only dream of.<br />I watched \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" recently for the first time in nearly a decade, and the experience was like reuniting with a very old, very eccentric friend.  I could analyze it to death (I probably already have), but fairy tales, especially Disney fairy tales, aren't made to withstand academic scrutiny.  They're made to be remembered, not as a homogeneous mishmash of stale happy endings, but as individual vintages, each with its own vivid flavors and memories.  \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" -- to quote a lesser classic, the fairest of them all -- is a film to savor and cherish.
0060987464|5.0|MM's story is not for the faint of heart, but more for those who have always known that Human Nature is not actually what we might like it to be, or believe it to be.  But I would still highly recommend it for everyone!<br />I believe the events told by MM are all very accurate.  Also, I truly believe that whatever people see and feel about MARILYN MANSON, is actually whatever is in themselves.  Many people just see the sex and drugs.  What I see is raw truth (Human Nature), and as a person, be it MM or Brian, from the very start, I can clearly see his individual Humanity (morality) shine through like an absolute, bright star!<br />MM has greatly matured as a person, and therefore, as an artist/writer.  And I believe that after all the philosophical arguments over right/wrong have worn themselves out, in the end, the truth prevails: there are no standards of right and wrong, there's only our Maturity.<br />Try it, you might like it!!!
B00005YW4H|3.0|My feelings about this album fall somewhere in the middle of previous reviews. I would have given it three and a half stars but didn't see that as an option.  Make no mistake, Norah Jones is a breath of fresh air in the jazz (with a little bit of country)female vocalist arena.  Those like me who were dismayed at Diana Krall's fall into glam-jazz-for-easy-listening should take heart that Norah Jones represents a fresh voice.  There are great songs, namely &quot;Don't know why I didn't come&quot; and others.  Much of the album however does feel repetitive and can become little more than sophisticated background music.  That said, the potential for greatness is definetly there and this is hardly a bad first effort - give her a chance folks!! And for goodness sake, keep this woman away from Ballard who managed to ruin the very promising Shelby Lynne.
B000063UR2|5.0|I love Jerry Goldsmiths' music in this film and the nice thing about DVD is that you can just flip the TV off and just enjoy the music.  Unfortunately, Jerry's score simply doesn't cut it for what this film was meant to be marketed for (teenage boys and girls).  When I saw this as a teenager in the local cineplex I fell in love with it and the music of Tangerine Dream was something of a marvel since a mythical movie had never really been made with an 80's mosaic sound.  If Jerry's musical score had been kept it would have just bored me to tears being a crazy teenager having just seen Tom Cruise in &quot;Risky Business.&quot;<br />After years and years of embattlement, the movie studio has finally allowed Jerry's score to be released with a Directors Cut of the film.  Yet even after all these years I still long for the Tangerine Dream score!  The Directors Cut of the film is a much different film, loaded with dramatic and character developments which go right along with the more sophisticated Goldsmith score, while the Tangerine Dream version is a far more &quot;summer-like movie&quot; with faster edits and get-to-the-point scene changes.  Considering the Directors cut is 20 minutes longer, I opt for the shorter version simply because it moves quicker and has a more appealing edge and gets the job done far more efficiently.  Having Tangerine Dreams' classic score to listen to over and over is quite a treat as well!
B00005Y23E|5.0|I already had the First Legend Set but this One also Offers Longer Versions&Re-Mixes.the Great thing about Bob Marley is that no matter how many times you listen to His Material you still find yourself Hearing something new&makes it that much more challenging to the Ear&Presentation.Bob Marley understood the Depth&Power of Words&Music.I have quite a few Records of His but if you are just starting out&wondering what Makes Bob the Great Musical Genius He was this will answer that&so much more.the Man Poured His Heart into His Craft&Left a Strong Imprint on Music.THe MAN is World Music&People Music more Importantly.
B000002MFN|5.0|Alongside Ray of Light, alongside Like A Prayer...this album is one of Madonna's best of all-time (definitely in her top 4 albums ever). How could it be so forgotten?! Apparently NO ONE realized this album was even released. This is some of the best work Madonna has ever produced; sexy (but not pornographic), daring (but not over the top), raises awareness (but doesn't preach), and it makes you dance!<BR>1. Erotica-the awesome title track. The house beat, haunting vocals, that infamous bass-line...what more could you want?!<BR>2. Fever-Madonna's cover of Peggy Lee's classic. This is Madonna's best cover EVER. This song even rivals Justify My Love in sexiness.<BR>3. Bye Bye Baby-Another dance song, this one slightly more tongue-in-cheek. Gets you movin'<BR>4. Deeper And Deeper-First off, this is my FAVORITE Madonna song EVER! of ANY album! It's totally disco, flamboyant, and FABULOUS. Worth the entire album.<BR>5. Where Life Begins-if you get what she's singing about, you can't help but blush! This is a smooth little number.<BR>6. Bad Girl-One of her best vocal performances. It's also one of the songs that really keeps this album from going over the top...it keeps it grounded. Great song.<BR>7. Waiting-another sassy little number...very soulful.<BR>8. Thief Of Hearts-this song is fierce. Don't wanna mess with Madonna's man!<BR>9. Words-another dance tune with a catchy hook. Great verses.<BR>10. Rain-And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the beautiful jewel of the album. Gorgeous ballad.<BR>11. Why's It So Hard-Wow. This song is great AND has a positive message.<BR>12. In This Life-And this is Madonna's personal side. This song is about Madonna's friends who died of AIDS.<BR>13. Did you do It-a remix of Waiting. This is the only track that is unnesessary.<BR>14. Secret Garden-WOW! Wonderful Jazzy little number. Very poetic.<BR>In short, with Erotica Madonna combines pop, house and dance with a touch of r+b/soul and a pinch of jazz. You need this album in your collection,Madonna fan or not! Good job M.
B00006690F|5.0|I deem this album to be a classic if not one of the best album I ever heard. To the casual observor, the album may seem albeit angry  cry for attention but it's actually a deeply personal tale of his trials and tribulation after the Marshall Mathers LP.  Thankfully, his passive aggresive ego and megolamanic attitude shines through the whole album which he should do more. I was  suprised at how well Eminem produced the majority of the tracks.  I'm convinced he spent sleepless night perfecting and editing these tracks especially \\"Hailie's Song\\" and \\"Sing For the Moment\\".  The DVD is a big plus, it should've cost [money] alone but good old lads at Interscope gave it to us for free. Purchase this album if it's the last thing you do.
0451528018|2.0|This was the first book I have ever read by Arthur Conan Doyle.  I would not recomend reading the book. I found it very dry and hard to read.  He uses textbook-like discription and his 1850's English language conflicts with the 2000's american language. The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story.  The book only starts to get some what interesting after that.  There wasn't much of a twist in the ending beyond telling you who was responible for the crime. Overall the book is not worth your time.

B00006690F|5.0|In Eminem's first cd, he talks about how nobody cares about him, how he's broke, about how bad his life is.  In the second one, he talks about how he's got all those things, but he's still not happy.  This cd seems to be a repeat of number two in terms of ideas, but the lyricism is once again amazing, and so this cd still stands.  Unfortunately, some of the beats are worse than the second cd, but it's hit and miss with them.  Overall, this cd is saved by Eminem's rapping itself, since the beats and the theme are both not so good.

B00005JKCF|5.0|Full disclosure: I have never read a Spider-Man comic book, and I avoid reading the daily Spider-Man strip because it annoys me having to feel sorry for a superhero! Here he is with all these wonderful powers, and he gets nothing from them but grief; he's a paragon of goodness, and almost everyone in the world thinks he's a diabolical criminal. I have real people and problems to worry about! Nevertheless, Sam Raimi's movie version of Spider-Man made Spidey and his alter ego, Peter Parker, seem more real to me than I ever imagined they would. The sheer craft of this movie is, of course, incredible; Raimi really makes you feel Peter's astonishment at discovering his new powers, as well as the breathtaking adrenaline rush of web-swinging between skyscrapers. But it is the casting which is this movie's ultimate triumph. Like everyone else, I was doubtful about the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter/Spidey. Among other things, however nerdy he might be, Peter has always been drawn in the comics as fashion-model handsome, which Maguire most definitely is not. But Maguire is such a pure, emotionally direct actor that he makes you love Peter and ache for him. Kirsten Dunst, perhaps the most talented actress of her generation, is equally lovable as MJ. Willem Dafoe does a brilliant job of playing the Jekyll-Hyde aspects of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin; Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are very moving as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May; and J.K. Simmons (in the absence of Jason Robards) makes a hilarious blowhard of J. Jonah Jameson. This unquestionably is the best superhero movie ever made. If you ever needed proof that, on the evolutionary scale, a spider is superior to a bat, here it is.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is one of those artists I usually doubt... Doubt that he can top what he has done in the past.  I was wrong.  This disc exceeds my expectations admirably.  It has a more \\"rock\\" feel to it (because Em produced most of it with Dre as exec. producer) but is firmly planted in the \\"hip hop\\" genre.  Eminem has matured without selling out OR losing his edge (a nearly impossible task in hip hop).<br />Along with Em's braggadocio comes a hint of self doubt: \\"If I was black I would have sold half\\" from *White America*. We see more sensitivity in *Hailie's Song* where Em discounts his own singing abilities (only to prove himself wrong). It's a love song that has nothing to do with the bedroom... that in itself is a first in hip hop.<br />The first single *Without Me* is excruciatingly funny, and addictively head-nodding.  Em again shows his sensitivity when he admits that his image (Slim Shady) sometimes overshadows the person (Marshall Mathers).  Alas, Eminem is a human... not a musical fraud like many of the rappers out there today \\"bling-blingin\\".   <br />*Sing For The Moment* is an interesting mix of Em and Aerosmith's *Dream On* which I doubted would work... only to be proved wrong again.  Joe Perry actually appears along side the sample to perform a guitar solo... no comment on that.<br />Overall, this is a very impressive disc and Eminem's flow is better than ever.  The introspection and sensitivity is a welcome change to the stale state of today's testosterone riddled hip-hop.  Eminem has already proved he is one of the best rappers in the industry, and now his writing and production skills are solidifying his position as a great entertainer.
6305327084|4.0|nothing in particular about this movie stands out to me, i just like it.  it stays entertaining every time i watch it.
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento was one of the most talked-about movies in the year it was released.  That was how it got popular - people talked about how good it was - not from excessive hype.  That is a decent measure of the quality of a film - not box office takings.  Memento was made on a shoestring budget.  It is fortunate that the creators were able to release a limited edition.  The additional features are well worth the extra amount.
B00000DC10|5.0|This is the most revolutionary album I have ever heard and will probably ever hear.
B0000027RL|5.0|Here it is, pearl jams imfamouse debute album ten, with all the classics on here, wether it be jeremy, even flow, alive etc. All in all there is not one bad song on here, not one witch I pretty rare with alot of bands to make such a solid album, and seemingly raw. The only album that pearl jam did that comes close to ten is vs. For some reason the following albums after vs seem to lack focus, but that's a predicament ill get to in the futre. Basicly every pearl jam album has it's share of gems, but this one is deninetly an expetion. So lets just get to the album. Ten starts off with the tunes once,even flow,alive,why go with it's really cool drum beat and black. With there high energy and wasome guitar playing. Then you get into the later half with songs like jeremy (that seemd to almost have this preminition about the school shootings years before they were to happen), oceans, porch, garden, deep, and release. Any fan of rock in genral, I would definetly buy this.
0553208845|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful books ever written; I couldn't put it down. This story follows the life of Siddhartha, the son of a respected Brahmin, who later becomes a Samana in hopes of finding his destiny; his perminent faith. He eventually realizes that locking himself into one religion will not bring him to happiness; to Utopia. Siddhartha has been the student of many teachers, and at first he believed in their teachings, but as he grew, as he discovered himself, he wanted to throw all of these false truths away (and succeeded after a long battle). He had always tried looking for the answers in other people; people he thought to be more wiser than him. But they were not wiser, more experienced, but not wiser. So Siddhartha sets out on his life's journey with one goal: to find Siddhartha. He meets Kamala (a beautiful courtesan) who teaches him of love and of giving. He is ward to Kamaswami, who teaches him business and profit and power, but the real Siddhartha only becomes more hidden; is only supressed deeper. Siddhartha becomes a rich man, with rich clothes and rich ways and rich speech, but he has forgotten simplicity and the beauty it posesses. He realizes what a fool he was to have that goal, that goal to find Siddhartha. Siddhartha was within him from the beginning, he was just looking too hard. He now has to look no more, he has already found himself, through all his foolish ways, his ascetism, his former wealth. Siddhartha is reborn.

0767819462|5.0|I always have and always will consider this a very meaningful and worthwhile movie. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were outstanding choices for the lead roles because they truly knew how to fit the types of characters they were playing. Susan Sarandon is Jackie Harrison, a highly devoted mother who is an outstanding example of a woman who loves and places her children above herself. Her ex-husband Luke (Ed Harris) finds a new love, Isabel (Julia Roberts). The whole situation is difficult for Jackie and both of her young children, especially her 12-year-old daughter Anna, who resents Isabel. When Susan is diagnosed with fatal cancer, it becomes absolutely necessary for the two kids to learn to accept Isabel. Many, many hardships and challenges rise between Susan and Isabel before they are finally able to put aside their differences, become friends, and figure out how to handle the future of their family--a future that they can no longer deny. I especially liked this movie because it deals with such serious and complex issues that many of us can at least appreciate if we have not experienced it ourselves. You really feel the tone of the issue through Anna, Susan's oldest child. She is such a horrible brat, you want to kick her, but then you soften when you realize that she is just scared and upset because she loves both of her parents, and it is hard for her to get through all of the changes. Any of us can understand or even relate to that. Although I enjoyed most aspects of this movie, I really loved the way Susan taught her children not to be afraid of her death, especially her very young son. There's no greater way to show your love for your child than by putting on a brave face during the scariest moment of your life in order to spare them the fear that you feel yourself. It truly is touching the way Susan loves her kids so selflessly in this movie. It's very deep, very moving, and worth the money to buy. I hope this review was helpful.
B0000668IF|5.0|A lot of reviews have said that this CD could be called rePlay for the similarities that it has shared with Play.  While the eclecticness of the songs are the same, the general tone is much more sombre and calmer (with the exception of Jam for the Ladies and perhaps Extreme Ways).  This CD is constantly in my CD player and i've even burned it on my comp so i don't have to keep moving the CD from my personal player to the comp.  I scratched the CD yesterday and now the last four tracks skip.  even though it is burned onto my hardrive, i still have to go out and get another copy.  it's that good!!!
0064400557|5.0|As we all know, there are those certain books in the world that literally every single child in the world should read, and \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is a perfect example of must-read literature. It's such a classic story, not to mention a beautiful one. E.B. White creates such memorable characters and describes them very well. When a little girl named Fern hears that some baby pigs have been born in the barn, she is terrified to hear that her father plans to kill the littlest one, the useless \\"runt.\\" Fern talks her father into letting her adopt the pig. She names it Wilbur and treats it as her own. Then the time comes for the pig to be more on its own, so Fern is forced to sell him to her uncle, who owns a farm. Wilbur feels lonely and out of place until he meets Charlotte, a kind spider who befriends him and, eventually, saves his life. Beautiful, beautiful story of friendship and courage. It contains characters and a fun plot that any child can enjoy. I read this book for the first time when I was in fourth grade, and I recently helped a little second-grader that I baby-sit for with her \\"Charlotte's Web\\" comprehension questions. It brought memories back. This is one of those books that you remember for the rest of your life once you've read it. It's excellent, and well worth the money.

B00004T9UF|5.0|THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP is very disturbing.  Eminem has gone crazy as he threatens to KILL KIM!  I liked it because Slim Shady really went mad wishing he would DIE or GET FIRED...<br />Track 11 Marshall Mathers is a very weird song where Eminem complains \\"I DON'T KNOW WHY ALL THE FUSS ABOUT ME\\"?  People are treating him different now compared to before he got famous.  Inspired by this song I wrote my own version of it explaing how people treat me different too...
6304211740|2.0|Let me start off by saying that this movie production of Jane Eyre bares little resemblance to the classic novel by Charlotte Bronte. The beginning is rather slow in comparison to the rest of the movie, while the end is needlessly rushed. It's almost as if Mr Zeffirelli began making the movie with extreme gusto and then got fed up of it halfway through and decided to finish the project hurriedly, which is a pity because Jane Eyre is a wonderful piece of literature and certainly does not deserve such carelessness.<br />Now on to the main problems with this movie. Firstly, although Charlotte Gainsbourg makes a competent Jane, she lacks the maturity of the Jane in the novel. Perhaps this is because Zeffirelli did not really show her as a protagonist - we don't get to see things from her point of view all that much, and sometimes the other characters overshadow her. Also, her expression rarely changes throughout the whole movie (she always looks like she has her teeth clenched), which is quite a drawback because Jane is supposed to have a lot of emotion in her, even though she looks plain and grey on the outside. This vital trait of Jane is something that Gainsbourg unfortunately failed to bring out.<br />Rochester is by far the biggest mistake in this movie. If you are a true admirer of the novel, I suggest you avoid watching this movie, solely for the fact that the Rochester of the book has been completely and utterly destroyed in the movie. Most readers would agree on what Rochester should look like: tall, dark and almost gruff, yet somewhat attractive. Here, Rochester has been transformed into a lilly-livered, waterey-eyed blond zombie who bears absolutely no similarity at all to the Rochester of the book! Sacrilege! This was without a doubt the *biggest* disappointment of the movie for me. He almost looks clownish when he falls off his horse in his opening scene!<br />While I'm at it, another character which has been completely ruined is Blanche Ingram. In essence,she is supposed to be elegant, dark-haired, slightly dark-skinned and somewhat arrogant, but still with a lot of flair and beauty, i.e. an absolute contrast to plain Jane. I certainly wasn't expecting to see a somewhat quiet, blonde, boring Blanche with her hair in two bunches! Although she is one of the less important characters, the contrast between her and Jane is important and should be brought out. Sadly I did not see that here. <br />Apart from the bad casting, as I mentioned earlier the beginning is slow while the end is rushed. There is hardly any balance in this production. Zeffirelli did Jane's childhood rather well, with Reed House and Lowood School being quite similar to the way most readers would imagine them. However, after the point where Jane leaves Thornfield, Zeffirelli clearly did not care to finish the movie properly: Jane suddenly wakes up in the Rivers household (totally out of the blue), learns that she has inherited a large sum of money, learns that the Rivers are her cousins, finds out that Thornfield has been burnt down, hears Rochester calling her name, goes to him, marries him and there's the happy ending! Blink and you'll miss it.<br />Well, in Zeffirelli's defence, Jane Eyre *is* quite a long book and is more suited to be made into a mini-series rather than a movie. But still, I was rather disappointed by this production of the novel. I strongly advise true fans of the book *not* to watch this movie. I can confidently say that you will be disappointed too.
B00005QZWI|2.0|The Lord of the Rings soundtrack has been call enchanting by critics and fans alike.  But if you want to call it enchanting, at least in my opinion, its only spell is a sleeping one.<br />I was shocked when Peter Jackson's team approached Howard Shore and not John Williams.  Williams is a masterful composer behind the finest work of the finest motion pictures of all time.  His work holds a certain magic within it. Star Wars, ET, Jurassic Park, Jaws, Indiana Jones. These were great film scores.<br />Unfortunately I cannot say the same for Shore's Lord of the Rings.<br />Howard Shore's work simply does not fall into the same field as John William's. His work his dry, there is no melody that you may find yourself humming days later as is the case with Indiana Jones and Star Wars. <br />Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was a great movie, but its soundtrack, in my opinion anyway, simply wasn't. If you buy the CD, take a good look at the cover because if you ever listen to it a second time, you'll more than likely have to wipe off a layer of dust that's covering it with all your other old CDs you listened to once and then never again.<br />I bought the Lord of the Rings soundtrack expecting a score that matched the epic scale of the motion picture it accompanied, unfortunately, what I recieved was a jumbled mess of tracks with no shared melody of a dark and dreary tone.<br />I gave it a two because in comparison with some of the other soundtracks of recent years it is analogous, but I was expecting something far more from such a fine movie.  <br />Howard Shore took home an Oscar for the music contained within this CD, beating John Williams - twice. And yet I simply do not find any of the tracks in this CD to be worth the money - or the time!<br />P.S. If you do buy the CD do not put it into your computer, it pops up with a multitude of ads, including one for the product itself, that froze my reasonably fast computer.
B000003BEV|4.0|'Their Satanic Majesties Request is, by far, the most underrated effort in the Rolling Stones' career. It's also their second and, thankfuly, last attempt at psychedelia. It's quite plain from listening to it that it was never the Stones' field of expertise, and it couldn't have been interesting for much longer, but as far as it went their psychedelic period bared some excellent fruit; the album is certainlty not a Stones essential or a psychedelic essential, but it's a great, beautiful, very fun album and, if nothing else, a good laugh and a nice curiosity.<br />The album's main problem is that the Stones had no experience in doing this kind of music, they didn't know how to approach it and, most importantly, they don't really seem to have had much fun doing it. They did their best to enjoy themselelves, but all too often it sounds fake and strained. The most obvious example is 'Sing This All Together (See What Happens)', a bloody awful, pretentious, pointless, too long psychedelic instrumental. 'The Lantern' and 'Gomper are also very weak.<br />The album, though, has many fine moments: First and foremost, the spectacular 'She's A Rainbow', an excellent song with superb instrumental work, and the album's only hit single. Other highlights are - 'Sing This All Together', a very cheerful 60s anthem in the style of 'All You Need Is Love'; '2000 Light Years From Home', a very nice piece of space-rock; 'Citadel', an excellent, straightforward Keith Richards heavy rocker with a very catchy riff; and 'In Another Land', a lovely, very Syd Barrett-like psychedelic song, bass player Bill Wyman's debut as a songwriter.<br />'Their Satanic Majesties Request' was inevitable. It's populr to consider it a trendy copy of the Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper', a faint attempt by the Stones to meet popular demand, but that's only half true. Listening to previous Stones albums it's hard to deny that 'Satanic Majesties' is a very direct continuation of their recordings in recent years (e.g. 'RubyTuesday'). In 'Their Satanic Majesties Request' the Stones reached the logical end of the direction they were taking, and they were now free to find a new one. Indeed, by their next album the Stones found their new sound which would dominate their finest works. 'Satanic Majesties' is not essential, but it shouldn't be ignored. Every complete Stones collection should have it, and it's guaranteed to be lots of fun if you approach it with an open mind.
B000021XS0|5.0|Ok. <BR>This CD goes on for 78 minutes.Every second on it counts! The 12 tracks are really a big one song divided into scenes(from the past and the present).All is being done in order for a story to be presented. Astiry that really is not ver yet, but its continiously evolving(confused? don't worry , you will finally get it). Its not a regular speed metal dream theater album. ITS ART! <BR>When they first told me about this cd, :\\"that a progressive rock group tries to tell a story with their music\\" , I  said no thanks, it really must be a confusing piece of [music]. A bunch of quys trying to be creative.  WRONG!!!!<BR>From they day I got it ( 1 month )I CANT listen anything else!!! There are wonderful tracks on it , and the story ( which will definatelly amaze you ) is told in a beutiful way. I had to listen to the CD about 4 to 5 times to really understand what happened (it cocerns a death and reincarnation but you really must LISTEN , to get the message). <BR>On this album, melody, speed metal and classic music co-exist. Dream Theater its their name, and with this CD they really made me construct a whole theater play in my mind. Simply wonderful. You wont regret it . Buy this CD and place it in a special place from al the others. <BR>A masterpiece !
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is one of the best movies I've seen in many years, even though I'm still trying to figure out what actually happened in this 2.5 hour movie.  Unlike most films that operate on logic, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; works on the emotions.  If you want a mystery that &quot;ties everything together,&quot; then this isn't the movie for you.<br />The plot involves a brunette who, having just survived a car accident, staggers through the streets of LA, apparently not remembering her name or the accident.  She stumbles her way into a posh home, where she befriends a perky blonde, who just flown from Canada to launch an acting career.  Together, they try to discover the brunette's identity.<br />Meanwhile, a young hotshot director is being manipulated by members of the mob, who insist they have a say as to who should be cast as leading lady in his film.  This subplot, I guess, is Lynch's commentary on Hollywood and the often dubious politics that go on during movie-making.<br />Despie the movie's incoherence, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is absolutely fascinating to watch.  Everything, from the camerawork to Angelo Badalamenti's seductive score to Naomi Watts's award-calibre performance, grabs hold of your attention and refuses to let go.  But just when you THINK you've understood the movie, the film's final third takes a dramatic, unexpected turn.  I won't reveal what it is, but it will certainly throw you in for a loop.<br />The DVD itself has a great 5.1 soundtrack and a crisp and vivid picture.  However, all we get for features are the trailer and &quot;10 clues.&quot;  What's really frustrating, though, is that the film has only ONE chapter: the movie itself!  That's right, you can't go from scene to scene in this film without hitting your fast-forward button.  Despite that inconveience, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is an intriguing, mind-bending thriller from one of America's most independent, uncompromising filmmakers.

630281474X|5.0|Jonathan Harker travels to see Dracula (assumed to be in Transylvania), knowing he is a vampire; Jonathan has come to destroy him. Dracula gets Jonathan first and then claims Mina and Miss Lucy (Jonathan fiancée) as his. Dr. Van Helsing (played by Peter Cushing) appears; he was a friend of Jonathan's, and an expert in vampirisms. The rest of the movie we see Van Helsing hunting down Dracula and in the end we see Dracula reduced to dust.<br />It is interesting to note that Christopher Lee returns to his Dracula role in Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1965) and is revived from that dust. Christopher Lee refused to play Dracula for almost 10 years, because he was afraid of being stereotyped.<br />In this movie, we probably see one of the most famous duos in horror film history. I am a huge fan of both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and have enjoyed all of their movies, especially the old Universal remakes (e.g., Horror of Dracula (1958), The Curse of Frankenstein (1958), The Mummy (1959)).

B00003CXI0|5.0|First off, I loved this movie!!!!!! I am a huge harry fan and read them all the time. (anxiously awaiting book five!) And I would also like to state, I am a Christian. That's right, a  13 year old christian who reads harry potter. And those christians that haven't seen this movie, or even worse, haven't read the books, get over yourself!!! This book is not based mostly on witchcraft but the war between good and evil where good dominates all. And a true harry potter lover would not care if this was a good movie or not because they would just want their story to come to life!!! Well, all i say is buy this delicious movie that will make you watch again and again!!!
B00005ATQF|1.0|The first time I saw this film in the theater I completely enjoyed it and would have given it 4 or 5 stars easily.  Too bad only half the film gets released on this DVD; its like watching a movie through a keyhole.  I would like to give this release 0 stars for not including a letterbox version for those of us who actually want to see the movies we buy.  No letterbox -- no sale!
B000002HO3|5.0|Most people know Simply Red for their #1 ballads, &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot; and &quot;If You Don't Know Me By Now.&quot;  However, as this CD shows, they are so much more than that.  Every one of their albums has many instances of fantastic white boy soul.  Some of the most achingly beautiful songs ever are found here, such as &quot;Stars,&quot; &quot;For Your Babies&quot; and &quot;So Beautiful.&quot;  Add to that an amazing cover of Aretha Franklin's &quot;Angel&quot; and you have a one stop shop for soul greatness.  If you liked Simply Red's hits, you'll like this.
B00003CXI1|4.0|There is really only one reason I didn't give this film 5 stars: the fast pace of the movie. It jumped around too much. I did like everything else though. I loved the quidditch scene, ( EVEN THOUGH BILL MURPHY SAYS IT WAS A SNOOZE-FEST) it was great. Sorry Bill Murphy but sometimes things aren't always how YOU pictured them, or how some Dale so-n-so tells it. Maybe You guys are wrong and, hey, everyone else on earth is right. <br />Anyway, my being a fan of Harry Potter has in no way hindered my review. It was a good movie. Not great, but good. It told the story of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone and cut out nothing that is important. (Sorry, but Peeves wasn't that important). I was very pleased to see that they left the snake scene in because it has importance to the next film. <br />All in all, good film, do not hesitate to buy it (Cause it's gonna go fast) and enjoy it. I heard there are lots of special features, so if the movie doesn't satisfy you, just play around a bit. <br />Buy it.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Don't teenagers make a big production about everything?  Since this album is written about and for teens, doesn't it make sense to take the production way over the edge?  Undoubtedly yes.  As close to Broadway as some teens will ever get, this album still sounds like a champ.  There is real feeling in the ballads \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\" and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" (these songs are ripe for covering by other artists).  Of course, nobody could cover \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" and get away with it, but that song is one of a kind.  Incidentally fellas, if you can find a woman who can karaoke with you to this song, marry her!  She's obviously got class!!!
B00003CX95|4.0|This film really had me at sixes and sevens as to how to review it.  On the one hand, I study medieval history.  On that standard the film would rate zero stars.  On the other hand, this is truly fine cinema.  So I will go with the latter over the former.<br />Let's start with the bad.  This film has nothing to do with history.  When I say \\"nothing\\" I mean that there are some correct names but that is about it.  William Wallace was the son of a Lowland knight.  He never besieged York, much less took it.  The princess the film suggests he had an affair with was about 8 years old at the time of Wallace's death.  His death was not a public ceremony and execution.  There were no flaming bogs.  No one painted their faces blue -- PERIOD!  Most of the clothing styles shown are from a couple hundred years later.  Robert the Bruce never fought with the English.  I could keep going.  The point here is that you have to assume that the film takes place in a parallel dimension where there happens to be a country called Scotland, there happens to be another country called England, there happens to be a man named William Wallace and he fights against the country of England.  <br />In other words, don't try to take this for reality in the slightest.<br />Conversely, this is a whopping great bit of cinematic grandeur!<br />Gibson brings real conviction to his role.  So does Patrick McGoohan (there is an enemy truly worthy of loathing!).  One of the marvelous touches of this film is that every time you are back in Scotland you see sweeping panoramas of the land -- the feeling is a true love of country.  When the action switches back to the English, you are inside of castles or rancid small towns.  Gibson/Wallace if fighting for a land; Edward/McGoohan is fighting for power.  Even the cinematography makes this obvious.<br />The battle scenes are gruesome, gutwrenching, and truly awe-inspiring.  No one just clutches his chest and dies here -- be forewarned, the battle scenes were onlyone-upped in their gruesome reality by \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  These are not scenes for the squeamish.  On the other hand even this pounds home the notion that the Scots are fighting FOR something -- under-equipped, undermanned, they are willing to fight toe-to-toe with their enemy as long as their are led by someone with conviction.  Gibson's Wallace gives that conviction.  \\"Where are you going?\\"  \\"I'm going to start a war.\\"<br />This is a film that drags you in and keeps you hooked.  You care about the good guys.  You care about the bad guys, too, but in a very different way (\\"Hmmm, if I could do something vicious to Edward I, what would I do?\\").  This is a film of high drama and a few other the top performances (like that mad little Irishman).  If you like sweeping action films like \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", this film will draw you in.  History it is not; grand cinema it is.
B00005YU1O|4.0|The main purpose of me writing this review is I hope to maybe say something that I didn't really know I knew.  That may just be possible because that's almost one of the underlying messages of the movie.  Have you ever had a dream, then awoke, and realized that some of the things people said to you were really profound, but then realized that it all must have come out of your own head, because it was your dream?  This is defiantly a movie for two types of people; Animation buffs who will simply go ga-ga over the interesting techniques and symbols which are spattered throughout the canvas of this film, and two modern day philosophers who are obsessed with the continuum of the dream realm.  In my opinion no indi-film is flawless.  There were instances where I would start to wonder, and think about other things.  But that seems to be what the movie is trying to get the audience to do.  My favorite part of the movie is the broad spectrum of people who are submitting their thoughts on the subject at hand.  I am sure everybody will have a favorite character, and everybody will have a least favorite character, but i am also sure that very few people will have the same ides on which those characters are.  I feel this is a great movie to watch alone with a notepad, and should be used as a jumpstart for the creative mind.
B00006690F|4.0|\\"Guess who's back, back again. Shady's back, tell a friend.\\" That is how the hit song Without Me by Eminem starts and it is very true. Shady is back, but this time he has decided that he has more important things on his mind than just dissin other rappers and causing mischief (although there is still some of that). This album is a lot more politically minded speaking up for the youth of America in a way that no one has had the guts to before.<br />Fans of his last 2 albums may not like this one as much. Other than the radio hit \\"Without Me\\", this album is alot slower and darker, filled with slow beats and lyrics to make you think. Their aren't as many goffy songs like on the \\"Slim Shady LP\\" or \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\", but I think that the quality of the songs and of the lyrics have actually gone up.<br />People will call this album a failure and a horrible return, but let's face it, nothing could live up to the hype that this album has generated. This will not sell as many copies as the last disc and it won't be nominated for \\"Album of the year\\" grammy, but this CD is still a quality piece of work. <br />Recomended, but prepare to open you mind to a new style of Eminem.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Akira is without a doubt one of the all time greatest anime's ever created, and I admit I was skeptical when I heard about this &quot;new version&quot; (the original version of Akira was the second anime I ever saw, the first was Vampire Hunter D).  First off, I will say that the animation is still superb, especially now that the picture has been remastered; the Blade Runner-esque city and buildings jump off the screen, and you will notice more detail than you did in the original version.  However, the new dubbing job doesn't completely fix the convulted plot (it does a bit though), and the ending still leaves something to be desired.  Also, the new voice actors don't quite fit with the characters the way the original voice actors did in the original film.  Kanada sounds like a little kid, and Tetsuo sounds no more menacing than he did in the original, but aside from those gripes everything is perfect.  Do yourself a favor, if you love great anime like Vampire Hunter D or Wicked City, pick up Akira, it is an all time landmark in anime, and now has never been a better time to purchase it.
B00005JKEC|2.0|Interesting moral dilemma.<br />About the first half way through the movie, the premise was bright.  A moral story.  A rookie who spends a day training with his new boss narcotics agent discovers that the ways that his boss roots out evil aren't exactly... godly.  This reminded me of Boiler Room, because in both movies the \\"rookie\\" is forced to make a decision between the morality he has and what is being presented to him as moral.  I've never seen Denzel Washington use such foul language.  But in the second half, it just fell flat on it's face.  - NO SPOILERS, don't worry. - It looked as if Warner Brothers had forced Village Roadshow pictures to slap on the ending that they did because the moral fable just wasn't enough - that W.B. wanted it to appeal to lower brow audience, perhaps.  Maybe that's why there is such unnecessary violence throughout the movie.  In fact, the ending - no spoilers included - stylized as to look dramatic, but really it is just low-brow.  Should've been an independent movie without the financial backing from WB as WB messed it up.
B000063UR2|5.0|Ridley Scott's much maligned fantasy adventure finally makes it to DVD in a beautifully packaged, lavish two disc set that features a glorious director's cut that's almost 25 minutes longer than the original U.S. theatrical release of 17 years ago. The fleshing out of character and story in this classic beauty and the beast, good and evil, light and darkness fable certainly fills in the gaps and makes this wondrous tale a substantially nuanced and more emotionally satisfying experience.<br />Tom Cruise is Jack, a mythical forest dweller whom fate has chosen to battle a demonic lord of darkness (Tim Curry) to save a princess (Mia Sara).  Director Scott claims this restored version -- including Jerry Goldsmith's mystical score -- is the film he originally wanted to make.<br />In his richly detailed and entertaining commentary, he covers a myriad of production concerns and makes note that all the amazing sets and effects were essentially filmed as we see them in real time and not the result of computer graphics or optical tricks. Hard to believe the huge forest sets were built to order inside a gigantic sound stage.  They are even more surreal and dreamlike in this perfect widescreen transfer.<br />There's a wealth of extras including the original version, isolated original release score by Tangerine Dream, lost scenes, storyboards, recreation (with photos and drawings and music) of discarded scenes, Brian Ferry's music video \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" and much, much more.  This striking film deserves rediscovery and Universal has spared no expense in creating a terrific digital edition of what is now clearly a masterpiece of epic fantasy that was only hinted at in its original release.  Special note should be made of the remarkably visual original screenplay by William Hjortsberg who also wrote the novel \\"Fallen Angel\\" that became the underrated film \\"Angel Heart.\\"  Another story about confronting Satan.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Even though I am a BIG fan of Ewan McGregor, I was scared to rent this movie. I guess because I didn't know what to expect. I knew or actually heard of how different this movie was. However, I did rent this movie not too long ago and Ewan McGregor steals the movie.<br />The movie centers around this young wanna-be writer, Christian (McGregor) and he recounts his life at the Moulin Rouge and his love for Satine (Nicole Kidman). My favorite part of the movie is the \\"Elephant Love Medley\\". I played that scene over and over again, because I love McGregor's singing. Don't worry, I'm not forgetting Nicole Kidman...I was surprised by her voice. Even Kidman is good in this movie, this movie is ALL Ewan McGregor. He is SO GOOD in this movie, it's hard to describe. From the beginning to the end, he shows such emotion. I have never seen him act THIS good in a movie before. This is one of his finest performances I have ever seen. Kidman's performance is also so very strong. They have such good chemistry...I hope to see them together in a movie again. McGregor was stripped of a Golden Globe he was so rightly nominated for and Kidman definitely earned her Golden Globe win!!!!<br />The thing about this movie is that it does start off crazy in the first 15-20 minutes, but then it goes to an unexpected storyline that I didn't expect. It is something different, but don't be afraid of it. Yes, it's a musical, but if it wasn't for the music, the movie wouldn't really make sense if there wasn't the singing.<br />Even though I've gloated about McGregor's performance, the whole CAST is great!!!!!<br />The story itself is very good and I had no idea what the story was and I certainly didn't expect the ending, there are some slow, boring scenes like the \\"Like a Virgin\\" music number. I could've done without that.<br />All in all, it's a good movie with AWESOME performances by Nicole Kidman and especially by Ewan McGregor.
B00005N90N|5.0|This video was filmed on November 27th and 28th 1988 at the two sold-out concerts of Iron Maiden at Birmingham's N.E.C.,England.The concerts were part of the extensive worldwide tour,'Seventh Tour Of A Seventh Tour',which also included Maiden's headliling at the 'Monsters Of Rock' festival in Donington park,England.The video was Dirested and Edited by Maiden's bassist Steve Harris and came out in 1989,but also in 1994 in Double Pack-CD &amp; Video.The whole tour had great succses with their second UK number one album,'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son'.The set-list included some classics that Maiden hadn't play live the recent tours,like Still Life,THE PRISONER and, oh yes, KILLERS with Bruce's magnificent vocals.This was the last perfect Maiden gig in the 80s.Many people think that Bruce hadn't sang that well on a Maiden gig since 'Maiden England',but the new live album 'Rock In Rio' is just a proof  that Bruce can sing better than on 'Maiden England' and even 'Live After Death'.
B00005QDW1|1.0|To start off, let me clear this up. I LOVE No Doubt. I think the whole band (not just Gwen Stefani) is extremely talented. But along with many other once devoted Gwen fans, I'm doubting No Doubt. Their first album, No Doubt, was a great start off. Their second album, The Beacon Street Collection, is one of those incredible CD's that I can listen to forever. It's in my CD player entirely too often. Then comes Tragic Kingdom which, although it is an incredibly hyped album, rocks. With Return of Saturn, they started to fall away from their ska roots, but not entirely. They were still on top of all their lyrics. But with Rock Steady, all hell broke loose. They have an intro (which, although their first album had an intro, most good albums do not have intros), they have totally lost their ska roots, their lyrics are not particularly creative, and the songs all sound almost exactly alike. I suppose that if No Doubt went back, they could pick up with where they left off after Tragic Kingdom, but I doubt that they will. Pretty soon, all we'll have left are pictures and three good albums because I have a feeling that Gwen will even lose her great sense of style.

0380778556|3.0|This is a novel of mystery as well as intrigue.  It is exceptionally written and an alluring read.  The narrator, young and naive sets out to a new life she could only dream of.  She is recently married to the rich and secretive Maxim de Winter, who owns the Manderly mansion. His former life plagues her and reveals horrific details of Maxim's past. Rebecca, Maxim's late wife, whose shadow the narrator walks in, becomes the one person who can shatter her newly found happiness.  Rebecca's death still holds mystery but the truth has its ways of being known.  I thought the book to be thrilling and compelling, keeping you at the edge of your seat with each turn of the page.  The language is very descriptive and almost poetic.  Each character, setting and element significant to the novel is vividly portrayed through her eloquent writings.  This novel truly is a joy to read due to the puzzling plot which keeps the reader guessing right up to the very end.
B00006312Q|4.0|The song is great. No denying that, inspirational, captivating, vulnerable yet full of hope at the same time. There is one major problem with this single though. A rather tragic tracklisting. Please let me explain. Here is how is goes:<BR>1. A New Day Has Come (Ric Wake Radio Remix) 4.23 - Also featured on Celine's latest album of the same title, it sits pretty at track #5. This is the version of the song you hear on the radio. It's the inspirational uplifting poppy version.<br />2. A New Day Has Come (Humberto Gattica Album Edit) 4.30 - Just an edit of the orginal album version which comes in at 5 minutes and 41 seconds. I strongly believe this edit is unnecessary and the single could have been well off with the whole album version on it instead of just an edit because the song is just not quite complete.<br />3. Prayer (Album Version) - warning people, this song is not the collaboration with Andrea Bocelli. This is a new track also featured on Celine's latest release. It's an inspirational ballad which features sweet backing vocals from a choir of children.<br />4. A New Day Has Come (Christian B Remix) 3.54 - This track is another that is deemed unnecessary. It's almost identical to the Ric Wake Radio Remix. What was this dude thinking? It's only missing a few beats and that's about it, and a tad shorter of course. <br />So technically speaking, you are buying approximately 2 and a half songs. Track 4 is unnecessary, track 2 is incomplete because it's been edited down and you can tell that it is kind of missing an ending. But yeah, track 1 and 3 are well worth the money though. Check this out if you're hesitant about the album, if not, then I'd suggest you get the album instead because purchasing this single is just like a three track album sampler.
B00005QDW5|1.0|Do not be fooled by this collection of unbalanced and unfocused hits(?), best of (?) Anthology (?). This has the focus of those old TV record collections. I don't know what this mess is. I recomend that you log on to Madster and get it for what it is worth. Sad release from an otherwise exquisit outfit.
B00004R99K|5.0|The story of the animated film is similar to that of the first book, but contains parts of the second book. Dozy Alice is so silly she follows trouble by chasing a talking rabbit down hs hole. At the bottom, she drinks an unknown substance which helps her get through a talking door into Wonderland. Here she meets the Dodo, TweedleDum and TweedleDee (who tell her the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter), the Talking flowers (watch out for the snobby Iris!), the Caterpillar and the Cheshire Cat. She even has un-birthday tea with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. However, Alice gets caught up in a game of croquet with the Queen of Hearts, and later a trial. The whole thing becomes such a nightmare, Alice realises she's had a dream while she dozed off.<br />Firstly, I don't know why loads of people think this film is cheesy. I know Alice isn't for everyone, but when you look at the other films made based on Children's classics by Disney (eg- Jungle Book, Hunchback of Notre Dame), you'll see it's more faithful than those films to the original. However if you have read the books and haven't seen this film, some characters are missing (eg- Duchess, Mock Turtle, Knave of Hearts, White Knight). This may just think that Disney has ruined this classic forever. They haven't. It's the best adaption I've ever seen.<br />Although I actually have the PAL version, I suppose the movie is just the same over in North America. The best bits are the Walrus and the Carpenter, the garden of singing flowers and flamingo croquet. And the Mad Tea Party is still the funniest part of a Disney classic. So buy this movie. Wether it's a video tape or DVD.<br />(I also live near Carroll's birth place!)
B00005YU1O|1.0|Along with some of the other dissatisfied reviewers, I've enjoyed the style and originality of Linkletter's previous films. Visually, the film is stunning and perhaps even a landmark of sorts. Content wise, it doesn't even merit a B-minus from a college level film making class. This is a tortuous and meandering death march of stoner philosophy and pretentious intellectual hogwash. Even the phenomenal visuals can't remotely resurrect this irritating montage of tired cliches.
B00005QIPH|3.0|no doubts about it, this album is tightly wound around simple song structures. and thats a good thing, simplicity always becomes underrated. The Strokes offer their funkless brand of rock under the guise of nostalgia. and it works. one of my friends guffawed at the playing, \\"i could play better.\\" that may be true to a certain extent, but i frown on the idea that music, to be serious, has to have unplayable difficulty. simple, stripped and sparse can offer great rewards as well. <br />having defended that, i must add that although the vocals were charming, the instruments were dull. i felt no excitement or rush from the guitars or drumming. everything was straightforward but blandly standard. there was no freakout - aside from a couple vocal quirks (Modern Age comes to mind). nothing suggested character or declared itself. weirdly enough it seemed afraid. <br />so the question seems to be, what will they do next? i don't think they can pull this same stuff off again - i can and could be wrong - they're young, have time to grow or fade away.
0738206679|5.0|With so much buzz about Wolfram's book, great to see a book that DOES talk about NEW science. Barabasi, the top guy in the new science of networks, talks about what he knows best: complexity and networks, and how they affect our life. While an easy read, it is full of so many thought provoking ideas, that I'd read for a while and then have to put it down to reflect over the details of what I'd just read.  Gladwell's tipping point was an entertaining read, but light on true understanding. Linked makes up the difference:  it breaks new ground, offering the reader insight and research into the structure of networks in just about all fields and aspects of life. While Gladwell chats about connectors, people who are incredibly sociable and well-connected, Barabasi is the one who really gets to the heart of the matter. He discovered these connectors (he calls them hubs) while looking at the www (Yahoo and Google are some of those), and he shows that they are present in the cell, in the business world (Vernon Jordan), in sex (Wild Chamberlain), in Hollyood  (Kavin Bacon) and many other networks. These hubs are not accidents, but they appear in all networks as a simple rich gets richer process is responsible for them.<br />  If you REALLY want to grasp how ideas spread, how to stop AIDS, how to break down the Internet, how to use your neighbor's computer, how to make your website matter or how to became a board member in a big company, Linked is a good place to start. Barabasi breaks down a complex world into very simple, clear concepts. While I have read several books about 'new' science, this one is really about something new, exciting, and hard to forget. Highly recommend it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|although i had YHF downloaded, i bought the album. last night was the first time i was able to hear it. driving home around midnight it offered me dusky sentiments and chilling pop hooks. the quiet, at times, broken vocals caught me up, it was... working class. an album without pretension, and at times sparse (a good thing). ...this is a great album. the maturity and graceful sounds should not be looked down upon.
B000060P79|5.0|simple plan's cd &quot; no pads, no helmets, just balls &quot; is the kinda cd a typical teenager would want to hear. whether your into punk, rock, alternative.. the list goes on, you will love SP. This group tells it like it is, and they have an awesome way of doing it. We all can relate to what they are singing about and that in itself is a great quality for a band.
B00006690F|3.0|this album doesn't have the freshness or spunk of the last album, though a few of the tracks are very good.  White America is very cool.  So is Say Goodbye Hollywood and Square DAnce.   A few of the discs come with a DVD that has highlights of some live concerts (Japan), which have the best songs from the last CD.  After watching the DVD I was reminded why I liked The M.M. Album so much and why this one's not quite as good.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'd feel guilty and ungrateful if I didn't give YHF it's due praise on Amazon. Listen to this with an open mind, and you're in for one hell of a musical experience. Like all classic albums, it may not appeal to you the first time -- don't give up. This is a masterpiece, if you're willing to give it a chance.<br />Once you discover it for yourself, buy a few extra copies to give to friends. I've made several YHF converts already.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I didn't see it at the theater, so the first time I saw it was when I bought it on DVD.  As soon as it was over I watched it again.  The next day I watched it again.  And I watched it two more times that same week.  The first few times through the movie you will not really understand what's going on, but that's what draws you to it so much.  You're watching, the whole time seemingly random things are happening, but you know it's part of some bigger picture which you just cannot figure out, and that's what's so compelling about the movie.  Somebody mentioned how the characters do not talk like normal people, but I argue quite the opposite.  In the last half of the movie they very much do talk like normal people, and once you actually do figure out what the movie is about, it will make perfect sense why they don't talk like normal people in the first half of the movie.  In fact, once you figure it out EVERYTHING makes perfect sense.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor in this movie which you can only understand once you figure out what the movie is about.  For example, <br />Betty: It's kind of weird to be calling yourself.<BR>Rita: Maybe it's not me.<BR>&lt;ring, ring&gt;<BR>Answering Machine: Hi, it's me.<br />This part kills me every time I watch it.<br />I could go on for days about this movie but part of the fun of this movie comes from figuring out what is going on.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.  The only thing is that the first time you watch this movie you cannot watch _trying_ to figure it out.  Don't try to connect scenes together, and figure out literal meanings of things.  Just take it for what it is, a collection of scenes that seem to flow together nicely.  After you've watched it a few times, then try to figure out the movie.  The more you watch it the more you will notice the little hints that Lynch throws in there to try to tell you what the movie is about.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|2 of the most enjoyable hours I've spent watching a recent movie.  It's another great film by Mike Myers.  Laugh, cry all the good stuff and hilarious lines to boot.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I found the film \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" to be uneven, but ultimately very compelling and enjoyable. One of the best things about the film was its unbelievably diverse and daring musical soundtrack. The soundtrack CD, while incomplete, is superb. It's filled with excitement, palpable emotion, and great vocal and instrumental performances.<br />David Bowie opens the show on a somber note with \\"Nature Boy.\\" This leads into the outrageous urban funkiness of \\"Lady Marmalade,\\" performed with irresistible zest by the multicultural diva quartet of Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, and Pink. Also fun is Fatboy Slim's hyperactive \\"Because We Can.\\" Other great selections include the tender, world-weary voice of Rufus Wainwright on the melancholy \\"Complainte de la Butte,\\" and the freaky, beautiful \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\" (featuring Alka Yagnik).<br />But like the film, the CD really depends on the two leads: Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. They are outstanding. Kidman is fierce and sexy on \\"Sparkling Diamonds,\\" romantic and authoritative on \\"One Day I'll Fly Away.\\" McGregor is especially impressive on \\"Your Song\\" (featuring Alessandro Safina). Who would have thought that Obi-Wan Kenobi had such a fantastic singing voice? As excellent as Kidman is, I really think it is McGregor who gives both film and soundtrack their heart and soul.<br />When Kidman and McGregor come together on the \\"Elephant Love Medley,\\" the most potent magic of the whole CD really becomes evident. This medley of segments from a diverse bunch of songs (\\"All You Need Is Love,\\" \\"Don't Leave Me This Way,\\" \\"Silly Love Songs,\\" \\"I Will Always Love You,\\" etc., etc.), combined with dialogue, showcases the chemistry these two performers shared. The \\"Medley\\" is ultimately a soaring, triumphant, even inspirational tour de force of arrangement and performance.<br />Yes, I loved the \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" soundtrack. I rank it right up there with such classic song soundtracks as \\"Purple Rain\\" and \\"Saturday Night Fever.\\"
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira can't get a break.  People complain about her blonde hair and call her a sell-out, while others complain about the way she pronounces her English.  She's a very talented and pretty singer whether her hair is black, pink or blonde and her voice is lovely whether she's singing in Spanish, Portuguese or English.  <br />It should be obvious that before you even buy the CD, she's gonna have a strong accent, because...ENGLISH ISN'T HER FIRST LANGUAGE!!!  SHE'S FROM COLOMBIA, WHERE THEY SPEAK SPANISH!!!  IT'S ONLY NATURAL SHE WILL HAVE AN ACCENT, AND A STRONG ONE!!!...as far as the CD goes...it's muy, muy fabuloso!!!  That pretty much sums it up.
0783222955|5.0|This would be a wonderful film for parents to watch with children old enough to understand the depth of its message. Good and evil are clearly drawn, and the values of justice and humanity portrayed with rare and memorable strength.<br />Reading Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel had a huge impact on me as a teenager...I never forgot, as Atticus says to Scout, that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.<br />Horton Foote won an Oscar for his screenplay, which is so faithful to the book. Set in depression era Alabama, it's seen through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, beautifully played by Mary Badham, and the sensitivity of director Mulligan's vision is remarkable.<br />Prejudice is the theme that runs through the story, from the harrowing court case of Tom (an amazing performance by Brock Peters), falsely accused of rape, to the demonization of Boo  (played by Robert Duvall, in his screen debut...he's intensely moving as this innocent and silent man).<br />Russell Harlan's superb cinematography should be seen in the widescreen version to be fully appreciated, and Elmer Bernstein's Americana style score adds so much to the film.<br />Gregory Peck's Oscar winning performance is magnificent. His Atticus is a hero of immense proportions, with compassion, integrity, and humility...and it's one of the many reasons I think this powerful classic deserves to be in every video library.
B00006690G|5.0|Ok, haven't heard much from Eminem for a while besides on Court TV, right?... Well, it seems he hasn't fallen yet... first off the is the intro- nothing much but noises.. ok.. now we get into track 2, a strong beat.. strong lyrics that make sense.. this whole CD proves a fact he hasn't lost a beat or lyric in the troubles he's been having. Hailie's Song has to be my favorite.. it shows he has a soft side, with him singing, and rapping.. Marshall has definitely got it all back to him
B000002VTE|5.0|This album is the sound of frontman Jason Pierce falling apart, but in elegant and graceful style. 'All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away' he proclaims on the complex, interweaving opening title track. It's affecting, compelling and the scope is one of epic grandeur. Melding soul, rock, gospel, blues and classical, this album never fails to stun, never fails to move. It is now my fourth favorite album of all time. It is full of fabulous tracks, from the big, jazzy, brassy soul singalong 'Come Together' to 'All of My Thoughts' which shifts from grand organheavy indie to rambling over-excited blues every minute, to the string-laden heartbreaking beauty of 'Broken Heart' and the chillout anthems 'Stay With Me' and 'Cool Waves', the dirty rocker 'Electricity' and the epic 'I Think I'm In Love'. Unbeatable.
B00006690F|5.0|This is one of his best albums showing a new side of eminem the CD still has a regualar emeinem but also capturs a new side of him and he acutaly sings one of the songs an interesting version and side of eminem not seen befor and an old side we will never forget. His best yet great buy the dvd is also very good featuring a humores cartoon and live performances
B00006690F|4.0|Got \\"The Eminem Show\\" today and it's ish hot. White America is hot, Cleaning out my Closet has some grimey lyrics and When the Music Stops and My Dad's Gone Crazy are all big joints that'll make you drop your jaw in awe at this guy's lyrical genius and outrageousness...another big album from the white man's Dr Dre. Watch out Canibus, Em's comin' out swingin.
B0000636UN|3.0|I was hesitant to buy this album because I didn't like the single soak up the sun, nor did I hear good things about this album. However, I usually like her albums and I respect her as an artist. Since it was on sale, I figured &quot;why not?&quot; When I listened to it, I thought it was OK, nothing different than what she's done before: nothing ground breaking. Overall, I wasn't impressed. Here's how I rate the songs:<br />1. Steve McQeen : I love this song! It's one of the better ones on the album 5/5<br />2. Soak Up The Sun : I don't care for this song...i usually skip it. It's just a radio friendly piece of garbage...I know she can do better than this!(because she has..) 1/5<br />3. You're An Original : I like this song. (I wish I could hear Lenny more, though) 4/5<br />4. Safe And Sound : I'm bias on this one..I don't like ballads. However, even as far as ballads go, this is pretty boring and well, bad 1/5<br />5. C'mon C'mon : This song is OK. If Stevie Nicks wasn't featured in this song, it would be on the verge of not listenable. 2/5<br />6. It's So Easy : Yuck! Horrible generic song with Don Henly. Skip it, PLEASE! 1/5<br />7. Over You : This isn't much better than 'It's so easy' but it's more listenable. 2/5<br />8. Lucky Kid : Finally! After 4 mediocre tracks, we have a good one. Another one of the better tracks on this album. 5/5<br />9. Diamond Road : Although I said I don't like ballads or slow songs, this one is good. It could be better but overall, not bad 4/5<br />10. It's Only Love : If I hadn't heard Stevie's version first, I'd say I like this song a lot. However, I've heard Stevie's version and it's MUCH better. Even with that said, it's one of the more enjoyable tracks on the album. 4/5<br />11. Abilene : This is pretty good. Nothing ground breaking or exciting.(it's better than some of the other songs here..) 3/5<br />12. Hole In My Pocket : Same as above. 3/5<br />13. Weather Channel : Again, I know I said that I'm not one to like slow songs, but this is VERY good. Worth listening to the whole album to hear. 5/5<br />One thing I left out was the lack of lyrical depth in some of the songs (which i can't recall right now which ones were specifically lacking (most were)) Usually Sheryl Crow has good lyrics and upbeat songs. Overall, this album is not that great. It's better than some stuff out there, but compared to her other albums (which were all good), this one falls short. For the 7 good tracks on here, it's worth skipping and downloading the good tracks.
0684800713|2.0|I say that this novel was very boring.. A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self. All they thought about was sex and how they needed it all of the time. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all  that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.<BR>This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel; A place where dreams may happen.
B000001F5F|4.0|It's a musical example that draws comfort from T.L. Osbourne, Creflo Dollar, Robert Tilton, Pat Robertson and most importantly the late Rev. Finis J. Dake. Experience Dake-Bonoism heartily in the listening of this music.
B00005V9L1|5.0|How to describe &quot;Donnie Darko,&quot; the dark psychological drama written and directed by Richard Kelly? After seeing it I thought of the film as a sort of &quot;Ordinary People&quot; meets &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; with a touch of &quot;Pi&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot; thrown in. But ultimately that equation is unfair; &quot;Donnie&quot; is, in the end, a true original.<br />The film takes place in 1988. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character: a troubled, sleepwalking teenager who has recurring, frightening visions. Donnie is a quest to understand the forces that are affecting his life and sanity.<br />Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance helps to hold the film together. He is a quirky, offbeat leading man; at times frightening, at times appealingly vulnerable. Gyllenhaal's work is superbly complemented by that of an eclectic ensemble cast which includes Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore, and Noah Wyle. I was particularly impressed by Patrick Swayze's turn as a creepy, oily motivational speaker.<br />&quot;Donnie&quot; defies genre classification. It blends together elements of serious family drama, 80s period piece, horror, satire, and science fiction. In a sense, it is a deconstruction of the whole 80s teen movie genre. The script makes intriguing use of 80s pop culture.<br />&quot;Donnie&quot; has scenes of weirdness and absurdity, and is often punctuated by bizarre dialogue and strange, frightening imagery. And there are some really moving scenes that tap into the universal experience of human loneliness and the need for love. If there was ever a movie that had all the elements to make it a cult classic, it's the haunting &quot;Donnie Darko.&quot;
B00003CX5P|5.0|I remember walking out of the theater 3 years ago after having seen this and thinking \\"That was a damned good movie, I sure got my money's worth!\\" Well, didn't take long to find out not everyone shared my sentiments. I guess it was to be expected. After all the hype and the waiting, the fans wanted nothing less than for George Lucas to smash a grand slam homer right out of the park, so when instead he hit a solid triple, a lot of people felt cheated and let down, and so they focused on what they didn't get more than on what was delivered.<br />Which is a shame. Phantom Menace is a fine film in its own rights. In part, some of the complaints were because it was different from the others. Most notably, the comradeship of familiar characters was missing, the interplay between the heroes, heroines and sidekicks as they grew to trust each other and deal with their various character traits as they bounced from one close call to the next. There was no romance to speak of (unlike the great Han Solo/Princess Leia exchanges) nor was there much humor (as in the interplay between Chewbacca and the two `droids) and of course the central character is one we all know will soon transform into the evil villain of the first trilogy. In short, it simply doesn't have a lot of the key elements that everyone loved from the earlier films.<br />But so what? Like I said, this one is different, and should be judged on its own merits. What is good about this film? For starters, the awesome effects. Let's face it, that's what MADE the Star Wars franchise, lose them, and you've got just a pretty decent space fairy tale. There's some really cool concepts, too, I especially liked the various types of Battle Droids, and would not be surprised to see this idea become reality in our own military some time in the near future. Also, you've got a deeper, darker, more serious mood. There's not too much in the way of yuks and joking around because anyone with vision can see that this particular Galaxy isheaded for serious trouble. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala, who, IMHO, is an even better female lead than Carrie Fisher. She's got the same strength of character, only in a different guise. Instead of a feisty, resourceful rebel Princess, she, despite being only 18 or so, leads with great dignity and poise. Darth Maul is another great character, the only downside is he wasn't given more screen time. Young Annakin Skywalker comes off just as we'd expect, he's a slave, but clearly destined to move on to much bigger things. We are left wondering just how it is this budding Jedi ends up making the choice to side with evil, not to mention how he will interact with his future wife and son. We are left hanging deliciously, wondering just what Episode Two will serve up. <br />As for the bad, well, basically it can be summed up in three words - Jar Jar Binks. Rarely has a more annoying and useless character been given so much screen time in a major movie. He's funny ..... for maybe a minute or two. Then he should have been given the boot. Yet he seems to be onscreen almost as much as Luke in the original! What on Earth for? He brings nothing to the film to justify being so prominent. Further, he turns an otherwise really cool final battle scene into a 3 Stooges style comic farce in which he blunders about the battlefield taking out the enemy through sheer incompetence and dumb luck (maybe I should change the comic reference to Gomer Pyle). Anyway, if ever this film is subject to digital editing, Jar Jar should be \\"erased\\" from every scene where it is practical to do so. On a more minor note, I was less impressed than most by the Pod Race. Sure, it was cool but so is an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo. And both are more a case of artistic showing off than anything else. The Pod Race was special effects for its own sake, and didn't really add anything of importance to the movie. <br />But, other than that, this was definitely a far better than average film. It's just too bad that didn't live up to public expectations that were, quite honestly, so high as to be nearly impossible for mere mortal man to achieve.
B00004U8H4|5.0|There's alot to say about this terrific movie, but I can almost sum it up in 2 words:  CHRISTIAN BALE !<br />What an amazing performance from a little known actor (from England of all places).<br />This movie takes you on a whirlwind ride through the mind of Patrick Bateman, and what a ride it is.<br />From the beginning of the film, you become immediately drawn to this guy, he is strangely likeable, despite his many excesses (including of course, murder).   And the greed, lust and eccenticity of the Reagan 80's are well represented here, in hilarious form.<br />The highlights of which are the Business Card scene, Bateman's musical critiques, his being \\"on the verge of tears\\" because he was sure that he would not have a good table while entering a restaurant w/ his fiance, and of course...the murder of Paul Allen....I could go on and on.<br />To be perfectly honest, I don't know what to make of the ending, but by then I didn't care.   This was a great film, fully worthy of 5 stars.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have always enjoyed classics and own the entire series of books by J.K.Rowling - I know of the difficulties that one can encounter when taking a popular book or series and to convert that into a movie and my take on this movie is that an absolutely exceptional job was done on the special effects and storyline throughout throughout the movie.<br />The Quidditch match, the battle with the troll, and the wonderful scenes of the Hogwarts hall, complete with floating candles, were such marvels. These beautiful sequences were faithful to the book and were representive of the state of the art of CG animation.<br />Yes, certain parts of the book were skimmed over and some would say that some of the character developments were not followed well enough, but most of the people who saw the movie knew the plot and were repeat readers of the book series. I was very pleased with the movie interpetation and consider it an instant classic. The DVD will most likely carry within it extra scenes and in depth coverage of the making of the movie and I just see this as icing on an already substantial and wonderful world that Ms. Rowling has given to the world.<br />Speaking of the characters, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, and especially Professor Snapes were played to perfection by the actors and they matched my visions of them from the books.<br />My recommendation is very clear: Get the CD and watch it often. Read the books to keep the story details clear and then pass these wonderful treasures on to your children and nieces and nephews. This is an lovely and charming series and the movie does the first book justice. I can't wait for the next book and the next movie... Keep them coming Ms. Rowling!
B00006690G|5.0|For the 3rd time in almost as many years, Eminem comes solid with an album that can only be described as seriously ill. Undoubtedly this CD will sell by the bucketload, but this is not your typical crossover bubblegum rap album. Why? Firstly, dude has skills...if you still are doubting his ability for obvious reasons - please wake up. 2ndly, this dude is produced by Dre and is a producer in his own right, 3rdly - only a few rappers/groups (e.g. Akinyele, De La, Black Sheep etc) can through humour in their rhymes and not come off as corny. 4thly the guy has skills. 5thly, like a couple of other rappers in the game, namely the late great 2Pac, Biggie, (dare I say) Canibus Redman and Chino XL - Eminem can take ANY type of beat and flow nicely over it. 6thly - Dude has skills.<br />In terms of the tracks - all of them, are high quality. The production is crisp, the lyrics are sharp and, in the instances where there are quest spots, the pace of the album is adjusted accordingly - in fact, some of the best moments of the album are shared with others. The best collabo on this CD is not with D12, but surprise Eminem's daughter Hailie on the H-I-LA-R-I-O-U-S `Gone Crazy'. The 2nd best collaboration is a high octane song with Nate Dogg.<br />Even though Em is still bitter re: his ex spouse and there are plenty of low shots aimed at her/promiscuous women throughout the album, there are no KIM II's or Bonnie and Clydesque type tracks. Instead, there is a real surprising song on the album `ode to Hailie'. This vibe of the song is reminiscent of Biggie's `playa' i.e. it is a feel good track, performed by a rapper who knows that they can't sing but knows that they are going to produce a catchy song that is simple but off the chain.<br />In a sentence - buy this album, it is a good piece of art and it does what it aims to do - entertain
079284078X|5.0|A prequel of sorts to the 'Conan' movies. The gods were listening to me when I asked for more Arnold damage! He stars in this magical treasure as Kalidor (not Conan, upsetting!). Brigitte Nielsen is the red-headed warrior and she can really kick some stern! After the death of her sister, she vows to get revenge on the evil queen. Recycling some of the Conan plot, but that is awesome! Kalidor wrestles this metal alligators in a pit, fights Sonja and defeats many evil people in a castle! I was honored to have watched such an awesome movie as this. It's a shame that this film is not on DVD and it's a crime that MGM hasn't released this yet. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes this movie worth while and oh yeah! I forgot that Ernie Reyes Jr. was in this! He's a little runt of a prince and he's in love with Sonja, but he's too much of a toddler for such a warrior! YES!
B00005QG9J|2.0|Okay, I really Enjoy Incubus.  *pun, anyone?*  Hell, I became a fan back when Mike and Brandon were sporting dreadlocks.<br />Considering my history as a devoted fan, it hurts me to say that I was let down by this album . . .<br />\\"Maturing?\\"  \\"Growing up?\\"  My friends, there is a difference between \\"maturing\\" and abandoning who you are.  At one point in time, this band knew the difference.  <br />From Fungus Amoungus to S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (their best work) to Make Yourself, we watched them \\"mature\\" in many aspects but always remain true to what separated them from other bands.  Each album brought a different style but never took anything away from the genius that was Incubus.  <br />My friends, the Incubus of yesteryear was something special. <br />Their many influences came through in the music and resulted in something unique.  We saw a band that could be funny at times but were very socially conscious.  The lyrics were creative and unyielding - no punches were held.  The music was everything from funkadelic to spacey to all-out rock.  Even as the band began to \\"mature,\\" the ideals of non-conformism and individuality remained.  Together, the amazing music and innovative lyrics conveyed this message perfectly and set them apart from the pack.<br />Then, there was Morning View.  With the success of Make Yourself via \\"Stellar\\" and \\"Drive,\\" an album like this was inevitable.<br />Psuedo-philosophical.  Psuedo-inspirational.  Mediocre pop rock -- just what the masses ordered.<br />If you hopped on the Incubus bandwagon at \\"Drive,\\" you probably cannot fathom why anyone would complain about this album.  However, Morining View abandoned every element that caused many of us old-school fans to become fans in the first place (see above).  <br />Lyrically, Brandon tucked his tail and strayed from anything we heard in songs like \\"New Skin,\\" \\"Favorite Things\\" or even \\"Out From Under.\\"  He also sacrificed his rocker-intense and \\"funky\\" vocals and started crooning.  Furthermore, therest of the boys -- especially Mike -- never got the chance to show their true potential as musicians.  <br />I'll admit, Morning View does have it's moments.  At times, I can hear the old Incubus struggling to break through the teenybopper friendly cheese.  Overall, however, this band has so much more to offer.<br />I give Morning View two stars because this album is nothing special.  (This is a travesty because we only expect special things from Incubus.)  Take it or leave it . . .
0783230370|5.0|A pregnant man is the worst thing to have ever been created for movie history. Of all actors to have portrayed such an embarrassment, it was the lord Arnold Schwarzenegger. Disappointment! The man who made &quot;Twins&quot; and &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; made this terrifying display of cinema. Although, the movie is terrible, I loved it! Arnold Schwarzenegger proved that he can do anything because he's immortal. I almost forgot that when I was watching this. The first pregnant man in the world concept became fascinating to me and I appreciated Schwarzenegger, DeVito and Thompson's efforts to entertain me. This is a touching tale that the whole family should watch over and over.
0738206679|5.0|Very well written. The author was able to present his research in an easy-to-understand, extremely interesting and captivating manner - something which not too many people do very well. He matches his research findings to diverse examples of real life networks ranging from cell protein networks to networks of directors in corporate America. I think his writing is a great example of cross-disciplinary thinking. No prerequisites in network theory are needed to appreciate this book. It's written for the &quot;layman&quot;. This book has peeked my interest. Also, the references/notes provided at the back are very useful.
B00005N5S5|5.0|\\"The Terminator\\" directed by the brilliant James Cameron, is the most thought-provoking motion picture of the 1980's. What if computers controlled the world? Well, in 1984, a man named Kyle Reese and a terminator were sent to kill the mother of the rebel leader of the future. Sarah Connor supposedly gives birth to the leader of human resistance to the machines and his name is John Connor. The man was sent to protect her and the machine was sent to  change the course of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the ultimate mechanism that has no feeling and no heart! How frosty! It's the fight of a lifetime between the man and the machine, but unfortunately, the man loses. After many deaths fulfilled by the terminator, Sarah Connor crushes it. I was so perturbed with the extermination of Arnold, I turned it off right then. Arnold should never die in a movie. Good thing Hollywood made the best sequel to have ever hit the big screen to explain themselves. Shame on them!
0790729725|4.0|I love this movie; I think it's the best Mob movie of all time, and I am including \\"The Godfather\\" in that.  OK, that said, this is a really bad DVD issue, and I'm surprised Warner Bros. is still selling it in this state.  As noted many times before, it's single sided, and thus the disc is double sided (which means lots of chances to get your fingerprints all over it as you flip it over), but the picture and audio also doesn't look all that great to me (it's about the same as the VHS version, actually).  And, as noted, there's no extras.  You'd think a movie of this importance and quality would get a much better release, but I guess Warner has better things to do (like worry about how to avoid losing $50 billion in a quarter again.)  Still, though, I'm not going to give it one star, because it's a great movie, and flipping the disc over isn't too high a price to pay.  Since I don't know of any new version in the works, just buck up and get this.  And if a new version comes out, hell, get that too.  Just don't wait around for it.
B00004TRD8|5.0|&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; will go down in history as the best sequel ever made. Almost seven years have passed since the first film and it's the fight to keep young John Connor alive. The T-800 (Schwarzenegger) and a new terminator made of goo, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) go back to fight over little John Connor. Machines have never been so cool! Arnold Schwarzenegger gives the performance of his career and it's the best thing that ever happened to me! He wears leather, has the cool sunglasses and motorcycle, truly vast! The T-800 is programmed to protect the boy to ensure the future doesn't change and the liquid thing is programmed to terminate the boy. A fight to remember forever! Both machines are unstoppable, but the liquid has the advantage. Not fair! Arnold's fist just goes right through the gooey mess and it doesn't work. It was distraught that Arnold could not stop the mean machine no matter what he tried. James Cameron is the King of the World, not for &quot;Titanic&quot; but for this mesmerizing piece of genius. I am ecstatic that there will be another &quot;Terminator&quot; film and make this the trilogy that only God could have created. Ultra lordage!

B00000JMOJ|5.0|The most sadistic game show on television in the future is \\"The Running Man\\". Contestants run away from goofy-looking men that try to kill them. Survival is the name of the game and nobody has won. But, that changes after an innocent man named Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) goes on the show. People hate him because they think he killed some innocent people during a rescue mission. Naive people! When Schwarzenegger enters the arena, he brawls with a Christmas tree, a gigantic hockey dude, a flamethrower and Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, yes! This movie spawned many reality television shows like \\"Survivor\\" and \\"The Mole\\". Please, those shows are nothing without Arnold Schwarzenegger. The man, no immortal always brings something new to the movie theaters and this movie based on a Stephen King novel is pure ever-lasting!
B00006690F|4.0|As an album this is more serious than anything eminem's done before.  There isn't a single track that's all comedy.  Some very funny parts though.  He seems to be doing the right thing at the right time.  Addressing all news and controversy surounding himself and just about everything else that's going on today.  He's matured, but angry.  It seems that 2pac is his strongest influence and I think it's especially apparent here.  Just listen to Soldier.<BR>   Musically it's the best thing he's done yet and fans will be happy to know that Nate Dogg is on this (Till I collapse) and Obie trice (Drips) D12 (When the music stops) and Dr. Dre of course (Say what you say).<BR>  ...<BR>1.

6305364648|5.0|Divinity defined! Arnold Schwarzenegger has done it again! The Omega Sector's top secret agency pits Schwarzenegger against some coarse enemies in this big budget extravaganza. James Cameron needs to stick to making action movies and not dramas. Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) detonates bombs, stops terrorists and does the Tango! Pure lordage! No human being can do all of those things, not even James Bond. He has nothing compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger! However, the secret agent life is exciting, his home life is dull to the extreme. His wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) doesn't know her husband leads a double life and she wants more excitement in her life. She decides to do something outrageous with a used cars-salesman! Ridiculous! Tom Arnold is a comic genius and uses vulgar language. Plentiful! The action and the ending to this movie is pure splendidry. I was clapping throughout the whole movie and look out for a cameo from Charlton Heston! Pure God!
B00003CX9E|5.0|There are not enough accolades to describe Citizen Kane, so the DVD release was met with anticipation.  I wasn't disappointed.  Two commentary tracks, the first is by Peter Bogdanovich who was a close friend with Orson Welles during the last 20 years of his life, and also the author of a book long interview with the master director.   Bogdanovich provides a great amount of insight during the film.  He explains a lot of background into Welles thinking.  The second commentary by Roger Ebert is equally worthwhile.  Ebert spends his time talking about the production aspects of the film.  He explains the lighting and the use of ceilings and the way one-shot scenes and deep focus make the movie a technical miracle. <br />Besides all of that, you also get a 2-hour documentary on the making of the film and the controversy that surrounded it.  The Battle over Citizen Kane is actually an episode of the PBS show American Experience.  Well Done.  The original movie trailer is also a blast, as it gives away absolutely nothing about the film.  Even if you?ve seen the movie 2 dozen times, you'll find the DVD extras worth your time.
0800177975|5.0|People didn't like this movie for some reason. It's funny, smart, and action-packed. What's wrong with everybody? &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; is about a boy named Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) who receives a magic movie ticket from a crazy old guy. Madigan is a defiant kid who sneaks out of school to go to the movies. His action hero is Jack Slater (Immortal Arnold Schwarzenegger) and he has the opportunity to see the newest Slater movie before it opens. Well, as he watches the opulent cinematic experience, the ticket thrusts him into the screen and he steps into a whole new world. The movie world. How absurd you say! NO! The most original plot in years. Madigan meets his hero and helps him find the man who killed his favorite second cousin. Big mistake for that man! The chemistry between Schwarzenegger and O'Brien is wealth! This movie should have made more money in the theaters and is under-appreciated. This work of art came from the same whiz kid who made &quot;Predator&quot;. Truly prominent work!
B000055WIQ|5.0|At first I thought people were just saying that it was scary. Now I believe them! This was and is the scariest movie I've ever seen. Now I know there are some that will say this movie didn't scare them. Those people probably only had enough guts to watch the one on t.v. This movie terrified audiences before, and it will continue to. Then there are some people who have already made up there mind about it, they watched it just so they could give it a bad review. People there is nothing wrong with being scared! Turn off the lights, open the window a bit to let in a draft, leave hallways dark, leave doors (inside your house) open, the house has to be dead quiet so that it will work better and pop in this movie!
B00005K3OT|5.0|If you want a 'feel good' movie with a wonderful, sweet story, watch CHOCOLATE.  Juliette Binoche, one of the greatest actresses alive, is absolutely fetching as the gypsy chocolate shop owner.  Her beautiful daughter played by Victoire Thivisol is also precious in her role.  An ensemble cast with Dame Judy Dench, Alfred Molina (who is wonderful as the self-righteous town mayor), a great Johnny Depp and Lena Olin are all characters that shape this romantic tale. <br />     In addition to a great movie, here is a story with no violence, bad language, or sex (some kissing and unseen moments).  It is so refreshing to know that movies like this are still being made!  I liked this movie so much that I paid to see it twice in the theater and then bought the video!
0738206679|5.0|I have been reading literature on chaos, fractals, phase transitions and networks for years. I found Linked to be the best single, simple explanation of these conceptual advances I have ever read.  Professor Barabasi has the gift of being able to both explain these difficult concepts to the novice while simultaneously challenging knowledgeable readers with his insights.  I would strongly recommend this interesting and intellectually stimulating book to anyone, in any field, who has ever puzzled over any kind of network.  In short, I strongly recommend this book to everyone.
0385503954|5.0|I have only read Amsterdam and Atonement, A Novel by Ian McEwan.  Now I want to read the lot.  McEwan has a captivating style.  He writes for the reader who savors wit and language and character and untidiness.  His stories are dark only in the way that life can be when people presume rather than understand.<br />The many characters in Atonement are richly drawn. McEwan first introduces the most significant character, Briony Tallis, the precocious \\"baby\\" of her family, fussing over a play she hopes will cause her older brother to follow a more promising romantic path. Briony is caught up in a fairy tale interpretation of life with no allowances for wrong doing.  The Narrator describes her as a thirteen year old fantasist and control freak realizing that childhood has ended but still imagining that she has the power to right all the wrongs in her family's world.  She misinterprets events early on, and the rest of the story for her family and several pivotal charaters is shaded by the results of her willful and disastrous commitment to her interpretation.  I feared I would find Briony tedious and hateful as the novel commenced, but I believe she becomes more compelling as she \\"grows up\\" and honestly faces her responsibility in the complete disruption of her family and the estrangement of her older sister.<br />I enjoyed so many aspects of this book.  I was particularly engaged by the Narrator's reflection on writing and the importance of books in shaping the intellectual and emotional life, and how the novel can only be trusted to reflect the author's idea of order or lack of it.  I find it amusing that the Tallis family library figures subtly, but importantly into the story.  The hope of atonement, sincerely and actively seeking absolution or forgiveness, is obviously important to this story, and as often happens, it is never achieved in the tidy way so many writers and readers would want to wind up the story.  Briony desperately wants forgiveness, yet she never canforgive herself.  Her adult life is shaped by this quest, and though she does achieve recognition and the respect of so many, she understands that she will leave the world having caused suffering that no novel can ever correct.<br />McEwan's endings are breathtaking in their irony and finality.  The final pages of Atonement are truly gemlike in the facets they reveal about the Narrator and all the preceding pages.
0316926345|5.0|Like most great novels, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is about a great many things--not the least of which is the decline of English aristocracy.  But at center, Evelyn Waugh's greatest novel (and one of his few non-satirical works) is about religious faith, and how that faith continues to operate in the lives of even those who seem to reject it, and how that faith supports even those who falter badly in it.<br /><br />The story is complex. It is told in the first person by narrator Charles Ryder, who develops a close and possibly homoerotic relationship with artistocrat Sebastian Flyte while the two are students at Oxford.  Seduced by the glamor of Flyte's way of life and the beauty of his ancestrial home at Brideshead, Ryder becomes deeply involved with Flyte's family as well--a Roman Catholic family in which the various members either use their religion to manipulate others or actively rebel against it.  With the passage of time, Sebastian's drinking expands into alcholism--which appears to be fueled by his guilt at rejecting the church, a rejection which may be based on his own uncertain sexuality.  Ryder consequently transfers his affections to Sebastian's sister Julia--but again religion influences their relationship: Julia has made an unfortunate marriage, and although she is willing to engage in an affair with Ryder, she may not be willing to divorce her husband, an act that will cast her completely outside the bounds of her faith.<br /><br />The characters involved in the story are often extremely charming, but they are not necessarily admirable, and the passage of time in the novel nibbles away at their charm in such a way as to expose their flaws; even the narrator, Charles Ryder, gradually emerges as a somewhat second-rate person of dubious integrity.  Even so, there remains a strange element of hope in the novel, a sense of God's grace and mercy even in the face of deliberate affront.  Poetically written with considerable beauty and a sense of lost innocence that haunts the reader, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a too-often misinterpreted and misunderstood book that demands a thoughtful reading to get down into the marrow of its thematic bones.  Powerful, beautiful, memorable--a book to read and enjoy again and again.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerBRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a too-often misinterpreted and misunderstood book that demands a thoughtful reading to get down into the marrow of its thematic bones.

0684800713|1.0|If you want to read a great book do not read The Sun Also Rises, by Ernest Hemingway.  This book was on the list for students who are college bound.  I decided to read this book.  It was the worst book I have ever read.  There is not a plot in this book.  Through this book there are mainly five characters.  Cohn, Brett, Mike, Bill and Jake.  The book is written from Jake's point of view.  Each night  these five people go into town and drink wine and get drunk.  Most of the book is about their conversations between each other, but all they do is argue between themselves. The whole book is about how they go out each night and drink, fight, and learn to get along for the time they are out together.  They also go to bull fights.  The book is about Jake's life for about six weeks.<BR> There were three \\"books\\" in this book.  The first had no meaning at all and should be taken out.  It is about Cohn's childhood.  The middle of the book is about their night life during the Festival, and the third is after the Festival and how Brett and Jake kind of hook up.  If there were a plot it would be about how Jake loves and loses Brett but then in the end he gets her back.  This book was very predictable because they did the same thing every day.  If you like reading about everyday life when you drink all the time and go out and don't have a job this would be a good book for you, but this book didn't keep my interest at all.  I would not recommend this book.  How in the world did this book make it into fifteenth place for college bound students?<br />Nicole Stay
0425173895|4.0|This is the Agatha Christie novel that had both her competitors and critics crying foul at the solution to the crime--but although the book has its weaknesses, the solution is not one of them. THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD remains one of the most startling novels in the entire murder mystery genre, and it should be very near the top of any murder mystery fan's reading list.<br />Told from the point of view of a village doctor, ACKROYD opens with a suspicious death--and this is followed by the murder of Ackroyd, a wealthy local who learns more about the suspicious death than it is wise to know, and whose death draws Hercule Poirot to investigate.  This is not actually one of Christie's more smoothly written novels; most of the characters (excluding Caroline, the village gossip, who is a delight) seem more than a little flat, the narrative drags a bit here and there, and the plot is extremely tricksy... but the conclusion is a stunner, perhaps the single most famous plot twist of Christie's long and revered career.  An absolute must read!
B00004XQP4|5.0|Ok, this is not like old green day, but hey, when Insomiac came out, it was metal and not punk-rock like dookie. This is just plain old rock. &quot;Minority&quot; is a great song that is probably one of my favorites by Green Day. &quot;Waiting&quot; is close to being my favorite Green Day song period. &quot;Castaway&quot; is a great song with a good guitar riff. I like the bass line in &quot;Warning.&quot; I don't like &quot;Hold On&quot; one bit. It is the worst Green Day song ever (I mean it). &quot;Deadbeat Holiday&quot; is a pretty good song with nice vochals. Why is &quot;Misery&quot; everbody's favorite song? If you ask me, it's too dull and long, but hey, two bad songs is not that much. I think &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; is a great way to finish off the album. I think that you shouldn't buy this if you are a true punk-rocker who loves Bad Religion and Rancid, but if you are a true Green Day fan (like me), then buy this. Hey, you might even like this if you listen to Bad Religion and The Offspring and Stuff.
B00006690F|5.0|This new Eminem album is his best yet. It is a lyrical masterpiece. There isn't a bad track on this album. If your a fan this is a must have.
B00005R2EY|4.0|One of the best live albums by a long shot. If your a collector, its an absolute must.The live version of, \\"Like Spinning plates\\" with its piano introduction will leave you mesmorised. Johnny rocks on \\"idiotheque\\" with a version thats even better than the original Kid A track. The last track \\"True love waits\\" may not appeal to some people, but nether the less, its still a good song. If you like Radiohead, youll love this. A must.....
B0000214F0|1.0|&quot;Caligula&quot; is the kind of film that reminded me of everything that was the opposite of good.The opposite of light.It also reminded me what the feeling of shame is all about.This is a terrible movie.I would put it right up there with &quot;Salo,or the 120 days of Sodom&quot; which I hail as the worst film ever made.&quot;Caligula&quot; only serves its purpose of satisfying those with sick minds and it takes away the art of cinema.I have nothing more to say.
B00006690F|5.0|If you haven't bought this cd yet...go buy it!!! It's incredible how Eminem could top the Marshall Mathers Lp within such a short time...I just bought it and I love it! Your on something if you don't buy this cd! My personal favorite songs are Business, Without Me, Square Dance, and Say What You Say. I'm glad i bought this cd becuz i couldnt be happier. Listening to Eminem's music makes me feel alot better becuz the guy feels just like me...always getting pushed around and stuff. This Cd is alot better than any previous Eminem Cd if you ask me so please don't think twice about buying it....JUST BUY IT ALREADY!!!
B00005JKEC|3.0|Denzel Washington's electrifying perfomance is what helps what would otherwise be a routine cop thriller earn an extra star. Ethan Hawke is also very good as a rookie cop on his first day on the job \\"training day\\", who finds himself appalled by, then drawn into, the use of excessive force and lack of morality and conscience of his partner. Some of the violence here is pretty unsettling, but who said police work (and life) was all roses? And there's more than a few thorns in this movie to prickle the viewers subconscious.
B000063V8R|4.0|I really do not notice things like the crews quarters or uniforms, I have to say. I enjoy a good story and sometimes the various Star Trek series have provided them. Sometimes they are really dumb also. I am not sure if all of the viewers realize when they are watching the show as intensely as some of the other reviewers here apparently do, but these Star Trek characters are fictional. Nevertheless, good character creates good television and one episode in this volume rates as the best Star Trek episode ever of any Star Trek series. \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" is a marvelous not to be missed work of television drama. I am sure that the intense viewer will find even more enjoyment out of this episode than the casual viewer, but even a first time watcher will find it to be excellent. So for that reason I recommend this dvd set. A good season for a good show.
B00003CXI0|4.0|I'll begin my review by saying that I have never read any of the books . My first exposure to the books was at a &quot;writer's workshop&quot; that turned out to be run by old ladies in a church hall. They were offended by the &quot;witchcraft&quot; (booga booga!) and thought it was &quot;violent&quot;. Woo hoo, so's the bible. So I think you can understand my aversion to them.<BR>But when I bunged the tape in my VCR I was pleasantly surprised. This is a bit slow at times, and very long (2 and a half hours); but the visual effects are excellent and it features a very good supporting cast including Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and Richard Harris. You probably know the story, so I'll spare you my rambling and you can go buy it or rent it. I'll have to check out the next HARRY POTTER  movie when its released.
B00005LOUP|5.0|First I thought I'd share what happened when we were at the theater. The scene where Grinch is trying to figure out what to wear, he jerks the tablecloth off without disturbing the items on the table, walks off, then goes back and knocks everything over including the table. There was a general chuckle over this scene but in the quiet after that a young voice protested, \\"That's NOT funny!\\" For a moment Jim Carrey was upstaged by a young fan.<br />Now, I grew up on the classic animated version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas with Boris Karloff as the narrator. I admit that I was skeptical going into the theater. How much nonsense padding was going to be added to make this a feature length film? How would the Whos look \\"live\\"? Could Jim Carrey sing?! The additions made added an entirely new dimension to this classic story. The sets and makeup incredible. And Carrey's version of \\"You're a Mean One Mr Grinch\\" is delightful.<br />I think the most significate difference between the old and the knew comes towards the end when the Grinch is about to give up and allow the sled to fall from Mt Crumpet with the words \\"it's only presents.\\" Then Cindy Lou appears atop the sled with the words that \\"no one should be alone on Christmas\\". It was only when someone, not something, was in danger that the Grinch reached inside of himself and saved Cindy Lou. That to me is a far better message than the original.<br />Add this one to your Christmas tradition. Share it with family and friends. After all that's what it's all about - people, not things.
6305165912|5.0|...because you may find that 10-20% of all sentences you speak afterwards will reference it.  At least that's what happened to our clique.<br />Just as many others, I didn't even come close to fully appreciating this movie the first time I watched it.  After Fargo, a movie with so much plot and structure it smacks you across the face, this just seemed disjointed and confused.  There were still overtly funny parts, and I definitely enjoyed it, but it's when you start catching the subtleties that it blows your mind and interpolates itself into your daily speech.<br />The Coens add such a HUMAN element to this movie...their use of sentence fragments, incoherent thoughts, and completely disjointed conversations (especially the bowling alley scenes) is unbelievable.  The thing that really makes the flick to me is that almost every line in the latter half of the movie has a predecessor...in other words a character will say something early in the movie, then you'll hear someone else (usually the DUDE) use the same phrase in completely the wrong context - chinaman, beaver, \\"the parlance of our times\\", \\"this agression will not stand\\", \\"my concern is\\", Ralph's grocery store - all of these phrase are tossed out early and completely botched later in the movie.  If that doesn't strike you as something that would be funny, then you might not like this movie.  But if you do appreciate stuff like that, upon repeated viewings this movie will most likely change from a bunch of over-the-top stupidity to one of the most tight-knit, layered movies I've ever seen, especially for a comedy!!  I still figure things out EVERY time I watch it.<br />(For example, upon last viewing I realized that there is \\"German techno-pop\\" playing in the background when we see the \\"nihilists\\" for the last time - brilliant!!!)<br />Basically, if you are someone who considers the dialogue of a movie to be a vital ingredient to your enjoyment, then you'll most likely LOVE this movie to the point of fanaticism.If you're more about the plot, then you'll probably like Fargo or Hudsucker Proxy better, especially on first viewing.

B000002G7G|4.0|the velvet underground, in my opinion, were most together in their first 3 albums. their second, however(White Light/White Heat) is missing a spark that the other greats have. that leaves <BR>two, The Velvet Underground and Nico, and The Velvet Underground as the velvet's best.<BR>1. this album is uncomparable, totally different, another side, whatever you want to call it, yet great, to vu and nico. buy it. <BR>i listen to these two in different moods and are therefore a success.<BR>2. missing one star, i would sub 1/2 but i cant and i dont think the album is perfect and worthy of a five, because it lacks the extremes of vu and nico. vu soothes into the slower,more touching  moods,(Jesus,Candy Says,Pale blue eyes)while nico sticks with the anger and filth(. they are both great, and worthy of your 11 dollars. <BR>if you are looking for one at a time, i suggest to buy the third first and the 1st second. then go on to v.u, then go on to white light/white heat, then get the Lives, then loaded, but to stay away from sticky and untrue compilations. stick to the albums.

6304078145|2.0|This weird movie tries hard for a kind of quirky (and obscene) humor, but it merely succeeds in being bizarre. An idiotic bell boy goes to four different rooms during the course of New Year's Eve and gets involved in four different, rather miserable situations (though those who are fond of bare breasts will enjoy the first act, in which a coven of witches seduces the bellboy.) The acting is mannerist and rather poor, and I can't say much else for this movie except that I'm sorry I wasted the time seeing it.
B000002U82|5.0|There's no word to say how incredible it is. Select the firt albun song, turn up the CD sound, press play button and forget the remote control. Forget the time too. Turn the light off, close your eyes. Good Trip.
B000063UR2|1.0|It has been a very long time since I've seen a DVD that was worse than this one (actually: these two) regarding image and sound quality. <br />The transfer must have been taken off a composite video source. Extremely poor resolution, colored halos along edges of high contrast and dissatisfying shadow delineation are a clear giveaway. There is not one sharp image on DVD one (director's cut) and DVD two (theatrical release) is not much better! To make matters worse for people with progressive displays, the progressive flags from DVD-1 are either missing or have been set wrongly which results in noticeable jaggies during fast movement and dissolves throughout many scenes.<br />The sound of both DVDs is a great disappointment as well. The dts track of DVD-1 lacks dynamic range and has no low-end to speak of. In fact, for most of the time it sounds more like a poor upmix from a monaural source, complete with (occasional) hiss and an over-emphasized high-midrange. Dialogues are audible from the center speaker only, with no soundstage and body at all. When there are multiple actors speaking at the same time, it gets awfully crowded in the center channel. The few scenes with nice surround ambience sound artificial and reverberated. DVD-2 sounds a little more natural and features the excellent musical score by &quot;Tangerine Dream&quot;, which I find much preferable to the uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score of the director's cut. Tangerine Dream manage to inject an emotional quality with their music that is otherwise missing from the film. Unfortunately, the fidelic performance is somewhat crippled through the fact that DVD-2 features only a Dolby Surround 2.0 sound track with all its well-known limitations. <br />All things combined, this DVD set is one of the worst of all time and the fact that it is advertized as &quot;the ultimate edition&quot; is simply criminal! It's a slap in the face of all customers. I recommend that anyone who owns a TV larger than 20 inches shouldstay well clear of this awful product. The quality offered here is simply abysmal.
0441003257|4.0|Reading the Prologue alone would make you laugh out loud. But unfortunately, I found the rest of the book to be not as hiliarious as the Prologue. It did, however, make me chuckle throughout though, with it's clipped humour and absurd imagery.<br />It's the sort of book you can pick up where you left of over many days and read it in bits and pieces as you wait for the public transport. There's no hurry to finish it as the plot isn't intense, and as (i feel) the entire novel, isn't about the plot. It's just something to make you laugh and perhaps give you a quick insight into certain biblical doctrines and how they might prove to be wrong. <br />There are some interesting ideas introduced, and i liked how Gaiman and Pratchet shaped the horsemen of the apocalypse.<br />The narrative is a wonderful and engaging, and the images absurd to the point of being undeniable wonderful. Imagine an Angel and a Demon sitting together over  tea, talking about the end of the world. It's absurd, and there's something very pleasant about it all as well. <br />It did seem to lack an X factor though, something to truly make it entirely satisfying. Maybe it was the way the characters weren't built up well enough. Aziraphale and Crowley were well crafted, no doubt, but Adam, or the antichrist, could have done with a little more devling into his psyche since he happens to be the most psychologically complicated character.
B000002H5I|5.0|I genuinely don't think this disk could be any better. There is not a single song on here that isn't a work of art. I owned this on tape initially, but I had to get the CD because the tape was getting worn out, because I listened to it constantly - particulary to Baby Can I Hold You, Why, and Talking About A Revolution. <br />Chapman's voice is stunning, particularly on the a capella Behind The Wall, which never ceases to bring a chill down my spine. I always thought I didn't like folk music, but Chapman has made me reconsider that belief. Her lyrics are meaningful, and the collection of songs come together to form an overall feel, a mood, that is extremely moving and empowering. She exemplifies how music can bring people together and be an impetus to change, ala the greats like Bob Dylan. Make no mistake -- this is a political album and Chapman wears her left wing leanings like a badge of honour. If you can't tolerate her political views, you probably won't like the album as much as her core fans. That said, her voice and the music itself may make it possible for you to give it at least an intial listen. Chapman is more than a singer and musician - she's a poet, and her message is one that I believe we all need to heed. <br />I highly reccommend this album to everyone. Even if you don't agree with her politics, hopefully she'll make you think. At the very least, you'll be listening to one of the purest, best voices in modern folk/r&amp;b/soul around today.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|Most reviews--whether they are written by professionals or amateurs--talk about how brilliantly this film is made. All of those reviews are correct. Aronofsky is one of the finest young directors alive, the performances (with the exception of Jared Leto, who is merely good) are all excellent, the audio track is chilling and the visuals in this picture are truly magnificent. Even the post-production elements--such as editing--are nearly perfect. <br />But I think that most reviews don't see past the brilliant filmmaking to find the glaring drawbacks of Requiem. First, these characters are two-dimensional, at best. The viewer doesn't get get a feel for their pasts (with, perhaps, the exception of Ellen Burstyn's character, who is made three dimensional by the actress, not the writer or director) or their motivations or their dreams or their wishes for life before they became addicts. That's a dangerous thing to do in any film, but especially in one like this; one that is expecting the viewer to care about the eventual tragedies these people face. One that actually requires the viewer to care in order for the feature's political statement to mean anything, to have any relevance. Did this movie overcome the character development? To a certain extent, yes it did, if only because the performances were so amazing and the technical elements of the film so flawless. Nonetheless, Requiem would have succeeded even more if these characters had been more real.<br />That brings me to a thematic discussion. Requiem, much like Traffic, looks into addiction, drug use and it's effects. Unlike Traffic, however, Requiem doesn't take a relatively neutral stance while doing it's best to accurately depict the drug world. Aronofsky, in fact, makes this film a resounding condemnation of drugs, as if saying that any and every person who uses drugs will eventually meet the same fate these characters do. Not that it matters, but I have persoanlly never done a drug (other than alcohol); I do know several people who use occasional substances and I only know one person who's life has been significantly negatively effected, though no where near to the same degree as these characters; most users I know are in fact quasi-users and lead perfectly normal lives. What I'm saying is this: drugs don't inevitably lead to these sorts of situations; to imply that they do--as Requiem for a Dream most certainly does--is not only excessively pessimistic, it's also a bit insulting. Setting aside any policital views, Aronofsky, would have been better served if he'd had at least one sane, occasional user who's life succeeded, than he was by having a plethora of spiralling hell-like situations for every character.<br />Ultimately, is this film worth viewing? Absolutely. It is a very impressive cinematic achievement, but there are still some glaring flaws that shouldn't be ignored.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Without a doubt, Pink Floyd have been one of the most controversial, influential, experimental, and relevant rock bands of the past 40 years.  They have changed the face of songwriting, album recording and production, experiments in musicianship, live performances and many other faccets of the contemporary music scene for years to come.  Echoes is an excellent 2 disc set with many versatile uses, all of which yield to a guaranteed experience of sonic bliss.  It is truly a collection of almost every single one of the band's greatest songs, and at the very least, the most popular ones.  <br />The songlist on this album is unforgettable, and it is assembled very well.  It has the flow and fluidity that any respectable Floyd fan would come to expect from them.  The songs transition very well from one to another, and the sagueway from one song to the next is rarely choppy (though going from the earliest bootlegs to their most recent studio albums does may feel somewhat out of place to more experienced listeners).  However, this minor irritance does not get in the way of the magical experience that is Echoes.  They are truly 26 wonderful songs by an truly amazing band, and every music fan on the planet would do well to at least give both discs a listen, at least once.<br />The only reason I hesitate and resist the urge to label this a certifiable 5-star purchase is because I do disagree with some of the song choices.  This is entirely a move of personal taste, but it docks points for me just the same.  For example, I think it could have certainly done without such tunes as &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; (from the largely unsuccesful Wall soundtrack--from the film, NOT the original recording) and I'm not a huge fan of some of the earlier singles such as &quot;Bike&quot; and &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;, though they are essential to encompassing Floyd's entire career, and certainly not throw-away tunes of any sort.  I would've personally included some more tracks such as &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot;, &quot;Lucifer Sam&quot;, and &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; (I am still astounded that the latter did not make this setlist).  However, I also understand the confines of album time limits, and realize that if a fan enjoys Echoes enough, they'll go out and buy Floyd's other albums in order to enjoy these lesser-known tracks (by all means do so, particularly Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, and Division Bell).  <br />All-in-all, there is absolutely no denying how great Pink Floyd, their music, and this collection of their greatest hits all are.  I promise you, if you are a fan of rock music of any (or every) variety, you would do well to pick up this album, and would be very hard-pressed to regret purchasing it.  It's worth every penny, and one thousand listens or more.  From the most hardcore metalhead to a casual classic rock fan, you are damned near guaranteed to enjoy this album and its wondeful musical selections for years to come.
B00005R2M3|4.0|The first time I heard about Shakira was in 1996 with her album &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot;(which I think it's her best until now), she is beautiful and has a great voice, in &quot;Laundry Service&quot; she gives us an excellent work in production and voice.<BR>The first single &quot;suerte/whenever, wherever&quot; was a big hit all over the world it reached #1 (suerte) and #6 (whenever..) in the US. The rest of the songs are very good, my favorites are: &quot;underneath your clothes&quot;, &quot;poem to a horse&quot; and &quot;te dejo Madrid&quot;.<BR>I'm very happy for Shakira, for her big success in the US but i think that Shakira Has made mistakes in her career like her album &quot;Unplugged&quot; which was a mess, how could she made that album where she only sang songs from one album and didn't sing her hits from her her first album, the production it's good because she changed some versions but the album was boring and i wonder how could she won a Grammy for it, well Shakira if you read this i'm sorry but it's the thruth.<BR>So I really recomment this album is really good has energy and felling, good work Shakira, you got it!!.<BR>I would had liked to rate this album with 5 stars but the mistake was the crossover of &quot;ojos asi&quot;/&quot;eyes like yours&quot;.

By the end of the drive, my list was unwieldly.  And we didn't even have the rights to publish the book yet.<br />I am not partial to self-help books. But this isn't that kind of book.

6301208773|5.0|James Bond movies are good but this was totally better.  It is a nice plot about how an ingenious terrorist plan can be spoiled by a single cop who is like the mastermind when dealing with terrorists.  The starts off with a NY cop John Mclane(Bruce Willis on vacation, meeting his seperated (not divorced wife) in a building called the Nakatomi Plaza.  It wasn't long before a dozen of terrorists take over the building not knowing there is a cop there.  Alan Rickman played a good role as leader of the terrorists \\"Hans Gruber\\" especially when outsmarting the police.  The cops don't listen to John except for one(The guy who played \\"Carl Winslow\\" from \\"Family Matters\\".  The gunn shooting was awesome and it even looked real unlike other movies.  You'll love the suspence as John Mclane trie to go through every terrorists so he could save the people and kill Hans.  This is a good movie, GET IT.

0684800713|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is an even steadiness of style and description, settings and characters. The smart reader understands this book better.  After researching on Hemingway, I find that &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; reflects his life.  <BR>The characters are often drunks, who love to travel and take a very big interest in bullfighting.  It's a great book with many consequences that deal with human nature.  <BR>The love affairs and jealousy occurs with everyday life for some people.  Hemmingway's style of writing is not the &quot;perfect style&quot; that we read in every other book.  He uses a vulgar style. Hemingway has created these characters to be continuously frustrating and apparently beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them friendly, attractive, and people that every human being can relate to.  <BR> I enjoyed reading his book.  And for his first book, I would say that he did very well.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it own.  I am interested in the social life that happens in the book.  The love affairs, drunkenness, and racial comments are things we deal with or see everyday. The way he describes the different places, such as Paris is so simple and laid back, making the reader feel as though they are really there. He has a unique style.  This is an enjoyable book if you are interested in the lifestyle that these characters live.
B000005ILF|5.0|I really liked this album.  It got some bad reviews and I heard that Sting didn't like it because it was released before he was ready.  However that all being said I love the feeling of this album.  It has a nice blend of song styles that compliment eachother and lend to a cool, mid-winter feel.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I found out about this artist in Rollingstone.  Their review of her new album intrigued me enough to purchase the album.  Her voice is so beuatiful and melodic.  I usually have her album playing while I'm working.  Wonderful.  Relaxing.  I recommend it to anyone who appreciates good music.
B00003CXI1|5.0|If you have never read the Harry Potter books, then watch this movie.  It tries to stay true to the book that it is based on, although there a few artistic liberties here and there.  This does not make me mad in the least, if you get the dvd edition, you will see 7 deleted scenes that didn't make it to the theatre (although they are on disk 2, and you do have to work for them), but it is worth it.<br />For those of you that do not like this movie, then I say you haven't seen it.  And if you have seen it and still don't like it, then this is my opinion that I am giving.  Either way, I didn't want to spoil the movie for those who may buy it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This Cd is very different than what I expected.  But I welcome the energy on this album.  It reminds me of an 80's record.  Full of fun up tempo songs that you can dance to and sing along with.  No doubt has come through again.
B00006690F|5.0|I have all of EM's albums and this one is the best with Marshall Mathers LP coming in a close second. He brings a wonderful political message to the hip Hop and White community that usually is never displayed by a white person in hip hop. I have been a fan since he was in the underground scene but this album is different. He used the other two solo albums and D12 album to get everyone's attention through shock lyrics. Now that he has our attention he drops some real thought provoking and hot lyrics that attacks Congress, Bush, the system, his mother etc.<BR>Cleaning out my Closet deals with family issues and the lack of love that he received from his mother or father...but the result...a sucessful, matured EMINEM that wants to and will be there for his daughter even if he cannot stay with his crazy wife! That is one hell of a message to send to young and old people...Black and White. oN ANOTHER SONG HE EVEN TALKS ABOUT THE DRAFT AND ANTHRAX. No bling bling garbage, just realness about unprotected sex and relationships leading to STDs and even some lyrics about hating rappers in the industry (Jermaine Dupri). Now on this track Dr. Dre and EM fire lyrics back and forth and literally eat and destroy Jermaine Dupri on wax. Jermaine made a big mistake by dissing EM and Dr. Dre. True Hip Hop heads like myself will respect the extremely hot beats produced by Dre. and EM on this album. This album gets 5 stars from me even if the lame a** Source will probably only give it 31/2. I am a 26 year old African American Male that can step back and look at the world and see that this album is a message to all of the upper class 10% who believe that they and their families are untouchable. Eyes are closed and Em will open them!
B00005A1PR|4.0|Indie arie is a wonderful artist.  I've had her album for a while, but right now I'm listening to &quot;I'm eady for love&quot; over and over again.  A talented songwriter and musician.  I admire her courage to be different.  Especially since she came out in the middle of the pop, lets show as much skin as we can, looks before talent era.  I do have to say, she is as beautiful as any pop princess or video babe.  A must have CD!
630512762X|4.0|This is more like 3 1/2 stars due to lack of extras, but the film itself is worth 4 stars. The best sound is the 5.1 Surround, making this loud and exciting movie come to life on the small screen. The Theatrical Trailer is the biggest extra on this DVD, and sadly it nearly ruins a great movie. One of John Woo's best movies too, if not his best movie. Still worth the money to buy the widescreen version.
B0000640SB|5.0|Men in Black was one of my favourite Hollywood blockbusters of the '90s.  One of only a handful successful comic-book translations in history, the film retained the irreverence and zany creativity of the best comics while adding the visual grandeur, attention to detail, and narrative focus of the best features.<br />Rewatching this movie now, it's lost none of its charm.  The meticulous Bo Welch production design is superb, director Barry Sonnenfeld's sense of pacing and comic timing impeccable, the Danny Elfman score absolutely perfect for its subject, and the cast is uniformly excellent.  Nobody else could have played the role of Agent Jay with such pizazz as Will Smith; Tommy Lee Jones delivers hands-down his best comic performance ever, Linda Fiorentino is delightfully weird as coroner Dr. Laurel Weaver, Rip Torn nearly steals the show as perennially grumpy, inscrutable agency head Zed, and Vincent D'Onofrio is fun to watch as Farmer Edgar/Edgar Bug.<br />The bonus materials are also great.  The &quot;editing workshop&quot;, which allows you to play with alternate footage and put together a new version of one of two scenes, is my personal favourite (although I actually agree with Sonnenfeld's poker-faced quip that, &quot;[The audience] will find out that everything I did was perfect).  &quot;The evolution of MiB&quot; gives a hint of the major changes that happen on (to) a big movie as it's being made, and the MIIB (Men in Black 2) teasers definitely suggest that MIIB is a must-see for summer 2002.
0440178002|2.0|I bought this book thinking it would be about the honorable warriors of fuedel Japan. Alas, i was let down, it was more of a love storie than about battles. I didn't like the book very much. But im 13 and I may not have fully understood its signifigance.
B000062TU1|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I thought it was excellent.  I saw it 2 more times in the theater afterwards, also.  It was not a great disappointment after reading the book, as most films are.  I was very anxious to get this movie and bought the DVD the first day it was released for purchase.  Again, the movie was very entertaining, and the DVD clarity added to the excitement.  As many of you may know, it is a two-disc set.  The first disc is for the movie, and includes theatrical trailers, and the second disc is for special features.  I was looking forward to seeing all of the special features, but the only good thing about it is finally reaching the Deleted Scenes.  The rest of the disc is a sort of a game, a &quot;quest&quot; for the &quot;sorcerer's stone&quot; - which holds the &quot;prize&quot;, the 7 deleted scenes.  To get to them, you must go through a boring, and long process to get there.  (Getting money to buy a wand, taking classes, and other things.)  In fact, it would not be a great loss simply buying the video, because it shows the never-before-seen footage anyway.  However, the clarity and neat surround sound on the DVD is also a good factor in the movie.  If you haven't seen the movie, I suggest you buy it - you won't regret the purchase.  It is a treat for the whole family.
B0000042H4|5.0|I recently listened to many different recordings of the Ring Cycle in order to ascertain a few things about the performances, conductors and singers (this took a really long time). I listened to this, the Levine collection (which is also pretty good) and the Bayreuth Festspiel collection also, among others.I found that on the whole, this collection exemplifies most of the things that I would ask of the cycle. My original intention in doing this was to create a Ring Dream Cast, and after I made it up, I found that most of the singers I put on my list were all on this collection. There are only two major changes I would have made, and those are the parts of Wotan, Mime and Siegmund. I personally prefer James Morris to Hans Hotter (though many people would not agree with me), Heinz Zednik to Gerhard Stolze (Zednik makes the character sound a bit more evil) and lastly, Jon Vickers to James King, though this was a bit of a toss up. Both do the part excellently. Other than that, there is very little to complain about on this collection.<br />The two complaints I have heard on these recordings are that 1) Hans Hotter was getting too old to sing this part at the time and 2) Wolfgang Windgassen is not an \\"adequate\\" Siegfied. There is some justification to the first statement (for I do believe that Morris has a fresher, stronger sound), but let me just say that  I doubt there is anyone who could compare to Windgassen in that part at the time.<br />I think one of my favorite quirks about this set is the somewhat extravagant casting of the great Fischer-Dieskau in the part of Gunther in Gotterdammerung. I hardly gave a thought to that particular character until I heard the insight that Fischer-Dieskau puts into it. I actually found out that there is a recording of Dietrich singing the part of Wotan in Die Walkure....perhaps a bit unorthodox, but I'd like to find that recording. <br />Anyway, yeah, so for the best all around Ring, this here is your best bet.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Im just going to rate the dvd, not the movie.  The picture quality was very good on my big sony crt using the component connections, the sound was also very good, making use of all surround speakers.  The pod race scene was especially thrilling.  Of course the sound could have been just slightly better in terms of surround speaker usage.  This is one of the top dvds i have, more should be made this way.  some are dolby digital and dts encoded, yet I might hear only 1 sound effect coming from the surrounds..  Overall a fantastic home theater dvd.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Hmm, I seem to be one of the only people on this site who liked the album. I noticed also that I was the only one who had never listened to Wilco before. I agree, this is certainly not alt-country(or, as it was classified at my local Hastings, Americana, the same genre as Pat Green and Eva Cassady). I can see why if you approach this album with pre-conceived notions about the sound how you wouldn't like it, because this is certainly not at all like the Jayhawks, my only other exposure with &quot;alt-country&quot;, but since I had no idea what to expect, I enjoyed it. My favorite song is Jesus, Etc., where I guess you can see a little folk roots with the opening string arrangement, but that's about the closest thing on the album to what I would consider &quot;alt-country&quot;. Maybe Wilco is searching for a new fan base. They should get one for this album. I've just listened to it once all the way through(yesterday) but I can already tell I'm going to like it.<br />To the disappointed Wilco fans: my condolences for your loss.<br />For anyone else: If you like Aimee Mann, especially the rockier I'm With Stupid or some of her bootlegs(Backfire, for example), parts of this CD, especially Heavy Metal Drummer, will really appeal to you. Kind of that upbeat rock that's neither sugary pop nor grungy suicide anthems.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Movies of course are meant to entertain, not instruct, but this movie does actually come close to pulling off an accurate historical portrait of a man that some considered a detestable prima donna, and others a brilliant tactician and hero. It is easy to form impressions of Patton while watching this movie: A narcisstic Patton fixated on his image in the mirror while getting ready for his first battle with German forces; a sarcastic playful Patton who replies \\"Every Goddamn day\\" to the question of his daily Bible reading habits; A self-absorbed Patton who must have his beach landing in Sicily refilmed many times; an insecure Patton who must beat Montgomery to Messina to prove his manhood; Patton as a brilliant military historian and tactician; Patton's belief in reincarnation and in personal destiny; Patton's antagonisim with authority while expecting his troops to accept his unconditionally; a Patton unable to control his emotions in the slapping of the soldier; Patton's pride of his troops on the March to Bastogne; Patton's belief in the intervention of God in human affairs (the asking of a \\"weather prayer\\" to clear the skies in order to make an assault upon the German forces at Bastogne); Patton as a 16th century warrior caught up in modern times.<br /> The cinematography and the acting in this movie are brilliant and it will no doubt endure as one of the best war movies of all time. One can probably say without doubt that Patton would find it difficult to function in the military of the 21st century, with its accountability to the press and its extreme emphasis on minimization of casualities. With a few exceptions, war is no longer glorified and troops are no longer viewed impersonally but as individuals. But courage is still viewed as a virtue, and this movie shows that Patton and those who served under him, had this in abundance.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Bah!  This is [junk].  The intricacies and intelligent lyrics of such masterpieces as Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn are all gone.  A group that once sounded like a full band with a poetic frontwoman now sounds like an inane [person] w techno gizmos that tend to repeat a beat and some stupid words over and over again.  It's clear that TRL has poisoned the band's, or should I say Gwen's, head and musical integrity.  There's never anything wrong with a band expanding its musical horizons (Incubus has done this well as has Travis Meeks with Days of the New's RED album, which was the most overlooked album of 2001) or with writing upbeat songs (once again, Days of the New's RED album, Bob Dylan's latest, Incubus, Barenaked Ladies, and the legendary Beach Boys and Beatles), but that's no excuse for poor instrumentalism and cheesy lyrics.  This is the kind of music listened to by casual music fans whom don't expect much out of their art, who listen to radio all the time and only to certain bands who are trendy, just before stepping on to the next fad, leaving the old ones behind, who think that Creed is a better band than Pearl Jam, etc.  Hopefully, this is just a phase and the band goes back to writing meaningful music and not this inane, low-brow [tuff]rwise they're official sell-outs.  Bah!
B00005JKGK|5.0|I'm an Asian male and I have no problems whatsoever with the depiction of men in the film.  It's really pretty much the same case with Beloved and Color Purple.  They're female books written with a feminist slant, but considering how male chauvanistic and polygamistic Confucianism is, you know, the book isn't totally wrong.  Certain parts such as the 'tiger crouching in the shadows'  were made exotic to suit a foreign audience but I enjoyed it.  It's like fortune cookies. <br />I loved the film.  (Though some parts were a bit melodramatic).  And I know this is going to sound very suprising but the film is much better than the book.  The book does not put the stories into the context of a single dinner gathering, so it lacks this overall coherance that the movie provides and the ending of the book is just so draggy, detailing the whole trip from Guangzhou to visit some Aunt and on to see her sisters.  The movie cleans it up very well and the pacing is good.  (And for those who were wondering, the Mandarin spoken here is proper, understandable and coherent, unlike Crouching Tiger. *Yuck*)   The characters in the movie were less real than the characters in the book, but  the effect of this allowed for a more emotional response from the audience.<br />I especially liked the scene where Suyuan places her necklace over June towards the end and comments about her having a 'quality heart'.  It's very moving, and so too the part when Ying Ying tells Lena, \\"Losing him does not matter, it is you who will be found.\\"<br />This movie's a real gem.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Though I like both major actors, I avoided this movie for awhile, mostly because the the prominence of the mugs of two of the biggest movie pretty boys of all time posititioned prominently on the cover.  And the start of the movie didn't help, either.  You've got Younger Hunk waltzing into a Chinese prison, allegedly as a doctor giving out cholera shots to the prisoners.  Just like the start of a James Bond film, you're expecting Younger Hunk to escape the prison using some new-fangled gadget like flying shoes while a hot babe is ready with his cold drink as soon as he's out of immediate danger.  <br />Well, surprises on top of surprises, the movie doesn't head that way.  Instead, Younger Hunk gets captured, and spends 99% of the rest of the movie in the slammer, getting his hunk face messed up quite a bit, probably by guards whose girlfriends like Brad Pitt way to much to suit them.  <br />But don't worry girls (and some guys).  We get to see him in his glory through most of the movie, as Older Hunk steps in to see what he can do to rescue Younger Hunk.  Problem is, Older Hunk is on his last day at the CIA, most of his security is gone, and a lot of his co-workers wish he would just go away.  So O.H. has to explain his connection to Y. H. to these people, which gives us a lot of scenes with OH showing Y.H. the tricks of the spy game.  <br />I liked several things about the movie.  While the whole point of the movie is for O.H. to spring Y.H., and the final scene to do this does involve force, it's not your usual action picture where everything is settled at gunpoint.  It's the planning of the operation, where O.H. has to dig in his past, and cash in some major favors with people to get it done, while keeping certain CIA managers in the dark.  How he does it is probably very unlikely, but at least brains, and not brawn drive the movie.<br />I also like where several times during the movie, both Hunks need to pause to question how down and dirty they are willing to get to get a mission done.  For example, Y.H. is given instructions at the end of a mission to leave a person he was rescuing behind enemy line, almost insuring the death of that person.  O.H. asks his collegues at one point if they remember when it was easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  We are taken all over the world on several missions, where we see that the spy game is rarely a black-and-white, good guys vs. bad guys situation. <br /> That, and having Y.H.'s face get really messed up make this a very intelligent thriller.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is a fabulously talented lyricist, and true talent doesn't fade; you might be able to find fault in the morality of his words, but never can you justly critizise his genius in poetry.<BR>     His 3rd album \\"The Eminem Show\\" is the album that will silence all but the most narrow-minded of detractors.  Open your mind to this album and you will see that these tracks will stand the test of time; just plain and simple artistry.<BR>     While \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" was full of outrageous humour, and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" shocked us with a first hand rendition of Eminem screaming and strangling his wife, \\"The Eminem Show\\" tells us directly how the man behind the mask feels about his life's issues.<BR>     Love him or hate him, Eminem is here.
0142000655|3.0|Steinbeck incorporates a number of biblical themes in his novel, East Of Eden. I strongly recommend  readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible. Biblical themes set aside; the plot of the novel is entirely captivating. The binds of brotherhood and family are constantly tested and the reader is able to witness firsthand how important personal values contribute to one's success in life.
0783225792|5.0|If you think you love movies and have not seen Casino then you should be ashamed of yourself.  Not even Sharon stone and her terrible acting can ruin this movie.  Peschi and Deniro are at the top of their game.  This is the best movie about the mob and Las Vegas that you will ever see, bar none!!<br />WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
B00003CXZ1|4.0|\\"Tomb Raider\\"--the movie--is just what the previews indicated it would be:  \\"Indiana Jones\\" with curves.  Lara Croft, the clever, gun-toting heroine is fun to watch as she tracks down pieces of an artifact that will enable the possessor to control time.  The combination of having to solve interesting puzzles and kicking butt makes this a cut above the typical action movie.  Her hunt takes us around the globe as she races against an astronomical deadline and the obligatory bad guys who also seek the artifact.  Angelina Jolie makes Lady Croft a lot of fun.<br />Although I'm not usually a fan of chase-scene-followed-by-explosions movies, I truly enjoyed \\"Tomb Raider.\\"  In fact, I became so hooked that I bought the video game--something else that I usually don't do.
B00005JCAA|2.0|I have to admit I throughly enjoyed the first half hour of the film. The interaction between Pitt and Hopkins in the study was masterful. At this point I thought I stumbled apon a gem in the sea of melodramatic garbage. It turns out I was in for another disapointment. Does Martin Brest have to make susan cry constantly.
0385493622|2.0|I read Singh's FERMAT'S ENIGMA after reading Singh's CODE BOOK. Unfortunately, the latter is by far the better book. Although the CODE BOOK manages to cover both the personal and the quantitative side of the recent revolutions in cryptography, FERMAT'S ENIGMA does not attempt to break into the actual mathematical proofs at all. The result feels like one of those NBC human interest stories that take up airtime from the Olympic Games. The essence is in the math, but we hear instead about the innovators' daily lives.
B0000636UN|5.0|This is Sheryl Crow's best work so far.  Her hit &quot;Soak Up The Sun,&quot; is all it's cracked up to be.  My favorite song on this CD is &quot;Steve McQueen.&quot;  It has such a good rocker tempo to it, with a brilliant intro and excellent lead guitar breaks.  She just keeps getting better with time.  I was very impressed with her first and second CDs, but this one takes the cake.  Although, they have very different music styles, could Sheryl Crow become the next Carly Simon with her confessional writing style?  Good job, Sheryl!
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie beautifully depicts what has been missing from American cinema - a romantic comedy in its purest form. A magical, realistic love story that doesn't resort to absurdity, say like Kate & Leopold. Audrey Tautou delivers a luminous performance as the title character. Her performance immediately draws the viewer in. She is supported by a wonderful supporting cast of characters, especially in my mind Lucien the assistant grocer and the younger Amelie. Also keep an eye out for the gnome.<br />This is truly an inspired movie that captures the magic of romantic comedies without force feeding the viewer romance and comedy (think Serendipity). Both the romance and comedy is subtle and wonderfully portrayed. If you've been searching for a well-done romantic comedy, this is it. Though the subtitles may be off-putting to some viewers, this is not a difficult movie to follow. Give it a chance - you will truly be glad you did.<br />A brilliantly acted, well told story that will leave the viewer with a smile on his/her face - Amelie deserves the highest mark. 5 stars.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have had this cd 4 a year and i'm still not sick of it. It has great songs like \\"Papercut\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", \\"Points of Authority\\", \\"Crawling\\", \\"In the End\\", and \\"Place for my Head\\". All the other song rock too. \\"Cure for the itch\\" is all Mr Hand scratching alot. This cd is always on in my house. It never gets old and uh... go bye it!!!

0446677450|1.0|Granted the story of the two dads makes for an interesting read, plus the author writes in a manner that's motivating, but closer inspection reveals there's no practical advice you can put to use.<br />Kiyosaki starts off with a rather long rant about the poor quality of our educational system in regards to personal finance, then expands to a \\"haves vs. have nots\\" argument.  Both arguments I agree with for the most part.  So what's the solution?  Simple, says Kiyosaki, just make your assets generate enough cash flow so you don't have to work anymore.  Easy, right?<br />From this point until the second half of the book, the author argues that real estate is a liability, not an asset.  I find this hard to understand considering he admits the majority of his wealth was accumulated due to buying and selling real estate.  He considers buying and selling stocks an investment, but not real estate?<br />He then goes on to say the \\"big secret\\" of the rich is through the power of corporations.  It's at this point an intelligent reader should discover that this book is grandiose in theory, but lacking in specifics.  There are no steps to pursue, no ideas to follow, not even a basic framework on what an uninformed reader should even begin to study in order to learn these \\"big secrets\\".  The emperor has no clothes.  He does, however, have many $200+ items at the back of the book to sell you.<br />The truth is, authors like Kiyosaki strike a chord with all the gloom and doom examples of people on the brink of bankruptcy.  Well, duh!  You probably aren't looking at a book like this unless you're trying to improve your financial health.  A lot of the five star reviews use the word \\"motivating\\" in their description of this book.  Chances are you were already motivated before you started reading it.  As far as specific steps to take to make a difference in your life, you'll need to look elsewhere.
B00006690G|5.0|Again, Eminem delivers a tighly wrapped album.  From bashing America to making controversial references to September 11th, Eminem proves again that he \\"Just Don't Give a ...\\"  When you first listen to the CD, you notice a new style of beat.  Eminem seems to have chosen to use rugged and deep beats on this album as opposed to the lighter beats of hie previous two.  Some of the tracks show Eminem's lighter side, for instance \\"Hailey's Song,\\" a song which about his daughter, is very honest and heartfelt.  Thats not to say the Eminem doesn't get his two sense in about some things though.  This slbum is chock full of subliminal messages along with disses galore.
B00005RFAI|4.0|In all hoensty when I first lsitened to this CD I was disapointed. I was like this is NOTHING like &quot;Can't Take Me Home.&quot; But then I took a deeper listen.<br />This cd is full of how Pink REALLY feels and how she feels about the world. And the best part? They are are real feelings because she wrote most of the songs~ Some of the outstanding songs were Don't Let me Get Me, Get the Party Started, Misery, and Lonely Girl. Respect wasnt bad either.<br />All teh songs ahve ther own funkiness to them. Pink is awesome~ Im proud of her new CD~ She took the chance of being different and for all of you who said you hated this cd. Thats ok.. she took teh chance of being difefrent. Some will respect her for it and others will go their own way w/ their opinions. <br />I love this cd and new side of Pink. Shes a lot more sensitive than I thought and shes normal. Just bacause shes a star she still shows that she is a person with real feelings~<br />GO PINK!
B00003CXI1|2.0|The movie itself gets 5 stars for me. However, the special features get negative stars. Either I'm an idiot, or they are extremely hard to figure out. When I go to Diagon Alley,I can't select any bricks. I press my arrow keys and nothing happens. When I tke the self-guided tour of Hogwarts, I press my arrow keys to move me around and nothing happens. Now I know my remote isn't broken because I can navigate through the main menu just fine with my arrow keys...
B00005RFAI|5.0|I've actually had this CD awhile, but I've just now gotten around to writing a review for it.  I also own Pink's debut CD, and the songs on it that I liked I loved, but too many on there bored me.  However, Missundaztood is an amazing album!  She's developed a totally different sound and her lyrics have gone to the next level, giving more thought and more importance to her songs.  There's isn't a song on this CD that I don't enjoy (and that's a rarity...the skip buttons are my best friends, usually).  I recommend this to anyone who liked her old sound, and I also recommend this to anyone who just wants something fresh that's not in the same category as Britney and Christina.
B00006690G|4.0|\\"The Eminem Show\\" is not as mainstream as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". Despite the single, it's a very personal album, showing less gay and celebrity bashing and more his feelings and the meanings of his lyrics. Although he still has  2 or 3 songs that aren't very serious and his skits are just like his old skits, most of the songs have a lot of meaning and are meant to be taken serious. I like this album a lot, although and i don't think it quite met the level of \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\".
B00005NTJM|5.0|This Was - one can only imagine that the title was the roduct of typical Anderson dry ironic wit - 'This Was' Tull's first album - and perhaps they imagined at the time, their last. It was not to be.  Tull keep pumping them out thirty five years on.<BR>This Was tends to be overlooked in the rush to celebrate discs like Aqualung, Thick as a Brick et al - but wait.  Don't dismiss the embryonic Tull.  For one it is the only album to feature Mick Abrams, later of Blodwyn Pig, one of the most under-rated guitarists Britain has ever produced.  Whereas Tull's subsequent work bore the unmistakable stamp of singer/flautist/songwriter Ian Anderson, This Was is a fusion between the Anderson vision and Abrams'.  The result is a raw, woody fusion of rock, jazz and blues.  Abrams' skill is undoubted, Anderson's flute style is in its infancy and has yet to reach its technical heights - but in common with so many first albums This Was is propelled by the self evident energy and enthusiasm of a group of musicians in the studio for their first real attemt at recording (odd singles projects etc aside).  It is that energy that makes This Was so exciting.  Long before Tull became a stadium regular and their creativity became a little coloured by success - they were genuinely leading edge.  Anderson's stage antics and their raw sound got the pop scene of 1968 really excited.  It was a time of unrest and revolution and in their own curious way (they never manned the barricades) Tull Mk I capture that.  After Stand Up, This Was is my favourite Tull album.  Tull for me are about joi de vivre rather than progressive cleverness - and that is as evident here as at any stage of their career.<BR>Jolph
B000062TU1|5.0|IF you don;t have a DVD player, i would get one just to see this DVD. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen for all ages. Whether you are 7 or 700 you should see this DVD!
B000003N7G|5.0|This is the sound of a man lashing out to pierce the human experience and become one with &quot;a love supreme.&quot; Coltrane's saxophone is the cosmic soul, wailing, praying, mourning, praising, encompassing the whole breadth of life and finally curling its notes around you, uplifting you for one moment to kiss the bliss of Oneness. Coltrane is Moses on Sinai, McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones are the launchpad that Coltrane takes flight off of. This album is a religious experience. Fresher than the Bible, and just as holy. Yes, this is a good album.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Critics of this movie get usually harp on its similarity to \\"Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels\\" -- director Guy Ritchie's first feature film. Both have a flashy, gimmicky, rock-video style, Martin-Scorsese-after too much espresso camera tricks and machine-gun editing that often leaves you as dazed as if Muhammad Ali just let you have it with a six-punch combination to the head. They also point out the British fixation on Quentin Tarantino and how both films seem to ape that combination of quirky dialogue, humorously bloody violence, and out-of-sync storytelling that seems to make no sense until the very end, when everything ties up.<br />These criticisms are all accurate and they are also the reason why most critics are fools. They just can't enjoy a movie for its own sake. You could make a number of 'legitimate' criticisms of \\"Snatch\\" -- but why waste your time? This movie absolutely rocks. Everything about it from the cast to the dialogue to the soundtrack fits as perfectly as the well-oiled parts of a brand-new pistol. Not a replica pistol either -- a Desert Eagle .50, to be exact.<br />I'll skip the plot. Other reviewers nailed it. It revolves simultaneously around a stolen diamond and a bare-knuckles boxing match, but the plot is really just a vehicle for A) mayhem and B) Ritchie's terrific cast of characters to do their thing. I am here to tell you they did it. Tip....top.<br />Jason Statham is spot-on as Turkish, the gruff and unflappable boxing promoter whose withering, double-barreled sarcasm is a far more effective weapon than any gun. Dennis Farina and Vinny Jones are also excellent as a vitriolic diamond dealer named Avi and his sword-wielding, Jaguar-driving, Guinness-drinking thug-for-hire named Bullet Tooth Tony, respectively. Alan Ford gives an Oscar-caliber performance (or what would be an Oscar-caliber performance, if the Oscars ever went to the right bloke)as Brick Top, a local crime lord who wallows in his own villainy like the Lanastershire pigs he keeps to eat the bodies of his numerous victims. But the brass ring goes to Brad Pitt as the Irish gypsy Mickey O'Neil, an unwashed bare-knuckle boxing champ who speaks largely incomprehensible gibberish and comes off as a punch-drunk<br />half-wit, but ends up being the smartest guy in the film. Actually everybody in the cast delivers the goods and then some, but my Tam O'Shanter is especially off to Pitt, who destroys any remnants of the pretty-boy image that might have survived \\"Fight Club.\\"<br /><br />The dialogue just crackles. Americans may be defeated by some of the slang, but for the most part Ritchie's characters achieve the very impressive goal of both spitting out tremendously funny, profanity-laden dialogue and always staying in character, something that Tarantino's bad guys never seem capable of doing. Nor is this movie hamstrung by the long, boring, listen-to-my dialogue-isn't-it-quirky-and-original intervals that plagued \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" But comparisons between the two are largely facile. \\"Snatch\\" is not a better-faster-more version of any other movie: it is its own crazy, crooked, wild ride. But who cares anyway? Another Commonwealth boy, Angus Young, once said about AC/DC's music: \\"People always say, 'Those blokes made another album and it sounds just like the last one.' Well, give me more of the same, any time.\\"s he keeps to eat the bodies of his numerous victims.

B00003CXI1|4.0|This is a review of the DVD, not really of the movie.  I thought the DVD had a lot of great extras, although it would have been nice if the deleted scenes could have been watched within the movie, sort of like a special edition.<br />The biggest flaw with the DVD, in my opinion, is that there was not footage of the upcoming Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!!!  I really think WB really messed up here.  Why not give us a glimpse of the next installment?  The movie has to be in at least post-production by now.  I was a little disappointed.<br />Other than that, great DVD, if you liked the movie, you will like the DVD.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I am glad to see Ryan Adams is finding success.  Sure, Gold is a good disc.  Songs like Answering Bell, When the Stars Go Blue, and Wildflower show off his very best.  At times, the action on Gold seems &quot;forced&quot;, maybe trying to be too clever, too eclectic.<br />My biggest hope is that the success of Gold will turn people onto Whiskeytown, just like I hope Wilco's success will turn people onto Uncle Tupelo.  Each of the three Whiskeytown CDs have more of a raw, honest feel than his solo efforts.  Faithless Street is raw, Strangers Almanac is more polished and commercial (and a masterpiece), and Pneumonia is quiet, catchy, and honest.<BR>I think there are plenty more great things to come from Ryan Adams.  Gold may be a little overcooked.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I started watching Moulin Rouge, I thought I was going to absolutely hate it! For the first ten minutes: I thought it was depressing and way to fast! However, when Nicole Kidman had been on the screen for a few minutes I relized that this would be my favorite movie ever.  She has a wonderful voice and Ewan McGregor<BR>is a cross between a pop star and a country music singer (He is sometimes even better than Kidman).  The 4 important words and ideas in this movie are Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things LOVE! If you believe in these things, Moulin Rouge could end up being your favorite movie too!
0446310786|5.0|Please don't let the fact that this book won the Pulitzer Prize and was required reading in your high school freshman English class keep you from reading it. Not only does it encompass some universal human values of compassion and integrity, but it's a great story all to itself, and fun to read. It's told from the point of view of a little girl who likes to run around in overalls, throw batons into the air, make up plays with her brother, and crawl into her daddy's arms at the end of a long stressful day. It's a great read. Really. Try it.
B00006690G|5.0|This is the first Eminem CD that i have ever bought,and i am blown away with how much raw talent he has. I have heard his other albums,and yeah there are some typical Eminem songs on here which no respectable female could like--mainly the track \\"Drips\\" which sings about having vulgar,meaningless sex with \\"whres\\" and catching AIDS from them,etc--cmon,that's horrible song material! But besides that track,pretty much the whole CD is excellent. Eminem flows flawlessly with his voice. Also,he shows his softer side on some of this album. I never thought i would hear him sing these lyrics: \\"Sometimes i think there's nothin to live for,i almost break down and cry.\\", but he did--in \\"Hailie's Song\\". There has never been an Eminem song like that,and it just goes to show that he honestly can create music straight-up from his heart,...Don't get me wrong,the majority of songs on here is the regular Eminem singing bluntly about whatever is on his mind(which he does perfectly),but there is plenty of proof that he is definitely growing as a person,an artist and everything else in between. \\"The Eminem Show\\" is one of the BEST albums of the year...HIGHLY recommended!!
B00006690F|5.0|I got up at 9:00 on the first day and went out and bought this cd and I was so excited. I have eminem's past 2 albums and the d12 cd. None of those even compare to the eminem show. Unlike any other cd all the songs are good. A lot of you people are going to think that without me is the best song don't get me wrong its a great song but cleanin out my closet and white america are about fifty times better. He has the usual skits like steve berman and paul and that is getting kind of lame. This is another cd to not let your kids get a hold of because he uses profane lanquage. He expresses his hatred for his mother when he says \\"You should see Hailie she is getting beautiful but your never gonna see her i hope you die\\". Any how i won't spoil anything else about this cd if you are an eminem fan than by this cd as soon as possible.

B00005B36H|5.0|This is one of the best rock albums I've ever heard.  The vocals are unwaveringly eerie; Keenan's singing is something like shouting in tune (no other voice but his would fit in this band - and it fits perfectly).  The guitar playing is superb - you can really hear every note he plays, even the ones shrouded in a lot of distortion for the sake of a wider variety of effects - and alternates between a kind of slow, awe-struck wonder and very intense, complicated playing that never distances the listener.  Together with the bass playing, the album achieves a lot of really pleasurable harmony (something music this heavy doesn't often aim for, much less reach) in the midst of a structural complexity that keeps bending back on itself in amazing ways (think of an Escher print).  The drumming is incredible; it sounds great in all the ways a drum set is supposed to, all the while wrapping up and containing the continually shifting time signatures, keeping the music tight and even explosive.<br />It's a little weird to hear the guys who used to amuse themselves to no end by making fun of Christianity (mostly with good reason) talking, now, about compassion, healing, endurance, letting go of grudges, etc.  But not once does it come off as forced - in fact, it adds to the unforced weight, the graceful bulk of the music.  And this is a very big ablum - you can hear these guys trying for home runs on every single track.  Not one of them is made for easy digestion - this is heavy metal that requires repeated, attentive listening, and then rewards it.
B00006690F|5.0|Before I bought this I liked Eminem's style and i thought of him as sort of a comical rapper.  In this CD he lets his true rhyming skills show through and talks about real things.  This is the best CD that i own right now.  Its hot.  Every song is hot.  My favorites are Cleaning Out My Closet, Square Dance, Say Goodbye Hollywood,  Soldier, Sing For the Moment, Superman, and Business.  Just about all of them!!!! IF YOU KNOW SKILLS ON THe MIC, Even if you're not an Eminem fan, BUY THIS And you'll be converted.  #1 of 2002!!!!
6305609721|4.0|Although this one was a crowd pleaser, it is definately different than its predesesors, picking up where Star Trek III left off, we see Kirk &amp; Co. getting ready to leave Vulcan for earth in the Klingon Bird Of Prey that they have to shuttle home because of the Enterprise's destruction in &quot;III&quot;, knowing that they face court-martial from the events of &quot;III&quot; they leave only to discover that a probe is interupting earth's atmosphere, &amp; is on the verge of destruction, Spock now recovering fom his experience from the prior installments, discovers that the probe is trying desperately to communicate with the now extinct humpback whales, in order to stop its destruction, they have to time-travel to earth's past &amp; retrieve some humpbacks, this is where the fun starts as we see Kirk &amp; Co. trying to blend in with modern present day-to-day life, that is far more interesting then what they have encountered before, Kirk &amp; Spock get the whales while McCoy &amp; Scotty try to get a glass compartment for their journey back, with Uhura &amp; Checkov getting nuclear power for the Bird Of Prey's prime reactor that was drained during the trip back, they get it from the real U.S.S.

B00005N5S5|4.0|When released in 1984, no one expected this to be a hit, but it definately set the tone for today's action movie, the film begins in the year 2027 A.D. where machines have taken over the world after a nuclear fallout, the human survivors have waged an all out non-stop war &amp; are very close to victory, so the machine's leader Skynet has the best plan of defeat, they will change the past by killing the mother of John Connor, the human resistance leader responsible for their near defeat, The Terminator, A machine disguised in human form is sent to the year 1984 to off Connor's mother Sarah, the resistence leader John then dispatches his own warrior Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the terminator (Scharzenegger), what follows is a cat &amp; mouse game with the Terminator killing anyone that gets in his way, Arnold has a field day as his famous villian, the best scene in the film is when he tracks her down, but his assasination attempt is ruined by Reese who has also tracked Sarah down, in a night club where Arnold &amp; Beihn face off, they escape but are pursued through the end, the future war is realistic in that is shows the consequences of letting computers run our lives, a very close reality, the sequel, although good, really contradicts this one, whereas you know by the end that the future can't be stopped, in T2 however it is , which would make the events of the 1st film non-existent, I don't hate T2, but feel it should have been done differently, this one however more than holds its own as a simple one-time movie, Terminator 3 is supposed to be on movie screens in 2003, hopefully we will see more of the future war, whereas in T2 we only see it in the beginning, which was disappointing.
038533558X|5.0|Three days before her death, my mother told me-these weren't her last words, but they were pretty close-that my brother was still alive...&quot;  So begins Harlan Coben's powerful and harrowing page-turner, Gone For Good.  Narrated by Will Klein, the youngest son of a middle class New Jersey family, now working as the Director of Covenant House for runaway teens, he recounts the story of his popular and charismatic brother Ken, who eleven years ago vanished after being charged with the rape and murder of a neighborhood college girl.  The Kleins always believed in his innocence, and after so much time passed without a word or clue, had come to the conclusion that Ken must be dead.  This all changes when his mother's declaration sends Will on a search of the house where he finds a current picture of his brother hidden in his mother's bedroom.  Now with the help of his girlfriend, Sheila, the love of his life, he's determined to find Ken, bring him back home, and clear his name.  But his plan soon begins to unravel when Sheila disappears, and her fingerprints are found at a grisly murder scene two thousand miles away in New Mexico.  With the help of Covenant House street friends, Will begins to connect the ghosts of the past with the puzzling events of the present, and uncovers secrets, lies, and betrayals that shake the very foundation of his family, and what they thought to be the truth.....  Harlan Coben has done it again, written a suspenseful and compelling thriller that grabs you from page one and never lets go.  This is a novel that has it all...an intricate story line full of twists, turns, and more than a few unexpected surprises;  smart, clever, and eloquent writing with a real ear for dialogue;  and intense, riveting, vivid scenes that set you on the edge of your seat and keep you there.  But it's Mr Coben's original and marvelously well drawn cast of characters that makes this novel sparkle, and he is able to breathe life into even the most minor figures, and bring them to life on the page.  With a stunning climax and very satisfying ending that ties up all the loose ends, Gone For Good is a roller coaster ride of a thriller that doesn't disappoint, and should definitely find its place at the top of mystery/thriller lovers &quot;must read&quot; lists.
B00006690F|5.0|I am one of the people that downloaded the songs a week ago to see how it was, but when I bought the CD today I was a little weary of it because of what I had heard. What a surprise, the cd sounds great with good old fashion Eminem quality, not like the [junk] that I downloaded. Nice beats, cool lyrics and several songs mixed by Dr.Dre this CD is a must for any Eminem fan, and maybe even a new one! Very much recommended.

6305537798|3.0|It was a very interesting adaptation of Shakespeares The Taming of the Shrew, but it's storyline lacked trace of reality. Yes, it's storyline was quite cheesy, and for the most common among other teen movies. Where the geek is never too ugly to become a prom queen, and become girlfriend to the most popular guy in school, of course. The characterization was amazing, the movies characters were very realistic, though that didn't seem to do it. I like the movie a lot, but looking at the bigger picture I realize that it was quite a week storyline, just as a lot of other teen movies have.
B00000K19E|5.0|My wife and I saw this opening day while we were visitng Toronto. I was suprised the theater wasn't packed with all the publicity this film got. Either way, it was a knockout.

Once you watch this movie you'll be forever wondering if we are also part of a matix.
B00006690G|4.0|Dolly Parton once said that \\"The hardest thing for a performer to demonstrate is sincerity. Once you can fake that, you've got it made.\\" Eminem would like us to think he's highly sincere, with his unending self-gratification, but with this third (or fourth, if you count the labored D-12 disc) CD he begins to come across as self-aware. He's the hero of suburban kids everywhere he proclaims in \\"White America\\". He's a ticking time-bomb in \\"Soldier\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\". He's a dedicated father in \\"Hallie's Song\\". He's this, he's that, he's the other and then he's back again. At what point does all this superego hopscotch become valid and at what point does it become the Eminmen Copyrighted Selling Point, that he can summon at will, and will continue to do so for as long as it makes a buck? I ask this because even as you're bobbing your head to the relentless beats conjured by Em and Dre, you'll still be getting the sense of deja vu. It really is the Eminem Show with Em, Mom, Kim, Hallie, Dre, and the nutty cast of characters popping in and out. He's as vocally dexterous as ever, (we could spend all day reciting the witty and memorable lines displayed in just a few songs.) and as I stated, songs like \\"Square Dance\\" and of course \\"Without Me\\" are guaranteed car-radio hits. <BR>It's just this: even hit sitcoms run out of new ideas, and Em is well on his way there; after he gets through ragging on family members, he contrives enemies out of thin air, (MTV tried to shut him down? The Source doesn't respect him?) Worst of all, he's starting to indulge in vulgarity for vulgarity's sake like Too Short or 2 Live Crew with the ultra-misogynistic \\"Drip\\" and \\"Superman\\"; it's not just that these tracks are disgusting, it's that after staking his claim as the ultimate individual, such pandering like this should be beneath him. Those quibbles aside, it's another fun filled hour with MM, and he'll undoubtedly be renewed next season, even if the ratings start to shudder.

B0000634EV|3.0|I was so excited when I heard that a new Down was coming out, however, that excitement set me up for a letdown.  The album is good, it has the heavy sabbath-esque riffs you expect, and Phil is a good metal vocalist.  Its just that nothing really blew me away like the first Down.  In fact, I found myself getting bored with it after a while.  There are decent songs on here, just not enough of them stand out.  It is worth owning for Down fans, however, don't expect it to blow the NOLA release away.
B00006690F|5.0|People were wondering if Eminem could come back with a followup to his Platinum CD \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\" Em does prove that he can with \\"The Eminem Show.\\"  Shady is as shady as ever with hardcore cut to the bone lyrics and thunderous rhythm tracks.  While his latest single \\"Without Me, \\" is already as hit, Em does prove that his serious side will always be there.  With such tracks as \\"Cleanin out my closet,\\" hits close to home and reveals Eminem's true feelings toward his family.  All in all, Eminem is back and hitting hard with this tour de force followup to his already existing legacy
7119005901|5.0|This book is a truly epic tale of ancient civilization. It is a historical fiction of roughly 180-280 AD (the period of the fall of the Han dynasty), with Liu Bei and \\"Peach Garden\\" brothers set as the heros. The plot of this 2000+ page tale centers around the political and military exploits of various leaders of the age. The dissolving the dynastic rule, the rise of warlords, and the subsequent consolidation into three major kingdoms. The story telling is superb, in echoing themes from earlier chapters, and for thematically bonding disparate events and characters. The story also mixes in many different observations into the nature of morality, politics, leadership, and loyalty. This translation seems to be based on the Mao edition, the footnotes are helpful for understanding the historical allusions and identifying where the fiction differs from history. This printing has a fair number of typos, that are sad, but not very detracting from the story.
0140186395|5.0|East of Eden cannot be looked upon as strictly good versus evil, as it appears with Adam and Cathy.  To the reader, Adam appears to be the extreme \\"good\\" while Cathy appears to be the extreme \\"evil\\".  Taken from a different perspective, can Cathy be seen as \\"evil\\" when she does not view herself as being \\"evil\\"? Is Adam \\"good\\" or merely human? Without analyzing the complexities of the language, the story will appear to be solely good vs. evil.  Without the mindset that the characters are either good or either evil, the characters are more believable and realistic despite some of the extremes of good and evil such as Cathy's apparent lack of all the good that people can have.<BR> <BR>East of Eden also parallels the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Abel.  The parallel to the fall of Adam and Eve is quite subtle and not as easily apparent as the rivalry of Cain and Abel. For example Charles and Adam, and Caleb and Aron represent the Cain and Abel pair. Although the parallels do exist and even have recurrences throughout the novel, Steinbeck does not make it the main point of the novel.  The use of these biblical parallels serves as a backdrop to the story.<br />Ultimately Steinbeck shows that people have a choice over good and evil having the choice to be good or to be evil.  As an example from the novel, Cal (Caleb) recognizes that he is evil yet chooses to attempt to lead a good life as portrayed through Aron, his twin brother.
B00005V1Z0|2.0|I give it two stars only because there were some decent action sequences. A lot of the reviewers seem to think that because it's the action genre that we should expect to check our brains at the door, but I disagree. I expected the movie to at least tie together somewhat and not be completely insipid. Unfortunately, it had major major plot problems that just irritated me throughout and in fact made it painful to keep watching, because the plot hole destroyed the credibility of the main character. To explain, Lady Croft (man, that got annoying hearing her referred to so formally all throughout the flick) needs to keep the villain from getting two halves of a pyramid to put together, which will enable him to be essentially master of the universe. So what do these filmwriters do? They have Lady Croft find the first piece of the pyramid fairly early on in the film. That should have been the end of the story, because the villain needed both halves to wreak his destruction. At that point, with one half in her possession, she could destroy it and put an end to the whole thing. But no. She has to go after the second half. And there is never any justification for why she would need to do this. Pointless. Had the writers simply given the villain the first piece of the pyramid, this would have come together decently and actually created some drama. They didn't. It didn't work. And I spent the last half of the film cursing the protagonist for being a complete moron.
B000000LZV|5.0|This CD is in my personal top 10 of all albums, up there with &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot;, &quot;The White Album&quot;, etc... in fact, it's a punk version of &quot;The White Album&quot; becauses it's a sprawling set in a bunch of styles.  This is also one of the best-recorded albums ever -- you can hear what each band member is doing (it helps they're good musicians).  Buy it.
630575067X|4.0|This is a great movie, if it were a stand-a lone film, but it's not, it's part of the star wars series.  It's got great special effects, a descent plot, and lots of action.  Too bad the jar jar binks character was so stupid, and Jake Lloyd couln't do drama if his life depended on it.  <br />Plot - 8/10  This is a descent plot for the first episode of the pre-trilogy.  They use too many big words and government lingo, and most kids under 12 will have no idea what they're talking about.  BUt the trade federation forms a blockade around a small naboo planet.  The queen sends two jedi knights, obi wan and qui gonn to negotiate.  The negotiations fail, and they uncover a plan that has the trade federation invading the Naboo.  Qui Gonn and obi go to naboo, and find aid with the Gungans.  They rescue the queen, and escape the blockade.  Their ship is damadged on their way to coruscant.  they meet young anakin skywalker for the first time, and the rest is history.  <br />Sound - the sound in this movie is great.  Especially during the obi wan and qui gonn vs darth maul lightsaber battle.  The music is the other half that the battle was the best battle yet.  The sound effects were also great, with every lightsaber beam, and laser bolt flying on the screen, it makes the viewing experience a better listening experience too.<br />Acting - bad acting.  Except for darth maul, captain panaka, and Qui gonn.  the rest was all bad. period.<br />Action - this movie delivers a ton of action.  Their are many action scenes.....qui gonn obi wan vs trade federation droids opening, the underwater chase, the naboo ship escaping the blockade, the pod race, and the final four battles.  Naboo fighters vs trade federation ship, darth maul vs 2 jedis, the gun fight inside the naboo palace, and the Gungan army vs the Droid army.  all great action scenese.<br />I just hope attack of the clones will clear up some of the confuscion caused by this movie.
B00003CXSP|2.0|No I take that back it wasn't nuts it was flipping crazy!!  Now I love Silence of the Lambs but this was just God-awful WAY too violent and just flat out gross.  This movie releyed on Anthoney's canabalism to scare the [heck] out of you.  Slience of the Lambs was much more suspenseful from a psychological stanpoint.  If you have any respect at all for the first movie aviod this just terrible sequel.
B00005OAIE|3.0|---so all of the following have been said about mr. john mayer: he's sophomoric, talentless, and too mainstream. let's remind ourselves that an artist's being mainstream is the least important factor when considering one's MUSIC. fans of, say, britney spears (she seems to be popular in these reviews) would absolutely NOT be into john mayer's music. you can't dance to john mayer. you can't &quot;shake what your momma gave ya.&quot; <BR>---john mayer's &quot;room for squares&quot; is an album that could be better, had he nixed the electric guitars and extraneous instruments. if you have ever heard music by john mayer that was straight acoustic, i suggest you listen to the soundclips websites provide before buying &quot;room for squares&quot;. those same songs that are lovely in acoustic form may not be so lovely when put to electric guitar. a good example is &quot;neon&quot;, the song's guitar line sounds intricate, when done on acoustic, but the electric guitar drains the soul of the song.<BR>---john mayer has lyrics many can relate to, you do not have to be prepubescent to know what mayer's talking about. and if you feel you're &quot;too mature&quot; to relate to lyrics of nostalagia, of the pangs of being an outcast, or the impatience of finding the right someone, then move on and find something suitable to your liking instead of spending an exorbitant amount of time criticizing it.

B0000584V3|4.0|There are so few good hard rock bands anymore. With the demise of Primus, I was left with only 3 bands that could get me going -- TOOL, GWAR, and the Melvins. In the span of the last month, I've been graced with hearing two more bands that help me believe the outlook might not be so bleak after all. Opeth is one of them. This CD is the first I've heard from them, but I intend to pick up more of their stuff. I think I'll try them in reverse chronological order, seeing as how I like what they're doing now and I've heard their older stuff is a little different. Now if I could only get to see these guys on tour.<br />Incidentally, if you like this band, or any of the others I mentioned, you should also check out &quot;High On Fire&quot;.
B00000F3KL|5.0|This is a great war movie. Hard-hitting and fast-moving, it concentrates on the impact of hard-core, realistic combat scenes rather than on the 'arty' values of war-movies. The action is almost non-stop. After watching this movie on screen I made up my mind to purchase this video and add it to my collection.
B000067J24|1.0|A talent of mine few people know about is that I can quite easily sit and look at a picture of Penélope Cruz for hours. I can, nearly as easily, listen to her squeaky voice, or observe her quirky ballerina-like mannerisms. This film really put this task to the test. I gave in towards the end and fast forwarded to see how it ended. Aside from beautiful Penélope Cruz, I found this movie simply unwatchable. <br />Penélope Cruz plays a gifted cook from Bahia who suffers from motion sickness. She leaves her cheating husband and moves to San Francisco where she stars in a T.V. cooking show and makes men all over town insatiably hungry. You'll have to figure the rest out.
B0000640SA|1.0|I'd like to begin by saying this is one movie that should not be missed. The film itself is a milestone in the annals of innovative storytelling.<br />HOWEVER, I recommend anyone interested in purchasing this DVD to avoid the Limited Edition at all costs and settle for the original version instead, unless you enjoy spending hours navigating through the pointless and stupid puzzles you are required to solve before you can access ANY of the features on the discs!<br />I've heard some refer to this method as \\"cute\\" and \\"amusing,\\" but I'll wager anything most find it nothing but pure aggravation.
B00003CWNR|4.0|I had to watch this movie twice just to absorb it. Micheal Caine, Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Kathy Baker and the rest of the cast is flawless. The children from the orphanage break your heart, especially little Fuzzy. If you want to see a good old-fashioned drama, this is the one!!! It's sad and uplifting at the same time...definetly worthwhile.
B000059HGY|5.0|This movie does an excellent job of telling the story of the Pearl Harbor attack itself, but what I enjoyed the most about it was how the events leading up to the attack itself were given equal coverage as well.  I enjoyed watching the scenes of Colonel Bratton (E.G. Marshall) and Commander Kramer reading the &quot;Magic&quot; intercepts, as well as the leaders in Washington dealing with Kurusu and Nomura.  Martin Balsam and Jason Robards give excellent performances as Admiral Kimmel and General Short.  The attack footage itself is well-done also.  I've owned this video for several years, and I watch it about every six weeks.  I prefer this movie to &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.  While the special effects of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; are superior, Tora! Tora! Tora! does a much better job of incorporating the diplomatic aspect of the attack as well as the attack itself.  I would rate this film as one of the best war movies ever made.
0688170528|5.0|This book was fantastic! I read this book several years ago and it was spectacular. I have just re-read it and it's as great as I remembered it. It has it all; love, loss, and law! It's incredible and I highly recommend this novel.
0804106304|4.0|I think that we can all agree that sometimes it's nearly impossible to communicate with others, especially, when that person is one of your parents.  If you can imagine an entire book dedicated to the miscommunication between mother and daughter, you would get The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan.  Amy Tan intensely brings to life Suyuan Woo, An-mei Hsu, Lindo Jong, Ying-ying St.Clair (the mothers),  Jing-Mei, Rose Hsu Jordan, Waverly Jong, and Lena St. Clair (the daughters).  All of the listed mothers are Chinese Immigrants. Each voice struggles to choose between a strong Chinese heritage, and the American way of life.<BR>    Although the setting of this story take place in modern day San Francisco, each of the women tells stories. In these mini-stories, Amy Tan vividly opens your eyes. You visit places like China during WW2, a traditional Chinese wedding, or grow up as an immigrant in China Town. The author cleverly describes the setting through what the main character at the time sees.  If it is a flashback, and the character is a child, you instantly see the situation through a child's eyes.  The author's sense of atmosphere is also amazing.  When she describes the wartime tension through Suyan Woo's eyes, you can just feel the tension and uncertainty. One portion of the book, in which I felt that the atmosphere and setting were both excellently described was when Suyan Woo was on a trail to escape a brutal fate.  <BR>  \\"Along the way, I saw others had done the same, gradually given up hope.  It was like a pathway inlaid with treasures that grew in value along the way.  Bolts of fine fabric and books.  Paintings of ancestors and carpenters tools.  Until, one could see cages of ducklings now quiet with thirst, and later still, silver urns lying in the road, where people had been too tired to carry them for any kind of future hope.\\"<BR>    One of the most appealing things about this book was that you got to hear from eight very unique characters, all of which you feel you can relate to.  In this book, due to the number of main characters and sub-plots, there is no set protagonist and antagonist.  One mother could be the villain to her daughter, but to the mother, her daughter could be the evil one.  In other words, this book accurately displays real-life relationships-relationships in which we misunderstand and misjudge people.  I think throughout the story, you do learn a lot about the individual characters.  Yet, these characters don't really change, except for one, Jing-mei Woo.  Jing-Mei, also called June, is the only daughter whose mother is no longer alive.  Through this story, she learns to appreciate her mother's legacy and value the relationship that she and her mother had.  She is the only one who truly changes. <BR>    Each chapter of this book seems to have its own plot, with a beginning, climax, and resolution.  With each chapter you are left satisfied, but curious to learn more.  What ties all of these stories together is the actual Joy Luck Club.  This club was started by Suyuan Woo, who wanted to get together with three other Chinese women to play Mah Jong. The women got together each week, and remained close friends for many years.  I saw frequently that people from the other families would show up in flashbacks of the other women's stories. What really keeps the story interesting is Jing-Mei's voyage to meet her sisters that were left in China many years before.  This mission periodically comes up, and really completes the story.  If you sit back and look at it from a different perspective, you really see the jealousy that exists between a close-knit group of friends.  You see the bragging between the mothers, and a drive to be better than the rest. All this book does is take a slice out of a completely real life situation.<BR>    I found the author's writing style very refreshing. If one of the mothers was talking, the writing would be in broken English, which contributed to the character's voice.  Everything about this piece made it seem real.  The word choice and sentence structure varied with each character.  If that particular character had high English skills, then it would be displayed by good vocabulary and sentence structure.  The author held true to each individual character's voice.  I felt that this author did an amazing job with flashbacks. Perhaps often flashbacks can be confusing. They certainly weren't in this case.  I found the flashbacks to be necessary and crucial to the story.  Amy Tan also vividly described the setting with each new setting change.  With this story, you're definitely not left confused.  I think the reason for having so many unique characters was to give the message that we all in some way have the same problems.  With each family, and relationship, the problem was communication.  Each character was struggling to be heard, just like we all are.  To read this book, you would have to be a reader that is very interested in others' lives, and how we communicate with each other.  This book isn't difficult, and I believe that people of all ages could read it and enjoy.  With that said, I highly recommend this book.  When a book makes me stop and think about how I interact with people and manage my own life, then I know it was worth the read
6305176299|5.0|This is simply a great movie and should definately be added to your collections.  Speed 1 and 2 were both thrill packed, exciting movies with adventure, romance and of course a whole lot of \\"What do you do Jack, what do you do!\\".  Definately a movie worth watching multiple times, and a great one for a surround sound environment for many home theater enthusiasts.  I loved it and plan to purchase Speed 2 on here as well (I was going to get the two pack collection, but speed 2 wouldn't have been widesceen if I recall correctly).  <br />In all, a great movie worth being added to anyone's collection.
0380789035|5.0|Having read Neil Gaiman's Sandman graphic novel series, along with his novels _Stardust_ and _Neverwhere_, how could I resist snatching _American Gods_ from the library shelf the moment I spotted it?  Of course I couldn't.  And now that I've stayed up far, far too late for two nights in a row to finish this dark and lingering masterpiece, I'm ready to say without reservation that it's thus far my favorite of all Gaiman's text novel-format works.<br />This is truly an ambitious story:  like Sandman, it deals with issues vital to humanity, and though the natures of religion and belief are its gist it's by no means limited only to those things.  It prompts one to consider what it really means to be alive, what price people might be willing to pay for peace in a chaotic world, whether anything in life is truly what it seems... and despite a number of historical (or faux-historical) anecdotes told as asides to the main story, it never really takes on the tone of a lecture.  Gaiman's art and skill keep the novel compelling and alive, and it can be appreciated both as a philosophical text and as a sheerly entertaining work of modern fantasy.<br />Its size may also work in its favor.  While I've enjoyed the other Gaiman novels I've read, neither of them seemed quite as epic or grand as the Sandman series--of course, neither of them were likely meant to.  _American Gods_ isn't quite on Sandman's scale, but it has a very satisfying sense of depth and weight to it.  Its conclusion was relatively satisfying and for once didn't leave me wishing Gaiman had gone just a little while longer.<br />I would absolutely recommend this book, particularly to those who've read and enjoyed Sandman; however, familiarity with that unrelated series is by no means necessary to understand _American Gods_.  I feel obliged to caution, however, that it does contain scenes with explicit sex, explicit gore, and occasionally explicit disgustingness.  Though such passages generally contribute to the atmosphere of the novel and serve the purpose of the plot, those who are particularly repelled by such things might wish to choose a different Gaiman tale.osphere of the novel and serve the purpose of the plot, those who are particularly repelled by such things might wish to choose a different Gaiman tale.
B00003CX8V|5.0|I'm speechless...this is one of the all-time great movies! Billy Wilder creates a masterpiece that is both a comedy but also a cynical look at business in New York in the '60's. Jack Lemmon is amazing as C.C. Baxter, and Shirley MacLaine lights up the screen as Fran Kubelik! The two of them together have the greatest chemistry; if only we could see that in a picture today. I'm young, but I know a fantastic movie when I see one.
B000050XEI|4.0|The music on this CD is magical, flowing from track to track in ethereal fashion, without even a hint of synthesized fluff.  The sound is more mature, more refined than Watermark, which is still quite good.  But suddenly, unexpectedly, the flow is haulted -- silence at only 34:28, leaving the listener wanting more.  Sure, all things must end, but in this case the end is a bit too soon.
B00006690F|5.0|Great CD, Eminem is trully back with this great hip-hop CD;  would recomend to everyone!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|There isn't enough bad things to say about this movie. It's a &quot;comic&quot; without the &quot;relief&quot; in it. Because this movie is nothing but a comic horror, and a boring one at that. Thank God for Star Wars: Clone Wars, because this pile of junk wasn't the force worthy. Horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible computer graphics, horrible!
B0000399WI|5.0|I do believe that this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. It is an excellent adaptation of a Stephen King piece. A great story, great camera work, great music, great everything. But the main reason why I like this film so much is the excellent performances from EVERY actor in this movie. All the way from Freeman and Robbins to the the chubby guy who gets beat on his first night in. The characters are well developed and the performances are stellar. No doubt a testament to Mr. Darabont's skill as a director.<br />In 1994 I could understand why Forrest Gump got the nod over this film for Best Picture. But as time goes on &quot;Shawshank&quot; gets better every time I watch it. &quot;Gump&quot;, even though it is a fine film, does not.<br />If you do not own this DVD do yourself a huge favor and buy it, or at least rent it. However, It sure is nice to just be able to pull this one out without having run out and get it.
006016848X|2.0|This book was a disappointment.  Though some of the points were valid and the author was very insightful about the point values of large gifts vs small gifts, I felt as though it all boiled down to this: Women, put the needs of the man before your own.  Let them go crawl in their caves until THEY are ready to deal with you or any issues that might need to be discussed.  How convenient for the men and how sad that it didn't encourage the men to deal with issues.

B0000542D2|5.0|Wowww  I'm from Mxico and when I saw for the first time the movie in the theater I was amazed. Perhaps having Beatles songs it has John,George,Ringo and Paul acting. <BR>With funny dialoges and comic scenes it is one of the many master pieces of The Fab Four.<BR>They have to be........THE BEATLES (Yesterday,today and forever)
B00003CXSP|5.0|This film is pure genius, everything about this movie is GREAT. This is Ridley Scott's MASTERPIECE, in my opinion this is one of the greatest film's ever made. The direction is so good and the script is so well writen and so rich with dialogue it's brilliant, the cast and acting is so perfect and the look of the film is breathtaking. The editing on this film is so great that all the scenes blend together perfectly with excellent pacing. The musical score is beautiful and haunting. This film should have won the Oscar for best picture cause it's pure perfection.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I can't even begin to say how much I love the movie \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\". I heard all the great reviews and decided to check it out myself, and what can I say? I totally LOVED it. John Cameron Mitchell is so awesome, he should have won every award out there for it. The music is awesome as well. Even my 5 year old neice loves to sing \\"Sugar Daddy\\" and \\"Wig in a Box\\". I only wish I could have seen it on Broadway! Check out Hedwig and the Angry Inch!!! You will love it!!!
0064407667|5.0|Do you like to read books that end with \\"happily ever after\\" or \\"and they road off into the sunset never to return\\"? Well, if so, you may be better off reading another book, as the author put on the first page. Why, probably because this book has neither a happy beginning nor ending. Misfortune starts to lurk the three Baudelaire children from chapter one when they're told by Mr. Poe, while at Briny Beach, the news of their parent's death. Sadly, for the children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, their mansion also perished. The Baudelaire children, with no other place to go, lived with Mr. Poe and his family. However, they moved again when Mr. Poe, following Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire's wills, found them another place to live at their relative, Count Olaf's, house. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny begin to cheer up considering that they have a new place to live without Mr. Poe's irritable sons, Edgar and Albert. Plus, their neighbor, Justice Strauss, has an amazing library and is very pleasant. Though, despair and tragedy still lurk at their heels as they start to suspect Count Olaf when they uncover his plot to steal their fortune. Will Violet, Klaus, and Sunny be able to stop him? Before you decide, remember that the book is truly unpleasant and defiantly does not have a happy ending.<br />My favorite parts of The Bad Beginning are when the Baudelaire siblings encounter Count Olaf's theater troupe. I like these certain parts because the troupe is so evil and vile, including Olaf. The actors are so rigid and are masterminds when it comes to being deceitful. The hook-handed man is my favorite. When the author described his character and even his tone of voice when he and Violet met on top of the tower it sent shivers down my spine. I knew that I would never want cross his path and get him upset. I wouldn't know what to do if I was one of the Baudelaire siblings and I raised his temper.<br />Again, like others, I liked this book because it didn't end with \\"happily ever after\\" or witha puppet turning into a real boy. This book was a change for me, since the disaster that haunted the orphans didn't seem to vanish. Though, I don't think it totally surpassed Harry Potter because I like to read about magic and the fairy tale, princess life. However, both books seem to not acquire a happy ending and have intense cliffhangers, but I'm still in the Harry Potter favor because Harry still seems to have fun and is not continuously depressed while attending Hogwarts. Though, if you like to read short books and aren't into the magic craze I'm sure you'll enjoy The Series of Unfortunate Events.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I was really rooting for George and Co. in anticipation of this long-awaited prequel, but like many Star Wars fans I found the dreadfully-titled Phantom Menace to be little more than a sophisticated children's movie. This problem is partly due to the age of the protagonist, although not enough effort was made to maintain the adult interest factor.<br />The original Star Wars trilogy was intelligently written, brilliantly cast, produced and directed, and hardcore enough to appeal to anybody of any age. Yet in spite of a good cast, which includes such giants as Sam Jackson and Liam Neeson, Phantom Menace (what a ghastly Fifties pulp title) cannot hold a candle to the original movies.<br />This quality DVD is worth having for the sake of completeness, especially in view of the fact that Episode 2, the almost as weakly titled Attack Of The Clones, appears to be far more like the original Star Wars. More combat, more edge and more maturity.<br />I wish I could be more postive about this, but there was more Menace in the Mel Brooks spoof.
0060005424|5.0|This book was the best book that I've read all year!  I read all 700 and something pages in two days.  It has the perfect mix of scary parts and other exciting parts.  I didn't ever get bored.  onece I started it I couldn't stop reading!  It's really great!
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Tomb Raider is a fun action movie despite the bad director awful script and bad editing. This movie is just fun to watch and more fun to watch Lara Croft. I have yet to like one of Simon west's film's until this one I guess it's just because I like the video game and I like Angelina Jolie and the action sequences are so good. If you are a big action movie buff you must own Tomb Raider.
B00006690F|5.0|I had very very high expectations for this CD because of the vast creativity of the previous album, and let me tell you that it surpasses them all and then some. There is not one bad song on this album and there are several great songs. No two songs sound the same and there are very unique elements in some of the songs that just make you smile and say \\"wow\\". The rhymes are once again epic, and they flow sow easily. The difference between Eminem and other rappers is that his lyrics are sophisticated and witty, almost like poetry. Sometimes i cant help but wonder if Eminem is really a scholar in disguise. In  my opinion, this CD is oriented more towards his life experiences with his mother, father, ex-wife, and daughter which make it deeper and definitely worth the money. he even tries to sing in this album, and it doesnt sound half bad!<br />p.s. this album will take the \\"album of the year\\" grammy, and dont expect another Steely Dan upset!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was first turned on to this album when I heard her do Hank William's &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; on the radio.  Beautiful, yet tastful reharmonizations are hard to find these days.  I like the relaxed mood of this album.  This is a &quot;jazz&quot; vocal album as much as many others.  There is some improv, but not as much as on an instrumental album.  Besides what else would you call it?  My suggestion to those who have criticism is to quit comparing Norah Jones to other vocalists and listen to her objectively.  I feel that she has excellent intonation and a uniquely breathy voice that reminds me of some popular contemporary R&amp;B singers.  I find a vast amount of variety on this album from the song selection alone.  Again, I like the relaxed tempo throughout.  Sometimes it is just irritating to have too much tempo change in an album.  The caliber of musicianship is very high too.  I love to hear these side musician's doing material outside their usual ways.  This album is subtle.  I guess some folks don't get subtlety...  Keep up the good work Norah!
B000062TU1|5.0|I actually saw this movie before I had read the books. I admit I didnt understand the whole harry potter big deal thing but I really liked the movie a lot!!!! I'm usually not into the whole magic weird wizards movie. but i liked the fact it was eery and dark and It had a cool atmosphere about it. Wow wasnt this an awesome movie? I loved it a lot! I think Hermoine did really good so did Professor Dumbledore. This movie was the best of the year by far. Totally worth buying the first day it comes out on dvd plus its loaded with extras. So I hope all of you guys go and rent Harry Potter doesn't matter if you've never read the books its funner that way actually after I saw the movie I read all four books ok enjoy :)
B00006690F|5.0|The CD is Raw(That means good). Eminem is mostly talking about what happen to him rescently, the lawsuit that was thrown at him by his wife. Eminem is just getting everthing that made him mad off his chest on his CD.
B00005QFE5|4.0|This latest from Zhang Yimou is a gem. It doesn't carry a philosophical weight of his other offerings, but the emotional content and carry of the film is true and beautifully conveyed. Zhang Ziyi, the girl from Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger...' is perfectly cast as a stubborn girl who will not give away even an inch to get her love. She plays the part of the narrator's mother to perfection, with equal measure of sweetness, whimsy, and fiery temperament. <br />The film starts with a man who returns to his backwards village to bury his father. His mother wants him and other people to bring the body back from the hospital on foot, carrying the coffin, so the deceased won't forget his way home. As the man contemplates this decision, he reminisces about the courtship of his mother and father.<br />The movie is one of the most gorgeously shot films in recent years. You won't forget many of the scenes. The climactic sequence towards the end, when the mother runs toward the school, hearing her son, remembering her dead husband, is stirring and very moving. This is a work of a virtuoso filmmaker.
B00006690F|5.0|Shady's back, back again!  I went out and bought this CD ..., and I cant stop listning to it.  Without me is a great song, as well as Say Goodbye to Hollywood, Cleaning Out My Closet, and the song that has the \\"Dream On\\" tune.  I also like Hallie's Song, where he is acutaly singing, not just rapping. People probably wont be as shocked by the lyrics on the Eminem show, as much as the Marshal Mathers LP.  Another great CD for Mr. Mathers.  I can't wait for the movie!
0201633612|4.0|This is a book where very simple concepts are explained using the most difficult to read English you can imagine. You will need to re-read every sentence at least twice. Every time I get done reading about certain pattern and understand what the author is trying to explain I wonder why it was explained using such arcane sentences.<br />Other than that it's a great book for anyone who is designing large apps and is looking for organization and design efficiency.<br />I disagree with a reviewer who said that patterns are not applicable to web-based apps. I see a lot of uses that I am going to utilize in the coming projects.
B000002H3E|5.0|Although it is not as in-your-face tough as \\"Tooth & Nail\\", Dokken's \\"Under Lock & Key\\" is a step forward for the premier 80's Hair Metal band. This album displays talent that every band should have. The songs are perfectly written with extreme heart and soul, but also enough edge to satisfy any headbanger's craving for hair metal.<BR> From the first notes of \\"Unchain the Night\\" to the screams of \\"To the Livin' End\\", this album contains everything that an 80's metal album should have: Soulful vocals, smooth bass, thunderous drums, and a virtuoso guitarist....This album has all of that....and more. This is absolutely the peak of their career and this album is really the best of it's kind. I would consider this album to be one of the top 10 80's metal albums.....ever. If you love 80's metal, don't overlook this one...Get it!!!!!!!!
B00000IQB7|4.0|As some others have said, &quot;My Science Project&quot; is pure 80s absurdity - but that doesn't make it a bad thing. With surprisingly high production values and a premise that was every misfit's high school dream (as in saving the day, getting the girl, and winning the respect of your peers), it's hard for an 80s-born nerd such as myself NOT to enjoy it. Since I was a kid I've always had a soft spot for this cheesy flick, and it hasn't changed with time. It may be too campy for much of today's audience, but it's jam-packed with that nostalgic 80s flavor and some really fun moments.
0060977493|5.0|If you expect a candy coated fantasy story where everything comes out allright in the end - then run away. If you expect a book which will put everything into plain English and use correct grammar - then run away. If you expect a story that is morally and religiously proper, again, I plead you to run away.<br />However, if you are inclined to read books which portray the reality and darker side of every society, then read this. I grew up in this land where Ms. Roy's book is set. What she speaks of is the truth, which apparently, many reviewers can't handle. Her style of writing is beautiful, unique, fragmented, and awesome. Time jumps back and forth, but any reader who's paying attention can easily keep track.<br />I enjoyed this book partucularly due to Roy's inventive and creative style of writing and her sense of irony. At times the writing is so stunning, it'll make you wonder how a person learns to be so fluid and imaginative.
B000003C51|5.0|This is simply stupendous guitar rock music.  I decided to buy it when it was first released, after hearing about 20 seconds of &quot;Ice 9.&quot;  I turned the car around and headed for the record store, fearful the radio people would not tell me the name of the artist or the song, and I would not know what I was seeking.  Fortunately, the DJ imparted that info after the song ended, and I was able to buy the record within half an hour of hearing the first great snippet.<br />I called a friend to tell him about it, and he was arrogantly dismissive.  &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; the guy said, &quot;Jeff Beck has already done a lot of the same sort of stuff.  Satriani is only popular now because he's new, and he has an exotic name.&quot;  And so on, and so forth.<br />Well, folks, THAT was a bunch of nonsense.  My friend was just jealous, he was a failed rock guitarist.  Satriani rocked out on &quot;Surfing With The Alien,&quot; which only prompted me to buy his next one, &quot;Flying In A Blue Dream,&quot; the very day it was released.<br />Buy them both TODAY, and rock out !
B000002JS6|5.0|In a nutshell, not much can really be said about this album to describe how great it really is. ... This album sounds just as good today as it did back when it was released in 1980. It still holds it's own against the newer generation of hard rock bands. If you don't have this album, you must be from another planet or you should be ashamed of yourself. Everyone should have this album in thier album arsenal. This one is definitely a must have!!!!!!!!!!
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is back with the best cd he has put out. This cd is like all the other cds he has put out. He raps about people he doesn't like, like Moby, Jermaine Dupri, and Kim. This cd has Dr.Dre and D-12 on it. The best song on the cd is the one with Dre on it when they rap about Jermaine Dupri. He even sings on one of the songs even though he can't sing at all. Everybody should have this cd.
B00005UW7V|5.0|This is a great film about the power of the love that parents and children have for each other.  It may also be (if you want it to be) about how human beings should not be afraid of creating a race of AIs, who would in every meaningful sense be our children and would love us with the same irrational attachment as our flesh and blood offspring.  That such a film is seen as &quot;sentimental&quot; shows how far Western civilization has fallen into a jaded cyncism about any art or culture that portrays human life as anything other than a meaningless nightmare.  If you don't like this film, I suggest you are a prime candidate to be attending a Flesh Fair some time in the future.
B00000I3JO|3.0|Update - 8/7/12: So, at the time of writing this update, I wrote the original review below ten years ago. In that time, I have warmed to \\"Hats\\" somewhat, although there are things about it that still irk me. \\"Hats\\" does contain at least a few emotionally moving, melodically beautiful songs. My main issue with the album is that there is an overall vibe and sound (partly due to the polished-to-a-sheen production) that at times veers frustratingly close to the kind of MOR dross that I snarkily compared it to in my earlier review. Perhaps I was being a little too harsh in the first review, as \\"Hats\\" is certainly better than the dreck that I referenced. But with \\"Hats,\\" the Blue Nile definitely smoothed off nearly all of the glorious rough edges that made their debut, \\"Walk Across the Rooftops,\\" such a unique, bold, and original album. \\"Hats,\\" as a result, comes off a bit too safe and a wee bit predictable. Despite the lengthy songs that gradually unfold and build, as well as some undeniably strong melodies, you can tell the band is trying to break through to a larger audience by making their sound more palatable, and the album suffers as a result.<br /><br />As far as albums that are kind of similar in sound or mood, I much prefer \\"Song\\" by It's Immaterial. The songs on \\"Song\\" are more moving, engaging, and adventurous than what's on \\"Hats,\\" and the lyrics are far superior. \\"Song\\" is like a \\"Hats\\" for people who like their music to be a little more challenging and original.<br /><br />So, \\"Hats\\" is not so bad (I've upgraded it to 3 stars), but I still struggle with certain aspects of it, and It's Immaterial's \\"Song\\" approaches a similar overall mood with more style, wit, sophistication, and originality.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Original review:<br /><br />Having been most impressed with their debut, \\"Walk Across the Rooftops\\", I was anxious to get my hands on this, their sophomore effort. Sadly, \\"Hats\\" turned out to be truly disapointing. Whereas the first album displayed a knack for constructing moving, melodic pop songs made up of percolating synths and soothing sheets of atmosphere (with some occasional metallic clangs and tension-filled staccato strings), \\"Hats\\" moves things squarely into VH-1 territory, abandoning the minimalist, abstract art-pop for a pretty generic, MOR sound that seems aimed at gaining top 40 radio air-play. Yes, that means what we have here is a batch of songs fit for Corey Hart to sing. The synths still generate an intriguing atmosphere now and then, but never come close to the infinitely more tasteful standards they set with \\"Rooftops\\".<br /><br />If you're looking for innovative, sophisticated synth-pop a la Japan, Bill Nelson, or Talk Talk, get the first album, and avoid \\"Hats\\" like the plague. But if you're looking for something just a fraction more adventurous than your Michael Bolton and Annie Lennox cds, \\"Hats\\" was made just for you.
B000002JS8|5.0|When AC/DC released \\"Highway To Hell\\" in 1979, all hell broke loose....no pun intended. This is absolutely the best Bon Scott era album ever released. As a matter of fact, this album, to me, ranks up there with the great \\"Back In Black\\". From beginning to end, this album displays hard rock that the world was ready for in 1979, and the world still loves it today. Over time, this album has stood the test and just as good today as it did back then. A couple of songs that stand out from this album are \\"Night Prowler\\" and \\"Touch Too Much\\". Actually, this album does not have a bad song on it. So, if you love straight forward, no frills hard rock with an edge and attitude....get this one. It won't let you down.......you will be satisfied!!!!
B000060P79|5.0|I saw these guys in concert a few days ago, and I was completely blown away by their performance.  I really hadn't heard much of them before, but after watching them onstage I bought the cd and had them sign it.  Not only are they awesome in concert, they are also really cool guys in real life.  I totally recommend this cd to everyone who is just looking for some great punk rock music.

They really bring a funny element to the books, they should also with the the movie.

I was disappointed to find the film quite bland &amp; lacked emotion.<br />Majority of the movie consisted of flashbacks which 'SUPPOSEDLY' explained the close ties between the master spy &amp; his protege.

0385503954|5.0|There are so many comprehensive reviews on Atonement, that I will only add some impressions. Reading Atonement was a fairly wrenching experience. Once begun, I was driven to finish. The growing tension of the story made it impossible for me to stop reading until the advent of a new course of action and I was released me until the next time.<br />In the innocence of childhood, precocious talents are encouraged, applauded. But by the next stage of development, adolescents are often capable of spite and revenge, and exhibit a certain primal sense of justice. Things are black and white, not mitigated, by circumstance and inside a clever young mind, a twisted labyrinth of perplexing ideation emerges. Simultaneously the ripe possibility of consequence is irresistible, hanging suspended, the flash of guillotine glinting above the prisoner's exposed, perhaps innocent, neck. When the blade descends, imagination prances about, dressed as truth and clearly believable. The young girl, Briony, is so perfectly realized that I recognized myself in her, caught in the consuming greed for notice, compelling the adults to admit the correctness of her new-found maturity, rather than the unstable perceptions of a child. All is contained in the moment, not the consequences, for Briony is immersed in her own self-importance. She is incapable of perceiving the degree to which lives are altered, incapable of such consideration. I can barely forgive her this hubris, no matter what her age.<br />Two other characters are drastically affected, their lives irrevocably changed: Cecilia, Briony's older sister, and Robbie, grown son of a family retainer. Helpless to change the course of events, Cecilia bitterly carves out a life she can endure, unwilling to meet with her sister for years. Eventually, as Briony truly matures, she begins to fathom the nature of her misdeed and the moral burden she bears. In her guilty angst, Briony is humanized and made available as just another flawed human being. There is an indictment, through Briony, of the class-consciousness that enables accusation and judgment without the need of adequate proof. The lower classes of 1935 London are, in Briony's perception, simply incapable of the finer instincts of her class and therefore culpable by default. Social acceptance by virtue of birth or background creates a false sense of entitlement, eroding the society that gives it credence. By the end, I felt in need of redemption myself. But then, isn't that the point?There is an indictment, through Briony, of the class-consciousness that enables accusation and judgment without the need of adequate proof.

B00001ZSVG|2.0|This appears to be the same CD as London Live '68 with a new title, so don't get both!

B00006690G|4.0|Eminem's back and so are the critics.<br />Actually, this album won't look controversial at all. This is quite surprising but sometimes, the hard, rocking songs on The Eminem Show might sound tiring. Geez, I mean, how many times did Slim Shady cuss his ex-wife, his mom, critics in his albums? Thousands? Millions? Jillions? Nah, I've stopped counting.<br />As far as the lyrics are concerned, they improved somehow (of course it comes with the usual Eminem swearing) than his past albums but heck, the music is mostly nowhere. The first single, \\"Without me\\"'s like a follow-up to \\"The Real Slim Shady\\". \\"Soldier\\" talks about struggling as a \\"gangsta\\".  \\"Say What You Say\\" is another project from the dynamic twosome- Dr. Dre and Eminem. Yet, I think that \\"Forget About Dre\\" is much better. Dissing is one of Eminem's most well-known pastimes so he didn't forget the government and terrorism in his album (check out \\"White America\\" and \\"Square Dance\\") And for some reason, Eminem's not that bad at all. The album isn't all about cussing (Oh, one track will do). It has a tender song for his daughter Hailie. (Hailie's Song) <br />Overall, this 15-track album (which includes 5 skits, btw) doesn't meet the awesome quality from Eminem's sophomore album. But if you're not the ultra-sensitive music listener and detest bubblegum pop, you gotta have this.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The problem with trying to make a good film is that there's so much that can go wrong. No-one starts out to make a bad movie, but keeping control of every aspect of the process would test anyone's strength. <br />Not only do you have to cope with egotistical actors demanding that the part be played their way, and pretentious cinematographers insisting that the entire film be shot looking at the characters' feet, but you also have to juggle callous studio execs whose only intention is to drain the film of all its creativity so as to make it \\"accessible to a wider audience\\",... This is why 1995's The Usual Suspects is such an achievement. Everything about it reeks of quality.<br />Director Bryan Singer had only made one film before The Usual Suspects, 1994's Public Access. Despite only being a mini-budget piece restricted to art house cinemas, it managed to garner the attention of Kevin Spacey, then an accomplished stage actor looking for a break into mainstream cinema. Spacey approached the twenty-six year old and offered his talents, only to find that Singer had already written a part specifically with him in mind. The character was Verbal Kint, enigmatic narrator of The Usual Suspects. There followed a casting executive's dream roll call - Gabriel Byrne, William Baldwin, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro and Kevin Pollak signed on in short order, making arguably the best ensemble cast since Glengarry Glen Ross (in which Spacey also starred). Special mention needs to be given to Benicio Del Toro, whose hilariously erratic character Fenster steals every scene he's in.<br />Singer's long-time writing partner Christopher McQuarrie took a simple premise - five hardened cons meet in a New York lineup - and turned it into a stylish crime thriller of labyrinthine complexity with an ending that would become one of the most startling in cinema history, causing the viewer to reassess their opinion of the entire film in a way that would be emulated in later years by The SixthSense and Fight Club.<br />The Usual Suspects was shot in thirty days on a budget of five million dollars, which was a pittance when you consider that most romantic comedies cost at least twenty. Yet here was a film that did not shy from spectacle, with intense gun battles intercutting incredibly dense dialogue, edited together to look like a blockbuster of ten times its budget. The music, too, deserves special mention, with sweeping orchestral movements giving way to Cuban rhythms and delicate piano, echoing the depth and complexities of the story itself.<br />The film plays out like - and essentially is - a story told by a craftsman. In a nice twist, it begins with the death of the supposed central character (Gabriel Byrne in a wonderfully mysterious portrayal of an ex-con lured back into the game) and the rest of the film takes place almost entirely after the events it depicts. Spacey's character sits in a police office and recounts the story of five criminals thrown together in a lineup, deciding to go into business for themselves, only to learn that their fate is being guided by the hand of a terrifying arch-criminal, Keyser Soze. To reveal more of the plot is to spoil the film; suffice to say, one viewing will not be enough.<br />The Usual Suspects is that rare thing: A film in which no aspect is found wanting. Most movies involve the odd cringeworthy moment; a chunk of cheesy dialogue, a bad performance here or there, an unsatisfying ending - but Suspects oozes  quality in a way that the majority of modern films are not allowed to do, whether because of production companies clouding the auteur's vision, arsehole actors throwing their weight around, or simply bad luck and lack of funds. Perversely, Suspects' low budget could be the main reason for its success, since the filmmakers were given far more free rein to pursue their goals without studio executives breathing down their necks. And it shows. The Usual Suspects went on to garner two Oscars (Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor for Kevin Spacey) and assembled a following of committed devotees.<br />Watch it, be confused, watch it again and love it.
B0000019HU|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time.  Just go buy it.  If you don't like it, you have no soul.<br />The particulars - this is math rock from Kentucky.  If you like Radiohead, imagine that they grew some balls and you'd be halfway there.<br />If you like this, you'll probably like Shellac, Clockhammer, Tar, and a bunch of other bands no one's heard of.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This album, even though it has explicit content, is one that is always fun to listen to.  The song lyrics go with the rythm.  The way that Fred Durst, and Wes Borlin play, like a team, they can make rythm like Mozart.  The way that the bass in always on beat with Durst, it always makes me beat my foot to the rythm.  This album, with its creative title, odd words, explicit content, can grab your attention within the first few songs.  The depressing songs, about girl friends, or the fast rap-rock songs that are energy prevolking, this makes for a good album.  The way that the band can make the tempo rise, and fall, at their own choosing, it makes you feel the emotions that the band once felt, as they made these songs.  The way that the band can draw you into their world is amazing, and because of this, they have made this album great.
B00006690F|5.0|Before listing to this album i had doubts that Eminem could top his previous album The Marshall Mathers LP. The Marshall Mathers LP was my favorite C.D. Every song on it i have listened to hundreds of times. But Eminem is back. The Eminem Show is awsome. I have yet to take it out of my cd player. Every song from Curtians up to Curtains down. Many of his song revolve around his daughter and he seems much more mature on this album. If you like Eminem you will love this C.D. His style has slightly changed on some of the songs but you have all the same general type of lyrics that people have come to love. Buy this C.D.
B000002HPV|5.0|Shorn of the dippy interludes and playful experimantalism of her previous output, Bjork has now fully assumed her mantle as a new age Edith Piaf.  'Homogenic' is actually more coherent than either 'Debut' or 'Post'.  At her best, Bjork is brilliantly adept at capturing a sense of ecstatic melancholy.  <br />'Unravel' owes more to Gorecki than Goldie, with sublimely dolorous strings merging impenetrably into a moodscape of sitars and spiralling harmonies before a church organ gradually pushes the song to a conclusion.  'All Is Full Of Love' is more overtly symphonic, swathes of violins and harps washing over Bjork's epiphanic gurgles, untethered by either drums or bass. <br />Bjork's avant garde sensibility means that this never veers into easy-listening.  Most of all 'Homogenic' is an album of transition.  Many of the songs focus around images of rebirth, &quot;cocoons&quot; and &quot;brand new bodies&quot;.  'Homogenic' has it's little flaws, but it still holds out the promise of new wonders to come.
B00006690F|5.0|The is album is definitley some of Eminem's best work, he is obviously maturing as a MC. He is finally past making fun of pop-related bands, and moved to some more serious issues. This is why this album is better than the Marshall Mathers LP, his last album. The Slim Shady LP is his best album to date, but this one may surpass it.
B00005RFAI|1.0|ah pop. i completely loathe pop. it takes no talent whatsoever. pink is not a &quot; punk rocker &quot; like many of the little teeny boppers think she is.  I'm sorry to say that pink is sadly unoriginal. while she is 10x better than britney (and i emplore her for that) she is still not all that she is cracked up to be. sorry hun!
006441034X|2.0|A review by Chris<br />Sophie's dad was not able to support all the kids in his family so he found some people to take Sophie's sisters. They keep Sophie because she was the oldest and when they die they needed to have some one to take over the hat shop. One day the witch of the waste came and put a spell on Sophie and the only person the could take the spell off is Howl. She goes to Howl and she stays. They go through many hardships. She finds it hard to leave the castle.<br />I only gave this book  2 Stars because the author tells the story in way too many words. I think that the story could have been told in 100 words or less. The plot of the story didn't go anywhere. The story just went on and on.  If you took out all but the last 3 chapters you would get most of the story. The story doesn't progress rapidly toward the climax. The author tell way more details that I think was needed. The conflict do not seem realistic because you can not have a witch come into the store and have her turn you old. The ending of the story has a fairy tail ending because everyone is happy and the bad guys are dead, which is disappointing, I think, in a horror story.<br />I don't recommend this book to anyone because it just goes on and on about everything. If you like reading books the describe every single detail about everything then I recommend this book to you, but If you don't then this book is just a waste of time.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|One of the most charismatic people of the last 30 years finally gets a movie about his life; what a shame &quot;The Fresh Prince&quot; had to portray this hero. The movie falls short to all expectations and for some reason Smith gets acclaim.<br />Ali's life was something else. His life outside the ring rivaled his battles in the ring. The premise of the movie looks good on paper, but many aspects were left out. His encounters with Joe Frazier in and out the ring was for some reason excluded from the movie. Ali's rival WAS Joe Frazier.<br />Will Smith was decent in his imitation of Ali. He had the voice down (so does Billy Crystal), but all that weight gaining wasn't enough. His only love scene was with his real-life wife, this is not groundbreaking acting! Smith was good in the boxing scenes, which were better than any boxing-related movie to date.<br />All in all, very disappointing. Maybe there will be a sequel, if there's one for Men in Black, I can easily see one for this flick.
0618002227|4.0|A Review by Jordan<BR>A young hobbit embarks on a journey to destroy the ultimate ring that will release destruction upon Middle Earth if the true owner gets hold of it. The fellowship meets a raider name Strider and he save them from these dark riders who are after the ring. They join up with a dwarf and an elf to make the fellowship of nine.<br />This was a great book with a lot of details and a lot of imagination. It is a book of might and magic, also friendship and the battles against an evil warrior. I enjoyed this book but I didnt like some of the parts where they got into a lot of detail and little actions. I also couldnt fallow all of the different names sometimes, I found myself flipping back and forth though the book asking my self, what was that again, or who is that, but you get a better understanding of the beginning if you have read Tolkiens first book The Hobbit which is kind of the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series.<br />I would recommend this book for those with patience and imagination. If you enjoyed The Hobbit or you like books with wizards, elves, and goblins then you will love this book.
0920236162|5.0|As an active babysitter, I am constantly in search of good books to read to kids. This book was a favorite of mine when I was little, and now that I've rediscovered it, I've read it almost every time I've babysat recently. The story makes so much sense, and for once, the protaganist is a strong female. The kids I read it to have asked me for it so much, I have the book memorized. This is definitely a great choice for any kid's library, and the witty story is just perfect for the 4-9 set. I highly recomend The Paper Bag Princess!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Every hit you can think of is on this CD. It's the quintessential collection of radio hits from the Fab Four. After you listen to the commercial successes of this album, I recommend getting into your groove with your personal and more obscure favorites. You don't have to be a hardcore fan to love this CD...
B000062TU1|4.0|The movie overall was good. The characters were spectacular, matched the ones from the books perfectly. The storyline could have been fixed a bit, they messed up and changed the whole detention scene with Norbert, they didn't even show them taking Norbert to tower, they had the wrong chars in detention, small in the book but still a crucial part. That's why I took away a star. Other than that it was EXCELLENT the special effects blew me away, and the likeness of the chars was perfect. The dining hall is SO awsome looking. Well thats all I have to say, and I liked it so much I'm getting it come the 28th, two more days! CAN'T WAIT!
B000002UAR|5.0|&quot;Revolver&quot; is unquestionably one of the Beatles' best, if not the best. The only gripe I have with it is that &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; (incredible song with Ringo's best drumming ever, and reversed tapes of the Beatles singing at the end) were not included as bonus tracks, because that would make this masterpiece even better.  Onto the individual track reviews:<br />1 - Taxman. This song is one of Harrison's best. His sarcastic sneering here is a welcome change from the brighter fare we usually get from him. Paul is the lead guitarist for this one.<BR>2 - Eleanor Rigby. This is a classic. Nothing I could really say about it.<BR>3 - I'm Only Sleeping. The first thing we get from Lennon, whose output was rather sporadic throughout 1966 and 1967 compared to that of McCartney's. This is very good, as his vocal is rather desperate and the subject is too.<BR>4 - Love You To. Rock's first real raga - &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was only a taster for this. Harrison's sitar is marvelous.<BR>5 - Here, There And Everywhere. Another McCartney classic here, on the level of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;.<BR>6 - Yellow Submarine. Ringo's lone vocal on the album is a classic. Beautiful.<BR>7 - She Said She Said. The lead guitar here is brilliant - literally. Lennon's vocal is fantastic.<BR>8 - Good Day Sunshine. Marvelous.<BR>9 - And Your Bird Can Sing. See above.<BR>10 - For No One. This is the only song I don't really like. It just isn't as good as what's to come.<BR>11 - Doctor Robert. One of the single most sarcastic songs ever written. Robert Freymann was a New York doctor who prescribed acid and amphetamines for his patients. Lennon was sufficiently inspired. A must.<BR>12 - I Want To Tell You. The fade-in is really cool, and so is the song.<BR>13 - Got To Get You Into My Life. More often than not, most of McCartney's stuff is good, but I don't like this one that much. Better than &quot;For No One&quot;, though.<BR>14 - Tomorrow Never Knows. Almost everything Lennon produced, even though it wasn't as much as McCartney's, was classic during this period. You have to listen to it to understand how incredible it is.<br />Buy it now, or get it burned with &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;. Have fun.
B00005B36H|5.0|Note:  To skip a very wordy, detailed account of how unbelievably solid this album is, skip to the last paragraph.  That, and GET LATERALUS. <br />To start out in a shameless attempt to build credibility, let me start out by saying that I love TooL and all their music.  They are without a doubt my favorite band in the world, and they have made an impact on my life that no other musical entity (in fact, few other things period) have ever made.  I make no effort to pretend that I am their 'biggest fan', but one thing is for certain...I adore these gentleman and the wonderous art they've created for people to enjoy.  To boot, I suggest everyone I meet tries out their music at least once, and thusly, felt it necessary to write a strong recommendation for Lateralus, their most recent (and in my opinion, most compelling) album.<br />From start to finish, I hold Laterlaus as an immaculate album.  I love every second of every single song on the entire thing, and have a hard time picking favorites.  Lateralus was released five years after their previous studio effort Ænima, in May of 2001.  The growth of musical genuis and insight shows throughout the entire album.  Much like Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' and The Who's 'Who's Next' before it, Lateralus is more of a musical experience than just an album.  Even the bizzare anatomical artwork by Alex Gray in the liner notes is amazing (note the three-lettered word written in the man's brain towards the latter pages...'god').  Perhaps this is a precursor to how stunning this album is.<br />It starts out with a heavy, crushing tune by the name of \\"The Grudge\\".  To me, this is one of the best ways to start off an album since \\"Black Dog\\" on Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth studio album almost thirty years before it.  \\"The Grudge\\" builds momentum and excitement, and a trio of mellow songs (most notably \\"The Patient\\") follow this burst of sonic delight, though they do not lose interest, make no mistake.  After this are the twomost widely-recognized single releases of the album at its half-way point, \\"Schism\\" and the coupled pair of \\"Parabol/Parabola\\".  This presents exactly how much fluidity there is throughout the entire album; it flows like a cool river from start to finish, and is just as refreshing.  After that nine-minute explosion of musical bliss, it suddenly sagueways into the angriest track on the cd, \\"Ticks and Leeches\\".  To any experienced TooL fan, it harkens back to the earlier days of their music, with a crunchier, heavier sound that explodes with emotion in a climatic ending.  It is also interesting to note that this is the only song to swear throughout the entire album (doing so only twice, and with subtlety), a severe departure from the earlier, much more explicit days of TooL.<br />After \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" is when the album truly transforms into recorded bliss, for me personally.  There are no words on this planet to describe the feeling I get each and every time I listen to the Lateralus' ninth song, a self-titled one.  To me, it's as perfect as music has ever gotten and ever will.  A truly amazing nine-minute long opus.  After \\"Lateralus\\" finishes, the album begins to settle down into the remaining three tracks of music, originally assembled as one 20-minute long song, and the smooth transition between them still shows:  the soft, romantic \\"Disposition\\", the rhythmic, relaxing \\"Reflection\\", and finally, the intoxicating riffs of the instrumental \\"Triad\\" (named because drums, bass, and guitar are the only instruments used on this one).  The only even minor portion of this album that detracts from an otherwise unbeatable record is the final track, \\"Faaip De Oiad\\", an eerie recording of a paranoid man ranting on about Area 51 and conspiracy theories.  Luckily, \\"Triad\\" has an extra two or three minutes of silence before track 13 begins, so you can simply turn off the cd player and enjoy the rest of beautiful album you've just experienced.<br />Maynard James Keenan, AdamJones, Justin Chancellor, and Danny Carey are, in my humble perspective, four of the most talented musicians to have recorded music in the past 50 years.  There's no doubt in my mind that anyone could benefit by inducting themselves into the world of TooL.  Some old-school fans did not enjoy the evolved and matured sound that Lateralus brought, and even gave up the band entirely because of it.  I can see why...it is a pretty obvious departure from what an accustomed fan would be used to hearing from such an outstanding band.  Ænima was such an amazing album, it may have seemed impossible for them to beat...but for me, they did just that, and so much more.  I'd hesitate to say Lateralus is my FAVORITE album on the face of the Earth, but I'd be bold-faced lying if I said otherwise.  It's just amazing, every part of it.  Danny's drums are both hypnotic and brilliantly creative, unlike any others I've ever heard before him.  Adam's guitar riffs are built to weave in and out of the entire album, and the solos are equally well-constructed.  Justin's basslines are just incredible, and play an amazing role in every single song (they're really unbelievable, no kidding).  Maynard's singing does not take center stage on this recording, but his presence is still as strong as ever, and his vocals have even improved from the high plateau they once rested on.  His lyrics are emotional, intelligent, and sometimes hauntingly insightful.  I really enjoy the more optimistic turn their message has taken on this record, without losing any of their hard edge in the process.<br />In short, if you're even debating purchasing this album, do it.  Do it right now.  Since buying it the day it came out last May, there have been, AT MOST, a total of 20 or 30 days I haven't listened to at least a few songs off of Lateralus sometime throughout the day.  It's really that good, no kidding.  You will not regret this.  TooL is not just metal, they're not just rock, they're not even just music or art...they're something more.  Something I don't fully understand.  But for me, that's part of the great allure and brilliance of what they're doing.  And I love every second of it.  GET LATERALUS.
B00006690F|5.0|I recently bought \\"The Eminem Show\\". Actually this morning. I hadn't heard any of the songs yet, and full og expectations I inserted the cd into the player. You get a little skit when the curtains go up, and then the song \\"White america\\" starts. The song is full of hate an feelings that you get the feeling of right away. The album is full of lyrics and beats which will make you listen to it over and over again. In the middle of the cd the now familiar song \\"Without me\\" starts, and later the song \\"Hailies Song\\" gives you something you aint heard before. Eminem sings the first to verses plus the chorus. In the end of the album comes \\"My dads gone crazy\\" which is one of my favorites. Hailie participates on the chorus of this song. In my opinion is this cd well worth buying. Go get your own copy, you won't regret. I got the special edition with the DVD. I haven't seen the Dvd yet, but I will as soon as possible.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I honestly cannot believe a band that started out their career with a solid (though not outstanding) album like 3 Dollar Bill, Y'all has fallen so far so quickly.  In a way, it's really a shame...but anything that will get Fred Durst off the airwaves quickly must be a good thing, and the serious lack of emotion, talent, and any genuine music on this album is sure to do so.  If you're considering buying this album, I have some alternate bands that you might enjoy.  Trust me, I'm trying to help you save money and develop some good taste on this one:<br />NU-METAL:<BR>TooL<BR>Rage Against the Machine<BR>Deftones<BR>Sevendust<BR>Mudvayne<BR>Slipknot<BR>At The Drive-In<BR>System of a Down<BR>A Perfect Circle<br />GRUNGE/ALTERNATIVE:<BR>Nirvana<BR>Pearl Jam<BR>The Smashing Pumpkins<BR>Soundgarden<BR>Alice in Chains<BR>311<BR>Incubus<BR>Green Day<BR>Jane's Addiction<BR>Primus<BR>Red Hot Chili Peppers<br />CLASSIC ROCK:<BR>Led Zeppelin<BR>Pink Floyd<BR>The Doors<BR>Black Sabbath<br />Please, try out some of these bands if you're really debating over this Limp Bizkit purchase.  I promise, you won't regret it two years from now when you're enjoying some more grown-up tastes and refined music.  Don't be a fool, listen to TooL.
B00006690F|5.0|I haven't got nothing else to say than this is a must buy. The Album gives you all new material of Eminem as you've never seen him before. Its well worth the bucks.
0451527712|5.0|This book is a great read.  The main character is not the monster, but the scientist Victor Frankenstein who creates him.  The story is told from his point of view, and reads wonderfully.  It's a bit like a journal, beginning with a line something like 'I was born in..', and truly can be called a 'story'.  It is not what I expected, not as scary as I thought it would be, and the monster is very different to the typical image most people have of him.  Although, however, the author leaves a lot about his features to the imagination.  The story takes place in Switzerland, England, the Arctic, and other places around Europe.  Mary Shelley paints a beautiful canvas through her descriptions of mountains, rivers, the sky and sea, the sun and the moon, castles, towns and villages, relating human emotions to them.  In different parts of the story, both Victor and the monster spend days and weeks in isolation to dwell on their troubles.  Nature plays a role and has an effect on their thoughts and emotions.  The monster often sees the sun, the shade of the trees, and songs of the birds as his only companions.<br />The monster torments Victor by murdering those close to him.  The author leaves you to decide on these events, and sometimes you sympathise with the monster, sometimes you cannot accept any excuse for his misdeeds.  The victims are as innocent as can be and poor Victor has to bear so much grief, but the monster is alone and repulsed by the whole of mankind.  Both creator and creation suffer.  I won't dwell on the themes of these points as I'm sure other reviewers can do better, I'll just say the book is wonderful.  Read it if you like good stories with a nice unhurried pace, and if you don't mind getting a little depressed.  And, even if you do mind, read it anyway, it's such a short book.
0140157352|5.0|The authors present a clear methodology for any kind of negotiation. I liked the book in that it has just the right amount of explanation for every topic. The presentation is clear and concise. <BR>It is not only the way it is written, but the methodology really works. I found myself using its principles (\\"Being soft on the people and hard on the problem\\") with great results, even before I had finished the book!<BR>I truly recommend it. It is a mind opener for all of us with no previous knowledge on negotiation.
B00006690F|4.0|This C.D. takes Eminem off his pedestal everyone trys to put him on; and puts him in his own class of music. This is the ONLY artist and album anyone should be compared to, it even tops the Marshall Mathers LP. This C.D. has a great set of openeing tracks, with nice flow of music. It really sets standards by the even flow of heavy and light music. I would pay twice the MSRP to buy this album, it's that good! My favorite track would be #2 White America. This album shows up everyone who thinks they can emulate Marshall's style, this is the one and only Eminem Show.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I first heard this CD when my Girl Scout troop talked me into playing it while we were driving to an event.  As a fan mainly of blues I cringed as it came on the stereo but was amazed at how much I enjoyed the songs -- especially &quot;Just Like A Pill.&quot;  So I bought the CD and was knocked out by &quot;Misery.&quot;  I hope Pink leaves the hip-hop/girl singer stuff behind and concentrates on blues.  Her voice is incredible and she has the potential of being the next Bonnie Raitt.
0805066691|1.0|I suppose Dee Brown is not to blame; after all, he subtitled this book &quot;An Indian History of the American West&quot;. That pretty much says it all for this one-sided, biased, presentation of the clash of cultures which inevitably would result in the extermination of one or the other. If attaining victimhood and sympathy for Indians is the goal, this book succeeds; if the painful truth regarding the bloody massacres perpetrated by both sides is the goal, try a balanced account such as Utley and Washburn's &quot;Indian Wars&quot;. One reviewer stated his desire that this book be made required reading in schools and colleges...unfortunately, that is the case, it's only too bad that no corrective, balanced account is also made required reading.
048622709X|2.0|Certainly not for helping you learn to draw hands!  I bought this book to help me to understand the difficult anatomy of the hand, but it's just a collection of very rough line sketches reproduced on a small and grainy scale, with basically no instruction.  There's no denying Bridgman was a master, but I can't get practical information out of his loose sketches.  Sometimes I can't even tell what position a hand is in, much less use it as a reference.  A book of photographs, or a drawing tutorial, would be a better choice for someone at the beginning or intermediate level.  I haven't found a whole book devoted to the hand yet, but the few pages of information in &quot;Drawing the Head and Figure&quot; (ISBN 0399507914) are fifty times more useful to me than this book.
B00005JKCF|4.0|To think, I almost avoided this film because of Ebert and Roeper's review. What a mistake that would have been! <br />An action film with an actual story that makes sense, has character development and heart (something Lucas' films seem to be lacking lately). Imagine that!<br />My only slight critcism would be the cheesy costume worn by the Green Goblin (It looks like something out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.) and his lack of character development. As a villian, he could have been explained a little more thoroughly. He's portrayed as a Jekyl and Hyde kind of personality. It works ok, but could have been stronger.<br />And, I wouldn't recommend taking children under the age of 15 to see it. Some of the \\"cartoon\\" violence is rather graphic (I had to close my eyes a couple of times) and totally inappropriate for youngsters. Frankly, I was disgusted at how many parents had toddlers in the theater. Shame on you!<br />Other than that, it's a great flick. Guys, even your girlfriends will like it. Trust me.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD is magnificent, since the very first second till the last track. No weak track: all of them are extremely beautiful, very melodic and Thom Yorke's voice is absolutely stunning. I couldn't choose one track. As a matter of fact, I always listen to it from the beginning to the end. However, some rock purist that loved The Bends may dislike this as too mellow. To me, it's the best radiohead album ever and in my Top 5 albums ever.
B000002KHB|5.0|Deep Purple were always one of my favorite bands from their early days when I first heard &quot;Hush&quot; on the radio. &quot;Machine Head&quot;, their third l.p. with Ian Gillian, Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover, Ian Paice and Jon Lord is their best effort to date. There isn't a bad song on this album - period. This is the quintenssial rock album! Blackmore's guitar riffs are awesome as are Jon Lord's keyboard playing. Ian Gillian has got to be one of rock's best vocalist along with Zeppelin's Robert Plant. This band had such talent, it's unfortunate that this lineup didn't record more in the 70's. Eventually Gillian, Glover and Blackmore left the group and replacements were made, but the classic line up in this album will always be what made Deep Purple what they were - one of the world's best (and loudest) rock bands ever. If there's one rock cd you buy from the 70's this should be it.
B0000668IF|5.0|I thought it would have been impossible to compose a new album as good as Play. It was: this is far better. It's definitely Moby's career highest point and it's one of my favourite album ever. I own about 2000 cds. In the last weeks I only listen to this one. All the others disappeared from my mind. Five stars are nothing. This CD deservers at least 10.
B00005YW4H|3.0|When I heard the first single from this album, I was pretty much hooked into buying the CD.  However, after sampling the entire project, I came away feeling like it was good, but not THAT good.  First, many of the songs are so short, by the time you get into the flow, it's over.  Second, Norah Jones seems to be finding her niche as a songwriter and when she does, longer and more complex songs will emerge.  In the meantime, this CD is a good time if you are hanging out with a significant other or just cleaning up around your place.
0140177396|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" was about two friends George and Lennie, who are the main characters. Both were traveling in southern California looking for work. While traveling they would have quite an adventure. One of the major problems between the two is that Lennie is simple-minded and touching things, like women, and their clothes. Lennie had no control over what he did sometimes. He would do things like tell other people about George and his future plans about buying their own house. Of the two I liked George.<BR> George is very short-tempered. He would yell at Lennie and hit him to make him remember and understand things he would tell Lennie. When they were at the river in the beginning George was scolding Lennie about not drinking water that wasn't running and when in trouble to come back by the river and hide in the bushes. Lennie was no smart man, but he tried to listen to George. I remember I would sometimes yell at my little brother because he would do things he had been told not to, but did anyway, like going outside without asking for permission. My little brother wasn't dumb but just wouldn't listen sometimes. I would yell at him not to be mean, but for his own good. Just like George is to Lennie.<BR> After reading this book I thought it was good. Good because of how the author started and ended George and Lennie at the same place, which was unique. The two friends were in a forest with different types of animals and a river and at the end they came back because Lennie got into big trouble and went to go a hide. The most interesting part was when Curley and Lennie were fighting. At first, Lennie was getting beattened pretty badly and then all of a sudden Lennie let out his anger. Having a child-like mind Lennie was unaware of his powerful strength. The only part I didn't like of the book was of how Lennie talks about rabbits too many times. That is what I would change about the book if I were the author.<BR> Since I like the book I would like others to read it aswell. This kind of a book applies to all. It can also teach kids that they can be friends with anyone no matter what kind of a person they are.

079284632X|5.0|Alright, this movie is completely disgusting and disturbing. But it's just got so much energy and power. It teaches you how horrible some people can really be but it is a great movie. Now, lets talk about this cheap, piece of junk version that MGM released. Mostly everyone has heard of Vestron's 82 minute version. Well, this MGM one is even more cut then taht one! Sure it's 82 minutes, but it's missing a few seconds that the Vestron version had. Also, the picture seems more zoomed in so you loose some information from some scenes. But again, THERE IS SOME EXCELLENT NEWS!!!! MGM IS RELEASING A REAL UNCUT VERSION ON DVD ON AUGUST 27!!! It's very uncut and Wes Craven has confirmed it. It's not the full 91 minutes though because when Orion, the company it was originally owned by, went bankrupt, some fottage was lost. But the DVD is more uncut then the R2 DVD. It's rumored to be around 88 minutes! And it has a commentary and featurettes. Plus outakes. Amazon also has it to preorder!! If you don't believe me, see for yourself!
0452282152|4.0|Finally,a writer who doesn't overwrite! Ok,I actually wanted MORE detail as the subject was so interesting. Having been a fan of Vermeer's work,even before reading this book.I felt the&quot;story&quot; behind this painting,although fictionalized,seemed very plausible. Griet is both naive and very intelligent at the same time for she recognises Vermeer's genius. The day-to-day life of the household was also very authentic-feeling; Ms. Chevailer  captures the drudgery of being a maid in a realistic,matter-of-fact way. You can see why this girl was willing to pierce her own ears so she could be in the painting,if only to escape her dreary,monotonous life for a brief while. A fine portrait about a famous portrait.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I highly recommend Spiderman.  Hollywood did something right for once and Sam Raimi was the director to do it.<br />Tobey Macguire is perfect as Peter Parker.  A bright but somewhat shy and insecure orphaned teenager being raised by his aunt and uncle.  In fact it's doubtful anyone could have played the role better than he.  The action scenes are well done but the movie is at it's best while it shows Parker coming to grips with his powers while at the same time coming to grips with being a teen.  Raimi stays true to the original Marvel storyline with great effect.<br />William Defoe is very good as the Green Goblin.  Some have claimed his role is less than stellar but I disagree.  In typical Marvel fashion even the bad guys has some humanity as in the last scene featuring the Green Goblin (I won't give it away).<br />The absolute best supporting role is that of the newspaper editor played by J.K. Simmons.  If Macguire's own role wasn't so well done he might have stole the show.  Cliff Robertson does a fine job as Parker's uncle and Kirsten Dunst is the love interest MJ.<br />All in all this is a surprisingly entertaining flick.<br />Highly recommended.
0064407667|1.0|I agree completely with the review of A Reader from Los Altos -- I read this book and was deeply troubled at the message it sends kids.  Specifically, it tells them that their parents and other adults are entitled to do \\"whatever they want\\" to kids, including life-threatening physical abuse and sexual abuse, and that no one can or will intervene.  Even a judge is shown as powerless to intervene and help the kids.  If a child is being abused, especially sexually abused, it is very difficult for the child to confide that to an adult and get help.  Why in the world, then, would a children's book author give kids the message that if they do confide in an adult, they will not be helped -- and will, in fact, be told that the abusing adult has the right to do so?  For the first time in my life, I am thinking about physically destroying a book, so that my copy at least will not be read by any children.
B0000640SA|5.0|In what must be one of the best movies in years, Christopher Nolan has directed a story that is both intelligent and surprising to the viewer.  Nothing in the story is neatly lain out for the film goer.  There are twists, turns and dead ends in the plot that lead you to suspect one chain of events, while another is the actual truth.  The director insists that the viewer pay attention.<br />Guy Pearce is excellent in the lead role as are all the supporting cast, especially Carrie-Ann Moss as the bartender with ulterior motives.  No one is what they seem as Pearce's character reveals his quest in a reverse chronology.<br />The combination of short-term memeroy loss and reverse chronology of the storytelling work wonderfully, surprising you and challenging you pre-conceptions.  The editor, who's name escapes me, is certainly to be commended for their work.<br />One of the best films to come out of Hollywood in years.  Highest of recommendations.
6303407161|3.0|This is a well-crafted film. It did not do well, and Redford whined that the American public wasn't ready to face their loss of innocence. Blaming the public for the failure of a movie is a cop out. Redford is at fault. He himself said, &quot;I wanted the first half of the movie to move quickly, like television itself. Then the second half I wanted to have a slower pace.&quot; A basic rule of movie narrative is the ONLY time you can be leisurely is at the beginning, and toward the end you really have to pick up the pace. I truly believe Redford's choice to slow the movie down in the second half is why it failed. Rob Morrow's awful acting job doesn't help. But aside from those major caveats, this film is intelligent, well-written, the other performances are first-rate, and it's worth a look.
B000063COX|5.0|This is the album that started it all.  Iron Maiden's fantastic debut.  It's not exactly the Maiden we all know and love today, but it's still a solid debut, one of the best ever.  Paul DiAnno has a much different vocal delivery than Bruce, more rough and aggressive, but it still works.  And, he's also an excellent singer, as you will see on such tracks as \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and the surprisingly soft \\"Strange World\\" (one of the few Maiden songs that never gets heavy).<br />The musicianship is excellent here.  The music itself sounds like a cross between 80's punk and Deep Purple.  However, the technicality is taken up a notch.  Even without Adrian Smith, the guitars still blaze like a wildfire.  Steve Harris puts on what may be his best performance to date.  He is truly one of the best bassists in rock.  He even gets a couple of brief solo spots.  Nice drumming from Clive Burr.  He's not as techinically proficient as Nicko, but he may be a bit faster.<br />The music is generally not as epic (most of the songs are under 4 minutes), but they're still great.  Standouts would have to be \\"Prowler\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", the aforementioned ballads, the awesome instrumental \\"Transylvania\\" (check out Iced Earth's album \\"Horror Show\\" for their incredible cover of the song), and of course \\"Iron Maiden\\".  But I don't think there's a bad song here.<br />I don't think this album can stand up to the later work with Bruce, but it's still great stuff, one of the best albums of 1980. I personally think it destroys \\"British Steel\\" and \\"Back in Black\\", even if those two (great) albums were much more commercially successful.  While it would have been alright (or as Paul would say, \\"olroight\\") if they had kept Paul and made a bunch of albums like this, I for one am glad they got Bruce.  But, it's a shame that Paul never really did much after this.  He's very talented.  Anyway, this is a great album, and every Maiden fan needs to hear where it all began.<br />UP THE IRONS!!!
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem has made my jaw drop and drenched me with sweat and chills from listening to his outstanding and compelling cd. There aren't words to describe the sheer power that is deployed from this beautifully made cd. I havent stopped listening to its views and messages that are delivered to the fullest of his extent. As a fan i am, in a way, proud of Eminem for his abilities and amazing effort that can be easily seen within this CD. I hope this puts him at the top because he deserves every bit of recognition for this CD. Everybit of doubt that was ever brought up by critics and consumers, against his abilities, should be contradicted and expelled to the fullest with what is shown within this CD. I recommend this CD to anyone who is open minded and is able to view the harshness of reality and can face the brutal truth.....that we are ALL human.
B00000I8UK|5.0|The irony about Out to Lunch is that despite the controversy it generates, it is still one of the most popular, accessible, and downright TUNEFUL albums to come out of jazz's 60s avant-garde.  (And it has absolutely classic cover art.)  If the avant-garde really isn't your thing, it may horrify you; but if you have any sympathy for this kind of stuff, even if you don't know it yet, you'll probably love it.  I second others' suggestion to listen to Monk (Brilliant Corners) and Mingus (Mingus Ah Um) first.  If you like those two, then Dolphy's ideas here will make a lot more sense.<br />  Onto the music: this isn't really a free jazz record, as in a bunch of instruments all playing at the same time without reference to harmony or rhythm.  Every theme is composed (with strange, but very catchy melodies) and despite the fact that the improvisation goes all over the place, it somehow manages to stay entirely within the context set by the composition.  The solos all seem to make perfect sense and sound completely natural.  Dolphy is terrific both as a composer and an instrumentalist -- bass clarinet on the first two tracks, flute on \\"Gazzelloni\\", and alto saxophone on the last two tracks.  Freddie Hubbard, a guy known primarily for playing hard bop, fits in really well here.  And the rhythm section is stellar and downright telepathic: Bobby Hutcherson's spacy vibes, Richard Davis's solid yet stretchy bass playing, and Tony Williams's hyper-aware drumming.  There's a classic sequence in \\"Hat and Beard\\" when all three engage in an amazing percussion discussion.<br />  This was one of the first jazz albums I bought as a rock fan who enjoyed Frank Zappa and King Crimson.  I was hooked instantly, and to this day it remains one of my very favorite jazz albums.  Even in a catalogue as star-studded as Blue Note, this is a milestone.  If you like Out to Lunch, other records you may appreciate are Andrew Hill's Point of Departure (with Dolphy, Williams, and Davis) and Bobby Hutcherson's Dialogue (with Hutcherson, Davis, and Hubbard).
B00004BZ16|5.0|Even tho London Calling came out first, it was Sandinista that I first heard, at a friend's home.  Having been exposed to The Clash's punk blasts of their earlier days a few times, I was amazed at the difference in the sound.  After I got Sandinista and listened to it more carefully on my own, I was further amazed at how brilliant it was, period.  The material on Disc 1 and the first third of Disc 2 is almost as strong as London Calling.  It is only on the last two-thirds of Disc 2, originally the third vinyl record of a three-album set, that there is a severe letdown, with repetition and weird, cacophonous sound effects.  But forget this part--focus on the rest. <br />Both London Calling and Sandinista employ many different musical styles, but while London Calling has the edge in power, Sandinista is more imaginative.  Furthermore, as good as the music on Sandinista is, it is the compelling atmosphere of the songs that is its crowning achievement, even its genius.  The eccentric \\"Junco Partner\\" is the most amusing reggae I have ever heard, and the calypso \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" is fabulous.  The pretty \\"Rebel Waltz\\" and its harpsichord overlays are an interesting variation on the theme of revolution.  Sandinista has its share of power workouts too, including the vibe-laden \\"Hitsville U.K.,\\" in which Mick Jones's girlfriend Ellen Foley joins him to create a single-voice-effect harmony, as well as \\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe,\\" with its neat video game/space battle background, and \\"The Sound of the Sinners,\\" with its zippy acoustic guitar and great sarcasm.  But there are also songs in the London Calling knock-em-out vein:  \\"The Leader,\\" \\"Police on My Back,\\" \\"Midnight Log,\\" and the album's strongest entries: \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\" and \\"Up in Heaven.\\"   Some of the longer, atmospheric tracks, such as the funky \\"Lighting Strikes\\" and \\"The Equaliser,\\" seem to drag on, but the musical background is always interesting.  Don't forget the lyrics:  the at once melodramatic and mournful \\"One More Time\\" is a highly evocative, reggae-style demand for ghetto justice, and \\"Something About England\\" should be listened to carefully.  Lastly, \\"Washington Bullets,\\" one of the best tracks, is effectively the title cut, and based on what I just stated, it is not hard to figure out what it is about.<br />On London Calling, The Clash's music was eclectic within the bounds of their newly found more palatable but still dynamic sound.  On Sandinista, they went beyond themselves to produce their most innovative, imaginative, and atmospheric work.  Ultimately, there is more diversity of music on Sandinista, not counting the last part (which doesn't count anyway).  Sandinista was, well, revolutionary.
B000059XUO|5.0|When you watch a movie based on a comic book, you shouldn't expect the story or script to be profound, they're usually simple tales of good versus evil. So, based on that I could ignore some of the problems others might have had with the dialouge or the story. What I found to be brilliant were the visuals, and the use of music. This movie, in addition to Alex Proyas' other movie 'Dark City' seem to use exaggerated backgrounds and Landscapes. Other movies that come to mind are 'Batman' & if you want to go back to German expressionism 'The Cabinet of DR. Caligari' In which the city looks fake on purpose to give you that sense that it's out of a dream or a nightmare. Don't get me wrong, like I said, for a comic book the story is fine. And Brandon Lee does a fine job in this movie(When he gets mad, to me he REALLY looks mad) Basically, I used to love comic books, and when a movie gets made based on one, I like the director to keep the style of the one it's based on, and I think this movie did that perfectly.
B00004U8P9|3.0|Fun in it's day but I can only stick about an hour of this now before my brain atrophies. The last quarter seems to hint at something deeper and is melancholic, even depressive.<BR>Richard O'Brien, a talented and charismatic man, does some classy busking in the special features and then sits down to do some risible character analysis on his creations, a sign that the whole cult thing has got out of hand. Barry Bostwick claims that he was already jaded before joining the cast. Well, thank you kindly, Bazza, for taking the time and trouble to fly over from the big apple to show us backward Brits how to walk on the wild side. We is so grateful, Massa. Hope our little country ways didn't bore you too much. He then goes on to more or less tell 'Rocky' fans to get a life. His pomposity is worthy of Brad himself. Patricia Quinn is not what you expect, either. One of those loud, pretentious lovey types that appear to be teetering on the brink of desperation. Maybe she's always like that. Curry appears only on stage at the anniversary bash and looks distinctly uncomfortable at his rock star celebrity. Meat Loaf is unexpectedly funny but his motorbike stunt double story is not as scintilating as he clearly believes it is. Susan Sarandon looks amazing crawling through the smoke at the end of the film. Her interview also runs on too long but she comes across as a game lady.<br />WARNING: The extra features were glitchy, especially on alleged state of the art PC. Richard O'Brien's commentary wouldn't play at all.
B00005B36H|5.0|For the longest time, I wasn't too crazy about Tool.  They used to drive me crazy with their 7 minute long songs and odd videos, but no more.  Slowly, Schism grew on me so I had to get Lateralus. So this is my first Tool cd and I plan to get more.  When you listen to this cd its just AMAZING.   The track Lateralus itself is 9 minutes long!  But to me, Tool is very unique, they can take the simplest gutair sound and make it sound good. And Danny Carrey is great at the drums. Its a slow cd, but you get addicted to it right when you first start the CD. I reccomend this cd, even if you dont like tool, cuz you will like them after this.
6305882592|4.0|I'm puzzled as to why some people have adopted this movie as a life manifesto as it is rather a nasty piece of work. Counter culture perniciousness is never far from the surface and the death stuff is pure 'Addams Family' corn, although undeniably amusing on that level.<BR>Someone here mentioned the curious adoption of an 'Ubermensch' philosophy by Maude reminiscent of her war time captors and I don't know whether or not it was intended ironically. Before the fall she was obviously part of the same bourgeoise. Mind you, Hitler was a bit of a pleb and skint, too. Anyway, does 'aiming above morality' mean lack of responsibility to those closest to you? Despite surely being aware of Harold's emotional vulnerability, Maude does not make her 'saturday' intentions clear to him, other than as a vague reference in passing. The expression on Ruth Gordon's face as an actress while dropping this bombshell to Harold suggests she did not truly believe in this scene or the film as a whole, which uses the smokescreen of eccentricity to excuse Maude's lack of clarity. But since she is clearly articulate on most matters, there is an ambivalence at the heart of this picture. She appears to cruelly lead him on, only to crush him with a bromide. What are we to make of all of this? Even an offbeat film needs to maintain a certain internal logic. Likewise, stealing cars that may have been needed in a life and death emergency leaves a nasty taste. If there is an epiphany here, then I cannot see it.<BR>This lack of internal logic extends to the direction, too. Ashby has great quirky timing but there is also a curious dishonesty at work. On the first date, how could Harold have got out from under those sheets and replaced them with a dummy without the girl in the house noticing? It would have taken exceptional sleight of hand and the director doesn't convince us. Likewise the business with Harold's hand on the second date. He clearly uses his real hands for the mouth freshner but are we then expected to believe he could have somehow slipped a false hand on to his sleave (miraculously lengthened) in front of his guest? This sloppy attitude can be seen in the opening scene. The shot behind Harold's head shows the rope not touching his body. From the other side we clearly see the rope going into his shoulder to support his weight. Also, in a later scene, the motorcycle cop aiming to shoot the fleeing protaganists with a civilian clearly walking into view. Should any of this matter in what is basically a comedy of (bad) manners? I think the film wants it both ways, that is seriousness and silliness, but it doesn't think it has to try too hard. However, if you sacrifice credibility in a style of dead pan realism you will not get away with it. Perhaps someone should have reminded Mr Ashby that comedy is, in fact, a serious business.<BR>The main compensations in 'Harold and Maude' are the little details. The motorcycle cop's trouser problem. The way various vehicles splutter into life and barely get going suggesting the vulnerability of us all in a changing world. Harold's legs in the opening scene and his petulant reaction to furniture obstructing his way. The peculiar pause when Maude asks Harold whether it's wrong to pose nude.<BR>As a whole though, it is distinctly uneven. The 'took my head' scene does not work but the actress scene is absolutely inspired.<BR>This is the archetypal cult movie and beggers the question as to whether films can ever be 'cult' like this again, what with the closure of 'rep' cinemas which traditionally supported these pictures and the ready avaliability of home video. Will the definition of 'cult' simply mean failure at the box office?<BR>The picture quality is reasonable. The chief advantage is the sound which is hugely superior to my video copy.

A combination of great  music, special effects, loyal friendship, everlasting love and sad tragedy, Pearl Harbor is the best movie in 2001! <br />When I first saw the movie, I immediately loved it! I saw it four times in the cinema and dreamed of owning it on a video - that dream became a reality. :o) <br />That's all I have to say - this movie really is nice, do not listen to critics' reviews - they always find a nice movie to pick on! Go see it - even though I know 90 percent of you have seen it! I dont know what you think, but I think this movie is so beautiful yet so tragic! Buy it - period.

B000002KE2|4.0|Vol 4. represents Black Sabbath in their prime.  The success of the album &quot;Paranoid&quot; catapulted Ozzy, Iommi, Butler and Ward into the big time and their immediate follow-ups to that album do not disappoint.  &quot;Vol. 4&quot; is a stunning classic that contains many of Sabbath's best songs, and except for the dreadful &quot;Changes&quot; this album delivers the goods.  Standout tracks are &quot;Supernaut,&quot; the brilliantly powerful &quot;Snowblind,&quot; &quot;Wheels Of Confusion,&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow's Dream.&quot;  This album often gets overshadowed by Sabbath's debut, &quot;Paranoid,&quot; and &quot;Masters Of Reality,&quot; but this is a must have for any serious fan of Sabbath's music.
B0000033WC|5.0|This is my favorite velvet underground album.  It should have been a huge album at the time, with two epic rock n' roll songs: &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;.  Lou Reed took his insightful ability to perceive the darker, ominous, and decadant side of human nature and combined it with a propulsive and good-natured pop sound.  I think Lou's artistry is at its highest on this album because he transforms songs about over-the-hill actresses, lonesome cowboys, and disillusioned youth into bright and wistful tales of humanity with the power of rock and roll.  Oh yeah, this also has the best blues-rock song ever penned:  &quot;Oh Sweet Nuthin&quot;.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem has done it again. Not only has he got that funny first single like the past two records but he also has the songs that tell the stories.

0385503954|4.0|&quot;Atonement&quot; is a beautifully written work, possibley the best of McEwen's novels.  He's a favorite of mine.  However, the defining event in the story, involving a mis-identification of a perpetrator of a criminal act, flawed the otherwise brilliant novel.  I found it not only improbable, but impossible, to accept that a police department, even one as probably naive in its techniques as the one in the book, would take the identification of an alleged perpetrator by a pre-pubescent child, who didn't see the perpetrator's face, in the middle of the night, under difficult circumstances, as enough proof, without a corroborating witness, to charge someone with a most serious crime.  It's even more improbable that a good criminal defense lawyer wouldn't have torn the witness's testimony to shreds.  Nevertheless, the book goes on from this event to its conclusion.  Fatally flawed.
B000002C25|5.0|I don't know why this album is regarded as one of Oasis's lesser albums. In my opinion it is their best album, and tends to be the album in which I still listen to the most. It is probably Oasis's hardest most heavy album with songs like &quot;My Big Mouth&quot;, &quot;I hope, I think, I Know&quot;, &quot;it's gettin better man&quot;, and &quot;D'you Know what I mean&quot;. Th album has more of a rock feel than a pop feel than &quot;What's the Story Mourning Glory&quot;. I feel that every song on this CD are great rock songs. Give it a listen because it is the best album Oasis has put out.
0792844890|5.0|The Planet Spaceball has a problem; They're slowly running out of air.  However, they have a plan; Capture Vespa(Daphne Zuniga), the Princess of their peace-loving neighbor planet Druidia, which would force their father, King Roland(Dick Van Patten), to give them the combination to the air shield, which underneath contains 10,000 years of fresh air.  Instead, the Princess and her droid Dot Matrix(Voice of Joan Rivers), running away from her wedding to Prince Valium(JM J.Bullock), they find her.  After being offered $1 million spacebucks, which they need to pay off gangster Pizza the Hutt(Dom DeLuise), space pirate Lonestarr(Bill Pullman)and his half dog/half man sidekick Barf(John Candy)go to stop the evil Lord Dark Helmet(Rick Moranis)and Spaceball President Skroob(Mel Brooks)and along the way, Lonestarr learns the ways of the Schwartz from the everlasting know-it-all Yogurt(Mel Brooks)<br />  This movie, along with \\"DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT\\" is Mel Brooks at his best.  It's fricking hilarious!!  Bill Pullman is great as Lonestarr, a spoof combination of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, Daphne Zuniga gives her all as Princess Vespa, John Candy is hilarious as Barf, Joan Rivers is decent as Dot Matrix, Rick Moranis is downright classic as Dark Helmet, a wimpy puny spoof of Darth Vader(He's the funniest guy on this movie!!!)and the rest of the cast is average.  <br />  Highly recommended as one of Mel Brook's best and with lines like \\"I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate\\", \\"You are to refer to me as idiot, not you captain!\\", you won't stop laughing.  So see this film.<br />  AND MAY THE SCHWARTZ BE WITH YOU!!
6305265666|5.0|You can never go wrong with a Drew Barrymore movie. While I was skeptical at first when this movie came out, I was pleasently surprised in the end. The new updated and mature telling of the Cinderella story is a must have for the die hard romantics. The performances by Anjelica Houston and Megan Dodds are to be noted. I loved the twist on the other step sister played by Melanie Lynskey (she also starred in \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" with Kate Winslet). This is a must have DVD for any Drew Barrymore fan.

John Mayer is an Up-in-coming artist that desereves LARGE amounts of credit for his work...his lyrics are both sweet &amp; very true at the same time.. John's writing incorporates high school questioning with adult logic... what a great solution to your music dilema...John is an amazing new artist that demands your attention...whether your listening to St. Patrick's Day or No Such Thing, there's something on this C.D. for everyone...So HURRY up and go...your not getting any younger!
B00005JL0U|1.0|This is the most horrific thing I've ever laid eyes upon. Sure the music videos are great, but it doesn't make up for the horrible deeply disturbing Michael Jackson montage. The beginning of the movie starts off with the wonders and greatness of MJ... then it moves onto how he hates the attention and he hates being famous... then it turns into complete insanity. I could feel my soul trying to jump out of my pores when I saw the \\"plot\\" shown. It involves MJ turning into random vehicles/animals/objects specifically to save children and scare the heck out of me. Another thing greatly disturbing is the focus on children, which most definitely does not support MJ on the entire pedophilia issue. But maybe I'm just weird... The music's great! The rest is disturbing...
6305165912|5.0|the movie is one of my favorites.  It gets better with each watching.  Every line is subtly humerous.  although the plot is obviously not the best ever, it is not the point of the movie.  LISTEN PEOPLE. listen to what they say and youl love it.
B00006690F|5.0|After hearing the first single \\"Without Me\\", and seeing the video, I wasn't really sure what to expect for this effort.  After I popped the cd in and heard the first track, I knew that I was in for a hot record.  This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard.  It is the best rap record released since the great 2Pac's All Eyez On Me or Biggies Life After Death.  Eminem diplays his musical maturity and confirms the depth of his talent.  Songs like \\"Soldier\\" and \\"'Til I Collapse\\" are my early favorites, while \\"White America\\" mocks his critics and \\"When the Music Stops\\" displays the ray lyrical content you expect from the Dirty Dozen.  Em teams with Steven Tyler and samples Aerosmiths \\"Dream On\\" for \\"Sing for the Moment\\" and shows his softer side on \\"Hailie's song\\".  Slimshady simply brings the noise with the Eminem Show.

038533558X|5.0|Not many novels can start strong, and keep the pace as well as this new addition from Harlan Coben.  His stories spring to life so clearly, you almost believe these people exist in another place or time.<br />Without giving any hints to the storyline, I'll tell you it's easy to read from front to back in two days.  This coming from a mom of two toddlers who carried the book around and sneaked pages in between cleaning up sticky fingers and dirty diapers!
B00006690F|3.0|As a big fan of Eminem for the past few years, this lastest rendition of Slim Shady is very disappointing.  None of tracks on the album are catchy-leaving you the feeling that the entire album was put together in a hurry or rush.  Eminem needs to take this album back and redo his work.  I believe that his second album is still light years ahead of this lastest effort.
0805047905|5.0|Every parent probably knows this story.  However I learned it was put to music, namely the music of \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.\\"  So now it's a portable story to sing in the car or on walks.  My children love to sing it, and it reinforces memorization, color identification and animals.<br />Try it as a song today, you'll be hooked!
B00000F169|5.0|If life is absurd, then life in a spaceship is surreal. A truly weird, inventive movie that is so funny you won't care about the rather poor video quality due to the old prints. Useful next time you need to discuss philosophy with a snooty bomb.
0399230033|5.0|Wordless picture books give children the opportunity to create their own story by what they see.  My one-year old picked up on items in the story that I never saw.  For example, he pointed out that on every page appears the balloon, the mouse and the banana.  Perception is wonderful, and I only perceived the primary animals.  His perception followed the mouse's escapades as well as the balloon's departure into the night sky.<br />That's the beauty of wordless picture books - perception.
630469878X|4.0|When I mentioned to someone that I watched this film.  They said \\"Dude, it's a girl-film.\\"  I told him \\"It was funny though, and I liked it.\\"  I can see why people might think of this film that way though.  But that would be missing the point of the film I think.<br />Thelma and Louise are supposed to be going off on a vacation, but a pit stop at a bar leads to a murder.  They decide to run as far and as fast away as possible.  Along the way, they make several mistakes that made it tougher and tougher for them to escape from the law.  But they sure as hell tried till the very end anyways.<br />I liked it because I'm tired of seeing bad guys being just that -- bad \\"guys\\".  With Thelma and Louise, you're not sure whether to like them or pity them.  They're not evil \\"bad\\".  They're what I would even consider \\"naughty\\".<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 3.5 (Thelma says some pretty hilarious things.)<BR>E (Erotica) - 2.5 (All this E comes from Geena Davis.  There's a rape scene, and a 5 second love scene with Brad Pit.)<BR>A (Action) - 3 (Pretty good car chase scene.)<BR>P (Plot) - 3 (Predictable till the surprise ending which is famous by now.)

B00005V1Y0|5.0|The story is very simple.  It's about a champion ballroom dancer who has always wanted to dance his own unconventional steps.  Doing so, however, he might please the crowd, but not the judges.  Three weeks before the Pan Pacific competition, Scott Hastings (the protagonist) has a falling out with his partner for this reason.  Little does he know that by teaching a beginner to dance the way he wants to dance, his world would be turned upside down.  At the core, this is a lovestory between Scott and his \\"ugly-duckling\\" student Fran (short for Francesca).<br />The choreography is nothing short of stunning.  The dancing is an integral part of the movie.  It tells part of the story.  The protagonist ends up learning a new style of dancing called Para Dos (Spanish for \\"for two\\") as he reaches a point in the story where he realizes that his life is not to be lived alone anymore; when he finds love.<br />This film catapulted Baz Luhrmann's career.  He eventually followed up with films like Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge, incorporating a similar style of audacious characters with love songs from the 80s.  Another reason why I like his films is for the humor.  You leave feeling cheerful.  I guess I'm still a kid at heart, and I like my stories to end \\"... and they lived happily ever after.\\"<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 4 (the dancing and music helped in telling the story as well)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - unfortunately)<BR>A (Action) - 0 (n/a - the dancing was amazing)<BR>P (Plot) - 3 (simple love story)
B00000J631|5.0|This is an amazing album, true punk to chill to. My only problem is that my CD player is VERY old and can not support that number of tracks so i have to use my comp to play them. But this is they best way to get into new bands and discover new styles through demo disks so KEEP IT UP.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I think \\"5 stars\\" are given out way too much on amazon.com, in fact, I hardly ever give them out myself.  But Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot well deserves these stars.  This album perfectly balances rocking-out and slowing it down for simply beautiful music.  Sprinkled in are haunting echoes and looping voices that just add to the coolness.<br />This is actually the first Wilco album I have heard, and I could tell after one listen that this album was a masterpiece.  It may come slower to others, but believe me, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot will go down as one of the best of 2002.

038533558X|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. Character development is too the point and not overdone. The storyline is intriguing and it has normal people responding in normal ways, no superheroes here, nor are their supervillians. And oh did I mention it has the best ending I have ever read. If you like twists, we are talking corkscrew like twists, then this is your book. The Sixth Sense has nothing on this book. Anyone who reads his Myron books, trust me when I tell you, get this book. And anyone who doesn't read his Myron books, trust me when I tell you, get this book. You'll feel the same after having read it. Now if my family would just return my copy, it seems to be making it's rounds. Expect the same from your family, you'll be touting this book to them  like it contains the secret to eternal life.......<br />Review help - I enjoy Robert Crais, Stephen White, John Grisham, Micheal Connelly, and Ridley Pearson. If you enjoy these writers then you will definitely enjoy Coben. If you liked City Of Bones, L.A. Requiem, get Gone For Good. It's better.
B000059H98|5.0|Completely unrelated to the actual movie which is GREAT!, this DVD is the only one I have ever had that has problems playing. Not in my portable DVD player, not in the Sony reference player, but always hangs the player when play is attempted in the Sony 300+1 model 860 CD changer. And it hangs sometimes in the Daewoo player, but not more than 1 in ten starts.<br />Other than that this is action packed and great fun. Lori Petty brings a spark to her role that is marvelous. Set in a post apocalyptic frame of reference where water is the commodity that controls power in the society, Lori Petty's character rocks as a rebel against corrupt societal control. <br />Awesome for teens plus, probably not great for the kiddlets.
B000063UR2|5.0|As stated in other reviews, this movie has been highly under-rated. Just seeing the American release, though, it's easy to see why. While the Tangerine Dreams score was all well and good, it didn't take the movie seriously. The score made an otherwise dark and gritty fantasy movie into a light hearted fairy tale. The dialogue was choppy and often cliche. Characters were one sided and often boring.<br />Now here comes the Directors cut. The score makes this dark and gritty movie truely epic. The dialogue has been restored so you know what the characters are talking about, and characterization has been fleshed out. This is how the movie should have been released in the first place. <br />Having both versions of the movie in one set for such a low price is really a treat (there are still some things in the American version that make it worth the watch). Being the type to always look to see what extras are included, I must say I'm really satisfied with what's included here (see edition details above).<br />With the recent release of the Lord of the Rings movies, I believe that America is finally catching on to the dark side of fantasy. Not every fantasy movie is a nice fairy tale with a pink little bow on top. This movie exemplifies the dark, epic fantasy adventure. Definitely worth the price!
B00006690F|5.0|Can this man lose? He is a musical and lyrical genuis. Say what you want about him, but he is beyond talented. There are only 2 songs on this album that I do not think are \\"great\\", and those are \\"Drips\\" and \\"Superman\\". The songs \\"Sing for the Moment\\", \\"Hailie's Song\\", \\"Cleaning out my Closet\\" and \\"White America\\" are stand outs. \\"Sing for the Moment\\" is the best track on the album if you ask me, it has lyrical depth not heard from Em before and the sample of Aerosmith's \\"Dream on\\" is brilliant. The best line from the song reads as follows \\"We're nothin' to you but we're the f..kin sh.. in they eyes<BR>That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it, cuz we consider these minutes golden <BR>And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone. Just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs\\" Em gets deep. There is also the beautiful ode to his daughter on \\"Hailie's Song\\", Eminem sings, yes he sings, about how his daughter is the reason he is alive, \\"Sometimes I think I'm crazy, oh so crazy. Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time. But then I see my baby and suddenly I'm not crazy. It all makes sense when I look into her eyes\\". It is sweet and shows his sweeter side. He also talks about his insecurities and about how people think nothing phases him, but inside it is eating him alive. \\"White America\\", the song about free speech and his right to it. It is one of those songs you just listen to and feel what he is saying, like \\"Sing for the Moment\\" also. He goes as far as to shout out Mrs. Cheney and Tipper Gore, but they are deserving and this is not a nice shout out. \\"Cleaning out My Closet\\", is just that cleaning out his personal closet of skeltons. He hits his Mom hard here, but who gives a damn, for what she did to her son in the media, she is also deserving. Em shows great lyrical depth here and sounds very angry. Something that stands out in my mind from the song is the lyric, \\"Remeber when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well, guess what I am dead. Dead to you as can be!\\" It is definitely a stand out track, easily. On this album, some strongs are just as angry as though on \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\", but then there are songs like \\"Hailie's Song\\" which are light and beautiful and show the softer side and truly displays his love for his little girl. His daughter is even featured on the album on the song \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\", she is such a cutie. <br />Even if you did like Eminem, pick this album up. It will change your mind. This is the best rap album of the year, and the best since Jay-Z's \\"The Blueprint\\", easily. You must cop it. The lyrics are deeper, the beats are stronger, Eminem is better.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem did it again, he kicks [butt].
B00006690F|5.0|This album is by far one of Marshall's best works. Yes he does sing on the album on a few tracks. He has great rhythem during Say Goodbye to Hollywood. My dads Gone Crazy is very funny and very heart felt, With Hailey in the song. Sing for the moment is good although eminem doesnt sing the chorus. I think he should have sang instead of Steve Tyler even though i am a Aerosmith fan. This cd is great but i think slim shady lp was his best, it was him before he was rich and he was really pissed off at life, it was awesome.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem not only is a gifted musical artist but is also a gifted writer. He goes a great job with this cd. My most favorite song on here is also on his trailer for his upcoming movie called, \\"8 Mile,\\" which is called \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet.\\" This cd is a big change from the Marshall Mathers LP cd. It seems like he has more pride in the work he does, and what's cute about this cd is that he has his lil girl in one of the skits and he also has a song called, \\"Hailie's Song,\\" which is also another one of my favorites. <br />The DVD is aight, It has some music video's and it also includes one of Slim Shady's cartoons, and it includes the trailer for his upcoming movie which i had talked about earlier.  Overrall this cd is worth it. \\"The Eminem Show,\\" is Eminem's best so far, and i can't wait till he comes up with more.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Hmmm...American Beauty. The movie is showing the beauty in a piece of garbage to contrast the ugliness of the aesthetically pleasing lifestyle of suburbia! Like the cliche, 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'! All of our wonderful material possesions, our wants, our desires, all that we strive for are merely illusions substituting as quality. They're just things! The point is emphatically made when Lester Burham tells Carolyn &quot;IT'S JUST A COUCH&quot; when he nearly spills some beer on the fine Italian silk upholstery!  The movie encourages the viewer to look closer. To critically examine lifestyle rationalizations, even the mundane!  Lester reaches a point of breaking the illusion and sees the world for what it is: a series of decisions all bent on making our lives livable. We Americans(in lieu of looking closer) need 'things', instead of attempting the achievable of mindful awareness that these apparently necessary 'things' will only cause additional anxiety!(case in point:Carolyn's anxiety of possibly spilling beer on the fine Italian silk uphosltery!)  We all live there in that place, that illusion of self assured statisfaction...a place that doesn't exist!  Ricky Fitts, is perhaps the only sane, stable character in the movie. He saw what denial and our twisted American value system had done to his father. This is far, far too common in America!   A challenging and transcendent motion picture!
B00005UW7V|5.0|This is one of the most original movies ever and the plot is really unique. This film is so touching as you can feel the strong bond between the mother and the child. The hero of the story may be a robot but he loved his human mother so deeply. This is a kind of a post-modern version of Pinocchio with much to offer to the watcher as the artificially intelligent and totally human-looking robot is putting him self into a great deal of trouble seeking for the blue fairy who will turn him into a real human child so that his mother will love him.  I definitely believe this is one MUST SEE movie for everybody. Of course you have to tolerate Spielberg's imagination (something that I believe we are all used to do) since he turns the movie into a totally different way than we expected, he managed to merge so many movie genres into one. He also gives us the happiest and touching ending possible. There will be moments that you will deeply feel the scene inside you. Finally, I believe this I a masterpiece and I unreservedly suggest it to everybody and especially mothers.
B00005YXZH|2.0|I really enjoyed Wilco's recordings with Billy Bragg and \\"AM\\" but this one is way undercooked for songs with meaning and musicians that can play, and overcooked with effects and garbled \\"I always wanted to be a Beatle\\" type retro wanking. Did I buy this to hear a drummer try his best to sound like Ringo Starr (listen to track one to see what I mean)? Tweedy's vocals are dull and the words he sings are just as uninspiring. Skip this one unless you like throwing away money. I made better music in elementary band class then is on this CD.
B00006690F|4.0|Eminems lyrics have actually improved since his critically acclaimed official debut The Slim Shady LP.  Eminem has gained the respect of the public as well as underground heads and everyone in between.  His lyrics are some of the best that hip hop has to offer.  He no longer rhymes for the sake of rhyming words.  On this album he does so with skill, meaning and power and the results are much more satisfying.  And this is coming from a person who is not a DR for you know what either.  I was sorta impressed with this album.<br />Although some think that SSLP and MMLP were classics, they were not.  They had limited replay value and relied on weak gimmicks and shock value.  But even through all that they were still solid discs.  However the Eminem Show is different.  Eminem matures as an artist by flexing his production skills on 80% of the songs on here.  This in turn improves his flow because he knows his vibe and how to flow over his own beats.  As mentioned earlier his writing is improved and he even puts the lyrics in the book, which is always extra special.  He addresses most of his past accusations and basically gets things off his chest.<br />Dont be fooled by the horrendous first single Without Me, because it is basically horrible.  The beat [is terrible] and his flow is off and plus he sounds like a lil ho on the song.  But much to my surprise Eminem has some versatile production skills.  None of the songs sound the same, a common problem for amateur producers, isnt a problem here.    My favorite songs are Drips- a song about getting a disease from a woman that was with his homie as well, Soldier, White America, Superman, Cleaning Out My Closet, Say What U Say feat. Dr. Dre which is a decent diss to Jermaine Dupri.  But what gets me is they diss Jermaine Dupri but havent responded to Suge Knight and companys F. Dre.  I think it was a good move though since they both value their lives.<br />The Eminem Show is Eminems most complete recordto date but not really a classic album.  He does a good job on most of the songs but it is songs like Without Me, Hailies Songa horrible singing experimentation, Til I Collapse feat. Nate Dogg which is horrendous, and My Dads Gone Crazy---more [garbage] that bring this album down.  However it is still worth the purchase, because on the songs he does connect it is truly something remarkable.  <br />*The DVD includes some concert excerpts, Just Dont Give A F. video,  8 mile movie trailer and some other extras*
B00004XQ83|5.0|First of all, I am more of a movie buff than a bluegrass fan. This was the music my parents listened to, familar to me, but not a favorite genre. Also, I not someone who likes soundtracks -- I own only two others, LPs of The Sound of Music (received as a gift when I was 5) and The Rocky Horror Picture Show (a college purchase). Movie music, outside of musicals, was at best an emotional string puller. Think about the themes for Schindlers List, Driving Miss Daisy, or Chariots of Fire, popping up at the critical, emotional moments. Nice, but a secondary experience.<br />That said, in the movie OBWT, the music is as integral part of the storytelling as the acting, dialog and cinematography. It is a profound statement, a humorous break, a well developed character unto itself. I had never been so moved by movie music and bought the cd that evening. It was impulsive purchase, a souvenir of a great movie moment. I wasn't expecting to have my socks knocked off. <br />A few tracks, O Death & Indian War Whoop, are tough listening to my untrained ear, but remember, I'm only a layman listener. Without the film, it was like trying to enjoy a movie by looking at a bunch of stills. The rest, especially when the ladies sing, are beyond compare. The lyrics are about real emotional experience. The voices range from beautiful to angelic. It was like a fantastic visit to the collective unconscious. Somewhere you've heard these songs, but never so well done. <br />Is it the world's best introduction to bluegrass? Maybe, maybe not, but it's not designed to be. It's the soundtrack from a movie!! Bothered by 4 versions of Man of Constant Sorrow? Pick your favorite, and skip over the rest. It's the soundtrack of a movie and that's the main theme!!! What you will find is incredible, tenable, likeable music you'll listen to over and over again. Music you might never have known how to find. Music you'll want to further explore.
B00006690F|5.0|\\"The Eminem Show\\" displays a maturing Marshall Bruce Mathers III in an album that's not as funny as \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" or as shocking as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". The title is a takeoff of the Jim Carrey movie \\"The Truman Show\\". Thus we get a brutally real view of his adult life, kind of where \\"Slim Shady\\" left off. By now there's no question of his rap skills; he's easily the most talented and original MC working right now. Although most of this album is serious, there's still some funny moments, offensive lyrics, and the usual lot of disses (Lynn Chaney, Tipper Gore, the Bush administration, Chris Kirkpatrick, Moby, Jermaine Dupri, his mom and dad) and loves (Dr. Dre, his fans, the rap business, and especially his daughter Hailie). But the bulk of this album is Em's life and the world around him. That, along with the incredible beats and rhyming skills make this his best album so far, in my opinion. Standout tracks include:WHITE AMERICA-Em's view on how the fact that he's white helped make him the star he is today and how some members of the government were attempting to violate his right to free speech.  He also takes time out to thank Dr. Dre for launching his career.  BUSINESS-A clever Batman-themed rant from Em and Dre about how important they are to the rap industry. CLEANING OUT MY CLOSET-Easily my favorite on this album. This displays the multi-dimensional Em I've been looking for. It's a showdown with his mother Debbie. He does admit to some wrongdoing, then he lashes out at her faults. He even mentions that \\"Set The Record Straight\\" CD she put out in 2000. This certainly isn't the typical mother/son relationship that most of us have been blessed with. The last line of this song will show once and for all why Em disrespects her. This track is featured in his upcoming movie \\"8 Mile\\". SAYIN' GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD-More confessional from Em, this time on his divorce from Kim and how his rage over her extramarrital affair neary pushed him over the edge, but didn't because of his devotion to his daughter.  As much as I despised that \\"Kim\\" track on \\"Marshall Mathers\\", it's certainly better to rap about murdering your wife than to do it. WITHOUT ME-This fun, funny, radio-friendly first single is Em mocking his own controversial image and how the fans eat it up. (\\"I've created a monster, 'cuz nobody wants to see Marshall no more. They want Shady. I'm chopped liver.\\") HALIE'S SONG-A loving ode to his daughter. He sings (sort of)! WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS-A funny commentary by Em and the rest of his dirty half-dozen on how music and reality can be blurred. The funniest and most tragic editorial comes from Bizarre. MY DAD'S GONE CRAZY-Now we hear Hailie's cute voice, introducing her dad as he slams the goverment and his Mom some more. Of course, some of Em's views will make you cringe, especially his view on govenment which won't sit well with our war on terrorism (It's a good thing this album got released 8 1/2 months after 9/11). And a couple of tracks didn't quite work. DRIPS could've been a clever cautionary tale against unprotected sex but the lyrics were too graphic. And SING FOR THE MOMENT, a commentary on why rappers express themselves so explicitly, shamelessly rips off Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\". (C'mon, Em, you're too talented to resort to sampling) But Em's raw honesty makes for a very compelling CD.  The DVD is basically a promotional sampler with excerpts from his \\"E\\" and \\"The Slim Shady Show\\" and his upcoming \\"All Access Europe\\" DVD's, and a trailer for his upcoming movie \\"8 Mile\\".  It does have some rare concert footage and interviews.  (He's begging us to buy his D-12 album, since it didn't sell nearly as well as first 2 albums did, or as well as this one will).
B00005UKE0|5.0|This has to be one of the best solo albums ever issued. Mainly because Harrison had been kept under wraps for nearly a decade within The Beatles, this album must have been a revelation when it was issued in 1970. It has been overrated,underappreciated all at the same time, but what is clear is this . . . .  Harrison was as good a songwriter as those he is compared with, maybe his only equals if there are to be comparisons made, and the overall quality of his solo compositions, and his absolute dogmatic determination to write what he wanted to once given the freedom to do so, will give anyone unfamiliar with his work something to look forward to.<br />If compared with the two men he's always compared to, Harrison's main strengths are:<br />An incredibly open honesty in his lyric, easily slipping into the profound.<br />Craftsmanship. His acoustic guitar, slide guitar work is near impeccable. His love of guitar shaped every song.<br />\\"All Things Must Pass\\" pleases on many levels. The commercial side (\\"What Is Life\\"/\\"My Sweet Lord\\"), the profound (\\"Beware of Darkness\\"/\\"The Art of Dying\\") and the simply beautiful (\\"Run of the Mill\\"/\\"All Things Must Pass\\"/\\"Isn't It A Pity{Version One}).<br />It is not surprising he was accused of plagiarism for \\"My Sweet Lord\\". Any lover of music will know that Western music is incredibly repetitive of itself, \\"borrowing\\" cannot be helped, it was admitted by Harrison himself that the song was more inspired by the traditional \\"Oh Happy Day\\", which \\"He's So Fine\\" bears more than a passing resemblance to itself! What's more important here, and what probably got him in more trouble was saying \\"Hallelujah\\" and \\"Hare Krishna\\" in the same light, for the man knew there was no difference between the two apart from different letters, and he got everyone to sing it.<br />This album is full of beauty. It explores pain, death, love, hope, belief, friendships, home, and a nice ditty about God,<br />and what that possibly could be. One of the finest albums ever released, especially from an ex-Beatle. The only other solo album by an ex-Beatle that can come close to matching the power of this album is John Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" released the same year. But for sheer elegance and compassion, I look to \\"All Things Must Pass\\" as the best achievement made by an individual who used to be with three other guys that they'll always be remembered for being with.s ever released, especially from an ex-Beatle.

B000005ILF|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I certainly believe this CD takes many listens to truly appreciate its beauty, but once there, what a find!  There's nothing close to a bad song on this album, and some amazing combination of genres (&quot;La Belle,&quot; &quot;I'm So Happy&quot; etc.).  It certainly is an amazing CD for listening on a cold winter day.  &quot;I Was Brought To My Senses&quot; is one of the best songs ever written about spring, so I guess this CD can be enjoyed year round (I certainly agree).  &quot;Valparaiso&quot; was used so effectively at the end of &quot;White Squall,&quot; if you haven't caught that flick.  And I just heard Johnny Cash is covering &quot;I Hung My Head&quot; on his next album.  That will be an amazing version to hear.  So if you haven't figured out from all my rambling, buy this CD to hear a truly underrated piece of work, right up there with &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun.&quot;
630339406X|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest films all of all times,EVER!!<BR> Tom Hanks did an exellent job playing a young boy(Joshua \\"Josh\\" Baskins) trapped in a grown mans' body.

Those are classic \\"BIG\\" moments, along with him playing the gaint Step-On Keyboard at FAO Schwarz Toy Store that will never leave my memory!It was very interesting seeing Tom Hanks show his boyish side; that innocent charm that very few actors could have probably pulled off so well. I also like the moral to the story as well, JUST LIKE THEY SAY: \\"Be careful what you wish for,'cause you may get it\\". Every wish comes with a price. There's no such thing as a perfect wish.<BR> (You'll know what I mean if you haven't seen the film yet). If you haven't seen this extraordinary movie yet, then please do yourself a favor and buy it. Or at least rent it first,then I'll guarantee you will purchase this movie to share with your family and friends for years to come.<BR> P.S. I think Tom Hanks was perfect for the part of Josh,but do you think anybody else could havedone a good job as well? What about Bill Murray or Robin Williams? What do you think? Well...now that i think about it, with Tom Hanks playing the Award winning role,and seeing how well it was played, I don't think I'd have it any other way. -- PEACE.
B000065V9N|5.0|Much like the Police's &quot;Synchronicity,&quot; which was a commercial smash while being musically adventurous, Peter Gabriel's &quot;So&quot; showed how music could be experimental while being catchy.  Certainly the funkiness of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot;Big Time&quot; got many toes tapping.  It's the other songs that make this a timeless wonder, however.  &quot;Red Rain,&quot; &quot;Don't Give Up,&quot; and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; are complex, while instilling themselves in your brain for eternity.  For me, the most hypnotic song on the album (and probably the most hypnotic song EVER) is &quot;Mercy Street!&quot;  I have never heard keyboards sound as human as they do on this song.  And the lyric &quot;Words support like bone&quot; is a simile that I've been toying with for 16 years.  I am anxious to hear this album on remastered CD, as I have only had the cassette since 1986 (it's a wonder I haven't worn it out).
B000001FKY|5.0|I first heard songs from HYSTERIA back in 1988, and along with Van Halen > OU812 was the album that got me into hard rock. This is still my all time favorite CD!!! Why do rock critics consistently overlook this musical gem??? So what if the lyrics are dumb and the production too slick! There is nothing else in recorded music like it past, present and future!!! Look at the numbers - 3 years, 2 re-recordings, 5 million British pounds, 12 tracks, 63 minutes, 7 hit singles, 6 of them going top 20 including a number one hit (\\"Love Bites\\"), 15 million copies sold, 3 years on the Billboard Top 200, one of the ten best selling albums in 1988/1989, a sold out world tour playing in the round - I could go on and on!!! And all of this in spite of all the [stuff] that they had to put up with - drummer Rick Allen's car accident which cost him his arm and guitarist Steve Clark's battle with alcohol (R.I.P. - Steamin' Steve). To anyone who reads this article - go buy, find or borrow a big stereo, buy a copy of HYSTERIA, press play and see, hear, feel and experience what I'm talking about. Furthermore, why is there no digitally remastered reissue of not just HYSTERIA but all of their classic albums, and especially for HYSTERIA, a deluxe edition with remixes, outtakes, b-sides and live tracks, and a DVD-Audio version remastered in 5.1 surround sound (by the way, it baffles me that Def Leppard would put out a DVD about the making of the album, but no digitally remastered reissue - what's the hold up?) Anyway, despite the naysayers who say this album is a pop sellout and the production is too-slick (they don't know what their talking about), I love the SOUND, which is what HYSTERIA is all about, because it's THE BEST-SOUNDING ALBUM EVER MADE!!! Yes, better than PYROMANIA, BACK IN BLACK, BOSTON, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and METALLICA combined!!!
B000002GF8|5.0|How nice to see an album sell a bajillion copies, while at the same time pushing the envelope of what pop music can be.  Almost 20 years later, this still sounds incredible.  The lyrics have even more meaning nowadays, more so than to my 13 year old brain back then.  &quot;Tea in the Sahara&quot; and &quot;Walking in Your Footsteps,&quot; though not hits from the album have lost none of their luster with age.  Sting has an amazing ability to write songs that LAST!!  We're lucky to have him around.
B00006690F|5.0|So Here we go again, man he has out done himself this time. This cd is by far the best he has done to date. he has so many good joints on it and it has songs with Dr dre, dre, his daughter halliey and more. D 12 has had the luck of meeting eminem when they did to hook up with Eminem. Most people dont know he is in The group D 12. I gave this five stars. Its the best cd out right now. Dont bootleg it go buy it.
B000002IOW|3.0|To me, \\"Presto\\" is the same album as \\"Roll The Bones\\" but without the added benefit of sure-fire radio-friendly hits.  Both were produced by Rupert Hine, and his sparse treble-heavy approach (guitars chime more than cruch, drums click more than thump, bass is audible but muted, synths are present but not overwhelming) defined the sound of both of those albums.  But where as RTB contained some instantly catchy tunes like \\"Dreamline\\", \\"Ghost of a Chance\\" and the title track, the material on \\"Presto\\" has to be listened to a few times to fully absorb this new 90's-model Rush.  For that reason, it probably appeals to longtime Rush fans more than it's made-for-radio successor (I happen to prefer RTB myself).  <br />Overall, Rush has emphasized melody more with each passing release since their first big mainstream breakthrough \\"Permanent Waves\\" back in 1980.  This album seems to continue that streak, focusing more on quality songwriting than simply using a song strucutre as a foundation for the intricate multi-time-signature jamming that they've been known for.  It's these kinds of shifts in direction that divide fans of Rush old and new, but it's also these shifts that ensure the band will always HAVE fans both old and new, and not just the former.
0385484518|4.0|This book made me see death in a different way. Before I was scared of the thought of dying. Morrie, somehow made me more relaxed, and I have accepted death as a normal part of life. I can only hope that I will die with as much dignity as Morrie. I will vow to live my life with compassion for other people. I will try to live my life as if it were my last day. I owe a great deal to the experiences Morrie went through, without his experiences, I would not have learned these valuble lessons.
B000066F6H|5.0|This cd is practically flawless.  The first time I heard Die Alright I thought The New Bomb Turks finally scored a hit.  True they sound very similar, but the Hives are great and this cd is worth the money.  If you're into this style, pick up The Turks Destroy Oh Boy, it's just as good as this.
B000002UJQ|5.0|writing about this album is like talking about love - impossible! it's something that you need to feel and therefore i'm gonna write only one thing: this piece of art is amazing. if you don't have it, go and buy it right now. you won't regret it, trust me.
0764005685|5.0|I think this movie is the most fantastic horror movie ever!<br />The story is about a jung girl(Jennifer Connelly) who goes to a girl school in Sweitzh. She gets in kontact with a professor(Dnald Pleasence) Who is studding insects.Jennifer allso got the abillety to comunitate with insects so she and the professor join up to capture a insane killer who is somewere in the forests.If you love horror movies you have to atleast see this movie.It is problary one of the worlds graitest horror movie.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|A refreshingly honest story about friendship, integrity, learning and growing. The leading actors Connery and Brown are wonderfully believable but so are the supporting actors. Those playing Jamal's family and friends in the Bronx, and those portraying the teachers and students in his new upper crust prep school. It all comes together making it the most heartwarming film I've seen in a long time. A film not to rent but to own and watch again and again.
B000002ADT|5.0|Much has been said about this exquisite work of art that need not be repeated here. Even if you are not a big fan of jazz music, this album is a creative masterpiece that you must experience at least once. Odds are, after hearing it, you will join the millions of fans throughout the world who declare this as one of the most popular jazz albums of all time. And if your tastes in music are more mainstream rock and roll, keep in mind that VH1's list of the top 100 albums of the rock and roll era includes this masterpiece at number 66 - ahead of some great albums by the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix. Kind of Blue really is that good.<br />If you are intereseted in the history behind the album, look for Ashley Kahn's \\"Kind Of Blue - The Making of the Miles Davis Masterpiece\\" - the book serves as extensive liner notes.
B000002GQE|5.0|Who would have guessed in 1967 that \\"Days of Future Passed\\" would be one of the most subtly influencial albums of the rock era. To this day, many people do not realize that many rock artists have been influenced by this album. I suspect that some rock artists do not want to admit this album's influence.<br />The Beatles were heavily influenced by classical music, and over time they increased the level of orchestration in their music. Many of the songs on their last albums were supported by orchestra of various sizes. However, The Moody Blues went beyond orchestrating music in this album, they tried to fuse the two together, and were very successful at it.<br />Even more remarkable is that this concept album was recorded a mere five months after the release of the first rock concept album, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".  While there has been a great deal of discussion regarding whether \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was truly a concept album, there is no doubt that \\"Days of Future Passed\\" was a concept album.  The common theme is one day, from morning to night (\\"Nights in White Satin\\").  Thus far, however, I've not heard anyone ever suggest that \\"Days of Future Passed\\" was the first real rock concept album, perhaps because too many people consider them pretentious and overblown.<br />The music is a little dated, but no more dated than most of the other rock from the 1960s. Furthermore, there are several cuts that have survived the test of time very well, most especially \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" (Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?) and \\"Nights in White Satin.\\" So much has been written about these two songs that I can add nothing, so on to a couple of lesser discussed songs.<br />\\"Peak Hour\\" is probably the most anachronistic of the group, and feels very much like a product of the 1960s. The rest of the songs, likely very progressive rock in the 1960's, have aged to the point where they sound like light rock or easy listening. However, most of the songs on the second side (which includes \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Night in White Satin\\") retain a melancholy and flavor that makes this album very unique. Try listening to \\"(Evening) Time to Get Away\\" by John Lodge and not get nostalgic. \\"The Sunset,\\" an acceptable song by Mike Pinder follows, which itself is followed by a Ray Thomas song, \\"Twilight Time.\\" I enjoy every one of these songs and have listened to each hundreds of times. Some things just never age.<br />This album is not for everyone. If your idea of music if 4 or 5 males or females singing a throwaway tune that no one will remember in three years, or you like music screamed into your ears to the point where you can't understand the lyrics, then you won't like this album. Think Beatles with a flavor of Yes and maybe a little King Crimson for good measure. But think about a group that had these attributes before Yes and King Crimson hit their stride, and during the time The Beatles were just getting into heavily orchestrated rock. This album should always be considered influencial seminal rock and a hint of things to come in the late 60s into the 70s.\\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Night in White Satin\\") retain a melancholy and flavor that makes this album very unique.

B00003CX9S|5.0|This film which is one of my favorite director, David Lynchs, is made of monochrome film and talks about real story, John Merrick who was suffering from rare and incurable disease. First of all, the point is that this film is a black-and-white picture, which is extraordinary. It is probably, because the appearance of John is quite shocking and dreadful. So he is called The Elephant Man. When he has treated cruelly at the circus as he was seeing his body to the audience, he met Dr. Frederick who helped him to escape from his life like a hell. At this point, it is disprovable why Dr. Frederick helped him. He would be able to think John for an experiment. However, he is relieved of curiosity at his first sight and he becomes to be attracted by his humanity. At last, he thinks deeply and truly about the human dignity. In conclusion, this film talks about the human dignity. Although John was physically disabled person who has a gruesome figure, he was warm-hearted and pure man who really loves a literature. However, people are just surprised at his appearance, they would not have a conversation with him. This film is dealing with a pure heart man who has lived his whole life with peoples prejudice. Compared with other David Lynchs films, it emphasizes dramatic construction, because it is probably like a biography of John Merrick. In this point, it is a unique film as David Lynch who usually has made a film with a peculiar style and atmosphere such as Eraserhead which is similar to this film in a monochrome film and weird scenes. this is the most gentle film for David Lynch who always has a specific style which makes audience to understand a film very delicately, so it is easy to understand. It is because story takes the central place in this film that it is not so difficult to understand. Excellent directing, and what is more, performance of John Hurt who played in role John Merrick, and Anthony Hopkins who played in role Dr. Frederick, both of themare outstanding. It is a film worth watching.

6305014140|4.0|The ninja scroll is a decent movie well worth the watch but I don't see why everyone raves about it. I mean it's good and all, good action good characters and a extremely complicated story but it doesn't live up to classics like princess mononoke and Akira. I recommend it but don't expect anything ground breaking.<br />Other movies to see if you liked this one: Wrath of the ninja and samurai X.
B0000399WI|5.0|Forrest who? The Academy got it wrong. The best movie of 1994 was \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" with \\"Pulp Fiction\\" a close second. The sequence in which Andy's secrets are revealed qualifies as one of the five most thrilling movie sequences I have ever watched. Nevertheless, the Hollywood moneymaking machinery spurned this movie in strict accordance to the golden rule, \\"Thou shalt not give the Best Picture Oscar to a commercial failure.\\" At the time the movie was seen as a failure because it had not broken even during its theatrical release, but as millions of movie buffs around the world will enthusiastically remind you, \\"Shawshank\\" honored its message about the value of patience and endurance, by becoming a runaway word-of-mouth hit on video.<BR>I bought this movie on Laserdisc on an impulse, six and a half years ago, although I had not seen it and knew almost nothing about it. That was the most fortunate gamble I ever made. Now that I have practically discarded my old Laserdisc player, I bought myself a copy of \\"Shawshank\\" on DVD from Amazon. It holds a place of honor in my collection.
B00006690F|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've ever listened to.  I don't even like Eminem, but I really enjoyed this CD.

B00005YXZH|5.0|When I first got this disk, I thought it was a great album.  The more I've listened to it, the more I've grown to love it.  I now have realized how good this album really is.  Wilco has come a long way and they have grown to become very accomplished musicians. This album is proof enough.  If you're someone that's open to music, you will love this disc.  The disc as a whole is a beautifully crafted piece of art that you can only begin to believe with the first listen.  I suggest putting this disc on and listening to it with headphones, while reading the lyrics along with the songs.  When this album is over you will feel like you were part of something extraordinary and will be on here writing a review similar to mine.  If you are someone that is not a music fanatic and just listen to what's popular on your current bubblegum pop radio station.  Don't even bother. This is is a gift for people that are doubting excellent albums can still be made.  Thanks Wilco.
B0000009RT|5.0|\\"Freak Out!\\" is quite possibly the first truly solid rock, or rock'n'roll, album( impressively their Debut album).
B00005YXZH|5.0|It saddens me that some people are not going to buy this album because of some of the reviews it's been getting.  I wonder how someone could not apprecite this album.  Granted it's one of those albums that just keep getting better everytime you listen to it, so you might not love it at first, but what gives.  I then look at some of the music that these bad reviewers listen to and it all clicks in.  You have to have a strong passion for music to understand this album.  By seeing some of these bands that they listen to, I realize that they haven't even began to realize what music is all about.  This album is it.  This album is a whole.  A great artistic piece of work.  If I were you I'd buy it, and by the end of the first week that you own it, you'll love it.  I definately do and it's been awhile since I've been this satisfied and surprised by an album.  Wilco proves to me that I can still have faith that there is great music out there that touches you like nothing else can.

B00004S6GL|4.0|The first Elliot Smith album that I owned was Either/Or, which I might say is his, by far, best album.  When I bought this album I was expecting something as good as that album, and in my opinion this is not as good.  However, it's still an excellent album.  It's alittle more poppy, then Either/Or, and that's just fine. If you like Elliot Smith, you'll like this album, but if you're expecting Either/Or, that it is not.
0844663662|4.0|Those who have read any of Vonneguts other books will recognize teh light humor and unique way in which he writes them, although in this book parts are funny but its like your almost afraid to laugh. Slaughter house five is about an ordinary man although some expraordinary things happen to him, and his experiences. How he daels with his experience with the fire bombing at Dresdon, his wife, daughter and some other some what normal happenings. Although it is not only about his encounters on earth but also when he travled to another planet. The real reason why this book is unique is because of something that Vonnegut explains early on in the book which is that the main character is &quot;unstuck in time&quot;. That is all it says and after you read more it becomes more clear exactly what that sentence means.
B00006690F|5.0|I've always been impressed with Eminem's incredible lyricism and rapping skills and this album is just more of a reason why he is one of the best MC's ever. Every track is different, unique, and creative. You also see a different side of Eminem, Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers on a few tracks. I definitely recommend this album...it's fantastic! You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKEC|5.0|Rookie narc Jake Hoyt's \\"training day\\" is his 1st day on the LAPD.  He is clueless as to what to expect, regarding good & evil as it pertains to his work.  Therefore, he cannot respond correctly, and uses the only sensibility available to him: the ability to reason, and he does so as a man of high integrity.  This is the main thread around which the whole movie is woven.  Training Day clarifies how the line between right and wrong can get blurred, for different people, as well as in different circumstances.  \\"Bone\\" (Cle \\"Shahid\\" Sloan) is an awesome natural for his part, and cute, too.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love John Mayer, and I also love Dave Matthews. I do believe that they both fit under the same category per say, but John Mayer is not trying to copy Dave and I think that type of stigma is not fair to place upon him. John's lyrics are amazing. Trully spoken, image invoking, emotion fillied, and honest. I don't think that there is a song on the CD that I don't like. There is something amazing about a 24 year old from Georgia making damn good music. In an industry which breeds one hit wonders, and bronzed up hard bodies for the pure gratification of selling stuff, it's very refreshing to hear a new voice. One where the music is created from the soul, and is relative to everyones life. John Mayer's music may be similiar to Dave Matthews, but he still has undeniable talent. Talent which will be able to transcend through genertations and the years to come. I can't wait for another CD!
0345413377|4.0|Pullman did not let his readers down with the final book of His Dark Materials, The Amber Spyglass.  The plot gets interesting from the first pages of the book, and picks up right where its predecessor, The Subtle Knife, trails off.  The plot is very intense and provides for hundreds of pages of good reading.  Pullman has created a masterpiece of a conclusion to his fantastic trilogy.  <BR> Even though the plot is very exciting, it is too slow-moving to receive a five-star rating.  Some chapters were tedious to read even though the plot was good.  Pullman went way too in depth in some areas, such as the chapter about the Constitorial Court of Discipline's descision to kill Lyra.  It is woven with a complex and suspenseful plot, but a chapter of boring description in the middle of a heated story makes for a difficult read.  This is also the case with Pullman's descriptions of the Mulefa, the wheeled beasts Dr. Mary Malone encounters.  At times, it seemed as though Pullman was simply trying to add length to his concluding novel simply for the sake of making a longer read.  This actually detracted from his plot and made it less exciting.<BR> All in all, The Amber Spyglass is definitely worth reading.  Pullman creates an unbelievable amount of suspense when he reveals that Lyra will have to make a descision deciding the fate of the world.  Pullman uses great language and a complex plot just as in the first two novels of the trilogy to create his ending piece.  Even if it moves slower than its predecessors, you should read The Amber Spyglass and discover Pullman's closure to His Dark Materials.
B00005LC3Y|3.0|Kubrick is a phony, a fake and a sham.  Do not believe the hype folks, Kubrick at his best is a mediocre film-maker. Don't believe me, then u should watch A.I.  Despite Spielberg's attempt to salvage the project, the movie still turns out to be absolute garbage with great cinematography.  Full Metal Jacket is only worth watching right until the end of boot camp, basically the first half-hour or so. After boot-camp, comes the war scenes.  Here, Kubrick attempts to be an insightful and original director.  This futile excercise only insults the inteligence of any individual possessing an I.Q higher than that of a senile goat.  There is almost no character development in this movie therefore one is always left guessing the motive behind the 80% of the actions of the characters.  The movie does not end it simply stops.  After it stops, you realize the movie really had no point and Kubrick is no Tarantino.  However I still bought the DVD because of the phenomenal performance of Lee Hermey who plays the drill instructor.
0060934913|5.0|This is a very entertaining read. Its exploration of a subculture is reminiscent of Samuel Fussell's personal journey through the world of bodybuilding in his book, &quot;Confessions of An Unlikely Bodybuilder&quot;.<br />Kitchen Confidential is written in the first person, without literary pretension or concessions to established conventions of the memoir. It's really oral storytelling at its best. Although the book is very much Bourdain's experience in the world of culinary commerce it's scope is as wide as any anthropological thesis, dealing comprehensively with topics such as language, ethnicity, apprenticeship, status and mores.<br />Highly recommended.
B00004Z459|2.0|i was the first one to buy this cd back in 2000. My friend told me about them. It was tight until &quot;in the end&quot; wa played every ------ hour of the day on the good radio stations. GIve me a break, it gets old and even worse when seriously overplayed on the radio. If your friend offers it, go for 6 bucks or lower.
B0000668IF|5.0|It has been a long time since I enjoyed a CD as much as Moby's 18.

As I listen to the CD I find myself singing and swaying and leaving the world behind me...
0380977281|4.0|This book begins with the story of Dunstan Thorn, but it's really the story of his son, Tristan.  Tristan is only half human, but he doesn't know that.  His mother comes from beyond the Wall, and Dunstan could've loved her and chose instead to live a more normal life in the town of Wall.  Tristan knows only that Victoria Forester is the most beautiful girl in the world.  Although it's fairly obvious Victoria isn't interested in him, he believes that he will win her hand in marriage if he brings her the star they saw fall.  In order to find it, he has to go beyond the Wall (something no one in his town has ever done).  During his journey he meets many strange and often frightening beings and discovers that the star isn't quite what he thought it was.<br />This story has a lovely fairy tale feel, which I mostly enjoyed.  However, because it was written so that it feels like a fairy tale, it has some of the same sort of drawbacks a fairy tale has.  None of the characters are ever really developed that well.  You get to know the characers just well enough that you can come to like them and maybe even care about what happens to them, but they don't feel as three-dimensional as I know Neil Gaiman could make them.  Although that occasionally irked me, I found myself getting caught up enough in the story that, for the most part, I didn't care.  Tristan was an idiot who managed to grow up as the story progressed, and I loved the star.  The romance was a bit weak, but it didn't show up out of the blue.  Although a lot of the story was predictable, Gaiman kept it interesting with a strange assortment of beings.  The way he tied everything together was wonderful (although it almost felt TOO clever and nearly...cute - especially his solution to \\"a week when two Mondays come together\\").
B00004XQ83|5.0|Great songs, great artists.  Of course the movie is not meant as a model to live our lives, but the songs speak to certain situations. It is nice to listen to...brings out the emotion of a time gone by.
B000001IPL|5.0|Ok, I'm going to be short and to the point. This CD is the best out of all the Offspring CDs, possibly their high point in their musical career. Although a couple songs (What Happened to You and Killboy Powerhead) were bad in my tastes, you'd have to hate punk rock not to buy this album. Much better than their more recent albums and actually carries decent messages. I still can't believe how Offspring went from this great, fast, loud album to \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\", \\"Americana\\", and \\"Conspiracy of One\\", which are more pop than anything...
B00005JL3A|5.0|I know the critics didn't like this movie but I feel Resident Evil got a bad rap. I think this is a great movie with great acting and is an extremely polished film. The music is creepy and the storyline is decent. I don't care what Ebert says about the film- after all- I am my own critic and I don't listen film critics. Film critics said Star Wars was horrible too when it opened in 1977. At least this movie tried to use a plot to attract viewers and not topless bimbo's and ugly gore.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana Krall is a good singer although I think she is over rated.  This album is ok but it can be better.  The only track that I really liked on this one was The Look of Love... but Sergio Mendez' 60s version was probably still better.  Don't get me wrong, she's good but I think Christy Baron is better..... but, I'd still recommend you buy this one.
0790729989|5.0|Is it not amazing that even when you know the narrative and plot inside out you can  watch a film again and again. That's why we fans collect films I suppose. Se7en is the best thriller i have ever seen and is ever likely to be.  I saw it first uncut at the cinema and then many times both on TV and DVD. ... the poor customer was forced at gunpoint to have sex with the prostitute and he was made to wear a ghastly contraption that was like a terrible dagger - I leave the rest to your imagination.  The  camera shots of the photos shown of this crime scene were so quick that you need to be very observant to catch the drift.That's why the poor guy was in such a state of shock.<BR>Terrific story line and I truly believe one of the most shocking and unexpected endings that i have ever seen. How well John Doe's manipulation of the character of David Mills  fulfilled the only ending possible.  I enjoyed the way Sommerset was researching the work of Dante in order to try to solve the crime.I sat in the cinema quite numb, barely believing how cleverly David Fincher had led me in a direction that I was not expecting and was annoyed with myself that I did not see it coming. ... Very brave of the director to take that route and that's why he is so good. We need more films like this to kepe alive the great thrill of movie viewing.  ... <BR>I don't think that you can fault this film.  For its genre it surpasses everything. Freeman and Pitt together were foils to one another and no I don't think that Paltrow needed a more developed role, her part in the movie was just right.<BR>...often talking about violent acts has more impact than showing them, and this is why Se7en is so effective.<BR>For those of you who have not had the privilege of seeing this movie, hire it asap or better still buy it!
1559408855|4.0|\\"Salo\\" is most certainly one of the most controversial films of all time.  With an eye sensitive to horrific imagery, it is easy to fall into a trap and see the imagery for only what it is, as opposed to what it represents.  For, the power of \\"Salo\\" is to be seen in the relentless metaphor that it contains.  Once one knows a couple of basic hints it becomes far easier to peel off the layers of disgust to reveal the true essence of this powerful film.<br />The basic characters fall into several archetypes:<BR>1) The 4 Men: represent the fascist rule that dominated Italy during the Nazi rule.  Given more power than they should have, they are content to savage the people they rule over with no respect for the humanity that they have been given control over.<BR>2) The teens: the victims of this fascist control (the Jews of the Holocaust, the Italian people, etc.) who quickly lose all their dignity and rights under such savage treatment.  Escape appears to be only a couple of steps away and seems quite easy; yet, for these individuals, it is impossible.<BR>3) The madams: The politicians that (although not participating directly in most of the exploitation of the populace) provide the direction and desire to commit such crimes to humanity.  Easily recognizable, they are just a step below the 4 men in the line of power.<BR>4) The soldiers: the populace of Germany/Italy who allowed these atrocities to go on.  Witnessing the entire situation as it escalates (much like it did in Nazi Germany), these people fall under the Nazi spell.  For them, it is impossible to sympathize with individuals that have been so debased, so no guilt is felt on their part for the crimes they are involved in.<BR>5) The piano player: the populace of Germany/Italy who allow the atrocities to go on, but eventually become aware of the horrors that they have helped cause.  Inevitably, rather than direct their guilt externally to change the system, these individuals internalize it upon themselves.<BR>6)The viewer: as an individual watching this movie, the viewer is being asked by Pasolini what side they are going to fall one: the soldier or the piano player?  Are we to feel sympathy for these violated teens or are we to look at their plight with the same detached lack of interest as the soldiers?<br />Thus, Pasolini has created a large allegory that can be seen in today's light, as well as those of WW II.  Essentially, these archetypes are applicable to most any situation in the world where individuals are being exploited...and this is Pasolini's message.  As individuals outside the loop (viewers) we possess the ability to evaluate the scene and react in a way that can alleviate or enhance the scenario, it is up to us to decide.<br />A word about the imagery: This too is an essential aspect of \\"Salo;\\" for, in its relentless onslaught, Pasolini is trying to tell us something.  Once upon a time imagery like that of the Holocaust in WWII was capable of shocking the populace of the world (as it was REAL); however, much of humanity has become desensitized to this.  Pasolini is trying to offend us with the imagery of this movie in order to parallel how we SHOULD be offended by the imagery of the Holocaust.  He is showing us these atrocities without \\"Hollywoodizing\\" them (try \\"Schindler's List\\" for that)...these are images we cannot deny and they are based on reality.  Humanity is capable of tremendous horror and through the imagery of \\"Salo,\\" Pasolini is forcing us to acknowledge a side of our species that we have lost sight of over time.<br />In this fashion, \\"Salo\\" is an exploration on the psychology of mass fascism.  Not only are the soldiers placed under the spell due to the debasement of the people that are being exploited, but the exploited individuals are turned against themselves to continue to live (one particular scene is \\"Salo\\" articulates this perfectly).  Promises of \\"freedom\\" that are never delivered also helps to keep these individuals in line.  This masspsychology is evident throughout \\"Salo;\\" for, there are ample chances to attempt escape, but all are kept in line with minimal effort.<br />Finally, a quick word about the ending (I will keep this vague so as not to spoil it for those that have not seen it): Pasolini is telling us that, in the end, we have become so desensitized to the horrors that surround us that we are all inevitably the soldier archetype.  No longer able to see the suffering that surrounds us, we are dancing right along with the 4 Men...although perhaps not directly involved, we see all that is going on and help allow it to happen through our lack of action.  Pasolini is describing humanity's fate here and forcing us to confront it so that, perhaps, something can be done to change it.<br />This movie is one that is NOT recommended to potential viewers unless they see this movie for the imagery it represents.  Contrary to what many will tell you, this movie is NOT a dark comedy and is, indeed, as dark and relentless as they come.  Again, the imagery is RELENTLESS...be prepared if you decide to see this; after all, the imagery is only a fraction as disturbing as what it represents.<br />Hope that helps...
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is what I have waited for a long while, it pleases my taste for great lyrics, well constructed rhythms and riffs, and a great singer that doesn't always scream his lyrics.  This album is extremely long, mainly with instrumentals, but it gets the job well done in every respect.  The concept for this album is very unique compared to other artists in the same supposed field as Tool, with unique album art and with simple credits on the transparent case, this album was clearly meant to make a statement, and it succeeds very well.  The first songs; The Grudge, The Patient, and Scism definitly are worth listening to, though the other songs are great, these three are the main power houses of the album.  The only problem that plaques this album is that Maynard Keenan is often too soft in singing or his voice is overshadowed by the guitar, bass, and drums, making it very difficult to hear him sing or make out the words in the song. Over all this album is worth a good investment of money into it and deserves to be listened to thoroughly.
B000066C1N|4.0|Since this movie had barely any talking and a lot of singing.. you really have to listen to the words of the songs to determine the story.. I felt this was an awesome CD.  Bryan Adams did a fantastic job and the writting on this CD was fabulous.  I can't say that every song was wonderful but on a whole I rate it one of his best ever..
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle was the first book by Vonnegut I'd read, and I was definitely not disappointed.  Unlike a real, \\"empty\\" cat's cradle, this book was filled with irony, wit, and hard truths about society that ring true even (especially?) today.  If Cat's Cradle wasn't so damn funny, it would be chilling ... his end-of-the-world scenerio is devastatingly simple enough to be real.  Amidst this tale of impending doom, Vonnegut makes the reader think about religion, politics, and science with an increasingly cynical outlook.<br />This is an amazing book and a fast read.  Give Cat's Cradle a shot if you have the chance: you won't regret it!
B00006690F|2.0|This album is completely unsurprising, and there is no reason to buy it.  Anyone familiar with the Marshall Mathers LP will find nothing new in this album.  Anyone that listens to the radio has already heard half of it 300 times.  Anyone that has the internet has already downloaded it a month ago.<br />There are some people like this, I guess.  I call these people sheep; the record execs call these people ideal consumers.  Either way, Eminem has nothing new to say, and certainly nothing important.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I listen to every kind of music (except my son's choice of head banging gut wrenching audio-abortions), and Room for Squares is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time.  I played it in my car to/from work every day for 6 weeks now.  I've never tired of listening to it, and have been constantly redescovering new facets.  My favourite song keeps changing - I like them all now.  It is a great mix of styles and lyrical expressions guaranteed to paint wonderful pictures and emotional images.  Buy it now, and thank yourself for weeks to come!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I wish everyone who wrote a bad review of this CD listened to it more than once. It is a very very hard CD to like at first. But then it grabs you and doesn't let go. Unbelieveable stuff. The only low point (and it's not very low) is Heavy Metal Drummer, which doesn't seem to fit in, but is a great pop song on it's own. Just an great CD.
B00006690F|5.0|THE EMINEM SHOW IS PROBABLY THE MOST ANTICIPATED CD OF THE SUMMER AND NOW THAT IT IS OUT....AND BOY IS IT OUT!<br />WHAT THE ALBUM LACKS IN ORIGINAL BEATS IT MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR IN EVERYTHING ELSE. TO BE HONEST...ALMOST EVERY SONG'S RHYTHMS AND MELODIES ARE NOTE FOR NOTE FROM SONGS FROM THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP AND THE SLIM SHADY ALBUM. NOT THAT THIS IS A BAD THING. BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HEAR SOME ORIGINAL SOUNDS TO GO ALONG WITH THE BRUTAL AND BRILLIANT LYRICS ON THE NEW ALBUM.<br />AFTER HEARING THE SONGS ON THE EMINEM SHOW IT IS QUITE APPARENT THAT THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN DARK AND SCAREY FOR MARSHALL.<br />WHERE HIS LYRICS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DARK AND VIOLENT, THIS TIME THERE IS A MUCH DEEPER SENSE THAT IS PERSONAL. THAT THE EVENTS WITH HIS MOTHER AND DIVORCE FROM HIS WIFE KIM HAVE HAD A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE RAGING ID INSIDE THE EM.<br />IS THIS A GOOD ALBUM? NO.<br />IT IS A BRILLIANT ALBUM. AS MUCH FOR IT'S PRODUCTION AND STYLE AS IT IS FOR IT'S RAW HUMANITY.<br />BUY THIS CD. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
B00006690F|5.0|This is a great CD.  I especially like cleaning out my closet and the final song my dad's so crazy, which featrues his little girl Hallie Jade.  I really liked this CD and I would recommend it to all.  I hope everyone enjoys this CD as much as I did.  The only down side to this is I feel the CD will be very played out by the end of the summer.
B00000K0DV|2.0|Sleazy best describes this Fulci slasher about a madman running around New York City killing people (especially pretty ladies) in loving, graphic detail.<br />The killer quacks like a duck.  No joke.  To be honest, the most disturbing thing about this flick is not the gore or any real scares (there are none) but the story behind the childlike quacking, etc.<br />Gore?  Sure.  But you've seen just as good gore in better context and better films.  I have to give MUCH credit to the throat slashing scene where the POV is from INSIDE a victim's throat as it is sliced open, so that we see the killer and then the dripping blood.  Sounds sick and kind of is, but very stylish.  Kudos.<br />Otherwise, we get Jack Hedley, looking like he's killing time between AA meetings or something walking around New York without any real urgency to catch the killer.<br />The film is [inexpensive], low budget, and has that sleazy feel--you know, the one where you feel guilty for having spent 2 hours watching something like this.  But to be honest, you've seen sleaze in more effective films, most notably MANIAC from a couple of years earlier.  At least that film was the story of Joe Spinell and a heck of a creepy performance.<br />This DVD is for Fulci fans for sure.  Otherwise, a rental to the curious.  Oh, and of course, it's infamous.  Apparently this required a police escort out of Britain years ago(!)  So the infamy boosts the interest, and there's your market.  Indulge, video-nasty buffs.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Finally one of the nice guy bands puts out a product that will propel them to where they need to be. \\"Never Again\\" reminds me that these guys are a rock band. \\"How You Remind Me\\" is one of the most fluid songs I've ever heard. Great album. Not all that powerful live...but what the [heck]
0345413377|3.0|This trilogy was great in the first two books although this one was rather disappointing. Pullman had created a wonderful world of magic and alternate worlds, of action and romance, but this book was offensive to Christians and was just to cheesy with all the love and heartbreak that the main characters Will and Lyra experienced. The two go to a world where dead people go and free them they also say that there is no god, but the first angel apparently called himself god and claimed to create the rest of them. Will and Lyra then take the ghosts from the world of the dead and all the dead people just turn into molecules. It slaughters the book when Pullman tries to make fun of Christians. The love between Will and Lyra lasts for the last few pages then they must leave each other since they are from different worlds, boo-hoo. One thing that doesn't make sense in this book is when all the ghosts evaporate some stay behind to help Lyra's dad fight heavens forces. if the ghosts evaporate how can some stay behind to fight? Pullman must have been to eager to finish this book and just didn't care. he really should have made a better ending for it, it simply ends with Will and Lyra heartbroken and stuck next to each other, but worlds aparate, it just doesn't seem like a it gives enough closure. This last book was really a bad ending to the trilogy although it did have some good times it just wasn't the same as the first two.
B00006690F|5.0|Fantastic Eminem, you have done it again.  The first time I listened to the album, i walked away in a state of shock.. which is what I believe Eminem would like us to do!!  Best album of them all.  Congrats!
B000002J1S|5.0|This one excellent cd. It has some outstanding material on it. The only I ever heard form it on the radio was the title track which is really good, but don't just buy it for the title track because it contains some of genesis best material. I actually think the second cd is better than the first especially the first five songs on it well put togehter and really good i.e liily white lilth to the Lamia. The title track on the first side and the number called counting out time are the best on the first cd. I f you have never picked up this cd do yourself a favor and get it
B000068CNX|4.0|After the success of the first season on DVD, we could only expect this to be announced as quickly as possible by Warner Home Video.  The second season of \\"Friends\\" was brought to viewers with a settled pre-existing foundation.  The first season developed each character inch-by-inch until we were ready to root for Ross and Rachel to get together.  In a wonderfully conceived cliffhanger to season one we were left questioning the outcome to Rachel's bold move at the airport.<br />When season two picked up, we found out that Ross was going to be a tougher catch than Rachel thought.  This made for quality television when Rachel began to flirt with Ross in blatant attempt at winning his affection.  Once Rachel accidently announces to Ross that she has fallen for him, he is presented with the incredibly difficult decision between Julie and Rachel.  He's had a crush on Rachel since high school, but he's gotten serious with Julie.  That too is accompanied by good writing and classic moments in the \\"Friends\\" (and \\"Mad About You\\") universe.  For all fans of \\"Friends\\", we've known for years how these predicaments turn out, and we also anticipate the eventual relationship between Ross and Rachel in this season.<br />This season is full of quotable dialogue and memorable situations.  It easily ranks up there as one of the best \\"Friends\\" seasons.  The first one started it all, and we are forever in the creators' debt for that, but as the series progressed so did the writing and the actors' performances.<br />This season houses many classic escapades such as when we find out that Phoebe is married to a Canadian ice skater (who she once thought was gay), when Ross finds out about Rachel's reciprical desire when she says, \\"I'm over you\\"(in which he replies, \\"You're over me?  When were you under me?\\"), the hilarious prom video that reflects on the Geller's past (and proves to Rachel that Ross has always felt something for her), the star-studded two-parter that aired around the superbowl(featuring Brooke Shields, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Julia Roberts), when Monica starts dating Richard (played by Tom Selick), and when Joey moves out and is replaced by the annoying and potentially psychotic roommate Eddie.<br />It's all here, and complemented by some nice looking extras.  The two commentary tracks will definitely provide us with anecdotes up the wazoo and the tour of Monica and Rachel's apartment will be just as informative as was the tour of Central Perk on the season one DVD.  On top of that, you get every episode in their uncut form.<br />I'm an assured fan of \\"Friends\\" and am eagerly awaiting this box-set, which arrives on September 3rd.  If you enjoyed the first season on DVD, I suggest you reserve a copy of \\"Friends - The Complete Second Season\\" now.  For anyone who hasn't seen the second season of \\"Friends\\" before during its television run, this won't disappoint.
B00006690F|4.0|I had my doubts but Em surpassed the LP with the Show. Starting off with the angry White America, all questions about whether Em has gone soft in his success are put to rest. Goes on to the tight Dre track Business, hits some hard emotions with Cleaning out my Closet. Soldier is a cool rock-rap thats way too addictive. Goodbye Hollywood is a hilarious comment on all the bad \\"My hollywood life\\" pop songs. I can imagine some record producer whispering Em to do a song about his Hollywood experience, then getting this in return. Without Me is light dumb fun, the Real Slim Shady of the album. Fun single, but one of the weaker ones on the album. Sing for the Moment feels a little derivative and poppy at first but the lyrics are so strong it actually works, one of the best on the album. Anyway, sort of gives you hope that the TRLization of music may not be its death after all when Mathers music can hit the top of the charts. Its smart, emotional, and addictive stuff. Who knows where this guy will be 5 years from now, but he's managed to mature as an artist with each album. Put the hype aside, this is a must-listen.
B00003CXWV|1.0|Oh Lordy, where does one start? I believe that first of all every movie should be taken at its face value. Whatever the makers of BLOW may claim, their final product is a smoothed-over attempt to create sympathy for one of the most evil men to ever inhabit the USA. This is not surprising since it is undeniable that many of the people involved in making this movie were themselves avid customers of the odious Mr. Jung. <br />Purported to be a biography of George Jung, major cocaine dealer and purveyor of horror and death to thousands of people, the final result is simply a thinly disguised attempt to make people feel sorry for this hideous sub-human creature. If creating a sympathetic public perception of the evil Mr. Jung was not a purpose of this movie, then why were all the details about his philandering, perversions and abuse ignored? Read Jung's biography and you will see just how far the moviemakers had to hide the truth to create their propaganda piece for Jung.<br />With the most contorted \\"logic\\" imaginable (and a very strong helping of pop-psychology and the usual excuses for all sorts of criminal activities) George's life of crime is somehow all the fault of his mother! Why some in Hollywood love to shift personal responsibilty for criminal actions on others says an awful lot about the movie-makers themselves. Millions of people the world over have childhoods far worse than Mr. Jung and the vast majority somehow find honest means to achieve personal success. Why should Jung get a pass because because his mother was mean to him sometimes? Whose mother wasn't? Misogyny is ascendant here.<br />Why should we feel sorry for Jung because his daughter refuses to visit him in prison? Did the director think that there would be a flood of public sympathy for Jung, forcing his daughter to communicate with him? Who knows? But if your father had deserted you through much of your childhood because he was psychotically compulsed to import and sell poison to America's youth I think that many of you would want little or nothing to do with the guy as well.<br />Some think that Jung has only gotten what he deserved. I believe that should he be executed by slow torture a hundred times he would not have made even a down-payment for what he has done.<br />This movie demonstrates very glaringly the extent of the acceptance of insane criminal conduct amongst the Hollyood elitists.
B000002G1Y|4.0|This is probably the most rock-oriented album John hiatt has made.  There is a sloppy, hard-rocking, Crazy Horse feel to a lot of the songs.  He also mixes in a few slower songs, and there are his usual clever lyrics throughout.  The title song and &quot;Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari&quot; are both a lot of fun.  &quot;Old Habits&quot; is a great bluesy song that seems ripe to be covered by one of the blues greats.
0425152251|5.0|I just have to say that those of you who are putting the book down really don't understand the meaning of the book.  Sophie's World is meant to open new areas of thinking to the reader who may not have ever explored Philosohy if not for this book.  I am 14 and found the book fascinating.  Remember, the wisest man knows he knows nothing at all.  You all obviously are NOT wise.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem has always been about not caring about anything and just trying to cause controversey. Well, he's still going to be causing controversey, but he definitely shows weakness in this album. He shows hate, anger, and love in this very powerful album. If you're expecting the same old Eminem, you've got another thing coming. Let's get to the song reviews.<br />White America - A-: This is a great song, it's a pillar to the fact that America still doesn't get it. He's letting all the parents know he was out to prove to the world how many parents out there just aren't parents.<br />Business - C-: The album quickly hits a low point with this song, this is one of the many songs that make you feel like being tortured by having to sit through it. Eminem has good lyrics, but as long as he's not saying anything, this one just gets lame.<br />Cleaning Out My Closet - A++: This is probably the strongest song he's ever done. It's a message to all about the true situation with his mom. A very powerful song. He shows one weakness right here... his hate for his parents.<br />Square Dance - B-: Another song taking a jab at those that criticize him. There are quite a lot of these.<br />Soldier - B+: This is honestly a song that can scare you under the right circumstances. Eminem has a lot of anger over losing his ex-wife, Kim, and in this song, he really displays that.<br />Say Goodbye To Hollywood - C+: Can't figure this one out myself. It's alright... not the best he's done though. Wait, he hates hollywood... hell, what celebrity doesn't?<br />Drips - D-: I'm sorry, there's no reason for this song to exist. It's lame.<br />Without Me - A-: A throwback to the true Eminem we've come to know. Though, if you think about it, this guy is a true schizo. There's Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers, and Eminem. Pick your favorite flavor!<br />Sing For The Moment - B+: Eminem's version of the hit by Aerosmith, Dream On. I honestly enjoy this song a lot. I don't know what it is, but he's able to always sound so passionate about everything.<br />Superman - C+: This is kind of a weird song, cause it makes no real sense. I guess he's just still angry with women after Kim.<br />Hailie's Song - B-: This song really shows his love for his daughter... another weakness of his. Possibly though, seeing these weaknesses will bring a more artistic and human feel to his work. I'm honestly liking this side of Mr. Mathers.<br />When The Music Stops - F: The only really bad song on this album. It's just a boring one, and you'll most likely skip it.<br />Say What You Say - F+: I can't get into his songs that he writes for rappers he hates. Jermaine Dupri is really horrible, but not worth a song.<br />'Till I Collapse - A: I feel the desperation of this song. He conveys emotion so well.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy - B+: This is honestly quite funny. He gets his daughter on the track, and it's really cute and disturbing at the same time... and that's why I like it.<br />So, in coclusion, buy it. Eminem really does get much better with each album. Of course, he also gets a bit more twisted each album too... he's an artist, what do you want? It's the same way Jonathan Davis sounds a bit more sucidal with each CD. Artist just exploit their demons for money... which is a wonderful way to deal with it, in my opinion. At least he's not out there shooting people.
B00005UDFZ|4.0|This is an excellent DVD.  I however was expecting what I had seen a few years back on PBS.  In that version there was far more tension between Carreras and Bernstein.  Carreras, whom I believe had just found out he had leukaemia, walked out in the middle of rehearsal after Bernstein picked him apart.  Although there is not all that tension present in this DVD, it is still a good look inside the making of this recording.  Watching the performance of the singers, musicians, and Bernstein is a far better treat then just listening to them on a CD.  I do believe it has been whitewashed by removing a lot of the tense moments which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
0618002227|4.0|&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is a great fantasy book that takes you into the lives of hobbits, dwarves, elves, dark lords, and many other very exciting characters.  I enjoyed reading this book a lot.  It was very exciting and had me hooked from the first chapter.  The story is about a very powerful ring, made by a dark lord, that has fallen into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, who must travel to far lands to destroy it.  The story tells of all the adventures he has on the way.  The only complaint I had about this book is that it could get kind of slow during the traveling scenes.  This pace did not last for very long however and it was right back to being exciting.  Great book, everyone should read it.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Very rarely does a band come along that I will listen to, let alone follow religiously.  Back when &quot;Du Hast&quot; came out, I automatically knew it was a phenomenal concoction of techno, hardcore, and thematics. However, I had some reservations about buying Sehnsucht.  At the time, I wasn't into a lot of hardcore music, let alone anything to the caliber of Rammstein. One day, I just decided to buy the album and haven't regretted.  When I found out Rammstein was releasing a new album, Mutter, I got excited. I went out and bought it the first day I could.  Over time, I listened to the music and the lyrics, oblivious to their English translations. When I looked online at the translation, I was blown away at their use of poetry and grotesqueness in such songs as &quot;Mein Herz Brennt,&quot; &quot;Mutter,&quot; and &quot;Nebel.&quot;  No joke, I actually teared up reading the lyrics while listening to the backup symphony and multifaceted elements to each song.  Mutter is definitely a must buy.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this  CD. It's  soft, it's mellow, it's really something original. Her voice is like no other. I think Norah has a long career in front of her and I can't wait for her next CD as I've worn out this first one by playing it over and over and over and over...
B00000JCOV|3.0|This album for the most part is very good.  I think however it lacks structure.  Of course, Eyeless is the exception.  Damn do they get that song right.  The drumming on this thing is phenomenal, as is the playing overall.  I just wish there was more to the songs than crazed playing.  More songs like Eyeless would put this band in my top 10 list.
0060931736|4.0|I read The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie because it was on the Modern Library List of the greatest novels of the 20th Century, and I knew it was pretty short. I thought it would be interesting to see why it made that list. As it turns out, I think The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is one of the books which earned its place on that list.<br />The novel concerns Miss Brodie and here five students. She has chosen these five in order to craft them into her image. Miss Brodie is a spinster and wants to live her life through them. Miss Brodie imparts all of her views on them even though they conflict with the more conservative views of the school. Miss Brodie's views are very liberal. She is very frank when talking to her students about her sexual liasons, and she encourages some of them to become sexually active with a male teacher. Miss Brodie is also a fascist, and she tries to impart these views on the students, too. In the end, you see the ways in which she has influenced her students.<br />The novel is really superb. I seems to comment on the how ideals can be taken too far and can be checked. Miss Brodie also seems to represent Calvinism and Fascism. She contrasts Miss Brodie's position with the school's more conservative positions. The novel is written in superb prose (I'm not sure why people complain). The repetitions in the prose are there for a reason (to represent propaganda). The characterizations, particularly of Miss Brodie and Sandy, are apt. It's really a graceful novel with a lot to say (much of which I agree with). It's definitely thought provoking and very worth a read.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I really enjoy listening to this album. Its nice background music. Very soothing and romantic. Her voice has a melodic quality to it like other great jazz artists.
B00006690F|5.0|The Eminem Show in a word is Awesome. Who can deny Slim Shady of extremely good lyrical skills? No one. From the minute people heard of the completion of this LP, they knew this was THE album to get this spring/summer. That's what we have all come to love about Marshall Mathers. When he drops a CD, we know it's satisfaction guaranteed. How many artists can give us that feeling nowadays? Only a handful or maybe even less. And without a single doubt, Eminem is one of those artists.<br />From the beginning, on \\"White America\\", which by the way, is the albums highlight, we all get that refreshing feeling that we are blessed to hear arguably the top hip-hop artist of today on some much needed good music. This song is what Eminem is all about. Displaying his lyrics like no other rapper and telling us what we want to hear, his inner most feelings.<br />\\"Business\\" is a hit we can all enjoy with hip-hop's top producer on the beats. Witty, funny, creative lyrics over a tight Andre Young beat. Eminem's Batman to his Robin. Arguably the best one-two punch in hip-hop history. The track that follows, \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\", is the second best track as we hear Marshall dishing out his most personal feelings to date over a beat. \\"Square Dance\\" is sure to create yet another beef in the rap game. This time it's Slim Shady himself versus Canibus. Many people had doubted Eminem's guts as he only dissed pop acts. But now, he has officially dissed a rapper. A black rapper. We shall see how Canibus responds. Canabis is not going to let this slide. That's a guarantee. Marshall is upset at Canabis because Canabis used Em's character from his Marshall Mathers LP, Stan, to his benefit on his [wack] album, C True Hollywood Stories.<br />Other slammin' tracks include his lead single, \\"Without Me\\", which needs no explanation since everyone has heard it by this time. It's not possible to review this CD and not mention Eminem's singing, yes, SINGING, on a tribute to his daughter, \\"Hailie's Song\\". No, Slim is not a good singer, yet the track comes out smooth and lovely. \\"Say What You Say\\" finds Eminem playing Dr. Dre's devils advocate on a diss song aimed a hip-hop producer/rapper, Jermaine Dupri. It's a classic diss song. The content of this song stems from Jermaine Dupri stating that he (himself) is hip-hop's untouchable top producer. A statement Dre and Timbaland (Extravagant hip-hop producer) didn't take lightly. It was a sign of disrespect.<br />Rounding out the album is \\"'Till I Collapse\\" featuring the lovable Nate Dogg. Using a beat similar to Queens \\"We Will Rock You\\", Em is again on top of his game. Marshall mentions other rappers that he has the utmost respect for (Reggie [Redman], Jay-Z, 2pac, Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jadakiss, Kurupt and Nas). Can't argue with that! \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" features none other than Eminem's own daughter, the cute Hailie Jade playfully stating that her dad is crazy. Over a hot Dr. Dre beat, this one is a dope song.<br />Now comes the bad. \\"Drips\\" featuring the Shady Record's own, Obie Trice, is not that great. It sounds like something out of the Slim Shady LP, which isn't necessarily bad, but it IS when Eminem is at a bigger level than he was in 1998. \\"When the Music Stops\\" featuring the not-so-great rappers, D12, is a flat out filler cut. The ONLY filler cut on this album. Nothing against Bizarre from D12, but c'mon, even a mute person raps better than this guy. He doesn't even attempt to rap. He just talks slowly. Think he earned his recording contract? I don't think so. You think if Eminem weren't in the rap game this guy would never EVER get a recording contract? I think so. And what's with Proof always whispering? Use your regular voice for God's sake!<br />Even though this LP has a couple of OK songs, even those can grow on you. Not only is this CD good, it's great. Eminem is arguably hip-hop's top rapper, the only other rapper contending for the title would be Jay-Z. A \\"Renegade Part 2\\" would have been awesome on here. Eminem has the potential to be one of hip-hop's top leading producers also as he produced all but three songs on this disc. The sad thing is, there might be a day when Slim does not need Dr. Dre anymore. The way things are going, when Eminems contract is up, he will record on his own label, Shady Records. I'm sure Dre will still hook him up with beats. Marshall has grown A LOT since he came in the rap game. His lashes against his own mother alone is unique in the music business. Most rappers praise their moms instead of berating them. Jay-Z, Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Snoop Dogg, Warren G, and a few other rappers \\"love their mommas.\\" Em also disses his dad whom left Marshall's life when he was a baby. Now this is more common amongst rappers. WC and the Madd Circle, Beanie Sigel, 2pac, and more have all laid out their frustrations against their fathers. The Eminem Show will most likely be the top selling cd of the year. Not only because it's filled with shock value tagged along with controversy, but because Marshall Mathers is arguably the hardest working lyricist in hip-hop. One can not listen to this album and deny this young man's talent. Two other things are very, very, obvious upon listening to this LP: His unconditional ever-lasting love for the person he treasures the most in the world, little Hailie Jade Mathers, and how big of an inspiration the late, great, Tupac Shakur is in Em's life. I counted about five 2pac references in this cd. There might be more. Slim Shady does not give a you know what whether you like him or not. All he wants is your respect. And damn it, he deserves it, and guess what? He most certainly is going to get it whether you want to give it to him or not. Mrs. Mathers' baby boy wouldn't want it any other way.
0790729601|5.0|U.S. marshals protect people who have messed up in their life and are then 'erased' to start a new life. The best marshal is John Krueger (savior of the human race, Arnold Schwarzenegger) has just been assigned to protect the beautiful Vanessa Williams because she uncovered the new phase gun developed by her company. James Cromwell makes a brief appearance, but commits suicide in a second. It was grisly! After many attempts to get rid of Williams, Krueger saves her life and erases her whole life. Friends of Krueger turn on him and want to get rid of Williams, but he doesn't let that happen! Nobody betrays the immortal genius! Krueger pretends to be a balloon delivery man, jumps out of an airplane, cooks alligator meat, and picks up two phase guns (which must weigh a thousand pounds) and has no mercy for the crooked agents. The Herculean force is the only person in the world that could lift those enormous weapons and the fight between he and James Caan is vehement! A classic to remember forever for Schwarzenegger fans!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Usually when people buy CD's sometimes some songs on the CD's you want to skip over because you don't like them. I for one thing love the Beatles but when I listened to \\"Beatles One\\" it was really amazing. The CD's has hits of all number one songs by the Beatles from the early days of \\"Love me do\\" to their later years of \\"The Long and Winding road\\". I love this CD because it has all number one songs on it and in my opinion it DOES show how the Beatles changed in music. In the beginning their music consisted of simple lyrics and 3rd person type of songs that lasted about 2 minutes (think of the songs 1-10) I love those songs a lot. And you can tell the Beatles changed in their music by writing more personally like \\"The ballad of john&Yoko\\" and longer songs that were about 4+ minutes.(think of songs 23-27). Those songs are brillant also.<BR>    I think is a great CD and for those of you who like the Beatles you'll appreciate and LOVE this CD. If you don't you must not love the Beatles as much as most people. My favorite songs are....nevermind i love all their songs actually. I was trying to list my favorite but I relized I LOVE all their songs on this CD in different ways. <BR>Favorite Ringo song on this CD: (he only sings one) Yellow Submarine<BR>Favorite George song: Something<BR>Favorite Paul song: Let it be (though some prefer \\"Yesterday\\")and Hello, Goodbye<BR>Favorite John song: Come together, Help!<br />I love this Cd and I know most die-hard Beatle fans out there will too. I think it is well worth the [price] you have to buy it for since it is generations of music into one CD and it last you a long time. <BR>The Beatles were a very talented group that were amazing! Everyone knew the Beatles and loved them. People still do now. My mother loved them when she was young and now I do now. Todays music does not at all compare to the Beatles. <BR> You should really get yourself a copy of this CD if you love any of the Beatles music whether it be later years or early years. I strongly recommend this CD to any Beatles fan and anyone who wishes to become one, this is a great CD to listen to first!
0446678430|1.0|This book is long on cliches and hype, and frustratingly short on specifics. Even though the print is large and the ideas simplistic, its rambling style, arrogant boasting, and redundancy make it a surprisingly difficult read, and in the end, the reader will be no closer to understanding on how to actually make enough money to do as the title says.<br />Kiyosaki's legal and tax advice is in general extremely vague, and this is probably a good thing, as the advice his does get specific on is impractical, outdated, or illegal. Worse, this book appears to be more a work of fiction than anything else. Kiyosaki's anecdotes about his own career are at times contradictory, and the dates don't match. And the Honolulu Star-Bulletin was unable to identify who \\"Rich Dad\\" could possibly be, despite Kiyosaki's claims of how rich and famous he is in Hawaii. It is quite probable that he is also a work of fiction (check out Kiyosaki's disclaimer at the front of the book).<br />Kiyosaki is much more a (poor) motivational guru than a serious financial advisor, as anyone who has seen him hustling his products on his infomercials can attest to. In case you've missed his informercials, never fear. At the back of this book are pages of ads for his products, including his $200 (!) board game. One has to wonder how seriously to take a financial advice book that seems to be more of a marketing tool, designed to make Kiyosaki, rather than the reader, rich.
B000059HCN|5.0|I really thought director Aronofsky used his cinematic tricks to keep \\"Pi\\" interesting just so the viewer would not notice a really weak story. With this film, the director finally finds material suited to his style, creating a harrowing journey about drug addiction that makes \\"Drugstore Cowboy\\" and \\"Panic in Needle Park\\" look like Muppet movies.<br />Ellen Burstyn is a TV junkie who gets hooked on speed while trying to lose weight. Her son and his gorgeous spoiled girlfriend are hooked on heroin, and spend most of the film trying to score more drugs. The entire film is watching these lives spiral out of control, with the final thirty minutes, where everyone hits rock bottom, being the most intense, hard to watch scenes ever put on film.<br />Burstyn shows she still has it, and should have beat Julia Roberts' cleavage for the Oscar. Jared Leto makes you forget \\"My So-Called Life,\\" and every other role he has had where he is the dreamy eyed high schooler all the girls want to date. Marlon Wayans, as Leto's best friend, takes the kind of turn from comedy to drama that must have Jim Carrey pulling his hair out in jealousy. Jennifer Connelly, one of the most beautiful actresses working today, proves she is not just another pretty face in a very difficult, humiliating role.<br />I saw the uncut director's version of this, and I see why Artisan released it unrated. This is an amazing film, and I look forward to Aronofsky's next work...with a little trepidation.<br />The unrated version contains strong physical violence, gun violence, some sexual violence, strong profanity, strong female nudity, some male nudity, very strong sexual content, strong sexual references, strong drug abuse, strong drug references, and strong adult situations.
B00006690F|5.0|Out of all three of Marshall's cds, the eminem show is the best yet.   i personally love the song bout his baby girl. For a rapper marshall actually suprised me at his singing.  I also think \\"my dad's gone crazy\\" feat.  his baby is to cute.   But you can tell that he's grown up since he's last cd.  I think everyone should buy it and listen to his lyrics before you judge him.  after listing to this cd you realize that he's not such a bad guy like the media says that he is, otherwise he wouldn't be such a loving father.
B00004Y62T|4.0|I am not a huge fan of the Matt Damon-Ben Affleck-Gwyneth Paltrow triumvirate. Paltrow comes off as a ditz in most of her films, her entire repertoire consisting of a coy grin (like Julia Roberts). Affleck does not know how to act, as I have watched him bring down entire films like \\"Chasing Amy\\" and \\"Reindeer Games.\\" He cowrote an Oscar winning script, he just cannot pick one to star in. Damon comes off best of the three. His Will Hunting was very good, and I think he has more acting talent in his toothy grin than Robert Redford does in his entire weathered body.<br />\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is Damon's film. He should get kudos for playing the kind of part (gay psycho) that most heart throbs whose careers are stalled on the WB would never even consider. This is a brave followup to \\"Good Will Hunting.\\"<br />Damon is hired by a wealthy ship builder to go to Italy to retrieve his spoiled son (played by Jude Law). Law is partying it up with girlpal Paltrow and another rich expatriate Hoffman. Things go awry when Damon wants to be like Law so bad he murders him and assumes his identity, with former friends and police hot on his trail.<br />Anthony Minghella does a better job directing than scripting here. Sure, nice Italian scenery (not many directors could foul that up), but the moments of violence are still shocking, and the cinematography is perfect. His script, however, is bland. All of his \\"society\\" characters are bland. Ripley's motivations and obvious mental illness just never gel. I always got the sense that Damon was told to hold back, when in fact intelligent psychotic killers have been around on film for years. The movie should have been right at two hours, instead of the protracted ending on the boat (with literally a handful of shots where I expected the credits to roll). Cate Blanchett's character also defies logic, as her character pops up to complicate Ripley's life about three times too often.<br />Damon, and an oily Phillip Seymour Hoffman are excellent. Jude Law lets his accent slip a bit here and there, but is good. Paltrow plays a socialite extremely well, and all the beautiful people are surrounded by beautiful scenery. I recommend this film, especially over Minghella's leaden \\"The English Patient.\\"<br />This was rated (R) for physical violence, some gore, profanity, some male nudity, some sexual content, some sexual references, and some adult situations.
0553381687|5.0|Winter is coming...and in this haunting refrain, a new fantasy series is born that breaks the boundaries yet stays in them so seamlessly, the beauty of it is breathtaking. Mr. Martin creates a surreal world so like our own and yet so different, irresistible with its colorful personalities that are parts of us all. Who will survive in the richly woven tapestry of honor, humanity, and betrayal? The answers may surprise you, for it is not necessarily the most noble, the strongest, or the most-deserving. Felicitations to Mr. Martin for creating an engrossing, moving, and refreshing tale. Highly recommended.
B00006690F|5.0|This cd is great, anyone who likes eminem or just rap will<BR>enjoy this cd. Its got great songs along with some cool skits.<BR>Most the songs are good to listen, the best of course is Without Me. But unlike other cds where some songs are good and some bad. This cd all the songs are good and enjoyable. The extra DVD isn't much though, i bought and was a litle dissapointed. It doesn't include much of anything exept some old songs and videos. But if your an eminem fan this is the cd for you.
B00003CXAY|5.0|reat movie - great visuals, great music, but the message of the movie was somewhat ridiculous...<br /> If you can get past the message (and the only reason you would know it from this film when they spell it out at the beginning by defining and translating the meaning of the title) this movie is very entertaining to watch.  It just shows strange and fun stuff in either super slow motion or hyper-speed - I have no qualms about purchasing this and enjoying the visual experience over and over again.  I did have a Laser disc copy of it many years ago, it was damaged and not replaceable until now.  I anxiously await the release of the DVD.    <br />Excellent visuals and excellent music.  It's worth the price of admission.
B00005T7I1|4.0|Dick Tracy was one of the few movies that stayed true to the comic book and comic strip.  When viewing the movie, it's as if you're right in the comic strip because the visuals are very stylish and flawless.  This was a very good movie, and I remember seeing it in the theater many many years ago.  I was surprised to learn that the DVD came out not too long ago!<BR>But I think the reason for the delay of the DVD occured because Dick Tracy, even though the movie made $100 million at the box office and was praised by critics, it was viewed by the mainstream public at large as a failure.  The marketing and merchandising for Dick Tracy rankled a lot of people, this because Batman did the same thing a year before.  What's more, Dick Tracy does not have much of a fanbase as, let's say, Spider Man or Batman.  Still, it is one of my favorite movies and does full justice to a comic book.
B00000K19E|5.0|The effects of this movie were ground breaking and can be seen in other movies
B00001W9G0|1.0|I am apparently the only person in the land that thought this movie was terrible.  Shame on the universe for letting these two put together such a mawkish, insipidly gut wrenching film as this.  The plight of these two people is apparent, but neither soul is even tolerable.<br />I reached the end of the movie glad for the suffering I had witnessed, wishing only that further misery and spiritual punishment could somehow be levied on the characters.  If Amnesty International were truly interested in reducing injustice in this world, they would take up the cross of seeing that this movie never again saw the light of day.
B000065U1N|4.0|Okay first off, the movie is fantastic.  I absolutely loved this movie, but however was somewhat dissapointed.  Ever since hearing about the book \\"Black Hawk Down\\" a few years ago I read everything I could about the incident.  So going in to see the movie I was really looking forward to how they would portray it.<br />Ridley Scott did a wonderful job with the combat scenes, especially the mix of sound and visuals of the black hawks and little birds flying to the LZ.  The anticipation and tension is built up perfectly at this point.  Overall the movie was great, and the score by Hans Zimmer really added to the emotional effect of the film.<br />What was wrong with this movie?  Some of the scenes of course were \\"re worked\\" for dramatic effect.  The way the two delta snipers were killed is not exactly how it happend in real life. They touched on how the soldiers were unprepared, but I felt they should devote more time to it.  YOu couldn't really tell who was who at times.  The only person I always picked out was Ewan McGregor and Josh Hartnett, the other soldiers could have been extras.  But isn't that how war is?  You just don't know, and everything is not clear.<br />The timing of this movie is a bit ironic.  Every person I know who saw the movie walked out of it saying how much they wanted to Kill every Somalian they knew, so from a propoganda view point the movie succedded.  However, this was a true event (Granted the politics of EXACTLY why US troopers were there was left out, ,because after all this was for entertainment purposes, not a documentary).  Also to some viewers who complain their weren't enough black or hispanics or asians fighting with the U.S soldiers,  umm theres a reason, there weren't many on Task Force Ranger.  These are the same people who complain that Saving Private Ryan didn't have any blacks in it.  Well from my recollection of HIstory, the military was still segregated in world war 2 so there wouldnt be blacks in the particular group shownin the movie.<br />I will say one thing about this movie though.  A buddy of mine has always refused to fight for his country.  He was completely anti-war and would completely dodge the draft if it ever came down to that.  Now, I am not the most pro-american in this country, but I realize what we have, and im proud to be an american, but I would fight for my country. After seeing this movie my buddy finally changed his mind, so I am happy to see he has seen the light.<br />So in conclusion, see this movie.  If not for the visuals, for the emotions, for the amazing action sequences, see it for the men who died.  Soldiers do not get to choose what to do, they are given orders and they follow them, or face prison time, it's that simple.  So for the 18 men who lost their lives over nothing, HooWa.
B0000029GA|5.0|Old school or new school, the rap buck stops at &quot;Illmatic.&quot; What makes &quot;Illmatic&quot; the greatest rap of all time? For one, it is the total package. The production on this album is top-of-the-line. The beats perfectly complement Nas' wordplay and help to emphasize the &quot;trife life&quot; of the streets. Even more amazing that the beats are the lyrics that Nasty Nas graces us with. No one paints a picture like Nas does on this album.<br />In a time when, out of 15 songs, an album may have 2 or 3 good ones, &quot;Illmatic&quot; is even more amazing in that it has only 10 songs and each one of them is a rap classic. Each one has infinite replayability on its own but, put together, they go together flawlessly, giving the impression that you are listening to one giant song. As if it wasn't spectacular enough, Nas carries 95% of the album by himself. Unlike most recent rap releases that features 5 different &quot;guest&quot; rappers on each song, only one song (&quot;Life's A B*&amp;(#&quot;) features a verse from anyone other than Nas (in this case, it's AZ). Even in that case, the rappers complement each other so well it's eerie.<br />I could go on and have a more detailed review of each of the songs but the fact of the matter is this: if you don't have &quot;Illmatic&quot; you shouldn't be reading this review, you should be out buying it right now and listening to it. You'll thank me for not wasting your time.
B000002KDS|5.0|Killer rivals the intensity of the hardest rock bands in existence.  &quot;You Drive Me Nervous&quot; packs more of a punch than most heavy metal bands, &quot;Halo of Flies&quot; can only be dreampt of by any progressive metal band, and &quot;Dead Babies&quot; is more gothic than any goth band or Alice immitator could ever create.  In all, this is the album that marks the Alice Cooper Group as a force to be reckoned with.  It's dark, it's heavy, and it's creative.  What more could you want from a rock album?  I also find Killer raw enough to rank alongside Appetite for Destruction as one of rock's gems.  This is good stuff, folks.
0684833395|5.0|Usually I prefer shorter novels, ones in the 200-300 page range. However, at the recommendation of my friend, I decided to give Catch-22 and it's 450+ pages a chance. Looking back, I can't thank my friend enough for this recommendation.<br />Catch-22 follows the people and events surrounding one Captain Yossarian, a World War II bombadier stationed off Italy. All he wants to do is live while, through his eyes, everyone wants to kill him. Even the people on his side are out to kill him. As the number of missions he must fly keeps rising, Yossarian keeps coming up with new ways to avoid his inevitable death.<br />This book is littered with a cournicopia of interesting characters. Each one gets their own chapter (and in some cases, multiple chapters) and Joseph Heller manages to mesh them all together to form an interesting (albeit sometimes hard to follow) plot. At first it seems like the book isn't going to really go anywhere but before you know it, it's there.<br />This book gave me a good chuckle on numerous occassions. Whether it was one of Yossarian's crazy schemes to get sent home or the officers' constant struggle to gain recognition (and promotion), there is never a dull moment.
B00006690G|5.0|WOW! He did it again! To all those people who don't have dvd players and/or have not already downloaded the cd off KaZaA you should buy this one! From the curtains up till the curtains close you will be mesmorised by the amout of different lyrics he used in the album...I enjoy the songs without me, the slow Hailie's song and White america but many other are good as well. Another plus is that eminem got rid of that boring PSAs telling that his album will shock you regular people (duh)and added what his success has been over the years. This is one to remember! go buy it!
0345339681|5.0|The face of literature changed forever with the publication of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the prequel novel to the epic fantasy \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" With the release of three blockbuster films based on that trilogy, new attention is also being paid to \\"The Hobbit.\\" While not the deepest or most epic of Tolkien's creations, this tale is enchantingly and expertly written, with a thoroughly sympathetic cast of characters and a delightful plot that intertwines deeply with \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br />Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit, a member of a race of small, large-eating, peaceful creatures, very much like humans, with hairy feet and a distrust of adventures. But Bilbo's life is unexpectedly turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf, with thirteen dwarves in tow. They eat Bilbo's food, take over his cozy hobbit-hole (a subterranean dwelling -- \\"Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort\\"), and generally make life difficult for him.<br />But Bilbo soon finds out why: these dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, who slaughtered its inhabitants and stole their treasure. Now, led by Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves intend to take back what is theirs -- and Gandalf wants Bilbo to come along. Bilbo doesn't particularly want to go, but the adventure appeals to a quirky, adventurous side of him. Before he knows what has happened, he is on a rollicking adventure filled with malevolent goblins, a degenerated creature with a magical Ring, Elves both friendly and unfriendly, enormous eagles, savage wolves (also called wargs), and giant carnivorous spiders. But even if Bilbo can get past these dangers, he must still deal with the malevolent Smaug in his mountain fortress. <br />Many people have fond memories of reading \\"The Hobbit\\" as children (including part of the LOTR movie cast). This is definitely a children's book in some ways, but most children can't pick up on the subtle character developments and the nuanced foreshadowing. \\"The Hobbit\\" is not merely an entertaining story or a delightful prequel, but also a masterful piece of fiction.<br />If nephew Frodo Baggins is the ultimate \\"little guy\\" hero, then Bilbo is the ultimate reluctant hero. Bilbo is almost perfectly happy in his respectably dull life, but his very small yearning for adventure is evident from the very beginning. Though he is not the sort of person that you would classify as being a hero, Bilbo grows gradually and subtlely in courage and ingenuity. Only on the very last pages does the reader realize just how much Bilbo has changed.<br />Gandalf is a more nebulous figure in this book than he is in LOTR, and displays much of the \\"crotchety gray wizard\\" archetype that he formed in fantasy literature. Thorin Oakenshield displays the endearing and annoying traits of dwarves, dating back to the Prose Edda: He's proud and sometimes a little obnoxious, but also fiercely loyal, honorable and extremely brave. The other dwarves are not featured as much individually (after all, there are twelve) but retain individual characteristics that never become jumbled or confused.<br />Tolkien's writing style is somewhat in keeping with a bedtime story (which this once was) and a children's story. He had apparently mastered a very rare gift, that of being able to address the reader without sounding cutesy or smug. The descriptions are very evocative, especially when he describes action scenes. The dialogue is enchantingly written, managing to be fairly realistic while never being boringly so.<br />Like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"The Hobbit\\" is influenced by mythology and a previous work of fiction. The goblins (later orcs) are somewhat reminicent of George MacDonald's goblins; as Tolkien read and enjoyed some of MacDonald's works, this is unsurprising. Additionally, the names of Gandalf and almost all the dwarves can be found in Norse legends. The impact is subtler than that in LOTR, presumably since Tolkien's children were too young to appreciate any influences.<br />\\"The Hobbit\\" remains a classic that can be read and enjoyed by children and adults alike, possibly even more enjoyable now than when it was first written. Before you read \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" be sure to check out its enchanting prequel.
630575067X|4.0|&quot;Every saga has a beginning&quot;<br />The beginning of most movies is dull since it has to set up character relationships, and with the way each trilogy ends up being like one long movie it isn't surprising that this could have been better as far as being a self-contained movie, but it was truthful to its tagline, and despite some logic and plotflow problems certainly had me hooked for its entire duration in the theater.
B00000IPAX|2.0|While I do think that Blink 182 are three very talented individuals,all their songs tend to sound the same. When I went to the POP DISASTER TOUR and they came on stage me and my friend would be like &quot;hey I like this song..wait a minute...I don't know this one&quot; and we'd have to wait till they start singing to know which one it was. While i do like &quot;Adams Song&quot; and &quot;All the small things&quot; I would not recommend the C.D. The are a great radio band but I wouldn't buy the C.D.
B00006690G|5.0|eMINEM DISPLAYS ONCE AGAIN HIS TRUELY UNIQUE TALENT to rhyme on hot beats. He also adds personal tracks like cleanin out my closet, where he talks about his mother, saying he's sorry for all the distress he's  caused her.  And halies song, about his daughter and his very bad marage. Tracks like soldier definately came from the dirty south somewhere. Without me, his first uptempo single, is hot!. The skits are quite funny, and, finally eminem, has ditched the publick service announcements from the beginnings of his album!  The only bad part I could think of about this lp is that he try's, somewhat successfully, but still not that good, on hallies song, em, don't do it!<br />Can't rave enough about this album, it's the hottest!
B00005JKJA|1.0|To paraphase scrooge from dickens was this movie the result of some undigested italian meat that the director eat or as butch and the sundance kid would say \\"who are these guys\\".In my own words \\"what does that first coffee shop scene have to do with anything.Aside from naomi watts the movie, like the emperor ,has no clothes.
B00006690F|3.0|Eminem's first two albums were fun dirty songs with grooving beats you could dance to, but this album isn't funny and doesn't have any grooving beats. All the songs(minus \\"without me\\") are slow and depressing, not a rockin' groove or a clever joke to be found. I give him three starts for trying to do something different but hopefully he will get out of this slow period and start making dirty party records again!!!
B00006690G|5.0|After the first release, i didnt know what to expect from eminem. The second one was deffinately more than i had hoped for. Abrasive lyrics and insults flow rythmically from his mouth through a great collection of songs. Since getting it, I haven't had the desire to turn it off.
0316743003|4.0|Ben Rich's insights into the most successful cutting-edge aircraft development projects of the last half-century is must reading for aviation buffs and for those in charge of developing new technology.  A lot of valuable dos and don'ts can be found in these pages.  I would have liked more technical details on some points, but that's a nitpick.  As a defense consultant and an aerospace history writer, I found this a compelling read I couldn't put down.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Okay, this is a purely technical issue. My dvd skips all over the place and I was unable to view the entire movie, how frustrating! Guess I need to return it tomorrow. The dvd was also not very well planned as one is unable to view the deleted scenes without going through an awful lot of work. Very silly feature! Also, as usual, the dvd has a feature only accessible to people running windows. Why is there such a prejudice against Macintosh owners? Macs are often the computer of choice for people who make movies such as this one with plenty of special effects. Whomever produces these dvds really needs to consider the fact that we pay the same amount of money for the dvd and there is no excuse why all features aren't mac user-friendly. NO EXCUSE! <br />I do love the movie, but really wish they hadn't left out parts from the book. Hermione solved an important potions puzzle at the end of the novel and they completely skip that in the movie. Overall, a very good movie with a lot of imagination but dvd needs some work!
B000003BEM|5.0|\\"Beggars Banquet\\" is the most radical and shocking album in the Stones catalog.  Blowing apart the hazy dreaminess of their psychedelic contemporaries, the Stones return to their blues rock roots, practically inventing the hard rock formula in the process.  \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is one of the Stones most disturbing songs as is \\"Street Fighting Man\\".  In addition to these well-known anthems, the album runs the gamut from country blues (\\"No Expectations\\") to hard rock (\\"Stray Cat Blues\\") and everything in between.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I was actually pretty surprised with some of the tracks that Britney put out on this one...thing was, I thought there were gonna' be more club-bangers like \\"I'm a slave 4 u\\" and such. a lot of the tracks towards the end start to sound too much like stuff from her old albums, and from what I've read, it's supposed to be COMPLETELY different from her other albums, and I find myself getting lyrics mixed up because the songs sound SO much alike. otherwise, I enjoy some of it. good job, britney?
B000003BF1|5.0|\\"Let It Bleed\\" was the Stones dark soundtrack for the demise of the 60's utopian vision.  \\"Gimme Shelter\\", the opening song is pure genius; \\"Let It Bleed\\" is a sarcastic blues rock classic; \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is scary and primal and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" closes the album (and the Sixties) with a devastating scattershot exposing the degeneration of the flower power dream.  In short, \\"Let It Bleed\\" is some of the Stones most compelling and important music - and Keith Richards fans will not find a better collection of his guitar style.
0684830515|4.0|The Sun Also Rises is an even steadiness of style and description, settings and characters. The smart reader understands this book better.  After researching on Hemingway, I find that \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" reflects his life.  <BR>The characters are often drunks, who love to travel and take a very big interest in bullfighting.  It's a great book with many consequences that deal with human nature.  <BR>The love affairs and jealousy occurs with everyday life for some people.  Hemmingway's style of writing is not the \\"perfect style\\" that we read in every other book.  He uses a vulgar style. Hemingway has created these characters to be continuously frustrating and apparently beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them friendly, attractive, and people that every human being can relate to.  <BR> I enjoyed reading his book.  And for his first book, I would say that he did very well.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it own.  I am interested in the social life that happens in the book.  The love affairs, drunkenness, and racial comments are things we deal with or see everyday. The way he describes the different places, such as Paris is so simple and laid back, making the reader feel as though they are really there. He has a unique style.  This is an enjoyable book if you are interested in the lifestyle that these characters live.

0385503954|5.0|Vladimir Nabokov, in his lectures on literature at Cornell, told his students that \\"Style and structure are the essence of a book; great ideas are hogwash.\\"  I have no doubt VN would have greatly admired Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT. In short, the book is a luminous, finely crafted work of art, as exquisite - and fragile - as the vase which plays a crucial role in the plot.<br />Don't compare it to McEwan's other novels.  Forget BIRDSONG too.  Read ATONEMENT for what it is, and like many readers you will discover a masterpiece, a beautiful artifice that at its heart is also about  the act of writing itself.<br />And here's another tip from VN to heighten your reading pleasure: draw yourself a diagram of the household and grounds, and watch how McEwan artfully stage manages the comings and goings of his characters in part one.  What a delight.
B00003CXAY|5.0|... In 1988, the film was on tour with the Philip Glass orchestra playing the score LIVE! It was amazing, and has branded the film into my brain forever. I cannot wait to have Koyaanisqatsi on DVD; Powaqqatsi is definitely a bonus. Koyaanisqatsi is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen.
B00006690G|4.0|Each new album of Eminems i listnen to seems to increase in depth and emotion, not only that but each album is packed with new and better music. This album is slower than the previous ones yet has more emotion and anger. There are a few songs that show another side of him. Halies Song shows a caring side, something not properly seen before.<BR>If you liked the first two. You will love this
B00005QGAZ|5.0|And this wasn't even his best work!!! Lemme Tell you, I was a Junior in High School when \\"The Girl Is Mine...\\" first hit the airwaves, and I remember nights where I stayed up all night hoping the song would come on. I fondly recalled that moment in time as well as others while listening to this Remastered array of melodies.<br />From the Mamba-rhythmed \\"Wanna Be Startin'Something...\\" to the lusty, lovely \\"Lady In My Life...\\", there isn't a weak track on the ensemble. Nine awesome songs that would have all went top 10 if all released. (SEVEN DID!!! - Not a bad compromise.) <br />My favorites? The big three:<br />3) THRILLER - the spooky beat and Vincent Price's ghouly lyrics are the highlights to this top 4 song. And the video, now almost two decades old, is one of the best ever. <br />2) BEAT IT - This alternative cut was a killer!!! Simple lyrics that grabbed your attention. Couple that with Eddie Van Halen's soaring guitar solo and West Side Story like Video, ( I can still do the steps at 36.... SHHHH, Don't tell) and you can see why this song spent four weeks at number one in 1983. And it wasn't even the best cut on the album. That one was... <br />3) BILLIE JEAN - all you need to hear is N'dugu Chanceler's drumbeat, Louis Johnson's Bass line, Jerry Hey's arrangement and....WOW!!! Did you know that the instrumental to this terrifying cut was nominated for a Grammy back in 1983?? Can you still hear those violins in the background?? <br />And I haven't even mentioned the voice, all recorded in one amazing take. I can still picture his mechanical walk, spin, moonwalk and triple spin - toe freeze (Yeah, I can do that too...) that floored us all on Motown 25 as if it were yesterday. This one topped the charts for for two months, and after listening to it 20 years later, can you see why??? The Perfect masterpiece on a new flawless work!!!! Michael was Bad on this one....Ooops, that's the name of another album...
B000062TU1|1.0|DISC ONE.<br />Overall the movie looks great on this DVD.<br />Even though it's a pan and scan transfer, the movie still translates well, and none of the scenes really suffer for it.<br />DISC TWO.<br />Worst Extras Ever.<br />I'm sorry, but my life just isnt long enough to devote enough time to figuring out what the hell is going on here! How confusing is this interface.<br />I know it's primarily a kids DVD, but the information contained in this DVD is NOT readily accessible.<br />I know that's the point, that it's an adventure, etc, and the kids will love it.<br />But this kid found it a headache....<br />And where is the extra footage?? Is it really there?? I couldnt find it..
B00003CXXO|3.0|Maybe it was the confusion of which director's vision was supposed to come out.  Maybe it's the feeling I have that the ending should have been &quot;happier&quot;, although some can argue that it was a happy ending.  I'll try to express this without giving away too much, but I feel that the film goes through an awful lot of good things, only to leave me saying &quot;Huh?&quot; when it ended.<br />On the good side, Spielberg seems to have put as much effort into this film, both plot- and special-effects-wise as anything he's done.  The story begins in the near future, where lifelike, but unfeeling robots are commonplace.  William Hurt plays a scientist that wants to take it one step further and create robots that have feelings.  Done with good intentions, it is done to give people who can't have children of their own something to love that can respond to them.  This is, of course, when an old-fashioned puppy just won't do.  <br />So they make a robot that looks just like Haley Joel Osment, who is named David.  They try it on a family whose only son had been frozen after having an incurable disease.  These first moments are some of the best in the movie, as we can see reluctance, followed by acceptance, followed by something that comes pretty darn close to being love.  <br />Alas, a question is asked early in the movie.  If we create robots with feelings, then, do we as humans have a responsibility for those feelings?  This comes to a test when the frozen human son brought back to life and cured.  All of a sudden there is a lack of compatibilty between the human son and the robot.  Even though we lean towards the robot as more loveable, we can't just dump the original son, so the robot goes.  <br />At this point the movie has it's good points and bad points as David explores the world in search of a mother.  He is joined by his robot teddy bear, who is underused in the movie, and another robot, played by Jude Law, whose function is that of gigolo.  Here the creatorsof the movie get a free ride to show us the state of movie effects, and we get to see a political movement that doesn't like the robots.  While not uninteresting, I wish less could have been spent on effects, and more on character development.<br />I won't get into much spoiler detail here, except to say that an incredibly patient David just tugs at your heartstrings trying to fill his robot function, which is to love his mother.  I say incredibly patient, because a span of 2,000 years goes by at one point with his faith undeterred.  With all this effort put in, then comes the ending I thought was unsatisfying.  <br />Yes, one can debate whether it is a happy ending or not.  Technically, David SEEMS happy at the end, and he does technically reach his goal, but that's where the &quot;Huh?&quot; comes in.  I suppose if Kubrick had done it, the ending wouldn't have nearly been as upbeat as this one, and we should be grateful for some kind of Spielberg touch here.  But in a movie filled with an incredible amount of love, David deserves a lot more.  Even if he is just a robot.
B00000099Y|5.0|Let me start off by saying tool is my favorite band. This is probably(although it's close) their best CD. every single song on it is great. The way Tool gives increidible energy in every cd is awesome. They give anger and sarcasm and every other emotion, But they show it to you in a view you've never seen before. Its creepy tracks like \\"message to harry manback or Cesaro Summability just add to the albums powerful vibe. some highlights are Aenema, hooker with a penis, eulogy, and stinkfist. This is one of those weird Cds that gets better the more you listen to it. It may appear dull but at some point you just get it. I guarantee you WILL NOT be dissappointed. If you need lyrics or song menings try [URL].

B000066C1N|1.0|After listening to this soundtrack, I went into a dark corner and wept, because it was only at that point I realized how cruel the world can be, permitting this soundtrack to be released.<br />I can't imagine why anyone thought hiring a generic rock star from the early 90's would lend any sort of magic to the film, but it seems that Bryan Adams was hired against all odds to put out the most wretched of soundtracks ever conceived. Mr. Adams manages to make a mockery of the animated soundtrack industry by coming up with the worst possible rhymes and lyrics.  It was as though he mugged an eleven year old girl and stole her collection of poetry, then proceeding to put it into a computer and let it spit out a \\"melody\\" using only the highest-quality synthesizer tones and beats.<br />I'd like to send my regards to Hans Zimmer for having to allow his solid orchestral pieces to be sandwiched into this nightmarish collection of \\"songs.\\" Avoid this soundtrack at all costs, unless you enjoy contrived, plastic music.
B00006690F|5.0|I just got this album today and it is pretty good!

B000062TU1|3.0|Harry Potter the movie was medicore at best.I have not read any of the books but it is clear that Rowling &quot;studied&quot; Tolkien's work. Many of the characters and events in the movie are strangely similar to the Lord of the Rings. Not as original as i thought it would be...yet should be amusing to those who have not read or seen Lord of the Rings.
0553260111|5.0|I first read this book nearly 20 years ago and was mesmerized.  As I read about Jason Bourne I had a motion picture star in mind that I imagined playing the part in a movie. I was so disappointed when a TV movie came out with some wimp playing the lead role.  After seeing a trailer about the upcoming movie, I started cleaning out closets looking for my copy of the Bourne Identity.  It is still a remarkable read after all these years and I am looking forward to seeing the movie with someone in the role that could be believable.  I have read most of Robert Ludlum's novels and this one is my favorite.
B00005JKJA|1.0|If you really like this movie, either get it on VHS or wait for them to re-release it on DVD.  The people who produced this CD are obvious not familiar with DVDs because they made it in the form of a VCD.  In short, you cannot select different chapters in the movie.  In order to go to a specific scene, you have to use the fast scan.  This makes the disk even worse that VHS tapes because with tape, you can at least stop the movie and fast forward the movie to a time or counter mark.  I guess the makers were more focused on putting out little things like trailers or cast info instead of useability.  Because of the length of the movie, they could have made it a dual DVD set and put all of that extra ... on it.  Oh well, I am so glad that I am just renting this DVD and didn't buy it.  You all know what the store's policy is on returning items, even if they are ...!!!!
B00006690F|5.0|...Eminem happens to be my favorite rapper, and i was pumped to get this cd. it is a great demonstration of Em's skills on the mic, still retaining his title as a controversial rapper. this is a strong album with great beats and lyrics on it. it is a little different from \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" because it goes a little deeper into his life, with songs like \\"Hailie's Song,\\" a tribute to his daughter, and \\"Cleaning Out My Closet,\\" a song about the everlasting conflicts with his mother.  however, Em can still rock the mic in songs such as \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Business\\" with Dr.Dre.  With Eminem still going strong with his third LP, he could easily become the king of rap in the future...

0790736039|4.0|While not as frightening, suspenseful or excellent as the book; 'Stephen King's It' has done a good job in presenting the story on film. The cast is good, especially Pennywise and the children stars, and the script was well written. Although an excellent film on its own, compared to the book, it doesn't go into half as much detail and doesn't have the same scary or catastrophic quality.  Even saying this, I do not beleive that anyone could have presented the story in the same way as Stephen King and this is one of the most enjoyable adaptions I have seen of one of his books in many years.

1565847032|4.0|This is a rather unconventional book that compiles Noam Chomsky's opinions on just about everything, using transcripts from public discussions he gave over many years in many different places. Thus the book is kind of a hodgepodge that jumps around from topic to topic in a stream-of-consciousness kind of way, despite the editors' attempts to group the topics into chapters. All of Chomsky's opinions on the structure of power in the worlds of economics and politics are in fact responses to questions from anonymous seminar participants, identified here as \\"Man\\" or \\"Woman.\\" Unfortunately I suspect that many of these questions were planted to facilitate speechifying from Chomsky on selected topics. Meanwhile, it is hard to believe that all of Chomsky's comments in this book are merely recorded from live discussions that he gave - the sheer density and complexity of what he's saying suggest a lot of fleshing out by the editors. So approach this book's structure with skepticism.<br />As for Chomsky's opinions themselves, his knowledge of the working of corporate capitalism and economic forces, as related to a huge variety of specific topics, is simply mind-boggling. This is truly a learned man. His insights into the true workings of the capitalist economy for regular people (that is, 99.9% of the population) are extremely enlightening. However, on the political side, Chomsky is dangerously close to paranoid conspiracy theorist territory. He describes himself as either a democratic socialist, or more frequently as an anarchist. His anarchic vision is not of free-for-all chaos however, but a form of government in which there are no politicians and power is really shared by all people equally. He can admit the logistical difficulties of such a utopia, but this anarchist vision results in Chomsky disagreeing with ALL political philosophies. At various points in this book he says that the New Deal was a fascist endeavor, communists and fascists are exactly the same, and that big business is fascist in economics and communist in politics. Basically, both of those extremes are equally far away from Chomsky's desired anarchy. Unfortunately, Chomsky's political diatribes, while certainly compelling and revealing, make him come across as an anti-everything know-it-all. That makes parts of this book extremely tiresome and repetitive.g business is fascist in economics and communist in politics.

B000065U1N|4.0|If you've read the book and viewed interviews with the real soldiers involved in this Somalia incident, you'll know that the movie, well very well made, is disappointingly incomplete. There's not enough of a lead-in to let the viewer know the \\"Why\\" of the mission. Furthermore, I feel more follow-up of what happened politically as a result would have completed the movie more fully. Also, a \\"where are they now\\" regarding the soldiers involved would have been interesting and well-received.  As it is, I felt the movie's ending was too abrupt.<br />Barring those true-life issues, the special effects were spectacularly realistic, and the events depicted were quite accurate, (if incomplete) according to some Army buddies of our's who were actually over there at the time.<br />Definately worth purchasing!
B00005QIPH|5.0|the strokes are the best new band out there. the only one who comes close are the walkmen, but that's a whole other ballgame and no one really knows about them. when i first heard this is it, i liked it alot. then i got sick of it and thought it was the most boring thing i'd ever heard. now i love it again. it has worn well on me. so, the point is, if you get sick of it, give it another chance. it's really good, really fun, and as annoying as the drummer and guitar player are, they'rea t least bland enough that the singer's greatness comes through. why the guitar solos though - please spare us.

Great beats, especially \\"Sing for the moment.\\"  Using Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" beat.  Dre has out done himself.  Eminem tells the story of his life and all the problems he's gone through.  Is honest and includes his daughter on the album.  \\"When the music stops\\" is awesome.  Steely Dan can't beat this album.  The popular \\"Without Me\\" is only the fourth or fifth best song on the album.  You can't top the combo of Dre and Eminem.  This one has Grammy written all over it.  Eminem is the man :).

B00003CXI1|3.0|I saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone before I read the book. (I'm quite leery of books that get made into movies as they tend to loose the story somewhere in exchange for special effects; ala Star Wars Ep 1&2, but that's a whole other rant.)<br />Anyways, I fell in love with the story as I saw it unfold on screen. At that point I was itching to go read the book. To my delight I found that there were 4 books. I have not read so much in such a small amount of time.<br />After reading the first book, I decided that was shown in the movie, with the restrictions that movie makers have, that it told the story as best as it could without compromising any of the important story elements.<br />When the DVD went into development, I heard that deleted scenes would be added on a second disk and a whole bunch of other interesting tid bits. ...<br />So the mail comes, I'm eating my cake, my 4 year old niece is with me and her Mom when I pop in the 2nd DVD with the deleted scenes. I had read that there were a bunch of hoops (like playing a game) that one had to do to get to these much wanted scenes, but I'm pretty savvy with technology that I figured I could figure it out.<br />Much to my chagrin the people who made this DVD need to go back to marketing school and think about the fact that the 4 year old was BORED to tears with the way the 2nd disk was set up.<br />I finally found the instructions on how to access the 7 deleted scenes ...<br />The main gripes I have with the DVD are these:<br />1. Wide screen and anamorphic format should have been options (removed the label on one side of the DVD and this is possible.)<br />2. Make all extras easily accessible INCLUDING DELETED SCENES. Jumping through hoops is not only frustrating to adults, but especially to children.<br />3.Include more deleted footage instead of all the \\"games\\". If I wanted to play a games the online or pay for versions are options that I can go buy.<br />4. As with The Matrix, Moulin Rouge!, or The X-Men DVD include a version of the film that allows you to follow a white rabbit or green fairy (perhaps an owl?) where it then takes you to a deleted scene as it would fall in the order of the film or some behind the scene related *to* the scene option.<br />I was so hopeful that the DVD would have more, just as the book had \\"more\\" for me when I was finished watching the movie. 7 deleted scenes was not enough IMO.<br />However, in defense of those scenes, I will say that the extended potions class scene gives a greater depth to the Snape/Potter dynamic. Also, seeing the scene where Harry is thinking about his parents after discovering the mirror almost brought me to tears.<br />In closing, I loved the story, the movie was great, but as DVD,  kinda bites.

0684833395|5.0|this is one hilarious story with some of the most memorable lines i have ever read in a book! great read!
B00005JKCF|4.0|*Warning: Spoilers Abound*<br />After sitting through this movie, mixed feelings kept flooding in me.  Needless to say, at 12:20 a.m. I decided to call it a night and crash out.  I drove home, crawled into my bed (not in a Spider-Man fashion, mind you), and I wondered, I pondered, and I wondered some more.  Was I fully content with the movie?  Was it as maddeningly irksome as Episode II?  But ultimately, what did the comic-to-film adaptation of Spider-Man warrant score-wise?  Unquestionably, it left an impact on me, confirming me to get off my kister, get all fired up, and subsequently ripen a review.  The initial rating would have maybe landed on a 2 or 3-Star rating at best, but as slumber began taking its toll on my eyes, I heard the exceptional musical score reemerge into my eardrums, I remembered those number of ridiculously amusing scenes instigating an outburst of guffaws throughout the audience, and when I began to visualize the incredibly nimble Spider-Man slinging throughout the golden Manhattan, my first impulse dramatically altered.  Despite its enjoyable instances, the flaws began to supplant the finest moments.  The Green Goblin's costume comes across an unworldly and outlandishly getup that'll probably never see a light in the distant future.  I'm not a big fan of Spider-Man comics, but for the sake of comic book quibbles I have to admit that Gwen Stacy should have been implemented in the film, because after all she was Parker's first love.  Was she not?  Moreover, Kristen Dunst just doesn't cut it, she doesn't portray the highly sophisticated Mary Jane Watson.  Although the scene where Parker is figuring out how to work his web-shooting was hilarious, why did Stan Lee and his gang give a thumbs up to revise the original method of Spider-Man using web cartridges?  I'm not too big of a fan of comics but when stories begin to get modified for the \\"rules of Hollywood,\\" I get infuriated.  However, in spite of  the cases that I categorize as flaws, they are all MINOR.  Most importantly, Spider-Man retains the tone of the pages where he originated.  The movie is not supposed to be dark and isn't.  It takes itself seriously when the situation calls for it, thus it closely correlates with the comics.  The day after Peter Parker was bitten by the genetically enhanced spider (by the way, it actually doesn't skitter away in the Spidey pages, it fell lifelessly to the ground after it sunk its incisors on Parker), was a excellent scene as Parker invests time to master his powers and simultaneously worsens his relationship with his Uncle Ben.  The wrestling match was just as brilliant, as Macho Man was ill-equipped for the totality of Spider-Man's fleetness and his chain of gut-wrenching kicks.  Full of sarcastic humor, \\"your friendly neighborhood Spider-man,\\" digs up all the glory for accomplishing an extraordinary adaptation on the big screen.  The movie stirred up excitement, engrossment, and overall kept me satisfied for spending serious dough on costly tickets.  Even though I thought a 3-Star rating would do the justice, my comic book fancy and sensibilities were bursting in elation, and I was finally decisive to give the wall-crawler the whole package.  That's right.  Forget that 4-Star rating at the top, this movie merits all of them!  It's not easy to pull of such a feat in which Spider-Man has pulled off, Marvel rips up the competition and I'm roaring in delight!  I was repulsed by the corny X-Men, I loathed all the Batman movies when Keaton retired as the Dark Knight, and lastly I absolutely detested the Superman Saga, but for the first time, I have fallen for a comic-book-flick that nearly meets all my expectations.  As for the sequel, I pray that it won`t revolve around the Legacy of the Green Goblin, but of Spider-Man's more sinister villains such as Venom, but for that to happen is next to impossible because of all the background story and not to mention a trip to the cosmos.  Maybe the return of the Goblin won't be so bad after all, but as history repeat itself, sequels frequently drop below the achievement repute of its predecessor, yet only time and the fortitude of those behind the future design of Spider-Man 2 will tell.  Let's all  hope it reaches Terminator 2 status, and not moldy Episode II baloney.t be so bad after all, but as history repeat itself, sequels frequently drop below the achievement repute of its predecessor, yet only time and the fortitude of those behind the future design of Spider-Man 2 will tell.

B00003CXI1|2.0|This DVD is a huge disappointment.  The movie is wonderful, but the \\"special features\\" that they lean so heavily on as a selling point don't even exist for all viewers.  You can't watch the special features unless you jump through a bunch of contrived hoops, ....  On top of this, the contrived hoops don't function, and lock up both my DVD player and the DVD drive on my computer.  If they wanted to slip something unadvertised in for those people willing to play their silly games, that would be one thing.  It seems dishonest, though, to lean on a special features as a selling point and not put them in a format that can be accessed by everyone.  I could have bought the VHS format and not lost anything.

B00005T7I1|5.0|Kudos to Walt Disney Home Video for releasing this old favorite in widescreen.   Disney releases are all too often compromised versions of the originals when they are not released in their original theatrical ratios.  For all those reviewers who complain  about the lack of supplemental material on this disc remember:  all the &quot;extras&quot; in the world cannot make up for pan and scan versions of well made films like this.
0679720200|1.0|why are we forced to read this GARBAGE in high school? this book was terrible. i really felt like jumping in the book and slappin' that guy around a bit. how could he just act like that? UGH!
B00005RRG9|5.0|...For any Parent Trap fan, you need to get the DVD version.  I was blown away by all the bonus footage in this version, most already mentioned by previous reviewers.  There must be at least an additional 2-3 hours worth of extras.  The version with Hayley and David Swift narrating is amazing, and is so interesting to listen to their commentaries. I was so happy to see so many of the cast interviewed, Hayley, Sharon (forgot her last name: who played the double in some of the scenes) Maureen O'Hara, Joanna Barnes, and even the Sherman Bros, whom I was so glad to finally see after all these (40) years!  Even the commercials and a slide show that you can scroll through.  Plus lots of scenes with Walt himself on the set. And biographies of the stars to boot with home movies!  I still haven't seen it all, and I have watched about 2 hours worth besides the movie.  I also have seen this movie about 30 times and never tire of it.  One of my favorite scenes is when Leo G. Carroll discovers that Brian Keith has another wife (errr X-Wife)!  He is just too cute for words!  But the whole movie is wonderful, and Hayley is the best!<BR>Buy the DVD, you will not regret it.
B00006690F|5.0|This album is one of Em best cd's out of his first two albums. Any Em fans should get this album and for new Em fans out there too. All of the tracks are funny and entertaining. You have to have a sense of humor for Em's music. Em shares again with us his point of views with his personal life, current issues in America,etc. You will enjoy the samples but it is better to just buy the album. Just when you think he has nothing else to talk about, he hits us with some very unique style. He proves that he is a growing artist always reinventing himself and keeping it real. The bonus DVD includes a preview of his new Em's Europe Tour DVD, first video, slim shady cartoon, movie tralier from his new movie and other live perfomances too.
630289915X|5.0|This film has been used and even overused as the model to many others. A  man is framed by the local capitalist in Bedford Falls who wants to put his hands on the business this man manages to the sole benefit of his clients. His whole life was a fight against injustice, against greed, against inhuman capitalists who consider other men as mere toys on their chessboard. He is led to the envy to commit suicide. But God sends an angel to save him. The method is simple : grant his wish, temporarily, not to have been born. And we have a trip in this society the way it would be if the greedy capitalist, Mr Potter, had not had our hero as a fighting counterpart. The vision of this would-be world is drastic and absolutely dramatic. The worse sides of every man have found the proper environment to prosper and build an unethical world especially by expelling all those who had a moral sense. He then has the possibility to go back to his real life and he discovers that he can escape bankrupcy and all it means for his clients thanks to his friends, nearly the whole population of Bedford Falls who give him the little money thay can find for him to go through this difficult situation and prevent Mr Potter from putting his claws on the city. Capitalism is a fighting tool for those who want to unite against greed and to join forces and will to promote a better world. This trick of seeing what the world would be if the greedy had the upper hand was used in many other films, for one the Back to the Future trilogy. This film is also a tremendous boost for those who doubt the outcome of their fight against immoral powerful people : fight and fight again and never forget that « no man is a failure who has friends ». It is true it is hard at times to see it, but yet any rockbottom despair is not worth dying since it would give an easy victory to the immoral band of people who take advantage of capitalism to impose their will and greed over the whole world.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0780620003|5.0|I am a big fan of SPAWN the comic book and was thrilled at the live-action movie. The visual effects and make-up are unlike anything you've ever seen before! The R-Rate version is a little different from the theatrical release. Mostly, it's some dialogue from the clown (brilliantly played by Lequizamo)That's right. You might not recognize him, but it's true. As Todd has said, the extra footage was to enhance the enjoyment level. Plus, the R Rated Director's Cut comes with a behind-the-scenes featurette and an interview with Todd McFarlane. This flick is a real treat.
B00005RRG9|5.0|The Walt Disney favorite &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; as you've never seen it before!  The widescreen presentation and the THX restored picture and sound enhance the viewing of this family classic.  The supplemental disc is loaded with interesting extras, including original music tracks, vintage clips with Walt from his television show, and too many others to list here.  The Disney Company has found a way to showcase its live-action films in this &quot;Vault Disney&quot; series in a way usually reserved for its animated features.  Thank you to everyone involved in this release -- let's hope that ALL future Disney releases will be presented in their original theatrical ratios.
0553208845|5.0|I'm rather surprised that there are no reviews for this book, which is a masterpiece of literature. I had to read this for my AP english class in high school about ten years ago, and i still remember the many great parts to this book. this book describes the life of the great Siddhartha and how he achieved enlightenment, becoming the great Buddha. there are beautiful imagery, my favorite being about the river and how it flows, and how life is like that river (sorry i dont remember the details of it, after all, i did read this ten years ago.)
B000065U1N|1.0|This movie is about going into a country that has nothing to do with us and killing lots of people in the process.<br />Every single person that saw this movie said that it reaked of racism and hatred...This movie was released to try to weigh people's opinion about the us going into Somalia and killing somemore innocent people.<br />Well guess what...It didn't work and many people saw it for what it was.<br />Let's not forget that we bombed the only medicine factory in Somalia and now lots of people are dying because of it.<br />Save your money and get something that's not full of hatred and racism against non-white people!!!
0780622553|5.0|This movie is a work of cinematic and creative genius. It may borrow a lot of elements from many many other movies, but it blends them PERFECTLY.<br />The movie is very consistent in even its most minscule features. How the Strangers do everything in circles (reminds me of the Ramans and their \\"3\\" rules), then when you look at the actual shape of the city itself, it's a perfect spiral (the rat maze in Dr. Shrieber's office is actually a \\"map\\" of the city. Compare it to the Strangers' city map for their next experiment - perfect match. I like little details like this in movies. To me it shows that the makers know exactly what they're doing and that they aren't just plowing through it.<br />Another aspect I HAVE to express my opinion of is the use of lighting - the lighting is brilliant! It captures the dark, gloomy essence of the movie's atmosphere, and also gives just enough to be able to see the actors' faces.<br />The characters are very well portrayed (especially Richard O'Brian. Not only did he play Mr. Hand, he also wrote the Rocky Horror Show)<br />I actually ended up wanting to live there for a while... I'm not too fond of sunlight myself, and that city has NO sunlight.<br />All the way through, the film has a genuinely creepy feel to it. There's also a sense of chaos that becomes more and more apparent as you see things being changed, how all physics become screwed over, and how night lasts forever. And nobody has any idea what's going on (except the main character)

B000065U1N|2.0|Of course we are all used to the fact that hollywood takes it liberties with the truth. However, this film is so much a rewriting of history it made me sick. I would have left the theatre had I not been stuck in the middle of a row. The film portrays the american troops as doing all they can to try and save the day, when in reality it was the american decision to hunt Aideed that signalled the end of earlier effective humanitarian intervention. The americans did not save the day, they created the mess. added to this the ill judget attempt at humour during the film (the lost soldiers, har har har) the story is [poor]. Sound, editing and special effects are brilliant though, and if that is what you go for, plus a lot of violence and blood (way over the top) this is for you.
0525946284|5.0|This book is twisted, compelling, and absolutely enjoyable.  Follett is wonderfully adept at building tension, weaving a  gripping story, and bringing the reader to a crescendo that leaves us gasping.  The characters in JACKDAWS bring humor and passion to an overwhelmingly frightening period in history.  The female lead is clearly one of the best Follett has ever created - courageous, cunning, and feminine.  Even the excruciatingly persistent Nazi antagonist is marvelously multi-dimensional, giving the story a depth that makes us think beyond good versus evil.  The story loses no momentum at the end and leaves the reader with a mix of emotion that lingers long after finishing.
6304712944|2.0|Having grown up listening to the Broadway album recording of \\"Camelot,\\" my hopes were dashed upon recently viewing this DVD. Having never realized that there were two soundtrack albums for Camelot, it never occured to me that I wouldn't be hearing the stirring singing of the Broadway album, including the villainous songs of Mordred, which were easily my favorite pieces in the whole work.<br />In addition to not hearing \\"The Seven Deadly Virtues\\" and \\"Fie on Goodness\\" -- two of the greatest villain songs of all time, without question -- the musical and acting performances overall here are subpar at best. Richard Harris seems to be trying to do his whole performance via his eyebrows, which wiggle about on his forehead like catepillars trying to escape his face. Vanessa Redgrave, for all her justly deserved reputation as an actress, looks more underfed than radiant as Guenevere and Franco Nearo seems to be having a lot of fun in an entirely different film.<br />Director Joshua Logan did the real damage to this story, though, with a disjointed directing style that focusses more on interesting scenes and bits than making a coherent tale. Time passes at varying rates, with never any warning to that effect, and while some of the issues with the script are leftovers from the play, there's no excuse for not making a more coherent film, cutting and adding to the book as needed.<br />On the whole, this is a highly disappointing movie, and the DVD has a slapped together feel, with pale text in a squiggly font placed atop bright backgrounds, making much of the additional content -- which is anemic compared to disks like \\"Shrek\\" -- unreadable and unusable.<br />This is a renter, and even then, only if you've exhausted every other choice at your local video rental shop.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is wonderful. I have to admit that the first time i saw it in theaters I was a bit dissapointed in the film for lack of drive, but then i saw it a second time and it captivated me. I'm not saying it didn't captivate me the first time I saw it, my face had a permenant smile on it the whole time.... I'm just saying.     <BR>     I recently rented the DVD and it is wonderful. To get to the extra scenes is a bit annoying but if you just remember to get your wand and then click on the collum in the classroom place you'll be fine. :)<BR>    If you saw this movie in the theaters and you weren't to thrild with it, I ask you to please try it again. It really keeps on getting better and better each time, and the kids make the movie.<BR>      Daneil Radcliffe as Harry is perfect. He embodies everthing Harry is and how he looks in my mind (and many others at that),on his preformance i give you a quote from Ron(Harry's friend)...\\" That was bloody brilliant!\\" Ron in the film is played by Rupert Grint, who is adorable as well as a source of hummor. And we must not forget that little clever witch Hermione, who is played perfectly by Emma Watson. <BR>    Also if you are a fan of any of the following actors this film is worth a shot: Dame Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Richard Griffiths, Alan Rickman, Ian Hart, or Robbie Coletrain. All do a wonderful job and Robbie as Hagrid adds a hole lot of hummor to the film with his abbsent mindedness and odd tastes for pets. :)<BR>   I look forward to the other films and hope that they keep the amazing cast that they have now, especially the kids!<br />Bottom line: Great film, Great fun, After you watch it, read the book(s), you'll love it even more. :)<br />p.s. If you have the vhs version, at the end of the film, there are only two extra scenes, as apposed to the seven on the DVD. Just a fact I'd thought I would throw out there for you all.  :)

6304493681|3.0|Back when anime was a struggling medium in the United States, there are said to be two movies that really started to open the minds and ears of stubborn US citizens who thought animation was just for children. The first is &quot;Akira&quot;, and the second is &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Both were based off of now legendary manga series; in the case of &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, it was based off the fantastic manga by Masamune Shirow. But the manga was so complex that they had to omit a lot from the manga and change quite a bit in order to make an anime movie out of the manga. The result has become a cult classic in the anime circles, but sadly that is all the movie is and will ever be.<br />The movie deals with Major Kotome Kusanagi, who lives in a futuristic world where cyber criminals are everywhere. One of the biggest crimes concerns ghost-hacking, which is the crime of tampering with someone's spirit, essentially. As the story progresses, Kusanagi must find a mysterious hacker known as the Puppet Master, and from there things take a very bizarre twist.<br />One of the biggest flaws of the movie is that it tries to condense a fair amount of the manga into the movie. For the most part it succeeds, but occasionally it gets so confusing that a second-viewing might be necessary. Another flaw is that a lot of the movie is talk. It might be argued that talking isn't bad because it makes sure the movie isn't a mindless action movie; but when there is too much talking, watching the movie can be the same as listening to books on tape. Luckily, this problem isn't present everywhere, but it can get quite bad when it is present.<br />Not necessarily a flaw but a personal annoyance is the amount of nudity in the film and how much of it isn't necessary. There was nudity in the manga, but not this much. One scene in particular is when Kusanagi, for absolutely no reason, strips her clothes to fight a large robotic tank. But it can hardly be called fan service because ofthe serious tone of the anime, and the nudity is more tasteful than tasteless.<br />Visually, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is a marvel to look at. The tone of the movie is dead serious, and the animation has that same tone. There are no chibi-like moments here: no sweat drops, no incredibly large eyes, just realistic character models and interactions. The environments are breathtakingly detailed, and the character models are marvelous.<br />Soundwise, the dub is one of the better dubs on the market today. Dialogue never sounds flat or static, and the voice-actors sound like they are actually enjoying themselves. Don't go in expecting something like the horrible dubs for &quot;Ronin Warriors&quot; or &quot;Pilot Candidate&quot;; &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; makes the anime readily available for its English-speaking audience, however limited it is.<br />All in all, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is a true anime classic but will never grow to be more than a cult classic. Some people will be turned off by the complex story; others will cringe in disgust at the choral music of the opening credits that is an aquired taste. So while the anime is a work of art, there's little chance of it being accepted in the US mainstream.

0451457994|5.0|I have seen the Stanley Kubrick film of the same title hundreds of times before I decided to read the book. As the opening credits in the film state, &quot;Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke&quot;. Because the movie and the book were written simultaneously, I never thought the book would be much different. Once I began reading, however, I was stunned at how wrong I was, where in fact there was more than I dreamed of. What the movie could not convey, or maybe even did not want to convey was exposed in the writing. Clarke writes with clarity and passion; not just for writing, but also science as a means of expressing ones own existence. That existence being the ultimate question of man's relationship with the universe and the environment he has created for himself. The book is existential as well as mystical: scientific as well as theological: revaltory as well as inquisitive. The story follows the same track as the movie, yet with inner dialogue of the apes on Earth and their first meeting with the Black Monolith, describing how the impact of this clean, smooth, black mystery impacted their means of survival through the use of weaponry and tools. Following some 2001 years later into deep space towards Jupiter we meet H.A.L., another enigma that similarly impacts man and his ability to control his fate or destiny. For anyone who has seen the movie, the book will not surprise you as far as the generic structure of the story, yet Clarke's handling of the subject completely unknown at the time is simply startling.<br />Published in 1968 (a year before landing on the moon), Clarke dedicates this book to Stanley Kubrick. Likewise, Kubrick made a similar gesture with his film. This new edition includes some thoughts on the year 2001, as well as a small write-up on his relationship with Stanley. Highly reccomended.

0345448898|4.0|I don't consider myslef a fan of fantasy. Understandaby, I was very skeptical about this trilogy at first; 'Dust' being the key to all truth? Daemons? But to my surprise, I picked up \\"The Golden Compass\\" and finished it within a few hours,  and promptly did the same with the subsequent two books. The Fantasy is first rate, the characters are well-developed and the read is fun and fast. It's very enjoyable save a few problems. <br />1. It takes awhile to get into the series. This isn't always a bad thing: take Lord of the Rings, for instance. However, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is not only an amazing fantastical epic, but do well as individual stand-alone novels. the \\"His Dark Materials\\" Trilogy works quite well- as an epic trilogy, but the second novel follows the first so closely, that I got the impression that the subsequent two books would be very difficult to understand as stand-alone novels. <br />2. The author pulls you into his world immediately. Some authors do an incredible job with this (Tolkien, for example). But in this case, it's just confusing. He doesn't explain the little nuances of his universe until much later in the novel; I found myself wanting to go back and reread the first book just for clarification's sake. <br />3. It's not entirely clear who the bad/good guys are. This is not really a complaint; actually I quite enjoyed this aspect of the books. But for someone who is looking for an easy, uncomplicated read, this trilogy requires way too much concentration. <br />So...if you're looking for something to read that you don't have to think about, do not pick up this series. But if youre looking for a series with a highly detailed Universe (s), and one that goes into great depth and requires a much higher level of concentration than most pleasure novels, this is a great trilogy to read.
0385505833|3.0|For the first time since he published his first book 13 years ago author John Grisham has released two books in the same year and neither have anything to do with Law, the subject that he frequently writes about. This novel is very short as it has about 200 pages or less is a pleasant little diversion that doesn't require any ounce of thought. Luther and Nora Krank usually through the biggest party of the year at Christmas time, but this year things are different. Their daughter Blair has decided to become a missionary worker in a foreign country and won't be coming home for the holidays. Luther decides this year that he and his wife shall go on a cruise for the first time in their lives. Things get complicated when a series of unexpected events threaten to derail their holiday plans. Like most holiday movies you can tell what is going to happen long before you reach the end but it doesn't really matter. It's purely a fun story that Grisham had fun writing. Now he can get back to writing the REALLY good stuff.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|When I'm asked what my favorite album of all time is, my answer is often Making Movies.  I had heard &quot;Skateaway&quot; on the radio for years and loved it, but I didn't know any other songs on the album.  My lukewarm feelings for &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; kept me away from Dire Straits, but the day I finally bought this was a great one.  The first three tracks, &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and &quot;Skateaway,&quot; are flawless.  &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; allows Knopfler the time to build his intricate guitar work and showcases the piano skills of a borrowed member of the E Street Band.  &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is a love song...of sorts.  Knopfler's fingerstyle acoustic is impressive.  This version leaves the Indigo Girls' subsequent cover in the dust.<br />This is what made me a Dire Straits fan.  And if you like this one, check out their first album as well.

6305313687|3.0|Edward Norton, that whiny Yale grad is one hell of an actor his performance makes this movie watchable, but only a actor of his calibur could save this movie from being complete dreck.  Where should I start with the complaints, ah yes.  The liberal bias in Hollywood is present, and you want prove watch this.  It seems that you are either a liberal(the good guys) or a conservative homophoic racist fascist bigot.  There is no in-between, its just that easy.  The dinner table scene with Elliot Gould is the best example.  While Edward Norton is spewing his hate filled diatribes, the only opposition to his speech is a pretty left-wing point of view.  If a conservative was sitting at the table, I think he would be just as outraged at the language Norton uses, but no we can't add even a little bit of debate into this.  Its the liberal way or the fascist way.  Well, now that I'm done with that, I'll get to the plot.  Ultimately, its a little predictable and overwrought.  And the ending, I mean come on, what the hell is that supposed to be, I know we're going to make an ending that will make people think, why, what the hell.  Basically, its a copout and I think a happy ending would have worked better, just because the ending this film has is pretty much a ridiculous anti-climax, and that voiceover at the end needed to go, it just made me laugh.  But I'm done with this, Eddie makes it watchable but ultimately this film is pretty substandard.
0440234743|4.0|The Testament is Grisham's first foray into Indiana Jones territory with this gripping novel that expertly mixes adventure and legal suspense all in one fine book. Troy Phelan is an extremely wealthy man. (Number 10 on Forbes most wealthy list) After various marriages affairs and kids Troy decides to end his life, but not before he makes one last business transaction, a slick manoeuvre that sends shockwaves into the lives of his various relatives who are anxiously awaiting their share of the money. Enter his attorney Josh Stafford who performs the unspeakable act, which gives the bulk of his estate to an illegitimate child that no one except Troy knows about. The catch is that she is a missionary worker in the jungles of Brazil and the only man who could go their and come back alive is a disgraced alcoholic lawyer named Nate O'Reilly who is emerging from his fourth stay in re - hob. He was once a explorer and Nate is hand picked for the job because of his adventurous background. As Nate tries to locate her , the family back home tries to contest the will and do anything to get their fair share. The plot is well developed and so are the characters. An exciting read that should prove to be another blockbuster hit for John Grisham.

B00005BL2A|1.0|When dm fans think of the past they always got the feeling that this has to be it. the final dm album - the final dm sound - that there's no way the band can top it the next time. so it was with violator. but then there came songs of faith and devotion. then everybody thought thats it and yet there came ultra. and again anyone thought thats the ultimate dm album. and guess what? finally patience paid of and we were right. <BR>exciter - i don't really get it what this title relates to. certaintly not to the sound of this cd. if it wouldn't be for dream on this one star rating would still be way too much. so if you like this song and think about bying the cd. forget about it. go for the single and thats it. the remaining 12 tracks might as well put you into sleep. but then again they are so shockingly week that one always finds himself pressing the next button on the remote control after a couple of seconds in hope the next track will be better. but in the end one runs out of tracks. bottom line: exciter sounds uninspired and hence leaves listeners uninspired the whole way.
B00003CXI1|3.0|The movie is good, widescreen is always nice, the bitrate is high, and enough other reviews have been written for content. But the DVD presentation drags the whole rating down. There appears to be a layer transition problem around 28:42. There is no director's commentary. The menu loads are overly long. Most of the extras really aren't that great. And, what is probably the best part of the extras, the deleted scenes, aren't even easily accessible without wasting twenty-five minutes of your life playing mini-games. Get the movie, but don't expect a good DVD design.
B000003S5H|4.0|This is the pinnacle of sit back and relax albums.  It doesn't put you in a trance, it just makes you feel serene, but also lazy, my motivation seems to disappear when I listen to this.   Air are extremely gifted at crafting a beautiful melody.  I personally am tired with all the emphasis on rhythm in electronic music.  This album is filled to the brim with them, the first and best song on the album starts with a cliche water sound, then all these melodies just come and go, little hand claps show themselves, and its 7 minutes long and it could be double that and it wouldn't be boring.  So, as most know, the stoners have united and proclaimed their chill-out music to be this album, you can join them if you wish.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Ah yes Blink-182's now infamous \\"Enema Of The State\\", loved by many, and hated by countless numbers of angry punk fans. Being a big Blink-182 fan myself, I enjoyed this album from the day of it's release. While many newer fans were introduced to the band via this release, many older fans left writing this off as Blink's \\"sellout\\" album. True, I wasn't exactly thrilled when I saw the band on TRL (ugh...), but I couldn't deny the quality of the songs on \\"Enema\\" so I stuck with it.<br />Prior to this album Blink-182 had a very rough around the edge's pop-punk sound. Both \\"Cheshire Cat\\" and \\"Dude Ranch\\" are fast paced, humorous, and incredibly well done. But, with the release of \\"Enema\\" Blink introduced a slower and more structured sound, which has been their signature sound to this day. Change for a band is a big step, sometimes the sound slips and falls on the way, this is the contrary for Blink-182 who made sure their fans knew just who they were listening to.<br />I often refer to \\"Enema...\\" as the big change for the band, not just for their sound, but for the members as well. With newcomer Travis Barker replacing Scott Raynor on drums something just seemed to click, and everything fell perfectly in place. And believe it or not, Blink had done a great deal of maturing from their previous two albums, both musically and lyrically (i.e. \\"Adams Song\\").  If you didn't enjoy this just because everyone else did, don't be stubborn, your missing out on alot.
B00006690F|5.0|When I first got this album, I wasn't sure what to expect. The only song I had heard before this was \\"Without Me,\\" which wasn't a bad song. I put this into my cd player. <BR>The one song I must say that stands out amongst the rest is \\"Sing for the Moment.\\" It is a remake of the classic Aerosmith cut \\"Dream On.\\" I wasn't sure if it would be a great remake or a bomb. When I heard this song, I was so impressed. He had succeeded and it is now my favorite song on the album.<BR>Eminem executive produced this album, so there were even some rock beats, which, in my opinion, strenghened the album. This time around the beats fit in nicely with the lyrics.<BR>Other songs that I found catchy were \\"White America\\" and \\"Hailies Song,\\" which he actually takes a stab at singing. He has a nice singing voice, which made for a nice track. <BR>Overall, I really like the album, and is almost as good, if not as good then the Slim Shady LP.  It also came with a bonus dvd and the lyrics are in the album booklet, which is always nice.
1590710037|5.0|I just recieved this book today and started reading.  Easy to read and somewhat poetic.  Some of the points the auther makes hit me between the eyes!  Similiar I think to Robert Fritz's Book &quot;The Path of Least resistance but from a different point of view that I found helpful.<br />I literally could feel my &quot;unsullied, uncorrupted, soundproof, waterproof, and bulletproof&quot; creative &quot;part' as I read..good to know it is still there....<br />Missing (thank God) much of the self help lingo which I have come to dread.  I think the author did a fine job on his first &quot;self help&quot; experiment!
B00000DCH9|4.0|In my mind, it was the singers like James Taylor, Neil Diamond, and Billy Joel who shaped the music of the '70's and powerfully influenced pop music of the following generations.  I might get argument in my feeling that there is noticeable influence by both of the other singer/writers in Billy Joel's output, and that's no putdown because he still has his individual style, even if flavors of the other two are there.  <br />&quot;Travelin' Prayer&quot; is indeed a strong opening song, one that expresses love for the woman while portraying a feeling that there is a being listening, though he doesn't really know how to talk to that being.  &quot;Piano Man&quot; is of course the signature hit.  But &quot;You're My Home&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot; are definitely significant, and &quot;Stop In Nevada&quot; deserves recognition.  And the conclusion, &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, is up there with the best of the '70's.  <br />If you're at all into the influential music that started in the 70's, you need at least one Billy Joel CD, and there is much more depth in this one then you'll find in a collection that just has his major hits.
B000062TU1|5.0|With a $90.3 Million opening weekend, plus a 300 and some million-dollar total at the box office in the end, the most famous wizard will no doubt be popular with his new DVD!  Directed by Chris Columbus and starring Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes DVD a magical experience.  It is a 2 disc DVD set.  The movie is wonderful and rated PG for scary moments and some course language.  This film has it all, action, mystery, fantasy, and suspense!  The DVD package even has \\"Year one\\" on its side, just like the books!<br />DVD number 1 includes the complete movie with Scene access, English and Spanish subtitles, plus the teaser and theatrical trailers!  The opening intro to the DVD menu is spectacular with scenes from the movie and the popular Hedwig's Theme music!  Disc 1's menu has 4 options to choose from: Play Movie, Special Features, Scene Selection, and Language!  The background of the menu is the beautiful enchanting Hogwarts Castle!<br />DVD number 2 has just special features.  The menu opens up to a small intro and you see Hogwarts school get closer and it zooms in, then you're in the Great Hall, and finally the you're at the Teacher's table (The menu).  You can choose from options like a 360 degree tour of Hogwarts (You tour the Great Hall and the Gryffindor common room).  Other options include: <BR>*Diagon Alley-Visit Gringotts, Eeylops owl Emporium, or Ollivanders.<BR>*Classrooms-go to class to mix potions, and cast spells.<BR>*Interviews-Watch interviews with the director and producer themselves, plus get info on the next Harry Potter movie.<BR>*Plus you can tour Hagrid's hut at Hogwarts grounds, check out the Library, and even see the extra credit, but you need a PC DVD-Rom drive to access the extra credit features.<br />Then there is the highly anticipated 7 deleted, never-before-seen clips.  Only problem is that they are hidden in disc 2.  To get them you have to got through the Forbidden Corridor, sneak past Fluffy, get the correct winged key and potion, and you'll end up at the Mirror of Erised to get the Sorcerer's Stone and your hearts desirer...The deleted scenes!  They are a reward.  The clips don't come out in the full movie, which many probably expected like I did.  The 7 scenes are: Dudley's uniform, Cracking eggs, Tube ride, After troll, Harry's meditation, Finding Flamel, and Snape's class.  The DVD is truly magical and is worth buying once you get used to it!
B000065U1N|5.0|Apocalypse now - helicopter attack (minus Wagner music) plus Saving private Ryan - first half hour equals Black Hawk Down.<BR>This movie, based on a true story, is war roller-coaster and one of the best.
B00004TH7Z|2.0|It's kind of sad to hear this album when you know they could have done much better.<br />The first thing I noticed...aside from the boring songs with the endlessly repeating choruses, is that the album just plain sounds bad. The vocals are buried...and what happened to Steve Harris' bass sound??? It's not there...almost sounds like a demo that was released without much thought. Everything on this album sounds thin and weak and all you have to do to realize that is put on Piece of Mind or Powerslave and compare....no comparison.<br />Please...someone get Martin Birch out of his rocking chair and put him back in to the studio again!!!!<br />But I have to admit...I listen to it....with the only other choices of new heavy metal being bands like Korn, Limp Biskit...you know what I mean. This does'nt seem quite as bad. But that's not saying much.......Even as bad as this album is, Iron Maiden is still my favorite band.<br />The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because Virtual XI and X Factor were so awful...not even desrcibable with words.<br />If there is one good thing to say...it's that this is the coolest album/CD cover since Somewhere in Time, but how many times can you look at a cover...???
B000005S0E|5.0|This has to be the most bizarre Cure record ever, and its being inexplicably out-of-print only adds to the weirdness. It doesn't belong with the dour, slow Cure of Faith or Seventeen Seconds (too much instrumental variety), nor does it fit in with the lush, expansive Cure of Disintegration or Head on the Door (nowhere near as atmospheric). We've seen Robert Smith depressed before, but The Top is where he gets psychotic. His voice paints a picture of someone completely out of control and blind as a bat, utterly out of their mind. It's broken in pieces, and his inimitable tortured wails are at their most tortured and inimitable. Then there are the freakouts. The first time \\"Give Me It\\" came on, right after the hypnotic groove of \\"Wailing Wall,\\" I practically had to jump and hide behind a chair. It is quite possibly Smith's most insanely frenetic song ever, placed and carried out somewhat like \\"Doubt\\" from Faith, except hitting a thousand times harder. And the lyrics carry Smith's most burningly bizarre imagery ever. Some songs are just surreal jumbles of these images. It rather borders on frightening.<br />No song on The Top sounds like any other. Thematic coherence? Nope, none of that. We start with a fevered rocker (\\"Shake Dog Shake\\"), switch gears completely for the lighter \\"Birdmad Girl\\" (great title on that one), then switch them again for the mesmerizingly hypnotic \\"Wailing Wall.\\" This last one contains Smith's most \\"normal\\" singing on the album, making the next song (\\"Give Me It\\") that much freakier. From there we once again make a _complete_ about-face for the beautiful, melancholy pop of \\"Dressing Up\\" and the sad/cute \\"Caterpillar.\\" What follows is the subdued weirdness of \\"Piggy in the Mirror,\\" then another complete change into the military marching band tune of \\"The Empty World\\" (\\"stiff as toys and tall as men\\" is one of Smith's best lines ever), then yet another switch and more freakiness with the utterly incoherent \\"Bananafishbones,\\" and finally an end with the pounding, despondent title track. The stylistic thrashing about makes for a difficult listen, but also actually serves to distinguish each song since every one of them stands out on its own. And the opaque, crazed lyrics add to the effect (\\"spurning sex like an animal of God\\"? whatever that is, it doesn't sound too happy, does it?).<br />It's hard to say which is the best track on the album, since they're all so different as to be incomparable. It's not an album to be played on every occasion, or even often, but for those times when you're feeling completely lost and confused, I daresay there's nothing better. Manic, paranoid and surreal, The Top is not an easy listen, but there's no other Cure album quite like it. The price is a bit steep, what with it being out of print in the States and all, but I declare it to be worth it. Purchase it today.
B00005RG6M|4.0|This disk sounds great in surround. Even the DTS is good. However, is it just my copy or is there a skip in Good Company on the DTS track near the end on the line &quot;take care of those you call your own&quot; (repeats &quot;your own&quot; and doesn't sound natural doing it). The disk doesn't have any scratches on it and I don't have a CD to compare the song to. I also just wanted to say that all features on the disk such as the video and the photo-gallery are accessible if you just have DVD-Video with DTS.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Despite the fact that his next film supposedly stars Adam Sandler, Anderson is also probably one of this best filmmakers in this generation, too.
B0000634EV|5.0|If you were expecting DOWN to remake the same cd from seven years ago, you may be dissapointed. The fact is times change, men change and the music they make changes. This is one great hard rock cd, no it isnt as relentless as NOLA (which I also thought was an unbelievable cd) it is much broader in scope, with different musical influences. I have listened to it more than 100 times already and it is still getting better. Don't over analyze things just put the disc in and crank it up, this cd will rock you.
B00006690F|5.0|I have both of Eminem's other CD's, and after one listen through, this is my favorite.  It's easily his most danceable (which may earn him more criticism) and there are even signs that he's grown.  The song Cleain Out My Closet is this album's message to his mother, and in it you find him still angry, but it's tinged with sorrow and, dare I say it, perhaps even vulnerability.<br />The song White America is my favorite (for now, it's only been 2 days).  The song poses the question of whether he would be so controversial, or indeed so successful if he were black. It's a challenge to parents everywhere to ask \\"Do we just not like his lyrics, or are we ticked that are kid are relating to his lyrics?\\".<br />But through it all, Eminem retains his bratty wit, mocking all the usual suspects, (he's got a real grip with Tipper Gore and the Cheyney family) and, though I sometimes question his logic, it's still a hoot.  If I have one gripe, it's that he pushes the whole \\"I'm a white rapper\\" thing a little too far.  But with talent like his, it's hard to blame him.
B00003CXI1|3.0|WARNING: the three is for the hassle of special features..not the movie itself<BR> If you liked the movie...Good.  I assume most of you know about it, and I am not going to give you details.  What I will say it that the extra features are time consuming and complicated.  The deleted scenes require you to find hidden &quot;eastereggs&quot;, such as clicking the key in Diagon Ally's Gingotts bank, buying a wand, going back to menu, through all sorts of hidden tasks to finally see the deleted scenes. And if you hit the wrong button...you have to start all over again.  AND you must do this every time you put the DVD in to see most of the extra features. Go to dvdeastereggs.com and they will give you more explict instructions on how to accomplish these tasks.  The very interactive DVD is well and good for children, but if you'e an adult, until you remember the sequeces and orders you must go through to see anything, expect to be frustrated.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Hands down and without question.
B00006690F|5.0|Listening to this cd made chills go up my spine. Every song on this cd has an amazingly orginal beat and sound to it. As usual the lyrics in alot of the songs are hard to forget and made me want to keep listening over and over again. Basically if you liked his  last two albums you wont be dissappointed by this one. Feature guests are Dr.Dre, nate dogg, obie trice, and a couple others. Another thing about the cd i liked is the varitey that it held. Every song was original and different than the last. I didnt have to even think when i rated this cd 5 stars. Its a must get for all rap lovers.
6303379214|4.0|This movie lost a star because, in truth, I found Marisa Tomei's character to be a bit over the top.  She believes in fate, and that a ouji game when she was eleven proffered the name of her future husband.  And so many years later, she ends up all the way in Rome to find the man with this name -- the man of her dreams. (By this time she's engaged, but the guy is schmuck, so it's really not important).<br />This is a hokey premise, even for me, and I always love the hokey romantic comedies.  After the first 20 minutes, I almost gave up.  But then the lovely Robert Downey Jr. graced the screen and reminded me why I watch reruns of Ally McBeal on F/X.  He's sweet, he's charming, he's fantastically charismatic.  He spends this movie doing his best to charm Marisa Tomei into falling in love with him, resorting to some not-so-honest tricks.  Normally this would be a little too stalkerish, but somehow, Robert just makes it work.<br />So if you like romantic comedies and their highly predictable endings, and especially if you dig Robert, you'll like this movie.  (Oh and it also has Bonnie Hunt -- from Jerry McGuire and Return to Me -- another good reason to check it out).
B00006690F|5.0|There is no doubt that this is his best cd yet.  Any true eminem fan will love this album. He deals with more serious issues through his lyrics that show his insight and perspective about the world. Also, this album has less silly and sometimes upsetting remarks.<br />Here are some of my favorites:<BR>2. White America- a deep song that has incredbile insight, which actually has some truth to it.<br />4. Cleaning out my closet- Another really great song that is on the soundtrack to Eminem's new movie \\"8 mile.\\"  It has a really good beat to it.<br />10. Without me- we all know this song<br />12.  I can't remember the name of this song but it has some more intrigueing observations about life.<br />14. Hailie's Song- a heartwarming, yet still Eminem-style, song tributed to his daughter.<br />I rate this album fivew stars and think that everyone should buy it.
B00000JKH2|5.0|Frantic yet full of blissful arrangement, At the Drive-In's Vaya is one of their most complete pieces of work, seemlessly written and another original piece by an original band. Released in mid-1999, this album can be considered one of the main reasons that ATDI began to catch fire and prompted the marriage of Ross Robinson and Grand Royale for Relationship of Command.<br />Overall, this release demonstrates the many facets of ATDI: slowed down, dramatic songs and energetic speedy anthems. Cedric's voice and lyrics are both flawless, adding the most interesting dynamic to the band's tight rhythm section. As a whole, the EP manages to encapsulate the best ATDI moments in the short twenty minutes: &quot;Racsuache&quot; with it's ambient feeling and pushing chords, &quot;Ursa Minor&quot;'s powerful chorus and breakdown, and the dramatic and flowing &quot;198d&quot;.<br />While most people have been introduced to ATDI due to the phenomenal success and critical ravings of Relationship of Command, even a casual listener would and can appreciate the music on this and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in dynamic music. The sound of ATDI is uniquely theirs and comes out in full force on this CD, making it essential for the fan and an interesting gift to the uninitiated.
B00006690F|5.0|Another Great album by Eminem a.k.a Slim Shady a.k.a Marshal Mathers. \\"Without Me\\" the best song of all the tracks.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I just got this in the mail yesterday, giddy with joy.  Watched disc one, and loved it.  Tried disc two and was stymied because I dont have a DVD CD Rom for my computer, I cant access alot of the special stuff because of that.  The movie however rocked!
B00003CXI0|5.0|I never read the books but I did venture to the movie theatre.<BR>I was entranced from the start of the film.  I want to go to the Hogwart(is that right?)school.  I want to have an owl as a familiar.  I want to know Harry Potter.  Never has a movie excited me into regression.  I was a young child seating on the edge of my seat loving this movie.  Do I believe in Magic? I sure do!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I first heard this album while perusing a  bookstore.  I was struck by it's simplicity and the overall feeling it gives.  A very chilled out, jazzy little piece of work--I enjoy it immensely.  Ms. Jones' vocals are very pretty, with just the right amount of breathy tone and melancholy.  <br />The arrangements on this album are all straight-forward and simple, but are played well; I especially enjoy Brian Blade's work. Part of the beauty of this album is it's simplicity, it's perfect for listening by yourself or with a group of people just relaxing.  <br />I give this album a four out of five stars because I do feel that some of the tracks begin to sound alike as the album progresses, but this detracts from the overall picture in only a small way.  Once again I say that I enjoyed this album very much and I'm looking forward to hearing more from this talented young lady in the future.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I am not a fan of repackaging of old material and making a &quot;new&quot; disc.  All these beatles songs are great, but I own all the albums already &amp; I ask you, do you think Paul, George, Ringo and Yoko need more $?  Only buy this if you dont own all the albums or you are heavy into comps.
B00006690G|4.0|Great return for Eminem. Not quite as angry as the MM LP, but a nice comeback. The opening track, \\"White America\\" has the angry lyrics bouncing over a great beat and killer riff. Perfect song to start the CD off with. \\"Soldier\\" is another great track with that trademark extra fast rap style Em has. I'd put this album at #2 of his 3 LP's, with Marshall Mathers #1, and Slim Shady @3.<BR>  It's great to have you back Em!
B00000J6AG|4.0|The best thing about this disc is the great &quot;rants&quot; (or essays-whatever) that Moby writes in the liner notes.  Being neither a Vegan nor a Christian I still enjoyed reading what he had to say; the man is coherent!<br />This was my 1st introduction to Moby.  (Actually that one song on the Gone in 60 sec. sndtk was...I digress).  I Think its a terrifically solid CD and a good intro into what Moby is all about.  If you think you might like Moby, also check out 18 and I like to Score.
B00005O3VC|5.0|There is no point in echoing 450 reviews, but there IS a point in mentioning that Columbia Tristar corrected the problems with Disk One mentioned in earlier reviews.   This was a problem whereby many DVD players (including most Sony and Toshiba players) kept spontaneously turning on the English subtitles.<br />Disk One was corrected, and now I can personally confirm that Amazon's stock consists of the corrected version, and so it is \\"safe\\" to purchase this superb DVD (one of my Top 10 films) right from this web page.<br />FYI, I should mention that there is still one flaw, which it seems will never be corrected, that the first \\"Swedish\\" subtitle is strangely missing, even though all the subsequent \\"Swedish\\" subtitles are there.  ...
B00004XQ83|5.0|I accidentially fell into this CD; I heard &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; in snippets on the radio/TV, I had to own it to get it outta my head!<br />This a remarkable disc, there are songs on it I remember from camp when I was younger, songs I remember my mom singing to me during car trips-songs that I didnt even know I knew.  Its got to be one of the best soundtracks of 2001 and one of the top 10 ever!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Please ignore some of the luke - warm reviews for Wilco's latest on this page. This is Jeff Tweedy's best stuff yet. You will not come across a more enjoyable, addictive, melodic, heart breaking, and life affirming album this year. Listening to it just makes the day better. It's that good.
B00005B36H|4.0|This CD is packaged beautifully, well All Tool Cd's are unique, but this one takes the cake.  Much like Jack Osbourne, my husband listens to this CD non stop
0140288503|5.0|I won't repeat what others have said. I'm a big fan of military novels and non-fiction...this rates among the best. simply sensational. on elong battle scene
006092988X|5.0|Much like Franny, when all else seems dull and I can't get up the effort to read anything, this book is my sour pickle to suck on.  Its a great read and a terrific re-read that always energizes me to start reading books again.  A terrific look at a poor family in Brooklyn, NY at the turn of the century; a Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a classic novel of hope and imagination.  Betty Smith is a fab. writer.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Sup yall? Before I say anything, lets get one thing str8. 2pac is the greatest of all time period. 4 anyone who doesnt know, the weak mag \\"the source\\" named Biggie as the greatest. No disrespect 2 B.I.G.(R.I.P.) because i will jam his music too, but 'Pac was and is the only rapper that can touch on each and every emotion that u can have as a human being, because he felt them all. Biggie was an excellent lyricist, and he would definetly slay any of the best today (Nas,Eminem) but 2pac can never be touched. Now, on his first album after his death (or his last album as some people view it) The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, I have to say that this is simply an untouchable album. From the first song (bomb first: my 2nd reply) this album is a jam. If u listen to this on a system in ur car, people will hear this from blocks away. Though it feels like a war cd, there are plenty of songs that speak on issues, songs that are just to jam, everything. Looking for a song if u want exact revenge on ur enemies? Play bomb first or against all odds. Looking for a song to just get down to and party? Put on toss it up. One of the tightest songs is \\"to live and die in l.a.\\" because if ur just driving around at about sunset, put this song on and it makes a tight effect because the way the beat is and the way that it is sunset just make u just feel like ur chillin and everything is good. Krazy is a song to listen to if u r reflecting or if u r having a bad day and u just need to chill. Either way u look at it, this cd is the jam. Also, alot of people may get offended by the cover. Look, it is not meant to disrespect Jesus Christ (in fact, at the bottom it says that). I really dont know what the cover is supposed to mean,but it may mean that he is maybe still alive and he will \\"ressurect\\", but this pic is in NO way meant to disrespect Jesus Christ. Also, if u listen closely to the album, u will hear alot of things that may make u think he is still alive. Play the very first song,andabout 2 seconds into the song u will hear a voice (i hear it is khadafi(r.i.p.)) that says \\"suge shot me\\". I dont know who put it in there or how it got in there, but it will make u think. Anyway, the controversial cover and mysterious things in it, this is an excellent album and should not be passed up by any rap fan, and especially any 2pac fan. R.I.P. to the greatest of all time, 2pac. Peace.
B00005B36H|1.0|I heard much of this album in my friend's truck today.  I used to listen to \\"AEnima\\" a few years ago when I was 16 or 17 and I was really p.o.ed at the world.  Now that I'm a little older and mature I just cannot take \\"metal\\" seriously as a musical genre anymore.  Some of you say Tool is not metal.  Fine.  You are entitled to your own opinion.  To me, they are not very musically interesting because they sound so much like the genre most of the time. \\"Lateralus\\" marks no true musical advances for Tool-this is the same metallic formula that sounded much fresher on \\"AEnima\\". I honestly can't say what new musical ideas are presented here and I highly doubt their next album will be a different case-they should have proven their staying power here. At least Radiohead (like them or not) still seem to rapidly evolving.  Wow, MJK is angry and screaming into the mike while heavy guitars pulsate in the background.  This music is more like the teen-angst ridden (c)rap metal currently in trend than most of you would care to admit.  But this is different all the fans say.  This is \\"intelligent metal\\".  That is one of the most annoying musical contridictions I have ever heard. To me, \\"metal\\" is a musical joke (Spinal Tap comes to mind) and the fact that Tool cannot acknowledge that make them all the more annoying. Many people listen to this and think they are intelligent. What they don't know is that there have been many great bands over the years with emotional depth that have not had to rely on a \\"metal-meathead\\" sound to make their point. Joy Division was such a band and more recently, the Swans have accomplished this. I suggest listening to the Swans later efforts if you cannot handle listening to pre-90s music. They are at least as good as Tool and musically much more unique and interesting. The fact that \\"The Great Annihilator\\" has a handful of reviews and this has about 1,000 doesn't say much for how willing people are to hunt out the exact music they are looking for. Stoplimiting yourself to what is current and heavily marketed to you-it won't kill you, unlike some have come to believe.

B00008973A|2.0|A Chorus Line was one of the biggest hit musicals ever with an incredibly long run on Broadway. Personally, I always thought it was a good, rather than a great, show. But even so, anyone who sees the film version without having first seen the show on stage could be forgiven for wondering what all the fuss was about. Hollywood does not have a very good track record in transferring Broadway classics to the stage. The usual reasons for this lack of success - mis-casting and the wrong director - are both evident in this film.<br /><br />After several false starts, the film was handed over to Dickie Attenborough, then riding high on his Gandhi success - though that would hardly seem to qualify him for directing a musical. Then we have Michael Douglas - a Hollywood star - in a show that is supposed to be about the anonymous gypsies who are Broadway dancers. Douglas plays Zach, the director/choreographer, although he never gives the slightest hint that he has any talent for either of these jobs (unlike Roy Scheider in All That Jazz). On stage, the director was primarily an off-stage voice, making only one brief stage appearance. In the film, he is the undeserved center of attention. Thus the whole point of the show begins to disappear.<br /><br />In building up the Zach role, the emphasis of his former girlfriend Cassie is also increased. So much so that the film could easily have been re-named Zach And Cassie - the chorus line are reduced to minor supporting roles instead of being the focus of attention. Too often, the dancers' stories are interrupted and even ruined by endless cutaways to closeups of Zach and Cassie looking tortured. Not to mention the totally pointless flashbacks. And is Cassie worth all this angst? As played by Alyson Reed, the answer is, frankly, no. When she finally gets to dance, there is nothing special - no obvious star quality. The song for her big solo is changed from the original to a quite banal and forgettable piece that has no hope of being the highlight it should be. Then, to make things even worse, the show's one popular hit - What I Did For Love - is taken away from Morales and the dancers and given to Cassie. So, instead of it being a song about the sacrifices that dancers are willing to make, it becomes Cassie's self-pity ditty. This, and other similar decisions, throw the entire show off balance and buries the whole point of A Chorus Line.<br /><br />In the end, there is little emotional engagement for the audience. The final selection of the dancers seems rather arbitrary and could just as easily have been made at the beginning of the process. Viewed strictly on its own terms, A Chorus Line is probably an enjoyable experience for many people. But, taken in context of the original and what it is all supposed to be about, the film version is both disappointing and mediocre.ing the highlight it should be.

B00006690F|5.0|I bought this CD because his first single was fresh as all get out and I remember how much fun his last album provided.  This album is nothing short of FANTASTIC.  As with any album there are tunes that I dont right away jive with, and it is a rare occurence in this case, there are so many.  Business is incredible, musically, lyrically, and energy wise, awesome, and Dre's Hell Yeah puts a stride in my step.  Without me of course is without a doubt brilliant, especially the line \\"I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley, to do Black music so selfishly and use it to get wealthy.\\"  hilarious and true, and executed so well.  Till I collapse is a song that may inspire someone down and out, and musically once again Nate Dogg makes a triumphant appearance and leaves us with a hook that wont go away.  The album made me laugh and it is littered with honesty and truth, and frankly in today's world we need it.  And big-ball-ups to EM for rapping about planes and terrorists and America.  Oh, yeah, the trailer for 8 Mile, looks really well-done.  ...
B00000K19E|5.0|I first saw this movie at camp, and when it ended, I was hooked.  I now own this FX masterpiece and I am glad I spent the money.  This movie is worth  buying and you definetly will get your money's worth!
630281474X|5.0|It may come as a shock to many of today's moviegoers that the aristocratic Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones is not the first role in which veteran actor Christopher Lee has been called upon to play a dark clad, all but invincible emissary of evil.  Indeed, Lee became a star playing yet another wicked count:  Dracula.<br />Produced by the now-legendary Hammer Films in 1957 as a follow-up to their successful Curse of Frankenstein shocker, Horror of Dracula was the first major effort to revive the undead Count since Bela Lugosi's immortal performance.  Filmed in brilliant blood-red color on dreamy, gothic sets of the imagination, Horror of Dracula gave horror fans a more erotic, exciting version of Bram Stoker's tale than any Universal had produced.  For the record, Horror of Dracula does not adhere to the source novel very closely; there has never been a faithful adaptation of Stoker's novel, and it says something that even though Christopher Lee would play Dracula over and over, he always lamented that he never really got to perform the book.  Even so, Horror of Dracula is an entertaining gothic nightmare that holds up against the best vampire films of today, and if it is not faithful to the letter of Stoker's book, it is surely faithful to its spirit.<br />There are many reasons why this film works, not the least of them being Lee himself.  Lee's Dracula is a fiery-eyed, cold-hearted devil at once alluring and malevolent, mysterious but charming, reserved yet explosive--dead but not-dead.  But, as hinted at in Stoker's book, Lee's Dracula can know love, albeit of an obscene sort.  Indeed, in this movie Dracula battens upon Jonathan Harker's fiance not out of random hunger, but revenge--for Harker has killed Dracula's own vampire bride, and Dracula will have Harker's woman in her place.<br />Is Lee's performance better than Lugosi's?  Probably not, but it is an original, perfectly valid interpretation in its own right, and one Lee certainly carries off splendidly.From Lee's first shadow-veiled appearance as the Count to the final showdown with vampire hunter Van Helsing, the viewer is spellbound.<br />As the aformentioned Dr. Van Helsing, the great Peter Cushing is just as vital to the picture as cohort Lee.  Cushing's Van Helsing may not be Stoker's vision of the character, but he is nonetheless an engaging, powerful presence that is Dracula's one worthy foe.  Some find Cushing's Van Helsing cold and unsympathetic, but this view misses the point.  Cushing is here not at all cold; indeed, he goes to great pains to help Dracula's victims and grieves when one of them falls.  But he knows the evil he is up against, and will stop at nothing to rid the world of it once and for all.  Far from being cold, Cushing is a crusader inflamed with the desire to defeat Dracula at any cost.  In any event, Cushing handles the role flawlessly and, true to Stoker or not, makes it his own.<br />The rest of the excellent cast and crew adds immeasurably to the production.  Hammer became famous for its clique of talented, thoroughly professional actors and its voluptuous, alluring  actresses, and those thespian assets are strongly displayed in Horror of Dracula.  Director Terrence Fisher orchestrates the mystery and horror of this gothic fairy tale with a magic wand, and Jimmy Sangster's script is a masterpiece of horror movie literature.<br />From the intimidating opening shots of Dracula's castle and blood-spattered tomb, to the Count's irresistible seduction of young Lucy, through the thrilling cat & mouse game of wits between Dracula and Van Helsing to its breathtaking climax, Horror of Dracula is a classy gothic fantasy unlike any other version of Stoker's classic.  Almost certainly the most charismatic and exciting of all Dracula films, Horror of Dracula will entertain and thrill movie lovers as long as here are horror movies.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I was extremely disappointed with this LA Genre flick, which should have pulled the talents of the assembled performers together but only set hem apart. Disjointed, tiresome and taking way too long to establish the plot line, this was mostly a waste of time and talent.<BR>It is beyond my comprehension that this would make anyone's top 10
B00005QGAT|5.0|This Off The Wall cd is surely bouncing off the wall with all the hits that it contains.

This is a collectors item and a must have. One Love
B00005Q45W|3.0|Leonard Cohen is among the best artists of our time. He is a master poet and crafts a soul to his work like no other. What always set Cohen apart from others is the intimacy he creates with the listener. That is why when I listened to &quot;Ten New Songs&quot; I was disappointed to find that intimacy lacking.<br />Musically speaking I've heard better on early Casio keyboards... which for some of the tracks I'm convinced they used. If you are a Leonard Cohen fan buy it for your collection, if not I suggest one of his earlier works.
B000063S6Z|4.0|If you are a Moby fan you know the history by know, but I suppose it bears repeating. Boy likes music, boy plays music, radio does not listen,boy writes music for soundtracks, boy trys new genre, radion does not listen, every song boy writes is on at least one soundtrack, radio finally listens.  Now, we are listening.  Ok, boy did it back asswards, but it worked.  Moby does not venture too far away from the \\"Play\\" formula that made him a household name on \\"18.\\"  Mostly, this record is the deep synth riffs, over some blues vocal with an electronic beat.  Again, he has help with the vocals, Sinead O'Connor and others lend out their vocal chords.  Even though the music and forumla is familiar to \\"Play\\" this record is deeper and more stable.  Moby has developed and constructed beautiful music on \\"18\\" and whether this is your first Moby record, or if you have his previous records, this is a must listen and needed addition to your library.  I have listened to the record 3 times now and it keeps getting better.
B00006690F|5.0|I must say that i was a devot Eminem protester, but my husband loves his music.  I bought this CD to humor him and i take back every bad thing i said.<br />The music was genuine and powerful with excellent beats and rhymes.  His music is underated and those who listen to this CD with an open mind will feel the same.<br />His attmept at singing a ballad to his little daughter sounds like a Backstreet Boy audition, but the words were so heart- felt. The CD has wisdom, it has answers, and it could makes you want to dance.  This album is wonderful and i must say, he make some very valid points.  He speaks of Sept 11, discrimination, consequenses of frivilous sex, the love of his daughter, and that he has no regrets.  THis CD has the songs of our generation.  Think Bob Dylan and George Harrison of this era.
B00006690F|5.0|This is eminems best cd.  Every song is awsome.  Its more serious than his last ones and it is better than them too.  I dont know how he is gunna make one better than this!
B00006690F|5.0|This boy is just nice... regardless of color or whatever.  I dare anyone to name someone more lyrically gifted right about now.  Hip-hop is struggling lately, with all REMIXES and everything pretty much sounding the same.  Slim continues to evolve as an artist.  His best album yet...
B0000025T6|4.0|It doesn't get much bleaker than Nebraska.  If this album fails to depress and even scare you a little, you aren't listening.  I pull this one out late at night and just soak it in.  A man and his guitar making beautiful music that rarely rises much above the level of a whisper.  My favorite tracks here are `Nebraska', `Mansion on the Hill', and `My Father's House', but this is really an album that should be listened to as a whole. Every song tells a story and these stories don't often have happy endings.<br />With the exception of the occasional spin of `Atlantic City', you aren't going to hear any of these songs on the radio.  And thank goodness for that.  Let the masses have `Born in the USA'.  Nebraska is a gift to those that are willing to dig a little deeper.
B00005JKCF|5.0|excellent film...as i have now just seen it for the third time i can truly say this is an excellent film..tobey macquire was a sound choice and fits the role perfectly. i believe CLAIR FORLANI would have been much better suited for the mary jane role, but kirsten dunst is adequate.Throughout the entire movie the writers/director manage to keep you well interested (albiet three times) while keeping a brisk pace,and yet doing a fine job of following the origins of spider-man (for the die-hards)<br />needless to say this has already made my list for dvd's.and i can't wait for sequels.
B00004XONN|1.0|Radiohead, grant you, is definatly one of my all time favorite bands. In addition, I think great britan has some of the best music you can find, and I think radiohead is the best to come from that country.  I bought &quot;OK Computer&quot; for a used price through a recomendation-*STUPID*-I hadn't really heard them, and remained in my cd player for god knows how long.  Shortly after I purchased &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and liked it even better!  So comming from these happening I can't find a decent explanation from the amissity of this album.  I can't say that they have lost thier feel, because Amnesiac was actually a pretty good album.  But either way, &quot;Kid A&quot; cannot be dealt with.  This is what we normally refer to as bad music, folks, and, being a music lover from Cat Stevens to System of a Down, I can say this has to be posssibly the worst effort of 2000, maybe even the 90s!  All songs are slow, downbeat, uninteresting, terrible song writing, and I don't see what Thom York was on when he thought the public would like this album!  No wonder it flopped!  The only half-way decent song is &quot;optomistic.&quot;
6301969294|3.0|I guess some people might see Ayn Rand's characters as without emotion... but the acting in this film is very stiff.  I don't think Ayn Rand saw her characters without emotion, just with controlled emotion.
B00006690G|5.0|I hate to parrot the Amazon official review, but I'm finding that it is pretty spot-on in my opinion.  This album is pretty solid, and the whole \\"I don't have a persona\\" persona is really paying off for Shady.  I don't consider myself a hardcore fan by any means, but I found myself liking most of the tracks and skits on the cd.  Dre collaborations are definitely not overused, and Slim's crew offer support in a variety of great ways.<br />\\"White America\\" made me smile right off the bat, the \\"I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!\\" line is hilarious.  \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" is indeed brutal and unwincing, and the rhymes definitely testify to his skill.  I think it made me hate his mother almost as much as he does.  \\"Square Dance\\" should made anyone young paying close attention feel at least a little uneasy about being drafted.  \\"Without Me\\" is catch as heck, and seems like a fun live track as well, as shown at Eminem's performance on SNL recently.  It goes on and on.  Perhaps the only song I'm not so fond of is \\"Sing for the Moment,\\" which features some not-so-great sampling which seems more appropriate for a Puff Daddy track.  Eninem's best when it's his own rhymes and beats filling up the song.<br />Another thing I must mention is that this makes me more interested in seeing 8Mile, the upcoming movie Shady is doing.  \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" is featured in the trailer, and \\"The Kiss\\" skit sounds it's from the movie rather than a standalone skit, but I could be wrong.  Regardless, if there are any good tracks that Eminem was holding out for the movie, and if they're the same quality as this effort, it should be worth seeing, or at least getting the soundtrack.

B00003CXI1|3.0|Arguably, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will certainly become an all time classic, in the same vein as the Wizard of Oz.<BR>I couldn't wait for my DVD to arrive in the mail...I've been counting down the days!  We enjoyed it immensely and can't imagine ever getting tired of seeing it over and over again.  However....our excitement at viewing the &quot;extra features&quot; available on the DVD quickly grew to frustration.  You are not able to simply select and view the &quot;never before seen footage&quot;, as you can on other DVDs.  I've since learned this feature is &quot;hidden&quot; somewhere on disc 2...I've also read that children can more easily find this feature...perhaps.  My daughter is just as big a fan as I, except that she is only 3 years old, and as intelligent as she is, can not navigate around that DVD, looking for the extra footage.  It is most annoying-they should have thought better than to hide what is to be a highly anticipated feature.
B000065V41|5.0|\\"Muppet's Christmas Carol\\" manages the almost impossible task of merging Dicken's haunting ghost story of loss and redemption with Henson's style of wacky, screwball comedy and Muppets.  I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I do.<br />Michael Cain is well suited to the role of Ebenezer Scrooge, and plays the character as the nasty old man that Scrooge is.   It takes an actor of his caliber to threaten Muppets!  The Muppets themselves are in full form, ranging from familiar faces like Kermit the Frog and Mrs. Piggy, to characters created just for the Christmas Carol.  Sadly, this is the first Muppet movie after the passing of Jim Henson, but Steve Whitmire fills his shoes just fine.  Of all the characters, the Ghost of Christmas Past is my favorite.   The aging giant is as amiable as any live actor to play the part. <br />Suprisingly, the musical numbers are quite catchy and enjoyable.  I would happily buy a soundtrack version.  Much of the original Dickens dialog is retained, and there is no attempt to soften or update the story.  It is an abridged version, and most of the usual cuts happen.  <br />This has become as much a Holiday classic for my family as \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" or \\"White Christmas.\\"

B00005YW4H|1.0|If you're like me--and looking for a new female vocalist that has some vision and personality in the jazz genre, here's another woeful disappointment.  Continuing along the slippery slope begun by Diana Krall (who at least has SOME jazz chops)  we hit mid-slope with Jane Monheit, and with Ms. Jones, we have probably not yet hit bottom.  At least she does have a voice, and does not contort the music beyond recognition. She's obviously listened to lots of Bonnie Raitt. Perhaps she has a niche in Nashville.  But please, please, please don't call it jazz.

B00003CXI1|4.0|I was disappointed by the special features bonus dvd in this set. The games are overly simple once you can figure out how to navigate by selecting the item covered by sparkles. The tour of Hogwarts seemed distorted, slow and choppy. The seven bonus scenes were mildly interesting, certainly not worth all the effort to get to them. [Hint: Go to classrooms, click on podium supporting the fire. Continue through a few more obstacles, you'll then be taken to hallway with portraits that include the scenes.]I would have also liked to have seen interviews with the cast in addition to the 15 minutes with the directors. The packaging is flimsy. I don't think the cardboard will hold up to the use it will be getting.<br />All that said, I loved the movie almost as much as I love the books.

B00005YXZH|4.0|I never really went for Wilco before - Ok songwriting but basically just inoffensive country rock - nothing exciting. Until this. Oh wow this is good. The negative reviews are the typical 'they've changed and I don't like change' reviews that every band gets when they alter their style  (some fools acted that way when U2 released Achtung baby, or the Beatles did Revolver). Try to forget its Wilco - just listen to it as itself.<br />If you like your music safe, mainstream &amp; MOR, don't bother. if you like to hear something that sounds like itself and itself alone, this is for you.<br />The centrepiece for me is the quite quite brilliant 'Jesus etc.', the best song Neil Finn never wrote. Quite quite gorgeous.<br />And the cover art is superb.
0790749556|4.0|The setting is the beau monde of Paris in the Thirties, when White Russian émigrés, some 15 years after the revolution, were as common as Cubans in Miami after Castro. Irene Dunne plays a Russian princess, involved in a rather unfocused but fraught romance with Randolf Scott.<br />I found this Russian angle charming; I knew it from reading Nabokov, but always assumed the Russian subculture was obscure and furtive. Not at all; these former counts and princes are driving cabs and waiting tables, but still manage to live life with style.<br /> Meanwhile, Fred and Ginger are having their usual light-hearted affair, Americans in Paris trying to make a living. He's a bandleader and she's a singer. (They both dance, too...)<br />There is a scene about one-third of the way through this movie, after Fred and Ginger have convinced a club owner to use their act. Ginger is rehearsing a song with the band (\\"Hard to Handle\\"); she finishes and joins Fred, who is lounging on the adjoining stairs. He's wearing slacks with a handkerchief in lieu of a belt, and a shirt and tie, but still looks informal. They start kidding, then dancing and singing. Naturally they rehearsed this spontaneous scene before filming it, but it is still powerful. Virginia was 23 or 24, Fred 35 or 36 when this movie was being made. She was gorgeous, and he was Astaire, and they were both on top of their game, lithe and quick: they were attractive in a way you don't see much anymore.<br />The plot of this movie is silly enough, but Jerome Kern's music is beautiful (\\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,\\" \\"Lovely to Look At\\", \\"Yesterdays\\", \\"I Won't Dance\\"). What is more, we get those expatriate Russian aristocrats, and Fred playing a mean jazz piano. And always, of course, Fred and Ginger dancing. Who could ask for anything more?

I was glued to my seat, I was fascinated by the talent these performers posessed, and I was loving every minute of it! Then....they went to the theatre??? I continued to watch just as enthralled as before waiting for that magic moment, waiting for that missing piece of the puzzle that would bring it all together, that never happened. So now im conflicted do I beat the hell out of the guy who referred it to me? or, do I thank him for introducing me to such an incredible display of film talent? Maybe both...
0240801962|5.0|This book is an absolute must-have for the experienced printer who wants to step up to the next level.  The wealth of information he provides,  from technical to historical,  is extremely interesting,  albeit a bit dizzying at times.  However,  the book can be used as a reference as needed for information on specific chemicals, formulas,  or resources for supplies and equipment.  Of  all the books that I have read on printing,  this is the one that has been most useful.
B00006690F|4.0|Since I have bought this CD, I have been listening to it non-stop. With great remix's of Aerosmith and Queen, Eminem shows that he too has a fondness of rock roots. With the exception of maybe 5 songs on this CD, I would recommend this to anyone who loves Rap/Hip-Hop/Beats. The bass lines and beats on this album are stunning enough to rationalize getting a subwoofer in a car. Overall, I gave it 4 because not every song is amazing, like I said, about 5 at most arent, but the lyrics/beats are unreal.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|Imagine going into an old lunatic asylum after its been closed down for 15 years...a scary thought.  Especially walking around in  the old tunnels and hall ways and thinking about what all took place.  Session 9 is  truly a remarkable horror film.  It can be compared greatly with Stanley Kubrick's The Shining  and is all about atmosphere, and a dream like setting.  Session 9 uses alot of tracking shots as used in The Shining.  A crew of asbestos removers are sent into the old asylum to clean up the place and the weakest one in the party becomes possessed by the asylums twisted past.  A must see for any real horror fan.
B00003W8NM|5.0|It's hard to limit one's review of Fight Club. It's such a great movie and there is so much going on that I could write pages on it. But I'll do my best to keep it short. In my opinion this is one of the best movies, not just of our time, but of all times. The story is so full of political, social, and philosophical statements and themes, and there is so much going on in every scene that you can't just watch it once or twice or even three times. This movie demands to be watched over and over. To start with we have one of the best directors of his generation: David Fincher. I've no doubt that he'll one day take his place among the greats: Hitchcock and Kubrick. It has two of the best living actors, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who so fit their character that it is easy to forget that they are not Tyler Durden and Jack. And Helena Bonham-Carter is heartbreaking in this movie. The set design, wardrobe, and special effects are spectacular, but without overshadowing the story itself. This movie ranks with Citizen Kane, North By Northwest, and the Star Wars trilogy as the best movies of all times. <br />Now for the dvd. First of all whoever designed the packaging did a brilliant job. It is a two disc set in a slipcover case designed in such a way that you can think of no better packaging for this movie. It even includes a small booklet \\"How to Start a Fight\\" which various members of the production staff chronicle the making of the movie. They even include quotes from reviewers, both good and bad. Disc One contains four commentaries. The first is David Fincher alone, and his commentary puts so much insight into the film you have to watch it again immediately after the commentary. The second commentary is Fincher, Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena. And if you thought that Fincher put in as much insight as he could in the first commentary then you'd be wrong. The third commentary is the novelist, Chuck Palahniuk, and screenwriter Jim Uhls. They add another level of meaning tothe movie. And it is especially nice to hear Palahniuk's take on the movie. The final commentary contains five important members of production. Director of Photographer Jeff Cronenweth, costume designer Michael Kaplan, production designer, Alex McDowell, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Haug, all of who add another level of understanding to the movie. There is even a little bit of Doc Baily who was the digital animator of the final scene. Disc Two contains all sorts of supplemental material such as outtakes, deleted scenes, 17 behind the scene vignettes, publicity, and more. <br />All in all this is a smart movie that everyone should watch (and let's not forget, this movie is hilarious). And as a dvd, it is what all dvds should be made like.
B00006690F|5.0|My friend bought this cd on saturday, and when we got into my car I turned it on.  The lyrics may be a little obcsene at times, but they are deep.  He's saying what others think and are afraid to say.  So when these tunes are blastin, your lettin people know abouyt you too.  Also the bass is incredible and so are the ways that he can manipulate a sentance in order to mean something incredible.<BR>I would recomend this CD to anyone.  And am going to buy it when I get enough money.  It is a must buy own.  To sum it up: The rymes is sick.
0767805712|5.0|this movie is great.  it was edge of your seat action
080013558X|5.0|Sure, the 1982 movie doesn't compare to the stage version.  Getting rid of the Christmas setting and replacing some great songs with the likes of &quot;Dumb Dog&quot; may not have been a great idea.<br />BUT, Albert Finney shows wonderful character development (there's none with Warbucks in the Disney version).  Annie is much spunkier (perhaps overacted, but any spunk is better than no spunk).  Carol Burnett plays Miss Hannigan with comedic genius.  I shudder to even compare her to Disney's &quot;politically correct&quot; Hannigan played by the slothful Kathy Bates.  How can you go wrong with Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters, too.<br />The choreography is athletic and spirited in this version.  The disney version's choreography looked like a poor camp production.<br />Yes, there are some mix-ups in the setting of the buildings in the background as well as some other things, but this is a very enjoyable musical which, thanks to its whitty script, score, and talent, succeeds on many levels.<br />Perhaps the best way to describe this movie is:<br />A MUSICAL THAT SUCCEEDS INCREDIBLY DESPITE ITSELF.
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt bring back the imagenation and playfulness back in pop/rock with &quot;Rock Steady&quot;-arguably their most enjoyable (not best) album.<br />Gwen Stefani is the defintly the next Madonna-in-waiting and funky party pop like &quot;Hella Good&quot;,&quot;Hey Baby&quot;(blessed by Bounty Killer),&quot;Start The Fire&quot;,and the steamy Prince-assisted &quot;Waiting Room&quot; all get the party started right.<br />Whether you're a N'Sync fan or a Nas fan or a Metaillca fan,<BR>you CAN'T turn on this album and not have fun!!
B00006690F|4.0|Dont get me wrong I think this is a great cd.  Its just not as funny as you would expect from eminem.  There is a lot of political stuff on the cd, and it seems more serious than the others. I guess you just cant do the same thing all the time.  And I think that Halie song that he sings on and doest rap much is kinda [different].  But I dont have kids so I wouldnt know.  Well, this is a great album so buy it, and make eminem more rich than he already is.
0671027344|4.0|Stephen Chbosky's first novel is funny, touching, memorable and with precise accuracy and precision depicts the voice of a boy in brink of adulthood trying to place himself in a ever changing world of deceitful appearances and every day small talk. Charlie is incredibly intelligent which is demonstrated by the commentary he gives on the games his fellow peers play and the hypocrisy of them. Yet he does not judge on them. Charlie is merely a spectator in a world that revolves around magazines and love hate relationships. The tittle of the book indicates he is a wallflower. Charlie speaks through letters to a anonymous person which later on in the book it is revealed that person is associated with is past. The letters follow the format a story teller would use describing his many anecdotes in a entertaining and engaging way. They in a sense are a journal of his daily activities. His personal trials and tribulations are easily relatable to anyone attending high school. With the help of his close group of friends consisting of Samantha, Patrick and Bill he manages to avoid depression for most part of the book but the shocking revelation of the abuse done to him by his Aunt Helen sends him into a psychotic world. He recovers to tie loose ends in the epilogue and start his sophomore year.<br />The book contains some well written fiction that emerges the reader in the point of view of Charlie. At times some letters are incoherent and incomprehensible until it is revealed that Charlie was doing drugs at that point in time. This book makes a good read for high school due to the probable empathy shared by high school age readers  and the ambiguity between the books reality and readers reality. With all its good qualities the plot is predictable half way through the book, hence the four star rating. This embellishes  from the joy of reading the book. Yet the remainder of the entertaining letters redeem the book as a whole. As said earlier \\"predictable yet enjoyable\\".
B000003BDJ|5.0|This two-CD set provides seven years worth of vintage Stones. Compare these delectable tracks to the rock music of today and one wonders where things went wrong in the mainstream. Melodic, meaningful, powerful and innovative, these Stones songs represent everything that is special about rock music. Although there's not one mediocre track here, my favorites include the bluesy Time Is On My Side, Heart Of Stone, Wild Horses and Ruby Tuesday (covered by Melanie Safka among others), the raucous rock of Satisfaction, Get Off My Cloud, Street Fighting Man and Brown Sugar, with songs of social comment (Mother's Little Helper, 19th Nervous Breakdown), and beautiful ballads: As Tears Go By (covered by inter alia Marianne Faithfull), Play With Fire and Paint It Black. The Stones must be the ultimate rock band, more influential than the Beatles in their 4 decades plus consistency and their exploration of the wilder side of life. This is an absolute masterpiece. If an alien came down and asked me to recommend some quality rock music, this album will top my list. It deserves 7 stars!
B00003CXI1|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I bought the 2-disc DVD set and have watched it 4 times already! I haven't read the books yet and am a little unsure as to whether or not I am going to read them before or after I see the next movies. I think that I will probably break down and read them. The scenery in this movie is absolutly amazing! And the kids that they chose did a very good job. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B000002U9W|5.0|Not only is Atom Heart Mother a superb reflection of Pink Floyd's innovative nature, but it also contains some absolutely brilliant music. It would be wrong to call this a \\"prog rock\\" album as that immediately puts the band into a category with ELP and friends, which seems silly when you look at the scope of Floyd's music, which goes well beyond the confines of quasi-classical pomp rock. Pink Floyd represent the good side of progressive music. The side which is a progressive embrace of the arts rather than just a dismissive pigeon-hole.<BR>Atom Heart Mother opens with a sprawling epic, which encompasses everything from funk to classical, from dissonant keyboard experiments to soaring guitar and organ duals between Dave and Rick. In typically off-the-wall-and-out-of-the-window fashion the band employed avant garde' composer Ron Geesin and crafted an orchestrated masterpiece around a brilliant collection of themes, melodies, rhythms and timeless Gilmour soloes. The composition exceeds twenty three minutes and is divided into six parts (all of which, it appears, are about cows) including the cannily titled \\"Mind your throats please\\". It may not be the most accessable album opener but it can't be over-emphasised how GOOD this piece is.<BR>On the second side Roger's obscure genius shines on the subtle ballad \\"If\\", with lyrics which ponder on the inexplainable flaws of humans and the threat of madness (\\"If I go insane, please don't put your wires in my brain\\").<BR>\\"Summer '68\\", Rick's bouncey pop song, has an irresistable rhythmic drive and and a wonderful clashing of horns, acoustic strumming and great piano playing.<BR>Dave's graceful \\"Fat old sun\\" is one of the best songs in the history of the world, topped off with a real diamond of a guitar solo.<BR>Running on surprisingly long for a 1970 album, ATM continues with the dodgy three part instrumental \\"Alan's psychedelic Breakfast\\". The daft but amusing sound effects and some pleasant guitar and keyboard noodlings make the first two sections highly enjoyable but the piece really gets going with the uplifting jam at the end.<BR>All-in-all this is a must have album for Floyd fans and, if you're feeling adventurous, not a bad place to start for new-comers interested in the pre-darkside Floyd. It's a long way from radio friendly but a person with good taste should recognise this as one of the most creative albums of all time whether they already like the band or not (and Pink Floyd were very much a band in 1970).
0345440900|5.0|At 3 weeks of age my twin girls were eating me alive. I was convinced that this was not normal, and I was totally exhausted, the feed on demand and the holding and crying were just too much. I had read several parenting books while pregnant and visited the websites on multiples etc But nothing prepared me for this.<br />Ms.Hoggs book stuck in my mind for 2 reasons, (1) it is how I imagined parenting to be and (2) because I have a 2 yr old and did not want to have the same AP issues I have with him. Alot of what Ms. Hogg speaks about is common sense which I admittedly took for granted at first, but later found her words to ring true. But as you know common sense is the first thing that goes through the window when your back is against the wall. <br />I attempted to read the book again, but in between feedings, dirty diapers, holding my girls to sleep, constant battles with my 2 yr old, who was also up twice in the night, time for myself was an impossible luxury. My hubby helped as much as possible, but we were at breaking point just after 3 weeks.<br />So I decided to call the author from the web address and actually see if Ms. Hogg stood true to her words. I found this service unique, as no one else writing books makes themselves available and puts into practice what they preach.<br />After waiting a few days for an appointment I had mixed thoughts on the conversation I was about to have. But was assured by her staff that Ms. Hogg would not only provide a care plan for my twin girls to sleep through the night, but would also have my son sleeping through the night. WOW I thought some promise !!<br />Well my girls are 7 1/2 weeks now and have been sleeping through the night for almost 2 weeks, the crying as stopped, and they are happy smiley babies what a joy. And my son sleeps in his own bed all night without a peep. My husband is totally amazed. I even have the time to spend writing this comment.<br />This book did not have that initial impact on me and as Ms. Hogghad mentioned to me, it is difficult to write a book that covers every unique situation given the uniqueness of every family in the world, it is apparent that her advice is from experience worldwide. I totally agree with her when she says that parenting starts from birth and not at 3 months, and that we have to be more concious parents, and think things through something I was not doing.<br />My experience as a parent as grown 10 fold over the past few weeks, I feel empowered, I have a clear mind and a spring in my step. I have even had time to read the book again and now I am on her Toddler book. <br />Ms Hogg is totally ahead of her field. Read her books until you get her philosophy, forget taking what you can from different books, this is it, the penny has to drop. What I say to AP (Attachment parents) DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK it is not for you, adopt the right parenting style for your family and stick with it. It has nothing to offer AP something I did with my son and have lived to regret some of the behaviours.<br />This book is a New York Times Best Seller and I haven't seen any other parenting books up there with the likes of John Grisham  their comments are<br />Buy This Book Today and Sleep Tonight<br />I found Ms. Hogg tentative, reassuring, empowering, witty, polite, an encyclopedia of knowledge and best of all human.<br />Thank You !! From Dianna, Stephan son Jordan & Twins Rebecca /Natalie
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem is back, and has pretty much started right were he left off. The best songs were white america, without me, say what you say. There were also a few differnt songs, like Haile Song. I basically got the dvd for free. I really wasn't expecting much from this dvd but it did give you some information. It shows you some concerts, music videos, and there are some 1 on 1 interviews. I think that this cd is far less contrversial than the other ones. The language dropped a lot. Overall this is his best cd.
0451169514|3.0|It's greatest curse is its length  -  the thing is worse than the Energizer Bunny, it just keeps going, and going, and going  -  and an ill-defined villain.  It also suffers from unbelievable (though admittedly appealing) characters, and stock King situations.<br />The villainous \\"It\\" of the title is a God-Knows-What  -  an unexplained shapeshifting Something  -  that is inconsistent and incomprehensible, making it hard for the reader to get a handle on.  Its limitations are unclear, so the hapless band of heroes' eventual dispatch of the thing doesn't make much sense...or if it does, that sense isn't explained sufficiently for the reader to understand.<br />In common with some of Dean Koontz's less believable efforts, King's characters in this piece suffer from Cinderella Syndrome  -  i.e., just how many people from one small, backward town can grow up to become nationally rich and famous?  One is a famous author, another a stand-up comedian who regularly appears on The Tonight Show, etc.  These kind of characters are manipulatively contrived to appeal to a Yuppie audience, and even they should have a hard time believing them.<br />Despite these drawbacks, It is at least a good read.  The horror goes way over-the-top, far worse even than most of the author's efforts, but there are many very well-written individual scenes.  The characters are likeable and fully drawn, which goes a long way toward burying the book's other sins.  The plot is lengthy and involving, spanning generations, and as usual King's attention to detail is pretty thorough.<br />Not the author's best, and not the best piece of his to start out on if you're a new reader.  But worthwhile if you're a fan, or just want to kill a lot of time in fairly enjoyable fashion.  (A LOT of time.)  The miniseries, if you're interested, is a faithful adaptation.
6302878527|5.0|Great fun picking out situations and saying &quot;Can't Do That Anymore&quot;  Example - smoking on airplanes.  See how many you can find and there are many.<br />Great 60's clothes - cars - music.<br />Hepburn and Finney at their young and loveliest.  (Hard to believe this is the same bloke who is currently playing on HBO as Churchill in &quot;Gathering Storm&quot; - which is brilliant!)
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank was a real Jewish girl that lived with her mom, dad, sister, and four other people.  They were all hiding from the Nazis because they didn't want to be placed in concentration camps where they would most likely die.  They lived in constant fear and isolation of the rest of the world.  Anne Frank's diary showed that even if the Jewish people that she lived with struggled with so many problems, they never gave up.  I think that that's the kind of mentality that we should withhold each and every day.  They were set into concentration camps and all of them died except for the father, Otto Frank.  He survived and went back to his home where he found Anne's journal and published it.  It shows what such hatred can do to people.<br />I enjoyed this book because it showed that even a girl my age can truly be negatively effected in a situation of hatred and how much pain that she must have suffered.  When she went into the concentration camp, my heart was heavy for her because I had a feeling that she was going to die because not many survived.  It was also interesting to read about these eight rightfully scared-silly characters fighting over all of their little problems when there was a more important worldly problem.<br />My favorite part is when Otto Frank comes back because I thought to myself that if he hadn't come back, the book would have probably never gotten published in the first place.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Harry Potter, the source of mass obsession and hysteria, has finally come to video stores.  I ordered my copy of the widescreen edition through Amazon and was excited when it arrived in the mail.  I hurriedly took it out of the box and sat down to look at all of the DVD options and extras.<br />The Harry Potter DVD is a two disk set with the movie and trailers on one disk and tours of Hogwarts and Diagon Alley as well as other things to explore on disk two.  To this point, I haven't explored all of the options the DVD has to offer, but I have taken a small tour through the Gryffindore Commons.<br />The movie itself is of excellent quality, and the widescreen makes it that much more enjoyable since the movie has a lot of motion made for a big screen.<br />I'm slightly confused about the features this DVD has.  I was under the assumption that there was bonus footage and what not, but cannot be found on the second disk.  This footage is probably in the movie itself if not hidden somewhere in the DVD menu.  For those who have a DVD CD-ROM the second disk has many other things to explore, but sadly I do not own a DVD CD-ROM.  Others may experience this problem.<br />Overall, Harry Potter has made it to my home and is proudly displayed in my DVD collection.  For those interested in adding this to his collection it is worth to spend a little more for the widescreen edition.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtack is everything rolled into one- it will make you cry, it will make you smile, its fun and its sinister, its heart warming and heart breaking. The music is wonderfully composed, and Enya is the heart and soul of Lord of the Rings- simply beautiful. It is totally perfect for the film, and listening to the soundtrack brings back all the emotions of seeing it on screen. A must have, especially if youre a fan of the movie, but even if you are not. Dont delay, get it now!

0380789035|3.0|Neil Gaiman's &quot;American Gods&quot;, an intentionally oxymoronic title, is about the impending battle between the old gods (pick your poison: Odin, Loki, Vishnu, etc.) and the &quot;new&quot; (junk culture: TV, advertising, gambling, etc.).  Stuck in the middle waiting to find out his destiny is a mortal man named Shadow.  Soon to be released from jail, Shadow looks forward to a reunion with his wife Laura.  Sadly, this reunion is not to be (or, it is not to be in the way Shadow envisions it).  Shadow, stricken by grief, is thus enlisted in a battle, one that may decide the fate of the world, by a mysterious man named Wednesday.<br />Similar thematic territory was covered, with much more panache and verve, by Douglas Adams (&quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;) and by Neil's &quot;Good Omens&quot; writing partner, Terry Pratchett (&quot;Small Gods&quot;).  Both books took a sidelong glance at the subject of modern deities and found an awful lot of humour there.  Gaiman treats his subject with solemnity, and to my mind this is one of the reasons why the book suffers.<br />Fortunately, the story begins with a dramatic bang.  Gaiman sets up his characters well, and then proceeds to create the universe in which they will live.  He never betrays the beginning, but at times he lets the narrative (or, to describe it more accurately, the loose assemblage of scenes) get away from him.  &quot;I feel like I'm in a world with its own sense of logic.  It's own rules,&quot; Shadow notes at one point early on.  &quot;I'm just going along with it, you know?&quot;  This is true, and it begins as a wonderful creation in Gaiman's hands.  But later Shadow becomes more frustrated with the direction his life has taken:  &quot;Nobody tells me what [the rules] are.  You keep talking about the goddamn rules, I don't even know what game you people are playing.&quot;  This kind of frustration seeps into the reader's thoughts as well.  Gaiman takes great care in hiding his motivations from both his character and his audience.  You keep expecting a payoff, where the rules are explained, at least implicitly.  But that rarely happens, and when it does it is quite unsatisfactory.<br />He also neglects to assemble a unifying narrative.  What we have, instead, is an extended version of 'variations on a theme'.  Shadow's adventures, although different and interesting every time, still follow the same basic formula.  It becomes tiresome after a while.  And what narrative it does have goes on for far too long.  &quot;Not only are there no happy endings,&quot; someone says near the end, &quot;there aren't even any endings.&quot;  Too true in this case.  Further complicating things is the fact that this book has both an epilogue and a postscript.  Gaiman may not have wanted to leave the world he's created, but the reader can't wait for it to finally be over.<br />All that being said, there are moments here that carry a tremendous amount of stark weight.  One scene, at an odd boarding house, has Shadow losing a game of checkers only to face a frightening punishment: a sledgehammer to the head.  Thankfully, he's able to put it off.  Or is he?  Later, we see Shadow in a moment of extreme sacrifice.  Gaiman's descriptions of the broken man's thoughts in this chapter are heartbreaking, and believably authentic.  The scenes in Lakeside, a small-town safe haven, if taken on their own (with some obvious re-working) might have made a wonderful self-contained short story.  I just wish that Gaiman had found a way to string these events together in a unifying manner.  Out of nowhere, you find Shadow talking to Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, on an old black-and-white TV.  Or, apropos of nothing, Gaiman's narrator barges in to admit to the fictionality of the story he is telling:  &quot;None of this can actually be happening.  If it makes you more comfortable, you could simply think of it as a metaphor.&quot;  These are all great bits of writing, but they don't fittogether to make a cohesive whole.<br />&quot;American Gods&quot;, for me, is a very frustrating read, for just these reasons.  It has boundless potential, but at every turn Gaiman fails to reach the high levels he's aiming for.  It makes for a powerful work, one that's often boring, at times quite frustrating, but in moments quite exhilarating.  At nearly 600 pages, anything is going to be hit or miss.  I was just hoping for a few more hits from Gaiman, a writer I've admired in the past.  I admire him here, too.  I just didn't enjoy him that much.together to make a cohesive whole.<br />&quot;American Gods&quot;, for me, is a very frustrating read, for just these reasons.

B00006690F|5.0|EMINEM IS BACK AGAIN! And he wants you to hear what he feels about many or the world's problems today!  From Chandra Levy to the war on Terrorism all the way to Dick Cheney, Eminem has something to say.  I am a big fan of Eminem no matter what the media says about him.  I really enjoyed his last two albums: The Slim Shady and Marshall Mathers LP.  Two of my favorites are '97 Bonnie & Clyde and The Way I Am.  It was a shame that The Eminem Show was pirated and released on the internet before it was released.  I found a couple of songs on Kazaa but that did not mean I was not going to get this CD.  I had to have it, because I just don't know any other rapper that makes me laugh thru rapping like Eminem does.  Eazy E and Eminem have one thing in common...they make you laugh as you jam to the music.  That is probably why I like Eminem's music soo much because I am already feeling good with his hard hitting tracks and he makes me laugh.  If you are big fan of Eminem, they you MUST have this CD.  If you are not a fan of Eminem, don't even come near this CD and don't playahate this CD.  I talk about the songs below, not the skits.<BR><br /><BR>1.White America - Good Rock-Rap song about a Govt dominated by White people.  Very funny.<BR>2.Business - Eminem disses rap criminals. Does this song rock>?  Dr. Dre says Hell Yeah!<BR>3.Cleanin Out My Closet - Very serious song where Eminem finally has the last laugh at his mom's expense.<BR>4.Square Dance - Good song where Eminem wants you to get loose and get down to this jam.<BR>5.Soldier - Great song that pretty much explains how Eminem will keep on coming no matter how hard you beat him down.<BR>6.Say Goodbye Hollywood - Another good song where Eminem realizes that he must change his dangerous ways to secure his future for himself and Hallie.<BR>7.Drips - LOL! Eminem and his crew preach about how everyone needs to practice safe sex now!<BR>8.Without Me - You should already know this song is a hit.<BR>9.Sing for the Moment - Eminem raps about coming up from nothing to making it big.  This song samples Steve Tyler's \\"Dream On\\".<BR>10.Superman - Eminem can be your Superman...good song.<BR>11.Hailie's Song - Eminem's daughter really helps Enimem keep it together in his crazy world.  Nice song.<BR>12.When the music stops - Funny song that points out that you should never do what rappers preach about in thier music...<BR>13.Eminem and Dr. Dre showcase on this song and that people need to stand behind what they say or they should just shut up.  It's funny...Dr. Dre is the one and only. <BR>14.Till I Collapse - Eminem won't stop rapping till he dies...good song.  Nice beat but weird background vocal.<BR>15.My Dad's Gone Crazy - Excellent! Crazy! Song! And it stars Hailie!  You have to hear it...I hope she stars in other songs in the future...<BR><br /><BR>What are you doing still reading this?  Order this CD NOW!
B000005Z0E|3.0|This album simply suffers from poor production, plain and simple that is the problem with \\"2Pacalypse Now\\".  2Pac's lyrics are at his finest coming at listeners from all angles (politically, racially and partying).  This album is a must have for hard core hip hop fans, your collection would be empty without this LP.  Highlights appear on the lead single \\"Trapped\\" and \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\".
B00005NW02|5.0|This CD is simply awesome. There isn't a single song that I skip when I listen to it. Solid, heavy guitar riffs with good bass and drums add to the voices that can hit just about every note humanly possible. High notes, low notes, fast music, slow music, everything song makes me want to jump around. Both CDs are definately worth buying and a must-have in my opinion.
B00005AQGH|5.0|It must be hard for Tupac Amaru Shakur to make music that is not amazing.  This album was to be the beginning of a new era in music (Makaveli Records), instead it ended up being the beginning of another era (the first of several post-humurous LP's).  I would place this as the second greatest album in hip hop history (behind 2Pac's &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;).  This album is amazing Pac is spitting venom from the pit of this stomach, attacking his enemies like never before, lyrically lynching MC's such as Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Puff Daddy, Mobb Deep and even Nas gets caught in the cross-fire.  There will never be another 2Pac and there will never be another album like this.
0553212737|5.0|This was the second of Austen's books I had read, The first being 'Pride and Prejudice'.  This book (Emma) is deffinantly one of my favorite.  Still, I think if you are considering reading your first Jane Austen I reccomend Pride and Prejudice, it's a little more acssesable.  after you have finished Emma watch version with Gwenath Pultrow film of it it is much better than the BBC version. still read this book!  Even if you read slowly your time will never regret it!
B000005Z0G|3.0|Tupac Amaru Shakur immediatly come out swinging with \\"Holler If Your Hear Me\\", with it's riot-inciting lyrics it perfectly sets the tone for what is to come on \\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\\".  This album is loaded with hot tracks like: \\"Last Wordz\\" (feat. Ice Cube and Ice-T), \\"Souljah's Revenge\\", \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" and \\"I Get Around\\".  At point in Pac's career this was the best album of two album career, but this album is nothing but a HINT of what was two come in his following LP's.  This is another must have in your music collection.
B00003CX8J|5.0|X-Men, like Spider-Man, has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. In the near future, humans evolve, or mutate, and attain special powers. But, because of this, un-mutated humans fear them, and thus, some mutants revolt aganist them, causing chaos with their powers. Luckily, not all mutants use their powers for revenge. They understand why the humans fear them and help them, even if the humans don't accept it. One day, a man named Logan was using his secret mutant powers to win a wrestling match at a bar. He left the bar because the humans found out about his powers, and another mutant secretly hitched a ride in the back of his pick-up truck. Well, he got ambushed, the X-Men saved him, they worked together, they beat the bad guy. Simple, no?<br />This movie's special effects and action sequences are amazing. It's fun to watch, even if you've seen it a million times, and the bonus features add even more watching time. Hope there's gonna be a sequel to Spidey, too.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Without a doubt in my mind this is the greatest (hip hop) album of all-time from the greatest MC of all time.  This album has it all intense and meaningful lyrics, heart-pounding beats, catchy-soulful hooks and great collaborations.  Every record on this is either perfect or damn-near perfect, nobody makes music like this anymore.  Listening to this album will depress you knowing that Tupac Shakur is no longer here to follow up this classic album, but he spirit lives on within his last LP released (while he was still alive and had full imput on a project).  Rest In Peace Mr. Shakur we miss you more than you could ever imagine.
B00003CXI1|5.0|If you compare it to the book you're making a mistake.  In order to do the book justice the film would be 5 hours long!  With that in mind, can this 2 1/5 hour film due justice to this highly anticipated film?  The answer is a resounding yes.  Tickets sales proved that. Of course knowing the book, the viewer understands and appreciates more of the movie.  Having read the book, you subconsciously fill in the blanks.  For those who haven't read the book, the film does a good job carrying the story as reasonable as possible.  It's no different than reading a Steven King or Clancy novel and expecting the film to be as detailed.  Give credit where credit is due.  This film is excellent top to bottom and we're all looking forward to the next installment!  This is a great film for the family to enjoy.
B00000055E|2.0|Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9, only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 (Heaven).  This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac's early work, most tracks were made around the times of \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" and \\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\\", and it shows.  Although Tupac (as always) comes with it lyrically (for the most part), this album - like his old albums, suffers from poor production.  But this LP is still a solid buy, it is just below average overall as an LP.  Records like \\"Do 4 Me\\" and \\"I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto (remix)\\", alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album.
B00005OCMR|4.0|'Tron' is one of those films from the past that really never got a fair shot at the box office, but has cleaned up on video and now looks better than ever on DVD.  A real departure for Disney in 1982, 'Tron' is the story of Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is a former employee of ENCOM.  (Sounds a little like ENRON?  Sorry, that's another story that's still being written.)  ENCOM's CEO (David Warner) has pirated Flynn's video game software, leaving Flynn out in the cold.  But Flynn has an idea:  If he can get into ENCOM's Master Control Program, he may be able to make a few changes and receive the credit he deserves.  But things take a surprising turn when Flynn finds himself actually inside the computer system fighting for his life.  <br />The story is simple and is really quite secondary to the great visual effects.  Although film visuals have made many exciting advances in the last 20 years, no other film has captured the look of 'Tron.'  It continues to stand alone.  If you've never seen it, by all means, do yourself a favor and watch what I believe will be a pleasant surprise for you.  You'll watch the film in amazement, thinking, \\"Was this REALLY made in the primitive 80's?\\"

0767903862|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and what can I say. I thought it was fantastic. Bill Bryson not only talkes about his interaction with Aussies, but also gives some history about the different parts of Australia that he travels to. He continues by giving some dates, names, and stories so the reader could have a better understanding as to why a town, city, desert, or what have you, is the way it is. Some of the stories he tells are extremely funny. I knew some facts about Australia, but after reading this book I definitely have a better grasp of the country. It was very informative and entertaining.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is a brave movie, and for me, it struck VERY close to home (as you'll see below). What might at first seem like playful pretentions - the animation, the intense monologues connected by lethargic ramblings - actually turn out to be not just artifice but ART. And I capitalize the word ART intentionally. And what I mean by ART is this: its gimmicks, its obtuseness, its force, its visual and verbal games all turn out to be valuable and significant symbols. It is animated for a reason. It is alternately ambling and in your face for a reason. It is mercurial and personal and universal for a reason. And as with all good art, they are good reasons. &quot;Waking Life&quot; poignantly explores useful and ingenious perspectives of how we perceive the world both personally and impersonally, feeling at once fully aware and half asleep, sometimes engaged and sometimes apathetic, trying to make sense of what others think makes sense to them. This theme is central to the film, I think, and it is profound: how do we make sense of what others think makes sense to them?<br />Let me pose that question again: how do we make sense of what others think makes sense to them? What makes sense objectively? And what keeps us feeling sporadically nonsensical and thus alone in our thoughts, whether or not we're asleep or awake? How are we together? And how are we alone?<br />Like Linklater, I spent lots of years in central Austin. I saw &quot;Slacker&quot; when it came out and realized I was surrounded, at the corner of 15th and Nueces, by places where that radically quirky movie had been filmed. Also like Linklater, I immersed myself in the intellectual riches of UT, the University of Texas, that bastion of not-so-ivory towers that grows at the northern end of Linklater's cinematic neighborhood. (Indeed, I could swear that he used my bare-board duplex with the white French doors and that white swinging door for the interiors of the protagonist's home in Waking Life. What a STRANGE sense ofdeja vu /'am I dreaming' THAT sent through me!) The point is, I feel Linklater has successfully captured that central Austin milieu successfully, in its tawdry and brainy extremes, outwardly and in my mind... How am I connected to you? How am I alone?<br />And onto that milieu, Linklater has added a rich tapestry of the profound themes I mentioned above. (A cross between &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; and &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;?) That all those words can wear you out means it's worth a few go 'rounds at least.<br />I happened to see the VHS version of this film. But it is the kind of film that immediately makes a curious or enthusiastic (or mystified) viewer want to hear what the director and production staff have to say. It is, like &quot;What Dreams May Come?&quot;, &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, a film where behind-the-scenes explorations of screenplay development, technique and production decisions prove fascinating. So I'm getting the DVD to have access to all of that additional material. It will be worth it, as I plan to encourage my friends and movie/idea loving acquaintances to see and think about the artistry that is &quot;Waking Life.&quot;
0767903862|5.0|In A Sunburned Country was a very informative and entertaining book.  Bill Bryson has a very witty and sometimes cynical sense of humor. He uses that to convey his thoughts about the people and places of Australia.  He also has a very deep understanding of the history of one of the oldest countries in the world.  I was able to grasp a better knowledge and understanding of this distant country.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about this unique land.

0425107469|5.0|This is most definitely Dean Koontz's best book I've ever read! The way he has one dog being the hero and one being the enemy is different and surprising.  The dogs are in place of a human and play the human job.  You get more involved with the smart dog, Einstein, who is even more loving and smart than some humans. The dogs are examples of humans advanced technology, which can turn out worse or better than ever imagined.  There is another creature that was created, the Outsider, who is the total opposite of Einstein in personality.  Although he is just as smart, he is full of anger and jealousy, and is willing to destroy anything in his path to get to Einstein.<br />The dogs are experiments from government labs that went extremely well and at the same time, very wrong.  Both of the dogs were as smart as intended to be, although one did not posses the looks and kindness of the other. Einstein had it all, while the Outsider grew to hate Einstein more and more everyday. The Outsider knew how ugly and disliked he was, and this caused him to want to destroy Einstein more than anything did. <br />Einstein did more than the creators even thought he would do. He could sense things normal animals or people could not. Bringing people together was normal and easy for him. The Outsider despised these qualities for he did not possess them.<br />Even if you do not enjoy reading, this book is almost impossible to put down. It has non-stop suspense and before you know it, you are almost done with the book.  The way Dean Koontz constantly has a piece of knowledge hidden makes the reader keep reading until the answer is discovered. Reading this book is only a positive experience for there are many messages about life.  Read this book and you will be inspired! It's an awesome read, and will not bore you from the very start!
B00003CXI1|3.0|While I still utterly adore this movie (which certainly is 4 stars or more), I think there are some issues with DVD that deserve mention.<br />The quality of the transfer is obviously good and I am very happy to see that most are now being made with WIDESCREEN as the default format.  However, the &quot;extras&quot; included seemed painfully scant from a release with this much anticipation. A good deal of content is rehashed of the web content. If you visited the site at least once (which I imagine many fans have), you've seen much of the DV-ROM section.<br />Secondly there is no easy way to access the additional footage.  It was mildly charming to initially plod through the &quot;game&quot; to find hidden footage, but not so much so if you wanted to view it a second time. Other than the interview with Chris Columbus (director) and the producer of the film, there are not many other things to hold the attention of an adult. Particularly annoying is the lack of a director's commentary. And while there IS a book in the library containing Quidditch pre-production art, there is little else.<br />Finally, while this is a very minor point, the DVD is boxed in such a way that it JUTS out from my shelf. I am sure that is a clever marketing ploy, but from a collector with nearly 200 DVDs, I find it a little troublesome.<br />BUT... buy the DVD anyway. Its a great film and franchise! :)

B00001ODHJ|3.0|When this film was released, I found that it strayed so far from the original story that it was almost distracting. Still, there was something compelling about it and I find myself returning for repeated viewings every now and then.  The humour is over the top and best enjoyed while under the influence a couple of drinks.  Bruce Campbell is fantastic and the effects are cheesy enough for some good laughs.  Non stop action!  Put yourself in the right frame of mind and there is fun to be had!
B00006690F|1.0|This album sounds exactly like the last one he released, which wasn't very good to begin with!  There's not one original song on the whole CD, they all have the same beats and the same boring lyrics.  The only worthy Eminem tracks that have come out since his first album are on other artist's CDs or on compilations, but as for his own LPs, they're utter garbage!  Sorry Eminem, but enough of the \\"rapping to angry white kids\\" nonsense.  Let's produce some quality raps here.
6305546789|5.0|This was the DVD that convinced me to buy a DVD player.  To see this film digitally restored was breathtaking.  Details I had never noticed before constantly jumped from the screen.  And of course, the film itself is one of the best that the horror genre has to offer.  One of the greatest strengths of this movie is that it manages to capture the creepy atmosphere of the Halloween season through subtle lighting and music.  Scream is a pale imitation of this excellent thrill ride.
0201633612|5.0|If you want to progress from the quick and dirty hacker/programmer to full out designer/architect then this book is a must read.  Even though the examples may not be in a language that you work in there is no question that this book presents solid coding practices and examples that can be translated easily into any OO language.  I have not seen a technical book in a long time that has shown this level of longevity.  <br />Technology and software is a very dynamic field.  Things change quickly and trends form.  Some stay, some go.  However, solid principles, patterns and designs have shown to last throughout.  These principles last beyond the technology in which they were introduced.  <br />The patterns introduced in this book represent a structured way to organize the reocurring problems in OO software development.  The patterns can help lead to code that is structured, reusable and organized.

B00006690F|5.0|There'll be a matter of time before we start to see negative reviews, so I'll spread my positive input now. THE EMINEM SHOW, is without a doubt, the best album thus far this year. It's right there with NAS's STILLMATIC. I've been listening to the whole album, and I've yet to find a track I didn't like. The playful lyrics and crackshots from his previous album have been thrown. This is a new Eminem so to speak. His lyrics are more personal and politcal than ever. Its just too much to say about how good this album is.<br />FAVORITE TRACKS: WHITE AMERICA, BUSINESS, CLEANING OUT MY CLOSET, SING FOR THE MOMENT, SUPERMAN, DRIPS, SAY WHAT YOU SAY, TILL I COLLAPSE.
0440219078|3.0|The book \\" The Giver \\" written by Lois Lowry is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community where everything is controlled by the government. He´s chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. He starts to have doubts about the system and finally tries to escape.<br />It´s a very imaginative book but sometimes it looses the connection to reality. It is a bit predictable, because you can imagine what the end will be like when you´ve read the first chapters.
B000002VQQ|5.0|This is an Album that grows on you like no other. The first time that you take a listen, if you're not a rock fan, you problably not like the sound in it. But the sound of &quot;Horses&quot; is so intense, so dramatic, so beautiful that you'll find yourself saying &quot;this is one of the best records I've ever listen...&quot;. I'm a rock fan. In my collection I have 536 cds and Patti Smiths &quot;Horses&quot; is, without a doubt, in my &quot;top 20&quot;. <BR>P.S.: Very similar (but obviously better) to PJ Harvey...
B000050FEN|1.0|For the entirety of this movie, the viewer is pulled down into the bleakest depths, dragged through the darkest corners of a most pitiless, murderous mind, and there -- as the closing credits roll -- we are left. Which is the most unworthy thing a filmmaker can do. I was genuinely outraged by \\"Seven\\", not because of its sadistic violence, but because it could find no cause to transform that violence into some kind of redeeming moment. In \\"Seven\\", the filmmakers do the easiest thing possible: create a fiendish murderer who kills in the most gruesome ways imaginable. That's EASY. A truly good film would have taken that premise and done something creative with it; fashioned a story that would have released the audience from its unrelentingly bleak grip with an ennobling insight, event, word, moment ... anything. As it is, this movie only seems intent on sucking the viewer as far as possible into the abyss. There's nothing remarkable about an achievement like that. In \\"Poetics,\\" Aristotle discusses \\"catharsis\\" in Greek tragedy as something owed the audience by the playwright. A drama may steep an audience in cruel travail, but to be truly successful as art, the work must purge those intense audience emotions -- bring \\"catharsis\\" to the events of the drama. There is no catharsis in this movie. The only reaction left to us is anger for being so manipulated by the filmmakers. <br />And it is a shame, because I thought  at one point this movie had the potential for greatness (the cinematography is magnificent), difficult as it was watching and as contrived as the plotline is. Because, of course, I expected a worthy director, a worthy writer, would finally take this dark vision and transform it into light, even if just a small hint of light. That doesn't happen. As viewers, we have been exploited ... and [taken advantage of]. This isn't art. This isn't good movie making. This is profiting in meanness.
B00000253N|5.0|Bob Dylan is an Icon of Universal music. \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is his best Album without a doubt. Tracks like \\"Simple Twist of Faith\\" or \\"Idiot Wind\\" are among the best songs ever writen. In my collection of 536 cd's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" ranks at number 3. Dont miss this gem to your collection. It is PERFECT!
8185300534|5.0|I INITIALLY viewed this book as non-specific, pointless, and rambling because it was not based on \\"axiomatic\\" thinking. After multiple readings, I am convinced that this is the most INTERNALLY CONSISTENT and USEFUL analysis that I have seen---Maharaj sits way up on top of the Mountain and his grand view sees things most of us simply do not. But, as you WORK through the book, you are inescapably drawn into agreement (although complete experience may only be an eventual goal) and see a slow change in (and your awareness of) your SELF. <br />The recent book \\"The Power of Now\\" (E. Tolle) is a \\"popularization\\" of this book's message. <br />I simply cannot recommed I AM THAT any more strongly. Don't give up if the inital going is difficult--eventually, its STUNNING SIMPLICITY comes through to pay rich dividends. You don't have to read the Gita or the Bible, Schopenhauer, Koran or Russell, or any one else for that matter, after this book.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is not only the best Pink Floyd album (in my opinion) but it spoke to me. A lot of those songs are exactly how i feel right now in my life. sometimes i feel like Roger is singing to me. Crazy, i know, but its how it makes me feel. I am not going to sit here and say this and this is a good song because you have to experience this monster as a whole, and if possible, before watchng the movie, because although the film is excellent, it spoils your imagination when listening to the album. get your own vision of the music first and then perhaps watch the film (i recommend it too!!). and don't listen to those people who say Dark Side of the Moon is the best album... they overlooked a colossal masterpiece.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is awesome kick ... action, this is one of the best DVDs there is. I would also strongly suggest Die Hard on DVD. T2 is way better than the sequel, James Cameron is a mastermind. The action is there no romance bull, just 2 hours and 40 minutes of wall to wall action! Arnold on a Harley, then kicking T1000 models ... at the end. GET THIS MOVIE!

0783225792|5.0|&quot;Casino&quot; falls short of Scorcese's classics like &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; and &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; and it covers too familiar ground (another mob movie?  De Niro and Pesci again?).  Nonetheless, it's an irrestistible glimpse at the mob scene in Vegas, and it's chock full of stellar performances.  If Joe Pesci deserved an Oscar for his role in &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; then he should have deserved two for &quot;Casino,&quot; where he's in even better form.  DeNiro also shines in his role as Rothstein, looking dapper in his flawlessly-tailored suits.  But the film's revelation is Sharon Stone, who radiates as De Niro's love.  She was rightfully nominated for an Oscar, but, to this day, she has never since had a role worth our while as this.  Scorcese snobs will roll their eyes and call this film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;-lite, but, at nearly 3 hours, it's good enough to glue your eyes to the screen.

B00005JKG7|5.0|A group of mariners, with leprosy, are tricked into steering their ship into the rocks killing all on board. One hundred years later (to the day) John Houseman is telling a story to a group of children around the campfire. That same night, as the clock strikes midnight, a number of strange events take place on the sleeping town. The local priest, Hal Holbrook, find the diary of his grandfather who, took part in the death of the mariners 100 years ago. Adrienne Barbeau owns the local radio station, Janet Leigh is the chairperson for the town's 100-year celebration, and Jamie Lee Curtis is a visitor just hitchhiking through town.<br />Throughout the movie we see the Fog roll in and out, move against the wind, produce an old ship, and of course the mariners from 100 years ago.<br />If you like suspenseful movies, you won't be disappointed with this one. I glad to see it come out on DVD.

B00003CXI1|5.0|I'm a working mother, I do a lot of volunteer work, I spend quality and quantity time with my kids, and I simply do not have the time to play games (literally!) to find the missing scenes.  Those, frankly, are the only reason I bought the CD, and it is extremely irksome to me (who stayed up til 1:45 a.m. working last night) that I can't simply view the scenes I bought and thought I had immediate access to.  There should be a work-around for the many adult fans who actually have busy lives.  This isn't a Sesame Street movie aimed only at toddlers, and I think the producers ought to have taken the sophistication of its audience into account in designing the special features of the CD.  (It is also very annoying to have the Privet St. sign sail in and take up time every time you are, as I was, searching through the CDs for the missing scenes.)

If you are new to the Moodies, you will find this album to be one of their best.  If you like this album, you may also enjoy &quot;To All Our Children's Children's Children,&quot; &quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot; and &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.&quot;  Each of these is similarly experimental, with varying degrees of success.<br />Regardless of your feelings toward this album, it helped defined progressive rock as a genre with the few other progressive rock groups of the late 60s and early 70s, and will always hold a special place for those who looked for the next evolution of rock music.
B000053GTK|5.0|took me a month to comprehend it all, but after that I could not stop listening to it for another month. It's so good I can't say which track is my favorite, honestly. I would say In A Glass House/ Experience/ Way Of Life (I mean the studio work not the bonus live tracks. Not that they are bad, I like the studio ones better). Just try to follow the turns and twists of their musical thought and you will be bewildered how a human could produce something like that. It's the pinnacle of their musical complexity, absolute masterpiece, brilliance at its best, strange that it was not released in the US. (Just looked at a review below, Inmate's Lullaby demonstrates the complexity of their musical thinking better than any other piece of this album, what matters here is not what they do but how they do it)
B00003CXI1|3.0|The movie is great!  I really enjoyed it, in fact, now that I have seen it a couple of times, I love it!  I was really excitied for the special features on Disc two.<BR>  <BR>  Well, There isn't much to get excitied about.  There is only one portion that actually lets you see interviews with the Director and scriptwriter and such.  Its only about 15 min and during that time, is when one can see behind the scenes.  I was hoping for J.K. Rowling to have something to say, or any of the cast members.  There is no commentary, no outakes, and only 10 minutes of deleted scenes.  <BR>  <BR>  To get to the Deleted scenes on the second disc is fun, at first.  We get to see clips of the actual movie, and try to get to the stone.  It was fun, for the first fifteen mins.  I thought it was a bit much, just again, for only 10 minutes of deleted scenes.  I did like the design photos that you can find - not telling where they are though.  That was really cool.  <BR> <BR>  I am keeping in mind that this is desgined for Children.  For a grown up fan, its worth it, but maybe you want to get the one disk version.
B000006YYM|5.0|I got it at the same time as Free Hand which is as close to perfection as possible, but in the end I loved it more than Free Hand. All tracks are excellent, my favorites are Proclamation/Valedictory (basically the same melody) and Aspirations.
B00004R9A4|3.0|\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is a lot better than I remembered it being, though it is still far from perfect. I saw this as a child during its initial release in Radio City Music Hall. I didn't like it then because I thought it made fun of the Nazis (my dad was in World War II, so I always was taught the seriousness of the Nazi threat). Later, there used to be something called \\"Disney Summer Film Festival\\" where you had the opportunity to see many older Disney cartoons and movies (very important in a time before VCRs!), but the downside was everything I ever wanted to see was always accompanied by \\"BandB\\" as a double feature. We had to be certain to make sure we saw the preferred film first, so that if we wanted to  see it again, we only had to sit through \\"BandB\\" once. THAT's how much I and my brothers disliked this movie as children. <br />Only a few years back, I took it upon myself to rent \\"BandB\\" with my own money, to see if I still felt as strongly. Well, the passage of time does wonders, sometimes. <br />BEST PARTS: Hands down, its best special effects Oscar was well earned. Witch Angela Lansbury casts a spell to animate all the armor in an old weapons museum to combat the invading Nazi forces. Frankly, it is quite creepy to see the faceless helmets turn to regard their foes. The other part that especially pleases my now-adult tastes are the opening titles, which are done in the style of the Bayeux Tapestry. This is because the movie concerns itself with another threatened invasion of England, this time by the Nazis. At the end of the sequence, the image of a woman on a broomstick is worked in, to give a foretaste of Angela Lansbury's role.<br />WORST PARTS: \\"Mary Poppins\\" did an excellent job with two reluctant children. Now we have three--totally unnecessary. Also, these children are somewhat charmless. The movie is overly long at times. It had best not be compared to \\"Mary Poppins\\" because it will lose in every category, but most children's films would anyway.<br />Otherwise, \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is not as awful as it struck me years ago. Should do the trick for you.
B000002504|5.0|of their musical achievement which lasted for a few years and four more albums (I know zenith is a peak, cannot last, use any word you please). The Advent Of Panurge is a definite favorite, a masterpiece impossible not to like. As usual, you never know what to expect next after every single musical phrase. A perfect piece of jazz-rock. An incredible mastery of sound progressing from a beautiful vocal piano into a storm of seemingly cacophonic full-band forte. The references to Rabelais (dates back to Acquiring The Taste) attest to a multi-layered intellect, quite a rarity in rock. Also don't miss on Think Of Me With Kindness, it's easy to overlook. The first impression is that you've tuned to an easy-listening station so simple it seems, but the sudden twists of their musical thought make it an exceptional composition. Try to sing it along to appreciate the intricacies of the rhythmical swings. And the most unusual and totally unexpected ending (\\"Think of me with kindness, think of me...\\")
B000002PCS|5.0|Great music for a great movie.  I've listened to this for years and it never gets old.  Elegant piano and violin work... a &quot;must have&quot; cd for any fan of &quot;classic&quot; instrumentals.
B000001FW9|5.0|Classifying Gentle Giant as a Progressive Rock band is probably due to the fact that there was no other musical style in rock and no other genre in contemporary music in general they could be associated with. The word \\"experimental\\" fits it better, for one reason amongst others being the fact that they mixed different (sometimes incompatible by default) styles. This record is the best illustration of that. The House, The Street, The Room is excellent with its tuning orchestra dissonance and great lead guitar follow-up solo. Wreck would probably grab your ear with its melodic beauty and seeming simplicity, take notice of the little details like medieval flute and harpsichord. But in fact all compositions are very good. Their remarks about \\"blatant commercialism\\" are very appealing too. That was at the time when rock was at the crossroads of either turning into an art (after its most creative period of the late 60's) or continuing as a commercial money cow.
B000002UUX|5.0|A fine album, indeed. Pretty much every track, with the exception of \\"Dawn Patrol,\\" is a standout. The guitar solos on this disk are truly mindboggling - Marty Friedman gets the job done. These songs never get repetitive or boring, unlike Metallica. Amazing lyrics, and very good vocals from Mustaine. A masterpiece by the (once) great masters of speed metal. I was hooked on the first listen.
B0000024ZC|5.0|this one is one step ahead. As with the first two, all compositions are very good. I don't know why but I'm completely taken by Three Friends, the last one. It springs out of Mister Class And Quality (excellent too) and its beginning is not properly marked on the CD, it really begins at 2:27 into the track. Prologue is another good one to start with. School Days is the best track here. Its rhythmical equilibristics are dizzying. The fast part breaks the rhythm into the slow piano and beautiful vocals fading into another piano part, that in turn flows into a xylophone solo. In the end they return to the very line they begin with (the same approach is used in Experience from Glass House). Working All Day and Peel the Paint both have lots of the vocals sung in unison with the instrumental parts which presents the only weak point here, though both are very good.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for Destruction is one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through without cringing.  Basically, this is a collection of great hard rock songs mixed in with several timeless classics.  Amazing songwriting, tons of energy, and shredding guitar work by Slash does a great album make.  Several songs, such as &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; and &quot;Out to Get Me&quot; have great tempo changes that leave you breathless.  Buy it now.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This is definitely Pearl Jam's masterpiece.  It's their darkest, scariest, and most artistic work to date.  Released in the wake of the tragic death of Kurt Cobain, \\"Vitalogy\\" just drips with angst.  It's almost overpowering.  This album contains some of their heaviest, most intense songs, such as \\"Whipping\\", \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", and \\"Satan's Bed\\".  You've also got some nice haunting ballads, like \\"Nothingman\\" and \\"Tremor Christ\\".  Lyrical topics cover everything from sex, to drugs, to abortion, and, most importantly, bugs.  <br />I think putting \\"Better Man\\" and \\"Corduroy\\" on here was kind of a bad move.  I mean, they're both great songs, but they're much more mainstream sounding than anything else on here, and they don't really seem to fit.  Plus, I don't doubt that many people bought this album purely based on those songs, and as a result were very disappointed.  I think they were better suited for \\"Versus\\", or even \\"No Code\\".<br />This album is meant to be experienced as a whole (like Tool's \\"Aenima\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\"), but my favorite moment would have to be \\"Immortality\\".  Haunting, beautiful album closer, an ambiguous tribute to Kurt.  However, I really don't like \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama That's Me\\".  7 minutes of pure noise.  I won't let it bring the album down (since it's at the end), but it's hard to overlook.  For me, the album's over at \\"Immortality\\".  I don't mind the other \\"noise\\" tracks, though.  \\"Aye Davanita\\" is really cool, \\"Pry To\\" isn't even enough to amount to anything, and \\"Bugs\\" is just hilarious (who says Eddie Vedder has no sense of humour?).<br />This is definitely not for a sunny day, but I could not be happier that I bought this.  If you love dark, artistic music, this is definitely for you. You should also get Tool's \\"Aenima\\" and Cold's debut.  Pearl Jam will never be like this again.  Maybe that's a good thing, but at least they were long enough to make this gem.
B000002H33|5.0|\\"Master of Puppets\\" is a thrash metal classic. This is speed and energy that blows most of their competitors out of the water. James Hetfield has a biting voice that grips you from start to finish. Lars' drumming is like machine gun fire - check out his work on \\"Disposable Heroes\\". The band had an amazing bass player, Cliff Burton, who died in a bus crash shortly after the release of this album. The instrumental \\"Orion\\" is perhaps his finest hour. Amazing...<br />In my opinion, the first three songs aren't quite as strong as the rest. The title track gets a little repetitive at times, and \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" doesn't quite fit in, with its slower pace. But everything from \\"Sanitarium\\" to \\"Damage, Inc.\\" is metal madness at its best.
0671042858|5.0|I was done reading this book just as soon as I opened the cover. My friend recommened that I read the book because it was a \\"quick read,\\" but I didn't think it would go quite as quickly as it did. Stephen King really knows how to hold a reader's attention. The suspense was non-stop up until the end. I found myself worrying about the well being of this nine-year-old girl while I was suppose to be learning other topics at school. I've never been much of a fan of literature, but this book just might have turned me into a Stephen King fan. The usage of sports as a reason to stay alive was very refreshing. It made me realize that there's more to life than just money and careers; there's also entertainment. Life's simple pleasures can actually keep somebody alive. I loved the book and I recommend that everyone should read it.
B000062TU1|5.0|This is partly a response for the review about &quot;Good For Kids???&quot;  This movie and series of books is about imagination, expanding people (and kids) minds about lives different from their own.  By not allowing kids to see a movie like this is cheating them.  The world is not sugar coated and in these times, tolerance of those different from us is even more important.  Good parents would allow their children to see other points of view than their own (obviously within limits), so that they can raise well-rounded children with open minds.  Let Harry Potter live on!
0440539811|4.0|As one person said when they recommended this book &quot;It is bootcamp for the mind&quot;. It was a spiral of the strange and bizzar mixed with interesting factoids and grand illusions of super secret societies.  Nothing is what it seems and yet at the same time it is everything it appears on the surface.  I was facinated till the end.  I recommened this book to all who are looking for something outside of the normal.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I find it hard to believe that so many people are so quick to judge and condemn the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.  Upon emerging as a book (not just for kids but for the kid in all of us), it got children to turn off their video games and READ!!!  It was amazing that a children's book would hold the best seller lists for months.  Public schools as well as Colleges around the country have added the entire series to their curricula.  Most nay-sayers would point that the stories teach about and glorify witchcraft and wizardry.  May I point to a classic which was written a century ago and made into a movie that has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time????  The Wizard of Oz is all about a fantastic land full of witches, wizards, and other strange magical qualities....Another example was written over 50 years ago by a devout Christian.  C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" contains as much magic, witches, and other strange phenomena as Harry Potter.  People are so quick to judge and condemn that they are too blind to see what lies at the heart of the work.<br />As for the movie itself, it is amazing how faithful it is to Rowling's first novel.  The acting is phenomenal especially among the three children (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson).  Miss Watson is so bossy and perfect that I actually believed that she was Hermione.  The supporting cast is full of British acting royalty.  Maggie Smith is fantastic as Pro McGonagall.  Richard Harris is wise and learned as Dumbledore.  Robbie Coltrane is hillarious as the gentle, often muddled Hagrid.<br />I absolutely loved the Quidditch match.  The whole movie just zipped along almost making me forget that it is over 2 and a half hours long<br />Now for the heart of the matter.  At the conclusion of the movie, Ron and Hermione are both awarded for standing along side of their friend in the face of danger.  Harry himself is awarded for ultimate bravery and courage.  Even poor Neville Longbottom is awarded for standing up to his friends when what they are doing is against the rules because it is dangerous.  Is this not what people wish small chiildren to carry with them?  It is a shame that anyone would wish to condemn this wonderful cultural phenomenon.  Bravo to Ms. Rowling who created this wondeful world in an attempt to provide a better life for her children as a single mother!!!  Eagerly awaiting Year Two at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry:  Harry Potter and the Chamberr of Secrets.\\"
B0000028VT|5.0|Only few artists have accomplished what Mariah has during the last decade. She's sold 150 million albums, earned 15 #1 smash hits, all of which are hugely popular and was chosen as Artist Of The Decade. Now that's what I call a legendary singer! Anyway, Music Box is one of her first recordings. I bought this album after hearing \\"Dreamlover\\" on the radio. It was a HUGE hit back then, and then when I discovered \\"Hero\\" and \\"Without You\\" I knew this was it! It's my favorite album of Mariah. Although I really liked Mariah's old image of the-girl-next-door I think the dramatic change was a necessary move. I mean, how long can she stick to that same 'ol image?! All in all, one of the best releases of the 90s.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have watchrd this movie three times and each time I see something new!!! The first time, I noticed the eye-catching Thanksgiving dinner where everyone comes together at Peter and Harry's apartment.  Eye-catching for the choice of attire in Peter and Norman Osborn.  Norman ironically wore a blue shirt with a red tie.  After Peter rushed in, after nearly being caught by the villain, he appeared in a green dress shirt with dark green tie.  How cool is that!!!<BR>The second time through, I caught a glimpse of Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee himself.  In specials highlighting the films release, the audience was promised a cameo; however, the appearance eluded me the first time.  The second time, I thought  I glimpsed him.  But, on the third viewing, I saw him save a young girl during the World Unity Celebration in Times Square.  It reminded me of the ET sightings in Episode I.  I have yet to see that even with DVD.<BR>I eagerly wish for a Christmas DVD release of this epic masterpiece with lots of extras
B000002672|5.0|Owning every album Accept has ever played on, (including the ever-elusive Kaizoku Ban) I believe I can offer intelligent and logical insight on this album.<BR>1. This album is not like Balls to the Wall or Metal Heart. It's more like Breaker or Restless and Wild, with killer gang vocals<BR>2. This album is not glam or pop! I cannot understand how some reviewers are claiming that Russian Roulette is weaker than Balls to the Wall or Metal Heart. On the contrary, Balls and Metal are the Accept pop metal albums, with weak guitar, no gang vocals, and tiny-sounding electronic drums. Russian Roulette, from the thunderous double-bass onslaught of TV War to the workout Teutonic metal of Stand Tight, delivers with every song! No pop metal here, just superb melodic minor heavy metal with melancholy vocals of Udo Dirkschneider.
B000067D8W|5.0|This disc containing the first 2 episodes of the series have been combined to play as a movie length episode which follows how it was played on television as a repeat. The advantages of watching this exclusive Canadian import - where the series is filmed - are the extra features and the pleasure of being able to watch it over and over without degradation. I'm interested in hearing the audio commentaries and would really like to see some outtakes or deleted scenes on the disc.<br />The fact that this DVD has come out so soon after the show first aired is something in itself, since the first season has only just finished airing on TV.<br />The cool thing about the show are the great special effects which are in ample supply in about every episode and the very likeable young cast. The first of which I had seen of 2 of it's cast members - Tom Welling (Clark Kent) and Kristen Kreuk (Lana Lang). Michael Rosenbaum is also great as Lex Luthor. The Theme song \\"Save Me\\" by Remy Zero is also a great choice for such a show as Clark ends up saving at least 1 person in each episode.<br />After watching this movie it will be easy to get hooked to the show. One stand-out scene in particular involves the meteor shower at the start. All-in-all I think the mix of drama, humour, special effects and the great looking cast all combine to make this show one that will appeal to all age groups.<br />I'll be looking forward to when they have the whole series on DVD as I'll be one of the first people to buy it...
B00001QEFU|1.0|The original 1982 \\"Secret Records\\" mix of Under the Blade was Twisted Sister's best record.  This one, the 1985 \\"Atlantic Records Remaster,\\" is the worst.<br />I am not a snob--I really feel that the new mix detracts just that much from the songs and the overall quality of the album.<br />1982 Original Mix:  Drum-and Bass-oriented.  A very heavy, punky, fast metal pop album<br />1985 Mix:  Guitar and Vocal-oriented, \\"glammy\\" mix.  Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with a glammy mix as long as this is how an album was recorded.  However, Under the Blade was a punk attitude album.  With the guitar and vocals levels increased to biblical proprtions, and drums and bass whittled down in the mix, the guitar sounds crappy, the vocals weak, etc.<br />Avoid this one and seek out the original, from 1982, either on Secret or Roadrunner records.  Avoid the Atlantic / Spitfire re-release.  Even the cover is different, \\"glammy\\" on this one.
0671027573|4.0|Four ladies who work together get together each week to socialize with each other.On a particular evening,the group eventurally comes up with a list that describes \\"The Perfect Man\\".The list consist of 4 or 5 characteristics that most women would agree with;such as,honesty,loyalty,caring,etc.Descriptions of the male anatomy,including male sexual body parts are added to the list. The women had no motive except to have some fun and the list was never meant to leave the group.The list leaks out and it is published in the newspaper.<br />\\"The List\\",as it became known,offended some men and they expressed their thoughts and feelings about what it said and meant.Some men found the list funny and did not take it seriously.But,a guy named Corin,took the list as offensive and disturbing.He is psychotic due to abuse by his mother when Corin was a child.Corin believes his mother will be very pleased with him (he will be \\"her perfect little boy\\")...The relationship between each of the ladies and their significant others in their private life are described throughout the book.The dept of each relationship is developed as the story is told causing the reader to feel as if that person is real.<br />I really loved the plot of the book,the characters,the mystery and the surprise ending.I would have given a rating of 5 except for one reason.I like a book that leaves some of the sexual acts to the reader's imagination and is not as graffic as some of the scenes in this book.Call me a prude,but I come from the old school.Always leave a little to the imagination.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I'm far from being a Jazz specialist, so I'm not going to try to categorise \\"Come away with me\\". I hear Jazz/Blues (\\"Cold cold heart\\", \\"Turn me on\\", \\"One flight down\\", the title track) and Folk/Country (\\"Lonestar\\", \\"Shoot the moon\\"). Norah Jones has a beautiful voice, natural, often sensual, a little bit smoky but not too much. I loved the arrangements, with a lot of piano, acoustic guitar and a soft rhythmic section. I guess some people will find the album too down tempo but I enjoyed it. Both arrangements and vocals are soothing.  In a word, it did click with me.<br />The slightly more upbeat and folk \\"Feelin' the same way\\" and the mesmerising \\"I've got to see you again\\" would be my favourite picks, but I never skip a track. I would consider purchasing her next recording. If you like Cassandra Wilson, give Norah a try.
B00006690F|5.0|This Cd was so nice.  It just got better and better as I listened to the Cd (5 times over, so far).  In my opinion, this is Em's most personal work yet, with introspective thoughts of his daughter, a concrete and solid end to his troubled relationships with both his mom and ex-girlfriend, and his thoughts on the Mid. East crisis and satire directed at Osama ...  It's a learning experience but, at the same time, it's hilarious.  I recommend it to everyone who like Em and his humerous \\"ways\\".
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie was great!! Okay, I admit that to me it was a bit boring because I have read the books and I already knew what was gonna happen. This movie shoud be seen by people who haven't read the books, because you'll enjoy it much more and it'll be more exiting. But I bought the DVD and I loved it! It took me a while to find the deleted scenes and I think that they woud have looked very good in the movie, but then again, it woud have been WAY too long. Anyway, I loved the movie and to those people who think this movie is not for kids, it is. I think that you need to imaginate and this movie makes you imaginate. And besides, in case you haven't noticed, the rating's PG, not R!!!
B00006690G|5.0|I am not obsessed with rap or Eminem, but this is really, really good! I would recommend this to anyone who as ever has the slightest interest in rap. It's very good. The lyrics are very well thought out and it is very deep. I hope you buy it because you will love it!
B00006690F|5.0|I am a big Eminem fan, and this CD is by far his best yet, the songs have more of a message in them, and it shows his range as a rapper.  The song \\"Sing for the moment\\" is probably his best song he has ever written.  The message is to the parents and tells them what he and the rest of the rappers actually do for fans.  Even if you don't like Eminem I suggest you at least listen to this CD.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spear's newest album, 'Britney' is faboo! Each album that is produced for her gets better. From bubblegum to this album proclaiming, \\"I'm a grown up\\" now, Brit is carrying it all. 'I'm a Slave 4 U', her first single says she will do anything for you so long as it is dancing, it is a great, sexy sounding song. Kind of like a Neptunes inspired techy, dancy tune, definetly a song people can get up and dance to. 'Overprotected' is my fave song; with its lyrics and strong beats, it should be a single in no time. <BR>I like how she emulates her 'heros' in some of the songs including 'Boys' (like Janet Jackson's 'Nasty') and her whispering in I'm a Slave 4 U. The disco beat on 'Anticipating'. Inspired.<BR>Her compilation with on/off again boyfriend Justin was great. The lyrics are genuine since they both know what it is like to be them - that is, in the spot light and under the spot light scrutiny all the time. <BR>Britney is now a writer for her CDs, on this record they include: 'Lonely', 'Anticipating', 'Cinderella', and more. Her lyrics are authentic and speak of what she is thinking. To be an authentic song writer is important, drawing in your old fans and new ones.
0743420373|4.0|I found this book to be very enlightening. I like how it shows you the true millionaire (as opposed to affluent people who spend too much money and will never become millionaires) because you can begin to figure out vicariously what you yourself can do to work toward becoming a millionaire.  I glanced over some of the reviews of those people who only gave it two or three stars and said, \\"...it talks about saving your money and not being extravagant. That's common sense.\\" They either didn't bother to mention a major point or else they missed it completely: all the millionaires mentioned were business owners (or self-employed). That's what it takes to reach their level. Even in comparing this book to Robert Kiyosaki's \\"Cash Flow Quadrant\\" you can see that striking similarity.  I remember when this book came out, the media put a lot of attention on the \\"wealthy defined\\" section: there's an equation on page 15 (which you can see right now since Amazon.com allows you to look through the pages on the net!) that is a major update to the old, out-dated wealth philosophy that you should be earning an equivalent to what your age is. This book really makes you look at your own car lust in a different way too! Do you really want that brand new high-priced current model year car that you have to pay for at least for the next 5 years (or even worse, lease it) or do you want to work toward making yourself wealthy right now?  And the section on \\"Weakening the weak and Strengthening the strong\\": I never had any idea that there were so many grown children (I'm talkin' in their 30's 40's & 50's) of affluent families consistently receiving large sums of money from their parents (for many years). What an eye opener!  I'm giving it 4 stars, though, because the preponderance of charts stunted the flow of my reading it.  At times the text became very pedantic in its explanation of a chart (which many times didn't seem to be of much importance anyway). I'm sure the authors did that becausethey spent 20 years interviewing millionaires and gathering information to write this book. As for putting the information in this book to work for you, though... it would still take a lot of homework on your own part. For example, the authors don't explain how to get a business started, they don't explain how to study the stock market, etc., and I'm not faulting them for not including such information, but just realize that this book is not a \\"how-to\\" type of book, although it is sort of close.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I know very little about Spider-Man but I have always enjoyed the cartoon and the few comics I have picked up.  Sitting down expecting great special effects, I was surprised by the plot, acting and special effects in the movie.  I liked how the Rami put in the wrestling, just like Peter Parker in the comics.  <BR>Toby was an excellent Spider-Man, very convincing as a person who is shy and sticks to himself.  His infatuation with MJ was discreet but, still visible to all around.  (kind of like Superman and Lana)<BR>The special effects with Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were incredible.  Although they were not necessarily realistic looking they were pleasing to the eye and kept you at the edge of the seat.<BR>Great movie.  Definetly a buy when it comes out on VHS/DVD.
B00005B6NC|4.0|My comments on the young actor Vin Diesel are nothing but positive. He is great in this film (I also liked his character in Fast And The Furious). The movie starts off on a ship with a bunch of people including some oo da boo da guy and his kids. A stuck up rich dude, and a whole buncha other people. But the ship is also carrying a psycotic killing madman named Riddick (Vin Diesel). Then... just as you thought everything was going to go alright(sarcasm) the ship runs into a meteor field, or what ever you call those little space rocks and then everything goes wrong. A whole bunch of passengers die, the ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, Riddick escapes, and when you thought it couldent get anyworse, they find out the only guy able to protect them from Riddick (untill he decides to help them) uses the drug morphene, and he's not realy an officer. Sounds like their [out of luck] huh? Well, no, not untill the alien thingers come out and start eating them one by one. But, luckily for them Riddick decides to help them survive thus, starting their thrilling journey. Realy, I thought the aliens (I call them Spike Drivers) were well done. It's to bad that everytime it shows them they are almost 100% computerised. The gore factor is alright I guess. As for thrills and chills it has alot of that as well as alot of action to. I'm pretty sure any si-fi thriller fan will like this, along with Vin Diesel fans.
0790729601|2.0|A hollow piece of movie-machinery with waste-of-space Schwarzenegger as some kind of FBI agent who specialises in Witness Protection.  Action and effects are piled high to little effect; the film has no center, no driving force and no charm.  Director Charles Russell tries to keep it all together but he clearly doesn't have a clue.
B00006690F|5.0|The Eminem Show is Slim Shady at his best. this album imo is far superior than the marshall mathers lp or the slim shady lp. the eminem show is exactly what the title says its a record about eminem and his life. \\"cleaning out my closet\\" is an awsome song that refers to his estranged mom. the eminem show also has a humerous side examples \\"without me\\" \\"drips\\" \\"Square Dance\\" the songs on the eminem show ae much deeper are much better. other notable songs are \\"say what you say\\" where em's mentor Dr. Dre and him bash Jurmaine Dupri. Other guest apperances on the album are nate dogg, d12, obie trice, and Aerosmith. yes i said aerosmith who have a guest apperance in the powerful \\"stan\\" like song called \\"sing for the moment\\". this album has classic eminem humor as well as deep songs. it s the best cd has put out so go buy it
B00005176F|5.0|Do I still have to review this awesome collection? Hah, of course, I'm one of the many of Blur's listeners (though I think that Oasis is better). To all those who haven't heard of other Blur's works except for the recent releases, \\"Tender\\", the cute video \\"Coffee and TV\\" and \\"Music is My Radar\\", and for those who love Coldplay, The Verve, Oasis or Starsailor, this CD is a must-have for you.<br />1)Beetlebum- And what is the unique title \\"Beetlebum\\" all about? Is it about a seductive girl? I'll leave that to you. Music-wise, Graham Coxon did a good job on it- recurring guitar tunes and all.<br />2) Song 2- It's also the 2nd track from the \\"Blur\\" album. It is barely 2 minutes but it rocks! The lyrics are however, quite off-beat but what the heck, WOOHOOO!!<br />3) There's No Other Way- It opens with rock n' roll-ing guitar effects. But I rarely play this over and over again. <br />5) Coffee and TV- Beatlesque music ( it also comes with the tinkling of the keyboards by the end of the song), catchy chorus and great vocals from Damon Albarn and his company.<br />6) Parklife- Narrative lyrics which comes with the usual British poppy tune. I just love this song!  <br />9) Tender- Quite unusual track from Blur. Sounds like a performance from MTV Unplugged... A choir joins Damon Albarn in the chorus,...Very neat.<br />10) Girls and Boys- Hey, Britpop music all the way! A timeless classic! Ear-friendly tune (which reminds me of Depeche Monde)<br />11) Charmless Man- Cheerful intro, keyboard effects and all that...Nanananananana<br />13) Country House- Usual poppy Blur sound,, still remarkable track.<br />18) Music Is My Radar- Catchy tune, well-ending track for the album.
6305508550|5.0|\\"Office Space\\" is a brilliant and totally spot-on satire of life in an office.  Mike Judge wrote and directed a quirky and unlikely story of office vengance.  The jokes are often subtle...but even the disguised jokes are belly laugh funny.<br />Using a cast of largely-unknown actors, Judge keeps the laughs coming.  Dietrich Bader (hilariously disguised in a mullet wig and biker mustache) provides a great white trash accent as Peter's goofy neighbor.  Our hero Peter is played by Ron Livingston.  Peter turns into an unlikely hero, doing what all of us wish we had the guts to do in our sterile office environments.  Peter's work buddies, Zamir Naginnajar and Michael Bolton (no relation) are perfect, played as everyday joes just trying to get by.  <br />Everyone knows someone like all of the characters in \\"Office Space\\", making it very familiar from the first viewing.  It's perfect for repeat viewings too and has more quotable lines than most movies released today.  I can't wait to see what Mike Judge does next.
B00004Z400|4.0|that's right! these guys are evolving along with their style,since adrenaline deftones started to make a softer sound to their following 2 albums....white pony is undoubtedly a masterpiece BUT  chino must go back a little to his authentic metal roots .....right!?
B00003CXI1|3.0|I have no quarrel at all with disc one in my recently purchased two DVD set. I enjoyed watching the film at home even more than in the theater. The transfer was sparkling, and the sound and score magnificent. <br />On disc two, my quarrels begin. Trying to view the extra features on the DVD was akin to torture. After hours of tootling with it I finally managed to watch the 7 deleted scenes, at least three of which were highly enjoyable, particularly the full scene of Snape's reprisals of young Harry and Hermione in the potions classroom (this should have been retained in the film!). I said ENJOYABLE, not worth the massive headache I had after a night of toying through senseless games and irreverent insults courtesy of Jim Dale, the narrator of the \\"books on tape\\" versions of the novels in the Harry Potter series. I previously enjoyed his work (he's a wonderful voice talent and brought real magic to the audiobooks) but this was just too much!<br />And at the same time, it wasn't enough. Rumor has it that four hours of footage were shot for this film, but we get seven deleted scenes of about 9 minutes total? After all the features I saw on television leading up to the film's release, they could only muster a very short and very talky \\"Interviews\\" segment? With the second film in post production the summer before its release, is it not time to reward loyal readers and watchers with a teaser trailer?  I enjoyed a very hilarous feature on NBC's dateline where Katie Kouric interviewed people at King's Cross Station about the whereabouts of Platforom 9 3/4. Would it have been too much trouble to include some fun for adults as well in the form of information about Harry Potter's massive impact on popular culture and literacy? About how the books fostered a new and fervent reading culture in our children?<br />I guess not...and as such, some of the most loyal fans of a great series have been pretty drastically let down.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Sorry Benjamin, I don't agree.  Please believe the hype.  But as one reviewer already said, &quot;You'll either love it or hate it.&quot;  And I loved this movie.  As the review on the box says, &quot;It'll knock your socks off.&quot;  And it knocked mine into the next stratosphere. And the actor Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) - WOW, WOW, WOW. This guy is off the charts GREAT.  Even if you don't like the movie, you'll love him - guaranteed.  Some big named actors could take some lessons from him :)  And I got the soundtrack to the movie which is haunting and beautiful.  This one I will watch many, many times.  Oh, and one other thing, this is one of those movies where if you have to take a bathroom break (or whatever), stop the movie, because you need to see everything so that you won't be lost.
0783116934|5.0|Based on the true story of the Russian serial killer, Andre Chikatilo, whose killing spree was first noted in 1982, spanning a decade, and claiming 52 victims of which the majority were children.<br />Steven Rea plays the methodical, brilliant, forensic specialist turned detective, in a bureaucratic country that hinders more often than helps his investigation. Donald Sutherland plays his superior and teacher in the ingenious art of subtle manipulation, so necessary when dealing with the upper echelon of the party. Together the two combine with a mix of humor, that comes as unexpected when dealing with such an ominous subject.<br />Faced again and again by a case ravaged by higher ups that seem to be more concerned with their station and privilege, than with bringing the fiend to justice, the tenacious detective Burakov (Rea) holds on to his theories and brings the killer to justice. This was an unexpected pleasure with superior acting on the part of all involved, well worth your time.  Kelsana 5/29/02
B00005JKJA|5.0|Ah, Los Angeles.  A thousand tales have already been told about the City of Dreams, and no wonder, with it being the most famous and faux-fabulous community of this modern age.  Some of these tales revel in grace and glamour, simply adding to the in-progress legend, while other storytellers attempt to deconstruct the façade, showing us the grit and grimy desperation seething under the surgeon-smiles and six-figure cars.   David Lynch's noir-ish _Mulholland Drive_ joins this latter group, and if you really pay attention while watching, you'll find that it makes sense - all of it -- even with just one viewing.  Massive in scope and brilliant in conception, _Mulholland Drive_ is, at its heart, a sad allegory of the quest for fame.  <br />It's disturbing how much power actually exists in LA.  The bulk of American media information/entertainment originates, via television and film, from this concrete patchwork of smog and sensual overload: it programs millions to laugh, cry, fear; it titillates us with trends, slyly winks as it snatches bill after bill from the wallet.  It sells illusions, that most sought-after commodity; and illusions are infectious.  <BR> <BR>Near the beginning we are treated to Naomi Watts descending from an airport terminal, blue eyes a-glow with the myriad possibilities that confront her: a perfect cornfed image of Hollywood hope.  She has been given some encouragement by an elderly couple, who say they will `watch out for her movie--' it's sweet, sincere, until the elderly couple get into a cab, upon which they both break into sinister chuckling.  They know.  They see it all the time.  Hollywood hope comes in by the busload, folks, fresh-faced would-be thespians seeking that ticket to eternal fame - a thousand a week, or so the estimate goes.  A lucky few make it.  Thousands upon thousands more work in bars or restaurants or descend into more unsavory occupations, trying to find the right contacts, the perfect pitch...but I digress: <br />David Lynch, master of the surreal styling, directed _Mulholland Drive_, and it brims with his standard trademarks: careful camera pans, suggestive editing, atmospheric music to create mood and heighten tension.  Some of Lynch's previous films have suffocated under his *modus operandi*, but here technique, impeccably fashioned as it is, serves a deeper and far more meaningful theme.  There is no self-indulgence here: everything happens for a reason, be it in dream or stark reality.  <br />Buried within the context of the film are a number of subtle (and not-so subtle) metaphors and allusions to the LA illusion-factory. There is a _lot_ I could mention/analyze, but words are precious (and limited), so let me state: One of the most striking (eg obvious) takes place during the theater scene, after the Mephesto-like performer exits amidst cheap brimstone.  A woman appears by a microphone, slouched and old, the heavy cosmetic care in the close-up still unable to totally disguise the wear.  In a vibrant voice she begins singing a familiar tune in Spanish.  At the peak, she collapses, presumably dead...but the song continues on, after the `machine' supposedly `voicing' it has broken down.  Rita and Betty shed tears.  They know, they know.  They see it all the time.  They are all players for the human appetite.  <br />Highly recommended for those of open perception.
B00006690F|5.0|Emienem's junior effort is hot.  His creative word play is untouchable.  It's no holds barred.  I see why people were rushing to get the copy off the internet.  He is very expressive about what's been going on in his life and the world.  He deals with WTC, Chandra Levy, and government attempts to censorship.  He also displays his feelings on his failed marriage, his severed relationship with his mother, and his undying love for his daughter. You can hear the pain & anger towards his mother on \\"Cleaning out my Closet\\".  This song made me truly appreciate my relationship with my mother.  The love for his daughter can be felt in \\"Hailie's Song\\".  His attempt to sing this for her shows his gentle parental side.  You can hear throughout several songs that he adores Hailie.  She's the reason for getting in the rap game.  In \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood,\\" he says \\"All I wanted was to give Hailie the things I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated\\".  Living in Detroit, Em was on the evening news every week last summer because the nightclub incident.  There were several stories reported about his and Kim's marriage.  I don't know if it made national news, but the news reported that Kim tried to commit suicide.  He did try to make his marriage work for the sake of his daughter. The Detroit news was practically Court TV.  <br />This CD is not as commercial as the Marshall Mathers LP, but will be as successful.  \\"White America\\" is straight to the point.  It doesn't matter if he's white in the Hip Hop community because he's got skills, but it really helped his record sales.  He wouldn't have sold as much or be able to get away half the things he says if he was black, but that's how the music industry works. <br />Eminem's \\"Superman\\" sounds like it was following the lead of LL Cool J's \\"I Need Love\\" until the last line of the chorus.  Groupies Beware!!!  \\"Drips\\" is safe sex message by storytelling without preaching.  He and D-12 sarcastically rap about how society say HipHop music has influenced the behavior of the youth on \\"When the Music Stops\\".  \\"Say What You Say\\" is classic Eminem.  He and Dre blast on little Papa Smurf J.D.  The final song is \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" with Hailie making her recording debut.  The DVD is 45 minutes worth of concert clips, interviews, and an episode of his animated show, Slim Shady.<br />All in all, this is a must buy.  This is his most artistic effort to date.  He strips away layers of complexity song after song. I can't wait to 8 Mile this summer/fall.  The part of the movie was made near my neighborhood.  The production was crew was really nice.  They let me watch them film a few scenes.
0671688782|5.0|I did holding time with my and 8 & 9 year old sosn (We are now adopting him), and I feel Holding Time was essential to our bonding and attachment to each other. Without it, I don't feel I would have been able to get together with my child. my child was neglected and abused at an early age and he suffers from attachment disorder. Through Holding Time techniques I was able to overcome his emotional distress. I felt so much hope and I could see the part of him that  was usually covered up. I had no anger and felt only closeness and tenderness. I was able to share his sadness and pain. In a way I think Holding Time helped me give birth to my adopted boy. I now feel very close to him and he to me.
0451526015|4.0|This is a book for the mind! Extremely philosophical, extremely thought provoking! One character in particular talked all in philosophy. There were things he said that would practically keep me up all night thinking. This book is also a good example of how a bad influence can turn a good person into a down right evil one. But the way Oscar Wilde chooses to portray that in the story is so creative. Also I didn't find this book to be as predictable as most tend to be. I thought the ending was especially unpredictable and creative. The only complaints I have are that in a couple parts it got a little bit slow and it was pretty morbid. I do like happy endings and this book traveled further and further from a happy ending with every page. I guess that's okay because the point Wilde was trying to make was not happy. So overall I rate this book high and recommend it to anyone interested!
B0000025C0|3.0|Boston's debut album, Boston, was sensational. More Than A Feeling was their follow up and while a strong album in itself it let down some expectations, even if this was unfair. This album does sport some strong tracks with More Than A Feeling fitting right in with the previous album's tracks. But from there, it went a bit downhill. I still give this project 3 stars, which I rate as good because it is good and is measured against one of the best recordings in 1970's rock. If this would have been a debut album it would have rated far higher. <br />For someone who liked the first album this will be enjoyable too, only not quite as consistent. But still worth the price.
B000003S5H|4.0|I first hear dthe song \\"Sexy Boy\\" in the movie 10 Things I Hate About You. I fell in love right away with the charming young songs in the french dialect. The music instruments were what caught my ear. Use of keyboards and other instruments make this album one of my favorites. \\"Ce Matin La\\" was also in The Virgin Suicides, which is one of my favorite movies. This is a good cd to just cruise around town listening to. Introduce people to Air, they'll love them!
B00000DFSK|3.0|I bought this cd with the new Limp Biskit album.  Obviously these are very different bands.  LB's cd had crisp clear sound with good bass, while the U2 cd sounded flat and monotone.  Whoever did the sound engineering should be fired.  Except for the last two songs, I thought I was listening to a cassette player.  I have a rather expensive stereo system and was very disappointed with this quality.  At a time where high quality MP3 and MP4 music competes with traditional CD music, they should be doing more to make the CDs alternative look attractive.<br />As for the songs, they're the same old songs that are overplayed on the radio except for a couple that are pretty bad.  I don't know why I bought it, it didn't even have ONE on it.  I wonder why!
B00005B36H|3.0|At first I only bought this cd for \\"Schism\\" when I hear dit on the ... music awards ... I later saw the music video which also haunted me. This is a good cd for anyone willing to try something different. The words are very meaningful also as well as the tone. I give this cd 3 stars for its ingenious use of imagery and beautifully structured songs.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I am going to keep this simple. India Arie's Acoustic Soul was the best thing that happened musically in 2001.  What a shame that her work was ignored by both the Grammy's and the Soul Train Music Awards.  Her work is far superior than that of Alicia Keyes (too overrated). Arie has a real message in her music. The lyrics are poetic and poignant.  The music is soulful and classy.  I am so looking forward to her new CD in fall 2002. Keep your head to the sky India and stay true to yourself.  Please don't let the industry cause you to compromise who you are.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|First off, Angelina glows here but besides that, this movie spells out the extraordinary dynamics of all human relationships and makes one think of the fraility of it all.  Definitly a film for romantics as well jazz lovers.  Well worth the time and space on your shelf.
B000065U1N|5.0|This was an awesome movie. Definetly watch it. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, any war movies you would like this. Ridley Scott did an excellent job. Read the Book it is by Mark Bowden. An A+ movie.
B00005JKG7|5.0|After huge, and unexpected success with Halloween. John Carpenter needed another chiller to keep the priase coming. The Fog turned out to be the right choice. To me it still seems underated. The plot is not as simple as Halloween.<br />It's about a small town of the east coast that is about to celebrate its 100th birthday. It turns out that 100 years ago a bunch of sailors were mudered and there bodys fell to the bottom of sea. Now there back for their revenge. Hal Hollbrook plays a catholic priest who discovers the news first, because he finds a diary of one of the killers in the wall of the church. His performance and the rest of the cast is great.<br />Finaly there is a DVD release of this cult classic coming.
0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down  is a wonderfully written book and is based on an actual event.  <BR>The setting is in the poverty infested city of Mogadishu, Somalia in October of 1993.  The city was run by war lords and their militia.  A special task force called Task Force Ranger composed of United States Army Rangers, the special anti-terrorist Delta Force, and the best of the best helicopter pilots the Night Stalkers. They  where sent in to be peace keepers so the Red Cross could give food to all of the people who were starving.  This task force was backed up by the 10th Mountain Division troops and Malaysian armor.  <BR>In the city however the strongest militia in Mog ( Mogadisu, as the troops called it ) was led by Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  He was mainly responsible for the stealing of food from the Red Cross.  On October 3 the task force tried to capture some of Adids high ranking officials in broad day light and in the middle of the Bakara Market which was the most guarded in the city.  As they fought in the city two Black Hawks got shoot down. The whole mission went from a capture the enemy to rescue the pilots.  The story is about  the strongest and most feared military soldiers fighting for their lives.  They are out numbered and pinned down in a little one by one block area.  <BR>I really enjoyed this book for the excitement and the stories of the soldiers on both sides of the fight.  It is a complete story with all of the facts.  I thought it was great.  I also enjoyed the movie.  I thought  it was one of the most well written and good books out there for a factual book.
B00000JXV7|4.0|This is a concise and effective little film. Everything seems to be preventing Ben Affleck from arriving on time and marrying Maura Tierney his fianc&eacute;e of an upper crust family in Savannah, Georgia. Affleck gets coupled with bohemian Sandra Bullock and starts to fall for her. Maura Tierney does an excellent job with her role and actually saves this film from being just another clich&eacute; statement on boy-meets-other-girl. Your heat will just go out to Tierney. Sandra Bullock also has more at stake if she just falls for Affleck. The script tries to put you in the mind of Affleck and the indecisiveness he is experiencing. This is more than just a head-over-heels love story on a whim. It makes the viewer experience the emotional turmoil that the main characters are going through. This is a highly underrated story I am sure that many people can identify with. The Full-Frame VHS copy was more enjoyable than the DVD. The VHS Surround Sound complimented the film much better than the DVD version.
B000002MX7|5.0|Chaka Khan is one of the best female singers of all time. Before going solo, she was with the group Rufus and with them enjoyed success with such killer hooks as \\"Tell Me Something Good\\", \\"Sweet Thing\\", and \\"Stay\\". Then in 1978 we saw the release of her first gold solo album, CHAKA. There we got \\"I'm Every Woman\\" obviously destined to become a soul classic, and inevitably became her signature song. Throughout the 80s Chaka release some remarkable albums. One of my favorites was NAUGHTY and I am surprised that \\"Clouds\\" was not included in this set. Then in 1984 Chaka came out with \\"I Feel For You\\" which introduced her to a whole new set of devoted fans. This collection is a definite must for any soul music fan! Buy this and believe me, you will not regret listening to one of the best and strongest voice in music.
0066620996|5.0|Well, that's how the book opens.  It is not an understatement.  This book helps people at all levels understand what hard work needs to be accomplished in order to make the jump to Great.  It can be done.  What is required?  Confront the brutal facts about needed changes:  who should be on the bus and who should not be?  Do we have a culture of discipline?  What about the one thing we can truly be the best in the world at; are we doing that?  <br />This book is loaded with improvement opportunities for every company.  It is an enjoyable read, Jim is an amazing author and speaker, and I have personally tried to apply suggestions made in the book.<br />Oh, if you think you are a Level 5 leader, you probably are not!
B00000DFRS|4.0|anyone who doesn't like this cd must not have heard it right,...whitney houston, in my opinion is one of the most talented artists in the music world!her voice may not sound to unique at first, but if you listen closer, you will feel incredible depth, which is something i love about whitney.This album really is her best!!!!!11i mean,i bought when it came out, and i have not taken it out of my stereo ever since, because each and every song is incredible, and i mean simply incredible.I didn't have to skip  over anytracks,so if you love great music, and extremely talented artists that have stood over the test of time,get this album!!!!!!
B000065U1N|4.0|To start this off, I'd like to say that in general this was an excellent movie. The only people that have given this movie 1 star was because they were anti-war fanatics and just want to downgrade war in general. This movie is very realistic for the most part, absolutely action-packed, and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat from the second that the fighting begins.<br />On the other hand, like a lot of American war films...this movie is extremely biased towards the American side of the story, not to mention the fact that it also only focuses on the American troops fighting...and not the Pakistani and other troops helping the UN side. It also portrays the Somalis as heartless people, when they were no more heartless then the Americans fighting.<br />All in all, it is still a great movie, I'd recommend it to anyone that isn't weak of the heart.
B00005Y228|4.0|Although a relative newcomer to the US, Kylie has become almost a national institution in her homeland, Australia, and in the UK. When listening to Kylie's early hits like \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" and \\"Locomotion\\", it's amazing to see how much she's grown since the heydays of the Scott/Aitken/Waterman partnership (Kylie's former management and songwriting team.) Her new album, Fever, has seen her reach international acclaim, mostly supported by the amazingly infectious single \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\". Other highlights include \\"In Your Eyes\\", a darker dance track, but still incredibly catchy.<BR>Fans of this album may also want to try \\"Light Years\\" - the album before \\"Fever\\". It's more camp and kitsh than the sophisticated dance of her recent offering, but there are some great pop songs. \\"Spinning Around\\", written by Paula Abdul, is a nice, feel-good song, with perhaps a 70s disco feel. Another good track is her duet with Robbie Williams, \\"Kids\\", a rock-tinged track, with a video that provoked rumours of a relationship between the pair. Those looking further back should try listening to \\"Wild Rose\\", with Nick Cave. Be warned, however, it's a bit too post-modern, and much darker than most of Kylie's music: it's about a husband who beats his wife to death (!). Also great is \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" (cerca 1990). Listen out for the hidden hints about Kylie's love life: the lyrics advise Kylie to choose Jason Donavon (her childhood sweetheart, with whom she starred in Neighbours, the Australian soap in which she made her name) rather than the late, Michael Hutchence, the controversial singer of INXS.<BR>Anyho, this is a great album, and a must for all pop and dance fans.

B000002HJA|5.0|Josh Homme may despise the term \\"stoner rock\\" but this really is an example of the genre at it's best. Absolutely amazing groove and Homme's guitar work is excellent. Buy this if you like Queens of the Stoneage. Buy it if you don't. You will not be disappointed. This is quite possibly one of the greatest albums ever made.
1558216847|5.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" by Slavomir Rawicz, Audio Version, Blackstone Audio Books, Ashland, Oregon, 1990.  Read by Bernard Mayes.  Eight 1-½ hour cassettes.<br />This is a remarkable story of suffering, endurance, perseverance and loyalty. Slavomir Rawicz was a cavalry officer in the Polish Army when Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia divided Poland. Arrested by the Soviets in 1939, Rawicz was put on \\"trial\\" for espionage against the Soviet Union, mainly on the grounds that Rawicz spoke Russian.  Why else would a Pole learn Russian ... obviously to spy!  Convicted, he is sent to a labor camp in Siberia.  Usually, this is enough for good story.  The Polish cavalry officer, however, after enduring the hardships of walking, in a raging blizzard, from the railhead to the labor camp, decides to escape.<br />With a little help from the wife of the Camp Commander, Rawicz escapes with six other prisoners, along with a makeshift knife and an ax head without a handle.  They walk out of Siberia in the \\"warm\\" part of the year, meet a displaced Polish woman (almost a young girl) and include her in their plans.<br />Their plans include walking along the side of the biggest lake in the world, crossing the Gobi dessert without a vessel to carry water, climbing through the Himalayas (without oxygen at heights where it was needed) and finally coming out in British India.  The lone American (identified only as Mr. Smith) then uses his command of English to explain their great trek to the British Army.  It is almost impossible to believe all the hardships they must endure.  They survive the Gobi by eating large black snakes, and the butchering and cooking is described too graphically.  They meet various native individuals, and are greeted courteously and sometimes charmingly, despite the lack, sometimes, of a language in common.<br />The young girl dies in the Gobi.  The Pole, who sang Christmas carols on Christmas Eve, falls to his death in the mountains.  All the escapees lose much weight and they all grow beards and much hair, so that, when they are being medically treated in India, they are surprised to see what each other looks like.

0142000663|5.0|John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath in 1939 on account of the great dust bowl in the 1920's. This horrible blight upon the land caused the topsoil to be literally non-existent; choking off crops of grapes, corn, and other crops that tenant workers of the time depended on for every day survival.<br />  The Grapes of Wrath is indisputably Steinbeck's best novel ever written, and is one of the best and most well known novels in history. The Grapes of Wrath also brought Steinbeck a Nobel Prize in literature, and world praise for his realistic depictions of daily, southern California life on the ranch, and the troubles that eat at the inhabitants daily.<br /> The Grapes of Wrath is a story that starts out with tom, a regular man, who is in search of his family. Tom soon finds out that his family has been forced to move to California the land of \\"new opportunities,\\" because the bank had repossessed everyone's land in that region for the growth of cotton, since the soil was so bad. Along the way, however, the family undergoes many hardships such as lack of money, food, and low, tired spirits. Finally, the family reaches a fertile valley in southern California where peaches are grown. The family picks the peaches for the farm, but soon loose their dream job due to difficulties. The family must now resume their search for a suitable job that is capable of supporting the over ten members of the family. The question is, will the family get their needs met by the new job, or will they find that hardships are too difficult in California, and they must move elsewhere?  Steinbeck used chapters in the book describing the main family of the novel, but meant to be a broader, more generalized group. The dialogue in these chapters is not suggested with quotations, but is rather noticed by the reader through the different tones. This gives the further impression of hardship by allowing the reader to make associations to ones that they know whom have gone through the likewise.<br /> Steinbeck's classic novel, The Grapes of Wrath is a very sad book, however shows a very realistic view of life at that time and location. It shows themes of endurance through hardship, the importance of family, and that one day, a hope may be come upon, no matter how hard it may be to get there. For Steinbeck's great story telling capabilities, as well as his great usage of local dialogue, intricate character description, and portrayal of daily life, I deem this one of the best novels that I have ever read, and I gladly recommend it to all those who are up for a good classic.se.  <BR> Steinbeck's classic novel, The Grapes of Wrath is a very sad book, however shows a very realistic view of life at that time and location.

B00006690F|4.0|You see, im not an Eminem fan. Actually, far from it. More like Nickelback and stuff like that. But, I liked Without Me, so I bought the album. <br />If u ask for my opinion, this is the strongest stuff Ive heard in years. With 20 songs on the album, 5 are skits, leaving 15 powerful songs. Really powerful. If you listen to this album, and try to compare it to Marshall Mathers L.P., you'd be surprised. Eminem, for once, is pouring out his heart. He's not just dissing other artists (well he is in Without Me, but thats OK since thats like the only song he does it on, but who likes Moby anyways? I dont!), he's talking about his mom, Hallie, and several other things that have affected him in the past. Especially his dad leaving him, and his mom trying to control him. Even if you are not an Eminem fan (like me, for example. I'm only 13), you'd be surprised after hearing this album. <br />I think the best songs on this album are Hallie's Song, White America, My dads gone crazy and Sing for the Moment. Sure, most of them are great, but there's 2 I dont really care for, but thats better than the amount I cared for from the last album. <br />This album has some catchy tunes, and has some interesting lyrics. I'd suggest it, whether or not you are an Eminem fan. It's a great mix, and I like it. Maybe you will, too.<br />~Be sure to listen to My Dads Gone Crazy, because Hallies in the song, and its pretty good. Its kinda cute, not something Ive heard from Eminem before~<br />Go Buy it!!!!
038533558X|5.0|I can't say enough about this book! I throughly enjoyed it! It was the best suspense novel I've read in a long time! I've never read anything by this author before. I usually read Patterson, Cornwell, Higgins Clark, Sandford, Iles, etc... I had no idea this man could write such an intense novel.  It was suspensful from the very beginning. And it had you guessing until the very last page.  I have 2 young children so it is extremely hard for me to find time to read. However, I finished it within a week.  I honestly can't explain the enjoyment this book provided. It comes highly recommended because it is sure to impress you too.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This double album is filled with a variety (jazzy, funky, spiritual, mellow, etc.) of great songs. (the original vinyl also included a bonus mini-album, but it all fits on 2 CD's.)  The song &quot;Sir Duke&quot; was among the main reason I picked this one up.  It's a great horn-powered song that makes everyone want to get up and dance. (&quot;you can feel it all over...&quot;)  That song is sandwiched in between 2 other great ones.  &quot;Contusion&quot; sounds like it could fit in on Jeff Beck's fusion &quot;Blow By Blow&quot;.  (Stevie did write a couple songs on that disc!)  It is followed by &quot;I Wish&quot;, a bouncy nostalgia-for-childhood song.  Check  out &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot;.  Coolio totally ripped it off on his &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot;.  I think he just changed the one word.  Some highlights from the second disc are &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot;, &quot;As&quot;, and &quot;Always&quot;.

B00004Z4WQ|4.0|When I saw Scary movie in the theater, I had some chuckles with the shock humor take on Scream but there are two scenes that were deleted and now appear in the DVD that are the BEST.  <br />One has Shorty and his girlfriend up in the bedroom and he wants to have sex with her but she is scared with all the murders happening.  He assures her that it is okay and she inquires that if they are going to DO IT then he better have protection.  What follows is a hysterically funny sexual encounter with the two characters while they are holding guns to warn off any lurking murderer.  <br />The second deleted scene has to do with the other Waynan's brother who has homosexual tendencies.  He is on the football field and starts yelling the Hut #s before the play but seems to like saying \\"HUT 69\\" over and over and over again.  These two scenes cracked me up and made the movie for me - I only wish they hadn't been cut out of the original but I am glad that they are on the DVD because they are hilarious!

B000000H66|5.0|I bought this album at the day it came out, listened to it about 4 times in a row and understood that this was waayyy over my head. As if the previous \\"Individual Thought Patterns\\" record by the incredible talented Chuck Schuldiner (RIP) wasn't complex and challenging enough, \\"Symbolic\\" is the kind of record you'll have a hard time getting used to. <br />When I put the CD into rotation again this year (by accident), \\"Symbolic\\" finally began to take form. First and foremost, I still can't say that I completely \\"understand\\" this album with all it's mind-boggeling musicanship, twisted yet melodic songwriting ( that middle part of \\"Zero Tolerance\\" will make your head explode ) and daring, introspective lyrics. If you've listened to DEATH's earlier albums you will notice that Chuck sings a bit higher than usual on this record, sometimes reminding of early KREATOR but always holding his own and often, accompanied by melodic guitar leads, comes across even more powerful than before. He's in good company with Bobby Koeble on rythem/lead guitars, Kenny Colon on Bass and monster-drummer Gene Hoglan giving his best performance to date on any album. Weird enough that a band like TOOL, with a certain acceptance among the rock-audience would wet their pants when confronted with the futuristic musicanship and songwriting on a record like this, yet the general puplic still ignores really groundbreaking musicans like DEATH.<br />Lyricalwise, Chuck is on top of his game here, while the lyrics on the former albums (HUMAN and INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT PATTERNS especially) often ended up in methaphorical press-bashing his work on Symbolic is, as said, very introspective , full of self-questioning and heartfelt emotion. It requires a second, or even fifth look to warm up to what he has to say though, but if you're not willing to invest some time before really getting into a record, you should stay away from this album anyway.<br />With all that said, SYMBOLIC is highly recommended to everyone interested in deep musical experiences. Beware though, this isn't easy to grip and even though it's as far as can be from self-gloryfying musicanship such as DREAM THEATER, it's still hard to swallow for the average listener. Chuck, if you're reading this : You should know by now that you've been a highly influencial musician. If those angry catholics up there get on your nerves because of that inverted cross thing, just make 'em listen to SYMBOLIC and all should be forgiven...

A beautifully written and well-thought out series, it is contemporary fiction at its best: it enchants while it encourages thought and debate.  Do your kids (and yourself) a favor: get these books and read them together.

Overwhelming spiritual movement of an epic masterpiece can only be performed by the gigantic, oversized of a genius named Sylvester, Sylvester Stallone! He hath brought retribution to the movie audiences after \\"Rhinestone\\", another ideal flick. YES, hamanee times do I have to tell you that this movie is the real deal.

0375703861|5.0|If this book would have been a play I would have stood up and clapped at the end of it. The underlying mythological themes (twins; travel to the axis munde; evil vs. good; earth mothers) keep this novel alive and swiftly moving. The beginning of this novel places us in a most destitute state in which we are about to witness a suicide.  The character is slowing suffocating (and intoxicating...much like our favorite god Bacchus) himself with the carbon monoxide of his car.  As he is about to pass out, a butcher knocks on the window and tells him how there \\"sha'nt be any dying on HIS property.\\"  With this simple message, our character has decided that the gods have given him a sign (and another chance) that he should live.  What a careful introduction to a man who often chooses which direction to turn in life with the flip of a coin. The book follows Archie (our former suicide-attempter), his friend Samad (an Indian man who's only claim to fame is that his great grandfather was the first man to rise against the tyranny of the British Empire...and the first to be shot), their wives, and their children.  Poignant and lyrically enthralling, I would recommend this book to any reader who is looking for a little more substance. A++++++++

0761536434|3.0|The saving grace of this book is the fact that it includes a lot of quotes from the designers and businessmen behind the evolution of video games.  The material is top notch, and you can tell that Steve Kent really did his homework.<br />That said, the book is not very coherent, lacking any kind of linear structure to tie all this together.  Kent jumps around back and forth through the years, and for a reader that isn't familiar with the timeline of gaming history, it would be very hard to follow.  The lack of structure also makes for a lot of repetition, as Kent covers the same material several times throughout the book.<br />However, the content makes up for the lack of structure, and in the end I would have to say that this is a very informative read for anyone that is really into gaming history.
B00005RFAI|5.0|So, we had Madonna, Janet and Michael Jackson, and George Michael as the hit-makers of the 80's. In the 90's we had Mariah Carey, Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion, and Boyz II Men. Many of these are still making hits today, but the 2000's I think have potential to be dominated by one very talented young lady named Pink. Let's take a look....<br />In the late-spring and early summer of 2000, Pink burst onto the music scene with her infectious first single \\"There U Go.\\" It was a huge hit (I think I heard it on the radio hourly.) She released her debut \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" and showed her hand at R&B. Later in 2000, she released \\"Most Girls\\" which proved to be another big hit. Then in early 2001, we got \\"You Make Me Sick\\" which wasn't as big as the previous two singles, but turned out to be a decent radio hit. In the summer of 2001, Pink appeared with Christina Aguilera, Mya, and Lil Kim on \\"Lady Marmalade\\" which was probably the biggest song of the year (and I also think Pink had the best vocals on it.) So now here we are in late-2001 and Pink is ready to release her sophomore album....<br />\\"Get the Party Started\\" was the first single from Missundaztood and I think it was a great bridge from the first album. It's a great pop song and turned out to be yet another massive hit for her. It'll probably go down in history as THE high school dance song-opener. After hearing GTPS and buying the album, I gave it a listen and was a little skeptical. It was quite a change. It took me a few listens to really get the just of it. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is the 2nd single and a song any teenager can relate to and yet again, has given Pink a big hit. \\"My Vietnam\\" and \\"Lonely Girl\\" are confessional songs at their greatest. Then we my absolute favorite track...\\"Just Like A Pill\\" (which is incidently her next single.) It is a definite hit with its catchy chorus and punkish over-tones (but Pink's vocals make up for it.)<br />So, in conclusion, this is a very versatile album. Pop, R&B, blues, and punk/rock. It's definitely worth checking out. Parents, use caution though. There is some profanity and sexual under-tones.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is a excellent movie, with great acting, great effects and most important of all, a great story. Fincher shows how great movies are made. This is Finchers best movie by far and is very UNDERATED! People who don't get the story automatically say its a stupid depressing movie. To tell you the truth, I didn't get it to much when I first saw it, but then I saw it again and again and again. Its one of those movies that doesn't get old after you watch 10 times! It also shows the talent in Norton and Pitt. Its Edward Nortons 2nd best performance(American History X being 1st). I think that Everyone should see this movie more than once to actually get the story! Also, the dvd is EXCELLENT and has great sound, picture and extras! TRUST ME this movie has everything to be a classic movie!

It has a very good story and great acting by all the actors. People don't give movies like this the respect it deserves! This is also another movie that you can watch over and over again and it doesn't get boring. David Fincher is a great Director and this movie is really his first really good movie. I recommened this movie to any fans of great movies. The DVD is also very good with plenty of extras, perfect sound (DTS) and excellent sound! If you haven't seen this movie, go out and buy it, Its great!!
014028009X|4.0|This is an awesome book! I had first heard about this book by seeing the movie, which was very funny. I then decided to read the book which I had heard was based upon Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Having read Austen's novel (which i did not like) I hoped that this version would be much more appealing to the 21st century reader. And, luckily it was. Bridget(a clumsy, insecure, chain-smoking Elizabeth Bennet) was lovable because of her flaws and self questioning. I think that anyone can identify with her obsessiveness over her weight, love life, and career. I thought that Bridget was also a complex character who was just trying to find her own definition of happiness in a world where TV and aquaintances are constantly trying to define happiness for her. The idea of telling the story of Bridget Jones through a diary was ingenious of Helen Fielding. It allowed the reader to go into the mind of the main character and see what she was really like without the facade of confidence that we all wear in front of others. I also enjoyed Bridget's lovable and also confused friends Sharon, Jude, and Tom. Their prescence made Bridget's behavior seem more normal and everyday. And I laughed out loud at Bridget's midlife crisis mother who is a great modern day parallel to Austen's marriage-crazed Mrs. Bennet. Her carefree and nonchalant attitude toward everything, including her own conviction, was hilarious! Her crazy antics were an overexaggeration of the things that mothers do that drive us crazy! While laughing at Mrs. Jones' crazy antics, i could also sympathize with poor Mr. Colin Jones, who was hung-out-to-dry by his wife. The last main characters are to me the most important beside Bridget herself. Daniel Cleaver is the epitomy of a modern day Mr. Wickham, a \\"player\\" or a man who uses a women for his own selfish fulfillment and then leaves without a trace. The reader can sypathize with Bridget because we have all known someone who has been used and then been left out in cold. But then, there is Mark Darcy, a modern day protrayal of (guess who) Mr. Dacry. He appears as a knight on a white horse, ready to sweep Bridget away from her annoying family and embarrasing carrer in TV. But the way he appears is very subtle but realistic. He is a shy man who does things that silent manner that seems to make the action all the more important and endearing. This novel was a joy to read, i recomend to everyone that wishes to read a book that is more about examining your own flaws and laughing at them through the main character, Bridget Jones.

B00005JKCF|5.0|I was absolutely shocked at Ebert's review of this movie. His views boiled down to one thing . . . It wasn't realistic enough. How in the WORLD do you expect a movie about a teen with the abilities of a human spider to be \\"realistic?!\\"<br />I have been a Spider-Man fan since the third grade and I absolutely LOVED this movie. I'm sure that people may think that I am biased. I disagree. A person who knows the ins and outs of the comics and who is a huge fan would be the BEST critic. If they messed anything up, we'd be all over it with various gripes. But this movie was spectacular. Tobey Maguire was the best choice imaginable for the hero. Willem Defoe was a spellbinding Norman Osborn/Green Goblin! And, though I thought the choice poor at first, Kirsten Dunst was a stellar Mary Jane.<br />The only gripe that I have is the fact that his webs are organic, but the absolute awesomeness (is that a real word?) of this movie makes that one thing trivial. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I have . . . THREE TIMES!!!

B00005JKJA|1.0|This movie marks the one (and only time) that I have ever listened to a certain co-worker when picking a movie. Craziness and the inability to follow a plot does NOT make a movie a classic. It makes it garbage . . . And this movie certainly fits that term.<br />I STILL don't know what happened. I've since read online reviews that tried to explain it, but I don't see how they are coming up with their opinions. If a movie requires massive amounts of discussion just to figure out what happened, then this is a DOWNFALL! Come on, people! How can anybody give this movie TWO stars, let alone FIVE?!<br />And, about twenty minutes before the end, the movie goes from being an impossible to follow mystery . . . to a PORN flick! I know that this made the move more \\"watchable\\" to some people, but, in my opinion, it caused even more deterioration to a movie that I had thought couldn't deteriorate any further.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I'm not a Harry Potter reader, but  I still love the movie. The DVD edition has terrific anamorphic video and great sound.

I'd just like to see them without wading through silly games and &quot;tours.&quot; Come on, DVD authors, we are not all 11 year old wizards. We muggles just want to view the features.

One of the parts is to get discharged from the army, you have to be crazy. To say you are crazy, you have to ask the the doctor to keep you on the ground, but as soon as you say your crazy and want to be grounded, Catch-22 says you have to be sane to say your crazy so therefore you have to continue. The book is about a fleet of bombers that are bombing cities in Germany. They are constantly made to bomb  The whole book was filled with crazy people, like Dunbar, he would do things he hated doing, because it would make time go by slowley.  Dunbar thought this would make his life longer.  Orr, had to be one of the wierdest guys out there with his stories about putting crabapples in his cheeks or the protitude that hit him with a shoe. The book is mostly composed of learning about characters and then their stories add on to a plot line indirectly. Throughout the book, it reveals more and more of a plot, about escaping war.  I recomend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor and enjoy books about war.
B00006690F|5.0|Yes, Eminem delivers again in his newest masterpiece, The Eminem Show. <br />The first song on the album is \\"White America.\\" It's defiantly Eminem's music, as it's hard rap, telling all of white america that he could be one of your kids. It's 5 stars out of 5 stars, one of Eminem's finest songs on the CD indeed.<br />Buisness is the next song. It's a pretty good song, relating to superheros getting down to buisness...Dr.Dre is featured in the beginning. 4 out of 5 stars.<br />Cleaning out my Closet is a very personal song to Eminem's momma. He basically bashes her, and it is a great tune. Defiantly 5 out of 5 stars. <br />Square Dance is a techno-ish song. I like the backround music during the chorus, but you really cant hear what Slim is saying throughout the song at times, espically through the chorus. 3 out of 5 stars. <br />Soldier is next. I like the beat, pretty nice flow, pretty personal too. 4 out of 5 stars.<br />Sayin Goodbye to Hollywood is the next song. Some people I know don't care for the song, but I'm a huge fan of it. The chorus sounds brilliant and the rapping is Eminem at his best. 5 out of 5 stars.<br />Now we get to my next song Drips. This is hands down my favorite song on the CD. Rapper Obie Trice sings most of it, and I have to hand it to him, he's very good. HILARIOUS lyrics, and it will easily get 5 stars...hey, it even sends a postive message to kids as do a few songs throughout the CD.<br />Without Me follows Drips and it is the hit single of the CD. Without Me is a music video on MTV, and the most popular song on The Eminem Show. Still, I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars for its somewhat limited lyrics, althought I love the Moby and N'Sync bashing. <br />Sing for the Moment is a cover of Aerosmith's Dream On smash hit, with Tyler singing the chorus. Brilliant cover, incredible lyrics, one of the best songs of Eminem's career. Easily gets a 5/5.<br />Superman is more hip-hopish and explains Eminem's dating life to a certain extent. Great beat,good lyrics...5/5.<br />Halie's Song is kind of a dare I say it, popish song but sounds very good coming from Eminem. The kid can sing though as he proves it tonight. Great song, catchiest on the album, 5/5.<br />When the Music Stops features D12 singing on it, decent lyrics, solid beat...4/5.<br />Say What U Say features Dre and is an overall good song...4/5.<br />Till I Collaspe is a weaker song on the album, but still good...it has Nate Dogg on it, and gets 3/5.<br />The last song is My Dad's Gone Crazy with Eminem's daughter, Hailie Jade singing some. 4/5, cute song, pretty clever stuff.

The book is about a fleet of bombers that are bombing cities in Germany. They are constantly made to bomb, even when they are suppose to be sent home. The whole book is filled with crazy people, like Dunbar, he does things he hates doing, because it would make time go by slowly. Dunbar thought that it would make his life <BR>longer. Orr, has to be one of the weirdest guys out there, like when he talks about putting crabapples in his cheeks when he was little or the prostitute that hit him with a shoe because Orr paid her to do so. The book is mostly composed of learning about characters and then their stories add on to a plot line indirectly. Throughout the book, it reveals more and more of the maincplot, escaping war. I recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor and enjoy books about war. I will read this book again, just because it was an all around good book.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Funny what criteria gets awards sometimes.  Sometimes it's essentially a long-time service award, like John Wayne's Oscar, or Russell Crowe getting one for &quot;Gladiator&quot;, when it supposedly was for his performance the year before.  I will admit that I got this mostly because of all the Grammy attention, and then just to hear the hit song.  <br />However, after quite a few plays, this is a very good album.  In my opinion, it's not that groundbreaking, even though there are a bunch of outside contributors.  No, it's just the band doing what it's been doing every since I've been buying records, and doing it very well.  Yes, Santana's music often sounds like a beer commerical, and in this case &quot;Smooth&quot; really sounds like a beer commercial.  <br />But take out the big single, and there's still a lot of good stuff here.  One would think that after listening to Carlos Santana's guitarwork for almost thirty years, it would start sounding the same.  I didn't have that problem here.  There are plenty of songs that stretch out long enough to give his guitar a workout.  If you like this, and I did, then this is a very good record.  And the beer commercial is pretty good, too.
0804106304|5.0|This novel was an exceptional piece of literature.  I have never read anything by Amy Tan before, but I can honestly state that it is one of the most beautiful and thought provoking stories I have ever read.  <BR> This story is about four Chinese mothers, who grew up during China's war with Japan, and before China became an officially Communist country, and their daughters, who grew up in America.  The Joy Luck Club is a gathering of their families to celebrate life and heritage.  Each of the mothers and daughters tell their own story, with the exception of Suyuan, whose story was told by her daughter because the book begins about three months after she has died.  Each chapter can be looked at as a separate story, but the book still floes together beautifully.  Most of the novel is set in a series of flashbacks, which give the readers an opportunity to understand the mothers, and the ways that their childhood and histories affected the decisions they made and the way that they raised their daughters.  However, the mothers and the daughters have a hard time communicating with one another, and not because they do not understand each other's languages.  They have a hard time communicating because the mothers and the daughters do not understand each other.  <BR> Each of the mothers has been through a very traumatic experience either as a child or as a young woman.  They were all taught by their society that they were worth almost nothing, and judged \\"by their husband's belch.\\"  They were not valued for who they were as individuals, and each gained a sense of self-awareness because of their experiences.  The readers gain insight on what life was like for these four amazing, strong, spirited women.  Their daughter's stories involve the ways that their mothers raised them, and how it has affected them as adults.  While their experiences are, for the most part, far less traumatic then their mother's, they have hard times as well.  All of them have problems understanding their parents, who try to raise them with the same guidelines with which they were raised, but with the sense of American pride and self-worth.   Nonetheless, all of the daughters interpret their mother's pressure the wrong way.  They feel that they are a constant disappointment to their mothers.  Unfortunately, they do not realize that their mother's constant pressure and subtleties in behavior happen because their mothers want to show them that they love them.  This novel  shows how important it is to know your mother, before it is too late.  <BR> One of the main themes and concepts of this wonderful novel is that you must understand your mother and your past before you can understand yourself, and that you must never doubt your own self-worth.  <BR> This novel is the most beautiful, heart-warming, and meaningful mother-daughter story that I have ever read.  It explores mother-daughter relationships with heart-felt honesty and beauty, and has universal appeal.  Its eloquent words and fascinating stories make it an absolute delight to read.  \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" will make you laugh and cry.  It may even help you understand your mother, and your other relationships as well.  This novel does the best thing a novel can do; it helps you to understand the world.
0395925037|4.0|Hitler is often refered to as satan or crazy, but was he?  There is no denying that he along with the Nazi party killed many million Jews and other groups but to judge him as an intellectual squarly on his actions is harsh.  If one reads this book and takes the time to let it sink in, he or she will soon realize that this man was extremely intellectual.  He was not evil, possesed by the devil, or satanic in anyway but just wanted better.  It is said in this book that all he wants is a better life for the people of his race.  Although he took this to an extreme in killing other races, he had a good idea.  He just wanted a prospering community without hunger or violence.  Wrongly, Hitler chose to make his dream by denying basic human rights to others.  I am not a Nazi nor do I glorify Hitler in any way, but if one truly takes the time to listen, he or she might learn the other side of the one-sided story taught to us in school.

0142000655|4.0|Steinbeck incorporates a number of biblical themes in his novel, East Of Eden. I strongly recommend  readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible. Biblical themes set aside; the plot of the novel is entirely captivating. The binds of brotherhood and family are constantly tested and the reader is able to witness firsthand how important personal values contribute to one's success in life.
B00000AFGM|4.0|A diverse album. 5 stars for lyrics and meaning. Includes the popular ones: Dope Show, Rock is Dead, I Don't Like the Drugs (but the drugs like me) New Model No.15, and User Friendly. Awesome songs. All the songs are works of art, I guess it depends what kind of mood you are in. I just think Manson sounds best when he is rocking, not doing a ballad. There are a few too many slower songs on here. I guess I just wish there were more rockers. On the other hand, be sure to read all the lyrics and you will clearly see Manson's message. We are the Mechanical Animals living in the conformity of religious hypocracy. His message is to wake up and fight to re-kindle our lost free will. Stop letting brain numbing TV raise our children and form our thinking. The man is a genius and more of a prophet then we, or he, probably realize.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I'm with these other folks.  I don't get the hype.  Her vocals and interpretations aren't that remarkable.  The only thing I did like was the recording quality - not a lot of production, very minimal and sparse.  However, I dont think that's worth the price of the record.  Try Diana Krall, or Bebel Gilberto.  I seriously doubt anyone will remember these covers after the dust settles.
B00005U4UV|5.0|I watched this in cinema many many years before, and watched this movie recently on DVD.  I may have watched this for >10 times, on LD, VHS.....still this is a real great horror movie.  It lost a little bit of shock, but still I am amazed by the dark humor, and the way the story tells, and its explicit gore and sex scene.  A must for everyone, not just horror fan!
B00006690G|4.0|And here it is...the long awaited follow up to The Marshall Mather LP, and does it live up to it's hype? well, sort of. This is somewhat of a topsy-turvy record that has it's great points and it's not so great points. First off, let me say that the \\"skits\\" on the cd are terrible. Just plain terrible. Obviously not thought out at all and thrown together, sloppily. But you don't buy the cd for the skits right? Here is a rundown of the songs: (5 stars being the best, 1 the worst)<br />White America: A great song with a good beat. An excellent rap by Eminem and some thought provoking lyrics. 3 1/2 stars<br />Business: One of the best songs on the record. A great catchy beat and chorus and some excellent raps to boot. 4 1/2 stars<br />Cleaning Out My Closet: An emotional trip through eminem's life. Very well rapped and a great beat. Another one of the best songs on the record. 4 stars<br />Square Dance: By far, the worst song on the record. This song feels very sloppy and rushed. Not very catchy at all and the raps are sub-par for slim. 1 star<br />Soldier: A great song. Emotional and solid. Great raps and an overall great feel to it. 4 stars<br />Say Goodbye Hollywood: A very different song for eminem. Exploring some other aspects of hip hop here. Comes off a bit weird but good none-the-less. 3 1/2 stars<br />Drips: Probably the second worst song on the album. Sloppy. 1 1/2 stars<br />Without Me: Probably the best song on the record overall. (I guess that's why he released it as his first single off it) Fantastic beats, outstanding raps, a great song. 4 1/2 stars<br />Sing for the Moment: A very interesting twist on the \\"Aerosmith\\" song Dream On. Eminem has some solid raps in this one and the beat is great for the verses. I think the song loses a little bit in the chorus, but overall, a good song with some meaningful lyrics. 4 stars<br />Superman: I am editing my opinion of this song because it has grown on me in a huge way. I now can't stop listening to it. 4 stars.<br/>Hailie's Song: This is a great song except for the fact that eminem can't sing. (He says he can't in the song) but that doesn't take away from the fact that he really can't sing. at all. The song has a nice beat and the lyrics are emotional, but overall, not nearly his best effort. 3 stars<br />When the Music Stops: An overall good song with some guest appearences (namely, Bizarre from D12) Some good raps and a solid beat. 3 1/2 stars<br />Say What You Say: Now here is my biggest disappointment with the record. I was looking forward to this song a lot when I found out that Dre was going to be rapping on it and the fact that it was going to be a JD diss (I hate JD)but this song just comes up short. The beat is choppy and rushed and em's and Dre's raps could be much better. Not terrible but nowhere near great. 2 1/2 stars<br />Till I Collapse: One of my favorite songs on the album. It has a \\"We will Rock You\\" feel to it but comes off sounding good. Em has some solid raps and the overall feel of the song is solid. 4 stars<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy: Wacky! This song is pretty funny with Eminem's Daughter (I assume it's em's daughter, I could be wrong)providing the chorus. It sounds crazy but grows on you, and the rest of the track is solid. 4 stars<br />Well, that's my rundown of the \\"Eminem Show\\" Overall I would say that's it's a good record but not as good as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\"

0142000655|5.0|Steinbeck's East of Eden is a book that truly captures humanity in its desires in love and impulses in hatred. Everyone has the choice to choose good over evil. Cal portrays such a life of struggles between being good and being bad, and ultimately, it will be his own choice to give up or triumph. Timshel.<br />Steinbeck also depicts the importance of family. Love is essential, or else it becomes dysfunctional and treacherous. As Adam should have learned, brother will turn on brother for the love of his father. Sibling rivalry adds to the reenactment of Cain and Able.<br />East of Eden really sends a message that hits home at the heart. The character personalities are so real and relatable. It ranges at extreme opposites: from pure ignorance in Aron to profound understanding in Lee, from evil contempt in Cathy to loving care in Samuel.  It makes us explore our own standings. East of Eden exhibits great awareness of all humankind and is such a truly captivating and inspiring book.
B00006690F|5.0|On the DVD, Eminem talks about how his music grows and changes with him and he always intends to make cd's with better music than the last.  And this definitely shows on this DVD!  I'm a huge fan of Eminem and I love all his cd's, but this one by far is the best!!  Awesome!  The lyrics are great, the beats are tight, and the issues Eminem discusses are intense and deeply controversial (hey, that's what he does best)!  On the DVD, he also says how his fans have to defend themselves more than any other fan base and that's definitely true.  I'm constantly having to defend my reasons for loving his music so much, but it's all worth it!  With music like this, how could you not like him?  Enjoy!
B000007R1M|2.0|I'm afraid that any Kraftwerk record I hear after Radio-Activity is going to be a disappointment. This basically sounds similar to the style of Computer World and Trans Europe Express; it has that cold, angular sound the group is known for (and which I usually do enjoy.) As is made obvious by the album and song titles, cold and angular is the entire point... they aimed well and hit the mark. But if you're looking for some classic electronic music that actually has warmth and soul, Kraftwerk's 1975 album Radio-Activity is the one you want.
B00005JKJA|5.0|MD is not for the average movie-goer - it's for the F I L M aficionado, C I N E M A culture vulture.  <br />Lynch begins the journey with Diane (on her bed) and ends it with Diane.  This is the simplest explanation for the fork in the road you seemed to have missed when first watching this flick.  Without giving too much away, yet still peaking your interest to watch MD, Lynch spins his web so thick you need a broom to get through it.  He portrays 4 characters with 2 actors.  You may think your secret decoder ring isn't working at first but give it time.  Is it all Diane's fantasy/invention, the crafty work of the THERE'S A MAN BEHIND THIS PLACE, I CAN SEE HIM THROUGH THE WALLS AND HE'S DOING IT, or just making a film in LA with different actors auditioning for various parts and the director trying them out to see who fits where and scenes filmed unchrono with deleted scenes kept in the movie?  You decide. <br />Don't look for help from Lynch.  After all, according to his bio on the DVD, he's simply a former Scout.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I read the books - they were a 10<BR>Saw the movie - it was about an 8<BR>Bought the DVD - it is a 2 <BR>why a 2 - Never before seen footage does not exist!<br />   the box clearly states - See Never before seen footage
B00006690F|4.0|Don't believe the hype: Eminem's newest disc isn't going to save hip-hop.  It's a good record, that's for sure - but it's not as good as 2000's phenominal \\"Marshall Mathers LP.\\"  Eminem's lyrics are as sharp as ever, but too many of the beats sound similar.  Don't be fooled: Dr. Dre may be the \\"executive producer\\" of the disc but he only gets behind the recording desk on 3 of this album's 20 tracks.  This is not a groundbreaking album, but's still a pretty good one by one of today's top MC's.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie rocks. A movie that will stick with you and to feel proud to be an American. The special affects and cinemetagraphy was awesome. This movie was the best of the best.
B00006690F|5.0|If you have heard the latest Eminem song Without Me; you know he's back and better than before. With his \\"explicit lyircs\\" you'll be blown out of your mind with amazement. Critics everywhere say this CD is great and I'll have to agree wiht them for this one. This is not one of those CD's with only five good songs and you skip the rest, this CD is composed of only good songs. His six year old daughter has a part in this CD where she sings the chorus to the most relaxed song in the CD before Eminem just goes back to his old self with the hard core music he's famous for. So be sure not to pass off this CD it's worth your time, trust me.
B00005IC2H|4.0|Reports suggest that Sigur Ros is from Iceland, but if they ended up being from Pluto, or some far off galaxy, it wouldn't be surprising. Nor would it make any difference. Agaetis Byrjun, a hypnotic siren song of an album, glides in as if delivered by an advanced alien civilization. Warmer and fuller than any of Radiohead's attempts at moody, ambient music, Agaetis Byrjun would suggest the future of music if you actually believed anyone else on earth was talented enough to replicate its unique sound (no one is). <br />After a beautiful appetizer of an intro, the album goes right into the epic \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\" (try saying that 10 times fast), 10 minutes that may as well last a lifetime. It sounds like a submarine maneuvering through a newly discovered celestial body. Relaxing, powerful, and touching all at once, it sets the tone for the rest of what follows. \\"Staralfur\\" follows, a track as hopeful as a newborn child's birth. Listening to it is as cathartic as My Bloody Valentine's shimmering wave of feedback from ten years ago. After the demise (or hibernation) of that band, it's wonderful to see a new band trying to bring rock music to an entirely different level. <br />Scared of the language barrier? Don't be. Like any opera, the emotion comes through regardless of whether or not you can understand the words. From the dazzle of \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\" to the Celtic waterfall of \\"Olsen Olsen,\\" Sigur Ros bursts with feelings of hope, despair, happiness, sadness, and all points in between, perhaps even creating new emotions as they go along. It's an incredible achievement, not likely to be matched by anybody anytime soon. Unless you count the band itself, but they may have moved on to another solar system by then.
B00006690F|5.0|What can I say about Eminem that hasn't been said already? I will say that, no matter how you feel about him, he is one of the few popular artists today who is unflinchingly honest with his fans. He lays his personal life out for everyone to examine, which at times is hard to listen to. The best example on this album is \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\". He didn't just write this song to blast on his Mom, you can feel the pain in his voice even when he's saying something cruel. If you've ever had a serious rift in your relationship with your parent(s), this one will bring tears to your eyes. Of course, this is in no way the only good song on the album, just the one that hit me the hardest. I am twenty-five, with two boys of my own, so it gets to me. And I certainly don't need to base my musical selections on whether or not it'll offend my parents, as one reviewer stated earlier. I'd like to think I, and many of Em's fans, are  past that kind of thing. Anyway, other songs that are especially good: \\"White America\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Without Me\\", (of course) and \\"Hailie's Song\\". Eminem will probably not be around forever, but he's certainly made his mark, in my opinion.
B000002UA2|3.0|As with all Pink Floyd albums of the early 70's, the instrumentals are the best part of Obscured by Clouds. The first two tracks set up a really oppressive mood, while \\"Mudmen\\" exercises emotions in a way simillar to \\"The Great GIg in the Sky.\\" \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" is the best song on the album, though. It creates a really creepy atmosphere, then mixes in a chant done by a New Guinean tribe. While all these instrumental masterpieces are great, the regular songs just don't cut it. \\"Burning Bridges\\" is a boring, less passionate version of \\"Mudmen.\\" \\"Free Four,\\"  and \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" are way too poppy for their own good. \\"Wot's...Um The Deal\\" is a tiring repeat of \\"Brain Damage\\" (which was already written when the Floyd recorded this, while \\"Stay\\" is a sad attempt by Rick Wright to write another great emotional song like \\"Summer '68\\" The only song with lyrics worth listening to is \\"Childhood's End,\\" but \\"The Narrow Way\\" and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" are still far superior Gilmour efforts. I wouldn't reccomend that new Floyd fans eager to hear early songs that weren't on Echoes buy this. Instead, get More, Ummagumma, or Atom Heart Mother.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This album has come to mean A LOT to me. Every time I'm going through any kind of emotion, I can put this cd and feel better. That is what wonderful music does. On my flustrated days, I listen to \\"Just Like a Pill\\" or \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" a lot. They both are really deep. On sad days, \\"Eventually\\" is what I listen to. These three are my favorites, but the whole album is wonderful! I love the title track, Numb, Family Portrait, My Vietnam, Misery, 18 Wheeler. I Love them all!! It's very rare that I find an album where I can listen to the whole thing. This has become one of my favorite albums of all time. Catch her on tour. I've seen her twice and she's awesome!! I Love You Pink!!
B00003CXI0|2.0|Harry Potter is all about magic, but there's precious little of it in this pedestrian, unimaginative movie version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; As some other reviewers point out, certain key scenes have been changed or deleted, but I can't really complain. If Chris Columbus was to slog us through even more of Hogwarts and environs, it would be unbearable. It's difficult to explain how a director can take a wonderful book, great characters and a huge budget and still come up with almost nothing worth watching. Everything seems rote--Harry is blah and uninteresting, Hermoine is shrill and deeply irritating, Draco Malfoy is utterly unthreatening and the great British actors have nothing to do. The most appealing character is Ron Weasley who actually shows some emotion and energy in a few of his scenes. Hagrid also is heads above the others (excuse the pun). What can I say? It's a great disappointment--I had been waiting for six months to see this film in English. Hope the next one is better, and maybe they ought to look around for a new director--one who isn't such an awful muggle.
B000006E17|2.0|Call it what you will; this film is not only the most perverse and depraved picture of humanity I've ever seen, but it may also be the most DANGEROUS film ever made in its depiction of what people in power are capable of. I felt as if I were in a state of suspended animation during its 2-hour run (I spent most of the time open-mouthed in disbelief as I watched, then felt like a pervert after it ended).  I don't see \\"Salo\\" so much as a commentary on Fascism as much as it is a kick-in-the-stomach view of just how vile the human race can be, has been and still is. As other viewers have remarked, it's like entering the sickest nightmare, a slow descent into Hell; the depravity and decadence is beyond belief. Yet I can see why some viewers might see parts of it as a sick comedy, if for no other reason but to distance ourselves from the horror of what we are watching. As far as equating the film with \\"art\\", I recall only the elegance of the interiors and how that beauty clashes in counterpoint with the base goings-on. But does that make it art? I hardly think so. (Oddly, for all of its realism, strange shots appeared, at least in my copy...the last scene looked as if it suddenly turned into Claymation!) I don't see the film as art. I see it as the horrifying spectacle it is, and only worthwhile as a disturbing reminder of the preciousness of freedom. To reiterate again as other reviews have, THIS FILM IS NOT FOR THE EASILY-UPSET.
B000062TU1|1.0|They surely knew how to advertise this movie. There were less special effects than I expected. The movie is incredibly slow and long. It is easy to get bored. I expected Harry to do more spells and \\"witchy\\" work, but it was Hermione who did just few spells. Since Harry was a \\"natural\\" I expected more action but it was more like a quest for something movie. It was like if you were watching Zelda made in a movie. I was truly disappointed.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I was a little unsure about all the previews but the film blew me away. Never before had i seen more amazing stunt and effect work at this level for this type action movie. I thought that the story was dead on and the race scenes off the meter. you can't help but give props to the cast, crew and director for taking such a risk with this inovative film subject.
B00005K3OT|4.0|This is a movie which transfers well onto DVD. It is a lovely movie which uses chocolate as its theme to bring across other issues of the time and of its location. Although Johnny Depp looked delicious in the movie, for some reason, I felt he was mis-casted in the role. Juliette Binoche however, was absolutely ravishing as the chocolatier who brought this sinful sweet treat to this pious town completely smothered by misery due to its mayor played by Alfred Molina.<BR>I've watched this 3 times already and know that I will watch it again sometime in the future. This is a food lovers' movie just like \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\", \\"Babette's Feast\\" and \\"Big Night\\".
B000000H64|5.0|For those of you who do not know FF....FF consists of beastlike growls but still melodios vocals of Burton C Bell.........Precise beats and lightning fast double bass of Raymond Herrera who in my opinion is a robot........you can't be that fast............He's certainly the best drummer in the world alongside Igor Cavalera of Sepultura.The bass is handled by Christian Olde Wolbers on this album and the ones to follow.The bass is fairly loud but very unique which gives FF it's unique sound....as if the songs have been done by machines.Dino Cazares does the guitars.This guy is the best riff guitarist in the world alongside Stephen Carpenter of the Deftones.<BR>Now the album...............this is fear factory's second major album. Now FF has been in a habit of doing something different in all their albums and still they come out brilliantly each time. The first album(Soul Of A New Machine)was sort of futuristic death metal.........the third album \\"OBSOLETE\\" was a hybrid of \\"demanufacture\\" and \\"Soul of a new machine\\") where as the fourth(digimortal) is a heavier version of nu-metal.<BR>Demaufacture is the best FF album cuz it's different....u can't classify it........i'd like to call it \\"fear factory metal\\". This album is sort of patented......as if ff have a copyright on it......it's very unique.<BR>The tracks on the album are:<BR>(1)Demanufacture:hard and heavy........burton growls and screams while dino,christian and raymond create mayhem.(5/5)<BR>(2)Self bias Resistor:great chorus ,awesome drums good guitars.(5/5)<BR>(3)Zero signal:even greater chorus.......great guitars and drums.......haunting bass.(5/5)<BR>(4)Replica:best track on the album........greatest chorus ever to be........checkout the drumming in the end.The main riff is really good.FF released a video for this song.This was the first song i heard on the album on mp3....then i brought it.(i would like to give this song 6 on 5).<BR>(5)New Breed:good hard song(4/5)<BR>(6)Dog Day Sunrise:this is a cover....i didn't like this song much but many do....you might like it.(3/5)<BR>(7)Body Hammer:again not great.(3/5)<BR>(8)Flashpoint:really hard and aggressive song.(5/5)<BR>(9)H-K:Hard song with great vocals and guitars.(5/5)<BR>(10)Pisschrist:another good song but not an anthem like replica or self bias resistor.(4/5)<BR>(11)A Therapy for Pain:nice way to end the album.the song is soft and soothes your ears after the assault your ear drums have just had. <BR>   over all........great album.....you must buy this if you like deftones,sepultura and soulfly.
6305910189|5.0|After the disappointing release of Star Trek:The Motion Picture, \\"The Wrath Of Kahn\\" was a great delight to see.<br />Filled with action, adventure and darma. All perfomances, even William Statner's were incredible. Spock and McCoy were finally Spock and McCoy. The Enterprise finally had color and lights and the unforms were more space fairing then the pajamas in the first one.<br />Nicholas Meyer, who I met shortly after this production in the 80's, described this as an adventure will characters moving the story and drama not the special effects. There's energy, humor, drama and even death.<br />The Genesis Device proves to be an icon for the whole underling story. And, as far as special effects go, in 1982 - they were the best. Visual candy for the eye.<br />Cudos to the supporting cast (espeically Deforest \\"McCoy\\" Kelly and James \\"Scotty\\" Doohan) and of corse Ricardo \\"Kahn\\" Mauntalban - there's an actors, actor. Even the Goodbye scene for Shatner and Nimoy (Spock) was heartfelt and real.<br />This is my second favorite of the Star Trek features. (USed to be the first until Star Trek IV:The Voyage Home!) Warp speed this one into your collection! (The original trailers are fun to watch too!)
0060977264|2.0|This book was most unfortunate. The author just wanted to shove spirituality and religion down my throat. I liked the last 25 pages or so very much, but the entire first portion of the book was painful to read. The protagonist/narrator was boring and I mostly just wanted to smack her rather than identify with her problems and the like. The book tried to be really deep, yet it was very forced and unsuccessful, I think. Maybe I'm just too jaded and/or cynical for this genre of book.
0316286850|5.0|Kevyn Aucion is a true artist. He transforms people to the point where they look like a totally different person, in a good way! I wish I had his gift. He also gives step by step instructions on how to duplicate each look in real life. I love it!
B00006690F|5.0|just forget all the hype around the man...listen to his words...this man is, for a lack of a bette word, brillant,...forget the critics...listen to what eminem has to say...b/c he speaks alot of truths...that is why i rate this 5 stars....because he puts his heart into his work...this is a good cd..
0812550706|5.0|i was recommended to read this book and i did. i was not disappointed by the writing and the story. Orson Scott Card does a wonderful job building up the story, and gives a nice twist at the end that, to me, felt unexpected but wonderful. <br />a great read for kids of all ages.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|All I can say is Bravo Disney!<br />The interactifve menus alone are worth this DVD.<br />Very visual, very creative. Very funny.<br />The extras and Documentaries are fascinating and detailed. Your host Roy E. Disney and Angela Landsbury are fun.<br />I must have watched this 50 times already!
B00006690F|5.0|I have been listening to this cd for days now and I still love it. The original and fantastic beats mixed with his original rhymes make this a very original cd that is quite entertaining. It also has a lot more heart that many of the cd's over the last few years. You can feel what he is saying. So overall this is an awesome cd that for me is a must own.
B00005Q45W|2.0|I have been a Leonard Cohen fan for most of my life (started listening to him on public radio at 11) and his next-to-last album, The Future, took me by storm. I love all the tracks; they're quintessentially Cohen, but at the same time innovative and, for him, experimental. I was terribly excited to find out where he would go from there. It now appears that The Future will have to tide me over for longer than the decade I've so far been waiting.<BR>Ten New Songs is, to say the least, not what I was hoping for. Yes, they're obviously his lyrics, and yes, that's his voice, but the rest of the album has been hijacked by this Sharon Robinson person, who has put enough of herself into it (including a cover photo -- what's up with that?) that I feel personally betrayed. I desperately want to feel no negative emotions about any work from my favorite singer/songwriter, but I can't help but feel when listening to this album that she's using his talent to try to make a name for herself. I can't abide by it. I will continue to try my best to fall in love, just a little bit, with this album, but I can't help but wonder: is it closing time for Leonard?
0451197968|5.0|This is Stephen King's second best book, behind only The Stand. This is a superbly written action story. it has a great plot, moves quickly and draws you in to this nightmare like no one else can. the book does start out a bit slowly, but picks up tremendously, ending with one explosive (literally) ending! <br />Don't watch the movie--you know the one with Ahnold! in it, because it was terrible. the adaptation screwed up the story. i wish that someone would do a true movie adaptation of this Stephen King masterpiece.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I used to call this the &quot;Motionless Picture&quot;. I am a big fan of Star Trek and I saw it in the theatre when it premiered in 1979, but except for the &quot;Tour Around The ENTERPRISE&quot; the V'ger Story fell short for me.<br />Sure it was exciting seeing everyone back and being introduced again, but the STory was not original and very boring - espeically the V'Ger fly-by's. Yuch.<br />Now the Directors DVD edition is out and it is much better. Better images, enhanced and added scenes and the commentaries are really good.<br />The DVD didn't change the overall film, but it definately works better on the small screen and the directors edition is worth it. Keep on Trekkin'!
0393317552|5.0|Guns, Germs and Steel provides a really great comparison between different socities development through time looking at how and why certain peoples were able to conquer other people. It also how cultures developed or failed to by looking at things like culture, religion, geography, techonological diffusion, political structure, plant and animal life and so forth. It goes through history to explain how various factors influenced human development through time. Overall, it helps add a lot to one's understanding of world history.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie part of this DVD is great.  The quality is terrific and the special effects don't look quite as fake as they did in the movie theater.<br />On the downside, the \\"Special Features\\" DVD is a disappointment.  In order to access the deleted scenes, you have to go through an intricate and frustrating set of exercises -- every single time.  Fine if you're into video games -- but if all you want is to see the seven scenes (and there are too few in my opinion), it's a pain.  It's great to have a game, but it would be easier for this non-video-game-playing-person to have it separated from the other features and that way, everything can be enjoyed. (Although I must admit to a certain amount of excitement when I passed Potions, made my way to the Stone and finally saw those anxiously awaited deleted scenes.)<br />On the plus side, there are some amusing film bits on many of the characters sprinkled throughout the interactive section. Another is that the interview with Chris Columbus, the producer and screenwriter is easily accessible.<br />I do not have a DVD-ROM drive and so cannot comment on those aspects -- I'm sure much is hidden there.<br />Given the broad spectrum of extras that so many DVD's offer, this has fallen a bit short of my own expectations.<br />But, there will still be hours of enjoyment to be had at Hogwarts.
0451196716|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever written. even though the plot is pretty simple, Stephen King does not bore us during the three hundred or so mile walk that these boys are competing in. Plus, i like walking, so i understood what it was like to go on long walks.
B00004RE7D|4.0|Needless to say Leonard Nimoy's feature film directorial debut was supurb. A very techinical film - it has the gloomy tragic Shakespearean qualities to it that a good drama should. Deep, deep stuff.<br />Christopher Llod (Doc Brown of \\"Back To The Future I, II, & III\\") fame, is a brilliant villan. Evil and cunning - he thwarts Kikr many times.<br />Good does triumph over evil in this one, but there is a valuable cost as Kirk and cCrew find out. This is the detsruction of the original Enterprise (refurbished) and much more.<br />There is great comedy in this film too. Uhura gets an 'eager beaver', scotty stops up the plumbing and Sulu shows his prowess to being insulted.<br />Also the sets are interesting and fun to watch. you have gun fights and wrestling but most important is the concept of friendship.<br />Again the story is the focus and the effect the iceing on the cake. Leonard Nimoy really does take you ..'Where No Man Has GOne Before'.....death and beyond.<br />Great for kids and adults. Beam me up!
B00006690F|5.0|It's amazing how far Eminem has come since that \\"My Name Is\\" shocked the world over 3 years ago. Each one of his albums is better than the previous, and \\"The Eminem Show\\" is no exception. Shady grows out of the constant dissing and bashing found in his first two albums and comes with 15 songs with strong lyrics. This guy has proven that he is an extremely talented artist with great rhymin' skills. \\"Without Me\\" is the only goofy-toned song on the entire album, and the mix of harder and lighter stuff gives the entire album a great tone the whole way through.
0345413377|4.0|The adventures started in The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife for Lyra and Will continue in The Amber Spyglass.  Accompanied by two minor angels, Baruch and Balthamos, Will sets out to rescue Lyra from her captivity at the hands of an unknown kidnapper.  It is on these two children, from two different but parallel universes, that the futures of all of the universes lie.  Not everyone, however, believes that these children are there to save the universe.  The Church believes Lyra will commit a sin that will destroy the universes forever, and they are out to find her before she can commit that sin.  Ms. Coulter, Lyra's mother, seems torn between supporting the Church or helping her daughter.  Lord Asriel, Lyra's father, has started gathering forces at his mountain fortress to resist the angel Metatron, Reagent of the Kingdom of Heaven, who is frustrated by his lack of physical substance and plans to take it out on the masses of physical beings in the Universes.  Meanwhile, Dr. Mary Malone has made a horrible discovery in another parallel universe; the magical Dust that has been keeping conscious thought alive in the universes is disappearing at an alarming rate!  The tension keeps building as more layers of complexity are revealed and the plots start becoming intertwined.  It is a page-turner from start to finish.<br />     In this third and final book of the His Dark Materials series, Philip Pullman pulls a mind twister out of his creative bag.  The entire series, but this book in particular, will really get your mind gears turning as you try to figure out what is going to happen next.  Pullman is a master of foreshadowing with subtle clues.  Pullman also makes the plot interesting by not giving away too much at once.  By leaving out key information in conversations between the characters and ending conversations with statements such as, \\"And Will knew what he needed to do,\\" Pullman entices the reader to keep reading to find out what happens next.  This made thebook extremely interesting to read and I would highly recommend it to those fantasy enthusiasts looking for another series to read. However, this is not a book I would recommend if you are just looking for something to read over the weekend, as this book is difficult to understand unless you have read the other two books in the series and have become familiar with the characters and concepts.
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a marvelous, and long overdue, treat for LEGEND and Jerry Goldsmith fans. This film was the second time in which a Goldsmith score for a Ridley Scott film was sliced and diced. (His original score for ALIEN, edited for that film's commercial release, was restored as an alternate audio track for the ALIEN collector's edition DVD.)<br /><br />Here, his score is restored to the film, along with several scenes that were edited from either the US or both US and international versions. The first disc is a sort of \\"final\\" director's cut version that comes close to Scott's 113 minute first cut. (Example: Lily's early vision of a cuckoo clock freezing amid snow was in the US version but NOT the international release version. It's in this \\"final\\" version.) My own favorite missing snippet, Robert (Star Trek: Voyager) Picardo's full scene as Meg Mucklebones, is also restored. I remember seeing the full scene in US theatres, and missing it on the VHS releases. Other clumsy edits are also corrected, such as Darkness' first appearance in the film (or lack thereof - he's shown like Blofeld, hidden in a chair), which in the US version featured silly \\"glow\\" effects and lighting that didn't even match the rest of the scene. (Further \\"version\\" information can be found on IMDB's listing for LEGEND, under Alternate Versions.) Disc 2 features the shorter US version with Tangerine Dream soundtrack, for those who want that.<br /><br />In all, the restored director's cut, and several tasty extras, on this 2-disc set make it well worth the price for fans. Included are a work print introduction scene that was ultimately abandoned, and a restoration of the Faerie's Dance, which was cut and subsequently lost. For non-fans, LEGEND remains a visually stunning live action rendition of a faerie tale. More than a little scary for young `uns, but still magical for adults with a sense of wonder. The movie's stars are almost secondary (save for lovely, young Mia Sara) to the virtuoso turns by supporting players, led by David Bennant. I wish Scott would return to his contemplative filmmaking like BLADE RUNNER, THE DUELLISTS and LEGEND. LEGEND is an example of a director in full command of his craft.s, led by David Bennant.

6303014100|5.0|This is such an excellent production and I've watched it several times. I particularly appreciate it as an Art Historian of American Art: I can't believe someone actually took the time to research paintings of the Civil War and the Revolution! <br />There are two scenes in particular that really impressed me:<br />--the death of Reynolds is a pieta scene taken right out of Benjamin West's \\"Death of Wolfe\\". (Notice how they manage to sneak in the Red uniformed soldiers to make this scene: absolutely brilliant!)<br />--when Tom Chamberlain talks to the three Reb prisoners, that is pose-for-pose an exact duplication of Winslow Homer's \\"Prisoners from the Front.\\" Look it up and compare it!
B00006690F|2.0|I'm reading all these rave reviews here - \\"best ever??\\" - and<BR>I mean, I love his prior albums as much as anyone, and songs here on which he actually raps and rhymes such as Without Me and The Light are dope indeed, but these repetitive trifles like Hailie's Song, Soldier, Superman, Squaredance????   BO-RING!!!  It's like he couldn't come up with enough rhymes to fill an album, so just filled it with....filler.  Wake me when his next album comes out.

All those people who don't like the Stokes for stupid reasons like this...don't let the bloody hype control what you like. YES!

They have nice melodies and you can tell they're really into the rhythem of the songs. The Modern Age,Is This It (which alot of ppl don't like..but i don't care!) and Someday are the best tracks on here!
B00003CXI1|4.0|But, of course, not nearly as much as I love all of the books!<br />I was a little surprised by the \\"special feature\\" disc. Actually, I was a bit frustrated. The explore-and-discover format was an interesting concept, and a semi-enjoyable experience, but I'm afraid it may just annoy people who aren't Harry Potter fanatics. Those who just want to see the deleted scenes and be done with it.<br />The deleted scenes were good, though. I would love to eventually see a version of the movie with them integrated back in.
0425170349|3.0|&#65279;Tom Clancy writes a superb novel, complete with action, adventure, plot twists and<BR>social commentary.  Clancy takes the lives of several characters and intertwines them in a<BR>manner which awes its reading audience as the plot unravels, exposing the genius of Clancy and<BR>his ability to weave and unweave the lives of his characters.  A multinational counter-terrorist<BR>team has been assembled in Europe by top government officials in several countries.  This<BR>counter-terrorist force must complete missions with perfection every time, while still keeping<BR>their top secret identity top secret.

There is no bigger Beatle fan than I, but I must say I'm glad THE BEATLES ignored these songs.

Well worth the reasonable cost.  If you are capable of relaxing & taking in music for what it is, then you will love this.  And if you are really lucky \\"Joan and Molly' will 'sweep the stairs\\".

B00003CXI1|3.0|Sometimes promotional hype takes on a life of it's own and the actual merits of a film can be difficult to determine.<BR>If you knew nothing of Harry Potter books or the author and were grading this movie as simply that...a movie, it really doesn't stand up so well.<BR>What bugged me the most were the recycled ideas.  None of this material is in the least bit original.  It's just given a new hair cut and presented to an audience of children who are unaware of how much is borrowed from C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien and a slew of other authors.<BR>The film is overly long and doggedly loyal to the book, which offers up no surprises.  I had hoped that more children would have looked at this movie and realized it could have been much, much better.  As it is, there are some fun scenes, but they are hidden among more boring scenes.  I felt as though the movie was always building up to something that never arrived and then the credits rolled.
0780622553|4.0|I like stylish movies.  This movie has plenty of style to spare.  But what keeps me coming back to Dark City is the sense of mystery.  The story unravels in such a way that it never fails to creep me out, even though I know the surprise ending.  The main character has no idea how this mystery is going to end, and watching him desperately trying to figure it out is a pleasure.  That the final conflict isn't a plain old shootout is a bonus.  Strap on your thinking caps and have fun with it.
B000066F6H|5.0|... Anyway really good album allot of just 2 or 3 min tracks. If you are tired of clone bands .... My only fear with this band is that it has all the makings of a band that can really have an impact, or all the makings of a fad.
B000055Y0X|3.0|Critics across America call this one of the funniest comedies of all time.  It is funny, but I wouldn't say it's good for a belly laugh.  Sure, there are some chuckles here and there, but this is purely tongue-in-cheek humor.<BR>Example: Keenan Wynn's character tells (one of) Peter Sellers character(s) that he'll have to answer to the Coca Cola Company for shooting the lock off the Coke machine's change collector in order to pay for the phone call that may stop the nuclear holocaust.  \\"That's private property!\\" he says.  That's the flavor of the humor here.  It's all very tongue-in-cheek, social commentary, like what you might find in a Dave Barry article or by some nut on the newspaper editorial page.<BR>   Peter Sellers is wonderful in three very different roles, and George C. Scott is a hoot.  But, again, nothing hilarious here.  It's good for a chuckle, though, and the DVD has plenty of features to keep the movie fans busy.  This movie isn't for everyone.  But then, what is?
B00005JHAD|4.0|Snatch got plenty of bad reviews when it came out and didn't seem much like my type of movie anyway, but I found it immensly entertaining and funny.  The insane, convoluted story and wonky editing were all part of the experience, the violence was frequently hilarious, and the characters were great.  I laughed as much as anyone at Brad Pitt's ridiculous oirish accent, but I loved his character, and felt that it wouldn't be half as good with decent diction.  And I felt that Vinnie Jones was the best of the bunch as the always somewhat bored looking gangster who is totally unfazed by anything.
B00003CXI1|3.0|When the fourth book was released to so much hype, I wondered what it was about and made my way to the library.  I was completely hooked.  I'm 26 and don't have any kids, but I own all of the books, saw the movie in the theatre 3 time (in three differnt countries), and bought the DVD the day it came out.  The movie itself is a great way to see the stuff I've imagined in my head.  It stays faithful to the book, but doesn't really add anything.  I almost always like the books better than the movies that are created from them, but there is usually something in the movie that is better than in the book.  I didn't really find that with Harry Potter.  But, this is still a movie worth owning.  The acting is for the most part wonderful.  I hope they can convince all of the actors to stay with this series to the end.  It would be a shame to suddenly have a new Hagrid in part 4.<br />My biggest complaint with the DVD is how much work the second disk is.  I really wanted to see the 7 extra scenes, but they're not a menu listing anywhere on the DVD.  I haven't figured it out yet because I haven't gone to all of the menu items.  It might be fun for kids to navigate through all of this stuff, but I just want to see the scenes!  J.K. Rowling did a wonderful job of making her books appeal to both kids and adults; the DVD makers should have done the same thing.<br />My last comment is on the critism Harry Potter gets for being about witchcraft and wizardry.  Anyone who opposes Harry Potter for being evil or non-Christian has obviously not read the books or has only taken them at face value.  The stories really don't revolve around Harry being a wizard so much as they deal with Harry finding a place where he belongs.  And this is something that every kid deals with.
B000002J09|4.0|I believe that \\"stairway to heaven\\" is one of the most excellently crafted songs in the history of rock n' roll. Musically, it was an all-time high for the band, Bonham never sounded better, and Page constructed superior arrangements. I read that John Bonham actually took four drumsticks, two in each hand, and started banging on the drums for what became \\"Four Sticks\\". Anyway, I think this is a decent album and that the epic, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", pretty much set the style for the later metal songs of Metallica and Pantera.
B000007VCM|5.0|I'll take a different route seeing the many splendid reviews of this great album, and focus on my discovery of the band. And yes, it was through the \\"Love\\" album. I remember sometime in early '86 seeing a video of \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" at a club in New York City after seeing, I presume, a heavy metal concert. (I was mainly into HM/HR and punk back then.) The singer reminded me a bit of Steven Tyler, and because of that was immediately drawn to the band. And that song -- brilliant and just hard enough for my HM/punk sensibilities. A few months later I took a gamble and brought the album not knowing what I was in for on the strength of the song and video I had seen -- by this time on a number of occasions at the same club. (And to think I had missed the band playing at that same club in Dec. of '85 and a few months later at another well-known establishment in NYC! Do not even get me started on how I missed out on a secret gig they played at another NYC club in late '86. Oh well, I at least have the video portion of the 12/85 gig.) Words cannot express what I discovered upon hearing \\"Love\\" repeatedly. It not only was a brilliant record, but helped me in rediscovering my roots in new wave, post-punk (or whatever neat term one might have for late 70's/early 80's music) before plunging straight into HM/HR/Punk and hardly looking back. While every song was more or less a gem, the songs that I recall standing out most were \\"Brother Wolf...\\" (I'd be curious if the band was inspired by a poem from St. Francis of Assisi), \\"Dark Angel\\", \\"Hollow Man\\", and \\"The Phoenix\\". Good heavens, this album had it all: great songs, stellar production values, and that quintessential magic that makes music a proper vehicle to carry us mortals to otherworldly heights. Pardon the pun, but nirvana indeed ladies and gentlemen! To my delight the following year, I picked up - like I did the Lp version - the import CD and discovered the likes of \\"Little Face\\" and \\"Judith\\". (I had seen the titles on the import 12\\" singles, but up until then I had never heard the other non-LP tracks.) To this day, alongside \\"Dreamtime\\", it is in my all-time Top 10 list. Two discs I cannot be without if I were stranded on a desert island. While I more or less liked <BR>\\"Electric\\" and the subsequent tour for that album (the same goes for \\"Sonic Temple\\"), something was missing. Since the Cult, in my opinion, haven't much changed their hard rock sound (with the exception of the self-titled record from '94), I tend to feel that they could have toned down the \\"crunchiness\\" and gone for a more \\"Love\\" inspired sound. It was the former that steadily drew away the earlier fans if anyone remembers that far back and has followed the band throughout the years. All in all, an absolute gorgeous album that still sounds fresh all these years later.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I love harry potter. I own all the books, and never got to see it in the theater. Instead, I bought it when it first came out on DVD. I knew it was going to  be wonderful and it was. The sets, the music, the acting... all lived up and surpassed my expectations. This is a wonderfully magical movie with just the right combination of movie elements. The characters are real, the storyline (while adapted from the book) is solid and everything flows so well that you forget it's a two hour movie. Even the special effects worked for the movie instead of being over the top. Watching the movie, I giggled and smiled and felt as if I was 5 again.<br />My only complaint on this DVD set is that I own a Macintosh and the PC-DVD specials are NOT compatible with Mac drives. Actually, this set includes \\"bonus footage\\" that is no where to be seen on either disc when loaded into the drives. I presume it's part of the PC-DVD section. This did bum me out as I was looking forward to watching those bonus scenes. Because of this, I gave it 4 stars.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I bought this DVD b/c I liked the movie and was looking forward to seeing the deleted scenes and other extras. This DVD, however has some of the most irritating special features of any I own.  When I pay money for a DVD, I don't expect to have to navigate through pointless extras to see the deleted scenes. Most of them aren't even that interesting (flavored jellybeans, poorly produced tour of Hogwarts, etc.) I still have yet to spend the hours it takes to view the deleted scenes.  The only thing worth viewing, besides the movie, is the interview segment. If you are buying this DVD for the extras, be prepared for the frustration.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a fairy tale, a buddy picture, and a romantic comedy.  In short, this is a movie for just about everyone!  Shrek is an ogre (&quot;You know, grab your pictchforks!&quot;) who only wants to be left alone.  Too bad Lord Farquad wants all the Fairy Tale creatures out of his kingdom, and Shrek's swamp is the dumping ground for the evicted tenants.  Aided by a talking donkey (played wonderfully by Eddie Murphy), Shrek journies to Farquand's castle and gets roped into a quest.  Rescue a Princess for Farquad and he can get his swamp back.  Easier said than done.  Shrek is filled with humor (some of it a tad adult though, so parents should be warned) and emotion.  It even has a message (albeit one undercut by some of its own humor) worth hearing.  The dual disc allows you to see the movie either full frame or wide screen, and both are choke full of faux interviews with 'the cast', storyboards, games, music videos, and who knows what else (I haven't found any easter eggs, but I haven't looked).  Beware, you to might fall in love with Shrek!  Highly recommended.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is an unbelieveably passionate and thoughtful album.  My favorite song is Case of You (which was covered by Tori Amos).  This is a great album if you are looking for a starting point to get into Joni.
6305128952|5.0|This is a unique movie from the millions of others out there.  The plot starts with Grace(Scarlett Johansson) and her best friend meeting to go horse back riding and with Grace's mom Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) working hard in her magazine office. When the girls are riding a tramatic and tragic accident happens causing the death of Grace's best friend and severe injuries to both Grace and her horse Pilgrim. Grace's right leg is severely hurt so they must amputate it. With her daughter becoming more distant from the family and Pilgrim becoming more afraid of humans, Annie is desperate to find relief or an answer somewhere. She reads an article about a horse whisperer named Tom Booker (Robert Redford) who heals horses. Anxious to give it a try, Annie, Grace, and Pilgrim travel from their home in New York to a cattle ranch in Montana and begin Pilgrim's healing process while Grace's father stays behind. What no one expected was the love situation that would come about when Tom and Annie met. Combined with a teriffic plot and the beautiful Montana scenery, this is definitely a movie not to be missed.
0316921173|5.0|From the halfway house to the weelchair assasins to the enfield tennis academy, where marijuana is a way of life, \\"Infinite Jest\\" does nothing but satisfy.  A commentary on the sad state of american society and politics, \\"infinite jest\\" hits the mark, on all levels.  Highly recommended.
B00005R2M3|5.0|One of the best CD's I've purchased since buying CDs!!!!! Can't miss with this one - something for everyone.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I rarely buy new music, but I sought this CD out after hearing \\"Lone Star\\" on [the radio]  Folk or jazz , Norah delivers beautifully. At times a quiet work, \\"Come Away With Me\\"  is on balance a real testiment to the artist's appreciation of quality music and thoughtful delivery, and of course she is a talented musician herself.  This CD goes well with shiraz, by the way.
0738206679|5.0|In \\"Linked\\" we have a rare opportunity to listen to a gifted teacher use narrative examples to explain his efforts to understand how the web and the internet are networked and organized. Barabasi shares with us his break-through concepts that show the web is not a random connection of computers and servers, but rather an organized network that continues to develop based on growth and choice. He then goes on to illustrate how many other areas of our lives can be better understood by viewing them as networks that follow the same development principals of growth and choice.<br />I believe \\"Linked\\" will become a clasic text for those who want to apply these network concepts to the business world as well as those whose first interest is the world of science. Why do some new business formats or new products or services take off while ohers fail? A careful study of \\"Linked\\" and the concepts of hubs, growth and choice may help illustrate and explain the reasons.
B0000668IF|5.0|After the dynamite Play, Moby continues the sound of Play in some areas except that this follow-up is a bit lighter and has more Gospel samples giving the album somewhat a bit of a 60s or 70s feel to it. Play was great, 18 is just as great.<br />1)We're All Made Of Stars_Excellent lead off single. Very similar to South Side. Excellent nighttime travel music.<br />2) In This World- This song is a mix of jazz/pop with ol school hip hop beats and a Gospel vocal in the background. Kind of a bit 60s sounding.<br />3)In My Heart- Anyone remember Rushing off Play? This song has a similar piano crescendo loop only this song is not quite as eerie and more upbeat.<br />4)Great Escape- A very simple song with a cello and a female vocal. Not too bad but not that memorable<br />5)Signs Of Love- A very beautiful song. Reminiscent of Porcelain.<br />6)One OF These Mornings- This song also uses a Gospel sample voice. A very nice song.<br />7)Another Woman- One of my favorites. AW has a kind of an early 90s old school R&B sound and a strange organ playing. Sort of like linking the sounds on 1990 and 2002 together.<br />8)Fireworks- Music with atmosphere. This song is captivatingly beautiful. Makes me think of standing out on a field on a cloudy afternoon.<br />9)Extreme Ways-An upbeat R&Bish song with a weird orchestra sound in the background. Kind of 70s sounding.<br />10)Jam For The Ladies-Moby dives into the old school hip-hop realm. This song is absolutely great. Satisfies my desire for hip-hop is fun.<br />11)Sunday- Another atmospheric track with a wierd vocal sample.<br />12)18- An ambient slow track with echoing pianos. This song can be kind of depressing sometimes.<br />13)Sleep Alone- One of the highlight songs on 18. It starts off as a mellow jazzy song and then builds up into an ambient almost New Agey song.<br />14)At Least We Tried- A dreamy track that samples a drum loop from Marvin Gayes 1982 hit Sexual Healing. While nowhere near as great this song is kind of like a slowed down version but much simpler.<br />15)Harbour-WOW! Most of the other songs are enjoyable but Harbour beats the rest of 18 and is one of the best songs I,ve ever heard from Moby. It's a mellow, dreamy song with a guest vocal appearance from Sinead O'Connor.<br />16)Look Back In-This song has a weird echoing beat to it. While this song isn't bad it doesnt strike achord with me.<br />17)Rafters- Well I'll be damned. I kind of feel like being taken back to the 70s. The vocals alone give this song a 70s feel. Definately one of the oddest tracks on this CD.<br />18)I,m Not Worried At All-A nice closer to this CD. This song has a darker more atmospheric sound like the sun setting for the day.<br />On an overall scale I would say 18 is an excellent CD for the music lover. While not as groundbreaking as Play 18 is a worthy album of checking out.<br />Definately one of the best CDs of 2002!ion but much simpler. <br />15)Harbour-WOW!

0140177396|5.0|Of Men and Mice is a story about the dreams and friendship between two men during The Great Depression.  George, who is \\"small and quick,\\" faces many problems trying to keep Lennie, who is a large man with the mind of a young child, out of trouble.  George and Lennie share a dream to own land and raise animals.  To keep this dream, George does what he can to keep Lennie's strength and obsession with soft things under control.  The friendship George and Lennie had was a quality many men could not find at that time with anyone but was something that was needed in their times of loneliness. <BR> Reading this book showed how life was during The Great Depression for those who cared for someone who was mentally challenged and had the responsibility for watching over their well being.  It took patience and kindness on George's part to carry on the responsibility of care for Lennie.  George had to take Lennie everywhere he went and constantly made decisions on his behalf in the best interest for him.  In our days the challenged are taken care of, not only by family members but also by society.  One does not have to worry about the responsibility for them as much as George did for Lennie.  I can imagine how one's life was affected in those days when the responsibility was all on one.    <BR> I enjoyed reading this book because it made me realize the importance of friendship.  Many characters in the book went through loneliness and expressed their need to have a companion. My favorite part of the story was anytime Lennie would talk about the rabbits and the reactions of those he told it.  Being a big man with the brains of a child made his obsession with the rabbits as well as all soft things humorous as well as sensitive.  Though the times in which they lived in were rough and depressing, Lennie brought a bright and funny twist to it that made the reader enjoy his character. <BR> People who have friends and companions will like this book best.  It will help them appreciate having someone around to share their good and bad times.  In reading this book we feel the sorrow and jealousy of those who needed that friendship and that's something no one wants to experience.
1586210661|5.0|Painfully funny.  This was my first Sedaris exposure, and not my last.  The stories, the way he turns very sad moments in his life into wry, sarcastic learning experiences.  The way he takes very funny moments in his life and seeks out the melancholy lessons... and his reading style makes this all the better.
B00005N9CV|5.0|The Look of Love is one romantic journey!  I loved her smooth jazzy sounds on all of the tracks.  I really have to differ with the reviewer who said that her rendition of the Spanish song, Besame Mucho was not up to par.  I completely disagree as I found that song incredibly sensuous.  All ten tracks were so silky and smoooooth!!  Krall has the ability to transform any song to a lavish delight.  I not only found Besame Mucho one of my favorite tracks, but also her rendition of the Bachrach song, The Look of Love.<br />Put this CD on for a night of romance with your significant other and get lost in each other!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I love this movie. Let me just get that out of the way first. I thought the casting was brilliant, thus the acting was perfect. <br />Jake Gyllenhaal has been compared to countless, great, young actors. He shouldn't have been. He is in a class by himself. I feel the same way about Jena Malone. She will survive the transition between child star and adult actress with no problem. The rest of the cast was equally inspired. Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osbourne, Kathrine Ross and Jake's real life sister Maggie are all exceptional.<br />I think a lot of the criticism of this movie comes from people's need for a neat, tidy ending. This movie doesn't have one. It's totally up to the viewer to decide what they think happened.I have watched this movie several times and each time my conclusion is different. It depends on your mood I guess. I love that it isn't spelled out for me. I don't need to be spoon fed. I can think for myself, and this movie definitly allowed me to. I listened to the commentary and even the writer/ director doesn't really know how to explain it (that's aweome).<br />It's a commentary on a lot of things: society, values, sanity, love. Take your pick, or add your own.<br />This is a pensive film. It's not American Pie. Take some time with it. Watch it 2 or 3 times. It's worth it.<br />And just as a side note: This movie has some of the greatest dialogue in movie history (ie. the conversation about the Smurfs is priceless).
B00003CXFG|4.0|Say good-bye to space operas, Pitch Black inserts the viewer into a scenario that's all too human. The fine special effects are just a back drop for this gritty thriller -- as it should be. You'll be on the edge of your seat, and you'll never guess what happens next. A must see for any sci-fi buff.
B00006690F|5.0|I have been with Eminem from the start, well, atleast the start of his professional recording career. I love his music. I think he is brilliant...yes, I said brilliant. I'm a girl, and he doesn't offend me at all. I think he is very is insightful and sensitive. He sees the world differently and I love that. <br />This CD, in my opinion, is his best to date. He is growing as an artist. He hasn't lost his edge, but he has matured. Every song here is a keeper. <br />If everyone would stop looking for controversy, they would hear great music.
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD is great from start to end, but it's not better than the other Nirvana CDs.  People always cut down on the other CDs by Nirvana by saying that Nevermind is best one and i don't understand that. Bleach,In Utero, and Incesticide are also  great CDs,and From The Muddy Banks Of Wishka is absolutely beautiful. I'm not saying Nevermind isn't good, (Because it's wonderful)but I'd think about the other albums before you buy Nevermind just because it's the most talked about.
B00006690F|5.0|I have found \\"The Eminem Show\\" (Eminem's 3rd full length solo CD release for interscope records) to be honest, intelligent, frightening, and important.<BR>Eminem keeps it real, and I love him for it!<BR>The CD's content is much more personal this time around, a<BR>logical next step in profit Shady's evolution.
0060005424|5.0|Garth Nix has done a great job of capturing the reader's mind and imagination with the book Lirael. This book is fulled with adventure, riddles and a love for the characters. Those who have read Sabriel will be very pleased with this sequel. The book contains some original things so you can recognize things from the book Sabriel but he adds new twists that will keep you wanting to read on. The book seems long when you pick it up, but take it from me it doesn't seem half that much. :)
0201633612|4.0|This book is refered to from almost every pattern article or book I have seen and is well know for being the classic pattern book where all the others derive from. Written before the Internet boom most of the examples are related to GUI programming in C++ or SmallTalk, but it is still easy to think about how to use the patterns in the presentation/business/data layer of a modern application (there are also plenty of other books that covers that).<br />The best part of the book in my opinion is the implementation section that exists for each pattern, where the authors discuss specific implementation issues in regards to the pattern just described. Often I caught myself thinking about these issues while reading the pattern and it was very satisfying to see that this was known issues and that they were discussed.<br />The reason I do not give 5 stars is that the book can be a little bit dry reading from time to time.
157492589X|1.0|The original is great, but the original<BR>is a 4-tape set, and the version for sale<BR>here is a 1-tape set.<br />I got mine and was outraged.

B00000J7SS|5.0|Unlike \\"In A Silent Way\\", which clearly prefigures ambient music, \\"Bitches Brew\\" is firmly grounded in R&B, even if its textures are decidedly free form. This has much to do with the sinuous interplay of the musicians whom Miles Davis assembled for these sessions. Bennie Maupin's bass clarinet serves as the rhythmic counterpoint to Miles' trumpet; and, Joe Zawinul's skeletal Fender Rhodes playing is contrasted by Chick Corea's harmonically incisive runs. Even though Wayne Shorter's imput is generally limited to a few minutes of soloing per compositon, his playing is still vintage Wayne: ethereal and probing. My favorite track happens to be \\"Spanish Key\\", which best exemplifies, in my humble opinion, fusion as it was meant to be
B00003CXI0|5.0|I've only seen the theatrical release of this movie, but it was the bomb!  My favorite scene was when Hermione, Harry, and Ron battle the Mountain Troll.  The most action-packed scene was the Quidditch game, at which ended with Harry spitting out the Golden Snitch, therefore winning the game over to Gryffindor (I don't know if that's how you spell it or not).  It was funny when Harry talked to the boa constrictor, it scared Dudley.  Anyway, this was a really cool movie, and was suspenseful at times.  I definately recommend this!
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham's Skipping Christmas is nothing what I had expected.  This is not a classic Grisham storyline, but enchanting and a good quick read.
B000003S0B|4.0|I highly recommend the first four KING CRIMSON albums. They all<br />have terrific music on them and at least the first two have some<br />wonderful singing from GREG LAKE. IN THE WAKE isn't as powerful<br />as IN THE COURT, but it still has some very strong songs on it.<br /> I like the three PEACE songs, they're nice and mellow and I<br /> really like the very soothing CADENCE AND CASCADE, which fea-<br />tures some lovely flute playing from MEL COLLINS. The title track<br />is another KING CRIMSON epic, with a very powerful and melodic<br />vocal from GREG LAKE, who really excelled at singing material<br />like this. CAT FOOD is a very jazzy number and is one of K.C.'S<br />silliest songs. tis a catchy and singalongable song! The rest of<br />this may not be as strong, ( PICTURES OF A CITY is a much lesser<br />version of 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN), but this is still an<br />essential KING CRIMSON album and also an essential prog rock<br />album!
0440180295|1.0|Though this book has so many reviews, I decided to share my opinion.  It appears that a fair number of people love this book, as it was at my school when we read it.  However, I'd like to tell anyone who thought it was overly strange and disjointed, I agree!  So it goes... some enjoy classics like this, some do not.  My english teacher told me I took it too seriously.  All I have to say to him is, \\"Po-tee-weet!\\"
B00000J7I3|5.0|Motley Crue's Too Fast For Love brings back an unusual number of fond memories for me.  My best friend, Chris, got me into the Crue in high school by handing me a cassette of Too Fast For Love and saying I needed to hear it.  He couldn't have been more right.  The songs burst with punky energy and addictive choruses.  Pretty soon we were cranking it up on our aimless after-school drives around Williamsburg looking for things to do.  A full tank of gas, a mess of Jolly Rancher apple sticks, and Too Fast For Love on the cassette player...that's living.<br />What's so great about this album?  Well, for one thing the Crue have always been excellent songwriters.  These songs are simple and tight with super-catchy choruses that reel you in on the very first listen.  Credit Nikki Sixx (my favorite member of the Crue) with those achievements.  Still, it's Tommy Lee's drumming that stands out most for me on this album.  The drums are wonderfully loud and he way overuses the cow bell which is always a good thing (as anyone who appreciates the Saturday Night Live skit about Blue Oyster Cult's `Don't Fear the Reaper' knows).  Highlights include `Live Wire', `Come On And Dance', `Public Enemy #1', `Take Me To The Top', `Starry Eyes', and `Too Fast For Love'.  <br />I wouldn't dare say how Too Fast For Love stacks up against other Crue classics like Shout at the Devil and Dr. Feelgood in terms of quality, but there's no question Too Fast For Love is my sentimental favorite.  It's the album that got me into the Crue, after all.
B00004RF9G|4.0|It must be said that &quot;Brigadoon&quot; falls short of the classic Hollywood musicals.  This is no &quot;Singing in the Rain,&quot; &quot;On the Town,&quot; &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; or &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;  Several disappointing choices and compromises were made when adapting the play to the screen, and the film suffers for it.  The original idea to film on location with a Scottish cast would have lent a needed air of authenticity to this Hollywood fairy tale.  Having seen the musical performed live, I sorely miss the Sword Dance.<br />With that out of the way, I really enjoy &quot;Brigadoon.&quot;  Gene Kelly and Van Johnson are great together, with Van Johnson providing the most memorable moments.  His sharp wit is on display, and his cynicisms is refreshing amongst Gene Kelly and Cyd Charis's wide-eyed instant love.  (Gene and Cyd are great as well, they just are allowed less character development time.)<br />Not all of the songs are memorable, but some are outstanding.  I love &quot;Go Home to Bonnie Jean&quot; and &quot;Waiting for my Dearie.&quot;  &quot;The Wedding Dance&quot; segment is great cinema, with the clans gathering by torchlight for the Wedding, along with some traditional Scottish dancing.<br />It is definitely a musical that grows on you over time.  I enjoy it much more now than the first time I watched it.  I am pleased to own it.
B00006690F|5.0|\\"The Eminem Show\\" is a wonderful follow up to Eminem's Grammy winning CD, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\".  \\"The Eminem Show\\" provides impressive raps, lyrics and beats.  Eminem shows off his subperb rapping talent.  Some of the highlights are \\"White America\\", \\"Business\\", \\"Cleaning Out My Closet, \\"Without Me\\", and \\"Sing For The Moment\\".  On \\"Sing For The Moment\\", the chorus from Aerosmith's hit song, \\"Dream On\\" is used.  That is a wonderful addition to the song.  Every song is great.  This is by far Eminem's greatest work thus far.  This CD is a must have for any Eminem fan or rap fan.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  The lyrics are included in the cd booklet.  A must have for your collection!
B00005YW4H|4.0|It's true that Norah Jones does not have one of the most powerful voices in music but it is beautiful in its own right.  This CD combines elements of jazz, blues, and country music to create a sound that is both distinct and calming.  I would say it is a lazy sunday afternoon kind of album.  My favorite songs are Come Away With Me, Don't Know Why, and the tango influenced I've Got to See You Again.  Buy the cd if you like a more laid back sound.

B00005MAM2|5.0|\\"Blade Runner\\" blew everybody's mind with its stunning visuals and deeply philosophical story of the line between man and machine, creating the sub-genre known commonly as cyberpunk. \\"Akira\\" stands as not only a testament to the beauty of animation (especially Japanese anime), but also to the expansiveness of the genre \\"Blade Runner\\" created. But to call \\"Akira\\" an animated version of \\"Blade Runner\\" is not only inaccurate, but a serious injustice to the genius of \\"Akira.\\" This special edition DVD captures all the essence of \\"Akira,\\" giving any fan all he or she could ever want out of the film, and more.<BR>First of all, the movie is as brilliant as ever, if not moreso. The newly restored movie gives brighter color, sharper picture, and thus intensifying the already wild visuals. The picture is better, the sound is better, and the subtitle translation is better (I refuse to watch the new English track though...while I generally hold no malice against dubs, this new version has the English actors using Japanese pronounciations of the names...it just doesn't work in English, even though the actual dialogue is a more accurate translation). The story is as brain-numbing as a university lecture on quantum physics combined with the philosophies of Socrates and Plato, with a little Philip K. Dick thrown in. Katsuhiro Otomo's storytelling is just brilliant! 30 years after a holocaust that went the world into WWIII, Neo-Tokyo stands where Tokyo once stood. A teenage biker, Tetsuo has been abused and mistreated his whole life, and when he has been granted paranormal powers, he lashes out at the world, forcing not only the ones responsible for his psychic plight, but his only friends in the world to stop him in any way they can before he reawakens a mysterious power known as Akira, the force that caused the holocaust 30 years before. Great story full of philosophical truths and possibilities, and the ending is something Stanley Kubrick would be proud of (a la \\"2001\\"). The musicby Geinoh Yamashirogumi is amazing, and has to be one of the most diverse world music soundtracks ever produced (see separate review of soundtrack album).<BR>Secondly, the DVD is incredible, chock-full of special features, from the \\"Production Report\\" documentary, to an interview with Otomo, to image galleries full of production sketches, backgrounds, and the original comic book covers, as well as a soundclip from the soundtrack. It's everything you could want out of a DVD for a film of this magnitude.<BR>This is truly one of the greatest pieces of science-fiction literature and film-making, and I encourage both anime fans and non-anime fans to see it. To see it in any form less than the one presented in this special edition is a crime. See \\"Akira!\\"
B000002UAX|5.0|I am only 14 but as i was sifting through my parents records, and realizing that they had pretty good taste, i fell in love with the classics that i love from our local classic rock station all over again. I hadn't planned on listening to any of the records tonight but i thought i would cry when i saw Abbey Road and the White Album and had to play each! This Beatles album is a personal favorite of mine and i can hardly resist singing Rocky Racoon along with my parents which would otherwise be very uncool if it wasnt for the Beatles. The songs are priceless devotions to the time period and stir something inside of young and old that is amazing! One can't help humming the bars to Back In the U.S.S.R and enjoying the catchy tunes that inundate this album. i reccommend that if you don't already have this one you buy it quickly, you and your children can enjoy this album TOGETHER!!
B000002B7W|4.0|I've just purchased my second copy of this CD, the first being permanently borrowed by a former friend 9 years ago or so. The album however is just as I remember it. It opens with the La Fortuna chorus from Carl Orff's \\"Carmina Burana\\", a rock gesture that is effective if somewhat cliche'd. Of course there is no shortage of contrived rock gestures here - Osbourne works the crowd with the requisiste \\"We love you all\\"s and bellows of \\"Rock'n'roll\\", but somehow it's not difficult to suspend jaded disbelief and be sucked into the atmosphere of what is a truly phenomenal series of live performances.<br />And now to Randy Rhoads, the undisputed star of this show. His playing is incredibly fast, flawlessly executed, often searingly beautiful, and EXCITING. Randy totally attacks each of the songs, effortlessly filling the role of what would ordinarily be two guitarists. Each track is laden with galloping fills and frantic runs, squeals and slides, and some of his solos are heart-stopping. The best tracks for me are \\"I don't know\\", \\"Crazy Train\\", \\"Mr Crowley\\" and \\"Suicide Solution\\". This last is perhaps the ultimate highlight - Randy is all over the song, embellishing what is in truth a rather neanderthal riff with a frenzy of electrifying licks. Towards the end Osbourne halts the song and introduces his \\"new guitarist\\" who after a masterful crescendo of feedback launches into what is the most astonishing guitar solo I think I have ever heard. Randy unleashes his guitar with a series of awesome solo sections. His style is to construct jagged edifices of sound and fury, then to dissolve these impatiently with pick glissando before creating something even more awesome. The last section especially is a rapid figure that Randy attacks with unparalled ferocity and plays impossibly faster and faster before heralding the song's refrain.<br />This album is a testament to what was truly a tragic loss for guitar and for music. Randy's playing sounds a bit out of place on some of the numbers (particularly the old Sabbath classics \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Iron Man\\" - Randy's virtuosity simply overflows the dimensions of these Tony Iommi songs) but all in all if you're a fan of guitar then this album is highly recommended. Awesome!
0425163407|3.0|This is not one of Patricia Cornwell's best.  It lacks the suspense and quality of some of her other novels.  There are boring sections and too many subplots.  Though somewhat of a disappointment, I did enjoy reading it.  As mysteries go, I didn't solve the who done it, which makes it worth reading.
0792833236|4.0|Raging Bull is at times disturbing, depressing, charming, comical, and intriguing.  For all of its different aspects, Raging Bull remains a classic picture and an intense character study.<br />DeNiro turns in quite a performance as the troubled boxer, Jake LaMotta.  Jake has his vices like anyone else but he is driven to drink in an effort to combat the rage welling up inside him.  One of the toughest scenes to watch was where LeMotta takes out his rage on his wife and hits her repeatedly.  I had to turn away at this point, but I guess this was typical for a boxer who is an alcoholic.<br />The movie becomes depressing when LaMotta withdraws further from society and stops boxing all together.  He becomes a study in excess and dependency and even tries his hand at stand up comedy.<br />For all of his emotional ups and downs, Jake LaMotta is an interesting and compelling character and DeNiro does an amazing job in portraying him.  If you like a dark movie that explores every facet of the human dimension, this movie is for you.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The fact that my seven year old son sat stone still, staring at the screen for two and a half hours is testimony to this movie. Truly a very good adaptation of the novel (for my money, a little too true to the book).<br />The DVD brings Harry Potter home, and while the transfer is very good (I bought, and can only recommend, the widescreen version), I found the second disc frustrating. I still haven't reached the hidden deleted scenes, and their just isn't enough stuff for movie buffs or, for that matter, grown up fans of the books. <br />Even my son, who was so caught up in the movie in the theatre, doesn't seem to have the patience or desire to wade through all this. I'm disappointed that a movie that was so popular with adults as well as children would aim the DVD squarely at the younger set (who don't seem to care anyway).
B00003CX97|4.0|As a 23 year old, it is hard to understand all of the hype that surrounded The Bridge Over The River Kwai.  From what I understand, the scene where the bridge is blown up was one of the most dramatic special effects of its day.  In this era of computer animation and digital enhancement, this is hard to imagine.<br />Evaluated in the context of its time, this movie is no doubt a classic.  The acting, the direction and the cinematography are all first rate.  The whole production is based on the true story of the American POW's who were held in a camp and forced to build the infamous bridge.  I am guessing for all of its acclaim, it is very close to the actual events that happened.<br />Everything on the DVD is good.  My only beef is with the chapter selections, there are not enough of them.  You find yourself having to fast forward through chapters to get to a specific point.  Other than this small issue, this is a DVD worth adding to your collection.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I'm a hug fan of Luc Besson and have always enjoyed his particular ability to put an ironic spin on the \\"Hollywood\\" movie.<br />Leon is what? An action-thriller? A psychological-action-thriller? It defies easy description in part because Besson is so adept at molding the material - taking our expectations and turning them on their ear. <br />For those who don't know, Natalie Portman made her film debut here, and her scenes with Jean Reno are unsettling, to say the very least. The film was criticized for its Lolita-like approach to this relationship, but understanding Besson's \\"deconstruction\\" of the sorts of relationships we expect to find in these movies is key. <br />This is a great movie, made before Besson moved into his preoccuption with visual style (The Fifth Element, The Messenger), as good, if not better, than La Femme Nikita.
B00003CXAA|5.0|There is little argument that The Godfather is one of the best movies ever made and there should be little argument that The Godfather DVD collection is as good as any.  <br /> It is a little pricey ..., but I think it is well worth it.  This is a collection of some of the best movies ever made combined with some extras that only enhance your knowledge of The Godfather series.<br />Originally based on the books by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone crime family and their exploits.  All of the sights and sounds of this immense production come alive on DVD and are as vibrant and intense as any movie out there.<br />Everyone knows that this is a classic movie, but when bundled with the second and third installments and an entire disc of extras it goes beyond being great.  It is extraordinary.
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem show is by far Eminem's best work yet.  Some really great beats from all of the songs and some really good rhymes.  Its nice to have a rapper back that is not afraid to rap about things that will catch people's attention.  This album is different from the other two in many ways which shows that he has a range of ability and he stays away from the childish slim shady and shows a side that we have heard only on D-12.  I highly recommend it even if you didn't like the past two albums give this one a shot and you will be suprised.
B00006690F|5.0|Love him or hate him, you have to agree that Eminem is one hell of a lyricist.  Beyond his boyish looks and skin color, he is one of the most popular rappers to embrace the rap scene in a long time.  Despite all the critics, protesters, and uptight politicians who would like nothing more but for this man to never speak again, with his third album \\"The Eminem Show,\\" Eminem has crafted a magnificent album that will have you hooked from the very first track.<br />Though he is well known for his edginess and controversial image on \\"The Marshall Mathers LP,\\" this album proves to be Eminem's most personal and honest work.  The songs also are a lot more catchier and well-constructed in my opinion.  And he doesn't wait to let out his aggressions on his critics and protesters.  He digs right in with a song called, \\"white america,\\" where in the chorus he repeats, \\"I could be one of your kids / little Eric looks just like this.\\"  He goes more deeper into his problems with his estranged mother in the song, \\"cleanin out my closet.\\"  And although this album is his most personal and serious, don't think that his enemies aren't going to get attacked by this lyricist.  From Cannabis in \\"square dance,\\" to Limp Bizkit and Moby in \\"without me,\\" Eminem dishes out a full-blown attack on anyone who opens their mouth about him.  And those are only some of the songs on the album I have mentioned.<br />His most personal song would have to be \\"Hailey's song,\\" which is a tribute to his daughter.  He even goes as far as to sing through most of it.  Who would've thought, Slim Shady himself can actually sing.  He doesn't do a bad job, at that.  Still, I think he shouldn't quit with the rapping.<br />Don't worry.  Although this album isn't as edgy or frightening as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP,\\" there are still plenty of humorous verses and choruses, filled with disses and venom.  And there are still going to be moments where you will be listening with your jaw on the floor thinking to yourself, \\"He didn't just say what I think he said!\\"  Eminem still is able to catch us off guard and make us cringe at times, but he's just saying what's on his mind.  I think his most outrageous song on the album is, \\"my dad's gone crazy,\\" which features his daughter.  If his mother thought he did a number on her on \\"The Marshall Mathers LP,\\" it's nothing compared to what he says in this song!<br />I really enjoyed this album, and right now I'm hooked on it.  I can't stop listening to it.  I loved every song, with the exception of \\"drips.\\"  I don't hate the song, it's just not one of my favorites.  My favorite songs are, \\"white america,\\" \\"without me,\\" \\"sing for the moment,\\" \\"my dad's gone crazy,\\" and \\"square dance.\\"  I really believe that if you're a true Eminem fan, you will love this CD.  It's still has edge to it and it is in no way watered down.  Eminem has a talent and I hope he keeps rapping for a long time.idn't just say what I think he said!\\"  Eminem still is able to catch us off guard and make us cringe at times, but he's just saying what's on his mind.

B00000IQMT|5.0|John Williams' score for the first part in George Lucas' Star Wars saga is an impressive, exciting soundtrack that echoes the sense of fun action and child-like wonder. Starting off with one of the (If not THE) most memorable theme tunes ever used for film, \\"Star Wars Main Title and the Arrival at Naboo\\" the strong percussion and light notes evoke the charcter tunes and emotions. The most original and well-orchestrated track however is of course \\"Duel of the Fates\\", a brilliant series of wild, incredible tunes accompnied by choir singing and low percussions.<br />The light-hearted tracks include \\"Anakin's Theme\\" and \\"Jar Jar's Introduction and the Swim to Otoh Gunga\\", where the tone is much less dramatic, yet still original and inventive. Over the course of the CD's running time, every note encapsulates the listener with action and humour, taking them to a galaxy far, far away. This is John Williams at his best.
B00006690F|5.0|\\"The Eminem Show\\" is no doubt Eminem's best work to date. It's hands-down great. I liked all of the track and even the skits were good this time around. There were only two tracks that I thought were not as good as the rest of alubm but two out of twenty ain't that bad. Hear is a run down of what I thought of all the songs:<BR>#1)\\"Curtains Up (skit)\\" - A good intro to the album, nothing is said but the sound effects are cool. It's defintly not a \\"Public Service Annoucment\\" though. 10/10<BR>#2)\\"White America\\" - Great song, great lyircs. 10/10 <BR>#3)\\"Business\\" - A funny cut, the lyics are good and the beat is phat. 10/10<BR>#4)\\"Cleain Out My Closet\\" - This is one of Em's top ten songs of all time. Probly the best song of the album. 10/10<BR>#5)\\"Sqaure Dance\\" - This is not a great track, but's a good one none the less. I really don't have a clue as to why I did not like this song as much as the rest of the them. 8/10<BR>#6)\\"The Kiss (skit)\\" - A good skit. Probly one of the best he's done. 10/10<BR>#7)\\"Solider\\" - A love this song. It's my new anthem. 10/10<BR>#8)\\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" - Another outstanding cut. 10/10<BR>#9)\\"Drips\\" (featuring Obie Trice) - This song is good, Obie Trice does a pretty nice job on it, he's better than any of the people from the D-12 crew. I've noticed unless it's with Dr.Dre Em's songs are best done by him self. Still a bomb track though. 9.5/10<BR>#10)\\"Without Me\\" - We all know this song! The first singel that is great! 10/10<BR>#11)\\"Paul Rosenberg (skit)\\" - This \\"Paul skit\\" deifntly improves on the last one. 10/10<BR>#12)\\"Sing For The Moment\\" - One of the best rap covers of a rock song ever. The guaitr of the song is amazing. 10/10<BR>#13)\\"Superman\\" - I liked this cut to. 10/10<BR>#14)\\"Hailie's Song\\" - It proves that Em can do more than rap & freestyle. He can actually sing. This is one of the realist song's he done! 10/10<BR>#15)\\"Steve Berman (skit)\\" - Better than the last albums \\"Steve Berman skit\\". 10/10<BR>#16)\\"When The Music Stops\\" (featuring D-12) - A great song. Tight beat. D12 only apperance on the whole record is good. 10/10<BR>#17)\\"Say What You Say\\" (featuring Dr.Dre) - The next singel! I know that this song would be a hit. 10/10<BR>#18)\\"'Til I Collapse\\" (featuring Nate Dogg) - Good duo! Em's tight raps & Nate's smooth voice make for a great song. 10/10<BR>#19)\\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" (featuring Hailie Jade) - Least favorite song on the album. I think it just take a diffrent rout then the rest of the stuff. I mean it's still a good cut but Hailie Jade's vocie is anoying. 8/10<BR>#20)\\"Curtian Close (skit)\\" - Same as the first skit. But on this Ken Kaniff makes he hiarlous return! 10/10<BR>So I will give the album a 10/10. With rounding it comes out to a 10/10. The DVD is also good. I would give that a 10/10. One thing wrong with it, is like the quitly of it's not the best. The peformances are good (10/10), the music video is good (9.5/10), The traile for \\"8 Mile\\" was great (10/10),\\"The Slim Shady Show\\" episode is the best \\"Slim Shady Show\\" episode out (10/10). And the behind the scenes Em talking about the album is good (9/10). So this a great package cd. The front and back covers are cool (10/10), the book is great (10/10). I'm so glad they put the lyircs on there. The two disc are neart. I like the picture thing on when you take the cd's out (10/10). It's just wonderful (about) two hours spent. The cd last almost 78 mintues and the DVD last almost 46 mintues. I really can see how he has changed, this cd is not like \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" he has clamed down but he is still great. Go out and get this cd you won't be upset with it. This is one of the all time best hip-hop/rap cd's ever!<BR>10/10
B00005QDW5|2.0|How can you take amazing musical moments like \\"The Great Gig in the Sky,\\" which follows \\"Time\\" on \\"Dark Side\\" and just slap it on a CD.  Pink Floyd, more than most groups, have songs that MUST be listened to in the context of their original albums.  Why anyone would shell out the cash for this jumble instead of buying \\"The Wall\\" and their other masterpieces is beyond me?!  Since it was a success, you know that P.T. Barnum was right!!!!
6304297912|5.0|While there is definitely a form of macabre humor to this tail, \\"Trainspotting,\\" one of the most brilliant films to come out of Britain in decades, is no laughing matter.<br />It captures an entire voice--a feeling--a depth of despair among a group of disaffected, addicted, hopeless young men in the slums of Edinburgh. Having been in Scotland many times, and known young men of this age, I found this grim portrait all the more frightening and heartbreaking. They are essentially beautiful young men (some of them, anyway) who are casually and uncaringly dying while injecting themselves unflinchingly with heroine.<br />No part of the heroine experience is hidden from the viewer, and I advise those who don't want to share the experience to avoid this movie. For the hovels, toilets, dingy bars, and alleys where these mates shoot up, and the close-up of the bloody needles, the mixing of the drug, and every other horror, is unrelenting. Add in the fear of AIDS, some hopelessly mindless and unfulfilling sex, a dead baby, real and hallucinated, and you have some idea of the nature of this film.<br />So what makes it so brilliant? Everything. From the acting of Ewan MacGregor et al. to the spare script, to the photography, to every last detail, this is the quintessential picture of despair in the true noir sense. It is very hard to watch, very hard to think about--but is an experience not to be missed, and it is one that does not leave you anytime soon.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Like Marvin's treatise on the state of the union, Midnight Oil's masterpiece from 1988 gave many Americans exposure to Australia's issues.  Like Marvin, Midnight Oil were also able to sing political songs without them sounding like textbooks (listen to &quot;The Dead Heart,&quot; one of the catchiest songs ever).  In fact, this album was SOOO strong, when I saw them in concert for the &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot; album (another classic), they played every single song from &quot;Diesel and Dust!&quot;  Still a great album to listen to in the summertime, on a road trip, where the heat can make pontificate over these amazing lyrics.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Last winter's release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was a complete triumph, setting a standard that may be impossible for future films of the series to meet.<BR>It's not just the great casting (especially the kids, who are fantastic) and the digital magic we have come to expect from movie effects. The real triumph is how fully the creative team captured J.K. Rowling's imaginary world and all the important events.<BR>It's all there. Everything you loved about the book is at least alluded to in the film, it's in there somewhere. The screenwriters did not substitute their own cleverness for Rowlings' nor did they slavishly copy every detail. They used what they had to to make the story clear and sprinkled the rest in as well as they could. And they did a brilliant job of it. (It does cause some worry. Subsequent books of the series have grown longer and longer. How can they possibly fit them into a movie that doesn't last 6 hours, without leaving out an awful lot?)<BR>It's important to remember when viewing something like this (&quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is an even better example) that the book is not the story. The book tells the story in the way a book does. Movies tell stories in a different way, they're a different experience, which accounts for frequent complaints or disappointments. <BR>But &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; works as a movie without sacrificing anything of the book. And that is a terrific achievement.<BR>The DVD has plenty of special features, but they're displayed in a way that's a little too cute for me. My kids love all that schtick, but I'd just as soon scroll down a menu and click what I want instead of playing a game to get what I'm after. <BR>But that's a fairly trivial complaint, I'll admit. The packaging is pretty slick, the features (once you find them) are plentiful and interesting, and the movie is excellent.<BR>(One side note - While the special effects capture Quidditch pretty well, it only illustrates how stupid the game is. Why have all those other players when the only ones that really matter are the seekers? Why not have your other players forget the quaffle and chase the snitch? As a fairly intense sports fan, I find the broomstick game absurd, impossible to believe. I've gotta think if there really were a wizard game on brooms, it wouldn't be Quidditch, which makes no sense.)
B000005DQR|5.0|This CD has grown to become one of my all time favorite albums. One note: THIS IS NOT TECHNO!!! THIS IS NOT IDM!!  I would have to agree with one of the earlier reviews of this album and say that it more closely resembles \\"Jazz\\" then anything else. (Perhaps some kind of \\"nu-Jazz\\"?) And the uses are numerous!<BR>...P>This CD is just PHENOMINAL! It's almost like a movie you watch with your ears. Or maybe, just MAYBE, DJ Shadow has created the soundtrack to life.
B000009QO6|4.0|Satanism is always a difficult concept to sell in an album without having the demonic references ultimately undermine the seriousness of the music; however, Danzig successfully walks the fine line between convincing doom and self-parody on his debut.  A sense of despair surrounds this album, and in the end it is one of the few albums in devil rock that achieves its goal of creating a convincing and sustained mood of wickedness.  Standout tracks are \\"Mother,\\" \\"Am I Demon,\\" Twist Of Cain,\\" \\"Not Of This World,\\" and \\"Soul On Fire.\\"  This is an excellent album by the former Misfits front man, and it is one of the best heavy metal albums of the 80s.
B00005OAIE|3.0|As a blues and Jazz artist myself - he definetly has a rich songwrting and singing talent. Shades of the classics come through in his LIVE shows. (of which you can listen to streaming samples on the web) However this 'manufatured' CD is missing some of the richness of his live performance. Thankfully, John Mayer is rooted in the old 'sharing-is-caring' school of music.<br />It has the essence of what he can really deliver, but what it is missing is the real honest delivery that he can wallop you with when he's up on stage. - oh well. Not necessarily a must have CD, but it is definetly something that you should consider adding to your listening rep. It's worth the time
B00003CXI1|2.0|The Harry Potter series is a wonderfull epic for kids and adults alike. Those who consider these books \\"controversial\\" because of the use of witchcraft in a light and entertaining manor need to take a hard look at the other influencing factors seeping into childrens lives. Overtly sexual and violent radio and TV don't seem to irk these folks, nor does rampant commerciallism turning kids into Nike wearing automatons. But a little magic makes them foam at the mouth. I'd say the priorities of the content critics are askew.<BR>But this isn't my main point. The movie is something of a dud. I don't recommend it. Unless you're a hard core Harry fan, it'll make little sense and be a tad boring. I was terribly dissappointed at the film given the amount of talent behind it. I came away only appreciating the production design and the score.<BR>The DVD is a poorly produced product as well. The transfer looks overbright and contrasty with the colors washed out. And the second disc which contains all the supplementary material is a collection of confusing and rediculous puzzles that must be solved before you can access anything of interest. I gave up looking for the deleted scenes because they simply aren't labeled anywhere and I've got no time to go hunting for them. That which I could find were just rehashed scenes from the movie and some crooked unlabeled drawings.<BR>Perhaps a child with time on there hands and interest may find this more engaging but it annoyed me and I wondered why the option of skipping the games wasn't included. It really just seems thrown together. And poor Jim Dale is given the worst lines to read as the DVD MC.<BR>This could have been the saving grace for this production had they created really informative and interesting disc set. It seems they're just looking to wow you with DVD tricks that aren't magical at all.<BR>I'm just patiently awaiting book 5 and leaving this to the kiddies (who deserve better!).
0767805712|5.0|\\"Gattaca\\" is an incredible example of a science-fiction movie entirely based on plot, low-key twists and development, and not on special effects. Married couple Hawke and Thurman, along with Jude Law, and the direction of Andrew Nicol prove that there is no gene for the human spirit.<br />Vincent (Hawke) is an invalid, a \\"degenerate\\" born of natural conception without any advanced genetic engineering. Several seconds after he is born, his parents know how Vincent will die, and his life expectancy. As he grows, his heart dysfunction limits his career choices. As a result, his parents have another child, this time genetically engineered to be totally superior. The feuding siblings prove themselves over a game of swimming chicken, but it is inevitable as Anton grows more faster than Vincent that the younger child will be the favored. As a result, Vincent leaves the home and begins a job as a janitor at the Gattaca Aerospace Center, the closest he can be to his dream: the stars. But he finds that a janitor is the farthest away. Vincent trains his body and mind, but still cannot get past the cleaning job. Then, he makes a call.<br />He wants to be a defective ladder, or, a stand-in for a enhanced person. Vincent stands in for one of the most prized people, Jerome Morrow (Law). His disguises are perfect. Jerome supplies the blood, urine, and hair to Vincent. Then, just as Vincent is getting along at Gattaca, there is a murder of the exact mission director that was in charge of the flight to Titan that included Vincent. Enter enhance Irene (Thurman) and investigators Hugo and Josef. Vincent adequately, with the help of Jerome, sneaks past the investigators at every turn while a relationship develops between himself and Irene. Drama, suspense, incredible acting follow.<br />Hawke, in one of his first dramatic leads, shines as he plays an ordinary man who is extrodinary in using everyday techniques. He is the most human character in the entire movie, but holds the weight forall the the genetically enhanced. Uma Thurman, who's not given such a role as Hawke, does well with what she have. Director Niccol really accentuates on her beauty and innocence as he plays Irene, and enhance that really has no idea of the real life that Vincent is so accustomed to. There is excellent chemistry between the two. The two dated after the movie was over, and eventually were wed. There is a great supporting cast, including Alan Aarkin, Jude Law, and Ernest Borgnine.<br />\\"Gattaca\\" is an under-rated movie that suprises all, and wonders how much spirit we can all have.
B000065U1N|5.0|I have to admit.  When I heard they were making the book (by Mark Bowden) into a movie I was scared.  I'm well aware of Hollywood messing up films by making them unrealistic (Pearl Harbor, Vertical Limit, etc...).  However, I was very (VERY) surprised with the accuracy of this movie!  I haven't seen a movie follow a book this well since A Bridge too Far, and I haven't seen a realistic movie like this since Saving Pvt. Ryan.  It is definetly going to be going down as being one of the greatest war films of all times, and one of my all time favorites as well.
6305538018|5.0|At first, alot of people really gave this movie a bad review. It came out the same time The Matrix did, but eXistenZ was not mainstream. I picked this movie up from the video store and I loved it. This movie will be well liked by gamers and such. It has a nice polt twist throughout the whole movie. Kinda wierd, but fun.
B000059ZT4|4.0|The great debate as to which Bob is better (pre-Chris Blackwell or post-Chris Blackwell) will probably rage on forever and I won't get into it here. But this double disc set could be submitted as exhibit &quot;A&quot; to help Marley fans make up their own minds. As for myself, I HAD to have disc one: the Jamaican produced album BEFORE Blackwell got his well-intentioned hands on the recordings. Personally, I didn't appreciate the fact that I had to buy it with disc two: the officially released &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; album sweetened/slicked up a touch by Blackwell and a few non-Wailers session musicians, which I had TWO copies of already (the original CD release and then the re-mastered CD release.)    Having said that, I have no regrets with my Deluxe Edition purchase although it is a tad pricey. The well produced packaging is a veritable recreation of the original album cover &quot;lighter&quot; design which is a classy touch and there are some decent photographs inside. You'd think with all the work they put into this the liner notes would be a bit more detailed but over all, thumbs up.
B00005ARDC|5.0|These guys get a lot of flack for playing rock and roll the way it was meant to be played. A lot of people call them unoriginal or derivative. I think that's totally wrong- they have a sound all their own and they are the best band in rock right now.<BR>This album is so needed right now.
B00006690F|5.0|Yes, that annoying blonde motormouth has returned. If it seems that he's still rapping about the same stuff (hating his mom and Kim, loving his daughter, dissing his fans and his detractors), you're pretty close. However, he has dropped a few nuggets of political wisdom within the album (\\"White America\\", \\"Squaredance\\") and his flows (especially about current pop culture) still astound. On top of that, he's produced most of the album, which is a good thing because he's learned some tricks and keeps the sounds interesting if the rap drags, throwing in a club beat (\\"Without Me\\"), Southern bounce (\\"Squaredance\\"), upper-class rap-rock (\\"White America\\") and funk (\\"Till I Collapse\\"). In spite of a simply horrible, misogynistic duet with Obie Trice that is completely unnecessary (\\"Drips\\"), this album captures the three-faced persona of Marshall Mathers (the loving, yet narcisstic human), Eminem (Marshall's rap persona who is arrested and has a hot temper) and Slim Shady (Eminem's further ego who is plain twisted) in the most complete way yet. If some of the fat of this album was cut and the personas a little more concentrated and focused, this album would have been a sheer masterpiece. However, it's light years ahead of most third albums in an artist's career, let alone in rap. He's still the most compelling artist since Kurt Cobain and most vital of today. Let the \\"Show\\" begin.
B00000DFTG|5.0|The first Sabbath concert I attended was in Manchester, England in 1971. That show was opened by a long forgotten band who filled the stage with amps and speakers and played so loud I could hardly hear when they finished. Then a curtain at the rear of the stage opened and Sabbath's PA system dwarfed that bands equipment. However the big difference was not that Sabbath were louder (they were) but that they played fantastic doom laden music which swept you along right throught to the climax  Children Of The Grave, By the time this was being played everybody was standing, arms aloft two fingers raised in answer to ozzy, it could be yesterday! This album almost catches that feeling again. That for me is what this album is about, the feel, the atmosphere, the sheer noise of a Sabbath gig! Brilliant.
B000060MY6|5.0|WAIT A MINUTE. This is paper chEese.
B000065U1N|5.0|EMOTIONAL is the only word that comes to mind. We seldom learn from films but learn from this one I did. The film was so engrossing that when it was over I let out a sigh of relief. Relief in that I was exhausted watching these guys getting pummeled without let up. Our politicians in Washington must be forced to see this film and read the book. Perhaps then will they better understand what out men & women in uniform are faced with.<br />I was happy to see that this film was not only true to the book but also to history. I feel anger and extreme sadness that our guys were killed and mutilated. But they fought with honor and dignity. If only the Commander in Chief at that time could have done the same.
B000002GK1|5.0|Warning: If you have only listened to &quot;Superunknown&quot; or &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;, you will not like &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; (there is nothing wrong with either of those albums, they were just more mainstream aimed).  With that set aside, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; found Soundgarden at their heavy metal peak before the grunge movement took complete shape.  The smash hit &quot;Outshined&quot;, along with &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; were the highlights of this album, but &quot;Searching With My Good Eye Closed&quot;, &quot;New Damage&quot; and &quot;Holy Water&quot; are personal favorites of mine.  But what attracted me to Soundgarden was the same thing that attracted me to Alice in Chains; the mysticism, the fact that you didn't know all the time what the songs were about, not to mention the fantastic musicianship and Cornell's howling vocals (just listen to &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, Henry Rollins was right when he said Cornell could peel the paint off walls with his voice).  All in all, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; is a landmark album in the career of the once mighty Soundgarden.
B00003003R|4.0|I have to start by saying I'm not really a huge fan of live albums. Some are great, and some are, well, really awful. This album blew me away. Being a HUGE Guns N' Roses fan, I had to get it, and I was not disappointed at all. The quality is great and the more I listen to it, the more I wish I had lived back in that era. I could feel the energy of Slash's guitar, the power of Axl's vocals, that arena of fans chanting back the chorus to GN'R's cover of \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\\" (the best rendition I've heard). It's just such a good album; it makes you feel something, and even if you don't like Guns N' Roses, this will change your mind. It's more than a CD, it's an experience.
6303020089|5.0|If any TV series deserved the big screen treatment, it would have to be THE FUGITIVE.  This superb series, which starred the late David Janssen and ran on ABC-TV from 1963 to 1967, was a huge hit on the small screen.  And in 1993, it got to the big screen with excellent results.<br />Taking over from Janssen, Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, who is arrested, tried, and convicted for the murder of his wife Helen (Sela Ward)--a murder that he did not commit.  On the way to an Illinois prison, the bus he and other prisoners are riding in suffers a catastrophic accident and a collision with a train.  Ford manages to escape, but now the feds, under the leadership of U.S. marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), are after him, and they are relentless.  Ford is forced to do whatever it takes to stay just out of the law's reach and not only find the one-armed assailant who actually killed his wife, but also why the murder even happened in the first place.<br />Without an unneccesary amount of graphic violence or out-of-control explosions, director Andrew Davis (UNDER SIEGE) manages to build suspense in the classic Hitchcock tradition.  Indeed, both the film and the TV series upon which it is based are superlative variations on a favorite Hitchcock theme--a man on the run for a crime he didn't commit.  If the plot seems a bit incredulous at times, this is only a minor flaw; and it is easily forgotten just watching Ford piece together a sinister puzzle to prove his innocence to everyone, especially the tenacious, hard-as-nails Jones.<br />Jones won a richly-deserved Oscar for his slightly sardonic performance as Sam Gerard, especially for his line about searching every \\"warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, and doghouse\\" after the train wreck.  But it is Ford who really carries this movie.  We sympathize with his plight and we are with him just about every step of the way.  Like Hitchcock's characters, as well as those in Spielberg's movies, we are put into the shoes of Ford's character and forced to think about what we might do if we were ever under the same kind of pressure.<br />THE FUGITIVE is vigorously recommended to anyone who appreciates good, old-fashioned suspense and thrills with believable characters and a believable plot.  Pick it up!
B000002H38|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums.  Everytime time I got depressed, I would put it on.  I've lost about 3 copies of it and<BR>am currently buying a 4th one. Folks don't like to return this CD.  It's timeless, soulful, jazzy and truly uplifting music.  There is not a bad song on this album.  Even though it came out a long time ago, get this album if you don't have it.  I'm definitely getting this and Best Of when it comes out.  Now that I have a CD burner, I'm making 3 copies of the next CD that I buy and am storing them in 3 different locations.
B000062XE1|5.0|Bless the BBC for making those gems from their PLAY OF THE MONTH series finally available to the public. I hope this is only the beginning, since one can only imagine what treasures lie in that noble institution's archives!<br />This collection includes four of Wilde's plays: AN IDEAL HUSBAND (1969), THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1976), LADY WINDEMERE'S FAN (1985) and THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST (1988). These insightful adaptations of Oscar Wilde's masterpieces featuring wonderful performances by top British thespians (John Gielgud, Joan Plowright, Jeremy Brett, Susan Hampshire, Margaret Leighton, Peter Firth, Judy Bowker and Dinah Sheridan to name but a few) are a delight to watch, and call for repeat viewing.<br />A great deal of effort clearly went into this box set, so you're not just getting a pixillated transfer from video to DVD. The plays have been digitally remastered so the DVD version is visually stunning and the sound is crystal-clear, allowing us to savour every line of Wilde's witty dialogue. Each play comes with chapterisation and notes on cast members. An interesting 60-minutes documentary of Oscar Wilde's life and loves has been added as a bonus. Fans of Jeremy Brett should know he has major parts in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY and AN IDEAL HUSBAND. Those who fell in love with his rendition of Sherlock Holmes will not want to miss this opportunity to see him brilliantly handle the intricacies of Wilde's works. His superb performances alone are reason enough to buy the set. 408 Minutes of joy.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is my favorite album of all time.  I have seen some bad reviews by people who tend to be very closed minded metalheads or rock traditionalists.  They say &quot;there is no musicianship to this album, and Kurt C. was not a guitar player, and you can't understand the lyrics, and this is very overrated, Teen Spirit is the only good song, etc...&quot;  You probably won't like this album if you enjoy one-dimensional, homophoobe, guitar solo infested, self-centered, bland, heavy metal, faux rebellion macho rock.  That is just a disclaimer.  <br />What these people are missing is that Kurt Cobain was not at all concerned with the technical aspects of his music, he simply wanted to express his anger and pain.  I know this sounds cliche, but it is the truth.  And to those who say this is nothing but depressing, I'm sorry but everyone's life can't be filled with flowers and happy things (and the album is more of an uplifting rebellion than a downtrod depressing resignation anyway).  <br />I will not take the time to review each song, because that has been done enough already.  What I will say is this:  I can 100% honestly say that even if the album was never boosted by critics or mtv, and barely anyone knew about it, it would still be my favorite of all time.  Because of my opinion, not others.<br />So, buy it if you don't have it.
B00005O438|3.0|Up font, I'm a fan of Stephen King.  The problem with the film Cujo is lack of suspense.  The story is simple; anyone of us could have written this plot.  If you live in the county there often are stories of rabid animals.  This one just took a slim occurrence and exaggerated it.  Although the story is basic and the acting at best is fair, the directing and editing are good; in fact they save this \\"B\\" film.  Maybe I've gotten numb to suspense and thrillers.  Maybe this was scary at the time it was produced in 1983; either way, unless you are collecting Stephen King works, this film is an occasional rental.  This film is rated R for graphic violence and due to gore from a pet dog, I wouldn't recommend it for children or pet lovers!
0140435131|4.0|Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" es a truly remarkable novel.  Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard.  Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser.  He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years.  After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.<br />  The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold.  The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining  experience.  An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes.  Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him.  These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard.
0393312836|4.0|By writing A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess created one of the most disturbing novels that I have ever read.  It begins with our most humble narrator, Alex, living his teenage years as a drug-addicted bugular and rapist.  Alex and his friends commit crimes for fun and see nothing wrong with their incredibly violent ways.  When eventually Alex is caught by the police and put in the State Jail, he is entered into a program that will supposedly 'cure' him of his violent actions and allow him to go free.  The question is, though, does someone actually become 'good' when their free will to make that choice is taken away?  Which is worse: choosing to do wrong or being forced to choose good?  Burgess really makes you think about that idea as Alex's life progresses after he goes through the cruel procedure to 'reform' him.  I would definitely recommend reading this book to anyone, as long as they are prepared for a lot of violence and gore (as well as Burgess' invented slang that Alex and his friends use - it takes a little while to get used to).  What's it going to be then, eh?  Go read A Clockwork Orange and get ready to think about a lot of stuff you never have before.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I purchased this enhanced CD and it is a masterpiece.  Nothing else comes close to the great beats on this collection.

I truly enjoy this album, and would highly recomment it to anyone with a love, or an inkling to love jazz.

B000002H72|5.0|I truly enjoy this album, while it may not have a lot influence from Kim Deal, it still in my opinion the best Pixies' album.  If you would like to get a delicious taste of this album, listen to Debaser, Wave of Mutilation, not to mention, the poppier tune Here Comes Your Man.  I think even the novice ear would enjoy this album, I highly recommend it.

B000067D8W|4.0|WB's new top-rated show, Smallville, has finally hit DVD! For those who are a bit fuzzy on the details, the show revolves around the teenage years of Clark Kent, whose destiny eventually leads him to become Superman. I'm not completely sure of the specs of the disc, but appearantly it includes the Pilot episode and the second episode (Metamorphisis), a deleted scene from the Pilot episode, an audio commentary by the producers, and an interactive map of Smallville.<br />Admittedly, these two early episodes don't represent the best of what Smallville has to offer. Critics who think of the show as a Buffy/Dawson's Creek clone will have plenty to pick on here: we get a homecoming dance, teen angst over the girl next door (Lana Lang, played by an amazingly beautiful Kristen Kreuk)a 'freak of the week' who can control electricity (and later another one in the 'bugboy' vein), actors way too old to be in high school, and a typical 'Buffy-esque' plot: Boy likes girl. Girl has jealous jock boyfriend. Jealous jock boyfriend strings up boy in cornfield with kryptonite draped around his neck. And yes, the ending is overly sentimental and melodramatic, but like all hollywood teen flicks, it'll still manage to break your heart.<br />However, the show still offers plenty of good stuff, for both newcomers and devoted Superman fans. The interaction between the characters are dead on, as is casting. The guy from the Dukes of Hazzard and Lana Lang from 'Superman III' (sorry, I can't spell their names) are perfect as Clark's parents. Tom Welling, Clark Kent, besides being a great actor, resembles previous Supermen Dean Cain and Christopher Reeve, and carries on the torch well. You'll forget about how old Welling really is five minutes into the story. Perhaps the show's riskest gamble, introducing a young Lex Luthor as Clark's big-brother/mentor, is it's biggest payoff. Michael Rosenbaum steals the show as Lex Luthor, and the show does a great job playing on the irony of his friendship with Clark.<br />There are also several Superman references for fans, as is the norm with each episode. Be on the lookout for Clark in a symbolic red Superman cape, and the familiar 'S' shield in the most unlikely of situations.<br />I highly recommend this disc. While the episodes are somewhat weak, the quality of the show has increased with almost every episode, and there's still enough goodies in here to warrant a look. Heres to hoping Smallville will be a very successful series.with Clark.<br />There are also several Superman references for fans, as is the norm with each episode.

B000063S6Z|5.0|This is as good CD. People say it is very like \\"Play\\", and it really is. Though sometimes the harmony is all the same - C - Am - C - Am, etc. But it really catches your soul. \\"The saddest song to play\\". Buy it.
0553278223|5.0|I'm not much of a science fiction buff but this book was a &quot;mandatory&quot; read when I was in high school.  As I began to read each chapter, I fell more and more in love with this book.  So much to the point that I kept the book for myself - over 10 years ago!  And to this day, I cannot pinpoint exactly why I like this book.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Are you sure I can't rate a film 6 stars???  This would be one deserving of it!  I am 49 and my husband is 54 and we went to theater twice to see this one and I cant wait for my DVD to arrive.  The books are great - the movie even better!  The child actors are suberb in their roles and then there are the special effects.....<br />And as for children being unable to distinguish between a fantasy movie and Wicca - all I can say isn't it time to stop underestimating our youth?  <br />And while the movie is great fantasy on magic - it bears no relationship to Wicca.  If you are not Pagan and don't understand what it means to embrace Wicca as a religion - please don't attempt to equate Wicca and fantasy of Witches and Wizards...  You only betray your ignorance.<br />Bright Blessings!

6304140711|3.0|This movie leaves you wondering how  a sweet and lovely girl like Nicole (played by Reese Witherspoon) could have fallen for a really low life nasty guy like David (Marc Wahlenburg)  , but who can judge how a teenage girl thinks? It becomes a gripping thriller as David the psychopath unleashes a reign of terror on Nicole and her family.<br />Two other interesting characters are Nicole's father whose authoritative strength and lack of hesitation to act against David ultimately saves the day- a pity more fathers aren't prepared to do what is necessary ; and Margeux (played by Alyssa Mylanno) Nicole's  brassy but good-hearted best friend who's life I always feared for at the hands of evil David (who brutally terrorises her) but who I was very happy to see get through<br />A male schoolfriend of Nicoles is not however so lucky as he is followed home by David and savagely beaten to death.<br />The end of the movie see's aparticularly gripping scene which after much horror leads to the deserving defeat and death of David and his villainous goons.
B000062TU1|3.0|Good Lord.  Now, I liked the Harry Potter movie, so this is mainly a rant on the inaccessibility of the DVD version: Disc 2 is loaded with a bunch of useless stuff, and it's nigh-on impossible to get to the deleted scenes (which I was dying to see).  If you get this turkey and want the nice extras, be prepared to jump through hoops just to find them.
B00006690F|5.0|No doubt, this is the best LP released from him yet.  Jay-z, Nas and any other so called \\"REAL\\" rappers got nothing on him.  You can feel him with the lyrics he spits, and tell he put alot of emotion in this one.  He tells the public that he does'nt get the respect he should and I agree with him, he IS the BEST, most VERSATILE rapper we have ever seen, who else can pull the stuff off that he has??  BIGGIE and PAC, they were great but NO, can they pull off something like Hailie's song??  I don't think so.  Matter of fact I know they can't!! And I know you agree with me, have they ever did something like that?? Nope.  If you had to buy only ONE cd this year, THIS IS THE ONE, even if you like him or not, after you listen to this album you will respect him not only as a rapper but as a individual.
B00006690F|5.0|Believe me when i say this is Eminem's best album yet, combine his talent with his sense of humor and you have one the best albums in recent memory. He does mostly the same old [stuff] but he also sings and even covers an aerosmith song!! but the best moments come when he's just cutting loose and letting out whatevers on his mind, though sometimes it gets a little stale still its one the best albums in recent memory bar none.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I know what you're thinking, \\"Oh God! Another Bee Gees album??! How much more do I have to take?\\" That's the typical mindset of many people who only know the Bee Gees as the hairy-chested, medallion and tight pants wearing, big toothed, falsetto singing \\"disco kings\\".  Heck, I wasn't even alive when the Bee Gees were at their peak and I recognize the stigma. This image, however, is an extremely unfair one. What most people don't or refuse to realize is that the Brothers Gibb have had a successful career almost 20 years before and after Saturday Night Fever! Even though it's INCREDIBLY unfair that the opinions of all Bee Gees music are based on just a terribly small fraction of their tremendous body of work (the music from Saturday Night Fever), it is still good music and should not be forgotten or ridiculed. This is not a review about their work from the 70's, however, it is one about the Gibb's latest masterpiece, \\"This Is Where I Came In\\".<br />The sounds of high voices and disco beats have been abandoned. In a very smart move, the Bee Gees have returned to their 60's roots.<br />This is Where I Came in: This track is BRILLIANT! The best song on the album, and possibly one of the greatest the Bee Gees have ever written. (And that's saying a lot considering the huge catalogue of music that the Bee Gees have produced over their 40-year career.) The song has an unexplainable ability to captivate. It begins with a bluesy, acoustic guitar riff played by Maurice Gibb, which opens up to the haunting vibrato of Robin. Barry Gibb takes his turn in a verse with a very sexy, breathy vocal that leads into the bass-electrified chorus. The impeccable brotherly harmonies kick in, reminding you of what good music is supposed to sound like. The only recognition of Bee Gees from the 70's is the pulsing beat that penetrates the song after the chorus. This track is worth the price of the album alone.<br />Wedding Day: This song is one of the strongest on the album, proving that the Bee Gees major strength is in writing ballads. The mood presented from the song is very sentimental and heartwarming. Robin's voice on the chorus is wonderful and Barry's vocal during the bridge is very emotional. Great track.<br />Man in the Middle: Maurice's first appearance with a lead vocal on the album. I love this song because it reflects how Maurice feels about himself in the group, leaving the listener with a more personal view of the Bee Gees. The music itself is also excellent with a very catchy chorus. Don't be surprised if you find yourself singing, \\"I'm just a man in the middle of a complicated plan...\\" after listening to it a couple of times.  <br />Déjà Vu: WHY WASN'T THIS RELEASED AS A SINGLE? This song has all the elements of a smash hit. Very upbeat and energetic with a nice lead by Robin, it would easily fit in with any top 40 record of today. Sadly, this gem was overlooked at single picking time.<br />Embrace: Exceptional effort on Robin's part. Beautifully written and performed, \\"Embrace\\" is easily one of the more enjoyable tracks on the album. <br />Voice in the Wilderness: Not an instant favorite, but it grows on you. I admire the Bee Gees for this adventurous new sound. A very fast paced track with an extremely energetic beat and a fantastic chorus. Very different, but very Bee Gees.<br />All in all, \\"This Is Where I Came In\\" is a wonderful effort from the Bee Gees. Compared to any recent releases from other established artists, (Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, etc...) this album is outstanding. I highly recommend that you at least give this album a listen and truly experience the magic of the Brothers Gibb.

Disc two with all the Behind the camera info was awesome. I always wonder about Darkness and how they made him so larger then life( in the movie). was it the camera angles or smaller set well this DVD  tells it all. I did wish tom cruise  was on this dvd . i mean come on,  i would hope if i was an actor i'd never get to big to come back to talk about arole i've done.<br /> I'm glad this movie at least gets therespect it deserves after critics panned iut but i'm sure as any movie gooer worth his or her weight in gold knows  ..

B00005JKCF|5.0|I'm not the world's biggest comic book fan but I don't exactly avoid them on purpose either.  But I really looked forward to seeing Spider-Man on the big screen in a serious modern-era movie.  And as far as super hero comic book characters turned into full length movies, this one didn't let us down.  Fans of the old show will miss the opening song, but Danny Elfman more than makes up for the missing piece of nostalgia with his continuing creativity in the scoring of movies.  Comic book perfectionists will complain about the slight changes that they made to the origins of Spider-man but to the average fan the changes are hardly noticeable.  These few shortfalls aren't nearly enough to knock this movie down even a single notch.  <br />The casting was one of the best jobs that I've seen.  Tobey Maguire took some time off from his more serious roles (The Cider House Rules) and could become THE nations next big super hero.  Kirsten Dunst has really come into her own over the last couple years and has the potential to become a very serious leading lady.  And the casting of William Dafoe as the \\"Green Goblin\\" was really the only way to go.  Aside from Christopher Walken, nobody can look that evil just by changing his facial expressions.  And even the small supporting roles added to the movie.  Macho Man Randy Savage's appearance as wrestler \\"Bone Saw\\" made me and my friends laugh for quite a while.  And the newspaper editor, while somewhat overacting, had the entire theatre laughing at once.  <br />The story itself doesn't really need a lot of explaining.  It's a well constructed story of how a simple kid grows to become the city's newest superhero.  A bite from a genetically altered spider causes changes in young Peter Parker's life.  His vision difficulties fade and he discovers strange new powers, such as the ability to climb walls and spin his own webs.  Peter Parker aside, William Dafoe's character and his transformation into the new super-villain The Green Goblin isa main focal point.  Dafoe's collapse from the top of the corporate world was explained very well and acted beautifully.  The story that evolves is a tangled web (ha-ha) of both actor's everyday characters and there respective alter-egos and the way all four personalties interact with each other.  All in all, the movie is a well paced action flick with a little bit of love story thrown in.  <br />There are a few warnings that go with this movie.  First, if you suffer from really bad motion sickness, I highly recommend motion sickness pills as a must have before watching this movie.  The other warning that I give is for people who don't like computer generated effects.  There are several shots in this movie that were obviously computer generated and although they looked good at times, some really looked fake.  I understand that they were necessary elements but I heard a few people complaining about it as we left the theatre.  And don't worry to much about it.  None of the shots were as bad as the airplane crash in \\"Air Force One\\".  Just a slight warning.  <br />Now on to the comparisons.  As far as the other superhero turned movie star, nothing can come close to Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and the entire \\"Superman\\" series is phenomenal for the time period that they were made in.  Compared to \\"X-Men\\" of a couple years ago, \\"Spider-man\\" was a much better movie.  I can only hope that \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" lives up to it's predecessors.  And compared to the other big Blockbusters already this year, this was way better than \\"The Scorpion King.\\" And although I haven't seen \\"Star Wars Episode 2\\" yet, my friends weren't to thrilled with that either.  So if you don't mind sitting in crowded theatre's \\"Spider-man\\" should be your choice for this summers earliest must see movie. <br />The Breakdown:<BR>1.  Plot-9 (well constructed story, well in tune with the comic)<BR>2.  Characters-9 (took a lot of time to develop almost every character)<BR>3.  Flow-9 (just a few lulls for a 2 hr. movie isn't that bad)<BR>4.  Atmosphere-10 (well constructed scenes as well as Danny Elfman's music is a big plus)<BR>5.  Cinematography-9 (excellent all around effects with a few minor glitches)<BR>6.  Entertainment Value-10 (2 hrs. just flew by)<BR>7.  Replay Value-9 (well worth seeing twice)<BR>8.  Casting/Character Depth-9 (doesn't get much better)<BR>9.  Relevance to genre-9 (great comic book turned movie, not quite as good as Batman)<BR>10.  X-factors-9 (they actually left Spider-man's costume alone instead of a stupid looking latex muscle suit- bravo)<br />92/100
B000001FN3|4.0|ToMaI is the very first \\"cassette\\" of APP that I purchased.  I actually found it in Korea over 20 years ago.  It has long since died (replaced by countless copies just before they died) and I am enthusiastically awaiting the arrival of the CD that I recently ordered. <br />Since ToMaI I have purchased almost all of APPs stuff, even tho I am not a \\"die hard\\" fan I really enjoy their stuff and they get played more than any of my other selections.  Recently buying a CD player, I now am replacing all my old cassettes with CDs of the groups I enjoy the most - providing I can still find them (which hasn't been easy for some!) <br />If you've never listened to APP - do so!!!  It'll change your way of listening to music forever!  Symphonic, techno, melodic, rocking, haunting, the list of one-word descriptions goes on.<BR>Enjoy APP and hopefully they'll keep making more, and more, and more.........
0553103547|5.0|What I really love about this book are the characters. Each chapter is writting from the perspective of a character so you really get to understand how they think. The characters are very realistic and complex.  Also you can plan on feeling very conected to the characters while you read this book.  When one of the characters is betrayed by a friend, or gets lost in a dark castle you feel like you're right there with them and it's happening to you.<br />I bad thing about A Game of Thones and the books following it is that the description of sexual activity is very explicid , and it is sometimes very bezaar.  I think George R. R. Martin uses the sex to help you better understand the characters in his book, but this objective would still be accomplished without the sex.  I sugjest you skip forward a page whenever you encounter a sexual scene.<br />The plot is good.  It has lots of activity and is fairly complex.  In the plot many things are going on in different places at once. One thing to be aware of before you start reading is that the first few hundred pages get you acquainted with the characters and setting so they are not as fast paced as the rest of the book.<br />A flaw in most fantasy is that all the major good people survive despite going throgh very dangerous circumstances. A Game of Thrones and the books following it are different.  In them main characters who are good sometimes die.<br />The intrigue in this novel is good but not comparable to a book like The Baker's Boy.<br />The thing I least like about this book is the religious perspective it is written from. Nearly every fantasy book I've read has the same demonic gods in it and is written from an eastern religious perspective. I would like it if more fantacy written by Christian authors was available. There are Christian fantasy books out there but they are not being published.
014028009X|1.0|How sad is that!!  Usually the book is always better than the movie, and I the movie wasn't that great either.<br />This book depressed me, I couldn't get thru it so I took it back to the library.  I wanted to understand what all the hype was about!!<br />Sorry! :(
B00005JKLZ|3.0|I once thought that only the most superlative of Science Fiction films could engender a black mood and that perhaps only the most sensitive of film buffs could detect it.  Okay, I was wrong.  Even though The Time Machine (2002) can't use its 22.5 million first weekend gross to spend on rave reviews, it does have a spark of adventure and I did feel the gray sky encroaching in the latter hour.  A+ for effort and the time spinning effects were marvelous!  Guy Pearce has already proven (LA Confidential, Memento) that his earnest histrionics were worth the big ticket and this time conveys his ability to be the unarchetypical male hero; exchanging gun-totin', foul mouthed witticisms for slick intellect and a cappuccino frothin' time ride.  Jeremy Irons plays a terrifically terrifying Morlock lord who obviously wasn't very hungry and feeling mucho catty to let a tasty morsel like Alexander walk.  If you've read HG Wells book of the same name then the story will have you reminiscing.  If you haven't then perhaps you may wonder what kind of web could spin such an unbelievable tale!  This movie might score a B- in some skeptics corners; but I doubt it.  Take the kids -- it is a well guarded PG-13 and the only suggestive moments are when Ms. Mumba makes a bad wardrobe call and one intense moment that proved:  you cannot change the past but can make earnest effort to enhance the opposite.  It'll scare the little ones and evoke imagination in the bigger ones.  I, on the other hand, found myself mapping out the sets while watching it (this happened during some parts of The Fifth Element although it was a better yarn).  Good sets and great sound track but if you aren't taking the kids then save it for DVD.
0316548189|5.0|This book was truly amazing.  I found myself observing Mandela's actions like a student, attentive to his process and noting his moments of success.  <BR>The writing was deeply personal, and yet, I loved how he would politely omit personal details that would strike at the honor of Winnie.  I still question her poor publicity as I read of her undying support for Nelson, the committment to her family burdens carried in solitaire while Nelson remained imprisoned.  <BR>This same honor and respect for other humans forged his deep committment to the liberation struggle.  He never once forgot his true purpose in leading his people.  He felt deeply the slights on anyone's freedom, be it man or woman, black or white.<BR>I also valued the insights into South African history.  It gave me a whole new perspective on how the South African nation has developed in the world of contemporary democracy.  Within the democractic framework, it was interesting to consider the affect of the media on society, at home and abroad.  Especially to look at what America and the UK were doing while South Africa worked though apartheid.<BR>This is a well-rounded, well-written and profoundly personal autobiography.  READ IT!
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Donnie suffers from a sleep disorder.  He often finds himself waking up in places he didn't fall asleep and his family is so accustomed to it that it's practically humorous.  Troubled teen takes new meaning when a demonic rabbit appears to Donnie and sends him down a road which will change not only his life but the lives of his community.  In therapy and on anti-psychotic drugs you are forced to decide whether the good Doc or drugs are helping or hindering.  Good Donnie or bad Donnie?  The decision shouldn't be a hard one while you waft through a parade of lifeless characters that seem to be gasping for breath only because it's second nature to keep trying.  A psychological thriller to say the least with some sci-fi thrown in for good measure.  A very interesting flick--not for those who dislike trying to figure it all out.  The official web site makes great use of flash but you'd have to watch the movie to understand it.
014028009X|4.0|For my British Literature class, I just finished Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  The book tells the story of a year in the life of an average, single, thirty-something British woman, who, armed with only her wits and charm (and a diary), goes in search of the ever-elusive Mr. Right.  Unlucky-in-love Bridget has two candidates: the fun and sexy Daniel Cleaver and the unfriendly Mark Darcy.  Not surprisingly, she goes for Daniel, but he turns out to be a less-than-perfect catch.  Then, just when she becomes interested in Mark (following his statement that he likes her just as she is), he begins dating Natasha, another lawyer, who is determined to marry him.  Meanwhile, her parents' marriage is on the rocks and she embarks upon a career in television news.  <br />There are many similarities between Bridget Jones's Diary and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  In both stories, the heroine is attracted to a charming rogue and repelled by his haughty former friend (whose name happens to be Darcy in both cases.) In both stories, the rogue wins her sympathy by telling her about all the rotten things his ex-friend did to him. But both heroines later discover that you can't believe everything you hear - and Darcy turns out to be the real charmer. With all these parallels, it isn't hard to determine that Helen Fielding is an Austen admirer, and that all of these similarities to Pride and Prejudice are intentional.   <br />This book is witty and hilarious, from Bridget's list of New Years Resolutions on page 1 to her summary of the year on page 271.  Furthermore, each of the characters is incredibly believable (especially Bridget), which makes it very easy for the reader to relate to this book.
0792844882|5.0|Showgirls, by Paul Verhoeven, is definatly the sleaziest movie ever made. But is is also really underrated. Showgirls is basicly a American Dream movie, about a girl who goes to a town to make it big. Showgirls is filled of nudity, but not very much hardcore sex. If you wanna see a so bad it is good movie, see this one.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem is lyrically the best hip hop artist of all time. Through his anger he expresses hate for anyone that has done him wrong, and yet in the same line he displays the love of his life. The only people that dislike eminem only do so because they cant see the truth or they don't want to. The only thing I would disagree on the entire album is in the song 'Til I Collapse', he states the best rappers of all time and then lists himself at the end. Anyone involved in the industry knows he is at the top of the list and his 3rd album proved it. This album will join his other two in the best hip hop albums of all time. Buy this album now!
B00006690G|4.0|After Eminem's huge success, the pressure was on him to match up his sophomore LP. The Eminem Show is Em's most mature album yet and some may easily think it's his best. He shows his personal side here with songs like Cleanin' Out The Closet, Hailie's Song (featuring a crooning Slim!), and Sing For The Moment. His lyrics are deep and heartfelt on these cuts. Even Em's haters have to give him credit for his opinions. The best songs are Say Goodbye Hollywood, White America, Say What You Say, Soldier and Business. I definately recommend this album if you are an Eminem fan or if you are just getting into him. This may not be his absolute best effort but it does challenge his best. Ladies and gentlemen, Marshall Mathers is a man!
B000060P79|5.0|I think that the simple plan album is off tha chain.It has so many good songs.One of my fave is \\"I'm just a kid\\".I can really relate to that song.I think everyone should go out and buy that cd because it's awesome and you can relate to some of the songs.GO BY THE CD,NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6303402348|5.0|I love, love, love this movie. Maybe I'm biased because I saw it for the first time when I was 10 with all my older cousins who loved it, and then I've seen about a zillion more times in the following 6 years. I'm 16 now. Tom Hanks is genius in this role, and it made me add him onto my list of &quot;favorite actors.&quot; (He was good in Castaway, too.) I also love the soundtrack - all the relevant songs from the time period. The special effects that put Forrest in all those different events were impressive as well - I can't say enough! This is one of the best movies ever made.
B00003CXI1|2.0|First off, please note that this is a review of the DVD itself;  not the movie.  The movie is good, and might as well have been a few bucks cheaper and sold as one disk.  Why?  Because the second disk was apparently designed by some sadistic idiot.  The box promises seven deleted scenes, something everyone that buys a DVD wants to see.  Trouble is, you can't just click on a \\"Deleted Scenes\\" menu;  you have to play some silly game!  Rather like playing Myst or some puzzle game, and only when you're done do you get to see the deleted scenes.  I didn't even bother to finish trying;  I just put the 2nd disk back in the box, and there it will stay until I tire of this DVD and sell it.  All in all, a staggeringly poor way to format bonus features;  shame on WB for doing this.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|While the storyline is not entirely original, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are good actors with the vocal talent to make up for it. It's not realistically set in the 1890's, either, but that didn't bother me too much. Good choreography, music, makeup, and costumes, as well. :)
B000006P8I|5.0|I agree with most that gravedigger is not worth the time of day but the other 11 are brilliant. For the pre Ziggy days its a work of art and matches even the beatles (but unrecognized). All Bowie fans should buy this it is a must.
0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath is a talented poet, but this was the first work of hers I read, when I was 12. It really blew me away. She is such a gifted writer: sensitive, descriptive, and darkly funny at times. Just don't read this if you're already in a bad mood - it WILL make you feel worse. It's way depressing, and especially to me because I too suffer from a mental illness. But a classic is a classic, and one of the best classics in my opinion.
B00001U0DP|4.0|Don't let the fact that this is a foreign film turn you away.  I had never seen a subtitled film &amp; thought I'd pass this one up.  I have to admit, I have no idea why, but just thought it may be too distracting.  Well, this movie is incredibly made and the story is incredibly told.  It is a must see!
B00006690G|5.0|I'm not a fan of rap music at all. But, over time I've sort of grown fond of eminem... so, when the cd came out, my big sis bought the cd for me. I had it for a whole five seconds when I decided that it was the best cd I'd bought since getting Nine Inch Nails' \\"and all that could have been\\". It's got tons of great songs.
059030271X|5.0|\\"Charlottes Web\\" was one of my favorite books growing up. My grandmother gave it to me when I was 9-years-old, and I read it so often after that, I would make tabulations on my bookmark of how many times I had read it per day.<br />Not only did I become a bookworm, but part of my love for animals came from this book. I mean, its hard not to get attached to Wilbur, the runt pig 8-year-old Fern Arable \\"save[s] from an untimely death\\", or Charlotte A. Cavatica, the clever, imaginative gray spider who fools everybody into believing Wilbur is a special pig by spinning flattering words about him in her web so hes not butchered, or even Templeton, the sarcastic, self-centered rat who is somewhat of a help later on.<br />One year after it was published, \\"Charlottes Web\\" was named a Newbery Honor book. During the 70s, it won the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal and was later made into a movie. Although its been several years since Ive seen the cartoon, I do remember that I really enjoyed it. Not more than the book, of course, but its worth checking out if you liked this story.<br />Recommended for readers age 8+.
6304981635|5.0|It really bugged me that Black Belt Jones got iced, but what the hey.  Excellent martial arts film, the cornerstone to any afficionado's DVD collection.
B000006XSD|3.0|What a strange record this is.  I hadn't listened to this since it came out (I lost the vinyl years ago), and, for some reason, had to have it again for \\"It's Hot Tonight.\\"  Tower in NYC had it as a German import CD.<br />The sound:  I don't think WEA Europe did anything to the tapes they obtained, because it sounds like they just used the master tapes used to make the vinyl lp.  I'm not an engineer, but you can tell that the sound is all wrong at points.  <br />Not that the original mix didn't have problems, like the song selection, it's all over the map.  As Dick Wagner observed in an interview not long ago, the record lacks continuity; however, what you do get is some pretty extraordinary material.<br />Which is why this record deserves a bit more care--it should be remastered and remixed--there's too much good that's buried here.  And while the reviews below map at where this record goes wrong, a good re-mix would define where it goes right--the playing is superb and the production is a fairly robust Bob Ezrin outing.<br />This would be the last of the Cooper/Wagner/Ezrin collaborations for some time, as life in LA took its toll on all of these players; however, they got the job done, fuelled by talent, money, and, most likely, a rather potent mix of chemicals, which LA was fairly swimming in at the time (not that it isn't now :-).
B000001E7V|5.0|It's definitely the sexiest album ever made - with the cool mood and \\"hummed\\" lyrics so typical for Tricky. Gotta have it!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I fell in love with this CD. I love the fact that she writes from her heart and her experiences. Anyone can relate to her songs because they're real. My favorite songs are \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and \\"Misery\\" [where she does a wonderful duet with Areosmith's lead singer, Steven Tyler]. Everyone should own this CD!!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|i bought this album about 7 months ago. <BR>i'm still crazy about it. i enjoy pretty much anything  by radiohead, but this album holds a special place in my cd collection. with it's ambient-like waves of sound, choice lyrics, and captivating instrumentation, this is definitely one of those rare and great albums. for anyone willing to have a new experience, give this a try. despite the many negative reports from other radiohead fans, i consider this yet another masterful work of art, even if it is an aberration from the more familiar 'rock' sound.
B000056K04|5.0|I never listened to DMB in the 80's and 90's (too main-stream for me).  So I had no pre-conceived ideas about what they should sound like when I took my 12 year old daughter to a DMB concert a week ago.  I was amazed at how great the music was. I came home and borrowed my daughter's cd (Everyday).  I can't stop listening to it. It is the best music out right now.  I only have one complaint.  That is, at the live show the musicians-especially the fantastic violin and sax. players-got to play more.  It would have been perfect if more of that had been included on the cd. I think people should stop comparing this cd to the old stuff. Artists have to grow and change.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The 2 disc Harry Potter DVD is a great value.  In addition to the widescreen version of the acclaimed movie, there is also a second disc with special features, such as deleted scenes and a tour of the Hogwarts castle.  On the DVD-ROM, there are various computer features as well.  I enjoyed playing through the mini-games.<br />I have one complaint however, which is why I rated this four stars instead of five.  In order to view the deleted scenes, you first have to win the game on the second disc (which takes a little over half an hour).  The deleted scenes should have been directly accessible from the DVD's menu.
B000002H92|4.0|From the first track you know you are in for a treat.  An unruly and uncooperative crowd has surged into the aisles and front rows in \\"House Announcer\\" in anticipation of the band, and it's exactly the tone and mood that will take you through an incredible and exotic journey of 31 tracks of rock & roll, cabaret, performance art, and poetry readings.<br />The Celebration of the Lizard (King), tracks 13 through 19, are perhaps the highlight of this album.  Morrison's poetry rings true to the feeling of the uncertainty of the era, shamanism, Greek tragedy, and mysticsm reminiscent of Omar Khayyam, all backed by a hard rock band that had few peers equal to the drums of Densmore, the classically trained guitar style of Krieger, and magician-like hands of Manzarek playing a bass line on one keyboard and simultaneous rythm/lead on another.<br />Other highlights for In Concert include an extended version of \\"The End\\" that supercedes the studio version in its soul and ambience.  Also, the Doors lighten up the dark mood set by their more epic pieces, excellent unto themselves (\\"When The Music's Over\\", \\"Light My Fire\\" w/ an excellent inclusion of the brooding and picteresque \\"The Graveyard Poem\\"), with fun versions of \\"Dead Cats\\"/\\"Break On Through\\" and \\"You Make Me Real\\".<br />The list goes on and on, song after song of a band that was moving forward in its abilities and destined for something even greater and more unique, halted by the death of their charismatic and insufferable lead singer Jim Morrison.  Note the comparisons of this album to other live albums, and you will see \\"In Concert\\" is a little bit of everything, a comprehensive collection of the \\"better\\" live recordings available commercially.<br />At the time this album was issued, my initial reaction to some of the song selections was of slight dissapointment.  Yet many bootlegs and live Doors albums later, \\"In Concert\\" now reigns supreme and is a trusted old friend.
0930289528|5.0|Don't let the medium fool you. What may look like a comic book ( or &quot;Graphic novel&quot; to give it the oh-so-pretentious moniker that collections of comic books gained in the 1980's ) is actually one of the finest novels to come out of the 1980's. It is at once a retro-futuristic thriller, an alternate history of England in the 1990's, an homage to the likes of Orwell, Huxley and Guy Fawkes and a story of personal liberation ( and the inherent responsibilities that come with it  ). The more eagle-eyed amongst you will recognise deft acknowledgements to the likes of Arthur Koestler, The Rolling Stones, The Stockholm Syndrome and even the enigmatic 60's television series, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. The &quot;Valeries Letter&quot; sequence alone is worth the price of purchase. England Prevails, as do Alan Moore and David Lloyd.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is the best rap album I've ever heard. The way every song leads to another, it takes you on an emotional journey that reveals Eminem's personal life. From Stan to Criminal this album has a wide variety of types of raps. It will still be selling in another 25 years. A classic, buy it now before it gains value. The only negative thing I could say about this album is it's going to be impossible for Eminem to top it.
B00005PJ8I|2.0|Yes, yes, yes, Tom Hanks lost forty pounds to play a man marooned on an island for four years. It is too bad the director did not put that much effort into making a better movie.<br />This is one of those films that you like when the end credits roll, then wake up in the middle of the night and wonder why you suddenly dislike it.<br />There are over 400 other reviews on this site for this film, so I will spare you another detailed summary of the plot. When it comes right down to it, the plot is very minimal at best. On to the complaining:<br />Why does Zemeckis insist on using special effects for the most mundane scenes? I thought the Oscar winning effects for \\"Forrest Gump\\" were lousy. The scene I am talking about is an obvious CGI fish swimming in the water before getting speared by Hanks, who is dramatically thin after four years. Why the effect? A fake fish on string would have been more realistic.<br />What I disliked most about this film was the missed opportunities. Where was the scene where Hanks gets on the boat and explains his appearance? His reaction to loud noises after being on a tropical island alone? His reaction to getting back on a plane after going down in a plane at the beginning of the film? His inability to drive a car after four years of not being able to? I also would have liked to see Hanks gradually get used to island life. Instead, he stumbles around like Gilligan, then we jump forward four years later where he looks like a caveman, and is an old pro at island life. Couldn't we see how he adjusts? We know he is going to be rescued, so we are left with muddled scenes regarding his reunification with love of his life Helen Hunt, who is better in this than \\"What Women Want.\\"<br />Where is the emotional reuniting of the pair, instead of the strained meeting when he goes to their house? She still has all of his stuff from the unsuccessful search, and his car, and yet he must go to her.<br />I really did not like the ambiguous ending. Normally,ambiguous endings are the result of the film makers deciding to do something different than the Hollywood norm. Here, it just seems that no one knew how to end this. Having Hanks look back up the road where Lori White had driven is nice, but what was in the package he left at her door? Sure, he is at a crossroads emotionally as well as physically, but the film makers try to be mysterious by leaving him there. Do not take me through two and a half hours with this guy, then leave the both of us hanging on a dirt road in Texas. Closure, darn it!<br />I cannot recommend \\"Cast Away,\\" despite the marketing and reputations of the cast and crew.<br />This is rated (PG13) for physical violence, gore, some profanity, and some adult situations.

B00000253N|5.0|...this is a great album, probably one of Bob's three or four best.  The Dude's voice is perfect for the tone of this heartfelt album.  The story song <BR>\\"Tangled up in Blue,\\" and the angry \\"Idiot Wind,\\" are the two most famous songs, and they are wicked good.  \\"If You See Her Say Hello,\\" and \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\\" are standouts and exemplars of the sad and regretful (but still rockin) mood of the album.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|Since this is a best hits collection, I'm doing this review for all those who haven't gotten a single album from The Corrs. (You living under a bed rock or something??) The Corrs' unique Irish pop music is simply supernatural...and why not? These talented siblings from Ireland compose, play and sing their own songs. Before, I was already expecting (and hoping as well) that they would release their best hits collection....Thanks God they did.<br />From the 18 tracks, 3 songs are remix versions. Trust me, the original versions are much better than the remix ones. Even so, I'm giving them 5 stars for this (must have been a 4.5). The best Corrs' song for me will always be &quot;Runaway&quot;. This love song shows Andrea's soothing voice and the remarkable tinkling of the piano. The second one will be &quot;Radio&quot;. It's a good thing that the unplugged version of &quot;Radio&quot; is included here; I don't prefer the &quot;Radio&quot; version from their In Blue album. Caroline's natural drumming is present in this song. Speaking of unplugged songs, they also included an acoustic cover of &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and the poignant &quot;Lough Erin Shore&quot; (Of their instrumental tracks, I like &quot;Toss the Feathers&quot; best). There are also their first classic releases, &quot;I Never Loved You Anyway&quot;, the plaintive and memorable tune of &quot;Only When I Sleep&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot;. &quot;Give Me A Reason&quot; is like another rendition of the positive-sounding &quot;Breathless&quot;. However, I enjoy listening to Sharon's violin solo there. &quot;Irresistible&quot; is a unique modern pop song which talks about admiration.<br />Other songs which make up this beautiful collection are &quot;Forgiven Not Forgotten&quot; and &quot;Would You Be Happier&quot;. If I can change some songs in here, I'd change the remix versions and replace &quot;Lough Erin Shore&quot; with &quot;Toss the Feathers&quot; and add &quot;At Your Side&quot; (another unplugged song). Still, this is a good album and I bet that you're all gonna enjoy their music.
B0000024RZ|3.0|Not one of The Dude's best.  I will admit that I prefer the \\"rock\\" bob, to the \\"folk\\" bob, but I if you want to sample his folk days get the more personal \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan\\" or \\"Blowin in the Wind,\\" and skip this one.  It is very much an example of his protest stage, which is fine, but it just isn't nearly as good musically as a lot of his other work.  There's nothing to sing along too, although some of the tracks are interesting to listen to soley to hear Bob's opinions on different issues, agree or disagree with him.  \\"Only A Pawn in Their Game\\" is about how, in Bob's opinion, the rich Southern whites have and are using the poor Southern whites as tools against the blacks, even though racism doesn't profit the poor Southern whites, and the rich ones are the ones who benefit.  \\"Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" about poverty and violence is also good.
0448060191|5.0|Little Women is a charming story that transports back in time and tells the story of the March family. It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise  pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more.
B0000025GW|5.0|I think some Bob fans are unfairly prejudiced against this album because it came out during his born-again Christian days, and therefore haven't given it a chance.  Too bad for them, because this is one of his best works.  After a few mediocre releases, Bob is focused and very inspired of &quot;Slow Train.&quot;  His voice has rarely sounded so good as it does on &quot;Precious Angel.&quot;  The fun &quot;Man Gave Names to All the Animals,&quot; the gospel twinged &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody,&quot; and the admittedly preachy, but fiery and powerful &quot;When You Gonna Wake Up,&quot; are all great.  True, Bob is preaching a bit on this one, but it's not like he didn't do that on his early folk albums (Bob never &quot;pusyfoots around,&quot; as he once said, and if he means something he is not going to try to be polite about it, but give it to you straight as he see's it), it's just that he has a different view point on this one, and since it is fundamentalist Christian, it's not cool, and some won't even try it.  Again, too bad for them because lyrically and musically this is a wicked good album, and one of Bob's most inspired.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I'm a 30 something fan of Harry Potter, but I conciously decided not to read any books until seeing the movie. Sure, it's not as good, but movies never are.<br />The DVD is very well presented, the tabs that hold the discs in are too stiff for my liking, it's just a matter of time until it breaks. The discs are very well laid out. Disc 1, just the movie, language selections and cast list. Disc 2 is enormous, you can't just browse either, you have to play around, catch the snitch, tap the wall @ Diagon Alley, etc, in order to see more stuff. I would say that this presentation has been designed to enhance the whole experience for the Potter die hard.<br />If you are looking for 'making of featurette's' and director's commentry, wait for the next version of the DVD (not that I know anything, I'm just guessing)
B0000640S1|5.0|In an age of cinema largely ruled by computer generated wizardry, FIRST BLOOD is a welcome throwback to an area where technologically created villains didn't yet exist.<br />In the simplest version of a story ever told, boy (John Rambo) meets boy (Wilford Teasle), boy (Teasle) hates boy (Rambo), and testosterone breaks out all over the place.  After refusing to be run out of town, John Rambo is roughed up by several redneck police officers in the Pacific Northwest (what are they doing with rednecks?).  Before you can say \\"pass the ammo,\\" this former Special Forces Green Beret is enduring a flashback to his glory days in Vietnam, and the town will never be the same ... literally.<br />On board are Sylvester Stallone (back in the days when he was a 'serious' actor), the incomparable Brian Dennehy (who's starting to appear as regularly as Michael Caine in films), and Richard Crenna.  Also, as a guilty pleasure, look for the youthful redheaded cop who's none other than David Caruso in his pre-NYPD BLUE days.<br />What works best about FIRST BLOOD is the tension-filled story of unrelenting action; once this film reaches a fever pitch, it truly never lets up.  As the producers discuss in the documentary accompanying the film, FIRST BLOOD really set the standard for all other action films to follow.  Upon this most recent viewing, the influence of this franchise on other similar outings is readily apparent.<br />A dynamic presentation, the Dolby 5.1 sound leaves a bit to be desired (as does the DTS).  However, the commentary track (featuring best-selling FIRST BLOOD author David Morrell) is a fabulous exploration of the book-to-screen cycle so prevalent in Hollywood, sprinkled with tidbits about the movie-making process, actors originally attacked to the roles of Rambo and his mentor (Colonel Samuel Trautman), and (believe it or not) the use of iconographic and mythological symbols in the telling of the first (and best) of the Rambo tales.<br />The extras here (a new documentary, production notes, etc.) are fairly standard fare, but the preservation of the film is worth the price of at least the first installment of this popular feature film franchise.entary, production notes, etc.) are fairly standard fare, but the preservation of the film is worth the price of at least the first installment of this popular feature film franchise.
B000002OR4|5.0|I saw Schindler's List last summer during a day when I had nothing else to do... my mom thought I was horrible for liking such a (as she says) morbid movie. But there was something about it that haunted me. I've always been interested in the Holocaust which is probably the biggest reason why I liked it... However, the other day I was out renting videos and I decided to watch it again. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes. But when I watched it this second time, I realized that the music itself was what made me want to see it again, and when that theme plays I just have to reach for the Kleenex..<BR>A definite must-have.
B0000640VO|5.0|yet another fabulously artistic film by jean-pierre jeaunet, \\"amelie\\" reached a part of my soul. i must admit i'm a little obsessive compulsive when it comes to seeing it - especially at the ticket price we have to pay in nyc, BUT, it's so well worth the zillion dollars i've spent on multiple viewings. if i could personally take everyone to the theater to see it, trust me, i would. it just felt so alive as a film. i'm an artist and when i left the theater, i felt this rejuvenated passion in my life. maybe that's why i like seeing it so much. i could also identify with amelie's quirks and intricacies. she was just an intriguing character to me, and the story is divine. GO SEE IT!! here, i'll add some more stars, so you'll be sure to go ************ okay, there. now you have no excuse. it's simply brilliant - enjoy!
B00003CXI1|3.0|OK, this review is for disk 2 not the movie. The movie is GREAT! There is no doubt about that. Anyone who says it isn't really hasn't seen it! But disk 2 might be something you want to read about before getting involved in all the searching your going to be doing to find the deleted scenes, which is a shame. I don't know why they don't just add these scenes right into the DVD movie and see where they belong. Anyway, if your over 10 this 2nd DVD will drive you NUTS!!! You have to search for the S. Stone! You have to go to one place buy a wand, then go to another section and find where to look to get to the stone, and you can't do any of this without buying a wand. Oh and don't forget to go to the bank and get your money, but wait first you have to find the key!! UUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!! The whole thing was a waste of time! And myself being 3,9 I don't want to play a video game you know I just want to watch the movie and see the missing 7 scenes. It's a crime after all WE put these books on the NY Times bestseller list, WE made the movie #1, and WB should have had more respect for the Adults that don't have time..nor waste it playing a video game to get to see these scenes. If I wanted to play a viedo game I would go out and but the Harry Potter Game..HELLO WB ANYBODY HOME!!! If you want to build a kids gamne do it, but not on a DVD that most people don't wanrt to deal with. Alot of work went into this disk, and alot of cool stuff on it, but not for adults more for kids. Next one guys if your reading don't do it like this, let it be for all of us and put the delete stuff where we can just find it, like most of the BETTER movies companies do.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|When movies end, I feel either satisfied (but oblivous to the fact that it actually [stunk]) or it just generally [stunk]. I've grown so used to movies that 'satisfy' me that watching this movie practically blew me AWAY! It wasn't a type of movie that you'd like to watch and understand, it's a type of movie that you'd like to watch once and try to get it at the point. For me, that's what made it so interesting. When I first saw this, like a couple of weeks ago, it just fascinated me to how the movie was edited. And that even though there are so many jumps and skips, the story was still intact and kept the viewers interested through out the whole thing. I mean, when I was watching it, my younger brother and sister were just roaming around making noises while I tried to concentrate on the movie. Sometimes, they'll barge in at the scene change like when he's having one of his flashbacks etc. and talk to me and my parents. Then they ask us what's going on, and we'd be like, \\"uh, it's difficult to explain.\\" Well it's true, it is difficult to explain! It's not just a reason for them to go away, but it's one of the most CONFUSING (yet the BEST) movie I've ever watched in my life! That's what makes this movie probably one of those movies that could be repeated a hundred years later, and still be good. These kind of movies are the type of movies that are the most thought of and most planned out; that's why it IS so GOOD! I'd watch it again, but I wouldn't. The magic of it is still too powerful that am afraid that once I get it (the movie; and I did get, but it's still not clear) it'll all make sense and bring me back on this path of 'boredom' if you know what I mean. So overall, I am giving this movie 5 STARS for it's the movie that can't be made any better!
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is a really good movie. Before I saw it, I thought it was about an annoying ditz pretending to be smart-however, it is now one of my favorite movies. It's also a great movie to watch after getting dumped (trust me, I know this from experience). In Legally Blonde, Elle Woods, a sorority girl who is a fashion major, gets dumped by her boyfriend, Warner, because she is not serious enough for him. She decides to show him that she is indeed serious by going to Harvard Law School. Everyone (especially Warner) assumes she will fail but she gets the ultimate revenge-proving all of them wrong and becoming a great lawyer. Reese Witherspoon was hilarious in this movie. I was laughing the whole time. She is one of those rare people who can be intelligent and funny and still look good doing it. Luke Wilson was also good-a great contrast to Elle's first boyfriend in the movie, Warner. This is a great girl power movie. Even though the whole basis of it seems a little farfetched, it still has several great messages-that everyone has the potential to succeed if they work for it, and not to judge people by appearences. Also, the DVD has a lot of cool extra features (several behind the scenes featurettes and a lot of funny deleted scenes). I actually bought it after renting it because I liked it so much. This movie is great for all blondes (and everyone else, too)!
0385335482|4.0|I don't know what Helen Fielding has started, but it seems to be big.  Since Bridget Jones came out there seem to be a mulititude of ... knock-offs like Jemima J and Getting Over It.  So, when my roommate gave me Confessions of a Shopaholic I was pretty sure it would be another lame attempt at the Brit Chick genre.  I actually thought that it would be the worst one yet since it dealt with something as trivial as shopping.  However, I have to admit that Sophie Kinsella really suprised me with this one.  It was actually funny!  At times Becky was a bit too much with her pathological lying, but Kinsella was still able to make her likeable.  It doesn't quite top Bridget Jones, but it is certainly comparable in the amount of enjoyment I had reading it.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem has come back in major way. He is on the top of his lyrical game on this album. Songs like \\"Superman\\" (...) \\"Til' I Collapse\\" and \\"White America\\" show this. The only thing that kinda disappointed me was the content. Everything is almost basically the same as the last two albums to a certain extent. He still talks about his mom, Kim, and his love for his daughter Hailie. It's starting to get a bit repetitive. He himself has realized this and has mentioned in a very recent MTV interview that he no longer wants to linger on these things any longer. That's where the song \\"Cleaning out my closet\\" comes in. He getting everything off his chest for the last time so he can out it behind him and I'm pretty postive that on his next album we won't see these characters pop up in the subject matter of his songs again.<br />My fave song is \\"Superman\\". It's been getting hated on by many, but I can't get enough of it. His flow is so hot on this song, and he delivers great lyrical skill in it. You have to really pay attention to how well crafted that song was put together. Great stuff. Go buy this album!!!
068484267X|2.0|After 52 pages, I had to stop reading. My free time is too precious. And I feel terrible about the money spent -- I now have a renewed commitment to use the library.<br />If you want to read an intelligent, compelling memoir I'd highly recommend Jill Ker Conway's &quot;The Road from Coorain.&quot; And an absolutely incredible book about diaries and memoirs is Alexandra Johnson's &quot;The Hidden Writer.&quot; Another great memoir is Kathleen Norris's &quot;The Cloister Walk.&quot; These are just a few that come to mind.
0553208845|5.0|Hermann Hesse tracks Siddhartha, a Brahmin's faithful son, in his quest for spiritual fulfillment. How does one encounter the inner God? Siddhartha meets a variety of people, each with their own philosophies on reaching this spiritual fulfillment, this Nirvana. The most important lesson Siddhartha learns is that some things cannot be taught; only discovered.<br /> The novel takes the reader to so many different locales that it could almost be considered an epic. The fact separating Siddhartha from the genre is the focus of the plot is not on epic happenings, but rather personal growth. Siddhartha attempts to discover many aspects of life such as business, love, and family. Siddhartha learns all the skills of the practical world, while seeking a skill that is not so applicable, the ability to reach inner peace.<br /> Hilda Rosner's translation of Hesse's work captures the contrasting language of the novel. Descriptions are often curt, but the dialogue of the characters is as lyrical as a religious text. In effect, Rosner hints to the reader not to focus so much on the character's surroundings and actions, but on their thoughts and motives.<br /> The search for sublime happiness and inner peace continues in many cultures while many more abandon it. Siddhartha argues that such satisfaction is personal in nature, and just as each human being is unique, so too is their method of finding enlightenment.
B00005NW02|3.0|OK, so I've listened to this over and over and over again, thanks to my best friend who insists its the greastest thing he's heard since the initial Pantera.  Come on.  The riffs are so clearly stolen from early 90s, and the vocals, so obviously would not exist without Primus to Defy The Laws of Tradion.  So disappointed.  Someday, someone gets a clue, apparently not in my lifetime. I miss Bradley so much.
0679601686|5.0|Pride And Prejudice, written by Jane Austen, is an amazing work on the nature of love.  Austen uses beautiful language and intriguing characters to tell this story of courtship in a time when reputation was everything.  The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is a clever-witted woman who manages to gracefully glide through the lines set up by society.  Although she does not always come off as lady-like, her charm and confidence demand the reader's respect.  She is surrounded by a cast of diverse characters, creating a riveting plotline.  Her mother is a rather quirky character who wants nothing more than to see her daughters wed.  Her father, on the other hand, is a sarcastic and intelligent man who favors Elizabeth for her wit.  These characters are brought together with the Bingley's when Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley.  Here, we are introduced to the stubborn and proud character of Mr. Darcy.  He seems to be above everyone else and completely opposed to the idea of love.<br />  When Elizabeth Bennet catches Darcy's eye, however, a battle between the mind and the heart begins.  These two chracters are faced with the obstacles set up by a strict, Victorian society.  Their largest obstacle, however, will be to overcome their own pride and prejudice, and discover their love for one another.  Is this a battle that the heart can win?
B00003CXSP|1.0|I am ashamed to have seen such an antipathy of a motion picture. Was this film directed by Ridley Scott even with a try to produce? Aversion! Hannibal Lector (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is hiding in a reclusive location. Sweden? Italy? Don't know. I could care less. The movie moves at an excruciating slow pace and Clarice (played by Julianne Moore this time) seems stiff and moves around like cadaver). Ultra ennui! She has searched for Dr. Lector for many years and she should've has closed the case after \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", a good movie. This movie is truly sickening with its amount of gruesomeness even Jason Voorhees would find lewd! The deformed man that wanted to get revenge on Dr. Lector was just extra malady! By the way, I don't want to get near a pig pen ever! After watching this freak show, I lost my appetite for the rest of the day and ended up not eating for a month. If this is your kind of playground, then by all means dig in! Distasteful, no yummy!
074322454X|5.0|This book is about the 101st airborne division. This book starts with training, where all the characters get to know each other. The plot then takes them to behind the lines in D-Day, through to the Ardenes and operation market garden in Holland. This book has recently been made into a hit TV series showing just how goo it is.

B0000029DD|5.0|I had heard Jeff Buckley's rendition of Hallelujah (by Leonard Cohen) previously, though never did I know who the artist was.  Then in the space of about three weeks, Buckley's version was used in a television episode of &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; and then on &quot;The West Wing.&quot;  It was so perfect, so fitting in those contexts.  I had no idea who wrote it, who sung it, but I had to find out.  After some searching, I was able to track it to Jeff Buckley's debut album, &quot;Grace.&quot;  The song is unique, incredible and as perfect as a song can be.
0345442989|3.0|I order this book about a year ago and gave up. It is only until now, when I had nothing else to read that I was forced to struggle through it. Luceno uses confusing words like 'diatribe' that only confuse the reader. It's ending was somewhat intriguing which is why it escaped two stars or less. It had great potential but Luceno spent too much time describing unrelated areas of information at a completely irrelevant time. Overall, good story potential, bad writing style.
