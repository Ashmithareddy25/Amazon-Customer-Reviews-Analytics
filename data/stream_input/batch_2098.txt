B00B2V66VS|5.0|Even better than the first one... I thought that would be hard to do... You gotta try this out, you will love it...
B00138J8EC|5.0|This a a beautiful collection of music that captures the mood and events of the movie.  Enjoyed it very much!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|well its ok but when u restart, u have to go back and get the pots of gold but in leps world 2 only have to get them back when u lose ALL ur lives. also, it doesnt show how many lives u have so far. i think u should get 2. the graphics are better as well.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. First one I have of Baldacci and will certainly buy more. Recommend to Patterson fans, this is a good read.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|I love this movie and I was very happy to find it on Amazon with the ability to rent it!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen, Paris, Owen Wilson, Magic transporting us all back to 1920's Paris. Great charters and fun plot. Love love love it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am not a MAC user nor did I know much of the story about Apple but this book is not about Apple - its about a brilliant yet ruthless man that many consider the genius of our time.  The book is very good - a bit slower in the middle but then picks up.  I think this could have easily been broken up into 2 books.  Overall - excellent book!
B005HP2J66|5.0|It takes you back 40,000 years. I first saw this in the movie theater in 3-D, but it is still pretty fantastic on the home screen. Good for all ages, but Werner Herzog narrates, and sometimes he is pretty difficult to understand. Get it anyway!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|As a first time computer builder, I found this component to give great performance at a reasonable price. Highly recommend!<br />Not that I will, but really like the overclocking option.
B00280LYIM|5.0|It was a very interesting book.  Full of suspense and action. Full of twists and turns every chapter right up to the very end.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This was purchased for our animal-loving daughter who was five at the time but uninterested in seeing it (?????)<br /><br />We brought it out a year later and played it and she LOVED it...LOVES it :)<br /><br />A good, sweet movie with a lovely ending.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it more than I can say. I literally almost cried all the end. Can't wait to start the next one.
6305657947|1.0|I'm sure the story is good.  My husband would talk about it on occasion...not remembering the story but remembering that he liked the movie.  He saw a *rated* version at the theatre (before we met)...as, it seems, did Roger Ebert since his review states that Brosnan and Russo never sleep together.  Not in the version we have!  I was actually uncomfortable enough to fast forward through the raunchy parts but they left such a bad taste in my mouth, I don't want to watch the movie again.<br /><br />Sure...fine...say it...  Prude.<br /><br />Not a big fan of watching that kind of thing.<br /><br />UPDATE: Watched it again with my hubby at his nudging to give it one more try...  We passed over the raunch and I still wasn't impressed...  I don't know if it's because the acting seems forced or what...<br /><br />Yes...clever plot, but hubby suggested seeing the original (we've only seen the remake).  I didn't know this was a remake...originals are always better in my opinion. I've researched the reviews for the original Thomas Crown Affair and it seems to be well-received so I'll be ordering that one soon and will update after viewing.
B00683JK9K|3.0|Magic Puzzles are fun. Wish I had more free ones to choose from. Love the background music that accompanies the puzzle.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|I like Roger Ebert's final statement in his review of this movie:  &#34;Films like 'Speed' belongs to the genre I call Bruised Forearm Movies, because you're always grabbing the arm of the person sitting next to you.&#34;<br /><br />Ha!  So true!!  An adrenaline-ridden ride.  Hold on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!to the person next to you ;)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing.  The twists and turns will keep you on your toes.  It's a must read. Can't wait for book 3!!!!!!!!!
1568363850|5.0|It was delivered quickly and the book looked brand new with the cd included. This is a very good book if you are a beginner like me. Even if you don't have a japanese teacher you can easly follow the exercise with the cd.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game. I love that it is challenging never boring. I downloaded it for the kids but I play it more then they do.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I play it when I want to pass some time. It works well. There are a large amount of bonus &#34;vehicles&#34; from dragons to Harleys.
1592407889|1.0|I learned the hard way not to believe every tale of childhood abuse and neglect. My own daughter went into therapy and \\"remembered\\" that I used to beat her with a flyswatter when she did not do well in her piano lessons. IT NEVER HAPPENED!!! Rather, MY mom had done that to me, and I had told my daughter about my experiences. Her counselor \\"helped\\" her internalize that experience, and now I am a villain who will never be forgiven until I apologize! Look up \\"false memory syndrome\\" and see how the mind can shape it's own \\"reality.\\"
B005LAIISA|5.0|Loved this sequel to Ice AGe.  I do hope that they make more sequels as the story cannot end just yet.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very good book once you really read more of it, or else it will be confusing to you. Don't skip chapters
0345803493|5.0|I enjoyed the story portion of this book. I am sure most people read the book for the sexual stuff. But that is not a seller for the book to me.
B000002JOH|1.0|This is one of the absolute worst albums of all time, from one of the worst bands of all time. This is the ultimate poser album (as Pantera themselves were posers who changed styles constantly to make money) . Pseudo-tough guy posturing, neanderthal lyrics about 'respect', terrible sub par drumming, and border line downs syndrome riffs all come together in the ultimate hillbilly album for people who think they are into metal, but have NO CLUE about real metal.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I had all characters unlocked and all the money in the world. the app whitescreened and then all my progress was gone... Thanks!
B0082LUEW8|1.0|Anyone who listens to this is a knuckledragging redneck mouth breather. If you think this is 'metal', you have no clue what metal is. Stick with NASCAR you mouthbreathing rednecks.
B00A6SZRGS|5.0|This has to be hands down one of the best albums of the year and the year just started awesome job bvb
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I first seen this movie in its entirety on kindle fire he. I haven't read any of the books, but did enjoy this movie. I'm not much of a movie buff so I'm not sure of any criticism that should or should not be added to this. In general I would recommend this title if I was asked of my thoughts on it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Mario brothers without any trademark violations, that's what this is. Lots of fun, although the controls on the screen sometimes make stop jumps or moving on all platforms hard. Great effort though. Lots of good playtime.kind of addicted to it recently.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another fast-read romantic novel by Nicholas Sparks.  A little suspenseful in the end.  Can't wait to see the movie.  All the hopeless romantics will definitely enjoy this.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game, especially for a side scrolled. Lots to do, spend what you get on, upgrade. Different jetpack, outfits, gadgets that do things from quirky to useful. You can also pick up stuff while playing that is fun, like suits that defy gravity to a desirable Dragon. It also has things that even make dying entertaining, allowing you to fling the body of your guy farther.<br /><br />Worth trying
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I was curious about the case of this local girl, and was astounded by her vigilance in making her life ordinary, while living a nightmare. She should be rewarded for overcoming such circumstances.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Good. good. good. good I<br /><br />Good good good good good good good good good good<br /><br />Good good I am required for the only way I have t. Good
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This s book has kept me up many a night in sheer anticipation. Hard to stop reading during any part. Come on Riordan, Book four before an angry mob arises.
0984183523|5.0|Mr Cheng's book is filled with great insights on how management consulting recruting and work really is in real life.<br /><br />I've been in management consulting for quite a while now and belive that consultants can really benefit from some of the chapters in the book. Specially those that explore how the logic of caseinterviews relate to the work consultants do.<br /><br />For candidates, the target audience of the book, it is a gem. I have recommended this book alone for friends that are trying to break into consulting.<br /><br />On top of that, Mr Cheng's website (caseinterview.com) has some really good extra material on various aspects of the recruiting process and life for new hires.
0385338732|5.0|Five Star Book!<br /><br />It is hard to explain to somebody why I love these witty, humorous, fast reads but really that is just it. When there is a writer like Sophie Kinsella who can take serious situations- memory loss in this case- and make them into fun stories of adventure you get entertainment.<br /><br />This book would be great for:<br />Before Bedtime Reading<br />Beach<br />Vacation<br />best for ages 18-45<br />Recently married individuals<br />and many others who like books like The Devil Wears Prada and Confessions of a Shopaholic
034580404X|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey,  Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed are amusing, entertaining, different, fast reading and just damn good entertainment.  I am anxiously awaiting more from E. L. James.  I plan on reading all three books again.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The book was awesome! I could not put it down. I am excited about the movie coming out as well!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Everytime I thought the movie was devilving into a sappy well worn storyline, I would get abruptly surprised, turning my cynical smirk into giggles and even on occasion guffaws.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The suspense keeps you reading, not knowing what,s next. The author has a great sense of imagination. Really enjoyed it.
B007N3GZ9C|5.0|The author is totally amazing, and I have heard her speak in front of doctors and the public about her dramatic experience. She found herself without left brain function after a stroke, yet was self--aware and lived a right-brain life, while she slowly FULLy recovered over seven years. The book glows with a subtle spirituality simultaneous with the observations of a brilliant scientist. Highly recommended
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twists, edgy, non stop reading! Every chapter was more exciting than the previous! I hated and loved throughout the whole book!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  You really get to know the characters.  I could not wait until the movie came out, but then was VERY dissappointed that they left out so much.  Books are always better!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This may be one of the best books I've ever read.<br />I can't believe I understood (well actually I can) and I'm not even a teen!!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that's up for a bloody adventure.<br />GO KATNESS AND PEETA!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a really nice romance book with some suspence as well.  I can not wait for the movie to come out!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My second brain! A great way to organize and archive your thoughts, notes and the various bits of daily jetsam that would otherwise clutter your life.
0399157565|3.0|I think this book is a little better than her past sevral books.  Still a bit to wordie/boring with  long run on conversations.  I still found myself skipping and skimming though not as much as in the past. Her first approx 10 Scarpeta books were the greatest. I have all her books except this one and Red Mist.  These two I got from the library as I got to where I refused to purchase any more of hers but kept hoping.  I will still get the next one from the library.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|A must read for all introverts. Ms Cain has given me a great insight on how I can improve my performance in my work without having to surrender myself in acting like an extrovert.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down. Colorful language, interesting plot, couldn't have asked for a better read. Well done Green, well done.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|I love this game. It took me a day or so to get the hang of it but when I did....I can't stop playing it. I use to play Mahjong all the time but that game has taken a back seat to this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is wonderful!  Shows very large on my iPad and easy to see and operate.  I'm thrilled I purchased this.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Held my interest.  Espionage and mystery without a lot of romance.  Boyd's writing has an easy flow to it making for a very enjoyable read.  The story was not predictable and there is a little history thrown in which I always enjoy.  I would recommend it.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Excellent and moving description of a philosophical perspective on life.  Really useful guide/manual at how to endure hardships and guide your life.  It's an excellent book, very easy to read and packed with wisdom.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. A story of a simple farmer with a horrific childhood in an irish orphanage. As he struggles to adjust to the death of his uncle, he ventures on a remarkable journey to discover himself.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought the book with some trepidation after reading some negative reviews.  The negative reviewers could not have been  more wrong!  The book is well written and and held my attention throughout.  Kyle and DeFelice not only provide a thorough description of the training and operations of a SEAL team but relate the pressures and complexity involved in the freeing of Iraq.
B0018OFN2W|5.0|i hate that vin wasn't in the movie, but it's still an amazing movie. it's worth more than 5 stars!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Got this on the discount day. It's a great app and does what it says. Very colorful. Didn't have any problems with install or running the app. It's smooth and a great way to stream music.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|I love this movie. Paul and Vin are amazing and I love the characters. This is BY far one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Had to have this app at the great reduced price. It's a good app for viewing documents and PDFs. I used it regularly to try it. I have been stuck on another office app so I  more familiar with it. But I use this from time to time just to have something different. It is powerful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much! It even better then temple run one. I especially love the rio version because it is very colorful and difficult. Get this app if you want a great and fun pass time. No problems what so ever!!!
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Cool app. I like it. The graphics are very detailed and there are lots of options within the app. Can look to moon phases in the future or past. It's very interesting.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This season of BB, like the three seasons before did not disappoint. What a great bad guy! What a WOW! finale! How would they top that in season 5? They didn't. Major disappointment. Season 5 tarnished the ENTIRE series for me. :[
B00A6I87UQ|5.0|I've been using the paper version of this book for several years and it is my favorite reference for casual observing. This is an outstanding map book for binoculars and for small to medium telescopes. It hits the sweet spot between basic maps that are too simple and don't provide enough detail to enable new users to identify objects unambiguously and the advanced maps that overwhelm with detail.  It has the Messier, Caldwell and NGC objects plus binary stars and other objects.  It is well laid out and has numerous indices to help locate objects.  New hobbyists will find it more than adequate. By the time this becomes insufficient, I need to refer either to software or to much larger, bulkier and inconvenient books of maps.  I can't recommend it highly enough. I own the paper version and got the Kindle edition for those times when I don't want to pack a paper book around.<br /><br />HOWEVER, be award that the Kindle version will NOT download to a PC running the Kindle software. It will run on iPads having the Kindle reader app.  I have confirmed this PC problem with customer support. If you plan on going to the field with a PC and accessing this as a secondary reference, it will not work. Addditionally, the kindle version is awkward to use if you need to flip back and forth between indices and maps or between map pages.  I was torn on rating it.  The book itself is a solid 5-star book.  The Kindle edition should be rated lower because of it's incompatibility with the Kindle for PC app.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Well directed and acted! I look forward to the next episode even though the seasons seem to be cut more and more every year.
034580404X|3.0|Good books but it wasn't until the last book that I everything came together more of a story line.  Enjoyable
B005R32L66|4.0|I was suprised how well this works on my somewhat old Tablet Android 10.1. I have it by me all the time you can go to a coffee shop and skype with your other half.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Propelled into the world of a wealthy entitled family of the early twentieth century living in England...you<br />Find yourself relating to not only their romances and inter-family rivalry but also to the incredibly interesting<br />Lives of their house maids and servants.  World War 1 only increases the interest as you see first hand<br />The impact war had on the lives of this family!  Very well done , believable, and enjoyable.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Well directed and acted! I look forward to the next episode even though the seasons seem to be cut more and more every year.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I consider this to be one of the best American novels of the 20th century.  The introduction by Thompson added new depth to my enjoyment of this  great story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|man I love this game so much this game is awesome it is BEAST it could not be any better
B009UX2YAC|5.0|purchased it for my son. He loves it, so far plays it all the time, my daughter started playing it too and she likes it as well. my kids ages are 11 and 8
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is one game that all of my kids enjoy playing and I do as well.  My seven year old doesn't get quite as far as my fifteen year old, but both find it challenging and entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me reading more I couldn't put it down. Loved it. Definitely a great read. Never expected the ending as I started the book.
1419705849|5.0|My kids read through these in a few hours, they can't put them down and laugh out loud reading them.  I love the movies.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I was turned onto `Porco Rosso' by some cinephille friends who raved it as one of the best animated works of all time.  It is Miyazaki, and I know that he is feverishly respected and lauded and what I've seen of his I've really connected to, but I don't often get around to this breed of anime so `Porco Rosso' wasn't high on my priority list.  Last night I finally decided to give it a go, and I must say I was surprised and yet wholly rewarded for my efforts.<br /><br />I expected something darker, maybe more straightforward and impactful and yet what I got packed a serious punch thanks to its restraint and subtle use of influence.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a pig named Porco who was once an Italian fighter pilot during WW1.  He was transformed into a pig after the war and is now living as a freelance bounty hunter in France since the secret police are searching for him in Italy.  When a confrontation with an American leads him in need of repairs, Porco travels back to Italy and receives help from a young female mechanic looking for her big break and soon Porco is finding his pig like interior being worn down.  Living with a heavy weight on his shoulders (watching his comrades die in the war obviously hardened him), Porco lives a rather introverted and somewhat heartless life, despite being drawn to the affections of a beautiful hotel owner and lounge singer.  Over the course of his adventure though, we see him soften.<br /><br />The plot is simpler and less `preachy' than I expected.  There really isn't any obvious message and yet the film says so much with those small moments as we see the shifts in Porco's demeanor.  This fantasy adventure is a beautiful watch, a film that moves organically and will touch your heart and feed your need for action (the action scenes are marvelous) and adventure.
B001EC2ISA|2.0|Weird and dumb. Hated Michael Keaton in this role. ugh.<br />I would not rent this or recommend it.  The End
6304383827|1.0|Emma,  the vhs fell apart during the first playback.I was not very happy when this happened.This took place within the first 5 minutes of play.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I need something to help me sleep most nights. This is good for variety of sounds and will be great for travel. Plus it doesn't seem to use/drain too much battery power.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|While this book was very enjoyable at times, I think the author was trying at times to do too much creating the circus world. Some parts were very clear and you can imagine them and other aspects were somewhat superficially described. It made for a dry read at times until the main characters discovered they were opponents. At that point it picked up but there were still a lot of unanswered questions.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|I WAS PLEASENTLY SURPRISED, JENNIFER LAWRENCE WONDERFUL ,AND STORY CONTENT IS APPROACHED IN A CONVINCING MANNER. THESE MOVIES THAT ARE INDIE&#34;S DON'T ALWAYS MAKE IT TO A BROAD AUDDANCE
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Item came quickly and was clearly new.  Gave as a gift for my nephews who enjoy it as much as I did when I was their age.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a must if you were a fan of the book and series. Can't wait to get the second season we pre-ordered and should go out the end of Feb.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie as expected was another awesome action packed thrill ride from liam neeson. The only movie that is better js taken 2.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Though there are some typos, and I wondered if all the math was correct (I didn't check myself), it was a very good book. The story is excitingly land writing is easy
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What can I say about Kiera and Matthew!  Oscar worthy performances.  The cast was perfectly cast.  The two younger sisters got on my nerves with their giggling and they were no match in beauty or acting chops for the rest of the cast but all in all, this is my alll time favorite movie!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Had no trouble with installation and it works every time I turn it on. I like the layout and ease of use on the Kindle Fire.
0307352153|5.0|Quiet is an outstanding book that explores the culture of extroversion that defines our country and the hidden power within introverts.  This book was fascinating and provided a tremendous degree of insight regarding introverts and extroverts. One cannot help recognize situations which Cain describes from his/her own life experience and no doubt see them a bit differently after gaining greater understanding from her work.  Introvert or extrovert...This one is worth reading!<br /><br />While this complimentary book was provided for review by Random House, Inc., no other compensation was given.  All remarks are my personal and honest opinions.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun to play and keeps you coming back to play. It's cool for a horse lover of any age.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Good and courteus service, great product, great company and nice people to do business with, Sure would buy again if needed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|engaging but not too stressful. nice visuals and music. a good game for grownups perhaps. good for strengthening spatial relations skills.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I love it, it shipped quickly and it was what was promised. Bought it on Saturday got it on Wednesday.
B0026PA05M|5.0|This disc is full of good songs.  Lizzy is a great singer!  I have bought all of Halestorm's albums and this one does not disappoint.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its amazing!! its WAAAYYY better than temple run and its way cooler! my friend showed it to me and k couldn't get it on my phone and I was just DYING to play! thank goodness for kindles!!!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Page turning excellent read!  What we've come to expect from Vince Flynn/ Mitch Rapp. I definitely recommend to anyone familiar with the series.
B005ZOCF5E|1.0|As the title says, why would the Kindle edition be priced higher that the Mass Market edition? The electronic has to be cheaper or at least at par.<br /><br />The book itself is fine - typical Alistair Reynolds, starts off slow and the last few chapters run at a breakneck pace.
B001GF5KDK|4.0|But I can't. Anyway Tortured Existence is the debut album from the East Coast's most insane and brutal band ever, Demolition Hammer. This and their sophomore album are the most intense albums to come out of North America in the early 1990s. We start off with the famous .44 Caliber Brain Surgery. It is about a guy who hates germs, blows his brains out, survives, but erases the part of his brain that causes his phobia of the \\"microscopic agents.\\" Neanderthal tells the story about the Ice Age character who in turns gets killed by Cro Magnon. It is pretty cheesy track but by just listening to the guitar and drums you wouldn't know it. The third track is one of their bests, Gelid Remains, Steve Reynolds spits venom at the listener on this track, absolutely brutal. I like the gang vocal shouts as well, very east coast of them. Crippling Velocity is one of the heaviest tracks on here, and as the last track has gang vocal shouts. The solo here is really impressive. Infectious Hospital Waste, has a killer intro riff. Vinny Daze is always spot on with his drumming. This track is really apocalyptic with a global plague brought on because sea creaturs devour the blood from a hospital which in turn causes a lethal virus that spreads among men almost causing extinction? I have no clue on earth how they came up with this, but the track is killer. Hydrophobia, right from the start it sounds like Steve Reynold's has rabies himself. This song is off the hook with intensity and brutality. Seventh, is Paricidal Epitaph. It feels like it being hit with a wrecking ball. This is a sweet song and one of my personal favorites off the whole album. Mercenary Aggression is fast! No better way to decribe it other than fast and intense. Cataclysm follows the same formula as most of the songs. Killer drums, deadly vocals, and heavy guitar riffs and solos. Overall, I recomend this album after Epedemic Of Violence. Its a great album, just not their greatest or most brutal.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|5++ out of 5 Stars (I loved this book!)<br /><br />Okay, where do I start???  My review is not going to do justice as to how special and wonderful this book is.  I have not read a book in a long time that has made me think and cry as much as `Me Before You.'<br /><br />This book is pricey, but I am telling you it is worth it!! Buy it! Read it!<br /><br />I have already re-read certain parts of the book and have felt the same intense emotions as I did the first time.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away because this is a book that I want the reader to experience. Some parts will be hard to read, but you will want to keep reading.<br />You will meet and get to know not only the main characters but their families and their relationship with each other. I felt connected to Lou and Will immediately.<br /><br />So much I want to say, but I cannot.  Not knowing what to expect or how it was all going to end, made it all the more special.  So I am leaving you with the same.  However, I will tell you this...you will laugh, you will cry and you will think.<br /><br />Did I skim? No<br />Did I feel connected to the characters? Yes.<br />Do I recommend? Yes<br />Would I reread? Yes<br />Ending: It was wonderful and everything else all in one.  I do not want to give anything away, but the last 10% of the book was 10+ stars.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I bought into the reviews about it having a good ending. It was typical John Grisham, not much different than his other books. Still enjoyed it.
0307887898|5.0|I bought this book for a required college course and it is just as I needed. Came in good condition.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Star Trek really blasted off in the season 2 , with the exploring new ideas , like a Star Fleet , Federation etc. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this set , but with the new enchanted F/X , it really looks alot better. After years in the 70's watching it on regular tv with shadows an static , We get to watch the show as it should be seen . If any episode is worth watching is &#34;THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE &#34; , before the alien craft looked like an ice cream cone , but now its more menacing an the Starship &#34;the Constellation &#34; is all pitted an when you see a close-up you can now see meteors bouncing off its hull .The only set back is the big plastic case it comes with, my hinge was broke when I bought it , but the discs dont have a label on  themso You dont know what disc it is unless You have good eyes to read the little print around the hole in the center of the disc. They also put these small cards that list whats on each disc . Paramount really did a cheap way of presenting this DVD set, but the enchantment is wonderful on how they remastered this series , its very clear , the colors are neat, an they do add to what You never saw in the old set The planets are so crisp , You see mountains on the surface . Its worth every red cent. I bought this set back in 2004 and just saw Oct. 2016 price of $ 30 is fantastic since I paid $ 50 back then .

B004SDSSFY|1.0|Can't get it to work.  Inadequate instructions are given for install.  Process is way too involved.  I am pretty good with computers and cell phone but this one stmps me.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|A new way of looking at information that provides insight to successful individuals.  It is a great guide for parents to read as they raise their children.  Sometimes small changes make a huge difference.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|What is better than Temple Run? Temple Run 2 of course! This game was meant to have a second game and this is it. Now I must end my review because my kindle is on low battery. Ha ha ha ha. Thank you creator for this game! I went so far-1560789 or something like that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game , me and all my friends like to try and best one and other ... Thank you
0765325950|4.0|This was a great read, took me back 15-20 years to the early books. It could have been as great as book 1 or 2, but instead it fell to about 4 or maybe 5.<br /><br />They try to touch on or reference seemingly every last character or piece of WoT lore from all 13 books. There's a reason behind it, but honestly it plays out a lot like watching a chess grandmaster laboriously surround a 5 year old's king with a board full of pieces before screaming check mate and trying to make the child cry.<br /><br />The characters get so little individual time they retain almost none of themselves, e.g.: part of the story hinges on Perrin's devotion to Faile and hers to him. I know this because the story says so in so many words, not because of their actions or words.<br /><br />And the trot-outs keep coming. There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and Sanderson rides cavalry charges over that line.<br /><br />You don't have to read in far before we are promised the last battle - tomorrow! That doesn't happen so much because there are so many back-references, cities, people and back-references to trot out.<br /><br />But finally, it starts. And if this was Mongoliad, it would be truly epic. But if you're expecting Lews Therin and the hundred companions, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Worse still, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and Sanderson rides cavalry charges over that line. Literally.<br /><br />In the end, I started skipping pages. I wanted one last insight into where this journey had taken Nynaeve, Gareth Bryne, Min, Matt, Rand... Not page after page of how infantry formations work.<br /><br />This book was to ending wheel of time what StarWars Episode 6 would have been if Lucas had decided that luke had tipped the emperor down the shaft by tying his shoe-laces together, rather than the battle-of-lightning he actually went with.<br /><br />Jordan wielded the One Power in a way that made you wonder. Perhaps because he's got so many back-refs to do, Sanderson wields it like a character in a bad video game: lightning bolt, lightning bolt, heal!<br /><br />These are some big flaws, but the climax pays a lot of it off, pays for many of the bad parts of the entire series.<br /><br />If you're invested in WoT, you have to read this book.to do, Sanderson wields it like a character in a bad video game: lightning bolt, lightning bolt, heal!<br /><br />These are some big flaws, but the climax pays a lot of it off, pays for many of the bad parts of the entire series.<br /><br />If you're invested in WoT, you have to read this book.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Having read the majoity of  Lee Child's books (especialy Reacher novels) I can say this was one of the best so far.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Once you get past the handful of unfortunate editing errors, this is good, old-school sci fi. I can see Ray Bradbury reading this in the tub or Arthur C Clark zipping thru the pages stopping occasionally to take notes.<br /><br />Is it a landmark new classic on the landscape of modern literature? Will it challenge you on pressing issues of modern society and religious freedom? No to both: it's just bloody good sci-fi, and you'll love every last page of it.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The novel is not as enjoyable as the movie. So, go see the movie and forget about reading the book.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I previously owned an Apple bumper which tore apart within a year after costing me a small fortune. This product does the job of protecting my phone, isn't too bulky, and is very reasonably priced.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|There are no english sub-titles.  My husband is hard of hearing makes it hard for him to enjoy it.  I ordered all<br />the season's.  I'll be able to enjoy them but he want.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive and amazing. It has made me change how often I am on my kindle fire making me play this game a lot more.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This is a fantastic family movie and the price was exceptionally low.  I am so glad I purchased it for my library, it is one that will be watched over and over by all.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|I swear this slick, cool, engrossing modern film noir is the best American film of the '90s. Only TOMBSTONE comes close.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As a dude I don't usually go for soap opera type shows but Downton Abbey is something different. It tells a story from multiple characters perspectives and makes it easy to sympathize with or hate certain characters with more of a drama feel. You just gotta watch it to know what I mean.  Bring on season 4.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|its a fun and interactive game ....I like how its a real handheld game. the only thing is I wish it was more touch screen like flicking the finger to make it jump
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Please fix bugs always freezing I'm always losing coins and awards once this is fix would be happy to give it 5 stars it is a really fun game
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies we've seen in a long time.  This movie is great for parents and kids.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is every bit as captivating as 1&2. The three story lines, main family, servants and jail are balanced with a clever interplay that moves the story forward leaving the viewer wanting more. It is very interesting to see how all the characters adjust to changing times.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Couldn't put this &#34;book&#34; down. I had watched a couple of the Dexter tv shows and thought the book series has to be fantastic......and the first one is!!! Can't wait to start the second book!!
B000UD08HW|5.0|Watching Gilmour play his songs and Pink Floyd's will always be a pleasure and this disc helps maximise the pleasure. The song selection, the sound and video quality is incomparable. Great purchase!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. The ending was definitely one I didn't see coming. I am now going to start the second John Puller book :)
B004ZNB12O|4.0|I am a big Pink Floyd fan and, having the entire set of albums, the decision to buy a compilation is based on the beauty of the design, which is in case is almost non-existent. The song selection is just fine for a person who is not familiar with PF, but basic information which might help contextualise the music and the artists is absent.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|So, I am a lifelong Superman fan, he is my favorite Superhero and in MY opinion, no one will ever play Superman/Clark Kent better than Christopher Reeve did. When I saw that they had released the &#34;Richard Donner Cut&#34; of Superman II on DVD, I thought I would see what possible difference it could make. My feeling about Superman II, having only ever seen the theatrical release which was directed by a fill-in director after Richard Donner (who IS a major diva and can be quite abrasive, sort of like Ridley Scott) was fired as director before filming could be completed on Superman II (both films were shot SIMULTANEOUSLY, NOT back to back). Therefore, when they brought in a different director, Superman II became a different film from the one it was originally intended to be, was that the theatrical release of Superman II was a bit hollow and was missing something and seem to lack much of the feeling of the first Superman film. Well, the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II, in my opinion, fills in those missing parts and returns much of the feeling I had from the first film. I won't go into detail how the scene changes and additions were made, since you need to see them for yourself, but I will say that the return of the footage shot of scenes between Superman/Kal-El (Reeves) and his father Jor-El (Brando) are amazing, and make ALL the difference in the world and almost brought me to tears. We actually get to see Jor-El TOUCH his son, which is emotionally powerful. The producers of Superman II originally left the Brando scenes out because they didn't want to have to pay Brando even more money for their use. THAT was their BIGGEST mistake in that version! As for the rest of the changes, some are subtle, such as alternate camera shots and others are more obvious, such as the opening scenes, which instead of a full recap of the original film, starts back on Krypton and then only shows those scenes necessary to the continuation of the story. The first scene of Lois Lane's testing of whether Clark IS Superman is also improved by moving the scene from Niagara Falls to the Daily Planet where the gag is MUCH more clever and the results are MUCH more amusing (Lois lands safely but messily on a fruit cart after bouncing off a sun canopy, seemingly saved by &#34;luck&#34; rather than by Clark/Superman). The ending scene eliminates the memory wiping &#34;Super Kiss&#34; of the original, which I never minded, but instead we see a similar time reversing ending to Superman II as we saw in Superman:The Movie. The scene change isn't all that significant, but the final exchange of words between Lois and Clark are more satisfying when as Clark walks away to go fetch Lois' pizza, Lois says, &#34;Clark sure is SUPER&#34; which Clark overhears as he glances at the camera with a wry look in his eye and gives a sigh! The Richard Donner Cut makes Superman II a better movie, period. No, Superman II will never quite reach the near perfection of Superman:The Movie, but with Richard Donner's cut, it comes as close as can be and we get to see the film as the original director of the first two Superman films INTENDED it. Another nice feature of this DVD is a short documentary about the process and decisions involved in recreating the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II from hundreds of reels of 30 year old film and interviews with Richard Donner and his collaborators. Five Stars and my full recommendation!!!

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|RHR:<br />First let me tell you I am a huge Eric Burdon fan.  In 64 when the British invasion came is when I really started to enjoy music. The Animals back then were one of my top favorite groups.  They had a unique style and I loved the bass riffs.  Eric Burdon’s  performance of “paint it black”  at the Monterey Pop Festival was simply spectacular and showed a future glimpse of what he was capable of beyond the Animals. After the Animals Eric Burdon evolved into different sounds.  His hard driving voice sets him apart from the usual suspects.<br />  Many years ago I was in a record store and I spotted a cd called “ My secret life” .  It said it was the first studio recording of EB in the last 8 or 10 years, I forget which.. There were songs on it I never heard of .  I liked Eric Burdon’s singing  so much that I bought it.  The first time I listen to the cd it sounded fairly good, the second time it grew on me, the 3rd time I decided it was the best cd I heard IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.  I have been hooked ever since.<br />  Once again EB has put out a great cd.  This is blue rock at it’s best . Others have reviewed their opinions of each song so I won’t go into that except the following.  Many of the songs are about his experiences, what has influenced him and his opinions.  Of special note are 2 songs.  Memorial Day, Which if memory serves me right I heard him perform at BB kings.  The other is “Bo Diddley Special “  This is a new/refined song based on his previous recording of Bo Diddley back in the early 60’s.  However it is so good and current it could be a top 10 song now and should be played in all the dance clubs.  A video should be made of this song.<br /> One final note, Eric Burdon has been performing at medium to smaller venues for years.  His performances are fantastic.  He does the popular Animal songs but also blends in so many other songs .  Once you hear him live you can’t get enough, can’t get enough, just can’t get enough.<br />  Other suggested cd's --Athen's Live--this is a must have

Thank you Ian Rankin for all the Rebus books (some I've read twice or more) and this one - a smooth reentry into Edinburgh with old friends.  Hoping for more in the future.

B0013527I4|5.0|Who wouldn't love this?  Great gift.<br /><br />It is so silly to require a certain amount of words for these comments, isn't it?
1401232590|5.0|If two face is one of your favorite Batman villains then youll love the long halloween. This graphic novel sums up everything you want to know about Harvey Dent and his divided thoughts of whats good and whats evil.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|A very good story.  The characters that Patrick Rothfuss creates are very likable and easy to connect with, and the story sucks you in from beginning to end.<br /><br />This novel, like the first one, is written in the first person.  I found this a little wierd at first but I got used to it I kind of like it.  However, I found it a little more difficult to get back into the normal story telling of other authors.<br /><br />The only really negative thing I have to say, and this is the reason I only gave it three stars, is that Kvothe, the main character, is too perfect.  I read this in an Amazon review of the first book and it really stuck with.  His only real flaw is that he can't keep his mouth closed.  He masters nearly everything he attempts with relative ease, ex. his sympathy is near perfect, his lute playing is perfect, women chase after him, he meets, conquers, and leaves Felurian with his wits intact.  The only really negative thing to happen was in the first book when his parents die and the little things after that are just that, little and almost meaningless.<br /><br />So if you can get past that I do think it was a good read and I know I did enjoy it.

B005C7SXMS|5.0|Real, Real great. Has all those special features showing how Richard went about the process of making his first feature film.
B000P6PVLC|2.0|This could have been a great film, but I can't recommend the final product.  The screen play was bad, or maybe it's the editing.  The whole package does not come together.<br /><br />I did like some of the outstanding camera shots, you can skip forward to find the good ones.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I read this book in the course of a couple of hours over two days. It was a very good read, especially after reading a little about Vonnegut's past. One could empathize with the character and narrator with ease, despite a relatively strange Sci-Fi webbing that wove the story together. This book makes me curious to read another of Mr. Vonnegut's works.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|I've wanted the extended version since I saw it on tv years ago. The price was right so I ordered it. I love it.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Wall -E was ok because it was in blu ray and everyone should watch and own it if they have children
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|I love this watch. Great look to it and it gets lots of compliments. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars, is the strap looks cheap and kind of brings down the whole look of the watch. It’s an easy fix though. Just buy a new strap.
B001GKJ2DE|5.0|Wanted is a great movie because it was in blu ray and everyone should watch and own it but is bloody.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was the book everyone talked about for months! I finally read and I was instantly reeled in. I felt like I was part of the plot and the knew the characters. But then after the big climatic drama, it kind of tapered off and it felt like Gillian Flynn got lazy and just wanted her book to end.<br /><br />I absolutely HATED the ending and still think it was a bit of a lazy, cop-out move.<br /><br />A good thriller book, but I was kind of disappointed in the end.
B000HA4WTS|5.0|Fast and the Furious:  Tokyo drift is a great movie because it was in blu ray and everyone should watch and own it.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Fun all the way through, it didn't nosedive at the end like some kids movies do...Kids and adults laughed the whole time.  This is a keeper!  We highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you enjoyed the last temple run game, you'll love this one.  same concept but better scenery, a variety of different obstacles, and new gameplay to keep you playing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. It's so entertaining. If I could, I'd marry this game. That is how much I love it. Thanks for reading this review.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|The voice of Marius could have been stronger however<br />the 25th was excellent as the 10th.  Each had their good parts
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book to be a little slow going when he started the medical jargon, but I thought his paradigms (explaining complex concepts through a simpler description) were very helpful.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B0049J5EWW|5.0|This movie is a classic and a masterpiece. This is a movie i could watch over and over and over.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great to pass the time and is a cool new twist on an old classic. I could play this game for hours.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Amazing. Perfect for my child. Comes in handy when we don't have a real dictionary on hand. We love it.

B005LAIISA|5.0|This dvd has been checked out several times and everyone who checked it out really lilked the little characters..Good reviews.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Book 2 in the trilogy starts out with a new line (story) but almost ends too quickly.  Sure enough, Book 3 picks up exactly where 2 left off.  Overall, this trilogy is well written and kept me interested to where I did not want to put it down.
0544045203|4.0|This was hard for people to read but three people really liked it and two didn't.Will not order again.Too hard to follow.
B000EGCITG|4.0|The album is great, but...<br />Oddly my album was marked Explicit, yet the music itself is censored. Luckily the MP3 downloads are the true explicit versions.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this trilogy. These are books that I will read again on my Kindle Fire.<br />Great for the price
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Not great literature, but very entertaining.  Make up your own mind about this trilogy.  Read it because you want to.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|every time I click on temple run 2 it loads but then takes me back to my home page.. if you have a list of things to fix this one should be number one on the list. also when I did get to play the glitches bugged me a lot that is number 2 hopefully on your list.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Don't let the 1 star reviews deter you.  This book is entertaining, adult themed reading.  Don't go into this expecting Pulitzer Prize winner.  Just enjoy it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This saga was a good read.  The individual stories flowed together naturally, and I hope that there are more installments.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This wasn't too bad.  Not sure I understand all the hair fisting, it seemed to happen all the time through the book.  I did want to find out what happened to these two characters.  The subject matter is definately not for everyone. Overall not a bad read.  I will finish the trilogy
6305558175|4.0|Great movie.  Great service by vendor.  It arrived sooner than expected and in great shape.  A pleasure doing business with the vendor.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Although I just started using this workout video, I loved it. I find it easy enough to do everyday, but challenging enough to feel I am getting a good work out in. The work out went by quick, I paired it with a mile run and boy my legs were sore the next day. Really reccommend this to anyone who is beginning their journey to getting in shape.
B000H30B2C|4.0|I could barely believe the price for this three disc CD set.  Many people pay more for a single DVD.  It's far and away the best movie in its genre ever made.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy has done it again. This is a very good storyline that Clancy has created. The ending was a bit anti-climatic, but overall a very good book. Lots of action and good characters to follow. Hope to see more in this storyline.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds Seasons Free  by Rovio Entertainment Ltd. is a good birds game. It has a few different views than I've seen before.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire by MobilityWare is a good card game with better, smoother movements than others. It is a relaxing game after a long day.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I have always wanted to learn how to play the piano.  Will probably get the rest of the aps when I master this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a blast and addicting. Good for people of all ages to play. Highly recommend to anyone to purchase and play.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's was very interesting book. Make you want to continue reading, because you want to know what happen next. Looking forward to next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it! Sad it has to end. Very exciting and thrilling. Good book to read. Scholastic level z. Good book overall
B000JLPMPS|5.0|What can one say about a masterpiece?  Certainly too much for an amazon review.  If you love cinema, own this movie!  I watch it every year or so, and it gets better every single time.<br /><br />It's an incredible critique on a culture which often glamorizes gunslingers, gunfights, violence, shootouts, etc... this movie shows it for what it is.  It shows you there is more to a story than the superficial layer of mythology often passed down as truth, and there are more to the people involved in these myths.  It murks the difference between who's good and who's bad, leaving the audience to actually think for themselves, calculating the humanity in each and every character.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Her same sexy smooth voice. Beautiful music. I would recommend anything she does to people. Enjoyed it very much and look forward to her next album.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Downloaded to see if it would be usefull drowning out other background noise so I could sleep. It was ver successful. There are lots of sound options to select from and most are really relaxing. It's worth getting. I like to sleep in complete silence normally but. When that's not an option, this app is perfect for drowning out other noises, like neighborhood construction during the early evening.
B0063IH60K|3.0|To many pop up ads ,,, get rid of them .. I like the game  just not th ads,,,,,,,,  ahhhhhhhhhhhh
B003K07DUC|1.0|What a disappointment! I was really hoping for something better than this from Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass. Twenty minutes into the movie, it was clear what the real motive for the movie was to make a political statement.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, filled with action, humor, and heartfeld emotion, not to mention great actors.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Purchased this set for my granddaughter's birthday.  She's a big Star Wars fan, especially this original trilogy. I haven't heard any complaints as to the quality of these DVD's.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I love this movie, as it combines a fantasy element with a powerful romance, and the actors are two of my favorites.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Much better than the first in my opinion, better graphics and more interesting to keep you playing! Definitely looking forward to any updates or future games from them.
B00447L4KA|5.0|Not only for teens, this movie appeals to all ages with its broad humor and scenarios that could fit any family.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Don't get this app it doesen't work very good and you can't sign in and use your own account. DUMB
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly Clarkson has one of the strongest voices to come along in a long time, and her songs are great to listen to.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Greatest Hits is exactly right. Every song was and is still a hit. I had almost forgotten about some of her older tunes so have been playing it over and over! Wish I could get it in my Cloud Player though.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I love this movie regardless of others opinion great fun movie and yes Tom cruise really sings. He is a perfectionist lol
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved, loved, loved it! Couldn't wait till the next episodes and am so glad there will be a season 4 and 5 to look forward to!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love it but wish they would have a few free games in t heir entirety or do sequels for it and make those free.
B001974DG0|5.0|One of Koontz's best.  Damaged hero, insane bad guys, love, and of course the dog!  I enjoyed every page !
0385342039|4.0|I enjoy Sophie Kinsella's novels and this was a pleasure to read--another one I was sad to finish. (This was a particularly fun read w/ KBRD am radio streaming in the background!) I only rated this one four stars since it seemed a little slow at the beginning and Sadie was more annoying than endearing. Also, the main character is much too obsessed with her ex and that story line got tiring. Still, a fun, quick read.  (I will note that I get annoyed by the overuse of 'token' words; this book was no exception: agog, rictus, etc. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for improving one's vocabulary, but when the words are noticeably used multiple times, it's a bit off-putting.)
B008V0OLOW|2.0|Compared to Diana's previous albums this is boring. No energy in the singing. Perhaps I just don't like this particular style.
B00ANW33CM|2.0|I'm torn between 2 or 3 stars for this one. I quickly made it through 5 levels, easily beating the clock, but loaded program on my Galaxy Note 10.1, the graphics should be awesome smooth - the frame rate was so slow it makes my state of the art bleeding edge android look cheap. 1+ star for low permissions and good try, 1+ star for it not crashing.
B000BNI90O|5.0|It is wonderful to have the complete music, not only in normal stereo, but also in surround (DVD-Audio, not SACD).
B005Y0OFVG|5.0|Georgette Heyer at her best: Fully developed characters that get into scrapes of their own making. The theme is an old one of course: the marriage of convenience that becomes a marriage of love. In this case that's mixed up with the problems people can get into when they don't really want a relationship, when taking responsibility is a new thing and there's a lot of growing up to do as well. Combine that with the challenges of trying to fit into 'polite society' and you have plenty of plot twists and surprises to enjoy, as a reader.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Almost as good as the first one. The stakes are definitely higher. This duo must come back together again for a 3rd adventure!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy this game because enjoyed temple run 1...... In this game the ppl cost more but there is more power up

B006WQLH7G|4.0|This is also one of the most feature rich clients and also is one of the top rated by testing labs at detecting malware.
0307474259|4.0|This book and its message have helped me, my wife, my sister and several friends collectively lose hundreds of pounds. The approach to eating it advocates is not hard to follow and does not feel like a diet. I have had to buy several copies because people keep &#34;borrowing&#34; it.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|I was intrigued to read this book.  However the first few chapters were absolutely painful to get through.  Just dead writing.  Nothing you really need to know or care to pay attention too.  But when miss winters starts telling her story the pace of the book defiantly picks up.  Once your 3/4 of the way through there are lots of twists and turns that keep you reading.  So if you can bare the extremely boring beginning it's a pleasant read after that.  Glad there were no loose ends to wonder about.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|If you have never seen this film before, then I would highly recommend watching it. Although it is a musical, it is not a serious droll. With big-time celebrities like Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, and Steve Martin, this is a smash-hit.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn is the best.  The values in his movies and the way he plays his characters are always fabulous. I never tire of watching it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Similar apocalyptic idea as divergent and hunger games, only just enough different to make me like it more.  Bravo Dashner, I even loved the ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best simple calculator app hands down.  Intuitive &amp; fast and free.  What else could you ask for.  Very clean interface and works perfect with Kindle Fire.  I can't say for new HD versions. but if you don't have this app get it now.
0321544080|4.0|Great guide on &#34;how to get the shot&#34; ,explained well & diagrames help a lot in explaineing the background behind getting the shot.<br />Would be a great help if were needing to get the shot under timeline pressure.<br /><br />Slightly disappointing in that UI thought I would have been more about artisitic composition.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I thought I'd be sitting through another boring musical movie, but i couldn't have been more wrong. Hilarious movie and I have to admit the songs were pretty awesome.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it works well and its always there were ever when ever I need it to be I lied it and I believe you will as well
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just started reading Wool, and so far I love it. It's a great read if you like apocalyptic stories. This series takes place much time after an Armageddon-like scenario, and deals more with the subsequent generations moving on and living their lives. There was only one thing I wish was a bit better; I wish there were better scenic descriptions. I understand that it was a story more focused on people and a purpose, but the scenery is such a big part of the story and plot, that I wish they were described a bit better. I still don't have a good grasp in my mind of the layout of the silos, besides the central stair and particular rooms on certain levels. However, it hasn't taken away from the story as my imagination was able to fill in the gaps, so 5 stars anyway!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!The new updates are really cool to.For some reason when I dug some water something big and brown killed me.:(

B001NHNG64|1.0|My first acquaintance with Jack Reacher was the movie which I very much enjoyed.  I ordered Lee Childs' first book and really liked it.  But, regardless of the great action, I'm in the middle of 'Die Trying' and cannot get past the fact that Mr. Childs apparently does not understand that Adolph Hitler did not lead the National Capitalists; they were the National Socialists.  It is those GIs who committed their lives to defend the individual freedoms of the Constitution that destroyed the Axis tyrants.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Lots of excitement for those with a strong heart. Normally I do not care to see a movie more than once. This is so good I am now on my 3rd viewing. It's great !
B00127RAJY|5.0|I felt this the next morning...but in a good way!! This is a great workout. I think the \\"old school\\" feel of it, with jumping jacks and jumping rope is great, and she is very motivational.  I've done a lot of workouts. Where this video hits the mark, is that it doesn't stop working for you.  You will be constantly working. Constantly feeling it!!!

B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a great story about overcoming adversity.  The only reason I down graded it to four stars was because of the large number of spelling and grammar issues.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|So glad to see Toca Boca somewhere  other than iTunes. My kids have all the games on their iPods and now they can use my kindle if they forget the iPod at home. Bonus that the kindle gives us all more room to play together. Please bring more apps to Amazon!!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I rarely dislike books, but Gone  Girl has made the list. The book starts off slow and didn't hold my interest. I'll admit it gets interesting through the middle as the story of this seemingly normal couple begins to unravel. My negative rating really comes in the last third of the book, where it just seems forced and a bit ridiculous.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The perfect blend of action and drama; I haven't enjoyed a show this much since \\"24\\". Can't wait for the season to continue.

0143039881|5.0|Eichmann in Jerusalem is on the surface an account of the 1960-62 trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. In reality, the book explores a number of issues relating to the Holocaust.<br /><br />The book was very badly received upon its release. The author was vilified and accused of everything and anything, from excusing Eichmann's crimes to being a self-hating Jewess and a Nazi apologist. Anyone who had read the book will tell you that these accusations are absurd.<br /><br />The reason for all this criticism comes from the fact that the author points out that Eichmann was never the monster he was portrayed to be, and also because she talks a lot about Jewish collaboration with the Nazis, which reopened a painful wound in collective Jewish memory.<br /><br />As the years went by, the passions surrounding the book cooled down. When Eichmann's trial was taking place, the memory of World War II was still very fresh. Jewish survivors of the Holocaust were everywhere and every middle aged adult had memories of the war. Slowly, slowly, the survivors aged and started to die out. The younger men and women who started to replace them had no personal experience of the war, and therefore they could approach this book with more detachment. Also, a lot of historical and psychological research has been done since the sixties, and most of the findings support the author's observations and conclusions.<br /><br />Still, even if today the book is not as relevant as it was when it came out, I would recommend it not only to the ones who are interested in World War II, but anyone who wants to research about genocide and atrocities in general. In fact, at the end of the book, the author warns precisely of that. As I was reading her words, I thought of later genocides such as Cambodia or Rwanda, and these are only two examples out of many.<br /><br />As I already said, the book is a look at the Holocaust through examination of Adolf Eichmann. Who was Adolf Eichmann? He was born in Austria in 1905 into a lower middle class family. Right from the early age, he was, at least in his own opinion, a failure. He dropped out of technical school where he was studying to become an engineer and never got any higher education, which was not good for his self-esteem. Through family connections, he got a job as (I kid you not) a travelling vacuum hoover salesman. By the time he reached his late 20s, he was deeply dissatisfied with his life and was looking for something else to do with himself. Fortunately for him and unfortunately for the rest of the world, the Nazis were on the rise as that time in Germany.<br /><br />Eichmann joined the SS, not out of any political beliefs, but because he saw them as an opportunity to finally achieve some success in life. He was not anti-Semitic in any way. He had distant Jewish relatives (whom he helped to escape to Switzerland much later) and even a Jewish mistress.<br /><br />In 1930s, he was put in charge of an office that \\"encouraged\\" and \\"helped\\" Jews emigrate out of Germany. Once the Final Solution was started, he was responsible for organizing some of the transports carrying Jews to extermination camps. He was also one of many emissaries sent to Nazi-allied countries to help them with their \\"Jewish question.\\"<br /><br />Early in the war, Eichmann had achieved the rank of a colonel in the SS, and he never (much to his chagrin) progressed beyond it.<br /><br />After the war, he stayed in hiding in Germany for few years, and then escaped to Argentina. There, he lived a very simple life of a manual laborer and factory worker. Although he was in contact with the Nazi \\"diaspora\\" in Argentina, he was never involved in their activities. Probably because he himself was not interested and partially because fellow Nazis thought him to be of no importance.<br /><br />Eichmann lived under a false identity, but he was careless and often let slip out, or even bragged, who he really was. In 1960, he was kidnapped by Israeli agentsand smuggled into Israel for a trial. He was found guilty and executed in 1962.<br /><br />That, in short, is the life and times of Adolf Eichmann. The author came under very intense criticism (that sometimes crossed over into insults and character assassination) because she had pointed out that Eichmann was not as big criminal as he was painted to be. For various reasons (some purely political), he was decried as the sole organizer of the Holocaust. There were even those who claimed in all seriousness that it was Eichmann who gave the idea to Hitler. (The two men had never met.)<br /><br />The thought that a mere colonel came up with the idea of the genocide program, convinced the Nazi leadership to adopt it, and then ran it almost all by himself is plainly absurd. Especially in light of testimonies and documents plainly proving otherwise. Yes, Eichmann was a senior officer in the SS, but he was not even close to Hitler's inner circle. His job was to carry out orders. He had some leeway in how to carry them, but he still had to carry them out.<br /><br />This in no way means that Eichmann was innocent. He wasn't, and the author makes clear that he wasn't. What made people angry was that the author points out that he was never as big a criminal as he was made to be. Think of it this way. When someone murders five people, and is accused of murdering hundreds, truth and fairness demand to point out that no, he had murdered five people instead of hundreds. Doing so in no way absolves him of the five people he did murder.<br /><br />But I believe that the biggest controversy originated with the author's psychological profile of Eichmann. The two never met (she attended his trial, but the two never spoke with each other), but she compiled his psychological profile based on her own observations, testimonies of people who knew him, painstaking research into his past, the narratives written by Eichmann himself, and the psychological evaluation that he underwent before the trial. What shocked the world (and her probably too) was the fact that Eichmann was perfectly normal.<br /><br />In the book, Eichmann comes out as an insecure individual who desperately wanted acceptance and recognition. He hoped to achieve it through loyal, efficient and enthusiastic service to his superiors. In other words, he wanted to please those above him.<br /><br />Eichmann also happened to suffer from selective memory and had a tendency to stretch the truth and to exaggerate. He was not deliberately lying (in fact, he was quite honest), but subconsciously building a better image of himself to make himself feel better about his own person. He was prone to bragging and self-aggrandizing caused, most likely, by his insecurity and neediness.<br /><br />Eichmann comes out as a flawed human being, but still a human being. We all have our faults and flaws. Eichmann comes out as no worse or better than any of us. Moreover, even more disturbing, Eichmann, his \\"job\\" aside, was a decent human being. From accounts we know that he was polite, even kind, to all those around him. He even treated Jews with respect. With the exception of his involvement in the Holocaust, he had never committed any serious crime, nor is there even the thinnest shred of evidence to suggest that he was a psychopath or mentally deranged in some other way.<br /><br />Was he a fervent Nazi then? No. Like any Party member, he had to pay lip service to Nazi ideology, but it seems that deep in his heart he did not believe in it. He was not anti-Semitic in the least and had no personal reasons to wish harm to Jews.<br /><br />Well then, why did he participate in mass murder? Not only he participated in it, he was not bothered by it very much.<br /><br />Eichmann's own explanation was that he was just following orders. That is the explanation offered by pretty much all war criminals. At the time of Eichmann's trial, no one accepted it, but later psychological research demonstrated amply that humans dogive in to orders coming from authority figures, and they are submissive towards peer pressure.<br /><br />Eichmann was told by all his superiors (whom he regarded as legitimate authority figures) that the Final Solution might be unpleasant, but is the morally right thing to do. When he looked at his peers and fellow Germans, everyone held essentially the same position. Who was Adolf Eichmann, insecure and desperate to please as he was, to say otherwise?<br /><br />The example of Denmark, which is described in the book, illustrates my point. The people of Denmark fiercely protected \\"their\\" Jews. Most of the time, the Germans backed away and left Danish Jews more or less in peace. On the few occasions when the occupying authorities were told by Berlin to take aggressive action against Jews, they came up with excuses not to do it or just plainly and flatly refused. This disobedience occurred even amongst the ranks of SS units stationed in Denmark.<br /><br />Why was it that the \\"Danish\\" SS refused to harm Jews while their SS \\"brothers\\" elsewhere were all too happy to forcibly put Jews on trains bound for Auschwitz or to shoot them on the spot?<br /><br />No doubt there were practical reasons, such as fear of provoking a rebellion, but a lot of those men were refusing to obey their orders for moral reasons. They were surrounded by a population who believed that the persecution of Jews was immoral, and some of that belief rubbed off on \\"Danish\\" Germans. In case someone wonders, Nazis managed to murder only few dozen Danish Jews out of a population of thousands.<br /><br />The reason why I am talking about it, as does the author, is that genocides are committed by individuals who are otherwise normal. A handful of exceptions aside, none of those mass murderers are insane or brainwashed. They murder because all those above them and all those around them tell them that what they do is permissible, even desirable.<br /><br />This does not absolve them. Murder is evil, evenwhen your bosses and coworkers tell you otherwise. But explaining away genocide by saying that those who commit it are evil monsters and that is the end of it will not prevent it in the future.

0062082353|4.0|When I first posted this review, there were roughly 3000 other reviews and many 1 and 2 star reviews. Most of the low rated reviews were from folks posting negative comments that had not even read the book. They were obviously against the war, didn't like the military, etc. Some of these comments are offensive, at least too me they were. I made a point to bring this to the attention of potential buyers of Chris's book so they wouldn't let the low ratings affect their decision to read, what I think is a very good story. I think this is important to point out and that's why I am including it here. The point here is to be helpful to others. So, with that said, I'd like to update this review a little bit now that over 5000 folks have had the opportunity to read it and leave their reviews, which seem to be a little more objective. I still disagree with others that claim this book is \\"poorly written\\". I think Chris, with help of course, did a pretty darn good job describing his experiences.  This book was written by a Navy SEAL. Not Tom Clancy. This book is written in what I would call a sort of \\"conversational style\\". In other words, he writes like he talks. He is telling you a story or collection of them. I found his honesty refreshing. He makes no bones about the fact that he loves his job. He wasnt the best father or husband at times. He doesnt like politics, etc. I liked his sense of humor (I caught myself laughing out loud at times). I especially liked his discussion on his gear and weapons. It's interesting to read about what sort of equipment someone needs to survive in that kind of environment. He put things in his book that he was constantly asked about. Thats why they are there. The book also has some decent maps and photographs. This is not a book for everyone. One reviewer said the book was too \\"technical\\" and he couldnt follow it. Another said it was written by someone in \\"grade school\\". You can see by those two comments how differently this book will be viewed. This is a story of a man that goes to war, as he was trained to do. He had to make life and death decisions almost everyday. It's easy to sit in a nice comfortable home, and second guess him but the bottom line is that I am quite sure the men that served next to him were glad he was there. So all I can say is if you are interested in the life of a Navy SEAL, grab it. If not, why would you condsider it in the first place? Chris Kyle, rest in peace and God bless the men and woman who serve, and have served, this country.wed. This is a story of a man that goes to war, as he was trained to do.

B00000IZOR|4.0|bought this for my nephew and god daughter, it brought back good childhood memories for me so i knew they would love it. the only draw back was the pull cord and receiver cord were too short. I had to tie an extra length of string so that he could enjoy it as a pull along. But all in all i love it!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|You sucked it did not make any sense of duty in video games and more people are stupid regular people
B005LAJ16I|1.0|I chose this rating because I was unable to view the programme as it could not be viewed in this area. Further, I had to pay customs duty of €14.00 because it was sent from USA.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Personally I liked this movie, it was packed with action and the special effects were spectacular.  The creatures were wonderful.  I understand this movie was supposed to be #1 of a trilogy, but Disney does not endorse the future episodes.  Unfortunately, I think they are missing the mark.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful story of learning how to grow; of change, of loosing and finding love, of acceptance, of changing one's attitudes and beliefs, of making new friends, of life and death, of growing old.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I watch movies to be entertained, as a result I seldom disect a production.  I really liked this movie; it was rich with action and I watched with anticipation as the Snow White fairy tale unfolded with a few different twists.  It held my attention throughout.  The special effects were excellent.  As a period clothing producer, I found the costumes wonderful.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I am running Windows 7 and this button would not  work!!  I was all set to send it back but decided to track down the manufacturer tech support.  It was worth it.  Altho this technology is not officially supported for Windows 7, it can and does work for most functions.  It was definitely worth the effort to call tech support at Griffin.  Great little device for a good price.
B001AFF25W|5.0|A very down to earth exercise in getting the most out of life and your time. I recommend it to folks who think they have all the time in the world to waste.
1451695195|1.0|The author may be a neurosurgeon but that doesn't stop this piece from being unscientific, delusional and just plain nonsense.
B003YOSXH6|1.0|This is a book of lists. You could save time and money by simply typing \\"grammar\\" into Google and taking the first 10 pages you find. Nothing new or helpful here. Same stuff you learned in third grade.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very enjoyable & easy to read!  I loved the book so much! I can't wait for the movie to come out
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really loved the whole book was written in the format of writing letters to somebody. Activities, feelings, and all the deep thoughts are expressed in each letter. It was so sentimental and took me back to when I was Charlie's age and a few years beyond, and thought all the good and bad memories of my old friends, teachers, school, families, and everything else. Things that made me really sad back then still stick on me sometimes but I am doing fine, old boyfriend and some crushes were the only people I thought I would love for the rest of my life, laughs my friends and I shared, etc. Just all those things, normal things, came back to me when I read this book and I even cried on some letters. This was the best book I have read so far in my life and I want to pass it on to my daughter when she is in high school or maybe in college.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book so much!! It shows how evil can take over your initial emotions, it shows love and compassion, and how we as humans, have the ability to love. It shows that friends can come in human and/or spiritual form, it shows that we have to trust our instincts and it shows how love is a big part of human life. There are many moral lessons but, Safe Haven is also realistic in many ways. This book shows how love can blind you, but also how it benefits you. The characters feel what normal people feel everyday, they battle the same battles, and overcome the same struggles. Katie/Erin is just an example of what, unfortunately, a lot of women these days go through. This is a great read and it really puts every day life into perspective.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I just loved this book to pieces. It keeps you interested all the way through and really makes you wonder
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book was amazing. I cried when I finished 2 hours after I bought it! I encourage everyone to read this heartfelt book. Best book ever. Such a great story and I'm going to read this again and again. I loved Charlie and him explaining his life. 5 stars!!!
B008J05EL8|1.0|Haven't used it yet to fully review.  I anticipate very positive results.  Mobile Systems produce very good software products that are reliable and work well.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Wonderful movie with fantastic music.  I had to have the sound track and listen over and over again.  One could see the scenes of the movie as the music played.  I will enjoy this for a really long time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Everything is good, the graphics, the action, the challenges...The only thing is that sometimes my tablet is not sensitive enough for my fingers to change the actions, or is it the program...?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is a great series -- the second season was as good as the first. I love watching it without distracting commercials. If you like weird and scary stuff, this is the show for you. I can't wait to see what they have in store for season 3.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Just not very good, couldn't understand the bad guy 1/2 the time, the story dragged, wanted more action... No reason this needed to be almost 3 hours!
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|This true story is a wonderful one....however using dialog and innuendo instead of detailed sex scenes could have accomplished a better result, leaving the audience to visualize Helen Hunt becoming naked while discussing the &#34;climax&#34; of the moment.  Using words would have been more powerful.  She has good acting skills that didn't need the shock value.  Too raw, attention was diverted from the theme; images too vivid.  I am not a prude and do believe there are times when nudity/love making are appropriate, this just wasn't it.
0062127241|5.0|While it may fall short in some areas, it reveals a lot in others. And since few people have lives interesting enough to warrant an autobiography, I wonder 'Who am I to critique this man?' Pete Townshend is an artist and a musical genius, so read it and appreciate the fact that we're here in his time.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|this movie is aca-freaking-amazing. I love fat amy because she is aca=freaking-amazing as well. Buy this movie right this minute.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|\\"The Misremembered Man\\" is alternately heartbreaking and sweetly funny.  It's a poignant study of the effects of childhood experiences - especially the terrible brutality of abuse - that linger into adulthood (\\"Perhaps, she mused, we never really stop being the children we once were\\"), and how we all have a deep-seated need for love and affection.  Do read it.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|this camera is one of the better ones that i've seen on the app store. The camera quality is not the best though.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This novel has kept me eager to read the next page since the beginning. Besides being a SK book, time travel is one of my favourite themes.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The first book leaves you hanging but this one is a little more like it! You will still want to read the third however!
0307887960|5.0|i love this diet! the book is a great guideline! i lost 10 pounds in my first week and still counting!!!! (: buy the book its worth it!
1592407889|1.0|This book was not something that was completely heartfelt.  First of all Sachi I do believe exaggerated the stories to make it juicy for publicity.  Shirley MacLaine cared deeply for her daughter and to say she never tried to help her career or to say 30 is over the hill to start her career is indeed crap.  People need to read Shirley's books and see that she told sachi many many times that she was smart, beautiful and very talented.  She would be a great actress she has a talent for it.  Shirley made her statement and her statement had more class and more intellect to it than sachi's entire book.  If you wanted to mend your relationship with your mom you do not write a book that is filled with lies.  You don't let an interviewer on tv make fun of your mom.  You &#34;protect her&#34;.  Obviously you don't care about your mom.  Or maybe you do and just don't know where to start.  Hmmm maybe not lying about her or saying she didn't really care.  You've been caught already in several lies, I just curious how many more.  How could you write a book filled with false statements and expect your mom to just say it's ok.  You hurt your mother deeply.   Shame on you!!!  NO I Do Not Work for Shirley.  Just in case people start posting that.  But no hate here Sachi.  But you should have told more truths instead of more lies.  I hope you and your mom truly sit down and talk about this.  Tell her your problems and concerns!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. My 2 boys really love this it !!! We downloaded  it to both i pods and the kindle.
B004YKB52O|4.0|bought it as a late xmas gift<br />my grandson loves this band's music and would like to collect other releases by this group
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|All I had to do was ask for a new cord and Kazaam! I received one.  Works great.  Thanks for quick response.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|When I hear &#34;documentary,&#34;  this type of movie doesn't come to mind.  This is an incredible story about a talented man with an intriguing life. The quest for Rodriguez is told in a captivating and entertaining way and discovering his music is an unexpected find.  Very well done!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i think it is entaining but takes a long time to level up and get gems and sometimes loads very slow.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|I enjoy this recording however, it's different from the movie.  I think the updated lyrics are better in the movie version compared to the original cast which is this recording.  However, if you enjoy the movie and wish to hear it in the car, this is your only option.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I set this up on a tablet for our grandkids.  They love this game and have had me playing it as well.  Fairly good graphics without any significant delays or lag.
0877180121|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who lives in another state.  Her mother tells me she is totally occupied with it.  When she discovered the microphone, she was totally blown away.  I also bought her a book and some stickers to put on the keys, so now she plays and her little sister sings.  Very happy with the piano.
1451683405|5.0|Great book.  It has some edition problems (fair cutting of the pages) but I can forgive it. I recieved it very fast
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this version because it gives reference scriptures as well as definition explanations.  I also like the NkJ version.
B000I8G5B2|5.0|this is such an amazing movie. love it! i think that it was ahead of it's time and people don't appreciate it or know about it like they should.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Never read something that made me grit my teeth so hard on anticipation. Excellent book I loved it so much
B001VIMCW4|3.0|This just fell short of my expectations. I loved Casino Royale and the latest one, Skyfall.. but just didn't like this film. However, I did like the reference to Goldfinger with respect to how someone was &#34;offed.&#34;
1938469011|5.0|Another great entry to the \\"Brewing Elements\\" series. Hieronymous has a very approachable writing style, interweaving the technical aspects of hop chemistry with personal stories about those who grow these magical little flowers.<br /><br />One of the biggest selling point of this book is the guide to hops, detailing over 100 different varieties and their different uses (bittering, aroma, dual purpose), origin, and characteristics.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|this is a great book...........love the concept and would like to get there, but it is hard.  have so much stuff that i can't bear to part with..................working toward moving from where I am to much simpler lifestyle
B009RH9J7W|3.0|this position is very uncomfortable, the device is too upright.<br />Vertical position is more comfortable, especially for reading<br /><br />It is a good case but not amazing
0375869026|5.0|My daughter's fourth grade teacher has been reading this book to her class and my daughter enjoys the book so much, she pleaded with me to purchase it for her as a gift.  My daughter was thrilled to open up this gift when she received it.  She said to expect some happy tears and some sad tears when you read it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|We had the first version and needed to move on to something new.  The graphics are really good on the kindle fire.  We keep getting stuck in the cave.  Soon we will master that too.  Enjoying the free download.
1609611543|5.0|I am so glad to find this book. I have had IBS and major problems for years. The last year I have been to one doctor after another trying to find out what was the matter with me. Every night I would wake up feeling like I was going to pass out and have a heart attack. It got so bad that I dreaded going to bed every night. I've been taken to the hospital by ambulance and had test after test so many times I've lost count. After going gluten free and staying on a wheat free diet I can sleep again, i've lost weight, I have more energy, much less brain fog and my life has changed for the better. I recommend this book and going GF if you have problems.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Have this on my phone and on my kindle fire.  I am able to go farther in the game on the big screen of my fire.  This is just a nice game to be able to sit and hang out with.  Another great fee download.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! My kids love it.  I didn't think it could be better than the original but it is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun but it should not be hard to steer a cart that's crab cra but its fun other wise so this game gets (bodabadom) 5 stars
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Anita writes about an interesting journey, it makes you wonder if there is perhaps some sort of 'afterlife'.  Quite convincing.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Out of all the angry bird games this is a fun game. I play when I don't feel like doing anything that requires thinking and need to relax
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Anyone considering this blu-ray edition is most likely already a fan of this classic 1956 film so I will address your one concern, yes it is well worth getting.  The picture and sound quality are well beyond that of any earlier release formats.  Altaira and Robby have never looked or sounded better!   Recommended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game. Kids love it. The horses are very life like. Like the sounds of the game. Great unicorn and rainbow options.  Maybe could add different pastures of flowers, etc.
B00A7ZXH4O|4.0|Overall, a good album with a few good dance tracks, some nice pop pieces and a few that don't bowl me over. But overall a good album and i'll enjoy those songs I like for a while to come.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|such an imaginative and unique little book. this was such an unexpected, lovely surprise for me. I am so glad I did not judge this  book just by the word 'circus'. Anyone expecting clowns and traditional circus fare would be quite disappointed-- this story and concept went way beyond anything I normally associate with the circus.
B0099G3I96|4.0|while the album doesn't really go any place new for no doubt but it has been a while since their last project. overall, a solid effort with a few outstanding tracks.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|Believable story and detective work that keeps you in suspense until the end.  It makes you want to read the next Kurt Wallander tale.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|while i was first exposed to imagine dragons via glee, it has been a nice surprise to hear their entire album. nice indie rock work with catchy tunes that capture this moment in time well. looking forward to seing more from this band in the future.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun to take care and get points<br />takes a long ti.e to load.  set your work tasks at night to get extra health and coin s
B006W0QOF2|5.0|has this guy made a bad film yet? this is is as good as the critics have said it is, and a fun movie too. you won't even know where the time has gone. highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Great improvement on the original, although I am still learning how to use the upgrades. Decent over all, except now I won't do my homework when I get bored.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|overall, this album sticks to the things I think Bruno does really well (love songs and ballads, which i can't get enough of) along with some fun &#34;other&#34; songs that nicely round out the album. If you like his last album, you'll probably like this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have always liked these kind of games because they give you a challenge that helps build your mind and memory.
B006C45CFG|2.0|....but it was a bit too formulaic and executed for my tastes. it could make for a no-thinking, more action than fun movie night. but i think you could probably find something better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is my favorite Nicholas Sparks ever. The story starts off suspensefull and ends with excitement.  I love that the romance begins. I cant wait yo see the movie.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|the reviews were great, but it was on sale. And I thought, why not. Well, now i know why and it wasn't even worth the sale price. but i guess at least it was on sale.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The aurthor kept me intense the entire time. I really enjoyed this book because it has many twists of faiths. I teal in love with the characters immediately.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Same size as 6th gen iPod nano. Puts a little more punch in harder to drive in ear headphones. For what it does, it's a real nifty item. Quick charge time and decent battery life (if I sleep for 7 hours, it's still running when I wake up). Very easy to use design. Clean execution of function buttons that prevent accidental activation (doesn't require adding a hold button). I would pay more if they keep adding features to the same design. I think they have a great idea here
B002SSUQFG|5.0|So far it has remained accurate to the second for a week. I check it with one of those atomic clocks. The price was excellent and shipping, as always, was superb. The best part of this watch is &#34; NO MORE BATTERIES &#34;.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy being able to combine the sounds in my own mixes for various moods and purposes. The fact that you can add together. Up to 10 is outstanding. I have not found any issues with this app so far, and I enjoy it very much. Looking forward to future updates with even more sounds!
B008HT4FUW|1.0|Don't think it is the Disc, something with my Bluray player and my AVR Unit.  I now have the normal DVD version and it works fine.
B000IOM1YG|3.0|I was hoping for something more like Turn of a Friendly card.. but its okay,  Service was great though. thanks
B006MW3V6U|3.0|If I have to see Thomas's face (footman/soldier/manager) one more time any where I think I will vomit. Same applies to O Brien, to Bates , to Carson, to Branson, to Isobel Crawley. These characters display the most one dimensional form of acting I have seen in a long time. Their lack of depth is astonishing. Whether this is the fault of the director or the actors I do not know. If the show had lasted four episodes maybe their lack would not be so painfully obvious but over two seasons , which is what I have watched so far.<br />The Crawleys have developed much more depth and character growth throughout the two seasons, especially Mary and Matthew who I think are wonderful actors and actors we will be seeing of a lot more.<br />Maggie Smith,Hugh Bonneville , Elizabeth Mc Govern, Iain Glen are wonderful in everything they do. They are experienced and talented actors and save Downton Abbey as an exercise in drama.<br />For a show where so much of the drama takes place downstairs amongst the the staff it is very short on substance and nuanced acting skills.<br />However, the show is quite addictive as I would imagine in the same fashion as soap operas.
B000IOM1Y6|3.0|its okay, but I was hoping for something more like Turn of A Friendly Card or Tales of Poe...  However the service and package were great
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really like this game but sometimes it freezes and then you lose your stuff  and when you contact them they don't do anything about it
B00846REIS|2.0|The book would have been better if I hadn't read read 50 shades 1st.  They were way too similar! Honestly, how many men could there possibly be that are insanely good looking, powerful in \\"all\\" aspects and great in the sack? My point exactly. Sorry Cross but I won't be finishing the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome. Me and my friends play it al the time on the bus. This app is very good if you have a kindle fire
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset works great for when it did work. Sound was excellent, the built in base in the headset was excellent and the mic is very sensitive (which i like) and easily customizable. The only down side is that my headset would cut in and out randomly every 5-10 mins. Sometimes sooner, sometimes longer. I tried different ports, not using the extension hub that comes with it and even tried the newest and oldest drivers they had available.<br />Their support was very helpful and agreed to swap with me. It may not be the speediest in support but they are willing to make sure you have a good product from them. If it wasn't for the need for me to send it back I would have given it 5 starts. Besides the bad QA overall well worth the money for this headset.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|How could you not love this movie. It is so funny. The delivery was very fast. The story line is great Chevy is super. The best movie he ever made I think
0307970299|5.0|I borrowwed the book form a friend and purchsed the audio book for another friend that is legally blind.  I enjoyed the book very much.  So much I thought my friend should read it.  She was a hiker is her earlier years.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Its an amazing combo! the packagge its 3D! i played like a child with it before opening the actual box xD<br />The set is nice, the movie looks great! the extras are a few, ill rather more, but enough for many.<br /><br />You recieve a bluray 3d, a bluray, a dvd and a Digital copy. and some surprises inside :D!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I can see why this was approved by Amazon for the Kindle Fire.  I'm left-handed, and I still find this to work for me, which shows its versatility.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I love this movie! the plot its kind of predictable, as a lot of spielberg movie's, but its awesome! its one of the kind of movies that makes u remember the exitement you had will watching Jaws, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters and a little bit of Cloverfield. The hand of spielberg its all over it! and the maestry of JJ Abrahams in the epic moments and the story telling its great!<br /><br />Combine Lost, cloverfield, Jurassic Park, close Encounters and Jaws, add a bunch of kids with an extremely good acting direction, thousands on VFX, Amazing Audio mix on the bluray, and a lot of emotional sense, oh! and of course a Big and angry alien! and you'll have just a slight idea of how amazing Super 8 is! a must have! :)
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|This was not good, just so drawn out and groan-worthy at the end. And at the beginning- I mean why talk when you can simply shoot? It'd save us 2.5 hours of trying hard to be cool. This was pretty much the first movie, which is not a compliment. Somehow there was an interesting movie in the middle, but the series was a roast beef sandwich made with stale bread if you know what I mean. Batman deserves better than this, as does the Dark Knight. Next time use Frank Miller's graphic novels as a script, please. Man, so many holes I can't even begin. Sigh.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A must have for all firefly fans. Ties up the loose ends from the series. I never tire of watching the movie. Funny, Heroic and adventure all in one.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I thought this book was brilliant and would make a great movie!  It had me hooked from the first chapter and I struggled to put it down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's really fun! It can get a little frustrating when you get stuck on a level but the feeling of success is amazing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the coolest game ever.  Me and daddy play every night and I win most of the time.  I like the Rio screens.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game! It gets super addicting and almost scary when you realize you're making a disease to wipe out humanity
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|was a gift...wife loves it. much better price than buying it in a store. might have to buy another one since wife will probably wear it out she listens to it so much.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|this album is very enjoyable. The old standards that are on this album are terrific and the harmonies and instrumentals are pure joy. Nice to hear the classic style and it is not over produced, so the sound is pure and lovely. Rossum's voice is deep and rich and warm. The fullness of her voice is not common in today's music world. Rosemary Clooney would be proud.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game with awesome gameplay and updates you want a fun exilerating game that places you in a train station scene you want subway surfer.  5/5
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books.  I finished all three in less than one week.  I am waiting for a second set to be written or at least a four book, with Christian's side of the story, a continuation from the eipilog at the back of the book.
B003719G40|5.0|My boyfriend and I read this together and I highly recommend that other couples read this together. I have already bought hard copies of this book to give to my friends as gifts.
B0036R92V2|4.0|Very good film. Tarantino approved film. One of the great classic spaghetti westerns on film, and one of the first.
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|What I LOVE about buying Amazon movies is that I can watch them anywhere, and my obnoxious 2 year old cant scratch the dvd! (like he has done to all of the existing dvd's that I own) It is a sound investment for entertainment. And usually cheaper than buying a dvd. From now on, I will never buy another movie any other way! I LOVE AMAZON!!
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My students learned so much about ancient China from viewing this film! And it's so funny! I was laughing out loud.
B008B92U32|3.0|The picture needs to be just right (like a mug shot) to make the swapped faces look good. Overall, I'm glad I grabbed it when it was the free app of the day.
B00000DLUV|5.0|I love this album. Anyone who appreciates good music should get it. The bee gees are amazing and either the cd or the dvd are good buys. It's also a good suggestion for a gift.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Sometimes messages I have deleted continue to appear in the inbox.  Also, I would switch the spam and trash button.
B000BQ7JRA|1.0|THIS DISC WILL NOT DO ANYTHING, AFTER PLACING IT IN MY PSP. ALL OTHER GAMES, MOVIES WORK. THIS ITEM IS NO GOOD.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I've read about half so far and there was one good story. I guess I really like to read mysteries.
0525953728|4.0|I ready the book in about 36 hours, I just had to read whenever I had a minute.  If anything, I wish the author could have given even more information about the mission for this country's greatest enemy.
B009NOVCSS|4.0|Everything I previously owned from the Stones was in LP format.  I never re-upped my CD collection because I never found anything (save for buying each and every release) that would have given me \\"the definitive\\" Stones collection. There was no \\"Greatest Hits\\" mammoth collection.<br /><br />And there still isn't, even if you buy GRRR! in it's biggest, most expensive, deluxe size!!  C'mon Mick and Keith!  You only turn fifty once! You should have pulled out all stops and put this collection out right!!<br /><br />The Positives:  I do give kudos to how great the collection sounds.  Songs have been expertly remastered; I have heard background sounds, layering and subtleties that I've never heard before. And it was a good call to sequence the songs in a fairly chronological order.<br /><br />The Negatives: I have two negatives, and both have to do with what got left off of the collection. Number #1: A fair amount of songs have been selectively edited for length.  Why not include the whole song, not just the radio edit?  If space was an issue, either fill up the CD to 80 minutes, or add another CD to the collection.  Of an even bigger complaint Number #2 was the choice of songs: Sacrificing what was left off (first-tier hits) in order to put in, in my opinion, second-tier filler (non-hits).<br /><br />Do you like the album \\"Let It Bleed\\"? Well, you are not going to get the title song, nor \\"Monkey Man\\" on GRRR! The classic \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is missing, as is: \\"Rip This Joint\\", \\"All Down The Line\\", \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\", and \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\".  Songs from \\"Black and Blue\\" like: \\"Hot Stuff\\" and \\"Memory Motel\\", and the great guitar solo on \\"Hand Of Fate\\" will not be heard.  Also missing is \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\", \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Let Me Go\\", \\"Send It To Me\\", and \\"Hangfire\\".  And you won't get Keith singing \\"Little T&A\\".  They could have at least added some live songs, maybe like \\"Going To A Go-Go\\" and \\"Midnight Rambler\\" (although you do get the shorter,studio version of the latter).<br /><br />So the collection is definitely overpriced for what is missing...but...even with the missing songs, this is the best you are going to do.  Or, better yet, burn your own Stones greatest hits collection so you get the fillet mignon you deserve.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's easy to make a personal connection with these characters.  I didn't want the season to end! Highly recommended. Get your laughter and tissues ready!
B002I0J5FG|1.0|I bought this game for a Zelda like PS3 game.  The game looks great but the controls are unbearable, I'm a casual gamer but I couldn't get past the first boss (the character refuses to climb, and is completely incapable of holding onto a moving boss) and don't even try to get on the horse, that's even more frustrating.
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|This is the first time I have ordered a movie from this company, An never will again! It took almost 3weeks to get to me, An never in that time frame did they give me a expect date. When i finally recieved the movie i put it in to watch it, An nothing, The movie said &#34;I couldn't play this movie in my region!  I was so disappointed.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Although I knew how it would end, The Martian was exciting and the story gripping and well told.  Yes there was  quite a bit of profanity, but that gave realism to it.  A great tale of survival and human resourcefulness.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Talk about a brain teaser.  Ordered as a Christmas gift.  My 9 yr old loves trying to figure this out.  Even my sitters enjoy trying to figure this out.<br /><br />Fun, entertaining, a bit frustrating, but enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! I don't know why but my multiplayer won't work I tried joining a map but it just won't let me... please fix this if this is the problem. Thank you
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great easy suspenseful read.<br />Love story that breaks free of a dangerous past into a safe warm future. Book leaves you refreshed not tired.
B008CIUS72|1.0|I want to watch movies and television shows that require Adobe flash.This is what I was sold and it didn't do this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can't wait for the movie :)  I really want to know what happens next.  I really liked all three of the trilogy!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good app. Very creative. Good entertainment for young children. Several levels which keep the game entertaining. Similar format to farmville and other step wise games.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I am hoping for a challenging experience!  My decision to purchase this game was based upon the description of the game!
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Some wear and tear on the case, but other than that the DVD itself works great, thanks so much :)

B001AXME2S|5.0|Awsome band. This is one of their best albums. Sound of madness, kind of the way the world is. Steeped in madness. Give this a listen.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Special effects were cool, weapons were cool, bike scene was awesome, hoping for a little more gun play myself. Looking foreward for next movie.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Interesting concept with time travel. I thought there were too many unneccessary details. It reads a little more like a history book than a thriller.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|I must begin by saying Ted is an incredably crude movie and may turn many people off because of that. However it would still be a great movie without its vulgar language, though the vulgarity is part of its stick. The chemistry between Seth McFarlane and Mark Walburg is amazing. Mila Kunis gives a decent perfomance though probably not her best work. The plot is pretty basic, but the comedy is great. If you are an adult watching without people in middle school or younger this is a great movie.
0446554995|4.0|Great reading. Loved the way it brought characters in from prior novels for interesting roles in this story. Liked the way events in prior novels were explained to support events and action in this story.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I dig this program. I'm sure that it will fall off of my radar in the next year or so, but the first few seasons definitely had my attention. One of the biggest selling points is the music. This show consistently has great music. I have discovered quite a few new artists/or have been introduced to others that have been around for awhile but that I hadn't listened to before.
1439102430|4.0|maintains her character well building off of what has been set forth in prior novels. Plots and focus build and change which help maintain attention.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is really awesome! I love the fact that it's wireless, plus it has it's own base with charging cable and everything. The surround sound is fantastic! I've never been steered wrong by anything Logitech yet!
0062213423|4.0|Bought this as a Christmas present for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it - she read it cover to cover, and still goes back and looks through it at least once a week.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! Once I Start playing I can't stop. It gets crazy the faster you are going and it is loads of fun.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game...like it much better on my fire than my iphone! Only thing is sometimes when I jump it makes me go sideways..can't figure out why but still a fun game.
B0082GQ5HG|4.0|Good movie and 3d effects. It's definitely a different type of production, but I really appreciated how much work went into this. Overall, good movie to have
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My son asked and asked me for this movie so I gave in ONLY because Wall-e looks like Number 5 from the old Short Circuit movies.  I have sat through this movie again and again with my son because I absolutely love it!  It's got a cute story line and it is very entertaining!
B005FDXT32|5.0|Great film and blu ray version was pretty impressive. Great buy for the price, will buy more as gifts when it goes on sale again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, its so much fun, I love the competitions. And I like that I can have quality time with her. I makes me feel like I have a real horse
0307744434|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down, the story line was fantasatic and very well written. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and stories about magic, also love stories. This book had both and I was drawn to it right away. The reviews that are quoted on the actual book are pretty stop on in reference to the topic and how good the book is. I hope this author continues to write, because I look forward to her future work!

Put down, word for word, so it can speak for itself.<br /><br />Books are banned everyday for discussing taboo topics. For making people uncomfortable. For being brutally honest. But I say...these are the books worth reading. These are the books that challenge perceptions and ignite fires. That stick with us. Leave hand prints on our hearts.

A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she's never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.<br /><br />Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he's nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn't at all who he's been claiming to be. When the secrets he's been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of Sky's life will change forever.\\"<br /><br />I could literally talk about this book for hours. I could tell you how wonderfully crafted the characters were:<br /><br />\\"I've never met anyone that puts so much thought into their own responses.

You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\\"<br /><br />But I'm not going to do that.<br /><br />Instead I am going to tell you about a girl who had no idea how to care. Who was convinced that tears made her weak. That protected her fragile mind by looking up instead of at. Who's entire world had to crash down before she understood the power of human contact. Who had to smile, and rage and forgive and understand before she could truly live.<br /><br />That girls name was Sky, and Hopeless is her story.<br /><br />It is sad. It is taboo. It will make you uncomfortable. It will make you question your morals. It will ask you if wrong IS always wrong. It will make you cry. It will make you smile. It will make you observant. It will confirm that you are human.<br /><br />It's THAT kind of book.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I like a lot of the movies put out by Studio Ghibli and Disney. It's a very good movie about a little girl who learns not to be afraid.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel as it kept me wanting to know what really happened in her past that led to her adoption or kidnappping. It really plays on your emotions and makes one think about how adults can forever change the future of a child. Deep, heavy, serious subject played out in real life. A very good read.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|I do really like this movie, especially since Heath Ledger is in it, but it is a little racy. Lots of sex! Probably not something to watch with the kids, but definitely a girls' night movie!!!

B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love most of Nelson DeMille's books.  Particularly those with the wisecracking John Corey.  Corey and Kate teamed up with Paul Brenner was even better.  The story was interesting, well written and held my attention.  I found the ending unfulfiling and long for the sequel.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I have always liked to play the Pac-Man game on any machine that I have ever played on. I am not very good at it but I like it and the games that are similar to it.
B007NU54H4|5.0|Bought this for our grand daughter for Christmas.  Watched it with her about a month later.  A really good story for kids that shows the power of believing in yourself.  She LOVES the DVD.  A must for any Tinker Bell fan.

B004FP1WX0|4.0|We watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend and it was all that they said.  It is socking and disturbing and at the same time a little sad.  In today's world where we live so much of our lives online it will definitely make you a little guarded.
1938469011|5.0|An excellent book on hops. It improved my brewing ant taste expectations. A lot of information and historical facts led me to review the choises of hops for my brews.<br />This book is interesting not only for brewers but beer geeks/lovers too.
B00321GTJU|5.0|What can I say that isn't in the title.  Planet Earth has some of the most stunning visuals I've ever imagined.  The sound can be a bit obnoxious at times, but losing yourself in the visuals, on an HD tv is def worth it.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|I obtained this book as audio, in three parts. I listened to the first part faithfully and with interest, but I had no real desire to pick it up again. I found great characters and a believable future, but for some reason I ceased caring what happened to the gene-spotter and the wind-up girl.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|From the opening scene of this movie you know it is not going to be an easy watch for those offended by nudity, drug use, or foul language. Since that stuff does not bother me, I had no issue with it in the movie. Most of the plot has been rehashed in other reviews so I will not do that here. Whip was not an easy guy to like he was arrogant and so full of his own importance that he failed to see his life imploding around him. Therefore, it was only a matter of time until he screwed-up so seriously that it would all come crashing down around him- which it did an amazing fashion. At first, when he knew the jig was up and was still refusing to accept responsibility for his actions, I admit, I wanted to throw something at the tv. However,as I watched on and saw the transformation, the moment he finally \\"got it\\", I knew this movie would stick with me long after the credits stopped rolling. While I could not give it five stars because of some of the more contrived plot elements, in the end this movie had some positive messages. It is reminder that our lives can always be turned around as long as we are willing to accept responsibility not only for our actions, but the need to change our lives into something we want it to be. Losing everything is tough; sadly, for some people bring your life as low it will go is the only way you lift yourself up.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|This is a nicely made product.  All of the seams are well sewn and straight, and it appears that it will last for awhile.  The ruby red color is very attractive.  Of course, this type of case does not protect the Kindle when it is out of the case and being used.  If you are prone to dropping your electronics, it would probably be better to use a case that stays on the Kindle all of the time.<br /><br />The case also fits the original Kindle Fire, as well as the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" model that is listed in the product description.  Out of curiosity, I tried my iPad Mini, but the case is just a fraction of an inch too small for that.  I am currently using the case to hold a couple of external hard drives and the associated cables.

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Needed a USB to Ethernet adapter for Work. So, my rule is if I'm going to spend money on anything, close to the top is money worth spending, and better future-proofing. Mainstream chipset for long-term support is a requirement also.<br /><br />Already researched the available drivers and it had 2.6.x source for Linux. Downloaded the small .zip and waited.<br /><br />It showed up a day earlier than expected, though it took almost a week of time. I could care less about Windows 7/etc compatibility -- I need Ubuntu compatibility, specifically 10.10.x LTS since that's the last LTS before the too new 12.04 (thanks IT).<br /><br />Well, the 2.6.32-45 kernel is up-to-date enough for this driver, but the kernel headers (netdevice.h) was missing netdev_err(), netdev_dbg(), etc macros that this driver needed.<br /><br />Quick Google search found the necessary macros in the 2.6.34 kernel headers, copied them into my netdevice.h:<br />make<br />sudo make install<br /><br />replug, ifconfig<br />or<br />reboot<br /><br />and 'lo blue connectivity light, and green flashing activity.<br /><br />Data uploads over this on USB 2.0 (yes Work hardware sucks) about twice as fast as the 10/100 adapter I was borrowing.<br /><br />Time-saver worth the trouble.

B008220DGE|1.0|This was simply the strangest and consequently worst film I've seen in a long time.  It appears that the people who have effusively praised this film are the so-called professional film critics for various media outlets. We who attend a film to be entertained didn't get it, didn't like it, and don't recommend it to others.  Unless of course you really, really want to see Philip Seymour singing \\"I Want to Get you On a Slow Boat to China, a cappella, to Joaquin Phoenix for no apparent reason other than he could.  I have it on good authority that L.Ron Hubbard who will live for another 75 million years even though he's really dead didn't like it either.  Paul Thomas Anderson suckered a lot of people.  Don't you be suckered too.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Item arrived on time but upon opening it the disc had a few scratches on it. It was completely unreadable in my DVD player or on my laptop so I emailed and asked if there was anyway I could get a replacement.

B00B3D7ZQU|1.0|The original album was great and I've already reviewed its faults. However, here I am reviewing the addition of two new songs. \\"An Sylvia\\" by Schubert was never a great lieder. It was and still is a butter-churning piece of mediocrity. Even La Streisand cannot raise it to a new level. There WAS a reason it was left off the original album. \\"Auf dem Wasser zu singen\\", also by Schubert, didn't make it either, and the reasons are very evident to those who care to listen: it's dreary.<br /><br />So, buy Classical Barbra Remastered only if you value the remastering process. The additional two \\"out-takes\\" do NOT add added value.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When reading the &#34;English&#34; reviews I realized 95% of the Brits are VERY disappointed in Season 3.  We Americans are little more forgiving...thankfully!  I'm certainly not happy with the deaths of two of my favorite characters, but not enough to stop watching all together.  I'm looking forward to Season 4.  Downton Abbey is still the &#34;Best Dressed&#34;...&#34;Best Acted&#34; series I've ever had the fun of watching.<br /><br />The only flaw, as far as I'm concerned, is Thomas!  I have never cared for the character's choice of lifestyle, and could have done nicely without ever having to watch him &#34;in action&#34;.  I do get very tired of him always being so mean and then ending up with a &#34;promotion&#34; to a higher rank in service.  Guess &#34;PC&#34; was alive and well back in the early 1900's too.<br /><br />I was thrilled to be able to purchase Season 3 before it actually played out on TV.  So now there will be a long dry spell before the &#34;fun&#34; begins again!  But owning all 3 seasons on DVD, I can always have a &#34;Downton Abbey Marathon&#34; whenever I feel the need!

0143112589|4.0|Lamentably, the creator of one of Britain's best-loved series of comic crime novels passed from the scene in 2009.  But fueled in part by the long-running BBC series of televised Rumpole tales, his stories continue to enjoy widespread popularity amongst readers in search of an entertaining read combined with incisive social commentary.  Rumpole and the Reign of Terror fully lives up to this impressive tradition.<br /><br />When the husband of one of his nefarious clients is arrested as an alleged terrorist, it falls to Horace Rumpole, the indefatigable British barrister and eminence grise of 4 Equity Court, to stand up for the man's human rights.  As he weaves his way through the vagaries of the new security legislation (with occasional stops at Pommeroy's Wine Bar for his favourite libation, Chateau Thames Embankment) Rumpole must also grapple with his other half, known as She Who Must Be Obeyed.  It seems the redoubtable Hilda has taken to locking herself in the box-room of their flat, and Rumpole is understandably confused.  Is the aging barrister equal to the occasion?<br /><br />John Mortimer's deft satire can always be counted on for many a laugh combined with penetrating insights into the British legal establishment.  In a story that could have been lifted off the front pages Mortimer provides a refreshingly light and literate anodyne to much of contemporary crime fiction.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really good. It has fantastic graphics, and it's easy to keep up with. The only issue I have with this game is, that you have to spend real money to do some of the things you need to do. Other than that I think it is a really great game for all ages.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|It's been a while since i've really listened to Tegan and Sara, but when in heard &#34;I Couldn't Be Your Friend&#34; I immediately had to buy the album. I'm so glad I did because I had forgotten how much I loved them! I love this album - it's a bit different than what their old stuff was like, but it's still awesome!
B001H9MYPW|3.0|I really like this show a lot but the dvds came in individual cases which blockbuster stickers on each. So don't judge my rating based on the show. The item was described as in better condition than it was. I have not been able to watch DVDs yet; I hope they work well because this is a great show.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|I just had to uninstall the game because the game froze. I was near the end when froze. Other than that, I was enjoying the game up to that point.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|love the sound of celtic women...soothing and relaxing, intense melodies........when driving the music keeps me calm...and in florida traffic that is important
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I couldn't believe it didn't get good reviews.  It was wonderful.  The visuals were stunning and I loved the Tharks! I don't know how many times I have watched it and enjoy it every time.  I was put off by the name at first, but I'm glad I went past it.  When I read about it, I couldn't believe the Civil War soldier transported to Mars!?! As the movie moved along I thought, it made sense to me.  I'm 70 years old and I love science fiction, I've seen enough of the real deal.  I just wish they would make a sequel.
B008B92U32|1.0|This app just seemed like a bad joke.  I picked a photo, swapped the faces, and that part worked pretty well.  The problem is that it pixelated the faces so bad that we were almost unrecognizable.  Disappointed and uninstalled.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very good book read it in a little over a wk, couldn't put down, tear jerker you will be surprised about dean holder.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this book in school when I was younger and its one title that has stuck with me since then. I'm not too articulate, so I can't go into much detail. I'll just say I really loved this book.
B006CHML4I|5.0|very handsome and rugged looking timepiece, looks exceptional and feels comfortable on the wrist - felt it was well worth the money for this automatic watch
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love that you can get multiple locastions on the weatehr channel app.  Also like that it was free thanks
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game it's the best I'm good at this my sister plays this they love it too and my parents like I sais it's the best game ever
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have played this CD almost every day since I received it, 15 days ago.  It is one of my favorite CD's
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm not sure how to “properly\\" write a review for a book. But as i read this book, you realize it's so realistic when it comes to the conversations or inner thought that you can't help but read it as if you ARE Charlie and you're just rereading something you wrote. You read it with the same honesty and passion as Charlie describes his experiences.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who's ever felt out of sync with life.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|One of the best of all time, it never gets old and it stands the test of time - -
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it should have a least more mystery boxes. Also should keep it so they're aren't any advertisements.Thank You.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|GOT THIS APP AND IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME. NO TIME LIMIT. YOU TRY TO BEAT YOUR OWN SCORES. GREAT FOR ANYONE THAT ENJOYS THESE TYPES OF GAMES. TIME GOES BY REAL QUICK WHILE PLAYING THIS. LIKE IT!!
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|I love this movie! The picture is so clear too its almost like you can reach out and tickle the chimps toes. I recommend this for anyone of all ages.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|Excellent new British mystery series.  Jason Isaacs is a talented actor who can play a variety of parts very well.  Enjoyed him also in &#34;The Enemy Within&#34; and as Luciius Malfroy in &#34; Harry Potter.
B000002LSV|5.0|One of the greatest hits album of all times the guys know how to rock and they are still doing it today!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|No stars. Have tried for two days and will not download.  Will on my iPhone.  Why have an app for a kindle if it does not work and you cannot tell why.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like the game put I was hoping for the same update as my phone so if you can, can you up date the mlp kindle tablet edition thanks
1616550414|5.0|With no 'The Art of...' book The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia is the next best thing.  Informative for any Legend of Zelda officinato.
1592407889|3.0|This was a hard book to read..... Not because it is poorly written.....but because of all the abuse Sachi had at the hands of her parents...physical..emotional..and psychological.....lets not forget sexual!!!!!...it's amazing she can function at all in any normal manner today!...Steve Parker was a very sick man on so many levels....I'm shocked Sachi has a picture of him in her house....as for Her mother... WOW....now I can see the evil mother and grandmother she was Playing in the recent Downton Abbey was really her...I've always heard the statement concerning parents...&#34; They did the best they could&#34;.... Her parents only did the best they could do for themselves....their daughter never entered into the picture....I've seen dogs that are better parents... Wait that's an insult to dogs!!!  Sachi... Keep your distance .. She will only keep hurting you and take down the picture of you father and burn it!!!!!
B008ASGP3U|3.0|I don't think this novel is as good as others by Ian Rankin that I have read.  The ending was pretty far-fetched and dependent on the murderer confessing on his own and leaving out Rebus and his part.  Even though he was beaten up and frightened by a victim's brother, the reader is asked to believe that the murderer will walk into the police station and not only confess but provide the whereabouts of the undiscovered belongings of his victims which is the only physical evidence that connects him to the murders.  Another thing I don't like about so many police novels is that the crack detective is faulted, hampered, and even discredited by those in authority even though he has the best solve rate and was always correct in previous cases. Not only did two superiors disdain his theories, but The Complaints and Fox were after him too.
B005XRU62C|5.0|Any fan of &#34;Florence&#34; will love this album. Her haunting vocals combined with the big Bass Drums captivates and then catapults the listener into ethereal bliss. A wonderful confusing dance of floating and flying at the same time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Quite a skilled and clever writer.  I was amazed at how everything was plotted by Amy and how her sick mind controlled every detail and she won in the end without revealing her conspiracy to anyone but her husband.  Almost as good as Barbara Vine - am I remembering her name correctly?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Entertaining book can't wait to read the series to find out where this story is heading. Good if u like fiction
1609611543|5.0|The recipes are fantastic you never get tired of them and you feel very good eating what you make!<br />I Highly recommend this book to everyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game it is kid friendly and I recamind it to every one under 13years of age
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|If you grew up in three culture of the 1980's, loved arcades and video games,  or just like a fast-paced and intriguing mystery this book is for you.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Many others have done a great job reviewing this book so I will only add a couple comments.  Beyond the writing, the insights and perspective on attitude, choice, freedom, judgment and the influence of circumstances is poignant and riveting.  This is one of those books which seeps into your soul and alters your behavior and the perspective with which we see others.
B004JK61K0|1.0|It was suggested that I try this to get mail on my KindleFireHD by a customer service person.  It didn't work.  Not surprising since everything else that was tried on my Kindle didn't work either.  Do you think they will ever call back?
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome show so far, love the option to stream from almost any device, would definitely recommend you spend the xtra money and buy in HD, worth every dollar
B00AHG9KYE|4.0|Another great story by Alex Clarke. Not as exciting as the first three, but good nevertheless. Good read! Needed a better ending.
B00000DIII|5.0|I'm a stubborn soul when it comes to music; it takes a lot for modern bands to impress me. Since their first appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Sheepdogs have been a beacon of hope for classic rock sentimentalists like myself. This album is an amazing homage to what music once was and a guiding light for what everybody wants music to be. Their imaginative riffs, outstanding vocal displays (from all members), and trademark \\"feel-goodery\\" is evident from beginning to end. The Grateful Dead-esque \\"Alright OK\\" is largely my favorite, exhibiting harmonious creativity and the pleasant surprise of backwards guitar popularized by The Beatles. \\"The Sheepdogs\\" is a must-have from this future hall-of-fame band out of Saskatoon.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham delivers on this one.  The plot twists and turns and keeps you entertained.  Well worth the time.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
0805092447|5.0|This is a wonderful book by Eric Carle that takes children through a series of animals by asking \\"what do you see?\\" The story starts with a Brown Bear and the reader asks, \\"Brown Bear Brown Bear what do you see?!\\" And the bear responds, \\"I see a Red Bird looking at me.\\" The reader continues to ask the animals what other animals they see until you get to the end and review. It's a wonderful book for children and is yet another instant classic! Children will love asking the question \\"what do you see?\\" and naming all the animals! I love having the children in my classrooms act out the animals, name the colors, and bring the story to life! This is a MUST HAVE for every children's library! I would highly recommend this book for anyone who works closely with children, parents and teachers alike!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Puller is out and about looking for the bad guys.  As with most Baldacci novels, this one interested me as I live in the same geographic area (Mid-eastern US) as where the story takes place.  Wonderful, entertaining read and an enjoyable book.  Just one discrepancy:  In the book, Puller makes a comment that concrete grows weaker as it gets older, while generally, the opposite is true.  Concrete gets stronger with age, if it is made & mixed correctly when it is placed.  Not a biggie, but I noticed it.  I am sure all Baldacci fans will like the book.
0307352153|4.0|Not a word to be found.  Flip flip flip. Oh wait, here's something.  A quiet, zenlike drawing of a cup of tea and a sleeping cat.
1592407889|1.0|I did not find the parts of this book that I read of much interest. As a former personal assistant associated with a star - I understand the seduction of these words \\"You should write a book. Your story is so interesting.\\" And I can say from personal experience that none of those people are what I call friends.<br /><br />I relate to the emotional struggle of dealing with the choices my own parents made that affected my life. Those struggles shaped the man I am today. And when I take ownership of my life I don't feel like a victim. I can also relate to the feeling of someone I care about saying things about me in public that have hurt me. True or untrue. I find nothing fascinating about supposition and memoir that can only hurt someone in the end.<br /><br />I did not enjoy this book at all. I wish the author would have written more about her own life instead of what she thinks happened in someone else's life.
B002FU42NE|5.0|We love all the songs on this. Some songs remind me of the 80's & 90's , which I grew up in.
B003L77G06|5.0|I love this show! They are hilarious! I received product in the mail quickly. Product works great! I have watched them all in 1 weekend they were that funny.
B0000DZEA1|2.0|I like the cd but it came with the case all cracked and broken so the disc slices around inside the case.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I love this show! They are hilarious! I received product in the mail quickly. Product works great! I have watched them all in 1 weekend they were that funny.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|great movie during the flight scene, thereafter, it was a mediocre movie. a bit predictable when you know alcoholism, i am not sure who the intended audience was.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|One of my alltime favorites. I saw the movie when it came out in 1964, and I still love it. I highly reccomment this movie.
B002RZZIXK|5.0|I enjoy William Boyd's books and the intrigue. This is an amazing story of one man's ingenueity in circumstances of losing everything and the final outcome.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|LOVE IT,LOVE IT,LOVE IT!!!!!Can't say enough about this artist.  He's really good. We saw the movie and I ordered the cd right away. This is not something I usually do,just couldn't help myself.
B0006419J6|4.0|Great movie, top of the case was kinda cracked but besides that GREAT MOVIE. I would definitly recomend this movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all 3 of these books in under a month i could never put it down. the story is so wonderful, mysterious, loving, spicy. Its the best romance/ bdsm book ive ever read (and ive read quite a few) i like the fact that there is real love involved and a good story and twists. I wish the story can continue or at least do a prequel. Every book leaves you wanting more and more of the delicious Christan Grey. I literally felt every emotion weather it was heartbreak, sadness, nervousness, anger, happiness and of course HOT AND BOTHERED ;-) So sad to see it end and i cant wait for the movie. IT BETTER DO THE BOOK JUSTICE :-)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For the price -  yah can't beat it. You get what you pay for..lots of space for your equipment ..
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I was looking for a simple, usable note-pad to keep a daily to-do list handy. It's uncluttered and easy to manuever through.
0547564651|5.0|The book,  How Children Succeed, came recommended by a very well respected source. We will probably choose this book as our next book study. We are a Toddler-Preschool age Montessori School. We are currently reading The Gifts of Imperfection by Brene Brown.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I rated this five stars because I could not put it down...can not wait to see the movie now. Different than any other book I have read
B001NLKT60|4.0|This entertaining trilogy really ought to be one hard-back book. Each book does not stand on its own very well. That said, the three book trilogy is expensive, but entertaining, even addictive. And less expensive than most other addictions.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Interesting, but not nearly as good as the trilogy.  As soon as I finished the third book of the trilogy, I immediately began reading this book.  I didn't find it nearly as well written or informative as I expected.  Yes, I enjoyed getting some history by reading this book, but it just wasn't as compelling a read as the previous books.
B004U52VPS|2.0|Nothing real engaging or fun.  My daughter has played with it once since she got it two months ago.  She REALLY wanted it but I should have spent my money on something else.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore writes fantastic music. I was a little afraid that it would simply be a repeat of the LOTR, but it it is beautiful in its own rite. Some of the same themes are recognizable but changed to fit the new story. The text that goes along with the music is well done and informative.
B00846REIS|5.0|For some reason, I like this series just a bit better. I like that they both have baggage, ex's, more heat. Cary is a great extra character that brings way more depth to the story. I like side stories other than the main characters. He seems like someone we all know but doubtful we know his demons.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|This is a film i will watch over and over until it sinks in. the ending was like magic to me. I think the writer and Aang Lee are amazing at what they do. If you liked this try Brokeback Mountain if you have not already. Aang Lee has a way of making you truly care about the characters.<br /><br />I would ike to see what Aang Lee could do with Avatar: The Last Airbender. Since M. Knight totally ruined it. Please some one tell Mr. Lee to push to reboot that series.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I fell in love with the characters in this movie. Helen Hunt was brave and real as usual.  This is a must see.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great show! I was addicted after the first episode of season one! I can't wait for next season to get started.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Great album at a great price!<br /><br />The CD was delivered in a timely manner and in excellent condition.<br /><br />The more I listen to SRV, the more I think he may just be the best!!
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|That is the gist of it. Nice dual storyline going and the journey to the end doesn't follow exactly where I usually predict.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Doesn't lag on my kindle fire hd and i love it more than the original temple run but it doesn't work on my android phone
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The way he narrates this tale is effective. His characters are very very fresh. Enjoyable page turner that I couldn't put down and now must wait for more...
0765325950|5.0|After nearly two decades of waiting, I was not disappointed.  I had to pace myself but man, it was difficult.  Brandon does a great job of wrapping up Jordan's masterpiece in his (now familiar) fast-paced style.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see the movie, only 4 more days!<br />I feel like at the end the book kind of just dropped off, I guess not the ending I was expecting.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|the color is great. it came as if i bought it in the store. couldn't ask for anything more. everyone wants to know where i got it and i tell them AMOZON!
B0049P1VHS|3.0|the dvd is working at the moment i havent sat and watched every episode and everything yet i have only skipped to see if anything would mess up because when i got my package the cd had been knocked out of the holding place and was scratched up on the back. hopefully it works good if not then i will not be happy with my purchase but from what i'm seeing from the most part it is working right now. but from now on they need to make sure thier stuff is going to stay in the disk holder and not fall out.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm not even finished with it and I don't want it to end.  I can't believe there's a year to wait for the third book!  I feel like I live with these characters and fully care about their outcome! Ken Follett always writes crowd pleasers.... hurry up, Ken, with book #3!
B003L77G8I|4.0|The case was in pretty good condition, but the discs are little messed up. I can play them in my laptop but not in a normal dvd player. It's slightly disappointing.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|I think Helloween give to us the best album in a decade. Nothing more to say than it's a great album, all songs are good, who is a good thing since on their previous 2 albums some of their songs was not their best... my opinion only... Overall I recommend this album to all peoples who love that band and power metal... I'm a long time fan of Helloween, since 1988, and even if they get older, they are better and better...
B000ATQYT2|5.0|the film is amazing and the film was shipped and arrived in a timely manner and the disc was unscratched. The case was a little bit beat up, but that is to be expected for a used dvd case.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A very good read lots a action, I'm hooked can't wait too start the next book. Lee Child is a great writer
1616550414|5.0|Outstanding! A must for any true Zelda aficionado. I could not be any more pleased with the quality and contents of this book; the in-depth artwork and written details chronologizing the Zelda franchise and legacy are wonderful!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows on television! I would highly recommend this if you have not seen it!
B002BX4VEK|5.0|After rightfully reclaiming his iconic status with the 1968 comeback special, Elvis Presley wasted no time in capitalizing in his revitalized status as a relevant artist. In early 1969, armed with a series of ace musicians and legendary producer Chips Moman, he began some of the most prolific sessions of his career at American Studios in Memphis, where he consciously set out to record the highest quality original material since the early 1960s'.<br /><br />The resulting album, \\"From Elvis in Memphis,\\" confirmed that Elvis the artist was back, forever kissing goodbye the soundtrack fluff that marred his 1960s' output. The record was tough, gutsy, soulful, with fresh, modern arrangements and The King rarely if ever sounding better. Though only one actual hit single came from the album (the classic \\"In the Ghetto\\"), each song is a gem, spectacularly delivered with a newfound passion not present on an Elvis recording in almost 10 years.<br /><br />Over forty years after its release, \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" has finally received the `Legacy Edition' tradition it deserves. The original record has been beautifully remastered and padded out with several bonus cuts that didn't make the original record. Additionally, it is coupled with its follow-up, \\"Back in Memphis,\\" which is almost as good a record with several highlights; like its predecessor, it also features several bonus tracks, in this case the classic singles that originated from these sessions, including his last # 1 hit, the timeless \\"Suspicious Minds.\\"<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful, with a great booklet featuring an insightful essay and several rare photographs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love taking care of my horse. You can compete, bath, and dress them. It's like taking care of a real horse.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Bought this for my nephew's birthday.  He loved it.  Especially the extra's.  And blu-ray is always a plus.<br />Thank you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is totally cool I am from Germany and can never put it down. Everyone will love it. peace!!!
B000A2H812|3.0|Good party band, and great to see in person.  I can only listen to the album for so long before I'm ready to give it a break.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this was a fun game. I beat it in 1 night so I wish it was a longer or more challenging game
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Awesome movie...love the actors.  Morgan Freeman always takes a good part in any movie he stars in.  I have seen a lot of his movies...love him!!  Super actor
B008TRUDAS|4.0|The characters in this book are so easy to relate to. I could not put this book down. Will be reading more books from her! Great twists in the story line.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a middle school teacher, I feel strongly that every student between the 4th and 8th grade should read this book. What a sadly true depiction of how cruel kids can be sometimes, but also how one act of kindness can multiply. This book will either be read aloud to my classes or offered as a literature circle option.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Paul Simon said this was his favorite album- I totally agree. Songs show what a great songwriter Paul Simon is- includes great African style music-especially the vocal backups- Linda Rondstadt sings on one- Graceland, You Can Call Me Al?  The tunes are in my head for days.  EX CELL ENT !!!!  If you see the PBS show or DVD about this concert- you will understand how this project came together and how magical it was.
B007ZUX8CK|5.0|I purcahse this book for my 5 year old Grandaughter who lives  in Florida. I was scheduled to visit her and ordered the book in advance for it to arrive before I. Everyday for a week we waited anxiously for the books arrival. When the book arrived my Grandaughter was elated. She loves animals and read the book to everyone who would listen. Happy with the outcome.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun and addictive but it costs a lot of energy to search rooms so I can only play for a short amount of time if I don't want to pay.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I have great childhood memories of this film. I  sent the 2 disc DVD to my 5 year old granddaughter. We both agreed the best part of the story is the spaghetti kiss. Share happy memories with your grandchildren by purchasing this item.
0670026603|5.0|THis was a quick read.  It really started a good conversation starter about assisted suicide between my BF and I.  Really shows the love people can feel for each other when life isn't what we think it should be.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So moving. I related to this story and it helped me talk about my past with an abusive partner. Must read!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was really inspiring to read. If I was August, I would not know how to handle the bullying. He was a really brave kid and there were a lot of thought-provoking things in the book! I thank the a
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|So I'm off the deep end for Cure Vinyl these days...<br />I picked up Entreat so how could I resist a 180g minty copy<br />of this studio masterpiece...
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller was great, shipped fast, no damage. But, alas, this PS3 controller has made like all my other PS3 controllers and the left joystick sticks up. I cannot blame anyone, as it takes several months, even with my furious jamming of the left joystick while playing fast-paced FPS's
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a book for a mature audience, in stark contrast with her traditional focus, and that might turn off some people who expected otherwise, but this is a compelling, beautifully written, engaging story
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Great book! It is well worth the read again and again to remind us of what is important in life.
B00634GHJA|2.0|i cant get photos to transfer and it takes several attemps to get it to reconize my kindle fire when i have tried to transfer from computer to kindle fire
B001RUXW48|1.0|Not a triumph for Leonardo DiCaprio or Russel Crow.  The story was very hard to follow and not entertaining at all. The acting was poor. Did not like at all, nor did my friends of family members.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Now I have read Pollyanna Grows Up. It has been a wonderful read. Both books. Thank you for providing these great and free classics.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|Definitely one of Bad Religion's top 5 albums! This album has \\"Suffer\\" and \\"Against the Grain\\" soundscapes! Fast, Punk! Everything that Bad Religion is! This band will never sell-out the fans and punk rock!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was well written, and had an unque story. Some of the story line was violent and gruesome but not beyond what was expected for this story.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I had high hopes for this one. I thought the acting was good and I liked the aesthetic. But the pace of the thing just felt uneven, like they crammed two hours into the second hour of the movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the animation and sound.  Just a cute game.  Love it and I'm 61 and my grandson and I compete for high score
0143035711|5.0|From how a hellicopter works to what it was like in Vietnam this book is great, I am reading it for the second time.

B009JTCBLE|3.0|When I first heard Cold, I got the spine tingles that have been so rare in heavy rock lately.  I snagged Afterglow without a thought or waiting for Amazon's MP3 listening posts.  Whooooops. Regifted.  At this point I have to plagiarize another reviewer - something is not quite right.  I had to go put '2' on and see if it was the same band, producer, whatever, whoever, and yup it's them.  So what happened.  On '2' Glenn was hitting notes that a man his age shouldnot be able to his unless he has some serious danglers.  On Afterglow he's singing like a man twice his age, but forgot to notice that fact.  I started listening to Glenn after Gillan left my fav band Deep Purple.  Figuring they are about the same age era, on '2', Glenn blew Ian away.  On Afterglow, Glenn is in the aftermath.  Ian tailored his vocal and writing for notes he could hit .  It sounds like Glenn thought that voice would last forever and he pushed it way down the line, and the voice totally blew out on a majority of the songs.  Bonamassa seems to que in on the stretch for notes and did the same - 1 or 2 notes to many or too fast in a solo, turning songs to mush.  The rhythm monsters jumped on the band wagon.  Not sure if Bonzo II is hurting again, but it sound like it..  Maybe Glenn just opened his mouth just toooooo wide on the last tour.  The production guys - it was like going from Pink Floyeds Wish You Were Here to Animals. A serious knob turn the wrong way.<br /><br />I really thought these guys might pull off the next G & R and last past 3 albums of the same line up and some solid chart whoopin' rock n roll.  If Afterglow is any clue, it's not going to happen.  But at least they are still around, and maybe they actually care about their fans, might read a few reviews and tighten things up for the next album.<br /><br />If you are reading Glenn -  please close your mouth a bit on your bass solos. -  Not sure why he does that.  It's weirder than watching Pete Way play bass.<br /><br />Give us another '2' and all is forgotten and boughten.nother '2' and all is forgotten and boughten.

B007UPNA6Y|4.0|The latest Jack Reacher story is entertaining and I enjoyed reading it. For Reacher fans its another good read with his usual type plots.
0345803485|1.0|Alright I can only say I am glad that is over! I refuse to read the rest of this trilogy! Aside from the bad writing I site the supremely disturbing tampon scene! I have no idea how this is a best seller! You can really tell this started as a twilight fan fiction because it is as just as badly written as those books were!<br /><br />Ana is annoying and stupid, Christian is a total sadistic power tripping jerk with serious issues and the book is so repetitive.<br /><br />I have no problem with the mommy porn aspects or the BDSM. However I have doubts the writer did much research into dominance and submission. I am no expert by any means but I have read several articles and books on the subject and Ms. James really missed the mark! If you are really interested in the genre there are better authors who are more knowledgeable. Check out Cherise Sinclair, Leah Brooke, Sophie Oak or Chloe Lang if you want stories about BDSM that are well written and not a ridiculous affectation!

B00AB0AR2U|1.0|The worst of the trilogy. I would have gotten more from sitting outside and watching the grass grow...\\"IN WINTER\\"! Acting was as lame as the storyline.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A harsh and brutal country produced people as evil as its own history.  Small glimpses of love and compassion are not  enough to overcome the sorrow we must feel for the children of Ireland orphanages. Well written, extremely accurate and unfortunately all too common.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story kept me interested....I needed to know what was going to happen next.  I couldn't wait to see how the story ended....ugh!!! Not what I wanted or expected.  I just wasn't satisfied with the end of the book.  Left me frustrated with having read it at all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abby, I don't know why, but I love it.  The series is beautifully produced with great attention given to period detail, but a few things seem out of place to me from time to time.  When Lady Sybil is near death (during the child birth scenes), Lady Mary sits on Sybil's bed to comfort her and they have an important  private conversation.  During the conversation, Lady Mary exclaims \\"blimey\\", which is British slang used by the lower classes.  Up to this point, I haven't even noticed the servants using common slang, so it came as shock to hear Lady Mary say \\"blimey\\".  We have now entered the post WWI period in the series and the world is changing, so I can believe that Lady Mary may have heard some slang words during the war.  But, I find it hard to believe that a person of Lady Mary's breeding would spontaneously use a common slang word like \\"blimey\\" in a conversation.  Granted, Mary was shocked by what Sybil told her, but a word like \\"blimey\\" sounded completely out of character for the refined Lady Mary.<br /><br />Here are some other anomalies: The series is as much about the servants as it is about the upper class and we have been introduced to new servants as they arrive at Downton, right down to the newest and lowest kitchen maid.  However, there is a new male servant who is seen in the kitchen from time to time, but he has never been mentioned and one ever speaks to him.  Who is this mystery servant who is only seen in the background and will he ever be introduced to the viewers?  Speaking of servants, where are all the gardeners?  Downton is a giant estate, surrounded by well maintained grounds, and although the estate has a large staff in the house, we never see a single gardener working on the grounds or interacting with the household staff.  And, who has taken over chauffeur duty now that the original chauffeur is part of the family?  At this point in history, many cars still had to be cranked by hand, so none of the remaining members of the family would be driving a vehicle.  Also, the chauffeur did more than drive the car in those days, he also doubled as a mechanic, because cars or that era required a great deal of maintenance and the Lord of the manor would not have maintained the car himself.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great when i want to check status when out and about where free wi-fi. thanks for the great app! no more to say!
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson continued to keep the tone and suspense of Jordan's writing right up to the end. I enjoyed the book immensely ... even the 200-page chapter.

B005LAJ22Q|1.0|I watched this season and at the end the main character tells the group that the doctor at the CDC told him that everyone is infected and its just a matter of time before they change also. This was first seen when the sheriffs friend turns to a zombie without even being touched. Are you serious? Oh by the way sheriff, your wife is pregnant also. Come on. As the world turns has better stories in it than a no win like this. The human mind wants some kind of hope in their life, how do you get it with that? Almost the whole season takes place at a farm that herds zombies in a barn. Anybody know what the ammo count is? I am a zombie-olic and love any movie zombie but this is getting just plain boring. Lets see if they can pick it up in season 3.
B00943SP0G|5.0|It is a really good movie, not great! But, I love anything that Johnny Depp is in and recommend, do yourself a favor no small kids in the room. the one scene I hope you are ready to explain. After seeing in the theatre I was embarassed for the parents there.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Co-written and directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Spaced). See this excellent film as soon as possible.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|Not that glamorizing drug use or dealing is a good thing, this is a film which captures the '70's scene quite nicely thank you very much.  The true story of the exploits of George Jung creates an entertaining movie out of what must have been a dubious dicey life of this person.<br />Johnny Depp is a brilliant character actor but I have never been impressed with him as a leading man.  His performance here is kinda a exception.  He shows how a basically good human being can get caught up in a whirlwind beyond his control. Greed, adventure, love and the love of the good life surface through the performance.<br />Paul Reubens is adept at showing Derek Foreal as a real person behind the ruthless,powerful, gay facade.<br />Again, never got off on Penelope Cruz, but she fit here and did a yeomanlike job.<br />Each and every supporting performance is without peer.<br />Rather like this motion picture.

B00AF6B22E|3.0|FLIGHT has an A-list cast and direction in a C-list story. I understand why so many people had such mixed reaction to this film in the theaters. Here is one of the best action footage of an airplane in trouble over a rather dreary and mundane story. The action happens early in the film and then the adventure fizzles.<br /><br />We know from the beginning that Pilot Whip Whitaker, played wonderfully by the great Denzel Washington, has a drinking and drug abuse problem. He knows how to fake \\"sober\\" as he gets into the cockpit of his plane but the signs are clear. While into the flight, the plane is struck by mechanical failure and certain doom is on the horizon. The few minutes of a flight in peril were amazing and spellbinding. This is filmmaking at its best as it grabs the attention of the audience and we feel the peril.<br /><br />Whitaker performs the miraculous and saves the plane with only 4 lives lost. He becomes an instant hero having saved the majority of the occupants from certain death. Here we have the fascinating moral twist of the story. Whitaker is legally drunk while at the helm of the plane. Here is the moral conundrum. Despite being intoxicated, it appears that Whitaker is the only pilot on earth who could have saved the plane from a deadly crash and a total loss of life. It is thought provoking situation to consider as the NTSB investigation begins. Here the promise of the story is muddled in a stream of predictable cliches. Whitaker begins a romance with a drug addict on her way to being recovery while he decends further into the depths of his hell. The story becomes so tedious and so predictable that all interest is lost.<br /><br />Don Cheadle has a understated role as the pilot union attorney eager to keep Whitaker \\"clean\\" and ready for the investigation. While Cheadle is understated, add in John Goodman in a flamboyant roll as the drug dealer. So many talented actors in a mediocre film.<br /><br />The light of the film returns near the end of the film as Washington gives his all to Whitaker. Finally, we see why Denzel Washington is one of America's top actors. Will there be redemption? There is a great twist to the story that finally adds credibility to the story.<br /><br />FLIGHT is a film that excels at the beginning and at the end--everything in between is the low point. So much potential was missed in what could have been a great film.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Read reviews and download the app and I have to say it's great.  The only problem is that the time on the app is 30 mins behind, not quite sure is this normal.  My grandson enjoys the satellite function.  Would recommend this product

B004GUSG4M|4.0|S.J. Watson has written an interesting and enthralling story.  At first,  it was difficult to get into but I continued and was rewarded further on.  The writing really captures the difficulty of loss of memory.  I thought that the author did  a good job at plotting and focusing  on the arc of his characters.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Second release vastly improves on the first. Enough variation to avoid the seemingly relentless repetition of the first release. Great challenges and achievements to keep it interesting. Enjoyable.

My kids think it's pretty darn funny that Dad is into Rap. I am very interested in traditional Opera and have attended Operas around the country. I don't know what Mr. Lamar would think about it but this certainly seems like a Rap Opera about life in Compton. I love it!!!  I love it!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I certainly wasn't expecting how much I would be absorbed into this book.  I am a fairly slow reader but I finished this in 3 short nights.  I think I'll read the series again.  That's how good it was.

B0053KWDES|5.0|Bought this Amp to allow me to use two headsets at the same time without losing volume.  Works very well and really improves the sound, particularly in the bass.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is really well written. Flynn is ale to describe the thoughts and emotions of her characters so beautifully that I felt like I was living in each character's mind.  At the beginning each character had me empathizing with them but but half way through the book I really disliked them both.  That is the problem for me with this book.  there was not one single likable or admirable character, not his sister, her parents or the police.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and adventurous. This game is worth wasting tour time on. Lol. Its great quality is magnificent. Well on my tablet. But like i said great game.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a really fun game for me. The graphics are much better than the first, and it provides me hours of fun. This game definitely tests your reflexes with the speed of your runner getting faster as time goes on. Overall, great job on the game, and I would recommend this to anyone who liked the first Temple Run.
B002GKQ5MY|4.0|Realize a few things:<br /><br />1) Although there are scenes of women making out and breasts are shown, the show is not pornographic.  There is a larger emphasis on the relationships between the characters.<br /><br />2) Every character is a lesbian, but it's not the same type of lesbianism that you see in pornography.  If you don't know the difference, then I would advise against purchasing, since you'll be disappointed.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I purchased season 1 & 2 at the same time in Jan, so only just now got to the Christmas special episode on season 2. At about 30 minutes in, and for about 20 minutes mostly during the trial, the DVD blips and stutters deplorably before at about 52 minutes, becomes normal play again. It's not worth the trouble returning the set for this but do hope to catch a re-run of that episode off TV to see that part again. When I found out others were complaining too of DVD quality, I thought it polite to add my voice to the concerns.
0525953728|5.0|For a book that the DOD was worried was going to reveal top-secret information - they need to realize that their own people leak more classified information than Mark Owens ever would have.<br /><br />After reading this book, not only do I have much more respect for SEALs (not that I didn't have any to begin with), but I realize that you have to be a certain person to achieve the credentials and accomplishments that Owens and his team did.  For that, I salute their service.<br /><br />In many ways, I wish that parents overall held the same standards of strictness when raising their kids, as the SEALs do when it comes to discipline, hard work, and determination.

In the case of t his book I looked forward to when I could sit down and resident reading and was sad when it was over, and Iread this book unless than a week. It had some crazy twists. I prefer Peeta over Gale and feel l Iike Katniss struggles with allowing herself to love which comes across as not being interested in Peeta. I hope she ends up with him. :)
B004S5FW1U|4.0|I like sports, not a tragic fan, but know many. It doesn't matter which sport - fans are fans everywhere.

Enjoyed it, loved the interaction w the Indian fans. Good feel read - for me,one of thosebooks to red in between 'heavier'  stuff.

1591844096|4.0|The idea of becoming a &#34;linchpin&#34; is an interesting way to understand your everyday contribution at work. I am not sure everyone can become one as Mr. Godin suggests, however, I think it an excellent way to look at life. You have to work, so why not make it an enjoyable experience where you challenge yourself everyday. It beats being a &#34;cog&#34; where you are just part of a machine and humdrum through the day.
B00A2H9LK6|3.0|I enjoyed this movie on some level. The first had more atmosphere, but this one has a likeable heroine and some decent scares. The horrible American accents nearly ruin the movie, though.

B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Tragic role that Denzel had to play, he did a great job.  He really deserves the nomination.  Could drag a little in the middle of the movie.  Well worth it.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. The story line did not have gaping holes and the acting was reasonably well.<br />Just good mindless entertainment.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|Mail Online is a British online publication and because the UK is not like the US and more of a police state be prepared to be censored heavily. Saying something as much as the UK is so much smaller that the US will get you censored, there is no rhyme or reason to what will be censored, because it is manned by people with varying IQ's, the writing as well can be abysmal and they never proof read what they post, so some of the articles are a bit ruff, however it is free, and they take articles from all over the internet, images from the Library of Congress, articles from other publications, including personal tweets and publish them, so at times it can be very interesting, and kind of a one stop shop for info. The only thing that really bothers most people is the censoring of comments.
B0006J28BO|5.0|This is a great Full Length Animation by Studio Ghibli. The story is a great reminder that we all have something special inside us all. As always Studio Ghibli has made a movie we can all enjoy.
0743270754|5.0|Reviewed by Tim Wheeler at peoplesworld.org<br /><br />In this 150th anniversary year of the Emancipation Proclamation, we are fortunate to have Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals to help us understand Abraham Lincoln and the abolition of slavery.  It goes together with Stephen Spielberg's film Lincoln that has been nominated for several Oscars.<br /><br />Goodwin brings the 16th President of the United States to life, a plainspoken frontiersman who seemed to come out of nowhere. Lincoln was a rawboned circuit lawyer from Illinois, born in a Kentucky log cabin, with one year of formal education - the \\"rail splitter.\\"<br /><br />Goodwin portrays him as a generous, outgoing man, fond of telling jokes. He was a brilliant political strategist and tactician who defeated rivals far wealthier and better connected than he. Having won the presidency, Lincoln turned around and named his rivals to his cabinet.<br /><br />Lincoln held his cabinet together against all odds. Yet on a grander scale, Lincoln held the Union itself together, spearheading a coalition that ranged from abolitionists like Frederick Douglass to border state politicians like Maryland's Montgomery Blair.<br /><br />Goodwin paints on a broad canvas, depicting the nation's capital during the Civil War. Her book reminds me of Margaret Leech's Reveille in Washington, likewise a Pulitzer Prize winner. Yet Goodwin delves far deeper into the political and ideological roots of the struggle.<br /><br />I found especially moving her portrayal of women in the struggle.  She quotes letters Frances Seward wrote to her husband, Secretary of State William Henry Seward, chastising him for retreating from his abolitionist principles and even criticizing Lincoln for concessions to the slave power. Goodwin stresses the enormous loss suffered by virtually every family from illness, a tragedy multiplied a thousand-fold by death and maiming on the battlefield.<br /><br />The dramatic highpoint of Goodwin's book - and of Lincoln's presidency - is the Emancipation Proclamation that freed \\"henceforth and forever\\" three-and-a-half million enslaved African Americans.<br /><br />Lincoln was facing one battlefield defeat after another. The death toll climbed above half a million.  He had reached the conclusion that the only strategy to save the union was to free the slaves. They then enlisted in the war to defeat the slave power, something long advocated by the great abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass.<br /><br />Lincoln decided in the summer of 1862 the time had come. He drafted the Emancipation Proclamation and read it to his cabinet July 22. Seward warned that if Lincoln issued the Proclamation immediately, it would be seen as an act of desperation. Lincoln agreed to wait for a Union victory on the battlefield.<br /><br />Gen. Robert E. Lee crossed the Potomoc into Maryland with his army and engaged the Union army in combat at Antietam on September 7, 1862. By the end of the day, 6,000 soldiers on both sides were dead and 17,000 wounded. Yet Lee, defeated by the Union army, was forced to retreat.<br /><br />It was the victory Lincoln was waiting for. On Sept. 22, the White House announced that Lincoln would sign the Proclamation January 1. Goodwin writes that the announcement was greeted with joy in the streets. Mass rallies were organized hailing the Proclamation.<br /><br />Yet the \\"copperheads,\\" so-called \\"Peace Democrats,\\" campaigned during the 1862 midterm elections against Lincoln's decision to free the slaves. They called for a \\"peace\\" that would preserve the slave power and extend slavery. The \\"copperheads\\" won big gains in that election, whittling the Republican majority to a razor thin margin in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Lincoln was deeply depressed by the election results. But he stood his ground. The Proclamation was signed and sealed.<br /><br />Goodwin quotes Douglass's reaction that New Year's Day: \\"We shout for joy and we live to record this righteous decree ... Will it lead the President to reconsider and retract? No, Abraham Lincoln will take no step backward.\\"<br /><br />Goodwin alludes to a letter of congratulation Lincoln received from the \\"workingmen of London\\" (page 504) for signing the Proclamation. Lincoln replied, \\"The resources, advantages, and powers of the American people are very great.... It seems to have devolved upon them whether a government, established on the principles of human freedom, can be maintained.\\"<br /><br />Goodwin, referring to exchanges between Lincoln and the International Workingmen's Association in London, was talking about an organization founded by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. This was the labor-led movement that blocked England from recognizing the Confederacy, a crucial victory in the isolation and ultimate defeat of the slave owners.<br /><br />Many of the IWA messages were drafted by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, co-authors of the Communist Manifesto in 1848. Horace Greeley, publisher of the New York Tribune, recruited Marx and Engels to write a series of columns on the Civil War.<br /><br />Lincoln had working relations with German socialists who had fled Germany after the Prussian defeat of the 1848 democratic revolution in Germany. Some ended up in the United States, Joseph Weydemeyer, for example, a close associate of Karl Marx, was commissioned by Lincoln as a Brigadier General in command of Union troops defending St. Louis.<br /><br />Lincoln was not a communist or even a socialist, of course. Yet he stated clearly in his first State of the Union speech, Dec. 3, 1861, that \\"labor is prior to and independent of capital.\\" Goodwin's book dramatizes that, above everything else, Lincoln understood the imperative of unity. He was a pioneer in helping build a new kind of coalition that abolished slavery and saved the union.

B005PWPUW6|5.0|I had ordered this to replace an old ART DI/O which is failing. I was required to deploy it to the wife's computer as an easy solution to hum elimination on the run to her LCD TV on which she watches Netflix movies in a dual monitor setup from her computer. When in doubt, go SPDIF...<br />We're using the optical input from her Creative 24 bit X-Fi soundcard, but before installation, I tested the coaxial side with a 24 bit 96kHz SPDIF feed of about 20 feet in length. You simply choose optical or coaxial via a switch on the bottom of the unit.<br />Both optical and coaxial work great. Typical to a good DAC, there are no perceivable artifacts, and no intermittent clocking. I am using both the RCA audio jacks as well as the stereo 3.5mm audio jack. Power is supplied to the unit via a mini USB jack. I tested briefly using a rear panel USB jack instead of the included AC adapter. Once again, a success, meaning that you can power this from an unused USB jack if your AC power strip is full.<br />The unit is solidly built, in a metal case.<br />5 stars for this unit. In fact, when I complete this review, I'm ordering another one. The old ART DI/O still needs to be replaced.

B00AW0KHMY|1.0|Great movie, could have followed more details of the book but I loved it. BUT...Everyone should just skip this edition and just go with the Walmart Two-Movie Set for $24.96. I would only buy this edition if it had some Robert Pattinson DNA in it. Since that will not be happening I'll be..S.K.I.P.P.I.N.G. over to Walmart, Target and Best Buy for the best editions.

B005LAIGOQ|2.0|Right in the middle of watching this movie on TV I was loving it so much (for I love classic gothic ghost stories without all the gore) I felt compelled to see if I could purchase it here.  I almost purchased it before finishing watching it and I am now glad that I waited, for I hate bad endings.  Who cares if he and his son were reunited with his dead wife in the afterlife, after being killed by the woman in black?!  They were still killed and the ghost goes on, free to kill again and again.  For me, catharsis is very important in watching a movie, and I never experience catharsis, with a bad ending, when the hero gets killed.  This move was excellently made and delightfully scary, but I will never want to watch it again, and especially will not want to own it because of the let down of the bad ending.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This game has held my interest longer than most. Love to play it with my 7 yo daughter. Even though it is a bit more than most games there are no hidden charges later.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Never had a chance to finish the movie as sound was not working after about 5 minutes into the show.
B0073COMKW|2.0|I am editing my previous review.<br /><br />The first one I got is great, so this original review was good<br />It is bright, but not too white, and good price.  The best part of it is the small size, it fits in small fixtures, whereas other LED 60W replacements are wider diameter than incandescents and wont fit in all fixtures.<br /><br />I ordered another one to put in an identical fixture in the same hallway. Unfortunately the new on is more white than the last one, so same bulb, two different colors, and the new one was not pleasant like my first one.<br /><br />They are the same part number and box, except the boxes are slightly different shades of the same colored, like from different manufacturer or lot.  This is really annoying.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I love this book so much! It really pulls you into the story! Rich Riordan is an amazing author! Read the rest of the series!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption was a very powerful drama movie with amazing acting job by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman what was most shocking was the fact it was wirtten by Steven King never knew he had a talent for more then just horror and suspense triller books.  To me this is one of best movies ever made in movie history,  some people feel this 2 disc special edition deserves more special features but I think it had enough special features.  But no matter what people say this is a truly great movie and deserves to be in anyone's drama movie collection for all time.  Also for some it shows how life inside prison really works day to day year after year all its dirty little secrets.  But the main character played by Tim Robbins was right about one thing in the movie Hope they can't take away from you to paraphrase the line from the movie.  Because as for myself Hope is all that is keeping me going besides my Faith in God watching over me everyday of my life on this Earth.  So in closing if you have yet to watch this movie and enjoy or want to see a great drama movie and one of finest movies ever made then buy this movie and add it to your movie collection.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great graphics, the game was just challenging enough not to be frustrating. Good sound quality. Hidden objects were a little obscure at times, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Worth the money.
B0002XNT0I|4.0|This movie Philadelphia starring Tom Hanks and Washington is a very powerful movie with powerful message about how you can fight for what you believe in and win.  Some say the movie is overhyped, but in my viewpoint I still give it four star rating because of the fact the actors did a great job on the movie and brought the characters to life amazing even me to this day as one of my favorites in my drama collection of drama movies.  The movie impacts many people and characters inside the movie, some scenes were hard to watch because of the language used but what was touching was the character Washington played had his eyes open in a way to not be so judgemental about people and how they live their lives.  This is just a movie I know but if we had laywers like Washington's character in real life that honest of a man then we might have a much better future on this Earth. So if one person can be impacted then the whole world can believe and fight for what they know is right and win the cases that need to be won.

In all honesty even though its so soon after having seen it this could easily be on my top 10 films of all time. I loved this movie so much. The first film was great, but this film is on a completely higher plane. This movie totally enraptured me and anything i say feels like its not doing the film justice. Its perfect.

0865479186|3.0|He keeps going, and going, and going. Finishing the book felt like a chore.<br /><br />The main problem is that he goes into too much detail, and Ben's ego sometimes gets in the way when I try to enjoy the book.<br /><br />I would recommend reading instead [[ASIN:0393337782 Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine]] to learn about most medical topics in this book, and [[ASIN:0307275175 The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives]] on how statistic analysis can be flawed.<br /><br />On the plus side, sometimes his explanations really made sense (hence the 3-stars \\"it's ok\\" rating). Here are a couple of examples:<br /><br />\\"people who performed particularly poorly relative to their peers were unaware of their own incompetence; but more than that, they were also less able to recognize competence in others, because this, too, relied on 'meta-cognition', or knowledge about the skill.\\"<br /><br />\\"humanities graduates in the media, perhaps feeling intellectually offended by how hard they find the science, conclude that it must simply be arbitrary, made up nonsense, to everyone.\\"
B007KZY1YY|3.0|The plot is captivating, though the quality of writings and the language author uses is quite poor. Easy to read, easy to follow.<br />Both main characters have huge problems. There is a strong desire to slap Anastacia Steele to make her more decisive, strong.

B001QWC3NS|5.0|Molded to the contour of your foot. Great material, antimicrobial, looks awesome. No need to ever buy another type of sandal. I also paid about $40 less than you can find them almost anyplace else. I waited about two years to buy these. When the price came down due to the time of year or a holiday special, I jumped at it. I could not be happier. I found as did others that they run a bit small so rather than get a 9, I bought 9 1/2 and they are perfect. When you first get them they are a bit stiff but with each time you wear them, they start to soften up and mold to your foot. All pros, no cons.
0425264351|5.0|I have read 4 jack Reacher books and this one beats them all so far.<br />All the rest get 9.9 but this one is a 10!
030758836X|3.0|I thought the story was great.  There were a lot of twists and it was a fun read.  However, unless a sequel is planned, the ending was very disappointing.  I can't say I shut the book and thought \\"wow that was great\\"...it could have been...it had the potential, but I was kind of mad when I finished it...looking at the last page thinking \\"THIS IS IT!?\\"  I think it's worth reading and if there should be a sequel, I'll definitely be reading it.  Other than that, it was just a book that could have been great but was spoiled by such a terrible ending.

However, there are no minecarts or boats, or redstone, but there is the ore.<br />With the new update theres a bunch more stuff, like cakes, eggs, buckets, and now you can milk cows.However, theres still no redstone or boats and minecarts.which really stinks.But the update is still a huge improvement.Next update should bring more ways of transportation, as well as redstone. Although the computer version is way better, this is good for on the go
B009VMN3RA|3.0|First off -- the promos on tv, the subjects discussed in interviews with Ms Parker, make the book's content seem way more scathing towards her mother than it really is. Having just finished the book, my impression of her mother was mostly positive. I went in with great sympathy toward Sachi as she comes across very sweetly, and almost fragile in interviews. But the anecdotes where her mother really crossed the line were mostly incidental to her overall life, and toward the latter part of the book I had mixed feelings and many more questions.<br /><br />I feel some of the venomous comments in these reviews are a bit sexist. A high profile man who let his current or ex have primary custody due to his 'big' career, would not get such a public lashing. But we expect a lot from women and we tear them up when they miss the mark. It may be that film/tv stars or others with big careers, shouldn't have children at all...because while the details are different, the basic story is all too familiar.<br /><br />I have read hundreds of biographies and memoirs (though typically avoid THIS sort as they are usually shallow and self serving, and often horribly written to boot.) I've also read most of Ms MacClaine's books and was a fan. I always found her written words about her experiences fascinating and original, and she had broad interests outside of the entertainment business, and was who she was without apology.<br /><br />I had also been interested in the unusual relationship Ms MacLaine had with her husband Steve Parker, and how and why that worked.<br /><br />The most compelling and best written parts of this book in  my opinion, are those that explore the author's father, Steve Parker. I won't spoil it by revealing too much, but there are some surprising revelations about him that gradually unfold, and that is well done and credible. You can tell that Sachi had some real energy around this part of the story, the incredible mystery of his life and persona. I would love to see Sachi explore his life in more depth sometime. High profile women are frequently targets of these con artists, so it would be really interesting to know more about their inner workings.<br /><br />Overall I have mixed feelings about this book. I  wouldn't say it's written poorly, (and Ms Parker credits a co writer), but the 'voice' to me does NOT match that of the author I've seen in interviews, where she comes off as intelligent, ironic and insightful. The book is written particularly in the early parts, in a very basic style that seems aimed at about a sixth grade reading level. This may have been a marketing decision based on the assumed demographic of the prospective readers, or a choice of her writing partner, but I found it off putting. That does not apply to all the book however. There were later chapters and anecdotes that almost seemed written by a different person, someone with more subtlety of thought, where the humor and irony show through.<br /><br />Now for the content. I am probably one of the few who feels that Ms MacLaine does NOT come off that badly, particularly when you consider the size of her career and compare her to peer-mothers in her business.<br /><br />There is a reason that so many children of stars end up tragically, because while they are in extremely privileged surroundings, they are also usually profoundly neglected. The careers of their parents are all consuming, and that goes for powerful people in many walks of life. The difference for males is they can more easily find a decent and trustworthy 'wife' sort to keep the home fires burning while they conquer the world. Not so easy for powerful (straight) women to find that.<br /><br />Anyone with a large life inevitably develops a matching ego, and \\"art is a jealous mistress'' demanding everything, so the families pay dearly.<br /><br />I have had personal acquaintance with a few people in this category and noticed the price they pay. The children are always an afterthought in theirlives, but trotted out to make the parents look good for PR reasons. Even famous people who had very good or even 'saintly' reputations in life, have left some pretty damaged people in their wake, and it often comes out after they pass. The mistake Sachi's mother made was not giving her enough money earlier on, so it wouldn't be as tempting to write this book, at least while she's living.<br /><br />The combination of privilege and neglect is a recipe for ruin. If you want to create a monster or a candidate for penal institutions, combine material spoiling with neglect..it works. Many kids of stars virtually raise themselves, with indifferent ever changing help looking on, these kids later make the news with their arrests and suicides. Sachi did not end up a criminal or addict, she is obviously resourceful and bright, so that is a testament to something.<br /><br />So with all Ms MacLaine's self involvement, brusque manner and eccentricities, she came off to me as an overall caring mother who was there for her daughter when she could be and was always happy to see Sachi. For example driving two hours from LA to San Diego to intervene with a shady boyfriend, and take Sachi out of there. A lot of 'normal' mothers wouldn't even have done something like that. Mine wouldn't have.<br /><br />The incident where Sachi was 'forgotten' and had nowhere to go during a boarding school holiday (which had to be a summer holiday, since she mentioned going to a northern Italian beach with the family who took her in, and people being in bikinis, it's cold there in winter so could not have been Christmas as has been mentioned). That was awful, and the parents 'forgetting' about her was sad. But as Sachi herself lays out, her mother truly did not know Steve Parker's real nature til much later, and Sachi didn't seem to tell her any of the bad things going on with her dad til much later. At which point Ms MacLaine started divorce proceedings.<br /><br />The fact that she was truly Japanese in her cultural outlook, possessing reserve and self effacement, may have been part of her reluctance to speak up. Also she was frightened of her father and always wanted to please her mother. She existed in a surreal kind of world where she didn't know where she fit in, where she didn't have peers or relatives with whom to identify and commiserate, and that would undermine anyone's confidence.<br /><br />In reading, I began to really wonder however if Sachi maybe did embellish the truth in places. For example she wrote of being two when she first flew to Japan, yet said after three  months there she was speaking fluent Japanese, better than English. Most two year olds don't speak fluent ANYTHING, even precocious ones. If this is true she would likely be of genius level IQ, and then her writing style should reflect that giftedness (it doesn't).<br /><br />The last third or so I began to really lose sympathy. Sachi seemed to have a sense of entitlement that her mother wasn't doing all she could to get her acting parts. Then there was a scene where it was said that her mother actually sabotaged her getting a certain part. She lost me there. Her mother actually did give her lots of entrees, including to the noted acting teacher, Peggy Fleury, and to other opportunities. Having an actor in my family, and knowing how viciously tough the business is, the opportunities Sachi had were a huge leg up. If she didn't get a major career, even with the connections and introductions she got, perhaps there's a reason beyond her mother's 'sabotage', as painful as that might be to accept. I would doubt that in later years her mother was powerful enough to put the kybosh on any project, as Sachi implies she did. Sachi may be a fine actress, but her strong resemblance to her mother also could have hurt her for some parts.<br /><br />Another subject that strained credibility was where Sachi spoke about her anorexia (claiming she weighed 80 pounds at 5'6'' -- most people at that height and weight would be very very sick!) and yet was working at a noodle restaurant and was considered voluptuous next to the small Japanese women!? Of course that could be just distorted anorexia thinking, but no way would someone that size look 'curvy' even standing next to a tent pole!<br /><br />These kinds of things left cracks for me in her overall credibility, although I do believe that most of what she relates probably happened.<br /><br />I was also turned off when I looked at the photograph she included of her nanny that she had described as stout, and ugly as a toad, yet the picture of her, where she was identified, shows a pleasant looking Asian woman of normal size! So the body dysmorphia even got projected onto others. I couldn't help but feel sorry for that woman, who was a caring kind person, and obviously was a good influence on her, being described like that.<br /><br />I guardedly recommend the book. It has merits beyond its subjects, that is of the cost of celebrity and the ironic fact that those who can seem the 'luckiest' from a distant view are actually in pretty sad shape. Since so many today worship celebrity and material wealth, books like this can be a good wake up on what those things really cost.<br /><br />I do hope she keeps writing, because she has a lot of ore to mine in her unusual life, not just as a celebrity's child, but the bi cultural experience, and living with someone who leads a 'double life' (her father).ese in her cultural outlook, possessing reserve and self effacement, may have been part of her reluctance to speak up.

B009UWYFFK|4.0|Each time my daughter and I watch this good movie she gives me the biggest hug. That adds the fourth star. If she still reacts that way in another year or two I will have to increase to five.
B008I43DYU|4.0|There is nothing special about this app. It does what it is supposed to do, add, subtract, multiply and divide. It comes in handy when you want to do some calculating.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|While the book was interesting and compelling (I had trouble putting it down) it left me feeling empty.  I am not sure I could recommend this to someone else.
B004H8GM3K|5.0|I saw the movie but had no idea of the details.  This is a well written book about a poorly executed battle.  I am sure the military has invested lots of money on crew resource management.  These soldiers did everything they could to stay alive, God Bless them ALL.  Serious heros for trying to help a country who didn't appear to want help.  No good deed goes unpunished.....<br /><br />Highly recommend this book!

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|One cannot help but wonder how a talent such as Susan Boyle's could be hidden for so long.<br />I count her among the greatest vocalists not only in her clarity and range but in her ability to control the timbre of her voice as well as the mood and tone of the song--every song. She provides an interpretation that leaves one completely satisfied. One can simply listen and enjoy or actually study and marvel at every deliberate syllable. She is a complex talent. Susan is a highlight of my December each year. I begin waiting for the next album as soon as I get the new release. She belongs with the unforgettable vocal standard bearers like Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. Susan<br />Boyle is a true poet.
B005EY2XFC|4.0|A classic tale of good and evil where almost everything is black or white. A good mix of cops and robbers and the super natural.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This makes the 3rd time I have read this book.  I am always amazed at the helpfulness of the information within the book.  Make a person look within themselves and realize that things said to you aren't always directly related to you, but the way the person saying it feels.
B0067EKY9K|5.0|Lasse Hallstrom must be a chameleon, as he inhabits the worlds within his films. Watching Salmon Fishing in the Yemen in the theater had me thinking about the truly delightful 'small' British films like Brassed Off, also starring Ewan McGregor. This film is wonderfully quirky and heartwarming.<br /><br />The director has given us equally exhilarating and offbeat films including Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and The Cider House Rules.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I do not know how this made it on the best seller list. This is one of the nastiest books I have ever read. This Author has a fascination with pornography and the ending leaves you hanging. I would not recommend this to read and I will not read any other books by this Author writes.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am 59 and started looking for a gaming mouse and computer system.  I bought the new Toshiba X875-7390 3D system.  I then purchased the Anker DS-2368 mouse.  It has a wonderful feel and the extra buttons are placed in the perfect location for my fingers.  The extra weights that are included gave it a great feel and also help keep the mouse under control.  The programing of the buttons is very easy and I dont think anyone would be dissapointed if they buy this mouse.  Even if you are not using it for games it is perfect.  I dont see anything that I would change at this time.  And the price is very affordable even for those on a tight budget.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.<br /><br />Michael

B0030V0PEW|4.0|Atul Gawande is a physician interested in improving surgical practice.  He reviews surgical cases with disastrous outcomes that could have been prevented and cites research claiming that nearly half of deaths that occur in surgery are in fact preventable.  We read a detailed analysis of a drowning accident in which the young victim's life was saved against all odds.  Why?  Because the hospital staff had discussed and practiced the procedures to treat cold-water drowning ahead of time.  They used no new knowledge; they just coordinated and communicated more effectively.<br /><br />Gawande examines how human beings do things.  There are two reasons we fail at complex tasks.  The first is ignorance.  We correct it by conducting research and building schools to increase our knowledge.  The second and more common reason for failure is ineptitude--the right knowledge is available, but we do not apply it correctly.  People continually forget, are distracted, or skip steps because they seem unimportant.  This problem lurks below the radar; we don't recognize it, let alone try to solve it.  Instead we send people off for more training to increase their knowledge.<br /><br />What is needed instead is a simple way to remind people of what they know at the right time to make a difference.  We have an answer, we just aren't using it.  \\"Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures.  They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit.  They not only offer the possibility of verification, but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.\\"<br /><br />The author examines checklists used by airline pilots, building contractors, investors and other physicians.  In these professions work has become too complex for even a talented individual to perform alone.  Teams of skilled experts must manage both communication and complexity to succeed.  They do both with checklists.  These checklists make people stop and think at \\"pause points\\" to ensure that the right things have been done.  They get coworkers to bond as a team by requiring them to talk to each other.  As a result, people become comfortable enough to speak up when they see a potential problem.<br /><br />Chapter Six, The Checklist Factory is the instructional meat of the book, with recommendations that help us develop good checklists.  There are direct guidelines about brevity and clarity.  There are also process guidelines about identifying common mistakes and fine-tuning a checklist with field testing.  He distinguishes between READ-DO checklists, which march novices through the tightly specified steps of rote tasks, and DO-CONFIRM checklists, which provide checkpoints for experienced professionals solving complex problems in coordinated groups.  Both have their place, but DO-CONFIRM checklists have the most potential to make a difference.<br /><br />There are barriers to checklist use.  They have a serious user acceptance problem.  Many accomplished professionals consider themselves virtuosos who don't need help from other people at all, let alone somebody else's checklist.  To many others checklists seem too mundane to make a difference.  The author works hard to persuade us.  His own research on checklists in operating rooms finds significant drops in death rates, post-operative infections, and other outcome measures.  He highlights successes at prominent hospitals to encourage wider acceptance, asks administrators to impose requirements, and calls on nurses to help change the culture of the operating room.  The idea is slowly catching on.<br /><br />Gawande wishes we would move more quickly.  \\"In the money business everyone looks for an edge.  If someone is doing well, people pounce like starved hyenas to find out how.  Almost every idea for making even slightly more money ... gets sucked up by the giant maw almost instantly.  Every idea, that is except one: checklists.\\"<br /><br />I learned some things from this book and highly recommend it.Give it at least a quick look, starting with Chapter 6.  It has the potential to make you even better at what you do best.Give it at least a quick look, starting with Chapter 6.  It has the potential to make you even better at what you do best.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|You already know what the book's about.  I'll restrict my comments to my opinion of the book itself.<br /><br />No Easy Day is a good read.  It goes quickly, and it has some very interesting info about how the SEALs and specifically DEVGRU operates.  Thankfully, he saves us from reading yet ANOTHER account of BUD/S.  If you're a gear-head, he lists some of his gear by name. If you like picking up slang, he offers a few SEAL phrases.  The detail about the Abbottabad raid is terrific.<br /><br />So, it's a good read.  It's not a great read.  I don't think it's particularly well written.  For example, in several of the pre-Abbottabad battle scenes I couldn't *really* follow the action.  I found myself wondering \\"WHERE is he, relative to other stuff?  East?  North?  WHERE are the other guys?\\" -- so I stopped trying to follow so closely and just read for overall impact.<br /><br />So, if you're at all interested in the topic read it for what it is.  I think you'll enjoy it.
1442359315|4.0|It is interesting to hear a &#34;man of science&#34; tell us that Heaven exists.<br />We all need to remember that at one time, the greatest minds thought that the world was flat.
1400067820|5.0|First of all, read the book. Whether you agree with Taleb or not, he has here a serious critique of serious things.<br />Be prepared for a bit of a slog - the 5 stars is for the significance of his ideas, not his literary talent. Imagine striking up a conversation at an airport bar with a very smart, slightly drunk aristocrat who grew up in a war-torn Lebanon, returning from a conference full of people he considers spoiled and irresponsible Westerners. Press record. That's how the book reads.<br />And that image in my head helped me enjoy the book. Taleb is utterly pissed off by an economic and political ruling class that he sees as oblivious to the fragility of the systems they are creating, and so to the catastrophes they are setting us all up for. The book is less a reasoned arguments than an impassioned rallying cry for people to stop drinking the cool-aid of economic and social quick fixes, attempts to overly-isolate people from the natural vicissitudes of life as well as from the consequences of their own actions. We learn and grow from the stressors of life ( up to a point), and this is how we become &#34; antifragile&#34;.<br />What I find especially refreshing is that this thesis really doesn't come across as being either liberal or conservative - Taleb isn't operating along that axis. He is arguing for us to re-value simplicity in systems, learning from and trusting our experience, taking responsibility for our actions, and being &#34;heroic&#34; in the classical sense of working for (and perhaps sacrificing oneself for) the good of others. It is a deeply traditional view, balancing the individual with society and with nature.<br />Now be warned, this all comes at you in a somewhat inebriated tirade that bounces all over the map, from the  mouths of Brooklyn bankers and (occasionally untranslated) classical writers, and illuminated by episodes from Taleb's globe-trotting life that can sometimes get a bit stale. But that's exactly how you have to hear it -the style is intentionally over-the-top and excessive, the &#34;I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore&#34; of a former economic insider.  But he has the saving graces of a sense of humor and a deep historical sense, that commands your respect more fully than just another pissed-off Fox New pr CNBC commentator with an axe to grind.

The author of this book got just the right combination of story telling, imagination, history etc. to make reading this book a memorable experience. It takes you to another world but not a frightening one; one in which you can drift happily in the author's rich brain-scape.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|This is one of very few books I have ever read that discusses the READER. Most writers are so interested in their own problems and solutions that it seems they give very little thought to their often long-suffering readers.<br />Ian McEwan is always worth reading, but I particularly liked this book because it was satisfying on many different levels. There was the history of a period I did not otherwise know, there was the variety of huge egos described, and there was a slight mystery- which was very satisfactorily solved.<br />Sometimes I feel McEwan is leading me into places I do not want to go- but in this novel I was never alarmed, and always satisfied.
B000001ELF|4.0|Of course I remember seeing this from when I was in high school but only bought it a couple months ago after reading Ace's fabulous autobiography. I wasn't sure what to expect never having been a huge Kiss fan, but this CD is completely awesome! I can't even imagine the hits they'd have had if only they let this guy sing more lead?! Paul who?? I love &#34;discoveries&#34; like this and so far it's the find of the year! I only hope Ace isn't pissed to hear this 50-year-old thinks it's an awesome treadmill iPod play!! Don't hesitate on this buy!

B009DT98RK|5.0|A lot of accolades have already been written so this will be short. Obviously if you're a fan you'll love it. For me Frampton has always just been a so so FM staple guitar player. And while he may not be considered a virtuoso player his playing here is excellent. Great show. Guys enjoying themselves on stage and playing their hearts out. Direction is good for a concert video. Not too much cut and pan. Small intimate venues. Video quality is great. HD 5.1 audio is freaking EXCELLENT!<br /><br />This is well worthy of any concert blu ray collection. And if you have a good system you're really going to want to crank it up...kick back and enjoy!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It was good entertainment but not as well done as the original or funny.  Have to say Josh Brolin did fantastic as Tommy Lee Jones character.  So believable.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|These guys are at the top in today's cliched prog rock world. They just continue to put out good quality sounding music. It's their sound. But it's new and fresh enough to keep it exciting. They have matured well over the last decade. If you like any of the previous stuff you will like this. Probably more. And though I hate the comparisons...Riverside has a very unique sound IMO...if you're a fan of PT / Steve Wilson, Rush, DT, Yes, Marillion, etc etc ...ah heck...if you're into great musicianship and rock and roll... buy this.<br /><br />This is also a very good sounding / engineered CD. About as good as it gets for 44/16. Would love to see a Hi-Rez 96/24 or better version released.<br /><br />Just stellar. Others could take some lessons.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This was well done and exciting.  Good tension between the actors and some cute moments lighten the drama. Fun evening movie.
B009O2XY12|1.0|After you play a few levels, the game locks you out if you do not want to pay for more energy.  Any game that locks you out unless you purchase more of something, is not a good game to me.  I deleted the game.

B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Just not worth the money to pay to watch it.  Slow development and flat characters.  The original was so much better.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent show! I downloaded the Christmas Special and the download process was very easy and the video was an excellent quality.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It is one of the finest sci-fi books I have read. I mean one of the at least 300 finest books I have read :)<br />It is masterfully told, characters are well developed, story is brilliant and unpredictable. Looking forward to the movie with Harrison Ford!
B00AFEXRME|2.0|What could have been about so much more than one character's study about taking responsibility and a bunch of other nice things that are entertaining to watch, if not a little petty and short-sighted--decides to take that one thing about it and ignores the rest of the moral issues going on all at once.<br /><br />Which is really odd, considering that it states something very poignant early on: Is it better that he was able to save so many lives that virtually no one else could have even due to his dependence with drugs, or does that make everyone worse off? The film never seems to catch this very resonating point, which prevents it from being more than average. Not bad, but never goes for the real dilemma in a problem that is much more than Whit's own.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I have read in a while! It takes a very unexpected turn halfway through and is not your your typical &#34;who did it?&#34; thriller. I really appreciated the two different viewpoints telling the story, very well done!

Freak who keeps walkers in his own living space. Good werk on the 3rd season. Make the rest of the season worth waiting for.
B000001FTH|4.0|Love Grace Jones! I don't like all of her music, but &#34;Pull up to the Bumper&#34; was on this cd, so thats why I got it. She kind of reminds me of David Bowie (early years) but I mostly like Graces' eccentric &#34;look&#34; (fashionwise) She has always seemed to be a &#34;non-conformist&#34;) and I guess she still is. To me she is facinating and I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes Grace Jones' music, fashions, bio, etc.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I couldn't wait to read this book, as it was on everyone's Top Ten list.  What a disappointment!  It was not the kind of book that I couldn't wait to get back to after putting it aside.  I guess I just didn't &#34;get&#34; the whole point.
B009JBZH54|4.0|If you are a fan of the trilogy created by Chris Nolan and don't want to expend too much money, this is a great deal. You get not only the three movies but also some cool additional stuff, like the documentary focused on the batmobile and a very nice -but short- book about the production's design. The combo really met my expectations.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|This is a great film; definitely one of the ten best of 2011, and I would want to see it regardless of who was in the lead role. But George Clooney's powerful performance takes this movie to a level it would not have achieved w/out him, It is his best film role ever...my opinion of course...and his Golden Globe award and Oscar nomination were well deserved. Clooney is Matt King, a Hawaiian attorney and sole trustee of a family trust that includes some 25K acres of prime Hawaiian land. He is trying to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife is involved in a tragic boating accident. She is not killed in the accident; in fact she is in a coma for most of the film....which is important to the plotline. He learns through his oldest daughter, Alex, that his wife, Elizabeth, was having an affair before her accident. He is also under pressure from the rest of the family to sell the land before the trust expires. So, Matt has a lot on his plate...a multitude of problems that would overwhelm most men. Not only does Clooney do a masterful job in portraying Matt, the young actress, Shailene Woodley, is perfectly cast as the 17 year old Alex.  The support cast is also superb. The score consists of Hawaiian music by different artists and perfectly sets the mood; and Alexander Payne masterfully puts it all together behind the camera.

B00899F0G8|5.0|My daughter wanted to watch this series, but as she watched the first show, I said I wanted to watch it too.  We have watched it from the beginning and even my 17 year old son is watching it too!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Good movie, I do not give it 5 stars only because of the streaming quality from Amazon.com. I have found that their quality is sometimes not great.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just love the series. Watched both season one and two in just a couple days.  Now on to season three.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Great to have the original CD and bonus material at 256, I could listen to Legend all day long, great summertime music.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|I must say this book was referred to me by a friend long before talk of a movie was to be out, and thankfully I took up the offer (the idea of Tom Cruise playing the same character is just crazy).<br />If you're not looking for the intense crime drama focus and like a bit of entertainment in your investigative novel, this one is probably for you! It's no Christie or Forsythe, and nor is it meant to be, with the chapters moving rapidly and the ease of reading this, you'll usually be done with a Childs book in a matter of days - which has now led me to complete most of the series of Jack Reacher novels.<br />Don't take the book too seriously and it won't be a disappointment for you.
030758836X|3.0|The writing is fantastic. She really paints a picture and the twists and turns in the story were great but I sped through this 400 page book to hopefully get to a great ending but I was so disappointed that I was actually angry I wasted my time to read it so fast. I was really mad at the ending. It's not the type of book I want to read. Especially with these characters and no redemption. It could have been so good, but it wasn't.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I bought this while it was on sale for $19.99 and I have to say I would have paid more for this one. The sound is great, and the 3D effects are some of the best. I would recommend this to anyone who has a 3Dtv.
B00422LESO|2.0|This book was okay.Easy read . It did have a surprise near the end. I haven't read about MR Darsey in so long I could not remember much about his character which this book was based on.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly has crafted a great blend of history and modern investigative reporting.  The search for the key to unlocking the mystery keeps you turning pages.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|game sucks.  it's boring and pointless. don't waste your time or money. its not even scary. I don't know who they paid to get them to rate this game 5 stars.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I love Keanu Reeves any way and coupled with Sandra Bullock made this one beautiful love story. When watching this movie don't miss any of it because it has a hook and if you miss it the movie will then become deep and hard to understand. This ones a keeper!!

B006LSZECO|5.0|A different approach to telling a story and I liked it.  The plot kept me wondering.  I was anxious to pick up the book and read some more.  Waiting for the next book and adding this author to my watch list.

B008ASGP3U|3.0|Too slow for me.  Lots of character development but not much action.  About 40% through the book and waiting for something to happen.  I never quit a book, but I've thought about it a few times with this one.

B005RUUUAI|5.0|Even if you HATE zombies or dead or scary, you will LOVE this show. It is utterly riveting to the last second of every episode! Only one warning though: It is very real feeling and made me want to prep with food storage and end of the world supplies. It is such an addicting show I stayed up for 24 hours watching it, and this is definitely out of character for me to do.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I've always been interested in stories about NDEs and when I saw Dr. Eben Alexander on TV talking about his experience, I had to buy his book. I found the description of his NDE undeniably believable. The pictures he painted in every phase of his journey were so real that I almost felt them myself and the fact that his memory of them was so clear  was astounding!<br />I truly believe that there is life after death and this book confirmed that fact for me - I only wish Dr. Alexander had gone into more detail about his recovery. I felt the ending of the book was kind of abrupt.<br />I've also purchased Dr. Moody's book to further delve into the NDE phenomenon.
B001JU4S44|3.0|it was ok.  Passed the time one afternoon.  Retread of a tried and true story.  Can't hardly miss.  I prefer finding new ideas but sometimes ya' gotta please the family, too.  :-)
B004QX07G4|5.0|I LOVE Ellen! She's one of those people that makes me laugh when she's not really doing anything - since laughter is the cure for all ills, I found her book to be highly entertaining and written exactly the way she talks. I could picture her throughout the book just sitting on her TV show couch and recounting the things that make her crazy, make her laugh and thus make me laugh!<br />If you're an Ellen lover, this is the book for you!
B00899E7VM|5.0|RTF is a great Jazz Fusion band, one of the forefathers, and this album, is no exception. Another great addition to their catalog, even though they have released another live album since their reunion. It would be nice for them to do another studio album. I know they still have some more great music in them. RTF wast the band that got me in to the whole fusion thing along with Weather Report. If you like RTF, buy this, if you're looking  to check them out, get this one, you won't be sorry.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Seriously a very good game it was original fun and interactive and a completely different set piece than cut the rope which was a nice change thank you
B0085KGHOK|5.0|With this live dvd, Slipknot prove they can pull what they do off live without seeming like a cheap immatation of themselves. The sound and picture quality makes you feel like you were there in the middle of the crowd with them. The only complaint I really have is the show itself isn't long enough. The bonus features, though interesting, but seem like they go on longer than the actual show itself. Hopefully, they will rectify this the next time they decide to do another one of these. Otherwise, I say, get this, sit back, turn it up and FARGING ENJOY!
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This was a terrific resource for me as a homeschool mom.  All the extra details about the movie were terrific.Thanks so much.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Cliche movie.  Mediocre story line, script and acting.  Craig appears unprepared to play Bond.  The movie achieved its target of International appeal and revenue, 4 times as much outside of USA as in USA, but will not be remembered as a great movie like Craig's Casino Royale.  For the next Bond movie it is time to replace Craig, write an excellent script and focus on making a great movie (Spielberg wants to direct a Bond movie).  Clive Owen and Christian Bale are all English, take better care of themselves and better actors than Craig.  Craig has made the big time financially and is no longer hungry to become a better actor.

0979019710|5.0|I bought this book for myself based on the desire to enhance my productivity. Based on the title and having the opportunity to see the author speak which left me energized and inspired, I thought it would make a great Christmas present to some of my close family and friends. Hal Elrod has simplified the basic foundational points of self-help principles and given readers a practical and actually \\"do-able\\" set of actions that will help transform all aspects of life. I love the acryonm that allows me to recall what those actions are, he calls them, \\"Life S.A.V.E.R.S \\". The Miracle Morning has and continues to shape my day, and not always necessarily is it in the morning, these actions can be tweaked for individual schedules and needs. I highly recommend all to read this book, it will enrich your life on many levels. P.S. The journal is a great addition to help put the principles in action, especially if you love to check off boxes!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is by far the best of the series in my opinion. I love how Riordan gives each character's perspective a different way of thinking. This book and series definitely deserve a Five Stars!

B0034G4OYA|3.0|Hotel Transylvania(released Sept/12)is yet another animated flick(gosh the explosion in animation these past few years!)starring the voice talents of,among others,Adam Sandler as Dracula,Andy Samberg as Jonathan/Johnny/Johnnystein,Selena Gomez as Mavis,Kevin James as Frankenstein/Frank,Fran Drescher as Eunice,Steve Buscemi as Wayne,Molly Shannon as Wanda,David Spade as Griffin the Invisible Man,Cee Lo Green as Murray,and Jon Lovitz as Quasimodo.It's an airing out,in large part for the kiddies,of the Universal monsters,all\\"dressed\\" up(animatedly)to look cutesy.However while the jokes and animation come fast and furious,overal it is just not that funny and the plot gets tiring much too quickly.<br />The Hotel Transylvania is just that,a hotel now run by Count Dracula.He opened it as a get away for monsters of all kinds,from the humans who stalk them in the outside world.He is very protective of his daughter Mavis who is coming of age,and he is super anal of his staff and hotel.His daughter,who can turn into a bat like her father,wants to make her first trip to the outside world as promised,on her 118th birthday coming up.He allows her to go but,unknown to her,he has made an artificial town,brought zombies to life as the townsfolks,and told them to be\\"aggressive\\"towards her when she arrives.The plan works and she returns home disappointed.<br />Into Dracs world comes a young teen who is backpacking through the area and stumbles onto Dracs hotel.Drac tries to hide him from the rest of the patrons(and it's a full house of monsters)because they'd be horrified to have the very thing they are trying to get away from,be there as a guest.Eventually Drac must come up with a nom de plum for him,so he dresses him up and calls him Johnny Stein.He poses as Frankies long lost cousin,and Frankie buys it.Johnny starts ingratiating himself to all the patrons who really come to like him,especially Dracs daughter.Through alot of near misses and faux pauxs,Johnny's real identity is always justhisclose to being found out.And Drac is constantly beside himself with trying to run his motel and/or trying to either get rid of,or hide,Johnny.<br />The chef of the hotel,Quasimodo,along with his buddy the Fly,come to suspect the truth and try to tell the patrons the turth about Johnny,but is stopped by Drac.However something happens during all this frenticism of Dracs.He actually comes to like him.In the end his misguided \\"duty\\"to his patrons and his over protectiveness towards Mavis,forces him to finally give Johnny the kiss off.Johnny,under duress,deliberately spurns Mavis'advances and affections,and he boards a jet back home.Mavis is in the doldrums and without Johnny there the entire hotel is in a funk.Drac sees nothing to do but to get Johnny back.He flies in daylight,continually smoldering,risking his life to get Johnny's attention on the plane.He finally does and he manipulates the plane to fly back to the airport,much to the chagrin of the passengers.The film ends as Johnny and Mavis tie the knot and start their life together,with Drac's,and the entire patrons of the hotel's,blessings.<br />The film is a kind of mixed bag throughout.Just as the jokes and plot seem to get going,the plot will either slow and/or the jokes start getting old and fall flat.There are some cute moments such as the time Drac and Mavis have a heart to heart,and Mavis,as a bat,starts pouting.It's an adorable look.It also has some neat touches such as scream cheese.But these little bon mots just aren't enough to save this film.As a result,I found it,unfortunately,a bit of a drag.Now the kids,that MAY be a different story.They may like it to a certain extent,but I kind of think even they would be squirming in their seats through parts of this film.This film to me is kind of another another Arthur(see my review on that),but just a cut above even that.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/w a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,some musical vidsand a featurette.<br />All in all not as good as I thought it might or should be.The jokes are old and the cutesy factor,as good as it was(obviously geared for the kids),could not overcome the film's basic handicap;that of an uneven storyline and the stop and go nature it created.I fall in the middle on this one;almost enough to fall below the 3 star line(but not quite),but way below a 4 star rating.and a featurette.<br />All in all not as good as I thought it might or should be.The jokes are old and the cutesy factor,as good as it was(obviously geared for the kids),could not overcome the film's basic handicap;that of an uneven storyline and the stop and go nature it created.I fall in the middle on this one;almost enough to fall below the 3 star line(but not quite),but way below a 4 star rating.

B005LAIHCM|2.0|You would have thought with all the hype and those intense trailers for The House at the end of the Street(released Sept/12),that this film was going to be a sensational horror/mystery/occult thing-a-mabob.I mean who can tell sometimes exactly what it is one sees as far as plot possibilities go in these trailers.But that is the double edged sword in this industry.If you put out some really neat trailers and stuff,you're project better be able to live up to the hype.HES,unfortunately,does NOT follow through on its promises and falls pretty flat,pretty quickly.The film by the way showcases the talents of,among others,Jennifer Lawrence(Hunger Games)as Elissa Cassidy,Max Thieriot as Ryan Jacobson,Elisabeth Shue as Sarah Cassidy,and Gil Bellows as Officer Weaver.<br />The story finds Shue,a doctor,moving into a rental home,with her daughter Lawrence,a student.Their property backs onto a forest owned by the state,and temptingly sitting on the other side of it sits another house.It is a house with a sordid history.The parents young son and daughter,four years earlier,were out playing on swings,when the daughter fell off,survived,but was left with brain damage.One night the mother heard her daughter sleep walking and when she found her in the hall she attacked her mother and killed her with a hammer.She then went into her fathers room and did the same there.Fast forward to the present and the surviving son(Thieriot)still lives in the house.Shue finds this out after making inquiries when she spotted a light on there during the night.<br />As Lawrence returns to school and starts to make new friends,one of them turns out to be Thieriot himself.He seems a quiet and unassuming boy and he is atypical of the other hunks she's meeting at school.Right off she gravitates towards him and the two get close,much to the chagrin of her school chum and mother.However Thieriot has a secret.He has his sister locked up and drugged in a room downstairs.She manages to escape now and then but Thieriot manages to tackle her and bring her back.This Thieriot keeps hidden from Lawrence and the outside world as best he can.<br />One day Thieriot asks Lawrence to come by at which time he will tell her some things she needs to know.Before they can get together Thieriot is jumped at a band concert outside,is wounded but wounds another student severely and runs home.He abandons his car which Lawrence drives home,and good thing too.For some of the other guys who jumped Thieriot are there tossing a flaming roll of toilet paper through a front window.She gets inside and stops the potential engulfing fire from spreading.However in the garbage bin she spots some women's personal products,and thinking that it is odd,she starts to roam through the house.She eventually discovers the locked room and his sister inside.Thieriot arrives at that moment and asks Lawrence not to tell anyone.As she leaves he bonks her on the head,and when she awakes she is tied up in the same room as her sister.However this is not her sister.In fact her sister died the day she fell off the swing.Thieriot has been keeping her memory alive by kidnapping and holding hostage various local girls and calling them his sisters name,for the past four years.He now wants Lawrence to be the new Carrie Ann!<br />While all this has been happening Shue has been worried about her daughter and she sends Bellows over to investigate.Thieriot kills Bellows,and later,when Shue comes a calling he stabs her also.Lawrence is in the process of escaping and a cat and mouse game ensues.Shue ends up giving Thieriot the final knock out blow,and the two escape.The smoke clears and Shue and Lawrence are leaving town.The final shot is of Thieriot in an insane asylum,remembering his mother calling and telling HIM,he was his sister Carrie -Ann!<br />There are some pertinent question I have for the writers of this shindig.If Thieriot was kidnapping various girls to act as his sister,why weren`t their disappearances ever reported.If his sister really died that day on the swing,who exactly killed their parents.And what about the title.Thieriots house was,from all intents and purposes,through the woods.I suppose there was a road leading to it somewhere but it is never portrayed/seen to be on a street or even at its end.And as soon as I heard the name Carrie,I of course went back over 20 odd years to the movie of the same name(this is the drawback of reviewing,you get deja vu over,and over again!).I also have to say this plot was just SO plodding.The first 3/4 of an hour was spent with Shue and Lawrence settling into their environs and getting to know their neighbours,fellow workers/students,etc.They introduce Thieriot slowly and his secret even slower.But when all is said and done,and despite all the musical cues and deceptive shots and red herrings in the plot,there is still really nothing scary or terribly intense about this film.I found it flopped on many,many levels.Here we have a boy who had coke addicts for parents,who blame him for his sisters death,call him Carrie,which of course sends him to the dark side of the moon and turns him into a nut job.That`s the plot in a nutshell.Old and lame stuff by any measure.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There are the theatrical and extended versions of the film included,nothing else.And nothing between either to make one any better than the other.<br />All in all a disappointment supremo.The actors did the best with what they had,but all they had was a cheesy plot artificially enhanced with the requisite haunting musical cues and usual misdirection.Nothing to see here folks!f his sister really died that day on the swing,who exactly

B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the greatest headset I've ever owned.  The sound is beautiful, the software integrates with other logitech products beautifully, and so far it's played nicely with every program I've tried it in.  As to the other complaints:<br /><br />1. This has a 10 band EQ. It's in the software, it works nicely.<br />2. The G keys are now fully programmable, and have been since I've gotten this headset. I don't know when this feature was added, or if it was this way from the start.<br />3. This will work with anything you can set a shortcut for. You may need to still set a keybind though.<br />4. Nothing about this is flimsy. It's audio equipment - like anything else, if you hit it hard enough, I'm sure it'll break. As far as headsets go, this is one of the strongest I've owned.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Volver means to return in Spanish and in this film by Pedro Almodovar people return and support each other through many troubles.  Penelope Cruz plays Raimunda, a woman with a 14 year old daughter and the head of a family of females in the wind swept region of Eastern Spain.  Raimunda and Sole her sister, both live in Madrid but go home to visit their elderly aunt and visit with her neighbor Agustina.  It occurs to Raimunda, that her aunt is living quite well with her infirmities and some help with Agustina and wonders how that could be.  The answer comes apparent to Sole at the aunt's funeral but much later to Raimunda who is consumed with a tragedy in her home.  Her drunken husband has approached their daughter in a way that has caused his death and Raimunda decides to cover up the death rather than make it public.  After several plot points the story resolves itself in the comforting, kind Almodovar way.  Like most of his films, ghosts, spirits and protective people surround a hurt person and take care of the person.  Women are often the subjects of his films and he is very kind with them, this film is no different.  It is a sweet caring film about a topic that women suffer from often and are often alone in dealing with its results.  The extras include commentary for the film is done by Almodovar and Cruz together and allows the viewer to see his insight into his film.  Interviews with Almodovar and Cruz are included as well as clips that were cut.  I found it interesting in the interview with Almodovar, that while the interviewer speaks in English, answers in Spanish but does speak in English when asked if he would work in America.  His English is very good but he prefers being the director in Spain and in Spanish since this is his culture and he has so much control over his films.  Cruz answers in English, but does struggle a bit.  Lovely film and great extras.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|I bought this for my nephew (7) and I didn't notice but its meant for older children. The instructions are very detailed so it better if an adult assembles the toy.

Great toy + quality family time, this was a great purchase.

With this great feature if you don't know a word that's in the definition of the word your already looking up just touch it and I binge up  that definition.<br />Voice recognition software.<br />Also a computerized voice will pronounce words for you.<br /><br />The only con is no picture in picture definition.<br /><br />So it a five stat free dictionary app
0736420959|5.0|I used this in my classroom for a lesson on twisted point of view and it worked beautifully. The students had to write the story from Scar's point of view and there was enough in there to complete the task.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Loved the whole CD.  Love Pat Monahan's voice,  Love Drive By and 50 Ways to Say Goodbye.  The other songs are surprisingly wonderful, too.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|It's like Howard Shore looked directly into my brain and picked out all of the parts of the Lord of the Rings soundtracks that I loved the most.  This was such a joy to listen to, and I can listen to it in two hours instead of 9 or 10 for the complete recordings... absolutely glorious.  I was a little thrown off by a few of the singers, since I'm used to the soundtrack voices... I especially missed Annie Lennox singing Into the West and Viggo Mortensen singing his little Elvish bit.  But besides that, this is absolutely amazing.  A must-have for die-hard Lord of the Rings fans!

B00005N6KG|3.0|The sound quality is great when these headphones are properly seated.  I can't get them to stay in place and I think it's because the top portion is a little too big for my head.  Might be perfect if my head was a little bigger.  Excellent sound quality for lightweight headphones!
B00028HBKM|5.0|All I can say about this video is that if your looking for a video to help people understand what Jesus has done for the sinners of this world you have found it,,This video of Jesus is the most powerful movie I believe that has ever been made,,It is in Hebrew but you can watch it without even reading the words on the screen or listening to the words and you will still know what the story is about,,You will not be able to watch this movie without shedding tears of sorrow as you watch our loving God give his son's life so that we can be forgiven.I would recommend this video to anyone,,The saved and unsaved in hopes that you will see and feel God's love.

B007XNAOS0|5.0|This album has grown into one of my favorite albums of the last 10 years. Metalheads are up in arms. Pay no attention to them. It's different than blue and red, but, it's cohesive in it's themes and plays incredibly well over time. Here's hoping that they continue to grow and take chances.
1592407889|3.0|Shirley MacLaine and Steven Parker were not the worlds first selfish, narcissistic parents. But man, they sure deserve to be included in the Hall of Fame. The incidents of abuse and abandonment are pretty grim and it is remarkable Sachi Parker retained any regard for either parent given the circumstances. This may be one of the saddest tell-all Hollywood books you will ever read, if you elect to read it. When her dad wasn't snuggling up to her in an open kimono, her mother was torturing her with some sadistic form of tough love, with her father's Machiavellain Japanese mistress hovering in the shadows.<br />This placed Ms. Parker at the periphery of her own life. She existed only in reference to the definition her monstrous parents gave her.<br />She is a winning sort, Ms. Parker, with all the pluck of a Dickens heroine.<br />And Shirley? Well, given that Ms. MacLaine has told us ad naseum about her experiences with other lives and extraterrestrials, It should come as no surprise that the crux of the book involves something of both.<br />It was a tough book to read, frankly. There is a lot of what I would call filler, the mundane stuff of a life that seems to have been on hold, waiting for some kind of permission to begin. Sachi keeps asking for things that both of her parents are incapable of offering.<br />As an aside, I would ask Ms. MacLaine, given her rather broad statement about the book's veracity, what parts are lies exactly. Did she give her daughter up at age two? Did she believe all that claptrap her husband fed her about clones and send him money every month thinking it was going to NASA? This business about lies and liars is a two-way street. She seems to have latched onto this moniker for her daughter fairly early on. Given the inherent selfishness in her abandonment of her daughter at age two, her free expression of fantasies over fact, I would say she has scant ground to stand on.<br />So caveat emptor. This is no camp joy ride of Hollywood excess and diva bromides. it is a very sad tale. I wish Ms. Parker well. I would give her two pieces of advice:<br />1) Keep acting. It gives you joy.<br />2) Walk away from Shirley MacLaine and keep walking.d diva bromides. it is a very sad tale. I wish Ms. Parker well. I would give her two pieces of advice:<br />1) Keep acting. It gives you joy.<br />2) Walk away from Shirley MacLaine and keep walking.

B008HK3XKO|4.0|I think the cover works great! My Kindle doesn't always turn on when I open the cover but I don't think it's a big deal. The covers stays where I open it so it's nice for watching videos and such.
B008D1RCI6|5.0|At least I'm not alone in my ignorance. I'm another one of those diehard music listeners --- someone who has been buying music for 40 years --- who had never heard of Bill Fay prior to this 2012 \\"comeback\\" album. I'm simply dumfounded: where was this talentd guy hiding all those years? I had planned to order this from Amazon, thinking that I'd never see it at shop in Bangkok where I live, but when I was in Kuala Lumpur recently I found this at a CD shop and bought it immediately. I still hadn't heard a single song by Bill Fay at that point, but after reading about him in MOJO magazine and in online reviews, my musical curiosity was aroused. The verdict: this is a mighty fine album. Actually, more than fine. It's hard NOT to be impressed by Bill Fay's songs. There is melody, of course, but also lyrical depth and honesty, and above all, a lot of passion. Who does he sound like? A tricky question. He's got the singer-songwriter template down, but he's not quite like Dylan or Randy Newman or anyone else exactly, but he does share those two artist's sense of songwriting excellence. He's also not just a guy sitting at his piano and singing tender songs of tragedy. There is a full band supporting him on these songs, some orchestral arrangements, and also a sense of joy to some tunes.<br /><br />Like another reviewer admiteed, I also don't have much tolerance for religion or religious references in songs, but when Bill Fay occasionaly strays into those areas in his songs, I don't find it offensive or annoying. So, if you're a non-believer like me, don't let don't let the mention of \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Lord\\" totally put you off. These songs have a lot going for them, and Bill Fay is clearly baring his soul on this album. He covers a lot of ground lyrically, so dig in and listen to what he's singing about. There's no doubt that something on here will connect with you. Now I have to go back and early those early 1970s albums he did and see if those are also as impressive. I'm betting they are.they are.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|I am having a difficult time reading this book and following the plot.  It jumps arround alot.  Difficult to understand.
0979019753|5.0|Though you don't need me to tell you if you are reading this review, The Miracle Morning Journal is meant to be paired with the book that precedes it, however it is just as effective on its own. Journals have never been something I have been serious about keeping. I'd start one then stop for various reasons, the main one being my thoughts got to be too much even for me. And who wants to reread negativity 24-7? It's exhausting. So was I. But no longer!  I confess I had my own doubts about keeping another journal after many failed attempts, but I decided to give it one more shot. And I'm glad I did. The journal is a great asset to keeping me on track with my mornings (as I am a believer in the Miracle Morning) and helps to give me focus for the day's purpose(s). All these things are outlined in the book as well as the journal, making them easy to use. It's also a great way to hold me accountable for doing my mornings. The journal is not just some book to rant into, but a tool for recording growth. I got no beef with that.<br /><br />Some people have criticized how simplistic this book and journal seem, and that that is the reason not to try it- that it's just another \\"quick-solve self-help ploy.\\" Uh huh. That's one way to go about it. Another is that sometimes the simplest things that need doing are the hardest things to do. Crazy? Yeah, I know. But true. This deal is about so much more than waking up a little earlier than normal. But don't take my word for it; make this decision for yourself. If you decide to get this journal, you might as well get the book, too, if you don't have it already. Check it out and see what happens.<br /><br />I am on my 6th week in my journal concerning my miracle mornings and I am diggin' both. I hope this review helps someone clear up any \\"misgivings.\\" I'm going to a higher level. What about you?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a lot of fun.  I like all of the ways you can make your village unique.  The only bad thing is the friend menu can be a little glitchy.
B007SGM084|5.0|This type of story is not my typical choice for reading, but many of my friends had been encouraging me to read this series, so when I had some time I decided to do just that and could barely put them down.  I am an avid reader, and there are few books that captivate me to that point, so it was quite a pleasure. This book has my recommendation to any women over 18...it might not be a bad idea for men to read it to.  Kudos to the author.  I look forward to her future writings!
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|My kids loved this as much as the other three it is very funny good for the whole family lol
B0092SPYQG|5.0|Like my title says, this is the first Papa Roach album I've owned. I bought it because I wanted some new music and I enjoy good hard rock. I was expecting a couple good songs to jam to, and I ended up with at least 8 stellar songs. This album has some great individual tracks, and as a whole it's very impressive. Every song is distinctive, thought-out, original, and fun to listen to. This is probably one of the best overall hard rock albums I've ever heard. Right after this finishing this review I'm probably gonna go check out this band's past work. These songs are very catchy and I love the guitar riffs. The production is amazing. Althogether just a very enjoyable listen from beginning to end.<br /><br />My favorite tracks: Silence Is The Enemy, Where Did The Angels Go, Breathe You In, Wish You Never Met Me<br /><br />5/5 stars. Well done Papa Roach.

B003JTHXOK|2.0|In order to create an honest review I need to let readers know that I am not generally a fan of romance. I have a few authors that I like, and there are romance novels that have stayed with me for a long time (such as The Horse Whisperer, by Nicholas Evans). For a long time, I've resisted Nicholas Sparks because I felt that he was too hyped up, too overdone, and that generally means poor writing, if not a poor story line. Generally speaking, if I enjoy an author or series, I enjoy that author or series before their body of work is especially popular. I should have known better, and will know in the future to avoid Nicholas Sparks.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this book was that the entire story could have been told in less than 150 pages. I was approximately 40% of the way through the book before it even became interesting at all. Prior to that, it was just scenes of Katie and Alex (what overly simplistic names!) doing practically nothing, alone or together. The two main characters have no real personalities of their own, so this was really quite a boring 40% of the book to read. At roughly 50% the story became more interesting with the introduction of the murderous, drunken ex-husband.<br /><br />And as weak a character as he is, he's the most well-developed character that this book has. Sparks does a reasonable job of portraying a paranoid person, and while there are reviewers who argue that the repetition is poor writing, I disagree; a paranoid individual returns to these thoughts over and over again and therefore the character development here is reasonably good. If only it wasn't just this character who got this kind of treatment.<br /><br />The only reason I can give this book two stars is because it pulled me through the ending with genuine tears, right up until Sparks ruined the book with a twist ending (which I won't spoil for the reader). While the ending was interesting, it didn't work for this particular novel, and I feel like Sparks no ruined his own book.<br /><br />I have a copy of Dear John on my Kindle and I will probably read it because I paid for it. But that is the last time that this author will get my money. Seriously: why do so many people love Nicholas Sparks so much?is own book.<br /><br />I have a copy of Dear John on my Kindle and I will probably read it because I paid for it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing if you don't read this then you are totally missing out on something amazing. You need to read this is my point clear be cause if you don't read this I will personally go and tell you how much your missing out and don't say I won't do this because I have done it before we'll of course unless you are willing to embarrass your self I would read it.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Smart sci-fi from the minds of the Wachowski brothers!  Way ahead of its time.  Having all the movies, the animated feature, and all the extras in one slim package is great, even though it doesn't come in a fancy case like the limited DVD edition.  All the content ever made for the Matrix Trilogy, in Hi-Def, in fewer discs.  What's not to love?

B00005JN0T|5.0|This is an especially interesting movie and I am very happy to have it in my collection. I have the Outer Limits collection and was thoroughly surprised to find an &#34;I Robot&#34; episode in there. I always play it just before I run this movie. Awesome.
0743486285|5.0|Nikki Sixx pulls no punches in this brutally honest book. It's taken directly from his own personal journals. But what is really awesome are the people who know him who also add their thoughts to what was going on with Nikki at the time. I have read so many rock bios and this one has to rank at the top.
0062082353|5.0|This is a biography of an amazing man and a true American Hero.  The values, work ethic and bravery told in this account are sadly disappearing from this once great land and being replaced with an ethos of apathy paired with a denial of personal responsibly and  self-reliance.  His tragic death and sacrifice in the line of duty helping those who have returned broken should never go forgotten.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|this book is a harrowing story of a child born and raised in a north korean work camp  . it tells of his life growing up and the horror he endures. his escape from camp 14 is a miracle. this book grips you right from the beginning and holds you until the end.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not the usual Jack Reacher. It's more Tom Cruise and less of the usual Lee Childs' Reacher that we've come to know. Although, it's not a bad story about Sorenson and Delfuenso; are these a distraction?

B00136JQMI|5.0|This is the quintessential jazz album for anyone to own.  Miles Davis was a musical genius and presents great standards with incredible solos.  I would recommend for jazz trumpeters to find transcriptions of his solos and really dig them apart to get inside Davis' improvisational mind.  Awesome album whether you're big into jazz or not!
B006IDG2T6|3.0|In this book, very interesting experimental data about the neuroscience of our choices are shown, which leads us to a philosophical discussion about free will. Tough very interesting, Sam Harris seems not been able to see that it obvious that even if some entity that has  a property X ( X being free will in this case) can be decomposed in more fundamental entities that do not possesses X as a property, this does not means automatically that X was an ilusion.  In general, in those cases X is called an emergent property, for example, are life, temperature, pressure, etc, none of them fundamental, but all of them useful. Harris is careful enough to define free will in a way that limited enough for the validity of his arguments, but he really never dismiss free will as an emergent, instead of fundamental, property of our thinking.
0547884591|5.0|This book is a must have in physical form. I am sure the e book is great but i feel that a ton of work was put into the ascetics and presentation that must be held. It has almost made me late for work twice as i have a hard time putting it down.

I don't buy a lot of cookbooks because honestly, Cook's Illustrated is all I really need.  But I LOVE this blog... so I wanted this book. It was backordered over Xmas so I just got my copy a couple of weeks ago and immediately had to make the first recipe I opened to.  DElicious.  This cookbook does not disappoint - the instructions are very clear and very practical, so that even very fancy-looking dishes are within reach.  She has a really nice narrative style and did I mention DELICIOUS?  Big thumbs up on this book.
B005LAII0I|5.0|For a while now, I have enjoyed the TV show &#34;Pit Boss&#34;, because of that I was drawn to this version of Snow White. It has a unique twist from the basic story that I remember from when I was a kid.

0307341550|4.0|This was my first book by Gillian Flynn and it definitely won't be my last. I wanted to try something different from what I normally read and I rather enjoyed this haunting thriller with it's ugly range of disturbed characters as second-rate reporter Camille Preacker is reluctantly sent back to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri. Dealing with her own suffocating demons that landed her briefly in a psych hospital, she is forced to face her demons head on as she entangles herself in the poisonous web of Wind Gap inhabitants, investigating the gruesome murders of two preteen girls from tight-lipped authorities and families of the victims; all the while unearthing chilling discoveries of her younger sister Marian's death, previously, as shocking new revelations intermingle with these more recent killings---hitting a little too close to home.
0316044695|5.0|An excellent book. Not a happy story but it really depicts the struggles our special forces have in fighting the terrorist regimes. After reading this book I was more appreciative of all the many missions successful and unsuccessful our men and women in uniform perform that are not necessarily captivated in the news. Which is a good thing. The less we know the less the enemy knows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its amazing its worth it by farr i am so glad I got it if you haven't gotten it you haven't lived Its amazing
0439023491|4.0|This book was not as good as the previous books. It was slow in the beginning. I wonder why it is so popular among children. Sort of a scary thought. Placing children in battle for their lives. It does explain what a cue is.
0765325950|5.0|I truly loved this wrap-up to the series. Sure, I didn't get as much of one or two of my favorite characters as I would've wanted, but there were so many people and events to cover, so I think Sanderson was actually very thorough. I read through it much quicker than I should have because now it's over! But I honestly loved it. One of the best sci-fi/fantasy series I've ever read. Reaching this end makes me want to start all over again.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is a totally fun, loving look at Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice'. A young woman, who is fed up with modern life, finds herself living her dream as a character in her favorite Austen novel. Her modern sensibilities and a prescient knowledge of the plot  line, leads to one complication after another. The dialog is very witty, and I think Austen would not have taken umbrage with this version. The acting is first rate, and Austen's plot and  language is plumbed to its comic depths. I first saw this on Netflix, and had to own a copy after two more viewings. I have recommended this to all my friends.

1451695195|1.0|I hope for the sake of people around Dr. Alexander that this book was ghostwritten because it's beyond patronizing.<br /><br />Secondly, ONE THIRD of the book is the appendices, and index.<br /><br />Finally, if you are reading this book for some deeper answers about what he saw and experienced while out there, you will not find that here. While a few chapters cover his NDE, they reveal surprisingly little. This book really should have been just a long article.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was interesting, but more for teenagers than adults. It is a far fetched story & got more interesting as the story unfolded, but the grotesque beings that showed up near the ending were a little  too &#34;Harry Potter&#34;  for me.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book can give people the hope to come out of their addictions. I relate to it in many ways and can thank God that I never got that far. Great story wether your an addict or not
030758836X|3.0|This book was good, but I didn't find it as enthralling as I thought I was going to. The characters are oddly constructed and in many ways, well, horrible people. And it's hard to like horrible people, but not impossible. So, with that in mind, I'm not going to write an incredibly long summary--if you want that, then there are plenty of reviews that do that for you--but this book was worth a read, and,  if nothing else, its paperback price tag.
0393345084|5.0|Krugman is one of those rare individuals who is scathingly brilliant but can write clear prose. This book lays out a clear, logical explanation of what happened in 2008, speculates on why it happened, and most importantly, presents detailed prescriptions for moving forward.<br /><br />The geniuses in Washington DC won't read this or listen to him because, as Upton Sinclair noted, \\"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\\" And lobbyists and the one percent themselves have direct access to our legislators.<br /><br />A number of young people (I work with young people) and older people who do not have business knowledge have asked me why we had this recession and what we should be doing about it. I always refer them to this book (or give them a copy). It's a quick and clear read.<br /><br />For background reading, I also recommend Krugman's [[ASIN:B004J8HXGS The Conscience of a Liberal]] ... He really deserved that Nobel Prize.
0345803485|3.0|This will not be a negative review. The book, as a whole, wasn't a bad story. It was interesting, it had good moments, and had semi-likable characters. The one thing that I couldn't get past, though, was the repetition of phrases and the overuse of the word \\"delicious.\\" And it's not that I'm trying to be incredibly picky. Seriously, everything was delicious. She was delicious. He was delicious. The food was delicious. The sex was delicious. The pain was delicious. The wall color was delicious. I was waiting to be told what wasn't delicious. Also, the book could be a bit childish. One could tell the story was originally written around the story of a teenage character, in this case Twilight's Isabella Swan, but I still think it was a far cry from most fan fiction. There was a real story in this book and, if nothing else, it'll get your blood flowing.<br /><br />This is, of course, just my opinion. I know plenty of people who loved this book, and, overall, it was okay.

0062183591|5.0|Dan Ariely has once again educated the public. The public<br />hates to learn. Instead of learning they cheated on tests<br />that eventually got them out of school.<br /><br />And who else cheats?<br /><br />You? Me?<br /><br />Everyone.<br /><br />Not me...ok I found an exception in the book.<br /><br />The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is an important book.<br /><br />The fact is that Dan doesn't lay into those who are dishonest by<br />throwing stones. Instead he points out in a very, \\"this<br />is human behavior\\" fashion that doesn't make it OK but<br />doesn't send you to the confessional when you are done.<br /><br />What surprised me in the book was Ariely's discussion<br />of ego depletion and temptation and having that in a book<br />about honesty and dishonesty.<br /><br />I'm not so certain that using up self regulation units as<br />the day goes on and then eating brownies falls into a<br />category of cheating or dishonesty. It certainly does<br />show that people are complex creatures made up of many<br />conflicting \\"parts\\" that don't make for a black and white<br />world.<br /><br />The discussion about counterfeit products was interesting.<br />I had never considered how knock off jeans or purses<br />might seriously impact the reputation of the brands themselves.<br />I'd always considered these kinds of counterfeits as<br />stealing from the company but hadn't considered the<br />brand aspects.<br /><br />A growing body of research has shown that wearing knock<br />offs does indeed cause people to cheat at other things as well.<br />Now that's very interesting. That principle alone is worth<br />the price of ten of the books.<br /><br />Ariely's latest is one of those books that every<br />teen, parent, salesperson, business owner should read.<br />It reveals a great deal about who we are as people. The book<br />makes us more aware and less judgmental.<br /><br />What I'd like to see Dan research is this: For people<br />who have read this book in say a one week period, how<br />does THEIR honesty and self regulation compare to those<br />who have not read the book. I believe this would be<br />an interesting study.<br /><br />Here's my prediction. You tell me what you think. I suspect<br />reading about dishonesty without all the pain attached<br />probably uses up self regulation all by itself. I suspect<br />reading this book just might make us more dishonest in<br />certain areas of life.<br /><br />Beyond that it's a book that virtually everyone can<br />gather insights from even if they've seen the research<br />before.<br /><br />Ariely always awakens without offending. He's a rare<br />author and  a more rare human being.in say a one week period, how<br />does THEIR honesty and self regulation compare to those<br />who have not read the book.
