B004GJYROG|5.0|At first i was a little hesitant to buy this movie because it was such an old movie and it was for a cheap price. The dvd came in four days before they said it was going to come in. It was still wrapped in original plastic and had been untouched i have now bought 2 dvds and looking to buy some more you wont regret buying them. You will want to keep buying more from Importcds

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was but a 'tween when The Godfather, Part I was released.  Underaged, I begged my parents to take me to what would have been my first experience with an R-rated movie.  I was told to wait a few years.  Being the precocious and good girl that I was, I waited until I was \\"old enough\\" to watch the movie; however, I did not wait to get my hands on the novel, Mario Puzo's greatest and most famous work to date.  Even at a tender young age, I loved the book.  My parents, of course, had no idea I was reading the book!  Finally saw Parts I & II following my high school graduation and have been a fan of both movies ever since.  Like most Hollywood classics, they never get old.  That said, I was not at all thrilled with Part III.  But no matter as I am getting all 3 movies (and then some) for the Deal of the Day price of $25.00 (not to mention free shipping).  In blu-ray format, this set is not offered anywhere else for this low price.  I checked!  Way to go, Amazon!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This  wonderful movie is about a married couple named Leo and Paige  (Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams) who get a in a car accIdent trying to get pregnant.  Paige wakes up in the hospital with memory loss and not rembering Leo her husband.  After being released from the hospital Paige goes and lives with Leo to see if that helps with her memory loss.  At one point Paige goes and lives with her parents.  Leo helps Paige to remember their life together.  I saw this movie today February 20, 2012.  Go see this movie at the movie theatre.  I loved this movie.  I recommend  this movie. I hope everyone who sees this movie  loves it as much as I did.

B005VPRGB0|5.0|Great little set!  At first, I thought that 199 pieces would be a bit small (I have 6 pieces left over after building the quad bike, with the rest presumably for the alternate model), but I was pleasantly surprised at how this build turned out.  The kit has great proportions, functionality and realism, and it uses a variety of unique pieces for being such a small set.  Good color choices and contrasts among the various pieces as well (the black tires on black rims also look great, as orange and black work good together).  The finished quad reminds me of a KTM four-wheeler (I am very fond of KTM dirt bikes, so this kit is even more awesome to me in that regard).  Great set, would definitely recommend!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This TV show is about five men named Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki)  Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) and Raj Koothrappail (Kunal Nayyar) who are physicists at the University Cal Tech.

1583334386|5.0|All too often we divide the world into the \\"haves and the have nots\\" - there are those that have willpower, and there are those who do not. Willpower is all about character, morals, and a stoic position through life.. or maybe not? \\"The Willpower Instinct\\" humanizes this trait by pointing out that it is as much a physiological response as any other behavior. Willpower is resource, which can be depleted, replenished, and nurtured. The trick is to recognize when and how to do all of the above: how do you deal with situations that may tempt you, which situations or behaviors tempt you, and what are some simple strategies for getting the upper hand?<br /><br />Kelly McGonigal does a great job of providing practical lessons and advice that you can put to use in your everyday life, as well as provide the research and the background to explain the physiology. For example, simple tricks like changing your challenge from \\"I will\\" to \\"I won't\\", or even a simple tactic of \\"defer it for 10 minutes, see if its still as appealing\\" can do wonders to your ability for \\"self control\\". Great read, with practical and useful advice.

B005NFJAZS|4.0|The musical was as wonderful as I remember, but the film had too much of a red hue to it.  I know that trying to save these wonderful movies from the original film is not the easiest thing to do because of the way the films have started to decay, and I applaud all of the efforts that are being made to rescue every film possible.  It didn't make everyone look like they were filming in hell...just that they all had bad cases of Rosacia.  The quality of the soundtrack was perfect.  It brought back a lot of fond memories of the first time I saw this when I was a little girl.

0743289692|5.0|This is an excellent book, both in writing and in the story told. I was naive enough to think that these kinds of things were not common events within my lifetime, and that Islam and Muslims condoned (or even supported) this kind of thinking and behavior. But then I read this book and the Princess Sultana trilogy, and had my eyes opened. I sure lost a lot of respect for the religion and the agressive proponents of it after doing this reading. Thanks to the author for telling her story.
1250006341|4.0|This is a great look behind the scenes of the show, as well as into the life and times of the real people in houses similar to Downton.

B0057R5XRG|3.0|On release this was a fantastic set and justifiably so. Years later the warts are easier to see. The biggest issue to me is the role of the children. Too prominent, too stupid and in many scenes they should not have been there at all. Having said that some of the adults were not too smart either and these days it is not unreasonable to expect a more balanced story line. The dinosaurs were smart but the story line is really too weak for repeat viewing. I rate this as 5 star for kids but only three for adults.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|This is a movie about people whose experience with death (their own or others') transforms them.  So in a sense it's a story about rebirth--but the rebirths are not at all what anyone expects.  There are three stories, in three locations, and they eventually converge.  In Paris, Marie LeLay has her world exploded by her drowning and resuscitation in a tsunami.  She can't stop thinking about her time in death, and it affects, and eventually destroys, her work, and her (apparently rich) life as a news interviewer and correspondent.  In London, one of an indissoluble set of twins is killed, leaving the remaining brother hopeless and familyless (his mother leaves at the same time).  In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon), tries to begin a new life after years of heartbreaking work as a psychic connecting others to their dead loved ones.  (Lonegan himself got his \\"gift\\"--which he regards as a curse--after dying several times on the operating table as a child.)  But this life, too, shatters, when he reluctantly performs one last reading for a woman he meets in his Italian cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard).  She is unnerved by his ability to see her childhood abuse, and she flees, and shortly after George is let go from his escapist factory job.  With his severance money--job, hobby, and potential girlfriend gone--George decides to follow his love of Dickens to London.  (I knew I would love this movie when I heard George listening to a recording of David Copperfield--one mention of Peggoty, and I was hooked.)  Naturally, he runs into the bereaved twin boy, and also the French correspondent, who has written a book called \\"Hereafter\\" about her death-experience, and is at a London book fair.  In some ways, the movie is like a Dickens novel--preposterous coincidences and shameless tugs on the heart.  But that is all to the good, because it is genuinely moving and thought-provoking.  All the characters develop, but not at all in ways that they, or we, can predict.

1451627289|5.0|What would you do if you could go back in time and change history? That is the premise of this book where a guy by the name of Jake Epping gets to do just that. With his knowledge of the past and the things he could do to change the future, the question becomes \\"do I change history and what will happen if I do\\". In true Stephen King style, and with great detail, Stephen King provides us with a \\"what might have happened\\" had JFK NOT been slain.  Worth every page, and worth your time to read it....really makes you think of life and fate.
B006ON41FC|5.0|he is 8 yrs old and made me say that.  he told me that when the squirrel bumps into a tree it makes him laugh.  we always look forward to getting the free app of the day and he immediately had fun with this game.  as much as he enjoys this I would have been willing to pay the $.99 for it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I played this app frequently until the last update.  I have looked for a paid version in the past when the ads were only for their other games and far less annoying. I even downloaded their other two apps in hopes that the ads would turn off.  However, following the last update, the ads got far more annoying ... but still no paid ad-free option. :-( Will probably uninstall because I HATE ads on my phone that much.  I'm completely sympathetic to the developers' need to make a living, but without an ad-free version I will probably (unhappily) uninstall.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game and play it forever... I like to see what different nuts you become and I like how there are missions!
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I enjoyed Maggie Stiefvater's \\"Shiver\\" - the lyrical prose was deftly done (although as a few reviewers have noted she at times chose to stretch a little further and it could be hit or miss, depending on one's tastes).  I do think as others have noted that the story seemed a little too light in some ways.  It can be hard to strike a balance when faced with the demands of young-adult stories, which tend to be shorter in length (85,000 words or so is common) with shorter chapters and a faster pace.  I sensed an ability toward richer descriptions which unfortunately was kept in check in deference toward pace and length.  The story itself held a few weaknesses which the prose could mostly overlook - others have noted some weaknesses with parents who seem entirely too absent (such that they don't realize the main character has a boy living with her and sleeping in her room each night), hospital settings that don't feel quite true to life, and attitudes toward wolves that have attacked humans or are making too many encroachments into human areas (like school parking lots and backyards) that would have been quickly addressed based on similar such human-wildlife interactions that occur in real life.  Also the cold-warm shift from wolf-to-human which is too reliant upon the wolves making never sufficiently convincing choices to remain in Minnesota.  A fantasy story - including contemporary/urban fantasy - has a little leeway in stretching belief.  It's part of the package.  And although belief was stretched a little thin in a variety of places, what works with this book tends to overcome those weaknesses.  The prose is often a joy to read, the story's pacing moves well and the relationship between the characters feels genuine even if some have noted that it moved at a rather accelerated pace (but then, so do all relationships in books, movies, and other entertainment).  The characters aren't deeply developed due to space constraints but are sufficiently fleshed out that theybehave and interact in ways that feel genuine.  All in all, it's an enjoyable read.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|THE GREATEST! Showed at a church dinner adults and teens loved! Worthwhile purchase and looking forward to my next movie.
B000FCK65W|5.0|As is stated in this book's forward, this story isn't about one thing. There isn't one topic, one climax, one point. It meanders quietly, yet poignantly through the growing up years of a young girl living in the poverty stricken tenements of 1912 Brooklyn, NY. To describe the plot is impossible if one wants to do it justice. There's just too much that would have to be left out and that that would be a shame. Suffice it to say it keeps one's attention to the elimination of everything else.  Upon research, I found it is actually an autobiography of the author (which makes it even more moving and unforgettable) who, upon request turned it into a story. I also learned while it became a huge best-seller when originally published in 1942, it was also hugely controversial. People didn't want to see poverty and injustice, reality in their stories. Looking in that mirror could be just too uncomfortable. Honesty is fine - up to a point - but truth is sometimes awfully hard to stomach. Taking from the book:  \\" Honesty is casting bright light on your own experience; truth is casting it on the experiences of all\\"  And, that's what Ms. Smith did so well. In her story we see bits of ourselves, for good or bad. We relate to the too-skinny girl who doesn't fit in. We remember the cruel children, the harsh teachers, the humiliating situations that coat the human experience. We also remember the joys that make childhood magical, the dreams that make growing up an adventure, no matter one's social class. Francie's life is filled with life - humanities. It's a story of living among the desperately poor through the eyes of one who knows nothing else. But, lest one think it is depressing and dark, it's also a story of love, of family, of the infallible will to do better in a country where better is always promised but sometimes disappoints. It's innocence shines through even while its hideousness is obvious. It is a quiet, heart-wrenching, soul-felt, yet ultimately hopeful story. It accepts weakness but inspires greatness. It admits ugliness while searching for beauty. It acknowledges great despair while encouraging great hope. All with a clear, simple voice of an 11 year old girl
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I didn't like it. it took forever to load and told me I had no connection when all the bars were full.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Atmospheric tale.<br /><br />Curtis is a solid hardworking husband and father who is suddenly having frightening realistic dreams of destruction, mayhem and seeming doom - always preceded by various forms of water or viscous substances.<br /><br />Like his mother, a paranoid schizophrenic, is he also losing his grip on reality? Are his dreams and visions intersecting with fears about himself or it is a portent of something more ominous?<br /><br />This production presents us with a stark and plain realism. There aren't any beautiful people, no cute women and handsome men - everyone and everything is average. A true slice of life set on a gray, but beautifully simple stage. I was impressed by all the artists who performed their roles to perfection; but in particular, engaging lead actor Michael Shannon who completely envelops the ulcerating madness of a man on the edge.<br /><br />In my view, Director Jeff Nichols cleverly took the Story of Noah and repackaged it to and for a modern audience. It's almost a literal translation as I understand the tale. Most interestingly though - Curtis is guided to go underground, not float above it. And the most terrifying aspect of that: If Noah was granted a vision of a great flood of water covering the Earth, and Curtis sees monstrous storms - all things being equal - what kind of storm would the world be facing?<br /><br />Yikes.<br /><br />Quiet edged production that sounds like a razor moving across a mirror - an almost imperceptible tone that's the harbinger of undefined and terrifying danger.<br /><br />Very remniscent of films like 'Frailty' and 'Knowing'.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workouts for at home, especially when you don't have a lot of time. I saw results in the first 10 days!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very entertaining ride through a dystopic horror of a world.  I'm going to try to be vague so as not to ruin the plot, but I'm compelled to characterize this story as one of planned conservation and forced enlightenment in a world built by the politics of the insane and maintained by the necessity of the mad.  The author's carefully crafted plot and seamless writing powered me through a twisting knot of a tale that left me gasping.  I found myself so immersed in the story that I would respond aloud to the latest turn and have to answer the question of \\"What ARE you reading?\\" again and again.  I've seldom read a story where an author can so fiendishly violate some common conventions of traditional storytelling while effortlessly enhancing character development and plot by doing so. Because of this, I've come to the conclusion that this author is an evil bastard, and I love him for it.  I WANT to see this movie, or better yet, as a long, long serial.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Finally, the perfect app. this app is fun and totally awesome. it us cool.for ages and not too easy but not too hard.

B006ON41FC|4.0|very fun game ,there are little challenges to do within the game and that keeps it fresh. the game is repetative in the fact that you have to start over at the beginning every time you hit a tree and I don't like that.
B004V2AWKG|3.0|The Giver was a pretty decent book, it managed to create pretty good imagery and insight as to what could go wrong in a controlled society. Though the book drags on a bit and doesn't provide too many interesting details the ending is left far too open to be considered satisfying. This book would be better aimed toward younger children of middle school level.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|the UV copy actually isn't as bad as everyone is says all you need to do is download the app from the app store and after you redeem the code you can watch it from your phone or ipod. they say it exactly in the FAQs on their website. I was going to contact them for the iTunes code someone else suggested but than I looked at the FAQs and saw how to get it onto my android device.
B006LEHOL2|4.0|I have remained a Sinead O'Connor fan these decades, though the best of her work in at least the past ten years has been as a guest artist on other projects.  Still, I dutifully purchase each new Sinead album and usually find at least a couple tracks to embrace.  My expectations are low, and I certainly didn't have high ones for How About I Be Me.  Have a look at the cover.  In a career of really, really ugly album covers, she easily hits a new low with this one.  No one is more surprised then myself when I report how much I LOVE this album!  This is her best since I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, and perhaps her most consistently \\"good\\" album ever.  Her genre/covers albums have been good for what they are, but never as inspired as her original albums.  I always felt Universal Mother a bit of hit-and-miss; Faith And Courage had some strong songs, but even those were buried in horrible pop production and resting among a songbag of clunkers; Theology had some inspired lyrics, and you could feel the passion in the project, but the religious subject matter and hymn-like qualities of most of the songs keep it out of heavy rotation on my headphones.  How About I Be Me is simply a very good album - there is not a single song I want to skip, and I honestly can't say that about any one of her previous efforts.  This may not be a masterpiece, but it is a classic.  In exchange, I cannot say that there is any one song that strikes exactly the same chord as my favorites from her past - Jerusalem, Fire on Babylon, Troy, Mandinka.  Oh, but \\"Take Off Your Shoes,\\" \\"I Had a Baby,\\" and \\"Queen of Denmark\\" are very VERY close - the last is a cover, and I've never heard a cover that sounded more like it was written by or for the singer.  These are classic Sinead songs.  Honestly, tears came to my eyes on the first listen.  I never expected to hear her voice doing these things again.  She uses the power and passion of her voice in a way she hasn't in years.  In fact, her voice sounds better than it did on her past two albums - proof that is isn't age but lack of TLC that's been holding it back a bit (I cringe to think of her ganja-smoked croak on Throw Down Your Arms).  The material fits at home with her earlier stuff, but is never imitative.  I hate when an artist tries to recapture their glory days by putting out a calculated simulation of their hey-day.  These songs are of today.  But they are simply as naked and sincere as her early work, which is why they are excellent.  Some of them are even quite happy, celebratory, silly.  In these songs, the lyrics are frustratingly weak at times, but if you've followed her work as closely as I have, you know Sinead has a penchant for disappointingly simple lyrics when she's happy about something.  Still, musically, they are the catchiest songs on the album - \\"Old Lady,\\" \\"4th and Vine,\\" and \\"The Wolf is Getting Married.\\"  That last song I'll single out is \\"Back Where You Belong,\\" a reworking of a contribution she made to the \\"Water Horse\\" soundtrack a couple years ago.  While the film version was absolutely beautiful, hushed, and painful, this version is a strident war song, reinvented as an anthem of sorts.  I've never heard a song so dramatically reinterpreted yet equally beautiful and effective.  It's a high point in her career.  Simply put, this is the album she should have released in the mid-90's.  It's a progression, not a rehash, and it's everything a Sinead fan could desire at this stage in her career.  These tracks were written between 2007-2009, so I'm just hoping and hoping that she hasn't slowed down in the last three years.  Who knows, there may be another great album just waiting to be recorded!

I'm so sad it's over but at the same time I'm relieved I can come back to this reality so I can get back to work....NOT!  This trilogy is so so good - 99% Perfect (and that is very very very rare).  The only thing that I would have changed, reduced or deleted is the farcical redundant exhibitions of Ana's inner goddess (& sometime subconscious) which sent my inner bee-ah-tch screaming, \\"No more ice skating, ballet or gymnastics references - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!\\"  in my head.  But other than that it was perfect :-) and on my top 5 best reads ever.

0330352288|5.0|I have enjoyed Ken follett for hs epic stories, second to none, like the pillars of the earth or the recent century series. Triple is very different, but for the quality of the story telling. It is a classic international spy thriller, like many others around, but with the special follett touch: deep characters, complex human interactions and a well researched background. This is a page turner of great quality. Highly recommended.

B007B8GI28|3.0|Not 5 stars unless you lead a really boring life, or you are financially connected to the show. If this is 5 stars then the rating system must end at 10. Not the best and not the worst of the series, as it just ok.<br /><br />I think the show should be renamed. Here's some options: \\"The Talking Dead\\" \\"Young and the Restless Dead\\" \\"General Dead Hospital\\" [I mean really they have more surgeries taking place .... The patient list is higher than the zombie kill count. Sick girl in bed with unknown disease; Gunshot wounds; Torn ligaments from impalement. Car accidents victim due to sheer stupidity, so a brain concussion looks like she's ok as there was no brain to hurt. ]<br /><br />Can the women be any dumber!? They are illogical and irrational based on sheer emotion. Where's Ripley when you need her? \\"Did IQ's suddenly drop since I've been away?\\"<br /><br />Let the zombies eat the writers and get some new ones. That would be a 5 star show.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|I purchased this cover almost 2 months ago. I waited to write a review to be sure I checked it out completely first. First let me mention that, yes, when you first recieve it and attached your Fire to it, it does not close all the way. This lasted only a week or so for me, and I stored the fire upside down to help with getting it to close all the way.  Now almost 6 weeks later, it closes by itself. It is pretty worn in, but that is mainly because I am on my fire all day every day. It hasnt torn or stretched out and I can assure you that I have put a beating to it.  It is not real leather, but to me that doesn't matter.  My Fire fits snuggly inside, with no stretching of the bands as of yet. I see this cover lasting me a long time, hopefully the life of the Fire.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|My baby was 9 pounds at birth and 12 pounds at time of purchase but her lil feet hardly hold newborn size anything on them, she's 2+ months now.  These play socks stay on perfectly with just the right amount of tightness so she can work at actually being rewarded with pulling them off eventually once she masters that skill...however in the mean time they stay on her extra small feet perfectly all through our play session and boy does she love these...they really get her excited...especially the crinkly butterfly one...so don't buy these if baby has larger feet than newborn size because these fit a baby smaller than that but they do have a small bit of leeway so I say newborn or smaller foot size these are perfect, otherwise go to babies r us you can find some with more of a stretchy material...these are not at all stretchy so they will either fit or they won't...I love them.  Ty Ty.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This book was really cute and I enjoyed it. I don't think it was personally worth how much I paid though. S. Kinsella's book \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" is still my favorite by her. This wasn't was funny as I was hoping but it still had me smiling in certain scenes.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is definitely the best app I've ever gotten as the \\"free app of the day.\\"  The quest is entertaining, and I like the fact that the tile set changes as you go through the different civilizations. It kept me on my toes; just as I was getting used to the tile set, I had to learn another one.  I also really like the artifacts you can collect by performing tasks within the game.  Only a couple of things I don't like: the comic cut-scenes are often confusing and unclear. The comics are not very well done. Also, the endless mode is exhausting and time-consuming. I'd love to get the artifact for completing 100 levels in endless mode, but I calculated that it would have taken me about four hours. Maybe I'm a slow player...?
B005ZHB84U|5.0|I knew when I saw the film that I would buy the soundtrack.  This score relies very heavily on ethnic instruments and Hans Zimmer also gives us some enjoyable bows to the theme from \\"Two Mules for Sister Sarah\\" which plays to one of the funnier parts of this rather dark film, as well as some appropriate excerpts from \\"Don Giovanni\\" by Mozart.  The Mozart score is woven into a stage production of the opera which appears in the film, but it is written in such a way that the entire sequence becomes memorable, both musically and visually.<br /><br />Along with some other standards woven into the historical aspect of the score, gypsy and regional themes abound.  The musicians not only seem to be enjoying themselves, they are incredibly talented with some musicianship you have to hear to believe.  Maestro Zimmer and his recordists really capture the presence of the musicians so we really feel we are part of the performance.<br /><br />The quality of this recording is just as electrifying as the content.  The CD creates a huge, deep soundstange that extends well past the speakers and really fills the room.  Instruments are crisp and one instrument can be distingushed from another.  As a contrast, the soundtrack from \\"Warhorse\\" is dull and constrained, develops a small soundstage that exists only between the speakers, and has difficulty distinguishing individual instruments.  I really commend the producers of \\"Game of Shadows\\" for creating an auditory experiece that is up to the quality of the scoring and performace.<br /><br />This is a CD that really stands on its own as something you want to hear again and again.

B005HSG3TC|3.0|Pros:  Really compact. Stands nicely w/o having to open the case  Cons:  Flimsy. Doesnt look/feel like quality material. The threads in the strap started coming off on mine.  This is minor thing which probably won't bother you much, the lid didn't come all the way through when closed. There was around 1-2 mm gap near the edge.  Overall, it is nice, but it didn't feel like a $30 product. 20-25 would probably be a good price for it.

B005URRCUY|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've bought in a long time. I know The Black Key's older work and yes, this album is a lot different than their earlier ones, but I think it's better.  But this is more of the kind of rock I like. I like faster pace, keyboards, harmonys, etc.  Also, I'm the same age as the band members and I happen to write songs for fun.  The music I created when I was in my early 20's was waaaay different than the music I write now.  People grow, and especially grow a LOT from their early 20's to their 30's.  I think people need to give these guys a break.  They have exceptional talent and write some world-class music.  Dan's voice has an amazing sound quality to it and he is one of my favorite singers.  Many claim this album is another victim of the loudness war, but I don't really hear it, at least not as bad as on other albums I've bought the last few years.

B005TZFZ9W|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can just let run from start to finish,repeat, start to finish, then repeat another few times.  It's Tyga & very little YMCMB joining in just like I like it.  I think Nikki shows up in one track, Wayne is in another, but most of the album is Tyga, & the guy flows smoothly, & I like the beats, & hooks.  If you like Tyga, I say get it.  I don't expect anything enlightening from YMCMB, or most hip hop.  I have been a hip hop fan since the beginning & alot of this stuff out today is junk, most of which I listen to just for the production values, beats or to give my subs a workout so I don't look for grammy material, in most of it.  It is what it is.  The album follows the usual pattern from most hip hop & if you have heard Tyga you know what to expect.  He doesn't stray from his usual delivery or material in Careless World...

0743437497|5.0|I'm probably speaking in cliche (heck, I KNOW I am) but like a bottle of wine, age only seems to add to the greatness of Stephen King's classics. \\"The Shining\\" may be bordering on vintage status (it celebrates it's 35th anniversary this year) but as far as I'm concerned, its plot, characters, and over all feel make it one of my top favorites of King.  And I'm not saying that lightly, especially when I have read pretty much all of King's works up until the early 90's \\"The Dark Half\\" (excluding \\"The Dark Tower\\" series). Seriously, \\"The Shining\\" may have only been King's 3rd published book, but it was penned at the true peak of his talent. Proceeded by the dark \\"`Salem's Lot\\" and followed by the sprawling epic \\"The Stand\\", this novel fits in between 2 of the most celebrated works of modern day horror.  Like the previously mentioned \\"`Salem's Lot\\", there's that creepy-crawly sensation you get while engrossed in this story. It's not cheap, shock fiction, but an honest-to-goodness feeling of something evil and violent. Not since the perennial classic \\"It\\", have I been wrapped up in a story so dark and disturbing. It's neither scary nor exactly frightening, but the isolation and despair you feel for the hapless Torrance family is very rarely emulated in past and present works of horror.  Thanks in large part to the Stanley Kubrick adaption of this book, the story will be forever timeless. The film does well to capture Jack's spiraling madness and possession of the spirits that haunt the Overlook hotel, but the book and film might as well be 2 separate entities. King's novel (the original) is a far better, far more mature work. A hedge maze in the film replaces the original moving topiary animals, the nude woman in room 217 makes an appearance in both but, as is always the case in novels, she is far more menacing and sinister. Even the hotel itself is a much more violent, beastly character in words than it is on the film reel.  Sometimes I wonder how some novels an become such hits (James Patterson anyone?) and other times I can easily see why a book becomes a staple of American fiction. \\"The Shining\\" is one of those kinds of novels. It is thoroughly enticing, and perhaps one of the most accessible of King's library. It is mature and moves at a speed that propels you to an \\"explosive\\" (Cosmopolitan's word, not mine) conclusion. There's terror, suspense, love, action, violence, courage, as well as many strong attributes printed on these pages. It is legitimately an outstanding tale.

B0072GPQ72|4.0|\\"War Horse\\" is an epic film that has a grand scale and sweeping colorful horizons and golden skylines, reminding me instantly of the way movies of the 40s were shot, most particularly \\"Gone with the Wind\\". It has an old movie feel to it, and that, to me, was maybe its most shining attribute. Movies like \\"War Horse\\" don't exist anymore, so maybe that is why director Steven Spielberg chose to remind us of why maybe they should and why we miss them so much.<br /><br />While there are large scale, World War I battle scenes, \\"War Horse\\" proves what truly has power of influence over movie audiences; heart, personality and relationship to characters (and horses) that we empathize with. Steven Spielberg isn't one of Hollywood's greatest director's for no reason. He knows, and has known for years that you can destroy things, make scenes rapid and exciting and full of spectacle, but if the audience doesn't have feelings for the characters, it is all for nothing.<br /><br />The movie begins with the birth of a foal in a field with a young Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) watching on. From that moment on, Albert has found his love in life, a horse he later names Joey. The movie then follows the life of Joey as he changes hands, is given different names and experiences the joys and hardships of life. It is a fair comparison to the same ups and downs that humans experience. Joey is loved by Albert and a young girl named Emilie (newcomer Celine Buckens), but also faces terrible hardships as he dealt back and forth between soldiers at war.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is at times a little overdone in the emotional category. In the later parts of the movie, it seems Joey is treated with some soft of respect that comes out of nowhere with people who haven't been privy to the journey the horse has taken. The reaction to the `miracle' horse is more for the audience then realistic as men drop everything their doing to come to the aid of one horse in the middle of a grand war.<br /><br />That being said, the movie works if you don't think too much about it. \\"War Horse\\" works mostly for me just because Spielberg brought back some of the beauty of old style filmmaking, with bright horizons, dramatic dialogue and sweeping music that made you feel nostalgic, even though you were watching a movie made right now, in the 21st century.think too much about it. \\"War Horse\\" works mostly for me just because Spielberg brought back some of the beauty of old style filmmaking, with bright horizons, dramatic dialogue and sweeping music that made you feel nostalgic, even though you were watching a movie made right now, in the 21st century.

B004LWZWBU|3.0|This movie is not really comedic, unless you are laughing at the irony of what's going on in it (people dropping their life savings to travel all over the US for 365 days to see birds). I don't hate the concept, and the cast was likeable, but it did miss the mark for me. I had high hopes since the rest of the reviews on here were high, but it is not a 4 or 5 star movie. It's a 3 star movie, one that you probably won't love but won't hate spending a couple hours of your time on. Don't go into this looking for a ton of laughs, there are actually some pretty  dramatic moments (like when Bostick keeps leaving his wife). Steve Martin was probably the best part, and Jack Black was fun too.

0439023513|5.0|The end of this brutal trilogy wasn't only a shocker of a read, but a devastator on all fronts. At the start, it did seem like a rough read. Namely, how Katniss wasn't sure she could trust the Rebels even though they rescued her from the Capitol. Things just couldn't seem to add up, no matter the situation. Then things got better. And worse. Better, quality-wise and in the storytelling weay. Worse for the emotions and how it went for Katniss.<br />The last book I read that dealt with the mechanics and workings of propoganda was Tim Downs' Head Game, so it's no wonder I was reminded of it here and there, yet it's very different as well.<br />Finding out what makes Katniss tick, figuring out what she can't do. Using what can be known about her for the use of propoganda against the Capitol. Then the reverse- the Capitol using propoganda as well. I ended up feeling like I was being a ping-pong ball along with Katniss, trying to figure out the truth, even when I though I did know it.<br />Then the deaths. The deaths are just as brutal and unforgetable (even when you wish you could forget them) as in Hunger Games, and find out truly devastating secrets about certain people. Some were just jaw-dropping compared to others, but, when you thought back to key moments in Catching Fire, they'd make sense.<br />In the end, you realize just how much life was structured into those deadly Games. Even though some characters' deaths were nothing short breath-stealing and devastating, and the closing was very solemn, it did present the possibility of hope in the end.

1933633867|5.0|If one were to take our cultural language at face value, it would seem as if money itself is a force of nature.  When we discuss the behavior of money and financial markets, we speak of money as something that \\"happens to us.\\"  Banks, state regulatory agencies, and credit agencies, in our imaginations, are much like meteorologists.  They are the interpreters of natural phenomena.  We rely on them even more than we do our weather men!<br /><br />If money works according to the laws of nature, then debt is the force at work that the laws describe.  Anthropologist David Graeber argues exactly this in \\"Debt:  The First 5,000 Years,\\" that the story of money is the story of debt as it has changed through the ages and differed across different societies.  Unlike our common conception though, Graeber convincingly argues that money is anything except a force of nature.  Money has served as a means of measuring honor, collecting taxes, and facilitating exchange between nations.  Sometimes, it has existed as coinage, but often, it only exists as fictional numbers in a ledger.  However, it is anything but natural, and the ways in which money and debt have operated in various cultural epochs never transcend the culture's ethical outlook or its class structure.  More importantly, the debt that money is meant to represent, more often than not, is defined in ways that intentionally privilege a certain social class, or institution within that culture.<br /><br />Graeber's thesis can be explained in purely social-scientific terms, but he also doesn't hesitate to wear his more modern-oriented political intentions on his sleeves.<br /> \\"Even if we are at the beginning of the turn of a very long historical cycle, it's still largely up to us to determine how it's going to turn out... Capitalism has transformed the world in many ways that are clearly irreversible.  What I have been trying to do in this book is not so much to propose a vision of what, precisely, the next age will be like, but to throw open perspectives, enlarge our sense of possibilities, to begin to ask what it would mean to start thinking on a breadth and with a grandeur appropriate to the times.\\" - pg 383<br /><br />In pursuing his thesis, Graeber means to challenge the way in which the reader conceptualizes the role debt plays in modern times, and to suggest that debt is perhaps one of the greatest destroyers of human happiness in history.  Graeber clearly sees the problem of debt as an issue of revolutionary world-significance, and intends to help the reader understand this as well.<br /><br />Graeber initiates the more academic meat of this book by stressing to the reader just how deep debt runs in human civilization.  Modern humans use the language of debt to describe ethics, social contracts, familial relationships, and virtually anything else that can be illustrated with language.  Like the fish that is unaware that it's swimming in water, we are so accustomed to this sort of cultural experience that we are usually incapable of noticing it.  Unlike the fish's water though, our debt-culture is not \\"natural.\\"  We created it ourselves without realizing it.<br /><br />The book from this point onwards progresses as if a detective story.  If human beings really are creatures of \\"barter and trade,\\" as Adam Smith claimed, then this should be reflected in the story of human culture.  However, it isn't.  The mythical stories of primitive bartering societies we find in economics textbooks are simply incorrect.  Graeber describes the cultural characteristics of a wide variety of agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies, both in the historical and anthropological record, that completely defy the traditional capitalist imagining of human nature.  Societies use hierarchies, egalitarian distribution, and a wide array of social formations to distribute resources and settle conflicts.  Actually bartering within such societies is usually detested- it's seen as a sign of insincerity and moral impurity.  Bartering is observable in some of these societies, but is relatively uncommon, and is usually conducted with foreigners.<br /><br />Graeber continues down the eras of human history to show that debt and money evolved in response to specific political events and varied according to the host culture.  However, there are two common threads found in ancient European, Indian, Middle Eastern, and Chinese civilizations.  Armies were usually involved in the creation of monetary systems, and the taxes kings imposed that were meant to provide for them were what actually created the first \\"markets.\\"  Taxes are not parasitic upon markets, but rather, taxes make markets necessary by forcing the common people into market behavior.  The other major contributor was slavery.  Chattel slavery marked an event in various civilizations where the stripping of a person's dignity created value.  Suddenly, human beings had a worth as commodities.  In turn, the rise of slave societies were followed by a rise in the commodification of other areas of human life, from female sexuality to social status.  Armies created markets, and slavery allowed monetary debt-culture to seep into the most intimate areas of human life.<br /><br />The cultural epochs and twists and turns that Graeber documents are massive in scope.  To inadequately summarize his body of evidence, Graeber notes that once one looks closely at the history of debt, the connection between monetary debt and morality becomes questionable, to say the least.  The most common use for debt has been for the political torture of the citizenry, and as an excuse for rulers to control the most minute details of their subjects' lives.  Debt has always been closely tied to militarism, and the conjunction of debt and militarism, without fail, leads to the ruin of the societies who partake of both.<br /><br />\\"Debt\\" culminates with the birth of capitalism around the 16th century.  Many 18th and 19th century writers, including Karl Marx, identified the birth of capitalism with the birth of free wage labor.  Although Graeber sees wage labor as an inherent property of capitalism, it is actually the sophisticated European banking system, which was the first financial system in human history to fully dedicate itself towards the unending accumulation of value, which birthed capitalism.  The invention of capitalism was truly a top-down event, and to an even greater degree than many left-wing critics have previously thought.  The debt peonage, use of finance as a means to militarization, and debt as a form of political control all characterize capitalism at its earliest historical stage.  Many defenders of capitalism try to claim that finance capitalism is the illegitimate bastard child of \\"real,\\" down-to-earth manufacturing capitalism.  Graeber demonstrates that the reverse is true:  The Henry Fords of the world are the bastards of Wall Street, and not the other way around.<br /><br />In the last few pages, Graeber restates what he interprets as the political implications of his study.  Billions of people worldwide are suffering because of the debt-burdens that financial crises continually create, and it becomes obvious that debt is, in truth, more of a social weapon than it is a matter of personal morality.  Graeber provides some basic statistics to demonstrate that America's astronomical levels of household debt cannot possibly be a matter of personal moral responsibility, and that the true culprit is clearly the system itself, once one looks at it with an honest view.<br /><br />As a whole, this book is a superb exploration of its subject matter, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone.  Graeber deploys a wide variety of theoretical tools from the anthropology profession, while keepings everything within the realm of the layman's vocabulary.  He is always sure to stress the practical relevance of the subject at hand, while also helping the reader to understand the almost incomprehensible depth where debt runs through our way of daily thinking.  In the process, many things modern readers assume to be true about human culture are proven false, while many fascinating continuities between the debt-struggles of ancient societies and our own modern political problems are established.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what \\"tradition\\" Graeber is writing in here.  He appears to be borrowing from Marxist, post-structuralist, and pragmatist anthropological thought.  At the same time, he appears to hold the same position as Karl Polyani in regards to the interdependency between economics and culture.  For this reason, I'd recommend that readers who enjoyed this book should read [[ASIN:0848817117 The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time]] by Polyani.

B002KSPKRS|2.0|I ordered this headset last week for use with my Xbox 360, and used it throughout the long weekend.<br /><br />Mic Quality: Excellent.  I came through loud and clear for each friend that I tested the headset with.<br /><br />Comfort: Good.  The ear cups are a little small, but they still fit over my ears (barely) and were comfortable for using several hours at a time, at least.  The headset is tight enough to not fall off easily, but didn't cause any discomfort (even with glasses on).<br /><br />Sound Quality: Great, when not crackling or popping.  Unfortunately this model is very susceptible to interference from other wireless devices.  Between the 360 controllers, my wireless router and other sets of headsets in the house (not to mention anything the up and downstairs neighbors have going on), these were unusable for watching a movie with and nearly so while gaming.  Lots of snap, crackle and popping, as well as sound cutting in and out briefly.<br /><br />Overall I can't recommend these to anyone, unless you will be using them in a location that has almost no wireless devices in use.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have no complaints about the shipping of the product. I absolutely love the Twilight series, and this movie is my favorite out of all of them. I do however, recommend reading the books first. The books are mesmerizing and filled with suspense.
B000PC6A3E|4.0|I don't want to start a \\"who plays the best Batman\\" argument going with this review. That is not the case here. Let me be clear that for the first time ever in movie format, the writers for Batman Begins FINALLY got Bruce Wayne's parents murder correct. I know that sounds strange, but it means a lot if you are a Batman fan. It was not the Joker or Harvey Dent who fueled Bruce becoming the Dark Knight. It was a thief... how hard was that to get right?  Aside from that, this origin story is believable with the present day setting and almost to the point of \\"wow, this could actually happen.\\" The best part of this film is the minimal use of CGI. Of course the bats, parts of the train, and some of Gotham was CGI integrated, but still very believable looking. The Bat-mobile or Tumbler tank was a real treat to see. the amazing notion is that it actually exists and you couldn't help yourself with saying \\"I want one!\\"<br /><br />Another plus is there is an awesome amount of A-list actors and actresses in this film. All are wonderful performance with making a Batman story come to life scene after scene. The only problem I had with the movie were some new character additions like Rachel Dawes as a main character. But Katy Holmes performance was good so I immediately didn't mind her being in it. I know that people particularly Batman fans and non fans alike questioned the voice Christan Bale used. I just wish people would understand why. Unlike George Clooney's (gags self) or Michael Keaton's performances, you wouldn't talk in your normal voice if trying to hide your real identity and invoking fear into thugs. You want to mask your voice and sound intimidating. It did get questionable in The Dark Knight sequel, but I just wish people would get over this stupid hump. Watch the bonus features for the making of Batman Begins and watch Christian Bale perform. You will understand why he was chosen to be Batman.<br /><br />The influences from various comic book source material is apparent. Most of the ideas like the famous bat swarm scene is from Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Year One mini series. Anyway, Batman Begins is worth a Blu-Ray price for 720 to 1080p resolution and High Definition surround sound. It's a must own for Batman or action movie fans.deas like the famous bat swarm scene is from Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Year One mini series.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|Plays great on kindle fire. Definitely recommend for hours of fun. Safe for kids to enjoy too. A few different levels increases the fun. Easy to understand how to play, teaches you right in the game
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Please note that I did in fact grow up with watching and loving the Tim Burton Batman movies. After atrocities called Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, I convinced myself the only good Batman stories will either be animated or in comic books. In my opinion, the best Batman in visual format is the Animated Series from the 1990s. Kevin Conroy will always be the true voice of the Batman, and Mark Hamil will and always be the Joker.  However, for a theatrical and more realistic view of the Legend of the Dark Knight, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />I would write a long review of why I think my title sums it up, but I'll just go by the stars:<br />1 star for being the amazing Christopher Nolan directed sequel of my favorite comic book superhero.<br />1 star for the amazing performances of all of the actors and actresses. Yes even the Christian Bale growl I liked. What? you have to mask your voice! Shush! He's Batman! grrrr! Heath Ledger will forever be remembered as this Joker. More so than Jack Nicholson (oh no the blasphemy oh!)If the Joker was to exist, this has got to be it. I couldn't take my eyes off of him watching this at the theater.<br />1 star for how this was made. Barley any CGI. This movie was just created so freaking well.<br />1 star that this is what a Blu-Ray disc is all about: 720 and 1080p resolution High Definition Sound quality.<br />1 star for.. I'm not sure, it's a very #$%@ing great suspenseful action movie.<br /><br />I would pay whatever price for this movie if I don't already have it. Well, not a Best Buy or Barnes 'n Noble new release price, but $19.99 or $9.99 totally worth owning one of the best Batman and Blu-Ray releases ever!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great animation. Lots of puzzle types that'll keep you entertained for a long while.  Power tiles are fun, but sometimes confusing as they're not consistent over maps.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Easy to play once you've gone through the tutorial.  Scan the board to figure out which non matching tiles will go together and work your way through the quests.  Totally addictive fun!
B006UG90RM|5.0|as a huge classic van halen fan (read: anything with roth - not hagar), i wasn't about to let them off the hook on this one.  as one who is always sceptical of reunions, i expected/demanded something that was on par with their classic albums (the first through 1984). to me, why do it if they're going to phone it in? it would only diminish their legacy and be a waste of their time (and their fan's time).  when i heard the first single \\"tattoo\\" a couple of weeks before the album was released, i have to say that i was not impressed. still, i knew that it could be misleading as singles are often my least favorite songs. generally, the singles are chosen to appeal the lowest common denominator. no new news on that front.  i picked up a different kind of truth the day it was released (first one out of the box!). i took it home, popped it, and was absolutely floored. this album is not only on part with the classic albums, it is an extension. it is  classic van halen, but also is a contemporary, modern take on it. i would go as far as to say that they outdid themselves on this one. the album is full of fire, passion, inspiration, and great songwriting and playing - all trademarks of the classic VH. still, it doesn't sound like a parody of itself. like i said, it is modern take on CVH.  the biggest surprise would have to go to edward van halen himself. i don't think i've ever heard him sound better or more inspired. much is made of original bassist michael anthony not being a part of it, but wolfgang is just as good (if not better) on the bass, and he does a great job handling the high vocal harmonies that were/are michael anthony's strong suit. alex van halen is in top form as well.  and then there's diamond dave, who will not dissapoint those of us taken by his wit, sense of humor, and exhuberance. still, the only critique i have would probably go to dave.  there are moments where it seems as though he is trying a little to hard to be the singer's singer, as if he has something to prove to those who have said that he is not as good of a vocalist as hagar. what roth may not realise is that we love him just the way he is, and that his singing, phrasing, and what not is perfect for the band and has always been one of it's most appealing factors.  the album begins with \\"tattoo,\\" easily the most radio-friendly tune on the album (thus, the first single), and just takes off into the stratosphere from there. in fact, after hearing the song in context with the entire album, i have grown to like \\"tattoo.\\" the rest of the album is chock full of super-charged rock and roll (not one ballad on the record, and very little keyboards) done CVH style.  i could dissect each song, but what's the point. music, like all art, is a subjective thing. it would be better to just fork out the $$ and decide for yourself. about the only thing i will add is that if you are a CVH fan, it is money well spent, and i can't imagine too many people being dissapointed with this album.  thanks to ed, alex, dave, and wolfgang - you pulled it off!
1423136802|5.0|I bought these books for my 8 year old son, and in under 2 weeks he had all five of them read. He could not put them down! I quizzed him with each book to make sure he was comprehending what he read, and he could tell me, almost verbatim what happened. He is 8 years old and in the third grade, these books are a little above his reading level and he still enjoyed them immensely. I would recommend these to any parent looking to both encourage their kids to read and help them to learn Greek Mythology as Rick Riordan sticks pretty close to true greek mythology.
B0054N73EY|3.0|The first RHCP record with Josh Klinghoffer \\"I'm With You\\"<br />There is not one guitar solo here that sticks WITH YOU.<br />Josh does put some interesting notes in here and there.<br />Flea And Chad sound solid. Anthony is in classic Anthony mode, with great words and vocal melodys.<br />You can hear John's influence on Josh's playing on some of the songs.<br />This is kind of step forward for everybody, and and a few back.<br />I didn't expect Josh to fill John's shoes the first record after he left. I mean how do you follow up Stadium?!<br />I think the next record will be a lot better.

B004HW7JMO|4.0|Spartacus second season is not as good as the first one, but is still very entertaining, if you enjoy as I do this sort of overcharged pulp. The first season brilliantly ended with Spartacus and his fellow gladiators rising up and massacring their master Batiatus and escaping to become fugitives. The illness of star Andy Whitfield (regrettably, he ended up dying of cancer soon after) changed the plans of the producers, and instead of making a regular second season following Spartacus exploits as a rebel leader, they choose a short six episode prequel. The action takes place some years before Spartacus arrival in town, and we see how the upcoming Batiatus rises up to become the top lanista in Capua, against his main rival in the gladiator business, the very evil Tullius (Stephen Lovatt, who is great). To achieve this, he will rely, among others, on his top gladiator, Gannicus (Dustin Clare), originally bought to Tullius at a bargain price, as well as in Crixus and the trainer Oenomaus (the last two, seen in the first season).  If Batiatus seemed quite a mean man in the first season, here we see him fight against an even meaner man, Tullius, so we sort of end up sympathizing with him. For something that for obvious reasons was rushed into production, the script is rather good. As with the first season, Gods of the Arena is full of graphic violence and sex filmed with relish. A problem with the second season, in my opinion, is that Gannicus is not as an interesting character as Spartacus (we don't have much of a background story on him), so the focus of the season is on Batiatus, and actor John Hannah does not disappoint. While the machinations between the two masters are great, what is lacking is something as interesting in the sand.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a fantastic game.  I  love it.  One the best on Android.  So addicting.  Definitely a keeper.  Works with LG Optimus V.  I would not have spent money to buy it,  but it is entertaining and well worth the money.  Thanks to the developers and Amazon.

B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore call it curtains on their marriage because of Moore's fidelity. The movie then becomes about Carrell trying to make a sense about the breakup and his single life. He is befriended by a young mentor ( Ryan Gosling) who is determined to teach him a thing or two about becoming a ladies man. In a way, this film could have been very cliched but it survives on the chemistry of the two leads, Gosling and Carrell. Emma Stone and Julianne Moore are okay and Kevin Bacon along with Marisa Tomei are great as well.<br />Formulaic but great actors make the film watchable. four stars 1/15/2012
B006ON41FC|5.0|Awesome, I just cant put it down!! I love collecting nuts and working towards accomplishing goals. A must have, especially on a tablet.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|The original Planet of the Apes movie was path-breaking but I was never a fan of the series, I watched the Tim Burton reboot a few years ago, still unswayed. Skeptically I ventured to see the unbelievably hyped summer movie named Rise of the Planet of the Apes and to my astonishment, treated to a great story replete with stunning actions and storyline.<br />The story as it is told is supposedly a prequel to the original planets as to how the apes came to escape and rule the world once populated by humans but set in present day.<br />A young scientist takes home a ape named Caesar after his mother dies and the lab at which he works at decides to kill all the apes that they are testing on in order to find a cure for Alzheimer's. They form a close bond, but tragedy strikes and Caesar and Franco are forced to part ways. While in captivity, Caesar starts rebelling and comes to despise the ways of the human ( there are actually many events leading to this) eventually culminating in a action packed finale atop the Golden Bridge in San Fransisco, when the apes manage a relentless assault against the humans.<br />Incredible and exciting are words which spring to my mind, this film delivers on action, entertainment and emotion. James Franco is like able as the doctor. But it is Caesar the ape, emoted by Andy Serkis that is the heart of the film. Believe the hype, this is a great film..five stars.
B0018PH3L0|1.0|We loved the movie, but be careful buying used CDs - there were scratches and after watching for 6 hours, we almost didn't get to see the end.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|A cross between documentary and drama, Contagion is a film about a global pandemic. The story line is plausible, this event could very well happen and is populated by big  name actors. A virus threatens to destroy a large fraction of humanity, and the first victim is Gwyneth Paltrow who transports the virus to Minnesota from Hongkong via Chicago. Her husband Matt Damon is unaffected by the deadly virus but it devours her young son. Kate Winslet,Lawrence Fishburne and Marion Cotillard are doctors trying to figure out the origins of the virus but little is revealed about their backgrounds. Exciting and terrifying. Four stars.
B000BCE918|5.0|Was sent as promised, in great shape. Nicely done.<br />Hope you have the movies I'm looking for on the future.<br />Great collection & nicely packaged, fast service.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Action films could also be boring as directors often rely only on CGI and stunts to entertain. MI4 is different, not only does it great action and stunts but a story line as well.<br /><br />Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) gets away from the Moscow prison by the IMF, Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) for another mission' -  to break in to the Kremlin and steal files related to a person called `Cobalt' (Michael Nyqvist). But things go wrong,as Kremlin gets bombed and IMF is accused of doing it. The US govt initiates a `ghost protocol' (no protection) against them and thus they become rogue agents. They not only have to prove their innocence but also prevent a nuclear war.<br />This was a long film but the pace does not lag at any time because of the brisk direction and action.<br />I thought the following scenes were amazing.<br />1. The jail break in Moscow.<br />2. Dubai episode atop the Burj Khalifa, the worlds tallest building- jaw dropping and spectacular, this sequence is worth the price of the ticket.<br />3. The sand storm car chase.<br />4. The sequence in the Kremlin.<br />Brad Bird brings the same effortless direction he showed in the Incredibles to MI4. Tom Cruise is brilliant and supposedly did the stunts without a double, this guy must be almost 50.<br />Exciting and well worth your time. Five stars. 12/27/2011
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Sierra Hotel! Chris has created an excellent account of \\"many days in the life\\" of a modern combat Special Ops soldier in the extremely difficult and deadly environment of Iraq. Chris' accomplishments with a sniper rifle are unmatched in their own right but he shares the brave exploits of those around him, something you won't find on CNN. For veterans of Iraq like myself it pays tribute to comrades lost in action and shares a side of the emotions of what it's like to be there better than anything else I have read so far. Highly recommended.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I enjoyed watching all the seasons of Lost. They were full of great storylines and meaning. I thought the ending to the series was the best way they could have ended it.
0439023521|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time, I really wish that people would not compare good books with dribble, I believe Harry Potter was a good series, Lord of the Rings, these should never be placed in the same sentence as this series, which was un-entertaining, un-believable, un-enticing, un-likable and perhaps worst of all boring, if you want to be entertained reread Harry Potter, go read Terry Pratchett's Guards Guards, almost anything else but this.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|This album has some very different sounds for Fun on it. Some people who are very married to Fun's sound from their debut album \\"Aim and Ignite\\" may take some adjusting to a few of the tracks on this album. They experimented with a more electronic sound on a few tracks and some auto-tuning. But when you really listen to the tracks, the things that people love about Fun and what makes them so special are still there. Catchy pop hooks combined with some of the most poignant and compelling lyrics ever written. Songs such as \\"Some Nights\\" \\"Carry On\\" could move mountains. The lyrics are simple yet perfect. Pure poetry  In the end, Fun has produced (much like The Format before them) another album that is the kind of record where your skip button starts to feel highly neglected, and can't be turned off. What is a 5 star album if not that?
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is easy to understand. Play is smooth and quick. I like the automatic placement by just tapping the screen.

B002BWP49C|5.0|Having read all the novels and seeing no conflict in how a novel gets translated on the silver screen, this is the best one yet.  I totally have \\"envy\\" for the people who paid the $50 for the super cool extras like the poster etc.  I also recognize what \\"teases\\" the movie producers are, cutting Part I exactly at the right time for maximum suspense.

0385344228|5.0|Last summer I was in a bookstore in Mobile, Alabama and when I paid for my purchases the owner asked if I would like to select an Advance Readers Copy.  It seems the store gives them away after they have been read.  I asked for a recommendation and after telling him what I was interested in, he handed me Defending Jacob.<br />Homerun.<br />For reasons that escape and frustrate me, I'd not yet read anything by William Landay but that is now a thing of the past.  (As an aside, I plan on reading his entire catalog and I'd suggest you do the same.)<br />Landay is a master storyteller with a gift for characters, pacing and dialogue.<br />Defending Jacob opens with a former senior assistant district attorney, Andy Barber, being examined before the grand jury.<br />We soon learn that in the sleepy bedroom community outside of Boston where professionals come to raise their families a heinous murder has taken place.  A young boy was murdered.  Murdered in the same neighborhood where Barber lives.  The murdered boy was the same age and in the same class as Barber's son.<br />And it doesn't take long to learn that Barber's son, Jacob, has been arrested for the murder.<br />The plot builds towards Jacob's trial but Landay, as he moves us forward, fills in the past while working to bring the reader forward to the grand jury and the testimony being given by Barber.<br />Oh what surprises await us along the way.<br />The plot unfolds in the most pristine of fashions.  As you turn each page you'll have to remind yourself to breath as you wait for the suspense that you find has embraced you to relax its hold so you can recover for the next chapter.<br />Driven by amazingly complex characters, great dialogue and a razor sharp plot that simply won't stop, my best counsel would be to run, not walk to the nearest bookstore and reserve your copy today.<br />I read and write legal thrillers and pride myself on being able to, if not solve the mystery, at least know where things are going.  In Defending Jacob, I felt like an amateur sleuth trying to find the door to 221B Baker Street.<br />The book will literally have you guessing until the final page.<br />If you like classic courtroom dramas, this is the book for you.  It is paced well and would make a great beach read or vacation book.sleuth trying to find the door to 221B Baker Street.  The book will literally have you guessing until the final page.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This item came right quick. Was suprised and very satisfied. I couldn't wait to get it out of the envelope. I used this first on an old jackknife given to me by my grandfather. Got it sharp as the day I got it. Darn good little tool!
B000TGCR4C|5.0|If you are only aware of director Paul Verhoeven's work on bloody sci-fi epics like \\"Robocop,\\" \\"Total Recall,\\" and \\"Starship Troopers' or his lap-dance fiasco \\"Showgirls,\\" then you should check out this WW II suspense drama supposedly based on a true story.  This tale of a young Jewish woman who through various circumstances joins the Underground in occupied Holland and winds up as the girlfriend of the local Gestapo chief is wildly suspenseful with numerous twists and turns.  But one of the main areas of enjoyment is the radiant lead actress, Carice van Houten.  She is so beautiful and such a wonderful actress that you cannot take your eyes off of her.  You can really understand how the Nazi Gestapo chief would become so smitten and give up everything for her.  The film is spoken in Dutch with English subtitles although there are some segments in English.  The cast is mainly Dutch and German actors.  The only actor I recognized was Derek de Lint, as the Underground chief, who during the 1990s starred in the Showtime horror series \\"Poltergeist-the Legacy.\\"  As stated the plot takes many twists and turns and there is a lot of action and machine-gunning of both Nazis and Dutch Underground fighters before the film comes to its very satisfying conclusion.  I enjoyed this film greatly, it is one of my favorite Verhoeven films.  And as stated previously, Carice van Houten is an absolute pleasure to watch.  If you want an interesting and engrossing WW II suspense drama, this is it.  The only real special feature is a documentary, in Dutch with subtitles, on the making of this terrific film.  Picture and sound on the blu-ray are fine.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This was the free app of the day so I thought I'd at least try it out. I ended up playing it for like four hours, it's ridiculously good. I liked the variety, the visuals were nice on my Xoom, and it worked very well. Very glad I grabbed this one.
0316010669|5.0|I was initially drawn toward Blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking, by Malcolm Gladwell, because of my interest in how people think, and why we choose to believe certain things or take certain actions. The subtitle leapt out at me, filling me with high expectations for Gladwell's book. Thankfully, Gladwell exceeded these expectations with his developed thesis and absorbing writing style. In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explains how to predict the quality of a relationship in just a few minutes, how George Sorros made his billions, how to read a person's face, why speed dating is successful, and many other topics you'll wonder why you never wondered about. Blink is rightfully a \\"#1 National Bestseller,\\" as stated on the cover.    Gladwell begins by explaining that our unconscious mind often helps us make decisions (called \\"thin-slicing,\\" \\"snap judging\\" or \\"mind reading\\"). However, we often misuse our intuition by stereotyping unknowingly, so we should make a deliberate effort to not judge by appearances. Then, Gladwell states that if we overanalyze a situation, we will probably make the wrong decision. We can improve \\"mind reading\\" with practice, as expert psychologists and food critics have done. Then, in the afterword, Gladwell tells us that his main purpose is to reduce racism and prejudice, whether it is unconscious or conscious.    Gladwell masterfully adds layer upon layer to his thesis throughout each chapter. Each chapter contributed a new idea to the main idea, while staying on track, and not branching out into seemingly random topics, as some of his other books do, specifically What the Dog Saw. Gladwell proves his point with personal experiences, stories, statistics, and even a test that you can take online ([...])! I also appreciated Gladwell's straightforward writing style, which was especially helpful when explaining how people think - a very complicated topic!    For me, the chapter that was the most attention-grabbing, and was the most aptly connected to all of Gladwell's points, was Chapter 6, titled \\"Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading.\\" In Chapter 6, Gladwell vividly describes a shooting in the Bronx, in which the police, using intuition based on stereotypes, shot Amadou Diallo, because they assumed he was going to shoot them. Because of incorrect snap judgments, these police officers presupposed that Diallo, who was standing idly outside, was a burglar. They assumed that he had a gun, that he was pulling it out, and that he was going to shoot them, when, in fact, Diallo was just getting his wallet from his pocket, because he thought the officers would stop bothering him if they saw his ID. This tragic story demonstrates the pitfalls of amateur thin-slicing. Additionally, Chapter 6 was my favorite chapter because it allowed Gladwell's captivating writing style to shine. I found myself absorbed by Gladwell's play-by-play of the seven seconds that determined life or death for Amadou Diallo. This chapter encapsulated Gladwell's \\"real lesson of Blink: It is not enough simply to explore the hidden recesses of our unconscious. Once we all know about how the mind works- and about the strengths and weaknesses of human judgment- it is our responsibility to act.\\"    Although, overall, I rated Blink as a five-star book, I felt that Gladwell could have shortened some of his stories. His constant summaries were very helpful, but they were excessive. (I find it odd that Gladwell first wrote Blink, and over-summarized, and then wrote What the Dog Saw, and couldn't manage to stay on the topic he said he would talk about.)    Overall, I immensely enjoyed reading Blink, because it was a stimulating, smooth read. Gladwell successfully supported his thesis: we make split-second decisions, which we should ensure are well-made. In an interview with Malcolm Gladwell, he sums up Blink by saying we should pay attention to \\"the smallest components of our everyday lives...when we meet a new person or have tomake a decision under conditions of stress. I think it's time we paid more attention to those fleeting moments. I think that if we did, it would change the way wars are fought...the way couples are counseled...and on and on. And if you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world.\\"

B006LEHOL2|5.0|As famous as she's been over the past 25 years for her incredible voice and confessional songwriting, Sinead has also made a name for herself by using the world stage as a therapist's couch. Some folks are content to resolve their dilemmas in private, but Sinead has acted them out all-too publicly.  If you didn't know her music, you could easily dismiss Sinead as a publicity-grabbing nut with a big ego. But in point of fact, she's an artist of breathtaking power and originality, as demonstrated by HOW ABOUT I BE ME AND YOU BE YOU. There's too much wisdom, insight and humor in these new songs for me to disparage her character or focus on her extra-musical activities for very long.  HOW ABOUT I BE ME is an astonishing record -- honest, heartbreaking, scathing, hilarious and ultimately deeply compassionate.  Its songs explores various facets of sexual and romantic obsession and delusion, drug addiction, hypocrisy and other &#34;lightweight&#34; topics that Sinead is famous for.  Sinead has great lyrical command of vernacular, spoken language as well as uncanny psychological insight. The stories she tells throb with irony, profanity and pathos.  Using the first person, Sinead serves up her characters' ambivalent and messy lives for our consideration. They teeter between out-of-control desires, false hope and self-denial on one side, and guilty self-reproach and painful awareness on the other. There's the thoroughly untrustworthy junkie (&#34;Reason with Me&#34;), who admits to stealing your T.V. but then reveals a darker truth:  &#34;I don't like no one around me/ `Cause if I loved someone, I might lose someone&#34;; the unwed mother who grapples with shame and guilt while recalling the exciting sexual encounter with the father (&#34;I Had A Baby&#34;), and the pining woman who knows her infatuation with a married man is &#34;uncool&#34; but insists that they'll be together in the future (&#34;Old Lady&#34;). In the smashing opener, &#34;4th & Vine,&#34; the narrator isa starry-eyed woman getting dressed for her wedding.  Utilizing every cliché in the pop lexicon, plus some lovely unexpected phrases too, she sings &#34;I'm gonna marry my love, and we'll be happy for all time.&#34; The irony is implicit, but there's so much optimism in the delivery that it's impossible not to root for her impossible dream.  In a different vein, nobody can rant like Sinead, and on several tracks (&#34;Take Off Your Shoes,&#34; &#34;Queen of Denmark&#34; and &#34;V.I.P.&#34;) she takes us down her dark road of righteous rage, directed towards herself and others.  In her cover of John Grant's &#34;Queen of Denmark&#34; she opens with:  &#34;I wanted to change the world/but I could not even change my underwear And when the s--t got really really out of hand/I had it all the way up to my hairline&#34;  Sure, it's funny, but there's so much more.  In case you think it's all bleak, take heart. Sinead just got very publicly married, separated and reconciled. I can only hope that it sticks, but even if it doesn't, a few songs here reflect her ongoing faith in love. &#34;The Wolf Is Getting Married&#34; and &#34;Back Where You Belong&#34; probably represent Sinead as she sees herself today:  a woman very experienced in the pitfalls of relationships who is prepared, with eyes open, to make a life with a man.  As charged as her lyrics are, what makes this record work for me is the musically diverse crazy quilt of styles she employs throughout. Because of the great production values and variety, HOW ABOUT I BE ME passes my &#34;repeated listenings test&#34; with flying colors. I want to listen to these songs again, and again. Sinead writes a great hook and weaves her conversational lyrics into well-constructed phrases and arrangements. With her producer, John Reynolds, she's come up with a mélange of rock, hip-hop, ska, electronic, and pop elements made cohesive by her wonderful singing. She's lost a little bit of the top of her range -- she tends to switchback and forth between full voice and a whisper as she sings higher -- but she's lost none of the expressive force of her voice overall.  If there's an overarching theme to this album, it's that we are, each of us, a bundle of contradictory impulses vying for dominance in a chaotic landscape of obsessions, desires and higher purpose. She could have titled the album &#34;Angels and Demons,&#34; but that would be much too obvious. Instead, she asks: how about I be me, and you be you? Let's put all our crazy on the table without judgment, examine it from all sides until it loses its power to hurt us, and just love each other anyway.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|I rally want to love this app, and I did for the first couple of days - it has two odd the features I want in a music player: good lock screen and it remembers the last song that played even if it was closed for days. and then I tried the shuffle button on the songs list, it showed me 0 out of 0 songs and when I tried to get out of there it crashed. since I dint want to create a play list for shuffling over all my songs, this is more or less a deal breaker. I would also love to have the option of uploading songs to the cloud This review is for the galaxy s2 on Sprint

0060873027|4.0|I would be curious to know how much of this work is actually that of the late Michael Crichton.  The manuscript(or part of it) was apparently found after the author's death.  Why didn't he pursue it?  Didn't he like it?  Was it unfinished and was it finished by a ghostwriter?  Was it just an outline and completely ghostwritten?  In any event, it is a halfway interesting adventure story, though if you know much science, it's best to shut down that part of your brain.  I was entertained.  Having said that, it's not a great story and not all that original.  I immediately thought of an old movie(I believe it was from the 1940s)called Dr Cyclops, where a mad scientist shrinks down some other scientists then tries to track them down and kill them.  That is essentially the plot of this story as well.  If your looking for entertainment, this book will fit the bill.  However, it is not one of Crichton's great works.  Hopefully, no other post mortem novels will be \\"found\\".  I understand that Jules Verne's son \\"found\\" many novels after the author's death, none of which were very good and none of which really sounded like they had been authored by the elder Verne.  RIP Michael Crichton.
B000KIPT30|1.0|I purchased this as an inexpensive way to have guests be able to plug in and listen while recording podcasts. 1 in 4 out w/ independent volume, seemed like a great fit.  Unfortunately, my timing was bad, and I added this component while reconfiguring my studio.  Once everything was done I was getting a terrible staticy hum/buzz in the headphones.  I immediately began trouble shooting, unpluggin source after source, checking cable after cable. Then finally I turned on the monitors and there was no hum through them. HMM, that finally got me looking at the headphones.  I unplugged them from the amp and plugged them straight into the board and PRESTO, no more hum/buzz.  Man was I dissapointed.  I will be sending it back before my R/E ends, but as a temporary patch, I have it connected to one of the 1/4 Sends to allow my guests to hear for the time being. I literaly couldn't use them, even despite the hum because I couldn't tell what was the actual levels I was getting.  Oh Well, you get what you pay for and apparently I'm going to end up paying $100 for a headphone amp.  Seems like you should get a quality product at any price, if you can't make something well for $20, don't make it at all.  If you do opt for one of these, make sure you add it by itself and do a before/after so you will know what impact it is having on what you are hearing.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Here's my short review: GO BUY IT!  Now, for the details.  Right off, I felt this deep connection to Sophia, the main character.  Growing up gay, I know what it's like to be isolated and ostracised. You see, Sophia practices Wicca and has the unfortunate chance of living in a small town. She has to continually contend with those looks and comments from the whole town, and from one citizen in particular. Nothing like an ultra-Conservative bigot to help you learn who Sophia really is.  Sophia is confident in who she is and who she wants to be, while at the same time being completely unsure of both (due to her ostracisation from her family and townmates), which makes her a very real, very relatable person.  She is not afraid to share her views, but rarely does so to avoid being further isolated. She's the kind of person who would rather take the harrassment and slights than bring them up to stop them, which would only cause more harrassment.  Now, enough of Sophia. On to the plot! (I'm not going to get too detailed because this is the first (and only) book in the series and to get incredibly detailed would unravel the book.)  From the beginning, you don't really know what's going to happen and that continues on throughout the whole book. This keeps you drawn in, wondering, waiting for what happens next.  We meet her mentor, friends, mother, and love interest fairly early in the book (think Night Huntress series, my review of which is pending), which leaves space for story-telling and world-building.  The world is slow to build on at first, but soon after meeting her love interest, it gains speed. From then on it alternates between story-telling and world-building, both being incredibly tied together. Sophia starts off clueless, but is then thrown into this other world. It's remarkably well-writ in it's simple complexity.  About mid-book (or maybe just past), we start learning that Sophia is not at all what she seems. She starts off as a Wicca-practicing human, slowly making the transition into Forever Girl Witch. A Forever Girl is a witch who is a reincarnation of their past lives. (That's all I'm saying on the subject of Forever Girls. Go read it and you'll find out.)  Even though, at the beginning and throughout the book, you've no clue what's going to happen, there's a very subtle background that only just ties into the plot in the beginning and middle, but, in fact, turns out to be the plot! (I didn't see it coming at all, which is very surprising. I rarely don't see what's going to happen, even for a first reading.)  And then, at the end, when you think you know what's going to happen and what's been happening, twist!, it turns on you.  It is truly a testament to Rebecca Hamilton's (follow her on Twitter) abilities that it surprised me. I didn't even have a vague idea where it was going until I got there (which doesn't often happen), which left me with a fierce satisfaction that I didn't know where it was going.  So, to conclude right back where I started: GO BUY IT! You will not regret it at all.
1451627289|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down. The writing and story telling were awesome...the book never once lost my interest: engrossing. I had no clue how this story was going to end, and even though the ending was extremely satisfying, I felt so let down that it was over. I waited a week before I wanted to pick up another book. My husband and son are reading it now and they're saying these same things about 11/22/63.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its okay, nothing awesome but some games are fun. I wouldn't have paid money for it due to the fact that some of the games are just awful and.boring.

0465011020|5.0|Very heart chilling book that hits you at the core. When reading this book I have been taught to appreciate the things that I have in my life. When you read this book you want to let it be known what is actually going on inside North Korea and you realize that the people there are trapped. They may seem to be \\"patriotic\\" but in reality they have no choice or else their entire family could be killed. The concentration camps of North Korea are amazingly inhumane.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|I don't know how to start this review because there is so much I didn't like about this book and these two characters. They both annoyed me.  In the beginning I actually liked Emma but I wasn't so sure about Dexter. You could already see that he was self-centered and open about liking sex with any woman he could get into bed but we are supposed to believe that, barely knowing Emma, he felt differently about her. One lost opportunity to sleep together the night of graduation is the premise for a lifelong almost unrequited love.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  Emma almost marries but comes to her senses and then has an affair with a married man. She then has a career and meets someone who she dumps when a battered alcoholic Dexter fresh out of a destructive marriage visits her in Paris. She's not the smartest woman, is she? Dexter consistently shows what a total self-destructive fool he is while Emma is long suffering and eternally in love with him.  What could have been a genuine star-crossed romance instead was a story of a very dumb woman who waited around for an alcholic, egotistical, self-centered womanizer.  If Dexter had died after Emma married her Frenchman it would have made a lot more sense and I might have given it 3 stars instead of 2.
B005ZUR724|3.0|This game plays great on the Kindle Fire (when the game runs that is...see note below), the graphics are beautiful and the game is just totally fun.<br /><br />(I tried the starter edition of WOW recently but was reluctant to continue with an eventual $15 per month subscription commitment, Plus I really prefer games I can play in little chunks of time at my leisure.)<br /><br />O&C is a lighter, simpler, and more casual kind of WOW and perfect for someone (like myself) just venturing into MMORPG's.  The first 3 months subscription is included in the purchase price with options for $.99 per month or less with 3 or 6 months subscription prices.<br /><br />I recommend this game but do not make in-game purchases until the it becomes more stable. (See note below.)<br /><br />Note:<br />There was an error message on the first start up but it was resolved with a uninstall and reinstall.<br />2/20/12 Most recently my first character can not play due to a game crash in a particular region which Gameloft is working to fix.  In the meantime I've  created another character until they get game glitches and kinks worked out. I am giving the game a 3 star rating in any event due to game play enjoyment and pleasure.  I think once they work through the bugs in time this game will be great on the Kindle Fire.<br />2/24/12 I was finally able to play my first character for a bit yesterday but today the game requires an update which Amazon does not have.  I did an unintall and a reinstall and now am getting an error message from Amazon and it won't download. At this point can't play the game at all.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Great little sharpener for the price.<br /><br />Pros: Does what it promised. I have a simple philosophy in life, You can't just talk the walk, you've got to walk the talk before you earn my respect and hard earned money. Well this little utility sharpener has earned both.<br /><br />Pros: Well designed - Compact-size, well constructed, simple to use.<br /><br />Pros: Safety features (thumb guard) for grip support and as a reminder to park your digits if you wish to get them back in your pocket as a team.<br /><br />Pros: Performance - I sharpened several types of knives and two types of scissors in minuets. They were all capable of shaving hair off my arms, as well as, doing the old single paper slice with just the weight of the blades.<br /><br />Cons: I wanted so bad to give them 5 stars, but had to be honest and gave them a 4. Reason, the labels for the sharpeners \\"V\\" slots (Steel vs Carbide) are almost impossible to read. As a knife enthusiast, I can tell them apart from experience, but even I under poor lighting could get them mixed up. I opted for using a Silver Paint dot.<br />To ease my concern. Something you may want to consider if you own any expensive cutlery.<br /><br />All in all this ones going in my camping bag and  another in my B.O.B survival bag.  my wife wants one in the kitchen and another in the master bathroom which at this price they're well worth it.

B0073CNOE2|5.0|The story line, from season to season is riveting. Each actor adds to the drama in their own right. The writers for this series are so creative, and the actors are all so talented, I can't wait till Season 3 is available on DVD. I will be watching every episode from season 1 through 3.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this game! I just like to run my fingers through the dots, but a first I had no clue how to change colour so I had a tough time looking at these pics, because they all have colour! I got this game for free with the app of the day, but I think you should spend a little money on it. Oh, and if you change the colour it better! If you looking for an awesome, fun game, you came to the right place. BUY GRAVILUX! I love this but I don't know what the dots are. Honestly. :)

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a good game. Ads pop up a lot requesting you download other free games, however most of those games are not available for the kindle fire. As for the 101 games, they all seem to be different, yet fun. Not bad for a free game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is one of the few that I downloaded that I actually enjoy using. It's a little annoying the repetitiveness you have to go to unlock a new game, but overall, this game is excellent for being free.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|An interesting concept poorly executed. That sums my feelings about it. The author's prose is weak and the main character (Katniss) is annoying to say the least. She is self-absorb and clueless 90% of the time. I really wanted to like this book and went in with an open mind but the book didn't do it for me. I give it 3 stars for the concept and story.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love going nuts and whoever doesn't like has never tried it and they just need to admit it. and my little coussin played it and he never got off of it and kept on playing and playing and playing.
B006OFN0SE|1.0|I watched this in the theater with my guy friends; we went into this movie not knowing everything about it. Spoiler alert:<br /><br />J. Edgar is a flaming homosexual. It shows him in dresses & courting a man. Many times. Talk about awkward when sitting next to your guy friends!<br /><br />Also, the MPAA is horrible. Not only are they extraditing a UK student (Richard O'Dwyer) to the United States for linking to copyrighted material (something that's not a crime in the UK), but they're stark raving mad control freaks. Ultraviolet copies that expire? Just another way to pull in more cash and leave you with nothing to show for it, no doubt. BluRay is made by Sony, a notorious supporter of SOPA/PIPA/DRM that tried to jail George Hotz. Research that story for yourself sometime. It's sickening.<br /><br />When you buy these movies, you support....THEM. And their causes. And their stupid, counter-intuitive DRM that only serves to punish & inconvenience the people that buy things legally.<br /><br />We can't give these inbreds the jailtime they deserve, but please, at least don't give them your money. At the VERY least, don't buy this incredibly awkward movie.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I ordered this cover right after I ordered my Kindle Fire.  It fits snuggly in the case and the plastic is very thin and very durable.  If you have kids in the house, this cover is for you.  One big downside for me is, there is no option for a stand in portrait which makes reading in bed or playing Words with Friends (or any other application that I prefer in portrait).  I have missed the window to return but can get a partial refund.  I just ordered Deft Dante 360 degree, one piece holder and am hopeful it will be all I need.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|I want to start off this review by saying I absolutely LOVED this film.  I also know that it has it's fair share of people who hated it, but I'm not trying to convert any of those people, as enjoying films are all about forming your own opinions.  A few things you should do before seeing this movie, however, are:<br /><br />-Do not go into this film expecting a \\"Fast and Furious\\" type car movie.  Don't expect lots of action either.<br />-Read up on the fable of the Scorpion and the Frog (I went in already knowing the story and it's meaning and it gave the film a deeper meaning for me).<br />-Read the book by James Sallis.  The movie does a good job of taking the feel of the book, but also changing the characters around a little bit and delivering a great movie-watching experience.<br /><br />That said, the Blu-Ray has some great special features that were interesting to watch.  I give the film four an a half star rating, and the BR itself five stars.

0307592731|5.0|I received my copy of Wild free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for reviewing the item.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this book - I always enjoy books about the outdoors but usually I enjoy books about people \\"finding themselves\\" to a lesser extent.  What I didn't expect was to be blown away by Cheryl Strayed's honest, unapologetic portrayal of a lost young woman.  She doesn't shy away from describing her drug use, her adultery and eventual divorce from her husband, her anger over her mother's death, and her restless searching for balance and meaning in her life.<br /><br />She impulsively decides to go on an 1,100 mile solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), despite the fact that she had never walked further than a day hike or camped alone.  Her story goes back and forth between relating her daily hiking experiences and recounting the previous 22 years of her life, which helps the reader understand why she seems to have made hurtful and even stupid choices in her past.  As she progresses along her hike, she exorcises the ghosts of alcoholic fathers and dead mothers and eventually forgives herself for past mistakes.  The blisters, hunger and thirst, and temperature extremes she endures while hiking with a huge backpack are her symbolic hair shirt, but she finds she is stronger and more worthy of love and respect than she thought.<br /><br />She describes the people she meets along the trail in vivid detail, and depends on the kindness of strangers for car rides to trail crossings and for hot showers. I could almost smell the forests and see the sunsets, and I laughed at her description of her safety whistle and her various newbie mistakes - all while cheering her on.<br /><br />She has a wonderful way with words, which made a story that could have bogged down in maudlin self-pity into a triumphant journey of growth and maturity that I couldn't wait to finish with her.

B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. It's simple and a ton of fun. I like how it has different challenges to complete to keep things interesting.
0062082353|1.0|I'm sorry but just a few minutes of reading the first page turned my stomach.  It is disgusting that we are over there in another country brandishing weapons and declaring anyone who resists us a 'terrorist' and killing people after calling THEM names such as evil and fiends.  What kind of man does this?  What kind of country trains people to do this?  Why are we there, occupying a sovereign nation that has done nothing to us?  Is this what a 'Christian' nation does?  Calls other people ragheads and kills them indiscriminately?  Now, he's lying about clobbering Jesse Ventura in a bar fight years ago with no apparent witnesses, something that would have made big news if it really happened.  Take him into court, Jesse.  Take this evil cowardly fiend down.  Put him under oath in a deposition and show what kind of person he really is.  You're going to have to answer for every one of those people you killed some day who were only defending their own people. It will not be easy.
B006ON41FC|5.0|When I first got this game I thought it was stupid but now I love it.! It gets super addicting and it's that kind of game that you play when your bored or any time!!!!!
0439023513|5.0|I can't say too much without giving away what happens in the book. What i can say is that Mockingjay is brilliant! It kept my attention just like the first two books to where i could never find a place to stop because it just kept me going. I can't speak for other readers, but for only for myself. If you loved the first two books, you will love Mockingjay just as much!! It is a definite read in my opinion. Cant wait for the movies!!

B006ISJQ3K|5.0|When I walked into The Gramophone in San Francisco that February 1976, I was instantly mesmerized by the cover. I couldn't believe it was her. Motown must have kept the art under wraps before astounding the world with its beauty. &#34;Theme from &#34;Mahogany&#34; was in its 5th month on the charts after hitting #1 for two weeks. Motown then released the gorgeous, possibly even stronger &#34;I Thought it Took a Little Time&#34; Michael Masser ballad.(The picture sleeve 7 inch premiered the gorgeous photo album art). It began its leaps and bounds up the Hot 100 when Motown got word that the 5th Deminsion was releasing a competing version of the money-cut, &#34;Love Hangover&#34;. This caused a shift in gears. Motown readied &#34;Love Hangover&#34; for it's domestic release. They didn't completely abandon &#34;I Thought it Took a Little Time&#34;. They guided that beautiful song to the Top 5 Adult Contemporary Billboard charts.&#34;The Black Album&#34; how it came to be known by Diana fans, was one of the most striking album covers ever released. (It eventually won &#34;The Most Beautiful Album Cover&#34; by the Italian fan club ). &#34;Love Hangover&#34; captured the essence of Victor Skrebeneski back cover art. Hot! Hot! Hot! But back to the fate of one of my favorite songs. A mere 4 years later, Diana would be one of the first artists since The Beatles to place 2 or 3 singles in the Top 10 at the same time. In fact, &#34;The Black Album&#34; would be a landmark by being one of the rare albums to have 4 hit singles. (Diana had achieved that goal as early as &#34;Where Did Our Love Go&#34; with The Supremes). Had Motown kept the fate, I still believe that &#34;I Thought it Took a Little Time&#34; would have been a bigger pop hit.  Diana was also riding high with her critical and commercial smash &#34;An Evening with Diana Ross&#34; tour. It gave &#34;Love Hangover&#34; a special showcase in the show where Diana would invite the audience on stage to dance invoking a big disco party. The success of the tour dictated that another single be released in the form of a remixed &#34;One Love in My Lifetime&#34;. While it was another Top 25 hit, I thought her version of &#34;Smile&#34; had single potential.  The first side of the album was the strongest. Side 2 featured another Diana produced track in her cover of Rufus' &#34;Ain't Nothing But a Maybe&#34;. Both the charming &#34;Kiss Me Now&#34; and &#34;You're Good My Child&#34; had that tin pan alley feel to them.....cute and novel. &#34;The Black Album&#34; would have been greater had the last 4-5 songs were as daring as the first 4-5 songs like the revolutionary, &#34;Love Hangover&#34;.  The last half was a little too safe. However, the album still was a multi-million seller and a Grammy nominated affair.  To this day, the album art remains iconic, &#34;Theme from &#34;Mahogany&#34; is heard the world over and &#34;Love Hangover&#34; raised the bar in the world of grand diva dance records! RATED: 4 stars out of 5. But due to its 40th Anniversary that underscores it's still relevant, it upgrades to 5 stars.  However, this Expanded Edition is a tad disappointing. There are no less than 3 alternate versions of most of the songson the original album.  In my initial listenings, not one of the mixes stood out enough that I did not feel compelled to repeat any of them. Of the new tracks,  her take on Elton John's &#34;Harmony&#34; is the most endearing. &#34;Harmony&#34; is the final song on Elton's &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&#34; album, an album that became the dividing point in my love of Elton's music. &#34;Le Lo LI&#34; is a fun, rhythmic pop track that she sounds delightful in. The Sly Stone produced &#34;Go Where Your Mind Is&#34; is different. The music track and chorus are the most memorable. But you would be hard press to identify it as a Sly Stone song upon initial listening. The closing interview is a great time capsule. So this Expanded Edition isn't as rich with unfounded material as the previous releases.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|The box set arrived at least a few days earlier than I expected.  The package was a bit damaged (mail carrier decided to jam the package into the hooks of my mailbox instead of between my doors like Everyone else!).  The disks and the box they were in had NO damage whatsoever.  Overall, I love Dr. Who, this set has awesome features, no damages at all to the box, disks, or inserts; wonderful service from Amazon.  I will order from these guys again.  Thanks for your time!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game. I haven't had an issue with the game yet and I have just recently gotten 2 of my friends hooked on the game. That's all we do now when the 3 of us hang out. I love it.

B005DF2QMC|4.0|I purchased this items for my parents, my Mom is blind so she listens to a lot of books on tape. Well with tapes going out she wanted to get her current tapes on CD. So I ordered this, I did have to go through 3 units to get it to work. I returned it and promptly received a credit, ordered another and same error. I reached out to their tech department, I had to do some research to get an e-mail (dbtech@camarketingusa.com) for those of  you who need it, I did have to do some digging to get it. However once I sent the e-mail they were quick to respond, they let me keep the second unit and they sent out the third one. I got the same error, their tech person reached out to me several times to make sure it worked. I got super busy at work and also had some illness running rampent. Once I got everything calmed down he connected to me and got it working. The product now works and it is easy for my parents to use who are not \\"computer\\" people, so that is a plus!! They were very good to me, and even with me not getting back to him, he made it a point to get me up and running and sent 4 or 5 e-mails just to check in to see if I had time. Good product, but the customer service was better.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a fantastic app. I can type so much more accurately which is good for professional emails. Also, I love how much you can can change, from the length of haptic feedback to the size of the keys.

B007BDK3SS|5.0|This game is the best game I have played on my kindle! Good level creativity and solid controls (button and tilt)  makes this a game worth buying.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Fun spin on Mahjong.  Addicting! Story is uninteresting, but who cares.  Like the graphics and gameplay G5 continues to deliver great entertaining games.
B0078N2MTE|4.0|If everyone in the room thinks you are crazy , maybe you are, or they just don't know what you know. Your crazy  till it happens, and then your the sanest person in the room. Sometimes you just got to loose your mind to deal with reality, or see what is really going on. Is one crazy for being prepared for what might come, no, but one thing is for certain, it's not going to do you any good, if your miles away from where you are prepared for a desater. If the end of the world does come, do you really want to be the last one standing. Who are you gong to tell, I told so, talk about a lost moment.<br /><br />It is a little slow, but it did keep me interested, which isn't easy with all of the slow moving train wrecks they put out any more. The train don't have to cost a lot of money, it just has to go somewhere, and you have to be able to stay on it. Bad acting, bad writng, bad story are all like bumps on the track, to many bumps and and I'm not staying on the train. This track was pretty smooth, the ending was a bit of a dead end, but the train got to where it needed to go, but I would have liked to have seen what happened next, but I guess that's what your imagination is for. Use it. I did, and it was't good.<br /><br />I rented it. I think it was worth a $3.99 rental.<br />Call me crazy, but I'm thinking of buying it.
0439023513|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the whole series, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it for a pre-teen child. There is a lot of violence, including kids killing kids, and evil, and very depressing scenes. At the very least, I'd recommend you read it yourself before giving it to a child, or read it WITH your child.
031603441X|5.0|I'd really give this 4.5 stars, the end of the book does kind of fall apart, but why quibble.  Completely amazing account of a completely original and unique life.  These guys created rock stars, without a script.  The Stones were a bigger band than the Beatles.  Keep in mind that by the time the Beatles were dealing with super stardom they had quit touring, and were only together for a couple of years.  It was a totally debilitating for them, but the Stones weathered through for another 40 some years.  After reading this I don't quite know whether to admire the guy or feel sorry for him, but I think it's more of the former.  He, and those around him, suffered greatly under the weight of his drug habit, but he might have been the world's most productive drug addict.  Keith never really gave up drugs, drugs gave up Keith.  It was like the world's most powerful drugs tried to destroy his life for 50 years and eventually the just drugs gave up - they met their match.  He's very frank about his failings as a parent.  His account of this early life, the formation of the Stones, how he dealt with stardom (the anti-star), and the personalities he met along the way is absolutely first rate.  The Stones were at the vanguard of the cultural and societal changes during the last 50 years.  The story of his life is in many ways the story of our times.  His account of the evolution of his musical style and instrumental expertise is great.  From his discovery of the open G tuning, to his admission that he can't sing and play at the same, to his alternative use of the low E string (which he removed from the guitar), to tips on a night driving (tip - don't ever drive over the Atlas Mountains at night with Keith), to how to crawl out from under a studio sound board, to how to get a gun and a bag full of ammunition through airport security, you can't get enough.  The most fascinating part is his description of his relationship with Mick Jagger.  I really wonder what Mick thought afterreading this book, I can't imagine that he didn't read it.  Keith laid it on the line, the good and the bad.  You get a great insight into their creative process and how the Stones biggest hits were created and recorded.  I especially like how the author wrote the book in Keith's voice, it's like a long conversation with Keith.  You really do feel like you know the guy after you read the book.  Just amazing, and the highest recommendations to anyone
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game it's really cool and you play different games with different topics I recommend this to anyone!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|A great way to waste extra time. If you're bored with Solitaire this is fun and easy. I give this a triple A+ for it's ease to use. And, you don't always lose or win.  S. M. M.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its nice to download one program and have different games. I get bored easily of all the other apps and the more I download the slower my kindle fire
B000001FO4|4.0|that this band has suffered because of marketing and image.  They're an underrated band, mostly because of being placed in the wrong subgenre, and also just plain bad luck.  Their first album (Night Songs, which was OK/mediocre) featured a pretty ridiculous cover photo, posing as a complete hair band, which was the style then, and you can't really blame them or the studio execs for going with the whole Poison/Motley Crue/Ratt thing when it was a fad.  But that's not who Cinderella really are.  Hair \\"metal\\" went out of favor as Nirvana and the grunge thing came on the scene, but the fact is that Cinderella is a hard blues rock band (does that ever go out of style?).  That's why you'll sometimes hear the comment that this album has aged better than \\"other\\" hair metal - it's because it's not really hair metal.  Cinderella is a hard working touring band and great to see in a small venue.  I love to watch bands work this hard in a show, and the show I saw was about sweat and rock and roll and caring about their job, not about hair or costumes or a \\"screw-you-I-just-woke-up-and-I-want-to-get-drunk-and-go-back-to-bed\\" attitude.  Long Cold Winter is a really good album, far closer to good old Aerosmith than to any lame hair band.  In fact if you like older Aerosmith then I dare you to listen to the first 2 tracks and not be hooked.  This is a pretty consistent album, so if you like one song you'll probably not really dislike any of them.  Only a couple filler songs (Second Wind, Fire and Ice - but those are as good as any old Aerosmith filler), two good ballads (Coming Home and Don't Know What You Got), and otherwise a good hard rock album, starting off with a very cool acoustic guitar/harmonica bluesy intro to song 1.  After this, they moved a little more toward country/blues/rock with that raspy, smoky vocal of Keifer, on Heartbreak Station.  But it's a shame this album didn't vault them to stardom and luck didn't go their way, because otherwise we might just have anotherband with a discography as strong as Aerosmith or AC/DC or ZZ Top.  I guess the timing just wasn't right.....  If you like the basic sound, at least get yourself a Best Of Cinderella album.  For the 4 studio albums, pick your style:  - Night Songs - Poison/Ratt with several good tunes (Night Songs, Shake Me, Somebody Save Me, Push Push)  - Long Cold Winter - more like bluesy old Aerosmith hard rock  - Heartbreak Station - starts off with a couple old Aerosmith-type tunes, but then reminiscent of old Rolling Stones, country/cowbell/blues rock (Shelter Me, Heartbreak Station, One For Rock and Roll)  - Still Climbing - more like AC/DC

0525478817|5.0|John Green, as well as being an amazing author, is also vlogger on youtube who inspires and educates hundreds of thousands of people called nerdfighters (we don't fight nerds, we are nerds who fight). Some of these people are in a hit band called Bloom, and they wrote a song that is in itself a better review than I think most people could give. This is the link to that song.[...]
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is just a great, great album. I'd been streaming it for the last week or so, and it's just so fresh and so energetic. The songs capture a wild, passionate and youthful sound in the vein of The Naked and Famous, Foster the People and Cage the Elephant. It's the kind of music that makes you want to jump for joy and do wild and crazy things---just see the video for \\"We Are Young\\" ([...]). I'm not promoting violence, though, so be good. :)
0307719774|4.0|I really like this book. It may be small but if you write small as well then you won't have a problem fitting in your answer. I love the questions and I'm looking forward to seeing the differences in my answers as the years come.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Moon is an excellent movie, one of my all time favorites, but is not for everyone.  If you are the kind of person that sees a movie once and hates to see it again, then Moon is not for you.  Move on and stick with afternoon soaps.  However, if you can watch a movie over and over again, and enjoy it more each time, then Moon is right up your alley.  Moon must be watched more than once, and from start to finish.  If you break it up into pieces, or multitask at the same time, you'll miss out the movie's depth and detail.
B006ON41FC|4.0|awesome I love this app. so cool cool cool cool cool collect them ants because ethey are awesome and good for you y athat is right get those nuts
B005723JSQ|5.0|I hesitated in purchasing this book but since the reviews were so good (reader & magazines), I decided to go for it.  And am I glad I did!  While I've read two of Sophie's books (Twenties Girl & Confessions of a Shopaholic) and enjoyed them, I'm just not a big fan of \\"chick lit\\". If you feel the same way I do, take a chance on the book.  This book is a good time - like spending the afternoon with friends.  I got invested into the characters, into the story and into Poppy's life.  I needed a good escape and this book provided it for me. In fact, I had such a good time, I'm going to go back and read some of her books I've missed.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is sooooooooo good.  wish you could move side to side faster, but the game is still strait up raw
1416550534|3.0|I had heard a couple people talk about this book, so curious, I decided to check it out.  I didn't really get into it though.<br /><br />Its the early 1900's and at Riverton, the servants keep to their own and let their \\"uppers\\" rule pretty much everything.  One servant in particular, is Grace, who early on starts serving the younger daughters of the family and grows close to them.  Or as close as a servant can.  One of the sisters, Hannah, she stays with for years as a ladies maid and helps her cover secrets.  Including what really happened that night a famous poet died.  The story follows Grace and the family for many years, as they reach new steps in their lives.<br /><br />I couldn't connect to any of the characters.  There just wasn't enough there to make them real to me.  And their lives were very foreign from mine, which normally doesn't matter with book characters, but for some reason it did with these.  Even the main character of the book, Grace, who leads us through this story, she was more telling their stories than her own and I couldn't relate to her either.  She seemed nice and loyal enough, but not interesting.<br /><br />The pace was very slow.  And somewhat jumpy as we went from the present to the past through Grace's eyes.  She tended to relate a lot that wasn't even the main premise of the book.  More memories than anything.  It wasn't terribly written.  In fact, it had a nice flow to it, but a slow one.  The elements of the time seem to be spot on, so you can tell the author did the research.  And there's nothing really offensive in this book in regards to sex, cussing, etc.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'd read anything else by this author.  It just didn't grab me.<br /><br />The House at Riverton<br />Copyright 2006<br />470 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

0307949486|5.0|I picked this book up mainly just to see what all the fuss was about.  A few chapters in, I was a bit perplexed.  Why was everyone going on about this odd little turkey of a book?  It takes forever for the action to get rolling, large sections seem to hinge on Swedish libel law, and the prose doesn't seem to be particularly sharp.<br /><br />Then, I noticed something odd - I just couldn't put the damn thing down.  Forget the details around it, the story in this novel is simply tight, well constructed, and gripping.  It doesn't suffer from the flood of details and characters that often drag down mystery novels.  It's just pure, uncompromising pulp fiction, and it's incredibly enjoyable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app is the best app I have by far. I use it all the time and I cant seem to put in down when its open. I recommend to all people no matter what your religion.

B003UBTX72|3.0|Like other reviewers I wish he said more about the music.  When he does it is great and really kept my interest.  It is amazing how much detail he remembers!  It did not take long for me to become bored with the many, many travelogues about the girls, the drugs, the trips, the legal problems, and various acquaintances along the way.  For me, there was much detail I was just not interested in.  I did feel as if I had to go to rehab after reading this book...I do not know how he could have done drugs for so long and still be alive.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I am totally blown away by this album. It is simply amazing and well crafted. It is haunting and beautiful and depressing and uplifting all in one. All of the songs are unique and yet complete one another. This is a pure return to form for one of the most underrated singers of the past 20 years. Amazing work!
1439102732|5.0|Jodi Picoult does a wonderful job with this book but I think a more open-minded person would enjoy it versus someone who is anti-gay. You really feel the love that Zoe and Max have for each other in the beginning and even though their relationship ends you never get the impression that they hate each other, even during the trial. I've read a lot of negative reviews of this book but I think Jodi did a great job with each one of the characters and they seemed very real. I've met people people who think the way the \\"Christians\\" in this book do. Some people find it hard to believe Zoe fell in love again so soon but she was in a lot of pain and when she met Vanessa, Vanessa gave her something to live for that that is just what Zoe needed so it made sense. You can really tell Jodi did her research on the topic and included reference to real organizations, real cases, etc. I loved that the story is told from more than one point of view. You really get a sense of how Max, Zoe, and Vanessa really feel about what is going on and this helps you get to know the other characters a little better as well. I absolutely loved the last chapter and I read it while being choked up with tears. It was a great ending although not everyone got what they wanted. I would have liked to have known what happened to some of the other characters in the end though, especially Lucy and Reid. Overall, this was a wonderful book and you really don't know the ending until the end because it could have very easily gone in another direction.

I do have a wonderful friend who once in a while is able to goad me away from the T.V. or computer and make me delve into something a little more literary in nature now and then, and usually, as a result, I end up with a new favorite book to add to my collection. (Though I actually bought this book first and prompted her to read it, and of course she breezed through it, loved it, and then had to prompt me to read it. Repeatedly. But I digress.) What I am trying to say is that I rarely read, so it's an even rarer occurrence that I read the entirety of a book in a single day as I did with this one.  Let me just say that I've read few things that were as achingly beautiful yet as brutally honest as John Green's latest novel.  It deals in a very frank manner, with the issues of life, death, illness, love, relationships and all points in between. It centers around a trio (mostly a duo) of teenagers who are either suffering from or recovering from various cases of cancer, but by no means is this some depressive plodding sob-fest,(Though it certainly has its heart wrenching moments). On the contrary this gorgeously nuanced, brilliantly insightful novel will have you laughing out loud and crying your eyes out, many times within the confines of the same page. It will make you contemplate your mortality and realize just how much you treasure those you love.  I cannot stress this enough. Go buy this book, and read it immediately. You won't regret it. I know I certainly didn't. My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner. Don't make the same mistake.
B007B8EGVI|5.0|Continues to be for the most part just a great drama, you do have your moments of zombie and the gore moments but its the continual great story that keeps me going.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book presented me with two things I hate to read. The first, that the protagonist is female. Now, before that insults anyone, let me explain why. As a female, I hate with a burning passion female characters who are more concerned with their would-be lovers than with the story line. Here, Hunger Games completely satisfied me. While Katniss does have to deal with who she truely loves and what she's looking for in a future mate (i.e., Gale or Peeta) she worries about it in such away that she comes off, not a weak, stereotypical female, but rather, as a strong, independent woman. I fell in love with Katniss in a way I usually don't in other similar works. My second problem was that the series is written in first person. That is a perspective that is incredibly difficult to carry off, and most authors cannot do it. I believe Collins did a wonderful job. The books were fast paced and compelling despite the perspective, and that was carried forward through Katniss herself. I admit at times you want to shake the girl for being so oblivious, but it is rather refreshing to find a character who is so *in* character that she/he/they miss things that may seem obvious to an outsider.  After reading these books, this first one especially, I recommended it to all of my friends, and they have all loved it. We've gotten to the point where all of us are sitting together, gasping or jumping, and then putting the books down so we can discuss what's going on.  I would recommend this book to anyone. Though if you buy this first one, I suggest you buy the others, because you'll go through them so quickly you may get frustrated at the wait between arrivals.

B006LS7DQE|3.0|I bought this game when it first came out on XBL, and was excited to see it available for the fire, but its a sloppy port with quirks that can get annoying.  I've had battles hault because the NPC stops playing, touch controls can be less than responsive, and some quest dialog doesn't display.  It would be nice if they would fix this game, but I have little hope.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|When I went to see this movie in December, inwardly I was lamenting the overall quality of movies in 2011, with a plethora of remakes, reboots and sequels, and I wondered if Hollywood was running out of fresh ideas, while recycling the same formulas.  Remakes/reboots in 2011 included  Straw Dogs, Footloose, Arthur,  The Thing, Conan, Spy Kids, Final Destination 5, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />Some of the movies were high quality such as Girl with the dragon tattoo, and Xmen First Class.<br /><br />Last year Michelle Williams deservedly received her second Academy Award nomination for [[ASIN:B0036TGTDE Blue Valentine]], and now she is nominated for the role of Marilyn Monroe.  I liked this movie enormously, and was disappointed that it did not get nominated for Best Picture instead of Extremely Loud and Incredibly close, a dubious choice.<br /><br />Nevertheless politics being what it is  if MWWM was nominated it might give the appearance of Weinstein Studios having too much sway with the Academy Awards, as they also released the Artist with 11 nominations, and the appalling Iron Lady whose only redeeming grace is Meryl Streeps nominated performance, and last year had The Kings Speech.<br /><br />What Michelle Williams and the movie delivers is a very delicately nuanced and multi dimensional portait of Marilyn that we have not seen previously, those shifts in personality, her ability to be vunerable, to charm, to seduce and manipulate, and if you are Larry Olivier the ability to frustrate your ambition to make an incredible movie. In a perhaps ironic twist in view of recent events we see the entourage of people who can't say no or risk punishment or exclusion.<br /><br />So we have a young wideeyed  man who through connections gets his first job in the business working for Olivier, and responsible for keeping things even with Marilyn. If you're like me you wonder if he will be drawn too far into the web of Marilyn, and if the obvious siren attraction of Marilyn will be his doom.  They grow close and here is where the movie takes some liberties on the book on which it's based, but the will they won't they aspect will keep you guessing after the final credits roll.  The movie captures the period very well.<br /><br />Although most attention has focused on the performance of Michelle Williams, I loved the performance of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier. He listened to Oliver on audio to perfect the mannerisms and the lines, and even had the exact same shoes custom made to fit the part.<br /><br />It seems fitting that someone who has spent a career following in Olivier's footsteps, acting Shakespeare and bringing the plays to the screen, may finally get the Academy Award for walking in his shoes.<br /><br />It's clear here that he is a superior actor, and perfectly achieves both his theatrical mannerisms and intonations particularly rolling the R's, and all the grand subtleties of the theatrical master.  At the end of the movie he delivers a portion of a soliloquy from Prospero in The Tempest.  This for me was like a spiritual experience, it was so sublime.  Naturally,  I hope that he wins although Christopher Plummer appears to the stern competition this year winning several awards in the runup including the Golden Globe.<br /><br />When I left this movie I felt optimistic and relieved at finally seeing a good movie.  Shortly afterwards all the best movies were released in time for an Oscar run including  The Descendants,  The Artist, Warhorse, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.  So, if you want to be an Oscar contender release your movie in December.<br /><br />Recently we have seen a trend in the Academy Awards toward real life characters with Marion Cotillard winning for  portraying Edith Piaf, Helen Mirren for playing the queen, Colin Firth for playing a king, Christian Bale for playing an addict.  Usually the character has some flaw or adversity to cope with, tragedy, a stutter, addiction.  This yearit's  Alzheimers, addiction/neurosis and racial discrimination.<br /><br />I loved this movie.  I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.ill enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.

B0053O8AQE|5.0|For someone who normally doesn't watch tv, this fun and sassy show have become one of my all time favorites. The comedy, although can be pretty raunchy, is still funny as hell to the point where you don't care if it's offensive or not. Every character is hilarious, memorable, and has their own interesting personality. The relationship between the two main characters is both funny and even sweet. Each episode had me laughing my ass off, and it's become the thing I look forward to every Monday night.  What else can I say? I loved this show!

B005LAIGW8|1.0|First let me say we loved the first Ghost Rider; a simple story, excellent transitions, good acting. Along comes #2 Ghost Rider: We're excited. And it's an awesome ... letdown. The filming was jagged, with Photoshopped stills thrown in (what's up with that!), too many shots of the flaming head for no reason, a scene where he suddenly goes from nonfire mode to flamed and peeing fire (why?), his flaming chain scenes don't compare to GR#1 ... and on and on in that vein. The most insulting thing, according to my husband, was the motorcycle used didn't go with the sound of the motorcycle used, and everyone who's ever rode a chopper knows it. And when the main actor is upstaged by Idris Elba, you wonder what influence the directors had on Nicolas Cage, or was something wrong with Nicolas Cage? I think this movie was aimed at a lower age group/less critical audience. The director's fault? The writer's fault? The studio's fault? The actor's fault? Everyone raise your hand.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This thing does not work at all!!! It was the most worthless purchase i have ever made. It did not make it better it actually made it worse to play. It made it so it couldnt see me most of the time. It also made it so it couldnt figure out where i was standing even though i was standing right where i was suppose to. So i do not recommend anyone buying this item cause it just makes the kinect work way worse. We even moved it to different spots and it didnt work at all. So do not buy this for your kinect if you only have a small play space to use.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is the best mechanic in New Beijing but even that distinction can't buy her freedom. Cinder doesn't have any of that--not when she is a Cyborg.<br /><br />Legally tied to a stepmother who despises her, Cinder spends her days fixing machines at her stall and dreaming of escape. Those lofty plans are dashed when her stepsister falls suddenly and hopelessly ill. Cinder is the first person her guardian blames and the only one to be punished. Instead of the death sentence she expected, Cinder finds an unlikely source of knowledge about her murky past not to mention the improbable attentions of New Beijing's handsome prince.<br /><br />Soon Cinder finds herself in the middle of an intergalactic power struggle that could have dire consequences--especially for Cinder. The more she learns about her past, the less she understands. If Cinder can confront the truth, she might be able to do something. She just isn't sure if it will already be too late in 'Cinder' (2012) by Marissa Meyer.<br /><br />'Cinder 'is Meyer's first novel. It is also the first book in the four-book Lunar Chronicles.<br /><br />There are a lot of retellings of 'Cinderella' in the world. Meyer brings a fresh eye to this popular fairy tale adding an utterly original spin to a familiar story. Filled with nods to the original story (most notably Cinder's mechanical foot), Meyer also excellently evokes the hectic, crowded city of New Beijing.<br /><br />With its futuristic, sci-fi slant, this story could have easily gotten carried away explaining the world or simply laying on too many nuances to be believed. Meyer avoids these pitfalls both creating a well-realized setting and presenting it without overwhelming readers.<br /><br />Despite its obviously futuristic execution, 'Cinder' is firmly grounded in fairy tale lore. As a result the predictability of the narrative might have been unavoidable. As it is, several things are very obvious within the first few chapters of the story. However, it is not until the last chapter than any early predictions are confirmed (or nullified as the case may be). While the story is clever and immensely entertaining, I would have loved to see Cinder come into her own earlier in the novel instead of having to wait to see much of that transformation in book two.<br /><br />'Cinder' is ultimately a unique interpretation of a story that has already been told many times. Filled with twists and new details all its own, 'Cinder' takes a familiar story and makes it refreshingly exciting and gripping. I can't wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Clockwork Angel by Cassandra Clare, Incarceron by Catherine Fisher, 'Ash' by Malinda Lo, Legend by Marie Lu, Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi, Under the Never Sky by Veronica Rossi, Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Laini Taylor(or nullified as the case may be).

B006UG90RM|4.0|What a saga the Van Halen history makes.  Indeed, it's amazing how such a powerhouse band that absolutely crushed any competition in its heyday could reach the heights of top selling albums, personnel splits and then tank and very nearly disappear without a trace.  So it was no surprise that fans of the first incarnation that lasted through \\"1984\\" with David Lee Roth as one of the greatest frontmen ever, and hated the Sammy Hagar era Van Halen, would approach the reuniting of Roth with the Van Halen brothers with a healthy amount of skepticism.<br />  Fret not.  \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" is a slamming heavy album that stylistically belongs in the \\"Fair Warning\\" era of the band, and that is a good thing.  The opening track \\"Tattoo\\" is a Stonesy tune that doesn't offend, but doesn't hint at the assault that's awaiting right after it.  In that sense it's a bit like \\" . . . And The Cradle Will Rock\\", a mid paced tune that wasn't especially bad or anything, but jeez Louise, who can forget the ultra heavy following track \\"Everybody Wants Some!\\", a track that elevated their third album \\"Women and Children First\\" into the pantheon of the heaviest albums ever?<br />  Plus, and this is huge, the album is not produced by Ted Templeman, whose production was absolutely terrible through \\"1984\\".  I haven't heard any remasters, but especially with the first two albums, Eddie's guitars were panned hard to one side and the sound was pathetically thin.  By the time of \\"Diver Down\\" the mix was terrible, with Alex Van Halen's cymbals pushing everything else out of the mix and creating a very noisy tinny tone that makes listening to that album excruciating.  This new album, which contains mainly older unreleased tracks, was produced by Van Halen and John Shanks.  This time, Eddie's guitars are thick and layered, the drums sound like thunderstorms and the whole CD bursts with power this reviewer frankly thought Van Halen, with or without Roth, could ever achieve.  And what about the guitars?  Guitar magazines will once again drool and declare him as the best guitarist of the year.  But leave it to say that the leads are wickedly cool, the rhythms chop along with the ferocity of any current metal band and best of all, recall the glory years when Eddie first blew minds on their debut album.<br />  \\"Chinatown\\" thrashes with the best of them, and the boys recall the acoustic intro of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" with \\"Stay Frosty\\".  And best of all, there are no ballads or horrible crap like \\"How Do I Know When It's Love?\\"  It's pure vintage Van Halen, and I guarantee for those still hesitant given the last several years of inactivity and the terrible music that Van Hagar made, it's safe to pick up \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\".  And it's way cool to show the actual early streamliner locomotive of the New York Central on the cover, and keeping the railroad's nameplate intact on the cowcatcher.

0385342063|5.0|I've been eagerly anticipating Sophie Kinsella's newest book, I've Got Your Number. Once I had it in my hot little hands, I had to stop and savour the cover and have a quick peek at the last page number - just to see how many there were to enjoy. (433) Then, ensure that I had nowhere to be or anything that needed doing right away - and only then begin, because I just knew I wouldn't want to put it down. (I was right!)<br /><br />Poppy Wyatt is celebrating her upcoming wedding at a champagne tea with girlfriends at a hotel. Everyone has been oohing and ahhing over her engagement ring - a family heirloom of her fiance. A fire alarm drill sends everyone running and afterwards - no one can find the ring. After much frantic searching, she steps outside to see if she can get cell phone reception to pick up her messages - and is promptly robbed of her phone by someone on a bicycle. She needs that phone! When she spies a cell phone in a garbage bin...well... finders keepers, right?<br /><br />And here the fun begins. When the phone rings, Poppy answers it without checking the screen. Hmm, apparently the phone belonged to Violet - personal assistant to Sam Roxton of White Globe Consulting. Sam desperately needs Violet to stop a client, Mr Yamasaki, from leaving the hotel. And since Violet seems to have quit her job, Sam implores Poppy to keep Mr Yamasaki occupied until Sam's elevator reaches the main floor. Honestly, I was laughing out loud at the antics Poppy employs.<br /><br />Poppy somehow gets Sam to agree to 'share' the phone with her. You can see it coming can't you? Missed messages, mixed messages and more...<br /><br />I have to say that although I have enjoyed each and every one of Sophie Kinsella's previous chick lit books, I think this is my favourite. (so far!) Poppy is a wonderfully engaging character. She's absolutely the kind of friend you'd love to have. Warm, caring, smart (but she doesn't think so) yet ditzy at the same time. The more she tries to make things 'right', the more wrong they end up. And of course the love story. Will Sophie marry Magnus or.... And yes, even though you can predict the outcome, the journey there is so enjoyable. A light hearted, comical romp of a read that will have you laughing out loud and rooting for Poppy to find true love.<br /><br />Kinsella has used different 'hooks' in her past books, such as emails scattered throughout. This time it is footnotes Poppy injects in her story; they're a fun addition to the book.<br /><br />Yes, it was a five star read for me - nobody does chick lit better than Kinsella.

0810995212|5.0|I ordered this book because I have a calling card of J.C. Leyendecker's, with a few of his doodles on the back of it. I picked it up when my aunt took me to his studio in New Rochelle, which she rented after his death. I always remember Leyendecker as the \\"Arrow shirt man\\", from his ads. The book is a beautiful book, with dozens of pictures of his paintings. It will be so nice to know, now, how he, along with Norman Rockwell, portrayed America through the decades. In ending, I was also very surprised to find my aunt, Molly Guion, spoken of in the book. I wish I had been more attuned to the fame in this man's life, but as a 10 year old, who would? A great buy, especially if you love art portraying America. I wish I could get one of his paintings, but I guess that would be impossible, as they are apparently, so rare.

B0076I624W|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I have bought this on VHS, single disc DVD and the Ultimate DVD. Been waiting a long time for it to finally get an American release on blu ray. If you are on this page you already know what an amazing film this is. All the cast are excellent especially Anthony Hopkins. The story he tells Death about how he met his wife brings tears to my eyes everytime. This is a heart wrenching film full of loss. Loss of family, loss of innocence and loss of your life's work. In the end it's really about redemption, doing what's right and how your life touches others. I know a lot of people say this movie is way too long and it needs to be edited down to run in half the time. In my opinion the time feels right. It gives everyone screen time to flesh out their characters and make you feel for them when terrible things enter their lives. I never felt like this movie drags or slows down. I hang on every word and relish every scene. This movie is full of great scenes. I am preordering as soon as I finish this review. Can't wait to relive Meet Joe Black again in HD. Hurry May 1st.

Although due to the brief scene where Catherine Morland is reading a portion outloud out of the book The Monk (which involved a graphic portrayal of a man's passion as he lusted after a woman - incidentally, an actual error in the movie - an Austen women would NEVER have been reading that kind of Gothic novel) and a scene of a woman in bed (although covered up with a sheet) prior to losing her character, as well a some totally out of character \\"lingering\\" glances directed towards women by background male characters...due to these things, I don't recommend it to people without a disclaimer. I still loved this movie though. JJ Fields made it for me. =)
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I was first hesitant about watching this movie after the last couple of Planet of the Apes were butchered. I waited and listened to the reviews from everyone else and finally decided to give it a watch. The movie was incredible. Great story, great effects, and great cinematography. This is one of the best movies that I have seen in the last year or more.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok but kinds boring. the games are fun but take forever to beat and they cost too many points to buy buy new ones
B00650SSWG|3.0|This was kind of your typical \\"chick flick\\" romantic comedy. It had its funny moments, and for anyone interested, there is some brief nudity of both Mila (which I should have probably added a star for) and Justin. The movie is nothing spectacular, but it's a good movie to watch on the couch with your significant other.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|The latest version never gives me feedback of problem while signing in. But whenever I try to perform anything it ask me to sign in again. It is impossible to use it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I received this as a gift for Valentines day and I'm really happy with it. It seems to be made well, haven't really put it through the paces yet though. It nicely holds my D60 w/ battery grip attached, an 18-55mm and 55-200mm lens with an external flash and my camera harness. I will be getting an adapter to use some old pentax glass and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find a place for all of the stuff I will be adding. With the extra weight I can see the top handle coming undone like others have said but for what I'm carrying I think it'll be just fine. And I really love the zippers and their pull tabs. Why? I dunno really, they just feel nice.  However, I find the front slip pocket to be a little odd, nothing really camera related that I would stick in there so it's kind of a waste of space. But other than that, I'd buy it if it wasn't given to me.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its so mu ch fun but I have to watch my time playing it because I get addicted. so much fun!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|...and I don't mean that negatively. It's good, I think, to strive for accuracy and truth to original intent.  After reading many of the reviews on Amazon about the various versions of the original trilogy (on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray), I am just confused.  Still, fwiw, I do recall \\"A New Hope\\" not being on the crawl when I saw the original Star Wars in a theater in 1977.  I just finished watching the Blu-ray version of Episode IV, and I thought it was fabulous, even if Greedo did shoot first this time around. That does bother me a little, but it happened so fast, I must say I wouldn't have noticed it had I not seen someone wearing a \\"Han Shot First\\" T-shirt the other day.  Here's the catch, as far as I'm concerned. Han Solo commented that the Millennium Falcon made the Kessel Run in less that 12 parsecs. Hello! A parsec, as many of us space geeks and also even regular people know, is a unit of distance and not of time. Can't believe I didn't notice that in the 70s, when I was even geekier, and certainly more observant (I would think), than the current middle-aged version of me. Wonder if this blunder was added as an \\"enhancement\\"?  Just had to go on record about that parsec thing. Still, I thought the Blu-Ray version was great, and I'm going to just stop trying to figure out what's original and what was changed along the way. Though if the original theatrical versions of Episodes IV-VI appear on the horizon in Blu-ray format (though I'm not sure that's technically possible), count me in!
B006ON41FC|5.0|good for when you don't have anything else to do , the achievements are addicting! the only bad thing is that it won't stop asking me to rate in the middle of my game -___-
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|The show is great and this Blu-ray is an excellent value. The Blu-ray set has all of the series 2 shows and the christmas special which I have seen on sale by itself on BR for twice as much as this set alone. Get this BR set, you wont regret it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I haven't played in a long time and now I'm hooked again! This is a great version of the game.
B005HSL626|5.0|great app.... but paid one has a lot more things to do........ but try this first to see if u like it before paying
0439023513|4.0|This is the ending to an incredible series.  Each book is amazing by itself, but put them all together and what a story.  Collins characterization helped to draw the reader in.  I often found myself so engrossed that I found myself oblivious to my surroundings.  There was only one thing about this book that disappointed me, but to say it would give the ending completely away.  Enjoy!
1451627289|5.0|Here's a new book by the King of Horror.  11/22/63.  I don't read novels or stories by Stephen King.  I know. I know.  I'm an adult, but I still have bad dreams.  I say it's because I am incredibly creative and have a vivid imagination--I have to blame it on something.  Don't judge this book by it's author; it's not what you think when you hear \\"Stephen King.\\"  Read this book!
0385535139|5.0|As always John Grisham has another winner here.  This book is interesting and hard to put down.  John Grisham shows a sense of humor and this book was very entertaining.
1439153663|2.0|Rolling on the tide of The Help, a book that every reading group in America has discussed in the last two years, ours chose The Kitchen House for an historical take on the issue.  This book contains characters that are abused, misused and misconstrued.  Not a one survives unscathed.  The book starts with a hanging, and one cannot help but keep that in the back of one's mind when reading: who is it that has been hung? which \\"mother\\" is running through the woods? who is the child that is desperately following along?  Right off the bat, one suspects trouble.  And trouble there is, most of the children succumb in one fashion or the other.  Those who succeed in growing older are troubled by terrible circumstances (rape, mental illness, separation from loved ones etc etc.) The slaves, both kitchen house and farm, are abused by horrid white men - young and old.  While I am sure this happened, gratuitously adding one nice guy doesn't go very far.  Actually, there were two nice guys, the old owner dies a nasty death before he can get a grip on the horrific circumstances his plantation has fallen under in his absence; the second, younger nice guy is conveniently removed a certain distance in order for the book to carry the spiral further downward. Additionally, it is positively unlikely that an indentured Irish girl would be adopted by an established family and given such preferential treatment.  Her servitude with the slave help is more believable.<br /><br />I found there was not a single character that was likable.  I do not mind flawed persons, but these were extreme and garnered no sympathy.<br /><br />So, what is to like?  The author is very talented at setting a scene and I have kept a vivid picture in my mind of the plantation and its surroundings.  I could draw you a map.  Some pictures of all the buildings even.  She also is very able when it comes to describing people, and their personalities.  Other books combine the story with the descriptive qualities to make a whole that is worthwhile, this one falls short.hile, this one falls short.
B006ON41FC|3.0|would be 5 stars if not for open feint . slows the game way down and it says you can disable it and you cant
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I try to read this book at least once a year. My favorite book. Go read it. I think you'll like it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game, very entertaining. Excellent when you just don't know what to do. I'm using a T-mobile MyTouch 4G and it work without a flaw.

B0063IH60K|5.0|basic solitaire...simple and easy to use...change scoring between Vegas and standard...one card or three card draw...layout changes vertical or horizontal....when not in Vegas scoring, you can change your deal from random, winning, or repeat...I love solitaire on the computer and grew up playing it with actual cards...now I can take it everywhere with out mess or hassle for a great price
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy the scenery, and story. I love playing mahjong.  this game has kept me entertained for hours, and I'm not even finished. I hope to have a few months at least, of fun with this great app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible is outstanding!  I love that I can download bibles to read offline.and especially love the devotional/bible plans! This little app. packs a lot of punch!!  In addition, it gives you a friendly email letting you know of your 'purchase' ( which is basically welcoming you to your new bible plan) and small reminders if you have missed some days and even how to 'catch up' on your plan.  Received an email today stating a new plan for Lent is now available! Again, for a free app - you can't go wrong!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game this game is totally awesome I'm totally addicted buy things without using actual money is great too
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Clearly Garmin is a name brand with a strong following (particularly the 305 group). One of the guys on the ship (USN) had a 405 and allowed me to check it out... I was quickly won over with the small size and ease of use (once you play with the dial face interaction). Though many of my friends with the 305 swore I would be unhappy with the dial face input, they were wrong... love it! The 405CX takes it a moment or two for the satellites to align (again new to the GPS aspect), otherwise the cat's meow of running watches in my mind; specifically compared to numerous others I have observed (several running friends tracked our progress via similar devices).  I must admit I was a little uncomfortable with all the data available on the software (via the wireless connection) in the beginning but now it's nice to look at the grafts and measures of my effectiveness (you can't hide a bad stretch with this thing).  Averaging 15-20 miles a week and I'm getting the itch to do more!  Very (Very) pleased with this product specifically how it is benefiting my understanding of or desire for running...  Have a fine Navy day! r/Scott

0385342063|4.0|I've read all of the novels written by Sophie Kinsella. Her books are always great fun with somewhat flighty heroines who embody the term 'to err is human'. The fact that as a reader you feel your heart strings rooting for them makes their ultimate triumphs divine.<br /><br />I've Got Your Number fits this formula. It's the tale of a young woman named Poppy. She's recently gotten engaged to the 'perfect man' who is handsome, intelligent and madly in love with her. Everything is perfect. Until she loses her engagement ring which was a family heirloom from her fiance's family. Then her phone gets stolen and all hell breaks lose. Lucky for Poppy, she finds a cell phone in a trash bin and is able to use it for friends, family and anyone who might know the whereabouts of her ring to contact her. Unfortunately for Poppy, the phone's previous owner threw away a company phone and her boss, Sam, wants to get it back from Poppy.<br /><br />This is where the plot gets interesting as Poppy starts communicating frequently with Sam, reading his private emails and sometimes interfering in his personal affairs.<br /><br />The adventures, mishaps and chuckles throughout the book are highly entertaining and cement the fact that Kinsella is a leader in the chick lit genre.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Kind of frustrating at times, but that's what keeps me going!  Really good for killing time and making you think at the same time.
0307956350|3.0|I enjoyed the story of \\"The Expats\\" but the author jumps around a lot with the timeline and I found that to be very confusing. The story starts out at \\"Today\\" then jumps back 2 years, then 20 years, then forward in time, and so on until concluding with \\"Today\\" again. This is a very engrossing story of espionage and intrigue, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing, as any good suspense thriller should. The story was absorbing and the characters very well drawn and interesting. Author Chris Pavone does a great job of setting the mood and scene, and it is nice to read an espionage thriller that features a woman as the central character. I defintely would have given this book 4 stars if not for the confusing timeline.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app. Wish it was a little faster and more accurate but hopefully with updates that will happen but I'm using it with my kindle fire and I have no major complaints.I give this app 5 stars
B005HSL626|5.0|I think this is a fun game to play.I always play it on my dad's phone.relly it is a fun game....to...PlAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played! It is soooo addicting! I would recommend this book 2 anyone who loves fun.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Anyone who is a Twilight fan has to buy this movie and add to your collection. Have seen all the saga so had to add to my collection. Gets a little cheesy at times but the love story line is worth watching.  We all want to see where EDWARD and BELLA are going and where they will end up.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game really enjoy it much better than that other one that  sticks all the time. NOT FOND OF REVIEW THAT MAKES. ONE WRITE. 20 OR MORE WORDS THO. SEEMS LIKE FISHING TO ME.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|i like it. but i think it could be organized better. like showing the instructions before you play the game would be nice.
0316056863|5.0|I looooved this audio book! I have a friend who reads biographies and memoirs like it's her job. They're her favorite genre. And when I told her I had downloaded this book she was a little \\"Meh\\". She hadn't loved the physical book. Granted she's a fan of Chelsea Handler and other funny women. So her standard is a bit high.  I'll agree with my friend in that while I was listening I thought to myself \\"This wouldn't be nearly as funny simply reading. I totally would not have read it like that\\" Fey reads her audio book herself. Which enhances the experience like none other. Fey adds asides to her rendition that could not have made it into the print copy.  Case in point:  The Sarah Palin/Hilary Clinton SNL Episode  Fey had the entire audio of the skit in her audiobook. Almost cried from laughter during my run.  As a side note: Do be aware that if you listen to funny things while running/working out in public you will laugh. And others will stare. You'll be ok with this situation however, because it's just so darn funny.  Fey spends quite a bit of time recounting her time as Sarah Palin on SNL as well as the work she's done building 30 Rock. And while I'm not familiar with her 30 Rock show (never could get into it...) this didn't hinder my experience enjoying her thoughts on the experience.  Some of my favorite bits from the audio were of her comments on the image of female beauty in our society. As well as the bit about posing on magazine covers and the part when she speaks of elitest breastfeeding mothers. Tears, I promise tears from laughter.  I would suggest this audio book to any woman looking for a good laugh. You'll see bits of yourself in this funny woman who seems to have happened upon such fame through hard work and a bit of luck.  Rating: 5/5 Feminist and funny Fey will point out all the issues of being a woman in our society and poke fun at them in a way that is utterly accessible.
B001ER4CTI|5.0|For the price for all this it was a great but. Good movie and extra stuff are cool. Only negative is digital copy coupon expired

1451627289|5.0|A brilliant book! King really delivers in terms of plot and intrigue - I couldn't put it down and was haunted by Jake and Sadie's ill-fated romance long after reading the last page. I found the whole concept of going back in time and trying to change a crucial event in history fascinating - who hasn't ever wondered what would happen if we could change one little event in our past, and how our life would be changed. King also really captures the atmosphere of the late 50's and early 60's, so well that you can almost taste, smell and feel the towns and people Jake encounters on his journey. The butterfly effect is well thought out and gives room for thought, and Jake's efforts in doing the right thing are endearing and make you want to keep reading to see what happens. I also loved King's writing style, which is alive and flowing well - this book will go into my list of favourite reads to revisit again one day. Loved it!
B006ON41FC|4.0|it was good not great though. it is a lot of fun/ but the graffics are not the best. I say four stars.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|The property of Jesus song is a complaint about people who have something better than the belonging which is claimed by religion:<br /><br />You've got a heart of stone.<br /><br />I have tried to sing most of the songs on all four discs of this Amnesty International collection of songs by Bob Dylan, and listening frequently reminds me of lines that I have forgotten in songs like The Changing of the Guard which I neglected to memorize. New Morning is a song that I have hardly ever listened to, from the same album which had If Not For You, which reminds me of George Harrison singing I'd Have You Anytime, and anyone who thinks I am being obscure has been living a different kind of life.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Started out pretty easy.  But I was extremely suprised at how difficult the game becomes as you progress.  very addictive and frustrating together equals a great game.  no problems on motorola defy and kindle fire.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun times, good graphics for a mahjong game, easy levels. good game to pass the time, quite relaxing. tiles are easy to read.

B004G600A4|5.0|Ever have a problem finding something the whole family will enjoy watching? If you're like me you have one child that likes magic and scary monsters (but not too scary) and the other likes animals, Dad likes action and adventure, Gran likes romance and me I just like to laugh. Then Tangled is the movie for you, it had it all, plenty of action and adventure a horse named Max who made me laugh out loud, a sweet romance, magic and a scary monster called \\"Mother\\". Add funny, silly and sweet music, beautiful animation and a wonderful adaptation of an old Fairy Tale and you've got a real gem.  Note: if you have a very sensitive child \\"Mother\\" might be too scary for them as she is really mean and verbally abusive (no bad language but hurtful).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am waiting on a lung transplant and was mad at the world, why me. Then I remembered my Mother went thru the same thing. She had emphysema too and probably COPD too, but at the time they didn't know the name of it, she passed away in 1964. There weren't transplanted then, thank God they have come a long way.Mom passed away before her children grew up. I have grandchildren and thanks to God I will probably get to see them grow up. So I read the Bible everyday or listen to it. I have renewed my faith and this app makes it easier for me to read or listen to the Bible everyday. Thank you!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Very Fun app. Easy to play. I really like earning the artifacts. The only thing I don't like is there is no multiplayer mode. Would love to play in a non-solitaire mode sometimes but other than that, it's a great app.
B006ON41FC|1.0|WONT STOP ASKING ME TO RATE IT EVEN IF I. JUST TURN OFF THE SCREEN WHILE PAUSED. ALSO, TOO REPETITIVE.
B006ON41FC|4.0|it's fun, but wish I could change the goals on my own, other than that controlling a squirrel is awesome
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I red reviews on this before I made the purchase, and honestly this headset deffinitly lives up to its hype. Whether its Call of Duty, Madden or Assasains Creed, the live action in my ears is incredible. I can actually hear the enemy's feet crunch on the broken glass and gravel as they charge at me in COD:MW3. It sounds like I'm right there in the game as bullets whiz by my head and my team coordinate through their headsets to take out the enemy fast and efficiently, just like in real life. I hear the hits up close and personal as I sack the QB for a fourth down conversion late in the third quarter as the pressure mounts. I can almost feel the sweat of the players as their bodies burn.  5 stars across the board. Phenominal product. Worth the cash.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app so much. The games are addicting and I honestly love playing. They really suck me in.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app stopped me from.Bing any Mrs apps cuz I was so occupied with the 101 games! only downside u have to unlock some of the games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it, this app is installed on my kindle fire and cellphone. The translations are so wonderful, and the daily devotions rock.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Thanks amazon for a good free app of the day. Playing tell the battery is dead. if you love mahjong you will love this.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|It is the first mahjong game I have played and it is really good.  It has funny symbols of mahjong for countries other than China. The gaming and bonus systems are also very good.  The game itself worth 5 stars.  However, this is a paid game, why do you always show the ads (or news if you insist) about other G5 games, even when using the mobile network?  And I cannot turn it off by any means.  It used more than 200KB data in each launch, while the ads/news are shown in the first screen, so you cannot skip it if you want to play the game.  So I would give it 2 stars as it is extremely unfriendly to those users with small data plan.  Either make the game free or remove the ads in the launching screen will make it a good game.
030788743X|5.0|I pretty much loved everything about this book.  I listened to this book on audio, imagine my surprise when I realized that this was narrated by Will Wheaton (I just listened to Fuzzy Nation a couple weeks ago which was also narrated by Will Wheaton) and he again did an absolutely stellar job of narrating.  This book is so fun and is really a kick to read if you were ever interested in, or part of, 80's geek culture.  It also has a strong cyperpunk feel to it; so fans of cyberpunk should also considering checking this book out.<br /><br />Wade lives in 2044 and the future is bleak, power shortages have most of humanity struggling and out of work.  So most of humanity live their lives in the OASIS; a virtual reality creaked by James Halliday that consists of thousands of worlds.  This is where Wade goes to school, where he plays, and where he is raised.  When Halliday dies he leaves the ultimate puzzle/lottery behind.  Halliday has hidden an Easter Egg in the OASIS and whoever finds it will win Halliday's substantial fortune.  Wade is one of many Gunters (egg hunters) who has spent years searching for the prize.  When Wade stumbles on a clue that leads him to the first key his life is changed forever.<br /><br />Did you grow up in the 80's?  Do you love games of all types?  If so this is the book for you.  This book basically is everything 80's geek culture could ever ask for.  There are references to numerous 80's video games in here: Joust, Golden Ax, PacMan, Zork, and many others.  As well as references to 80's movies, music, TV shows, etc.  All of this is wrapped into a quest to find three keys, conquer three gates and win the prize.  So there is a bit of a classic Dungeons and Dragons feel to the book as well.  But this is DnD with a cyber punk twist.  Certain worlds will allow magic, and others tech, but chaos regions allow for both creating some truly mind-blowing scenes involving magic, guns, and lasers.  The amount of awesome 80's trivia in this book is incredible; Cline definitely put a ton of research into writing this book.<br /><br />This isn't just a geek fest, there is a lot to think about in this book too.  Wade's closest friends are people he's never meet in person.  Wade also spends a very small amount of time in the real world; his body is mearly a piece of equipment that he keeps exercised and fed so that he can jack in to the OASIS.  This brings up questions about what it means to live; do we need to do things in person for them to be real and fulfilling?  As you learn more about the genius that is Halliday this question comes to a head; was he happy with his creation or did he regret his lack of interaction with other humans?<br /><br />Then there is the evil corporation that has hired people to play in the OASIS for them; this group of OASIS players is known as the sixers and they do everything in their power to win Halliday's Easter Egg.  The sixers are basically everything corporate that Halliday hated.  With the Gunters going against the Sixers you have a classic story about the normal everyday man facing off against the evil corporation.<br /><br />As Wade and his friends make more progress towards finding the Easter Egg consequences start to leak out of the OASIS into the real world and people start dying.  It becomes less and less clear where the OASIS ends and the real world begins.<br /><br />The characters in this book are awesome; they are all so real and fun to read about.  The story is absolutely engaging, it is pretty quest based so that is the main driver...but as the story continues it becomes more and more compelling and impossible to put down.<br /><br />All in all this book was an absolute blast to read.  It was a fun read for someone like me who loves gaming of all types, it provided some great food for thought, it was funny and heartwarming, full of great action scenes and completely engaging.  I highly recommend this book.  My only caution would be if you do not like gaming and do notknow anything about 80's culture then a lot of this book is going to go right over your head.  A lot of the negative reviews for this book are from people who don't like gaming or just don't get it.  So, uh, seriously if you don't like gaming why are you are reading a cyberpunk fantasy novel about 80's gaming culture called Ready Player One!?<br /><br />Highly recommended, an absolute blast to read, I can't wait to see what Cline comes up with next.go right over your head.

0375869026|4.0|They say if you want to win an Oscar you need to play somebody with an extreme personal difficulty (terminal illness, disease, etc.).  They do not, for the record, say that about award winning children's books.  There isn't this general understanding that if you want a shiny Newbery Medal on your cover then you need to give your main character autism or a cleft palate or any of that.  People write such books but if I were to make a very rough estimate I'd say that a good 90% of them were awful.  Why say such a thing?  Because when you have a child character facing life with a significant problem on their plate it's hard to present your story in such a way where the audience isn't just another gawker.  You need windows and mirrors.  To look into a person's mind and see someone like yourself (mirror) but to also look through your own eyes and see someone who has experiences you'll never have (window).  This balancing act often topples lesser authors, leaving flawed books with grand intentions.  Read enough of them and you get jaded and just automatically assume that the next one you pick up will be the same.  So I picked up \\"Wonder\\" by R.J. Palacio with skepticism on my mind.  And like its hero August Pullman, nothing about it was the same.  I mean that in the best way possible.<br /><br />Auggie Pullman has never had to go to school with other kids.  Lucky him you say?  Not so much.  You see, Auggie's a great kid.  Loves his Star Wars and his Xbox and all the other stuff kids are into.  He also has had more surgeries than most people go through in an entire lifetime, and he's only in the fifth grade.  Born with severe birth defects that have rendered his face very different from that of other kids he's been homeschooled for years.  Now, at long last, he has a chance to go to a small school near his home for the first time.  He's always had to deal with people treating him differently.  The real question is whether or not he can get them to look beyond his face to see how he's just the most ordinary kid you ever did know.<br /><br />The writing is good in a rather direct way.  Some children's authors can load a page with lines that cause you to stop and think and ponder for days at a time.  Not surprisingly, their books are fulfilling but make for slow reading.  Palacio's talent lies in pulling her audience along quickly, then spotting the story with small pinpoints of insight.  A child reading the book is interested right from the start and will easily swallow smart lines like \\"Jack, sometimes you don't have to be mean to hurt someone.\\"  The book does slow down from time to time (during Justin's section most notably, though I'll get to that later) but overall it flows beautifully.<br /><br />They say that one of the most common stories you can tell is \\"a stranger comes to town\\".  \\"Wonder\\" was interesting because when tales like this one are told in middle grade novels, the narrator is inevitably one of the crowd.  A Nick Carraway to the hero Gatsby.  Think of novels like \\"[[ASIN:0440416779 Stargirl]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:0316011703 Firegirl]]\\", or \\"[[ASIN:0525477268 Larger-Than-Life Lara]]\\".  In each case you're with the crowd outside of the hero, watching.  Palacio tries something a little risky with her novel.  You start out in Auggie's head at the beginning.  Then, as the story progresses, she leaps into the heads of others.  From Auggie to his sister Via. From Via to schoolmate Summer.  Summer to Jack, Jack to Justin, Justin to Auggie again, Auggie to Miranda, Miranda back to Auggie at last.  It's interesting.  I would have expected the leaps of p.o.v. to be relegated solely to the center of the book.  Instead, that leap from Justin to Auggie to Miranda to Auggie is interesting.  You don't see Miranda coming, and I wondered for a moment why it was there.  My thinking was that the novel needed to get into the head of a couple of its \\"villains\\".  So you get to see what Jack was thinking when he was mean and what Miranda was dealing withwhen dissing Via.  I half expected the brain of the true bad guy of the book, Julian, to make an appearance but no such luck.  Each of these moments work pretty well.  Someone once asked me to name a truly great children's book that switches its p.o.v. and though I couldn't name one I knew it was not impossible.  The only character I would take out would be Via's boyfriend Justin.  His section is perfectly nice but its sole point, insofar as I could tell, was to show why Julian eventually claims that Jack hired a hit man to threaten him.  Other than that, it comes right out.<br /><br />Other choices in the novel struck my fancy as well.  The book begins by almost making a point of not describing Auggie's face when you're in Auggie's head.  He simply mentions his looks with a dismissive, \\"I won't describe what I look like.  Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\\"  I liked that.  You actually get a pretty good approximation of Auggie's face anyway, just due to the fact that he has to mention parts of it when describing why eating can be a problem, why his ears are difficult, etc.  I was a little disappointed then when we got to Via's section and she lays Auggie's looks on the line.  I understand why Palacio did it, of course.  You sort of need to know what you're dealing with so as to understand/condemn the kids that understand/condemn Auggie.  It's very interesting that it happens on page 88, though.  If I were doing this book with a kids' bookclub, I'd ask them why they thought the author waited so long.  I bet the answers could prove eye-opening.<br /><br />The story seems to take place in a little alternative New York City.  There's still an A train but there are also locations that don't quite exist like the Berkeley Heights area of upper Manhattan. In that little manmade sphere Palacio can drop in her characters and situations, some of which I've never seen before.  For example, I liked that Palacio showed how adults could be just as cruel and insensitive as kids (ex: Photoshopping Auggie out of the class photo and then handing out copies).  I liked that Palacio made a point of showing that mean people aren't necessarily bad people.  And I was particularly fond of the ending.  I had the worry that the book would try to show the community coming together for Auggie in a false way, but the reason the kids in his school start sticking up for him rang true to me.  We won't get into it, suffice to say that it's a lot more believable than the endings I've read in some other books.  I was admittedly a little disappointed when Julian, our resident villain, disappears from the book and, with him, all conflict goes too.  Still, it's a quibble.<br /><br />I worry a little that the novel will suffer in time due to the sheer number of contemporary references that pepper its pages.  Be ready for some Star Wars because Palacio delves into that world with gusto.  Heck, whole plot turns depend on it.  On top of that you'll find references to Justin Bieber, The Simpsons, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (there's an excellent explanation of \\"The Cheese Touch\\" here), Jimmy Neutron, Christina Aguilera, etc.  My hope is that this will just mean that the book becomes a kind of historical document in the future, but my worry is that in the interim, say ten years from now, it'll be considered instantly lame by the kids who find all these outdated references strange (except the Diary of a Wimpy Kid part . . . that's forever!).  I shouldn't have been surprised to find them, of course, when from the outset it was clear that the book was based on a Natalie Merchant song (which has been playing on a loop in my brain for the past two weeks or so).  And I'll forgive a lot from a book that quotes a Magnetic Fields song at length within the text.<br /><br />Heart.  Which is to say, writing books with heart.  It's a talent.  Some might say that the easy route is to write a book with a character like Auggie but I am of the opinion that an author actually makestheir own job incredibly difficult if they follow Palacio's path.  You could end up with something saccharine or that just feels off in tone.  You could wind up ironic and bitter or so sugary sweet that no child will believe in your hero.  You could weigh the narrative down with \\"lessons\\" that chafe or you could eschew the lessons entirely and have a book without a moral compass or point.  Palacio navigates all these tricky areas and manages to come out with a story that is not only good, not only heartfeld, not only well-written, but something you actually want to return to after you've put it down.  She's figured out how to write characters that feel so real you might know them yourself.  So even if you don't think this is the book for you, fear not.  What we have here is a winner.

0307593312|1.0|The name is punny.  Get it, because the word for the number nine in Japanese is pronounced \\"Q.\\"  It doesn't really have much to do with Orwell's 1984 though, so I am not sure why he went with that title.  It may had made more sense to use a different but adjacent year to avoid comparisons.  The title, although punny, is just one example of poor forethought on this book though.<br /><br />I generally love Murakami's books.  Well not including the last three.  Kafka on the shore wasn't horrible, but it just came off as completely pretentious.  What I Talk About When I Talk About Running was completely pretentious and not very enjoyable at all.  I will summarize that one.  Murakami is better than you and knows more than doctors, when he tries hard he can do anything including running marathons while battling pneumonia and hooked up to a respirator after having both lungs removed (yeah he can even have pneumonia with both lungs removed).  Wait this is a review for 1Q84.<br /><br />This book is a hot mess.  Did Murakami edit this himself; maybe the day after he wrote it.  This was supposed to be his opus and I guess no one wanted to tell him that his signature piece was deeply flawed.  Well onto the flaws I guess.<br /><br />The translation sucks.  It is translated by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel.  The fact that it took two people to translate it says a lot to me.  Gabriel translated Kafka on the Shore, which I also thought had problems.  He seems to do direct translation of puns and idioms.  Rubin has translated my favorite Murakami books, so maybe he wasn't too involved.<br /><br />The book was too long.  For fun, I thought I would look for the longest book on my Kindle.  Oh look there is the Count of Monte Cristo that has to be it, right?  Nope, a bit further down beating it by like three dots, was 1Q84.  Not that long books aren't good.  The Stand is a favorite and I enjoyed the heck out of the Count of Monte Cristo.  But this book has a tendency to repeat the same things over and over.  I get it, Aomame's face looks scary when she is angry and Fuka Eri talks funny.  Please stop hitting me over the head with it.<br /><br />There is no climax.  As usual, in a Murakami story, several of the characters do, but the story just never hits a high point.  I think any part that could have been a high point is weighed down with over philosophizing and self actualization.  Tengo and Aomame meeting should have been huge, but it just kind of sputters.  Aomame and the leader should have been great but apparently everyone in Japan talks in riddles and no one asks direct questions.  Either way, What felt like buildup towards a climax, never really climaxes.  We only get halfway up that hill before Murakami decides to take us around the long way.<br /><br />Unresolved plot threads.  This story develops characters and makes them central to the story, until they aren't and then it abandon's them to never be seen or heard from again.  At the end, you hardly no more about anything than you did at the end.  What happens to those two Sakigake guys, the dowager, Fuka Eri, or even the little people.<br /><br />Pedophilia.  Murakami has danced around this one in the past.  I am looking at you Wind up Bird.  Kafka has a younger man/older woman dynamic that society seems to find more acceptable, but 1Q84 has men sleeping with underage girls all over the place.  It is explained away but comes across as excuses so that Murakami could include these scenes that he obviously has always wanted to write.  But hey Tengo was paralyzed, so that makes it okay.  Not to mention that someone slipped Aomame a mickey, or it at least seemed that way.<br /><br />Tengo is superman.  Tengo is perfect.  He can cook, he is clean, he is a brilliant mathematician and teacher, he lives frugally, he doesn't watch TV, he is excellent at Judo, he is a great writer, he is a stud that woo anything female, he is an excellent musician that can learn an instrument in a week and then playcomplicated pieces of music at a concert the following week to great acclaim.  All this and the whole time you are reading him, he comes off as mildly retarded.  The character is completely unrealistic.  Aomame and Fuka Eri seem to be fantasies of what Murakami thinks the perfect women would be.<br /><br />Overall-This book was in serious need of an editor and took over a month and a half for me to read. It would often put me to sleep and at one point I just started scanning past paragraphs of inner dialogue at a time.  There are at least two points when the perspective of the novel changes mid chapter, which pulled me right out of the book.  Is there an interesting book in here, maybe, but you would have to go after what we were presented with an axe to find it.  Any of the flaws I found in of themselves wouldn't completely ruin a book, but put them together and I find it impossible to recommend this book.  It felt like a waste of the large amount of time that I spent reading it.  Don't read this book.  Read Wind Up Bird Chronicles thrice or Norwegian Wood four to five times instead.  This one sucked.complicated pieces of music at a concert the following week to great acclaim.  All this and the whole time you are reading him, he comes off as mildly retarded.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|Fun game to give your brain a little exercise. Some of the things are quite challenging,others are easier. It's actually quite additive at first,I love to play this game. I think it would be a little difficult for young children,but great for older kids and adults alike. I recommend this game to anyone looking for something to pass time,yet it's not a waste of time because it does make you think and lets you improve how quickly you respond to various situations in the game.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|So I got this headset for Xmas from my brother. I cant complain since it was free but its somewhat annoying. First off, if you expect to get GREAT sound, youll be dissapointed. It does route all the game and chat sounds to your ears (so as to mute your tv, so as to not wake up your roomate or disturb the neighbors) but isnt as high quality as you would expect. I own every system and a PC so had plans to use this headset with joy and delight, but sadly wasnt the case.  Every other night or so Ill play COD with coworkers of mine usually around 10p or so. I use them to not wake up my wife. First off when you put them on they feel like the same old analog headsets they would put on you to give you a hearing test back in elementary school (the one where you would hear a beep on one side and have to point with your finger which ear it was to the person administering the test) yea, exactly like that.  When you try talking to soemone in the room or even the game its hard to measure at what volume you're speaking at. Sounds like your underwater/muffled so I might speaking speaking mildly loud to my wife or mother even though they are only two feet or so away from me. This also affects you when chatting with your friends. Theyll tell you you're too loud or to move mic away from your face.  Another thing about these headphones are the cables. If you just stick straight to your tv, and dont mind a few cables I guess you should be ok, but to me they are somewhat annoying. They are fairly thick. And Since I have every gaming console and an HDTV, Stereo, etc its annoying. If you have the old XBOX 360's you will need to own or buy a COMPONENT cable (hooks into regular hookup, not HDMI hookup) and has a Fiber optic hookup and a red&white AV hookup. Thats where I stick it in for my XBOX. (the new XBOX slims dont need that adapter so is less annoying). If you're gonna livechat with your party/teammates theres an additional cable you need to hookup to your controller. The audio soundsthe same as if it would come out from your tv speaker (not so digital). I admit you do hear \\"footsteps\\" and other ambient noises clearer but isnt as great as you would assume.  For a PS3 you will need to have the original component connection that was included with your ps3 and hook it up through there. If you have only a PS3 I would reccomend getting just the PS3 Official[[ASIN:B0053OLY9O Wireless Stereo Headset]].You might spend a few more bucks but at least theres no cables and is a solid product and gets decent audio. (To me the PX21 is more of an XBOX headset than PS3)  And for those of you with dogs, cats, etc. If they have a tendency to chew, they will chew on the cables. They are 6ft long or so and pretty soft. thatll be $60+ down the drain.  In short, if you can get the wireless turtle beach version or the official PS3. Its too anoying to live with. If you have no rowdy pets or mind cables (or simply cant spend the extra $) then go for it, but dont expect amazing quality. It will meet your bare bone needs. They havent failed me yet but they do become an eyesore.

I have to say that I have made some of the changes based on the first few pages on the book and when I follow exactly how it says I start feeling the results. Since I havent read the full book I know I am probably not doing it right yet. I will add more information when I finish reading the book.

The original Wool is so good that I was slightly let down by Wool 2, but it picks back up and ends up being an amazing overall story.  Wool 2 even becomes more enjoyable as it becomes just a section of the overall story.  An absolute must-read, not just for the sci-fi fans, but for everyone ages 12 and up!  I hope the omnibus never receives anything less than a five star!

B003B02O0U|5.0|I was sceptical about reading a law crime mystery novel thinking I would get lost in the \\"law\\" and while there is law--you don't notice.  The main character and all the \\"law\\" really blends into the story and is explained so that you can not only understand but enjoy it.  It is really amazing the politics--it never ceases to amaze me how decisions can be made not on the basis of what is right or whether it might help someone but on the basis of someone's career--namely a political career.  This book really illustrates it and how they get caught in their own web because of it.  Very thrilling.  I bought it for a friend too.  You will definitely not regret getting hold of this one and reading it!

B0073TZ1AA|2.0|I am a commuter and have countless PDF documents that I need to read. I purchased this hoping it would allow me to listen to them on my drives. It has a lot of potential, it really does. It just lacks in execution.  The voice is awful, in order to get a decent voice, they want you to purchase additional ones at $3--so just as much as the app! The app also does not skip over headers and footers, so be prepared to hear copyright notices read over and over.  This app may be worth buying if they keep developing it up and you wait a few revisions. For now, I would advise just wait until something better comes along. For 99 cents this would be worth it--not for $3.

B00005BHOG|3.0|A fantastic concept (if it would work all the time!!!) completely mechanical/magnetic so you never need batteries. It is activated by the little metal pins on the wheels of the train so it doesn't close the gates when our battery operated plastic locomotive drives past but does when all the wooden wagons pass by. My son started to put a wooden locomotive in front of the battery locomotive to overcome this problem and to get the gates to close as soon as the first part of the train drives past to \\"prevent any accidents\\". :-)  There are two problems with the magnetic system. One is that the gates do not always close and I do not know why. It's more likely to close when there are many wagons and this leads me to the second problem which is that if you have too many wagons and the electric locomotive is moving very slowly, then the magnets tend to catch the wheel and stop the train. This occurs almost always when there are two or three magnetic toys right next to one another. For example if the BRIO Magnetic Bell Signal is built next to the Magnetic Action Crossing then three magnets are working on the train at once and the train gets stuck. But this is not a problem if you're manually pushing the train.  The gates are made of plastic and I'm not sure how long they'll last, hence only 3 stars for durability. The gates can be manually activated and this is a huge plus especially if they don't close automatically when the train passes by, which, as I mentioned earlier, happens quite often.  In spite of all my complaints against the toy I still wouldn't give it back. My 2 yr old son loves it and always integrates it into the network we build. He loves it when the gates shut by themselves when the train passes by and is quite happy to manually shut them if they don't. Therefore I'd say it's still a keeper.

B00004WX4X|5.0|What can be said about Illmatic that hasn't already been said? Well, to make it short its one of the best hiphop albums ever made.  Every track on it is fantastic.  It has some of the best producers in hiphop working on it, and has Nas at his artistic peak. His lyrics are art and sometimes go by you so fast you have to go back and listen to the track again to truly appreciate his expertise at rapping.  His verbal weaponry and delivery come off fast and smooth and you can't help but be stunned with the talent this man has.  If you like rap or hiphop and haven't heard this, you need to get it now! These days the music industry is saturated with phoneys and talentless hacks and mainstream hiphop is 95% garbage.  This album is a 90s staple and captures hiphop in my opinion during it's peak of creativity (1988-1995 or so). What are you waiting for, get Illmatic already!

I do own a Marine handheld Garmin which works okay but wanted an inexpensive backup solution as it's gone out a few times leaving me with a compass and paper chart out in the pacific. What I ended up with is an extensive chartplotter that accurately tracks my location at sea, provides wind, tide, current information and locks onto Satellites very quickly and in areas that my Garmin will not (in my house). For 25 or so bucks I couldn't be happier with my backup solution and in fact find myself using it more than the Garmin now as it really does have a strong receiver and it's waterproof. If you're looking for a strong little GPS receiver this is the ticket.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|When Paul McCartney released \\"McCartney,\\" his first official solo album in 1970, it was not well received by fans or critics.  The record was intentionally raw, stripped down, and sparsely produced.  As such, it came across as a collection of demos that weren't good enough to be considered Beatles songs.  Personally, I disagree, and this reissue of \\"McCartney\\" gives fans a chance to rediscover the album.<br /><br />What I think confuses the average listener are the many instrumentals and short throwaway snippets that litter the album tracks, and appear to be filler.  To me, they're wonderful, for they reflect the essence of McCartney's song writing.  Remember, it was a brief, albeit brilliant, McCartney fragment that became the middle section in the classic Lennon composition, \\"A Day In A Life.\\"<br /><br />Many of the songs on \\"McCartney,\\" would have been considered great Beatle tunes had they been on Beatle's albums.  \\"Every Night,\\" for instance, would have been a fine track on either \\"Rubber Soul\\" or \\"Revolver,\\" just as \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" would have fit perfectly on \\"Let It Be.\\"  I can easily picture \\"Oo You\\" and \\"Teddy Boy\\" (sung by Ringo, of course), on The White Album.  In fact, \\"That Would Be Something\\" is a great companion piece to \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\"  And the sweet lilting melody of \\"Junk\\" is classic McCartney in the tradition of \\"Blackbird\\" or \\"Yesterday.\\"<br /><br />What prevents these songs from reaching their peak is the lack of creative contributions from the other three Beatles, or any musicians for that matter.  The absence of Lennon, Harrison, and Starr is jarring.  It's painfully obvious how much McCartney relied upon his old band mates, as well as George Martin, to give his songs depth.  His decision to play all the instruments and produce the album himself might have been cathartic at the time, but it probably wasn't the wisest, for it created a singular view and made the project appear to be one giant ego trip.<br /><br />Fortunately, this reissue lets us hear Paul McCartney jamming his ass off.  Just one listen and there's no doubt this man is an intense energetic rock-and-roller.  The CD booklet comes with the lyrics and lots of photographs.  The bonus CD doesn't reveal any surprises, other than a full-length version of the morbid, \\"Suicide,\\" and the equally dismal, \\"Women Kind.\\"  But the real gem here is the remastered original album.<br /><br />Linda McCartney's fabulous album cover says it all.  Life is a bowl of spilled cherries.  I give McCartney credit for persevering after the breakup of the world's greatest rock band, and for trying something different.  But I've always wondered what these songs could have become.ney jamming his ass off.  Just one listen and there's no doubt this man is an intense energetic rock-and-roller.

B006C1DH92|3.0|I was excited to try Fruit Ninja &amp; I love PIB so when this was FAOTD I figured a double bonus. But while playing the app freezes for a second &amp; is unresponsive.

B0059XTUEK|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when I went to see this movie in the theatre, but as I started watching it I became totally engrossed. Throughout the movie I laughed and also teared up at the deeply tragic side of Marilyn Monroe seemingly trying to decipher real life from her character used throughout her movies. When the movie ended, no one in the theatre moved for a while and there was a quiet awe of the movie. Any doubt that I had in Michelle Williams acting abilities were diminished when I saw how completely she played the role of the \\"real\\" Marilyn Monroe. I could watch this movie multiple times.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|I didn't find out that this album existed until it had been out for seven months or so.  I was practically salivating when I popped this one in my CD player and...well, the best way I can describe the experience is: like having something that looks like a cookie in your hand-I mean everything-the shape, texture, the wrapping-and popping it into your mouth, expecting it to taste like a sweet and delicious cookie-only for it to be a cracker.  Honestly, it's a damn good cracker but nevertheless, its still a cracker and if you were expecting for it to taste like a cookie-it dosn't matter how good of a cracker it is because you will be disappointed.  After eating that cracker many times now I can finally judge the album for what it is instead of what I was expecting it to be.  Furthermore, after careful analysis, one will find those redeeming qualities of his first album subtly interwoven into the broad orchestrations used in this album.  To prove my point I am going to refer to Bon Iver's sessions at AIR studios, which are available for listening on youtube.  In these sessions he strips down several of the songs from this album to their bare bones: piano and vicals. Compare the songs in this session to the studio versions and you will hear that Bon Iver retains his musical essence but expresses it within a radically contradictory way: call it an overproduced and synthetic musical facade. The real heart of the album lies in Bon Iver's usage of dramatic irony.  Therefore, all of the brilliant musical qualities contained within For Emma are still there: most notably, the intimacy.  While this album may not be quite as pornographic as For Emma it is still brilliant and its melodies haunting and infectious.

0345457692|5.0|This is one of the most thought-provoking novels I've read in years. The concept of \\"sleeves\\" is brilliantly executed, and raises questions about the nature of selfhood. The writing is taut, the characters are fresh and individual, and the plot combines the best of sf and noir. Oh, and the action rocks, too!
B006YXTRHY|1.0|I love True Blood, Vampire Diaries, and many other vampire movies and series, but for the life of me I cannot like this movie.  It's pathetic.  The acting is at most, marginal, but the wolf isn't that bad.  At least he's trying.  But the two main characters are so stilted, wooden, and bland, it kills the movie.  Save your money and just read the book.

B0059XTUMC|3.0|This movie is an OK watch. But I had expected something like a work of genius. Something which really reinvented the silent movie. This movie is actually just an ordinary quality movie which is silent. I think there is an interesting development potential in silent movies for contemporary directors. It could be interesting if some more talented directors tried their hand at this, because silent movies actually have something which talkies does not have. I think the movie is supposed to be a love story? Hm... I didn't really notice that :-( The male lead is good, but I didn't like the female lead, I think she overacts with a lot of stupid gestures.
B003U55J9Y|2.0|honestly it seemed like they threw the ending together without any thought or planning.  so many questions left unanswered, holes left unfilled.  such a disappointing ending to what started out as such a great series.  Not worth even finishing. . .
B000CEAGH6|5.0|It is a cute little dino.  My son loves to hold this dino and the triceratops I got in him and make them roar at each other.  It's nice to have toys that don't light up and make the sounds for them.  It seems sturdy and well made.  It is rather small but I knew that going into it.  I bought him two dino's to start with and I plan on adding to them over time since they are such good quality.

B0042RUMJG|3.0|Orchestra FANTASTIC  Arrangments FANTASTIC  Sound qualitz COULD BE BETTER  Subtitles NO (and you will need it too)  Single along - NEGATIVE  Sting as a singer - he is not.  Conductor - jumps and performatics to be seen are too mainstream... old business - he is too good to need it. I dont know why he did it.  It is a concert that you can listen to while doing something else. I was expecting to be mesmerized by the concert but was not.  I watched the blu ray 3 times to give this opinion.  Looks like a tribute to Sting... not a show to fans...  Sorry... the praises on other comments are ok, but I didnt feel I could follow them.  3 GOOD STARS  All the best
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this version of mahjong tiles.  I have played many different versiins and this one is the most fun and has the best graphics and animations.  They have also included some interesting new tiles that have different effects.  Bravo on creating such a fun game.  I can easily overlook their ads for their other games.
0439023513|3.0|This is a fantastic, daring, thought-provoking series. But as a finale, I felt that Mockingjay fell a tad bit short. The first two parts of the book are slow, random, and a little tedious - while we get a good look inside Katniss' mind, everything just seems to be a little stagnant for a long time. Any end to the war seems a long ways off. Then, the third part arrives, and it seems like Collins has realized that her precise formula to writing these novels has left her with little time to wrap everything up. Her solution? Rapidly kill off a shocking amount of key characters in increasingly bizarre ways, drop any descriptiveness in favor of surreal bluntness, give surviving characters half-resolutions that make no sense with what we've come to know about them over the course of the trilogy, and wrap everything up in a way that makes you think, \\"Okay . . . yeah, but . . . wait, what?\\"    The book is still decent, and still compulsively readable. But the series was building to such incredible heights - I just feel like so much more could have been done with this as a finale. A finale should tie up loose ends, and give readers a sense of closure as they finish the last page. Although Mockingjay is good, it denies readers that closure.
B004SBX112|2.0|I don't like it its really bad I hate it hate hate hate it but the game its self is okay

B0071XO8RA|5.0|As an avid SciFi reader for over forty years, I've read them all - Campbell, Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, and more recently Card and Sawyer.  The Wool stories rank right up there with the very best.  Right from the start you don't feel like you're reading a fantasy or fiction story, you are transported to a new reality with a real world, real characters, and real situations.  And it is not a story you are done with when you finish - it stays with you, I'm guessing for a very long time.  I highly recommend reading Wool whether you are a SciFi fan or just want an excellent story.  You will not be disappointed! As I write this review there are 47 out of 47 five-star reviews; there is good reason for that!
B003L7DK6U|5.0|In general, I like movies that are extended edition, unfortunately I like Enter the Dragon better in it's theatrical edition.  Most movies that were released multiple times normally included extended and theatrical versions but not in the case of ETD.  ETD Blu Ray was first released on 17 April 2007 and then again on 15 Jul 2010 but no theatrical edition either.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is really really fun with all the different challenges and goals. there is nothing I would change at all.
B000069HZP|2.0|I will get out in the open that I consider David Fincher one of the freshest and more mature voices of this generation of film directors.  He is a marvelous storyteller and he understands how to mesh style with substance in remarkable ways.<br /><br />Sadly, `The Game' is easily his weakest effort.<br /><br />Really, `The Game' fails in areas outside of the direction, which is very well orchestrated despite the film's many limitations.  The tension is amicable and reminds me a lower end De Palma film actually; a little copy-cattish and not at all original but effective for the most part.  Michael Douglas is always adept to playing a self-absorbed business man, and he nails that side of character with ease, but he also grapples with the growing panic and eventual paranoia of his character very well.  I'll admit, I was impressed, especially since I consider Douglas an actor of minimal range.  The rest of the cast is slightly laughable.  James Rebhorn is awful here and Sean Penn, while utilizing his youthful charisma, is a tad overdone in some scenes (his paranoid breakdown lacks real conviction) and Deborah Kara Unger is about as convincing as a two-by-four.<br /><br />I'll say that the film's biggest asset is easily the production designers who really worked great angles at making this an entrenched thriller.  Those sets are outstanding.<br /><br />But really, the film's ultimate downfall is the ridiculous screenplay.  The film is just a preposterous mess, and while suspension of disbelief is best used in film's like this, the pure ridiculous of the plot itself it just irritating.  I thought that the initial concept seemed intriguing (the whole `hand someone a profound life experience in the form of a game they don't understand but have to play out') but the way in which the script fleshes itself is so full of plot holes and lapses in possibility that it is a complete mess.<br /><br />Skip this; it's dumb.

B000UJ48SQ|4.0|Barry Lyndon represented a huge step forward technically for Kubrick and the film is a masterpiece in many respects. There are scenes in it that are nothing short of majestic in their scope and setting. At times it is like looking at a great painting come to life. The story is a compelling drama based on Thackery's novel. There are moments where the marriage of picture and soundtrack may actually surpass that of any other film I've seen.  Other elements that are superb in this film are the costumes and the supporting cast is a vast and incredibly talented roster of character actors. This is a long film and the pacing may be slow to some but I was completely absorbed watching it recently after a span of almost 35 years since first viewing this when it was released. So why didn't I give this 5 stars ? The acting of the two leads Ryan O'Neil and Maria Berenson was at times quite wooden. They both look great and the period costuming suits each of them perfectly but some of the scenes they share are just a tad flat for me. I understand others will disagree and I don't know who might have been a better choice at the time but if the film has a weakness it is their performances.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|I read all the reviews. Too big, too little. Snug, too snug. Magnet strips, Velcro strips.<br /><br />Here is the rundown:<br /><br />The item I received \\"Timbuk2 Kindle and Kindle Touch ENVELOPE Sleeve Case, Black/Gunmetal/Red\\" fits the Kindle Touch perfectly, snugly (6.8\\" x 4.7\\" x 0.40\\" (172 mm x 120 mm x 10.1 mm)) and is kept securely closed using Velcro strips. You could also bundle the cord with it and stuff it inside but you may risk losing the cord every time you remove your Kindle.<br /><br />The Title of the listing implies that it fits other models as well. If your Kindle Model is bigger than the Kindle Touch (6.8\\" x 4.7\\" x 0.40\\" (172 mm x 120 mm x 10.1 mm)), \\"IT MAY NOT FIT\\". If your Kindle Model is smaller than the Kindle Touch (6.8\\" x 4.7\\" x 0.40\\" (172 mm x 120 mm x 10.1 mm)), \\"IT WILL FEEL LOOSE INSIDE\\".<br /><br />So, if your Kindle doesn't fit the sleeve or it was the wrong color or the sleeve comes any other way than described in it's description, \\"YOU NEED TO RETURN IT\\", not complain about it. Amazon has a wonderful and courteous return Department. I have utilized it and speak from experience.<br /><br />We are very pleased with this product. I hope this review has dispelled some of the negative comments about this product.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|If you're like me you've probably got several different versions of Halloween already. VHS,DVD,collectors disc,etc.<br />So the next thing you might have wondered is if it's worth purchasing on Blu-Ray. I'm here to say the answer is yes!<br />The transfer is amazing.The Audio and video both shine on the Blu-Ray format. One thing I could particluarly notice on the BR version I never could tell much on DVD or VHS is how much Michael Myers grunts,breathes,and moans while stalking around.<br />The special features are on the bare side but their is a nice Halloween documentary which is over an hour long.
B0063GORYU|5.0|As one of my favorite games ever, this is tops for quick play. I love that I can put down my Fire and return hours later and my game is held tod me. As a adult with ADD this is a great tool for practicing focus!

B0007M22TI|5.0|Altho I gave 5 stars, because I love all Celtic Woman, some are better than others.  Check the minutes, especially on CDs.  Also, the sound is better on everything done since 2000 or so.  The best video is the one made at the beautiful castle.  They showed the construction and preparation as a side extra.

B005RYF5JA|3.0|The music is standard American.  Not bad, but not worth buying to hear more of the stuff you hear elsewhere.  Look at other reviews and the contents carefully before deciding.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I was one of those people who saw Lana Del Rey perform on Saturday Night Live, had never heard of her, and thought she did awful. After I decided to research her two songs and saw her videos on YouTube... I thought her songs were actually very good.  Needless to say after buying her album and listening to all her songs, I've found my favorites- Lolita, This Is What Makes Us Girls, and Off to the Races. Her song writing skills are amazing (and yes she actually writes her own songs like a big girl) and her singing is very weird and unique, but I LOVE it!  LOVE THIS ALBUM. Can't wait for her to release another one.
0985081821|5.0|This book was a gift by Rebecca Hamilton herself and I want to thank her for that! But I have to say that the fact that this is a 5-star-review has nothing to do with the fact that the book was a present from the author! I wouldn't write a good review if I didn't really like a book because it's not in my character to do so!  So, back to my review! It's always amazing to find that such a book exists! \\"The Forever Girl\\" is definitely a unique book. I haven't read something like that for a long time! Mysterious and dark, this story has many things to tell and more to imagine.  The way the author writes is very lyrical and I have to admit that too many times while I was reading the book, I thought that I was part of the story. The book is full of images and interesting characters. Nothing is as it seems and the reader has to be very careful not to miss anything. Rebecca Hamilton has create a very mysterious and complex world-building that I enjoyed very much! She took the myth of vampires and shape-shifters in another level and it's very refreshing! It's one of those books that helps the reader's imagination to travel through the story. It was like seeing a movie!  I loved all the characters in the book, even the bad ones, because they're not predictable. Sophia is a young woman and a brave one. Although she is a lonely person it doesn't seem to bother her. This loneliness comes from the fact that she has a secret. She hears voices in her head. And in a small town like the one she lives in, her only choice is to get close with a few people as possible. The fact that she is a Wicca doesn't help much either! I liked her a lot because she doesn't judge people because of their origins. She isn't easily scared and always doing her best under difficult circumstances. I also liked Charles. He is very mysterious at first but his interest for Sophia is more than obvious from the beginning. My opinion is that although he is a very important character in the book sometimes it feels like a secondary. It's not bad at all because this proves that the plot is more important than the romance.  I really enjoyed the writing style of the author. The descriptions, the places, the characters... everything is so well-written that it's impossible not to enjoy this book! Finally, I have to admit that I loved the fact that in the book there is a kind of travel through history, because I am a historian myself!  So, I absolutely recommend this book to all the fans of this genre because it was a great read! I am looking forward for the next one!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Updates on Amazon are few and far between. Most apps I bought or FAOTD'd are at least a few versions behind Google Market, PvZ included. Is this a developer thing, or an Amazon thing? I guess all future purchases will be from Google Market.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey crafts an excellent story and creates a gripping mystery in this series of short stories and novellas. Sort of a meld of the post nuclear tone of the Fallout video games and the post-human hive dwellers of TJ Bass's \\"Half Past Human\\", this story deals with a community of people living in an underground silo some untold years after an unknown event wiped out humanity on the surface. The author never indulges in long exposition, so you are pulled along with the characters as they discover the truth about their unusual living situation.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games is written for teens.  It's fast pace, interesting characters and deeper questions make it interesting for adults as well.  I really liked this book.<br /><br />The story is set in a future North America where devastation and then a failed rebellion have created a world of depravation ruled by a capital center that lives off of the work and bondage of outlying districts.  The Center, as totalitarian states ever have, needs to constantly remind those it rules that it holds the power of life and death over its people and that failure to work within the program is not an option.  It does this by giving its 12 districts somewhat less than subsistence food and support, ensuring that hunger and death are a constant presence in everyday life - particularly for those who do not behave.<br /><br />The Capital also sets the districts against themselves by having an annual Hunger Game.  A boy and a girl chosen from each district must fight to the death within an enclosed park - with the winner getting a year's worth of extra food and supplies for all in their home district.  The annual hunger game is that society's Super Bowl, with the nation literally stopping to watch the televised progression of the child combatants as they kill their way to victory on behalf of their friends, neighbors and fellow district inhabitants.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has created a believable story written at a level that teens will find accessible - yet with a character development, premise and pacing that held my attention and made it a page turner for me.  She creates a lot of sympathy for the main character Katniss Everdeen - one of two hunger games contestants from District 12.  I found myself rooting for her and generally caring about her fate as the book progressed.<br /><br />The book has some violent and gory moments - but in the context in which the author has placed the story they are not gratuitous and are in fact very illustrative of the depravity of the central government.<br /><br />This book has overtones of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"  Centralized and absolute power, totalitarianism and the individual's fight to be the master of his own fate and taste freedom are themes upon which this story is built.

0061992860|5.0|I decided to get the pocket size to keep with me since the original size would be too big and heavy to carry with me while I'm on the go. This is a palm size survival guide that is clear and easy to read if you aren't far sided (can't see close up). Like any small pocket sized book the lettering will be smaller so if you already have a hard time reading normal sized text I'd suggest you purchase a magnify glass to help you out. I plan to keep this little book with me as something to read if I'm waiting and fits perfectly in my purse or backpack without taking up too much space. Overall I am happy with the purchase and for the money spent it well was worth it since it barely cost anything. Item arrived very quickly.
B006MQRLSA|2.0|This movie is another one of his most boring films. I have trouble sleeping and thankfully this film was the best yet to accomplish that most difficult task of sleeping. Rarely an exciting moment, if ever there was one. I normally would've rated this movie a 1 Star for extremely boring and/or dull, but the acting wasn't bad so I had to be fair. I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you're the biggest nerd out there and can stay focused long enough and really, really care that much about baseball.
B001LB1I5S|4.0|I agree with most of the other posts...Very good performance with very good singing, beautiful costumes and sets ( especially the Te Deum at the end of Act l), very good orchestra for a pick up group and excellent sound and video...  Better than most from the same venue.  Not the greatest singing, but very good and an enjoyable production...  Well worth the price asked.You can't go wrong with this one....You could pay a lot more and get a lot less.
B004HYGF18|5.0|To say this album is catchy is an understatement.  The Vaccines seemed to have mastered the art of simplicity- just giving the listener what they want- catchy tunes and sing along lyrics.  The highlights on this album for me are \\"Wetsuit,\\" \\"Wolfpack\\" and \\"Under your thumb.\\"  If you answer the album title and expect to sing along with 3 minute rock riffs that are almost laid out in mathematical fashion, then you will enjoy this record.  Great replayability with this album- if you like Brit-rock you won't be disappointed.  Love this album and I expect big things from the Vaccines.

1400069181|5.0|This was a great personal account about how Blake started TOMS, from the very beginning to the success that they enjoy today. I liked how he was honest about each step of the way and how he really made it work rather than waiting around for someone to give him \\"permission\\" in the form of approval or funding. Started with all heart, continued with kindred spirits and has become a great success! To be honest, I don't own any of the shoes, but I've heard nothing but praise for the company. In an age where the market has been glutted by e-commerce, and with a recent Cinderella story in the shoe industry online (Zappos and Tony Hsieh's Delivering Happiness - another great read, btw), TOMS sold a story along with the non-traditional footwear and has inspired many more to do similarly.  Best piece of advice - you may not be able to pay interns much (or at all), but make sure you feed them well.

0062082353|5.0|What an astounding story. Glad it was put down on paper. We are the luckiest and best country on the planet for a reason. Thank you for your service, Chris. And thanks to your wife for her support, strength and intelligence.  Love the writing style. Just a regular person can follow it. Explains things, but not too much. Some language, but not too  much. There are a couple parts that had me laughing. But  mostly, it was just the truth about it all.  And a reminder to the ********s that bad mouth military! There is a reason why they do what they do! So shut up!

1452650888|5.0|To say this work is \\"mind-boggling\\", falls far too short of the visceral impact it has had on myself, and all those I have urged to read it. I do believe that Life Between Lives Hypno-Regressive Therapy has established a new and unique paradigm for Therapeutic Counseling and Hypnotherapy. Over and above the traditional psycho-therapeutic approach acknowledging Childhood as a primary formative influence in shaping our adult personalities, Journey of Souls reveals the poignant contribution of karmic debt in each of our lives. Whether karma is deemed as good or bad is merely a function of situational contingencies, and subjective semantics; standards applied to one life event may be totally inappropriate in another. While our Childhoods provide ample ground for determining fairly accurate psychological diagnoses, past life regressions and LBL hypnotherapy throw numerous wrenches into the spokes of our psycho-diagnostic wheel. How can a therapist hope to determine why particular phobias surface, when the contributing factors (karma) may be rooted in past lives numbering at times in the hundreds?<br /><br />I have no solution to this psychological dilemma, and I'm fairly certain a single approach to this problem is non-existent. For anyone who is serious about their origins or discovering their life's purpose, this book is a \\"must read\\". I salute Dr. Newton and his open-mindedness in presenting such a controversial and previously unexplored aspect of metaphysical research.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|Torchwood is a team centered on its leader, a mysterious man with an unusually long history given his apparent age, and the team he has assembled to manage aliens and deal with apparently supernatural events, some but not all related to a rift in the time-space continuum, which just happens to be located in Cardiff, Wales.  Some sci fi, some fantasy themes, and some truly original ideas.<br /><br />There is a LOT of variety in the episodes.  Part of this is that they use a variety of writers who have different ideas, but I wonder if perhaps they were instructed to NOT try to make this look like it was all the same writer.  The characters are developed across all episodes and they still make sense with these differing plot lines, but the subject, mood, and purpose of the episodes vary wildly.<br /><br />Sex plays a role in some of the stories.  It is never very graphic or revealing, but it certainly is not restricted to heterosexuality.  Indeed, the team leader is openly gay, and there is a very romantic story about him and a lover that never quite was, in his distant past.  If it would disturb you to see a romantic or lusty kiss shared between two people of various gender combinations and orientations, this show isn't for you.  I thought it was very nicely done.<br /><br />On finishing the first season, we decided to go through the various show recaps, which give background about each episode, including details on how they created the visual effects.  I would not call them \\"special effects\\" in that there is not a lot of computer-rendered animation, rather they show how, for example, a man is hit by a car and goes flying over it.  It is very convincing, and it is interesting and educational to see how they did it by filming various parts and then edited them together carefully.  Although I enjoyed watching the episodes, the recap deepened my appreciation for both the stories and production, based on what the cast and creators had to say about them.<br /><br />I love listening to the characters speaking the local dialect and with the local accent.  There are phrases and expressions that use English words that are outside of my understanding, thus something to learn.  The downside is that at times I miss what they are saying.  This problem is solved by turning on subtitles, something we do for shows where the local accent sometimes overwhelms understanding (The Wire is another example).  But having the words up makes it easier to learn from the way they talk.<br /><br />Overall it is a very good series, and we're enjoying it a lot (now in Season 2).  It makes up for its flaws with truly creative ideas and acting.  It is not destined to find its place among my all-time favorites, but it is very entertaining and well worth watching, though quite variable.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILER<br /><br />Torchwood is an anagram of a famous and long-running BBC serial in which the central figure of Torchwood was first introduced.  I have not seen the episodes from the earlier show, but my sense is that his history is consistent with what is in Torchwood.  So maybe I'll have to start the long process of watching Dr. Who...local dialect and with the local accent.

0545259088|4.0|I read the first two books in the series, Shiver and Linger. And both books were cliffhangers that left me wanting more. No sooner did I finish Linger, did I open Forever. I don't even think I set my Nook down for a breather before I started this book.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book, very much. I read it every free chance I had! However, with that being said, the ending left me wanting so much more...another cliffhanger without another book to feed my want. That was a huge bummer. The book is still worth reading but I wish I had more answers.<br /><br />The same four characters narrated this final installment of the Wolves of Mercy Falls series. There was only one small addition to the main four - the voice of Shelby. We only saw her perspective once and it was a great way to start this book and grab the reader's attention.<br /><br />Cole St. Clair emerged as my favorite character of this entire series. His story and the resolution of his story was fantastic. His research and scientific mind was a surprise but a nice surprise that really added to this crazy story. He was funny and romantic and arrogant and just a wonderful character that I wanted to follow and find out what he did and what happened when he was around.<br /><br />I wish Isabel would have been portrayed a bit nicer and less bitchy. But I get it...that is who she is and how she holds herself out to the world. It suits her and the story. I just wish she were a bit nicer. But she always made me laugh. Her role in the end was great!<br /><br />Officer Koenig is another favorite character of mine. You wouldn't think the cop who kept questioning Sam would be a good guy but I'm so glad he turned out to be one!<br /><br />I most definitely would recommend this book, especially if you have read Shiver and Linger. I couldn't imagine anyone reading the first two books and not wanting to finish this terrific trilogy! While this last book left me wanting more and maybe even a little disappointed because of that, it was still a great series that I would recommend.<br /><br />[...]mend.    [...]

0743297334|5.0|I approached this book not knowing very much about Ernest Hemingway (I only knew that he killed himself and that he wrote in short sentences).  So, I can give a review that has no assumptions.<br /><br />The main character, Jake, is a guy that I could go drinking with.  While he has his own opinions on things, he will listen to what you have to say.  You can have many conversations with the man, on a variety of topics, and Jake can keep up with you and keep the conversation lively.  He doesn't thrust his opinions on you, but \\"tells it like it is\\".  Jake can hang with those flaky expatriates that live in Paris, and be friends with them.  However, Jake has deeper feelings that are not quite written in the book, but you can sense them.<br /><br />For beginners, Jake is hopelessly in love with a seriously \\"high maintenance\\" beauty named Brett - but he won't completely admit it (he actually does, but then withdraws when she shrugs him off), and he tries to fake bravado or coolness or whatever, so that he won't appear weak or desperate to her.  The girl of his dreams is not really someone you'd marry and settle down with, but he's in love with her, and maybe the two of them can continue on their partying ways after they marry - or maybe Jake hopes to settle her down.  To me, the tragedy of the novel is Jake's love for this woman, and it is hopeless for him to believe that he can have a life with her.  Jake's character is poignant in this regard, and I was truly saddened by his character.<br /><br />Ernest Hemingway's writing is economical, to say the least.  He writes like a newspaperman (no coincidence that the main character is a newspaper reporter).  His sentences are very short/staccato.  As you read the book, the pages fly by so quickly that you can devour the book in just a few hours - I owe this to the quickness of the prose and, of course, to the short length of the novel.  I loved Hemingway's writing style - each sentence gets to the point, and only the point.  But while many of these short sentences seem simply to describe things, there is a lot of intention between the lines.  So, while the writing is economical, there is more than meets the eye.<br /><br />Also, I felt like I was riding along with Jake on his trip to Spain (honestly, I felt like a buddy tagging along).  Most likely, I would have done the same things as Jake does (assuming I was still single, maybe a little younger).  That is, we'd go out and see the sights, walk around, and drink.  I have to admit that the characters do more drinking than I would on such a trip (beer with breakfast for instance), but I think I could hang with them for a couple of days.  Although, in the throes of drink, the characters can get quite mean - which seems to fall in with reality.<br /><br />Now that you know my feelings about the book, here's a summary of the novel.<br /><br />Jake is the center of the novel.  He's a newspaper writer who wants to go the the Pamplona bull fights in Spain.  Before he goes, he introduces us to two other major characters in Brett and Robert.  As an unfortunate sign of the times, Robert's \\"Jewness\\" is something that is brought up more forcefully than would be politically correct nowadays.  I am not sure what the purpose of letting us know that Robert is a Jew, unless it's supposed to be some opposite of the Catholicism practiced by Jake (and the hap-hazard way that Brett practices Catholicism).<br /><br />In any case, both Brett and Robert end up in Pamplona with Jake, along with a couple of other people Jake knows - including a guy who has married Brett (although Brett is nowhere near a marriageable person - I think her husband suffers the misery that Jake would if Brett had married him).<br /><br />While in Pamplona, Jake meets these other people he knows and goes fishing.  Jake does a good job of describing the scenes that they pass through, and the bull fights are given in wonderful detail.  I learned a lot about these fights (personally, I find bull fighting reprehensible, but Jake describes things in such a matter-of-fact way that I could deal with them).  Of course, a lot of alcohol is consumed, his girl Brett has eyes for a bull fighter, and Robert becomes a big problem.<br /><br />As an event, the Pamplona Bull Fights and the festivities surrounding them, were very vividly told and the reader is along for the ride.<br /><br />After the bull fights, Jake still has some vacation time left and manages to avoid home for another week.  Brett meets with him, and it is here that we see that Jake and Brett are never to be - but I'm sure they will remain friends forever.<br /><br />I was really heartbroken by the character of Jake, someone who can't have the woman he wants, even though he is certainly willing to make any concession for his potential girl.  I even suspect that Jake would put up with Brett's infidelities, just so long as she came home to him.<br /><br />One last bit of warning to the readers of today involves a certain derogatory term used to describe blacks (the \\"N word\\").  Jake, and others, casually use this word.  I didn't feel like they did so in a hurtful sense, but I did think the word was meant to indicate that the blacks were somehow not on the same level as whites (Robert, the Jew, suffered similarly).  The time frame of this novel was right after WWI, but I have no concept of the feelings of the time, so I can't comment on the hatefulness implied by this term - but I am guessing that its use wasn't pleasant to those to whom it referred, and it wasn't meant as a pleasantly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this book i a neverending if twists and turns. when i read i could never stop if i wanted to. i love the books and i would suggest them to anyone interseted in reading!

B0078N2MTE|2.0|The ending was pathetic. It moves way too slow. Very disappointed. Make a real survival movie. Why did the guy have to be portrayed as nuts? The only thing that made sense was the expense to make plans for a shelter and survive.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I think that that this game ia really really really reallly fun. could have more costumes but other than that its fun

I absolutely love this show!  I ordered the season 1 for him for his birthday as we had just watched season 4 and wanted to know how it all started and I will tell you this!  If you are even thinking about ordering this season 1 do yourself a favor and order all 4 seasons now!  lol  I finished season 1 in 3 days and already ordered seasons 2 and 3 because I have to know what happens next!  Love love love this show!!!

078322737X|2.0|I didn't find this movie to be that great. There were some funny scenes here and there but nothing special. The movie was very slow with meaningless dialogues. I do love the way the movie was directed. This is a movie which starts during night and ends next day. I really loved that idea and found it unique. It wasn't a movie with a time frame longer than 24 hours and that was neat. The characters were likable for the most part . So why Did I rate this movie so low? I thought the movie could have easily been less longer if it wasn't for meaningless scenes that added nothing to the movie as a whole. Too much dialogue and very boring. There was no point to the movie besides showing people what it was like to be a teen during the 50's. This is the first and last time I watch this movie. A one time movie for me nothing more.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is the perfect light-weight cover for the Kindle fire.  It is well made and worth the price-- not \\"cheaply made\\" as other reviewers seem to indicate.  I liked it so much I bought a second one for my brother!

These guys saw 700+ birds. How/where/why they did it, and how the experience and competition affected their lives and the people around them makes a sometimes humorous, sometimes quite moving, always entertaining and beautiful movie.
1849514003|5.0|This book is exactly what it says it is- a cookbook.  It gives you sample codes and a bit of a summary on how to use them, and that's about it.  So if you're looking for a book to LEARN (ie you're a beginner), this is not the book for you.  However, if you have a little bit of experience, this book is exactly what you need.  Tons and tons of useful code here so you won't have to reinvent the wheel.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good game. Impressed with the number of levels. A Subtle change to the classic Mahjong rules add a nice twist
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on everything my phone, my laptop, my work computer and laptop, and my Kindle Fire. It is a Blessing to be able to carry your word, search the word, and live the word and this app helps make it all possible!
0307913090|5.0|I LOVE the HBO \\"Game of Thrones\\" television show and I have a long boring drive to work, so I decided to purchase the audio book to keep me entertained.

B006BDHAX0|2.0|Fun game, but not appropriate for the Kindle Fire as the program constantly crashes.  It is almost impossible to get through more than one or two games without a crash.  Very frustrating.  This may work better on other devices, but my experience has not been good.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|The Help, by Kathryn Stockett is a fantastic book to read. The plot and characters kept me wanting to never put the book down. The book takes place in a time where blacks were thought of as not equals. There is a specific white girl who secretely talks to the black maids about what it is like to work for a white family in order for her to write her book. The girl's name is Skeeter, she is a young girl who is not like most of the other girls. She went to college and she gains very close relationships with two older black maids. As she writes her book, there becomes a variety of main characters sharing their stories which gave me more than just a single character to follow. This makes it more enjoyable as I was able to see different points of view of relationships between whites and their black maids.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|it was fun the first hour, untill I got lost ...The navigation was horrible, some of the clues were difficult, just a frustrating game at the end... just not worth the 1.99 price tag.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I'm glad I watched the movie way before I even thought about picking up the book. It was entertaining and I loved the characters. It was really everything I wanted in a movie like this. I would've given it 5 stars hands down. That's before I read the books.  Now, well yeah this movie is so bad if you read the books first. ALL THE MAJOR POINTS have been tossed aside. & I'm talking about this is the bases of the story line of the actual books and they completely ignored it for the movie. Believe me there's no way they can make a movie for the 2nd book because they cut out everything for the sequel to even make sense unless of course they destroy that movie too and just make up stuff as they go like with The Lighting Thief.  The movie by it self is a pretty good film. The movie with the book is the most horrible adaptation from book to film probably ever.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is the best game their is, even better than angry birds...  people don't no what their talking about cause ive had this game for a while and it has never went to open feint not once!I am totally addicted to this game!
B005KELW26|3.0|For what I got, I do believe that the price tag was too high.  Yes, the color is nice; yes, the corner straps hold it snugly; yes, the magnetic closure works; yes, the small cardboard packaging was secure.  That said, the front cover is warped (hard to describe--concave, I guess)--the top and bottom edges curve up like an old cover on a hard-backed book.  In fact, if you look at the fourth screenshot, doesn't it seem a bit \\"curved\\"?  Was I expecting leather-like quality?  Yes.  Feels more like 1950s Naugahyde (remember \\"Naugahyde\\"?).  This is the first review I've done on what I consider a \\"So-so\\" Amazon product.  I'm usually a 4- or 5-star person, but not this time.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game. Well worth the price. Anybody can play; whether you're a baby boomer like me or a youngster like my 4, 5 and 11 year old grandchildren. Did I mention I love my Kindle Fire!

B0068FYZCA|5.0|American Graffiti is not only an American Classic, it may be George Lucas best film. The movie centers around a group of just graduated from high school teens and their last nite of Childhood. A very young Ricky Dreyfus and Ron Howard are the two real focal points who are bound for the East coast and college the next day. Between the unbelievable Rock and Roll soundtrack and the Bravo performances this is a movie that will be just as good in 50 years as it was when it came out in 1972. Also the picture looks very sharp on this new Blu Ray disc. Two thumbs Way Up!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a kids movie even I can watch.  My kids (4 and 6 years) get scared easily but there is nothing scary in this movie.  Even the \\"villian\\" is silly.  Highly recommended!

0765316897|5.0|I've quickly become a huge Brandon Sanderson fan. The Hero of Ages wraps up the storyline, ties up all the plot points, and concludes one of the best fantasy epics that I've ever read. If you even have a passing interest in the fantasy genre, you owe it to yourself to read this wonderful story. Great job by Mr. Sanderson. I look forward to reading more of his work.
B001KEGRC0|5.0|I took my son (then age 5) to see this in IMAX, and we purchased the DVD afterward. The film itself blends river rafting/adventure, personal narrative, and documentary about the history and ecology of the Grand Canyon.  The pacing and soundtrack were perfect for the story and message, which takes the side of those who feel that our choices and use of water resources have caused damage and a continuing threat to the Canyon.  Those who strongly oppose that message might not enjoy the film.  My son and I, however, loved it, and my son was moved to try to find out more about water conservation.  He has asked to see it again on DVD and watched it through from beginning to end, which is saying a lot for a 6-year-old attention span.  I plan to give it as a gift and am glad to own it.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey.  I just received the original UK edition of Season 2 and find that does not include the finale which was just on tv in the states and which one can watch also online.  The first season set does include all the episodes of that season so I am puzzled and dismayed by this critical omission.  If the Season 2 finale wasn't ready to be included, that information should have been provided.  A major disappointment and puzzlement.

0307591549|5.0|Growing up in a middle-class family, post-WWII, the prevailing notion I inherited was that once you become successful, then you can be happy. \\"Successful\\" was defined as having more money than God...or at least as much as someone we knew who was apparently happy like the town bank president or the owner of the Chevrolet dealership. These people were by all measures happy because they were successful. So my hopeful goal was to figure out a way to be successful and then, by some miracle, I'd become happy.<br /><br />Not so, says human potential expert Shawn Achors. In fact, not only is it untrue, the reverse is accurate:<br /><br />Be Happy. Be Successful.<br /><br />And Achors has the research to back it up.<br /><br />Reading this book is a bit like sorting through a compilation of positive psychology research, written in somewhat of a story-telling format, while experiencing the author's delightful sense of humor. I rarely laugh out loud reading b-books. I did with this one...on a flight to a speaking engagement...waking up the person seated next to me.<br /><br />Achors offers up his seven principles in such an accessible style that to read them is to begin practicing them. They are duplicable, not just by the bank president or Chevy dealer, but by the rest of us, too. In fact, we may be in a better position to practice them into habits because we are more open to making the switch from success/happiness to happiness/success. We entrepreneurs resist the corporate trappings that encumber change--the frozen chosen--and welcome an opportunity to focus our sights on a new bullseye--Be Happy to Be Successful.<br /><br />Buy the book, hit the target, and discover which one of these seven principles prompts you to higher achievement the quickest as you read it. The one that insightfully jump-started me was the one about investing more deeply in social connections. Most of us entrepreneurs (solopreneurs) when confronted with a negative world or down economy, go inside to figure it out and work harder. (At least the men do...see Ivan Misner's new book, Networking and Sex: It's Not What You Think.) Achors says happy, successful business professionals go outside to figure it out, investing in their relationships more deeply, and discover a \\"friendsource\\" positive response. I got on the phone the next morning and guess what? Achors is right--it works.<br /><br />So do his other six principles.<br /><br />One other experience I had with this book: every time I read a chapter, my own positivity improved. My own happiness increased which activitated the ripple effect of spreading the happiness to my partners at work and home. What a novel idea--a book that delivers more than information, but an experience germinated in the soil of that information.<br /><br />Get your copy today so you will Be Happy/Be Successful.<br /><br />You'll be glad, er happy, you did.an Misner's new book, Networking and Sex: It's Not What You Think.)

0439023513|2.0|Just finished the third and final book of the Hunger Games trilogy.  In this final installment, Katniss is with the rebels and they are in a war to defeat the Capitol.  The stakes are high as she fights along with the other rebels in a winner-take-all war.  There's not much I can say beyond that without giving out some serious spoilers.  So here they come.  Skip if you don't want to know anything.  <Spoilers>  I have a lot of criticism for this book.  First off, people drop like flies.  Previous victors are killed off in rapid-fire succession like red-shirts on a Star Trek episode and very little is given to these losses other than passing sentiment.  Peeta is brutally brainwashed by Snow into wanting to kill Katniss.  This powerful story element was mostly flubbed by Collins and it quickly reverts to the tired love triangle theme that just continues to go nowhere for 90% of even this book.  Finally, the killing of her sister Prim has to be one of the most pointless, even sadistic, story elements from a writer I've run across in years.  The very fact Prim was where she was *ahead* of the front lines, and that the whole point of the death was to take Gale out of the love-triangle equation by means of some of the most feeble logic I've ever heard made me throw my hands up in frustration at Collins.  As a core theme, the love triangle, is mostly flubbed.  I'd hoped something good would come of it and see our characters bloom into something rich and heartwarming.  Mostly I just wanted to smack the three of them.  Despite each of their flaws, Peeta needed to grow a pair most of the time and Gale should have confessed his love for her in some heartfelt and real expression of his inner self.  Katniss could have actually *choosen* one of them.  But instead of this, Collins merely makes Gale out to be a monster (on trumped up charges none-the-less) and Katniss ends up with Peeta kind of by default even though he finally sees clearly that Katniss never really loved him.  Eventhis `resolution' you don't find out until the tacked-on epilogue.  And the reason she's with Peeta?  Because she owes him more as he did more for her earlier.  Really?  That's why you marry someone? And that's what you do with a story element going on for 3 books?  For those that at least enjoyed Haymitch's presence: this staple, interesting and ever-working in the background character in the first books is barely even present in this one.  Felt he was completely under-utilized.  Turning the Capitol into deathtraps, and having custom-bred dogs that whisper Katniss name felt like overdone and feeble attempts to recapture the interesting Hunger Games theme - but mostly didn't work and it was too little, too late.  The storytelling itself was disjointed and spotty.  Big gaps of time with hard landings left some of the story hard to follow and further exaserbated the feelings of disconnectedness with the characters.  Finally, Katniss.  She suffers badly from PTSD effects through most of the book, several times getting drugged into oblivion so she can just hang on.  She does take on the role of the Mockingjay - but that role never really goes anywhere and Collins absolutely blows a great opportunity to make that a much more powerful symbol.  Instead, all it turns into is a propaganda piece that Katniss herself isn't very interested in.  But the big failing in my opinion is that Katniss doesn't seem to grow as a person.  There are a few attempts to protest morally questionable activities like the bombing of the nut in district 2, but that doesn't go anywhere. In fact, she shows quite the opposite of character and growth when she votes to throw the children of the Capitol's leaders into one last Hunger Games (run by the rebels of all things) with no real discussion of the morality given.  It gets like 3 pages - bang - she votes to throw these innocent kids into the arena and nothing more is said and about 10 pages later assassinates Coin.  Overall, we're left with a burned-out, war-scarred character that hasn't shown any particular character growth or hope.  I was left caring very little for her when I could have been there with her all along if she'd shown even one tenth the character or growth you'd see with Frodo or other person in a titanic struggle like this.  Or at least started to find some sort of healing at the end.  I don't know if I would qualify this book as a teen book.  It's got some pretty rough story lines and themes: PTSD, mental and physical abuse, drugged states to get through personal crises, many morally questionable activites (that don't get questioned) and plenty of death and destruction. While these topics can be appropriate if consequences and characters struggle to make right choices, but you get little of that. I didn't find the way they were handled to be very productive or geared towards helping teen readers understand these topics.  There are some good points.  There is an interesting and clever bit about the power struggle between President Coin, President Snow and Katniss, but it felt like too little too late.  </Spoilers>  So, I had a lot more criticism of this book than good things to say and would even hesitate to call it teen-appropriate.  While it was a decent attempt to bring the elements to a close - the writing and story just fell apart in too many ways.  I was hoping for a lot out of this book - but it left me disappointed.  If you saw the story cracks in book 2, then those cracks are absolute canyons in this book.  You should probably read it to finish the trilogy since it's only 10 audio discs (600 minutes); but don't go into it expecting a very good story.  You just aren't left feeling very connected or concerned about Katniss or most of the other characters (that manage to still be alive) by the end.  I was just glad this train-ride was over.  Sadly, the journey started so well in book 1 has turned into a destination to which I never want to go back.  Even as I sit here writing this I amthinking of ways in which this book could have been better.  Sigh.  I give this book a C- rating.  It finished everything up; but left me with numerous problems with the morality of their choices, the plot, and the largely unsatisfying ending to the characters.

B000AMWIVM|4.0|I am a fan of Saw. Some say \\"gore-porn\\", some say original indi thriller. This 2 disc DVD edition is a great own for a collector of film and saw fans alike. I gave this 4 out of 5 due ONLY to the fact that the case itself is easily breakable. Like Saw? Do you buy every movie you see? This is a great addition to your collection... just don't drop it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Awesome game! Worth every penny, awesome game for all ages. Wish there were more items and nuts, but oh well.
B00005ATZT|5.0|The Fugitive is a classic action thrill ride through one man's grief over losing his wife and then being accused of her murder. Harrison Ford is very believable in his role as he searches for the one armed man and Tommy Lee Jones is flawless as usual as his character attempts to out think and recapture the fugitive. Great story, awesome cast. Worth every penny.
B002NWRMVS|1.0|Would love to give this a 5 Star review, as I so enjoy Norah Jones' music. Sadly, the CD was broken when it arrived. Rather than a plastic CD case, it comes in a cardboard case and was mailed in an envelope with next to no insulation. Of course I was able to return it for credit, thanks to Amazon's great return policy, but I think I will just buy it locally rather than risk another broken CD.
630512762X|5.0|Action packed and full of moments that will shock you and possibly gross you out. Nicholas Cage was eerily effective as both the insane, evil criminal and the disheartened family man. John Travolta was truly creepy in the role of the bad guy. I could barely watch him as he tricked the good cop's family into welcoming him in and basically made the world turn upside down. Was the plot a little predictable? Sure. Was it a great movie anyway? Definately! Add this one to your action collection even if you aren't a fan of Travolta or Cage. You won't regret it.
B0071QIN00|1.0|This a crappy ripoff of Trials HD. All the levels a are poorly designed and at times even broken.  A game should be challenging due to clever design, not broken levels.
6304806434|5.0|I loved this movie! The story is engaging with Cage's character dragging you by the heartstrings to root for him making it home to his little girl. You immediately sink into dread when he is placed on the plane with criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus and the Sicko rapist. Thank goodness Nick Cage is there to save the day. This movie delivers on action in a big way with sadness and pain thrown in for good measure. A sprinkling of comedy rounds the movie out to make it the real deal. I bought it on VHS and bought it again on DVD. A keeper no matter what machine you play it on!
B003K1EYM6|1.0|I bought the Apple Camera kit so that I could download my Compact Flash CF cards from both my Canon 5D MKII and 7D to the iPad 2 in the field and reuse memory cards.  I was using an non powered common CF/SD card reader to download both JPEG and RAW files to my iPad 2.  I thought this was wonderful.  Then came along an OS update to the iPad 2 and voila, I started to receive and error that the device required too much power.  The SD card reader, which had previously worked reading a full SD card, now would only began to read a few picture file and then would either hang and only read a few images or again, the low power error.  After some reading on the Apple support pages from other users, it appears that the OS change limited or decreased the amount of power out the charge port on the iPad 2.  The reasoning for this change was to extend battery life of the iPad 2.  I tried using the camera USB kit adapter to a CF reader that was powered (Epson P-3000 Digital Media Player), connected to the AC supply, and it would read in the picture files.  But, using it as a device in the field without AC power, the Apple Camera Kit is useless.  If you have access to power, they work fine.  I gave a rating of 1 because I bought and was using them in the field and on location without the need for access to AC power.  That made the iPad 2 a great Photography product.  It still is, but requires AC Power.  I now must dump off my CF cards to my Epson Digital Media Player and then when I get home can dump to my iPad 2, but then I also have my iMac and all it's tools to manage those photographs with.  If Apple could find a way to manage the power back to the port or let you select when that port power has higher output, if would make the Apple Camera Kit a more useful tool.

0345533054|1.0|Spoilers ahead.  Another Coben book.  Another wuss (Will) with no personality as the main character.  More plot holes covered up by revealing other plot holes.  Another absurd plot.  This time he crosses the line and, as the narrator, actually lies to the audience showing them that Ghost killed Julie.  This is not the \\"Unreliable Narrator\\" device, this is just disregard for his audience.  The FBI put more effort into finding, protecting, tracking and luring a witness (Ken) to testify against a big crime boss, than to getting the crime boss himself, who in the end was rather easily caught.  In the end the hero is more of a bystander.  The young girl Katy actually does more to apprehend the drug dealer murderer Ken.  Also, we are supposed to believe a few ridiculous things:  -Ken kills a sorority girl because she found out about drugs at college.  (Ken must've been planning a whole lot of other murders because who doesn't know that there are drugs at college?)  -Julie had given birth to Will's daughter Carly.  (Without anyone knowing, except his older brother, Ken...)  -Ken takes Carly (for some reason, and does something with this newborn, which was never explained.  And Julie doesn't seem too bothered by it).  -Ken tries to get Julie to help him frame Ghost for the sorority girl's murder.  (A brilliant choice of an accomplice; \\"I will ask the mother of the child I stole to help me frame her close friend (Ghost) for killing her sorority friend.  I am a drug dealer with access to criminal minds, but no, I will ask a college girl to help me stage a murder scene.\\")  -Julie says no; warns Ghost about the plot.  Ghost does nothing about this.  Ken somehow finds out that she told Ghost, so Ken meets Julie in her basement and kills her.  -Ghost arrives but too late to save Julie, but just in time to shoot Ken (just a little bit).  -Now is when Ghost decides on his mission in life: to stop Ken from reuniting with his brother Will's daughter.  (What?  Why does he care?)  -Inthe prologue, Ghost admits to also killing Nora's (Will's fiance/wife) ex-husband, to further provide for Will's secure future.  (Ghost goes to extreme lengths with no realistic motivation).  I think the lesson for future bestselling novelists is this: keep your audience dizzy so they won't notice the stupidity swirling around them and then hold them still long enough to show them a happy ending.  Oh and make your cover yellow.  And write your name really big on it.
0385344228|3.0|The concept of a courtroom drama attached to a mystery of how a young teen died is intriguing. Did Jacob do it? If he didn't, is the circumstantial evidence gathered by the DA enough to convict him? Was that evidence gathered as a campaign by an overreaching DA or was it solid police work?<br /><br />This is what interested me enough to buy the book but the execution left a good deal to be desired. Perhaps it's a culture clash between me and the upper class eastern liberal sorts who are the parents of Jacob and who play the major role in the book. For example, at one point after being arraigned, Jacob and his parents meet for the first time with their defense attorney. Jacob shows up full of petulant attitude lazily slouching in his 'hoodie'.<br /><br />His parents do nothing but continue to tell him that he's loved by them and that they believe in him. Were it me, and Jacob were my son, I'd explain to him that this is serious business and he is facing a life sentence so this is no time to play the whining teen but instead, dump the attitude, burn the hoodie, don a suit and treat your lawyer with the respect he deserves. Enough of the Dr. Spock coddling.<br /><br />In addition to this irritation (which probably won't irritate some readers) the book is full of incredible improbable events. For some reason, never explained, the parents hire a shrink to determine if their kid is the mentally capable of doing this crime. Why? What was to gain from this except to forward a particular element of the book which is the theory that criminal behavior may be genetic? In the real world, parents would frantically avoid such a shrink or such a determination.<br /><br />A  major element of the book is resolved through a deus de machina of sorts - the action of one of these magic people who can 'fix all things'. At first, this resolution seems satisfactory but upon examination and reflection, it's clearly impossible to have occurred in such a fashion as to be the resolution. In fact, if anything, it should have created the opposite effect from a resolution. I can't discuss it in detail without a spoiler.<br /><br />The book just sputters to a sad and somewhat inconclusive finish which left me unsure. If you enjoyed the finish to the Sopranos TV show, you'll find equal enjoyment in this book's wrap up. In the end, I found myself more bored by the slow parts and annoyed at other parts than entertained by this one. Still, it's well written and I got to learn what a Spyderco Civilian knife is. That's one scary looking knife.he opposite effect from a resolution. I can't discuss it in detail without a spoiler.

B0019GJ4EC|3.0|I don't usually seek out horror movies and just sort of stumbled on this one by accident; with that in mind I found this one reasonably interesting and gave it three stars. It has some well known actors who bring their expertise to their rolls; Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh and her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis share credits with Adrienne Barbeau and John Houseman to tell the story of the seaside village of Antonio Bay and the curse that hangs over it.<br /><br />The movie starts with an effective scene of a campfire with an old fisherman telling some children a ghost story. From that point on the story is well crafted and managed to hold my attention fairly well; as with most movies of this genre one has to be willing to accept certain assumptions and if that is possible for the viewer they are in for a reasonably exciting ride down horror movie lane.<br /><br />I had heard of the movie for many years and had seen the commercials advertising it and found it lived up to the hype fairly well. If you are a fan of horror movies you have probably alread seen this one, if not it's worth a look.

B006UG90RM|5.0|My thoughts and opinions on the new album:<br /><br />1 Tattoo - I just don't get it as a lead off track/single, lyrics are not as good as the music. Song is mixed way better on the album than the questionable YouTube video they put out. Not everyone is good off the tee box at #1, I'll give them a mulligan after the last 14 tumultuous years off.<br />2 She's The Woman - 1970's demo track redone, classic VH sounds, cool chugging rhythm section, decent solo.<br />3 You And Your Blues - I'm not a fan of songs singing about other songs, I get the song, the chorus is catchy, but it's just OK. Missing Mike Anthony backing vocals (tear in eye). Classic VH outro is a nice finish.<br />4 China Town - Wow. Welcome back Mr. Edward Van Halen, the reports of your demise have been greatly exaggerated. Punch in the face right off the bat. Love the song, love it. Could sit comfortably next to songs like Mean Street or Get Up and not blink. Crushing most of current rock songs.<br />5 Blood And Fire - Look at all the people here tonight! Another 1980's VH sounding track. Funny DLR talking middle section, tip of cap to long time fans. Really great solo, for realz.<br />6 Bullethead - 1970's demo track redone. Fast, grinding, fun. I'm fine with the redux of these 70's demos, they kick ace in 2012 too.<br />7 As Is - Al had to have a drum intro song, come on it's a VH album! Ed rips the stuffing out of this song. Wow, he has some electric licks on this. Wolfgang keeps the low end fine on this speed racer. Solo gave me goose bumps, just really classic VH kung fu.<br />8 Honeybabysweetiedoll - Cool modern intro leads into great rhythm riffs. VH sounds really fresh and 2012 relevant here. One of the best on the album!<br />9 The Trouble With Never - Sixth straight great track in a row. Band is in the flow now, Ed is giving lessons to rock guitarists. Wolfgang has been practicing, a lot. Maybe I don't hate DLR for what he did to the band anymore...just don't ride an inflatable mic on stage again.<br />10 Outta Space - 1970's demo track redone. I should be riding in a 1974 Camaro, openly drinking Schlitz pull top cans for this one. I'm still a bit shocked at this point how much I like the album.<br />11 Stay Frosty - Really going to be a fun live song. Song is the grandson of Ice Cream Man, just a fun rocker, great Eddie solo.<br />12 Big River - 1970's demo track redone. Cool intro, sounds like it's from Diver Down era, classic DLR-VH stuff. Great groove, fun to sing along and drive to. Another perfect solo fitting the song.<br />13 Beats Workin' - 1970's demo track redone, sounds like like 1970's VH, in a good way. Should be sitting in a van with a circle back window, interior carpet and a keg. Add cowbell, 'nuff said.<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br />China Town<br />As Is<br />Honeybabysweetiedoll<br />Trouble With Never<br />Outta Space<br />Stay Frosty<br /><br />Final thought:<br />I am really surprised at how great this album sounds. All VH drama aside, they have done a phenomenal job here. Ed is alive and well on this recording. I thought he lost his famous brown tone after VH III, but he found his sound. The band is tight, and DLRs chops are fun and surprisingly sing-along-able, I forgot the DLR BS while listening, and just enjoyed the ride. I cannot wait to see some of these live in Pittsburgh. I went into my little review with low expectations, expecting to be very critical. I came out loving the album. Tracks, 4, 6-13 are VH at the top of their game. No real duds on the album, Tattoo should not have been the first single, nor had the awful hand camera video, it's not to shabby here. Definitely worth the purchase, the deluxe version has a 4 song acoustic set, it was worth the couple extra bucks for the fan.again.<br />10 Outta Space - 1970's demo track redone.

I went into my little review with low expectations, expecting to be very critical. I came out loving the album. Tracks, 4, 6-13 are VH at the top of their game. No real duds on the album, Tattoo should not have been the first single, nor had the awful hand camera video, it's not to shabby here. Definitely worth the purchase, the deluxe version has a 4 song acoustic set, it was worth the couple extra bucks for the fan.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|this was good but not it was fun but it just stopped in the middle because I didn't buy the full version stupid
B006ON41FC|4.0|cute and fun game. very entertaining, but with a few lag issues.. nothing major but it does take a toll on the overall gameplay. hence 4 stars
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Like the challenge of gaining more artifacts!  I actually like any match games...it mixes it with a comic book feel because it gives a story line.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is capital AMAZING! it sounds stupid at first but its fun. it is definatly difficult. but its still super fun!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have not played in a long time, it was quick and easy to pull up and play, lots of options to personalize it the way you like.
B00526ZKYS|2.0|I was looking forward to reading a long, dystopian novel. However, it was incredibly wordy with little dialogue. The writing was beautiful but did nothing to encourage me to care about the characters. As a true lover of dystopian novels (like the hunger games) I advise you to avoid disappointment and give this one a miss.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this everyday! The level of difficultly is spot on. Don't play unless you want to become an addict.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This MicroShell Folio Cover is exactly what I wanted! It's lightweight,it protects my Kindle Fire well and it fits into my purse perfectly. Two other people ordered one after they saw mine.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this was a fun vane and I stayed up mate playin it one night then I didwnt sleep for 6 days and I gotsuper hyper and this is all a lie!!!!!
145162445X|5.0|Truly Outstanding and Comprehesive Indepth Mastering of this Ultimate Topic  February 21, 2012  This book shows the true genius of Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss and his extraordinarily insightful mastering of the ultimate questions, \\"Where did the universe and we come from?\\" as well as \\"Why there is SOMETHING rather than NOTHING?\\"..This book is truly a \\"game changer\\" and as Dr. Richard Dawkins indicated \\"possibly the most significant book since Charles Darwin's Origin of the Species in 1859\\"..I too simply have to agree with Dawkins..this book is a must read for any intellectual and a masterpiece of genius by one of the top world Astrophysicists and Cosmologists. I would not recommend it for any fundamentalist religious people..it would ONLY give them nightmares and a wonderful migraine..  Reviewer: Dr. P
B006O5YHUY|5.0|In almost the same way I feel about \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", or maybe \\"Star Trek (2009)\\", hardly anything here is new, if anything at all. Yet, I can watch these movies again and again because what they did, they did it well.
1611136954|3.0|I like the Lincoln Lawyer series so this was purchased to add to my collection.  I liked it but it was not as good as Lincoln Lawyer or Brass Verdict.  I will continue with the series because I know that they all can't be 5 Star and I do not want to leave any negative reviews. I would recommend it to friends.
0545305497|5.0|I had heard a lot of great reviews of this book series, so I decided to go ahead and buy it without reading it first, which I don't often do.  I was not disappointed - all three books are easy to read but still with great, attention-grabbing plotlines.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Loved Grizzly Manor, and this game has the same type of play.  It's a much longer game, which is appreciated, and the puzzles are *slightly * more difficult.  Fire Maple did a great job with this.  I finished it, and then helped my daughter (8 yrs old) through it.  She loved Grizzly Manor, and was so excited that we had another adventure on which to embark.  Totally worth the $2!  I can't wait for the next game from this developer.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Awesome! For a free game its entertaining. Different tiles in each level and get difficult to tell them apart which makes it more challenging. Collecting different artifacts and trophies for faster times gives you a kick in the butt to go faster. I definetly recommend this game!
B0061S073A|5.0|perfect!! I love how easy it is to use. my kids like that they can use it whenever they want without me peering over their shoulders.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app, it allows me to work on my writing no matter where I am or what device I'm working on!

B0071MV540|1.0|So disappointed in Eddie Murphy's return. Nonsense plot, bad acting. They tried to get us to care about the characters, but about the time I walked out I was cheering for the police. bad, bad, bad movie. It'll be on Netflix or Amazon for free soon enough, save your money.
B006ON41FC|4.0|like I said it need a update. maybe. like. make. more. suits. or something.  that is all I have to say

0316017930|5.0|Outliers is a book that opens your eyes to ideas that you have never even considered. In this 300 page quick enjoyable read Malcolm Gladwell takes his audience on a journey to discover what makes someone stand out, above average and a high achiever or in the words of Gladwell, an outlier. This is one book that you will not regret taking the time to read. It is a fast paced book that opens your mind to new ideas every chapter. All the different stories are tied together to show how different outliers in history are made. Gladwell's performance is remarkable in the way he brings his research to life. Gladwell gets the audience to think of many different situations and how an outlier is not just magically made but rather becomes one through different opportunities given to him or her throughout their life. Although this novel is classified as self-help book it is so much more, it captures the readers attention from the very first chapter and is a book you will not want to put down. This review alone is not enough to show how well written and eye opening this book really is. Reading this book will give you an entirely different outlook on not only the world around you but also our worlds history and how today has come to be. This book is a #1 national bestseller for a reason and you will not regret making the decision to read it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really liked the introduction to the game. It shows you how to play and use the features. Graphics are clear and beautiful. All G5 games are my favorites.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I'm not sure why people don't like this game. its cute and fun, I mean sure I wanna throw my kindle accross the room sometimes because its so hard but hey, if not it wudnt be interesting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love having YouVersion with me all the time. No excuse not to immerse myself in the Word. Easy to use and the plans are fabulous. Love the reminders! 5 stars!
1439110123|4.0|Great book for college students on a budget. Came in good condition for being used since I'm only going to use it for one semester. It was shipped in a plastic bag so the few front pages came in folded but it arrived fast.

B006M4F67A|5.0|247 Mahjong solitaire, just like the one i play on my phone, can't get enough of this game, so i downloaded the other nine versions of mahjong from Battleline Studios. The games don't have as many levels as 247 Mahjong,  but the nine games gets you 54 more levels to play. I think you will enjoy playing this game.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Fun game....will keep you entertained for hours as you exercise your fingers too. Your kids will love to play this game too but don't worry it doesn't require parental control,family friendly game.
B000LXV9ME|5.0|Where knowledge and education seem to offer the promise of success as their reward, it is only the person of action who can redeem that prize.  The very process of Kaizen, small improvements over time, carries a mystery that Dr. Maurer explains through presentation and example illustrations.  Dr. Maurer takes the theory of Kaizen, and turns it into a process  of creating ongoing results-wherever you find yourself, and whatever you are looking to accomplish.  I had been exposed to Tony Robbins C.A.N.I. model,  (Constant and Neverending Improvement) and find merit in having studied both.  I like the examples that make One Small Step a series of case histories of how others have taken the Kaizen Way to Success. I prefer the audio form of most training expecially when it is offered by the author, and this is no exception. Aloha
B004UHSB5A|5.0|its fun, its easy, it has instructuons, its very simple. So if you like dominoes like me DOWNLOAD IT NAO! xD
B004UHSB5A|4.0|Tiles small on Kindle Fire.  Tiles  have to be placed just so on some placements or they won't stick.  After a few frustrating games I figured it out.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is awesome. i reccomend this to any one who likes a good challenge and people who love squirrels!
B00078XGRO|4.0|Star Trek First Contact(1996) is one of the best Star Trek movies. I remember saving over $100 in cash so we could pay for our movie tickets and a pile of junk food. We searched six video stores in 1997 to buy a VHS copy. The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise E must stop the Borg from conquering the Earth in the 21st Century. Captain Picard(Patrick Stewart) uses his Borg implants from the TNG episode The Best of Both Worlds to outwit the Borg. The Borg Queen(Alice Krige) tries to seduce Data by giving him human flesh. The away team led by Commander Riker(Jonathan Frakes) must make sure that Dr. Zephram Cochrane completes his warp flight or Starfleet will never exist. The tone of the film is dark and hopeless at times. Dr. Cochrane is a depressed alcoholic who lives in post-World War III Americana. The Borg make up is much more complex in this film and they can inject Borg nanoprobes into your bloodstream! Jerry Goldsmith and his son Joel composed the music score for the film. Cochrane's friend Lily(Alfre Woodard) befriends Picard as they are being chased by the Borg. There's a scene where Picard and Lily hide in a detective noir Holodeck program from two Borg drones. Dr. Cochrane is a rock and roll fan and we get to hear songs by Steppenwolf and Roy Orbison. Dr. Cochrane was featured on the original Star Trek, but the writers of this film created their own version of the character. Jonathan Frakes did a decent job directing the film and he also played Riker in the film. There's a suspenseful scene where Picard, Worf, and Lt. Hawk have to stop Borg drones from setting up a \\"satellite dish\\" on the hull of the Enterprise. The visual effects by ILM are first rate. Alice Krige played the hauntingly beautiful Borg Queen. She played a similar Borg Queen on Star Trek Voyager(1995-2001). I guess she's an homage to the sci-fi/horror film Lifeforce(1985). Star Trek First Contact got a PG-13 rating. It has some violence and Lily curses a few times! There's a cool scene where Picardloses his temper when Lily tells Picard to destroy the Enterprise. It was spoofed on South Park, I think.  Stock footage from Star Trek First Contact was used in a \\"mirror timeline\\" episode of Star Trek Enterprise(2001-2004).  In 1996, the Star Trek franchise was past its prime, but still strong.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|its fun and i got it for free $5 seems a little too high IMHO.  I like collecting the artifacts
B000VNMMPM|5.0|When I first watched this movie, I wasn't sure. First off, I'm not a foreign film gal, and secondly I most certainly am not one to read subtitles! They drive me NUTS! If I had to pay fully for this movie first I wouldn't have watched it. I must say that I accidentally picked this film and said, what the heck, why not! This movie was PHENOMENAL! I loved every second if it, and once watched I told myself I HAD to own it so off I went for the hunt in used bookstores, garage sales, and ran across it at a Flea Market 3000 miles way from where I live! I'm not going to ruin it for you so all I'm going to part with is,  YOU MUST WATCH THIS TERRIFIC FILM!
0439023491|5.0|In Collins' follow up the The Hunger Games we began where we left off with the return of the victors of the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta. A lot has changed back home for Katniss, including her relationship with Gale. A lot has also changed in other Districts too. Unbeknownst to Katniss, she has become the figurehead of a rebellion that is starting up against the Capitol. President Snow knows he must devise a plan to rid himself of Katniss and thanks to the fact that there is a Quarter Quell this year, the President has his chance. This year one female and one male victor of a past Hunger Games from each district must participate.<br /><br />This devastates the families and the reader! The second installment has you more emotional involved with all the characters that you feel awful when you read that Katniss must endure another game. The love triangle is still very much alive with Peeta , Gale and Katniss. Who will she choose or does she even have a choice? Definitely a strong second book and I look forward to reading the conclusion!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games a lot fun,.................can put down. a must have that is great for all ages. will reccomend to others. have fun!
1466401885|5.0|I LOVED this book. I have the ebook and loved it so much that I had to have a hard copy! Travis and Abby are great characters. I would have liked more of an epilogue, but there is going to be a book about Travis' brother so I am hoping that she will throw them in the story somehow!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I'm addicted to this game! The more you play the better you get at it. Cant wait for the next one.
0553584537|3.0|Alone is entertaining story but a predictable mystery. I enjoyed reading a story set in Boson. Bobby Dodge is a sympathetic main character, as is the secondary character Catherine Rose Gagnon. I didn't really buy the extent of the power one of the villain exercised. I listened to the Audible version. The narrator Anna Fields does not get the Boston accents right but otherwise does an OK job. I probably will check another title by Gardner.
B001AQMBNC|5.0|Love this movie. The special effects were very good for back then! The actors were wonderful and really work well together, you could feel the love getting stronger and the plot was strong, will really keep you on the edge. One of my top 5 oldies!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app that reads the Bible to you!! I use it all the time to easily reference things as well.
B000002KKX|5.0|I have been listening to this album since the early 80;s and never get bored with it, This is one of those albums that has not lost it's appeal for me. \\"Sailing\\" is a song that can relax your nerves like no other, it has that lush feel to it with the strings in the background.<br /><br />On this debut album Christopher Cross had the privilege to get some great artist doing back up for him including but not limited to Don Henley, Michael McDonald, Valerie Carter. Larry Carlton did great with his guitar. The album was a big success when released and famously beat Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" as the best album of the year, with sailing as best song of the year and best record of the year.<br /><br />If you like soft sophisticated ballads this is the album to consider. Give it a try and in time to come it will grow on your mind and you will be surprised to catch yourself from time to time humming the tunes.
0061733199|5.0|It tells you what to do in any condition, environment, or situation. It gives what to eat, not to eat, poisonous, venomous, and how to prepare. It went into my apocalypse bag!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is,  by far, the best version of mahjong. I've played quite a few versions and this one is the smoothest mahjong without question. The tiles are easy to differentiate and the zoom feature works well. If you like mahjong, then this is a must have app.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I found this app a while back and loved it in spite of the constant crashes.  It was good enough to make it worth dealing with the crashes.  A couple days later they released an update and no more crashes.  very accurate weather, and it shows you what the weather will be like through the day, hourly.  many other options.  Allows choices for obscure cities that aren't available on most apps.  satellite views and video weather also available.  everything you want in a weather app.  I installed it on my phone too.
B007BL6BG8|5.0|This is truly the best season yet! This is a great episode in which House pits collegue against collegue for Foreman's old job. Freakin' hilarious watching dog-eat-dog, but then again House and I have a lot in common!![[ASIN:B005KPDAUW House Season 8 Sneak Peek [HD]]]
1451627289|4.0|This is the first book by Stephen King I've REALLY liked in about a decade. It's written in the style I kept hoping he would return to using someday. It's hard to explain that style and put my finger on what's been missing, but whatever it is, it's BACK in this novel.  I wasn't even conceived yet when JFK was slain. I only knew the half-hour from high school history class basics: JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald; Mr. Oswald was killed by Jack Ruby. There were a lot of conspiracy theories that remain to this day. It's helpful if you know a bit more, but the entry for LHO in Wikipedia will easily cover the facts you need to know to enjoy the book. Stephen King didn't swim in the vast ocean of conspiracy-he only waded at the edge of that pool. Nor did he deviate wildly from the \\"official\\" facts as we know them (until you reach that penultimate moment during Jake/George's return to 1963, that is.) This is NOT a history book, and NOT a soapbox for King to dwell on the politics or rationales behind the desire to extend the life of JFK. It's not supposed to be. It IS supposed to be a should have/could have/would have NOVEL, and it's intended to be enjoyed as such.  While I wanted and wished for a different ending to the story, the story itself was delightful and fascinating. I'd recommend this one over several of his other recent books, but it never truly achieved that \\"un-put-downable\\" status for me. I'll still let friends know it's worth their time to read it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the different variety in the games and the option to replay your favorites to earn points to access other games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive and simple, what else can you ask for? Quantity and quality all in one package. Nothing but praise for your hard work!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|for a free game, pretty fun and addicting especially for a free game oh and the ads are definitely as people make them out to be
B002BWP49M|1.0|The point of this whole story is how important it is to have a weird boyfriend. I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my wife, and decided that its not that I \\"just don't get it\\". No, I get it completely. They tell of a girl that has it better than most middle class families. She is having a magical adventure, that if it wasn't for the sex this movie would only be for preteen girls. But all of this is my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but its not really cool that u have earn points to unlock different games but overall its really fun
0761169253|5.0|Austin Kleon's \\"Steal Like An Artist\\" is an exhilirating manifesto on owning your creativity. Original ideas don't come out of thin air. Embrace your influences and put them into your work. You don't have to consider yourself an artist to appreciate this fabulous little book -- any work will benefit from inspired creative thinking. \\"Steal Like An Artist\\" will get you there.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this app is very fun I find it to be very challenging but very entertaining. id recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the game.
B006ON41FC|4.0|My 7 year old will play this for hours and I have to MAKE her quit. I am not sure if adults would like it, but kids will.
1416960953|4.0|When it arrived, I loved how big and real it looked, almost as if it might be a real guide. I love the bookmark and the art, and the meticulous details, ranging from artifacts to beautiful art. Ever since The Field Guide I have wanted to see what Jared had, and it's wonderful!  I did not, however, see any movie tie-in in my edition, which makes me wonder if I received the correct one.  Another book that makes me love the Spiderwick Chronicle's even more!
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|For those of you considering purchasing a USB cable for your kindle fire for file transfer, you should take a look at this app and at least download the free version and try it out.<br /><br />I purchased this app because of the frustration of trying to use a USB cable to transfer content form my PC to my Kindle Fire. The cable I purchased originally worked fine, despite the problems that I have heard people discuss on the forums about them not working, and then out of the blue my cable stops working and my PC tells me it does not recognize the device. I tried several different methods to get the cable working again, looked through several forums, and was just about to give up when I came across someone mentioning the WiFi File Explorer app. At first I was very skeptical, but i figured it was worth the shot.<br /><br />I first downloaded the free version of this app, and needless to say was pleased. While it was a bit confusing at first with how it worked, and the free version only allowing transfer from kindle to PC, I found the ability to transfer files without the need of a cable very appealing and was excited to learn the full version was only 99 cents. I purchased and had no issues with transferring files from my PC to my Kindle.<br /><br />I sincerely wish I had known about this app before I purchased the cable, because it is a much cheaper investment than purchasing a cable (with even the cheap ones running around $6-$7). For about a buck I can wirelessly move any books, documents, and music files without much hassle. Overall, a great price on a product that does what a USB cable would do and more.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album freaking rocks! I would give it six stars if I could. When I first heard Tattoo it kind of worried me because I just didn't like it that much at the time and I thought the rest of the album would sound that way and boy was I wrong. I've loved Van Halen since I was 16 and I love a lot of the stuff with Sammy too, but having David Lee Roth back makes it so much better. I wish Michael Anthony was still in the band but Wolfie can play his butt off and is doing a heck of a job. I've heard some crybabies say that VH can't come up with anything original since a few of these songs are from old demos from the 70s, but Van Halen has always written that way. They have a huge backlog of unreleased material. Buy this and you won't be disappointed. At the time of this writing there are 28 one star reviews vs 326 five star reviews so it's safe to say that the overwhelming majority of folks who bought A Different Kind of truth know it's awesomeness just like I do. Most of the reviewers who gave it one star are just over-critical whiners who aren't happy unless they can find something to complain about. Also, I don't get the whole Van Halen vs Chickfoot thing, two different bands with two different sounds, let it go people.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|If you have watched 'Apocalypse now\\" and enjoyed, then this movie is for you.<br />Different story yet very close is many aspects. To name few similarities:<br />The music - the filming - The darkness in the story<br />A must watch
B004UHSB5A|5.0|I don't know why I bother reading these reviews, I love how Karen put it though. You said it best Karen! READ THE DAM INSTRUCTIONS PEOPLE! The game works great on my Nookcolor.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is so addicting!! if your thinking of getting it then your intentions are correct!!! I LOVE this game!!!!!!  too addicting....... just get it!
B0034G4P94|5.0|Simply put, it's a great great movie. Fans of all genres will enjoy this movie but action fans will really like it. The two brothers are 2 of 16 that are in a multi million dollar winner take all tournament, with each being relatively unknowns compared to the rest of the field comprised of the best MMA fighters in the world. We quickly learn Tom Hardys character is a true beast. I mean the very definition of \\"beast mode\\". Not wanting to tell what happens, I'll just say its a touching outcome, and a movie, especially anyone with brothers, will really enjoy. My top movie pick of 2011. Highly reccomended!
B006ON41FC|4.0|pretty nuts. i like nuts. addictive. wish that you had a goal besides nuts starting from begining over and over is nuts
B006PHD0RW|4.0|love this game....but after I got past the first level and completed &quot;Ultimate Bagger&quot; I became more disinterested in the other levels. I found they weren't as fun as the others.
B0071MV540|4.0|I really liked this movie. It is funny, there is suspense, you do not get bored, the actors are all really good actors anyway and they bring their talent to this movie.
0312323867|4.0|I love, love, love the way Emily Giffen writes and I wanted to love Something Borrowed. Maybe I am in the minority but I absolutely hated Rachel in the first book. Yes, Darcy was the mean, pretty girl we were all supposed to dislike. I spent the majority of the book thinking what a horrible person Rachel was for sleeping with her best friend's fiancee. I just could not feel sorry for her.She had all of these unresolved issues with Darcy and never just \\"broke up with her\\". I have a problem with affair being explained away because Darcy was not a good person. I am so happy that I gave Ms. Giffen a second chance and decided to read \\"Something Blue\\". I love this book so much more. Darcy completely redeems herself and becomes a better person.....<br />By the way, I still hate Rachel.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|THis unit is cheap  and you get cheap results.  When I transfered my Cassette to CD all tracks transfer as 1 track - this is not good but, as the old saying goes you get what you pay for.  Vender was prompt and the shipment was professionally done.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great version of the game with alot of different layouts and tile designs, it is definitly very fun and entertaining.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|This watch was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something classy yet comfortable for my boyfriend and that is what I received. It's easy to adjust the time and the numbers are clear and easy to read. The watch is a substantial piece.  To me, it makes it look more high end and of better quality. The stop watch works perfectly as well. Another plus is that you can take this watch from casual to dressy. If you're looking for a watch that's manly, classy, comfortable and easy to use, I'd give this watch a try.

0316017930|5.0|Outliers. What do you think of when you hear that term? Do you think of geniuses, legendary athletes, or famous musicians? Gladwell describes outliers as those who lie outside the realm of normality. In his book, Gladwell shows us that the gap between the genius and the average is not as wide as we might think. He theorizes that genius is not something we are born with its not something that is passed through genetics, it's something that only a accumulation of chance opportunities and sheer force of will can create. He starts with an example of Canadian hockey. This is where some of the world's most well known hockey players come from. Gladwell says that the reason the elite hockey players become elite is the day they were born. The elite ones are the oldest in their class thus they have had the most time to develop thus giving the illusion of innate talent. Gladwell next talks about Bill Gates, a \\"self made man\\". Gladwell explains that Bill Gates' success is just the result of a few lucky opportunities. Gladwell also talks about elite basketball players and the famous composer Beethoven. He says that what separates the good from the great are simply hours of practice. Gladwell states that the great players have reached 10,000 hours of practice built up over a period of years. Throughout Outliers Gladwell systematically analyzes the great outliers of the past and describes what it takes to have great success. At the end of the book, Gladwell argues that the majority of the contributing factors to success can be manipulated and controlled, and states that we as a society can manufacture genius via these controlled variables.

B004EPYZXK|3.0|I have been alive long enough to remember the entire Apollo program.  I remember watching the Apollo 17 manned lunar landing on television in 1972.  So maybe that helps me appreciate this movie a little more.  It brought back a lot of memories of watching the launches and dreaming of one day being an astronaut.<br /><br />Was this the best space movie I've seen? No - that would probably be [[ASIN:B00371QQ2U Apollo 13 (15th Anniversary Edition]].  Was this the best conspiracy movie I've seen?  No. Was this the best monster/alien movie I've seen? No.  There's too many better movies in these last two categories to even try listing them.  But I thought it was worth watching - if just to watch Warren Christie (he's my idea of a primo astronaut).
B0067Q42BY|5.0|i love this game. it's very easy to use, and it's a lot of fun, my son really enjoys it as well.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I didn't quite know what to expect when I started to watch this 2011 version of \\"The Thing.\\"  I have always loved monster/alien movies and the 1982 version with Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley is one of my all-time favorites.  I can't even begin to guess how many times I have watched that one.<br /><br />So -- this \\"prequel\\" to that movie...I liked it.  I thought it offset the original version very well.  Did I enjoy it as much?  No, but it did have its moments.<br /><br />Mild spoiler alert:  I liked the largely Norwegian cast.  I liked the alien special effects.  I liked the spaceship scenes.<br /><br />I missed Russell and Brimley (they definitely \\"made\\" the earlier version for me). I think that it was a very smart idea in this movie to have a female protagonist - one that wouldn't \\"compete\\" with Russell.  But I think this is a fair prequel and I don't think it detracts from the 1982 version.  They both have their strengths and storyline.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I made it two months without dropping my phone, so I figured I'd earned the right to graduate from my otterbox defender to a prettier, yet still functional case for my snazzy white iphone.  And at $9, what better way to show off the beautiful design of the white iphone and still protect it.  I was impressed by the film for the front, as I was switching from an otterbox defender (which has a screen shield built in), but it went on without a hitch, was impressively thick, and I can't see it now at all.  In any case, price, design, and protection level were all right on this one - great purchase!
B0034G4OUY|4.0|\\"Faster\\" reminded me of some of the old Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns.  Lighting, cinematography, the fact that Dwayne Johnson hardly speaks in the movie.  Is that bad?  Depends on whether you liked the Sergio Leone films.  I liked \\"Faster\\" a lot.<br /><br />Fast-paced vigilante action, a drugged-up cop played very well by Billy Bob Thornton, a laundry list of people that are being killed to avenge the death of a brother, car chases, a very quirky hit man and his girlfriend, good cop/bad cop - this all ties together in an exciting movie about revenge and killing and the effects and aftereffects of both.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the alternate ending with the director's explanation.  Both endings work - I enjoyed the alternate the most.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I'll admit I wasn't Steve Jobs biggest fan even though I admired the beauty of his products and attention to detail. I hated how hard it was to get the songs on my iPod and how hard it was to tweak my iPhone. Still I got the book, regardless of my opinion about the products Steve Jobs was the one who made and I was interested to know how!  The book immediately invited me into his world. Author really explained the character development of Steve - her dug deep to answer all of the questions I had. In some points I so mesmerized the by description of Steve and his \\"reality distortion field\\" that I started to try and act like him in my business. Needless to say if you want to imitate- imitate something good, I was just too intoxicated by the book (yes it is that good)!  For everybody who wants to put the dent in universe - I suggest this incredibly inspiring book!

B006PZBR8S|3.0|This movie was like pouring \\"Rocky\\" and \\"Over the Top\\" into a blender and pressing liquify on the panel.... a popular premise that has worked very well in the past, and don't get me wrong, I liked it, but the acting was very emotionless and wooden which killed any emotional investment in it for me. I found it odd that Max never even tried to call Charlie \\"Dad\\" and Charlie never really tried to connect with his son. That made his \\"one last chance\\" at the end ring false to me and then to have all the characters at ringside at the end was just too cheesy.  All in all, I could see most kids really liking this flick and it does have some mediocre entertainment value so I will call this movie \\"OK\\"...

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I ordered this DVD set knowing it was a bare-bones edition and received basically what I expected. All films have a menu with scene selections and all discs have nice cover art (no black disk like another reviewer had).<br /><br />Here's a full list of all the other minor features:<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone<br />-English and Spanish language and Subs<br />-Cast and crew list (really, just a list)<br />-Teaser and theatrical trailer<br /><br />Chamber of Secrets<br />-Same as Sorcerer's Stone except additional French Subtitles and short recap of first movie<br /><br />Prisoner of Azkaban<br />-English, Spanish, and French language and Subs<br />-Cast and crew list<br />-theatrical trailers for first 3 movies<br /><br />Goblet of Fire<br />-English and Spanish language and Subs + French subs<br /><br />Order of the Phoenix<br />-English, Spanish, and French language and subs + English subs for the hearing impaired<br /><br />Half-Blood Prince<br />-Same as Order of the Phoenix minus French language and subs<br /><br />Deathly Hallows Part 1<br />-English (subs only for hearing impaired) and Spanish language and subs<br />-5 additional scenes<br /><br />Deathly Hallows Part 2<br />-English(subs only for hearing impaired), Spanish, and French language and subs<br />-8 additional scenes<br /><br />As for the films themselves? All awesome, personally I think the last two films are the best due to the improved acting for all the main cast, Alexandre Desplat's incredible musical score, and of course the darker, more engaging storyline.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|I loved this album on vinyl, back in the 80's. I bought it lately on CD. It holds up quite well as time goes by. \\"In The Mood\\" and \\"Big Log\\" are my favorites, but I like the whole album very much. Live versions of \\"In The Mood\\", \\"Thru With The Two Step\\", \\"Lively Up Yourself\\", and a studio version of \\"Turnaround\\" are the Bonus Tracks. If your not familiar with it, check it out. It's good stuff!!
0385512058|5.0|This book goes into the Top 10 Must Reads that I recommend to everyone in every profession. The principles of \\"connecting\\" strike a nerve of truth that gives power to the actionable steps the author suggests. I love the new vocabulary that this book gives us in reference to networking.<br /><br />Essentially we learn in this book that relationships are our greatest assets and that our best relationships are those in which we create high value for people we care about. This is the skill that must be honed. Caring about more people and discovering how we can create more value for them.
0385737955|4.0|Recently, I read the book Maze Runner. The book is excellently constructed, with a paperback cover and pleasing, lustrous sheen when held under light. The pages are authentic paper and have the optimum tactile quality, as one would expect from a book of this vintage. While I thought the book was constructed well overall, it was lacking any \\"old-library, musty book\\" smell that I have come to know and love from books of this fine calibre. Thus my reading experience was somewhat distracted by this fact. The title, summary and author's name are written in an extremely pleasing font, a variant of Minion Pro I do believe. The book designer's alternating use of red and white color swatches with the text is quite masterful, I am surprised it has not been commended by any of my peers in their respective book reviews. The bar code, ISBN number and copyright information are expertly placed with the craft of an artisan bookmaker; I nearly wept at the sight of those alternating black lines. The font of the text itself was marvelous, though the inadequate spacing throughout the novel left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Speaking of taste, DO NOT PUT THIS BOOK IN YOUR MOUTH. Obviously the bookmaker did not take this vital component of the novel into consideration, leaving me with the taste of burnt glue all over my tongue. Overall, The Maze Runner is an excellent book with the utmost quality in its craftsmanship. I can only hope that the author will continue this fabulous work.
B000002B2T|4.0|I tell you people I forgot just how good this album really was. Back when it first came out I had not purchased a CD player (young and didn't save money very efficiently)  so I had this on cassette. Fast forward almost 20 odd years and I now have 600 CD players strung through two houses and a multitude of vehicles (an exageration of course) I happen upon it on Amazon and think to myself, yeah, I think that was good if memory serves me. So I buy it and I can say that with out a doubt this is a great little album.  The thing is that it lacks some of the \\"polish\\" of certain studio recordings but those little nuances make this more of a boutique album from the late great \\"Nineties Seattle Sludge\\" that was grunge.  River of Decepit tells a tale for what I am sure is a page torn right from the book of Layne Staley's short and ultimately tragic life. He was a fantastic singer and songwriter. He knew just how to captivate his audience. His lyrics were like \\"Junkie Poetry\\" Don't get me wrong, I don't condone the lifestyle or the self destructiveness that usually accompanies being a junkie and their lives are far from poetic but he seemed to almost be telling cautionary tales of woe because he was living it right then and there.  This album, for Layne, is a somewhat softer side and tonealy different from his Alice In Chains offerings. Let's not forget that Mike McCready (of Pearl Jam fame)Barrett Martin (Screaming Trees)and John Baker Saunders (The Walkabouts) were the other major driving forces behind this album. That's quite a pedigree to have on one album. I guess I always loved the comradery that the Seattle bands seemed to have with one another and they all seemed happy for their contemporaries successes.  The first 5 songs are in my opinion the best. Only 5 you say, well think of it like this, how many musicians would kill for 5 hit songs on one album? I tell you how many . . . All of them.  Wake up - The sting of a love affair gone sour, X-ray Mind - The slow burn of distrust, River of Decepit - I believe it is self decepit, I'm Above - a great punk vibe, Artificial Red - a Slow blues fueled A** Kicker  You'll likely never hear much music like this again and sadly two of the four men here are dead, due to heavy drug use and the overdoses that accompanied both of their last trips. R. I. P. Layne and J.B. and if you liked ninties grunge, here you go, in a very pure form from 4 vastly different influences \\"Mad Season\\" ABOVE.
B001IF252M|5.0|This adapter shipped from Amazon and was delivered as expected.  It is a true Apple branded product and worked fine.  All the packaging included typical Apple logos and disclaimers and the product itself looked like a typical Apple product.  If it is a knockoff, as some have suggested, it is a very good one.  I ordered this adapter to hook one of our company executive's MacBook Air to our main conference room projector (Epson).  After receiving the adapter, I plugged it into the notebook and into the projector and everything worked without any issues.  I think I had to go to the settings and have the notebook detect the new display before it showed on the projector but that was easy.  So, for our need, this adapter worked perfectly.  Regards
B004MC8CA2|4.0|With the Bible app, I have increased my time in God's Word multiple times over. Waiting at the doctor's. office, in line at the grocery store, any spare moment can now be full of God.  For the Kindle Fire, I greatly recommend downloading at least one version of the Bible immediately. Otherwise, you won't be able to use the app when away from wifi coverage. Also, reading plans aren't available without internet connectivity. I have the Bible app on my phone as well so that I don't have to worry about that, but if your only Bible app capable device is a Kindle or tablet, you should be prepared for which features won't be fully functional.
B000002LEM|2.0|I like all incarnations of VH (yes, even Cherone)...but this album is weak.  The best song on it, imo, is 'When It's Love' which, let's face it, is not a hard rocking' tune.  It's good, but a bit sappy.  'Cabo Wabo' is okay, but drags on forever.  'Black and Blue' is solid, but lacks energy.  'Feels So Good'...how about feels so lame.  There are three high energy songs ('Source of Infection,' 'AFU,' and 'Sucker in a 3 Piece') but the chorus in all three is bad, imo.  'AFU' is the best of the bunch, and is almost good, but...not quite.  'Mine All Mine' starts off nicely, but the chorus is bland and tuneless, completely ruining any hope for this song.  Finally, 'Finish What Ya Started' is not bad...but not that good, either.<br /><br />In the end, this is simply my opinion and we all know music is strictly subjective, but in my very subjective opinion, this is the most lifeless VH album ever made.  I listened to it several times when I first bought it back in 1988, and again recently in an effort to find something I like about it...and it's just not there.  I would recommend this album only if you are a die-hard Van Hagar/Sammy Hagar fan.  For the rest of us, I would recommend passing on this.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The characters in this book catch you  by the collar and won't let go as they weave their way through the twist and plots. They take you along for the ride! Mystery and suspense shrouds some characters and leads your mind down a trail you have to back track from later in the story. Motives are unclear, powers shift and at every corner there is another surprise. I know this is a very generalized review but I am always afraid of giving too much away if I start talking about the story itself and it's characters. But Sophia is not who she thought she was, or rather she is except not when or rather every time she was....ummm okay enough about Sophia. Friends and enemies overlap....and some friends become enemies without intention...oh the things we do for love. Powers that have been, powers that are and powers that will be. The only thing in the whole story that disappointed me was the damn red bird. I had so much believed he was a much more crucial player in the game. Perhaps he will return in the next one??? What say you Rebecca? Can you spin that bird around?  I highly recommend this book!
B005UPOAT2|4.0|*Spoiler Alert*  I am a movie buff.  I am not ashamed to say that I do NOT have a problem watching the occasional \\"chick flick\\" as well.  This is one of those \\"feel-good\\" movies.  Personally, I was routing for the couple in question to get together, etc.  Needless to say, I was happy when they were finally able to be together ... nice climax, etc.  I received this disc in great shape, and in a timely manner.  Great service.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I finished reading American Sniper weeks ago but waited to write my opinion until I was less emotional.  As a wife of a Viet Nam veteran I appreciated reading about the stress active duty puts on families and the conflict that results.  We are generations apart but have dealt with the same frustrations. American Sniper gives a clear picture of how SEAL snipers are utilized in battles and the stress of training. It's worth the money!!!

B00004XPPC|1.0|I have visited the site of this POW camp 3 times in Ganjanaburi, Thailand. Each year there is a memorial that reenacts the bombing with a light & firecracker show. The truth is that the bridge, actually rather short, was bombed by Allied planes - not by a bomb created by the prisoners. I also visited the war memorial museum there that had actual photos as well as drawings & written testimonials by the prisoners. They were emaciated, starved, covered in sores & dispirited. One prisoner wrote that the only relief they had from the sores was going into the river and having the fish feed off the scabs & blood. The Japanese officers were brutal, overworked the POW's and punished them harshly on a whim. I also visited the nearby POW cemetery that was full of Allied solders who died at this camp. I had watched this movie several times before going to Thailand & enjoyed it for what it was - it's well done & suspenseful and dealt with interesting ethical issues, such as the need to sacrifice one's personal achievement for the greater good. I wish the movie was promoted as pure fiction & set in another WWII site like China or the Philippines. I understand that movies often take real events & change the facts when making a movie but this is like depicting the Bataan Death March as a Parade! Unfortunately, the movie portrays the POW's as healthy,well-fed, with high morale, & able to negotiate working conditions with the Japanese as if the POW's were unionized, who initially sabotage the bridge-building without suffering the cruel response of the Japanese. In one scene, the hero POW, with a grin, insults the chief Japanese officer and the officer drives off looking embarrassed. Never would happen. The POW would be immediately put into some cruel cell or be killed on the spot. To depict the POW's as a carefree bunch, splashing & laughing in the river & having the power to demand human rights from the Japanese insult & disgrace the real POW's who suffered & died there, unable to receive human rights, & cruelly treated by their captors. BTW, the river is actually named Kwae like quack; Kwai means water buffalo.

0439023491|4.0|This book is a great book to read because it can make your emotions go along with the books actions.  It can make you feel mad or angry at one moment and then makes you feel excited and anxious  on what is about to happen next.  Catching Fire is the second out of the three books of the Hunger Games series.  It picks off right where the first book leaves and takes of more excited adventures and danger.  Katniss, a teenage girl from district 12 survives the first hunger games and is faced with the rebellion of the Capital and the other districts following too.  This takes a spin on the country of Panem also shows how people can make a difference and be in charge for once.  Once Katniss and her so called lover Peeta finds out what the next Quarter Quell has to come they are in shock as well as their country.  In Catching Fire there is never a dull moment knowing whats going to happen next.  There is a lot of fighting and supernatural causes by the Gamemakers in the Capital.  The book makes you feel like you are a part in it and that you care about the characters and their emotions.  In the first book Katniss is referred to the girl on fire, but here in the second book it quotes \\"This is no place for a girl on fire\\" Katniss thinks.  I believe that the ending was confusing and was lefted a big cliff hanger but I guess that's why there is a third book to the series.  Hopefully it can give us some clues why Catching Fire ended the way it did.  This is a great series of books and think that doesn't matter how old or young you are, you will enjoy this book.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This novel is unusually well written- If Hamilton was the first writer to break into vampire and paranormal literature, she would have busted the doors wide open and made it difficult for other writers to surpass her writing style. She paints pictures with words like I have never read before and writes as if she is a well seasoned old author who has been doing this all her life. The funny thing is, she isn't - she is a young author and I am completely astounded at the level of work she is producing. The only unfortunate thing about this particular piece of work is that it does trail behind all of the current popular vampire/paranormal books that are out there. What I mean to say is that although she does incorporate new characters/elements and creates a truly unique story- the subject matter is so closely related to an over-saturated market that it could possibly get lost in the pile, which would be unfortunate. If I met someone who has never read Twilight or Anne Rice or any other popular book in this genre- I would tell them to start with The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton, because it really does lead the pack with literary genius. I am one of the few people who couldn't get passed the first chapter of Twilight because although I loved the story, the writing is appalling...and that is after they hired a copyediter to correct the immature writings of Meyer. The Forever Girl is a perfect example of a well written self-published book that the public can trust to provide a compelling story with writing precision.  If you are a person who can recognize a brilliant new author, then please check her out. I look forward to reading more literature from her with hopefully a new subject, since she is the type of writer to have the talent to create her own genre.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|First, I would like to say, if you are having doubts, or if this album does not give you the good vibes you had longed for, I suggest you head over to Spotify and listen to the bonus commentary. Nate, Jack and Andrew do a remarkably admirable job explaining their process of molding and building each track off of the new album. I believe an artist's interpretation of his or her own work is the most important step in forming fair, educated, justified criticisms.  Change is inevitable, and I will agree, change is not always a positive thing. The transcendence into new genres and the introduction of new technical elements are often difficult to grasp, but don't be so quick to pass this album off as a poorly produced, \\"sell-out\\" attempt. Some Nights is like Aim and Ignite's younger, funkier brother. The lyrical value of Some Nights is almost as strong as Aim & Ignite, the presentation, though, is completely opposite. Each track possesses something different and something unexpected. The use of auto-tune does not overpower or take anything away from Nate's pure, raw, untouched vocals. In fact, the effects are only representative of how diversified the guys of fun. are musically.  Some Nights, for me, is inspiring and uplifting. After my first listen to the complete album, I was reduced to tears. The tears came before I even listened to it, actually. It's difficult for me to summarize the feelings I have for this band and this album without brainless gushing, which I am sure this is anyway. I've just never been affected by something so honest, so genuine as fun. There are not enough adjectives to describe how proud I am of these guys. Popularity or not, they have always been successful to me and they always will, talent untouched.
0307346617|4.0|Purchasing \\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War\\", I was expecting a certain type of book - one that I was gleefully looking forward too. Even the author's name implies a level of parody, satire and zaniness. The silly, fun part of me was looking forward to this book immensely.  After the first few chapters, I realized that this was not the book I was expecting. But the history and political dork inside of me loved it. Instead of set pieces of surreal lunacy (of which there are a few), the book mainly focuses on an exceptionally reasoned and logical examination of what would happen if a plague began that turned people into zombies. First person interviews, with flashes of comic asides and witty juxtapositions, form a patchwork of stories that describe a world collapse that vividly describe the breakdown of our global civilization. I found it to be a very savvy, very human portrayal of a ridiculous subject taken very seriously.  If you substituted any world-wide epidemic fear instead of \\"zombies\\" in this book, i think you would find the story playing out the same way, and I really appreciated that aspect of the novel. While there are several outstanding action set pieces that describes seriously terrifying scenarios of zombie attacks (I loved the Indian Ocean race to the cruise ship), the most enjoyable parts of the book is how people reacted to an extiniction-level event and how current global government structures would react to these events (told through how those reactions effected people). Vividly and economically drawn characters make this book really identifiable and was an entertaining and enlightening read. Which wasn't what I anticipated, but I'm still very happy about that!
B002VECM4A|5.0|Movie was very good, however some of the language could have been cut out.  Over all I would recommend it to others, but warn them of the language.

0316056863|5.0|I listened to the audiobook, which was read by Tina Fey.  I think her telling me the story was much better than if I would have read it.  It was so funny - especially for a woman/mom.  She brought me back to the finer days where biker shorts were cool and you got to learn a little behind the scenes of SNL.  Highly recommend!

B006TJXZ30|2.0|I was excited to see this app finally available.  I installed it on my Iconia A500 and it worked very well until I rebooted.  I then got a string of application failure popups and the widget would not initialize.  I also found I couldn't edit any contact info.  I had to go through a number of Force Closes until I uninstalled it.  I'm hoping for a patch soon so I can retry it.

B004UHSB5A|3.0|This is the caassic game of dominoes I remember playing with my grandma for hours. So I have a lot of domino experience. I didn'thave any issues with positioning the tiles on my Nook Tablet. I thought they were too small. And it does seem to me that the computer always has a winning hand. In every hand I played, the computer had the double5 every time except once. Doesn't quite sound as random as I would expect.... Make the tiles bigger and show less favor to the computer and this will be a very nice little game.

B007B8GI28|5.0|I've seen a lot of reviews with people complaining about how slow this season has been in comparison to the last and how tired they are of the \\"character development\\".  I have loved this season for the same reason so many are upset with it. Yeah my heart isn't beating out of my chest from the action packed zombie apocalypse epicness, but I'm loving watching these characters actually breathe and deal with more personal issues.  This episode had the perfect combination of thrilling action and character arc. Every shot was gorgeous. Big kudos to the director and cinematographer for making it so good that we don't miss a beat. Really amazing Zombie gruesomeness. **SPOILER** That zombie squeezing it's face through the broken glass. EEWWWW!! And I mean that in the best way possible!! **END SPOILER**  I'm interested to see how the show writers deal with the psycho Shane situation. I know they said they'd follow the outlined path of the graphic novels but they did say every once in a while they'd head off in their own direction for a bit...  Gotta say though, I really want to like Lori but so far she is my least favorite.
B004UHSB5A|2.0|How do you expect people to pay for an app that doesn't work properly? Once the glitches start (as many have already identified), the scoring is wrong! What a shame!
B004UHSB5A|3.0|It works. That's the only good thing I can say about it. The tiles are waaaaay too small. I have a 10&quot; tablet, and there is a lot of real estate. Make the tiles scaleable.

0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers is a great book about the outliers of success. Gladwell discusses several things throughout the book that are direct factors to success, such as hard work, opportunities, and - believe it or not - your ethnicity. Talent by itself will not get you to where you want to be in life. Hard work by itself will not get you where you want to be in life. Opportunities by themselves will not get you where you want to be in life. But if you combine talent, a good work ethic, opportunities, and being born or growing up at the right time, can lead you to a very successful life. Gladwell discusses cases like Bill Gates, who only became the founder of Microsoft because of several lucky breaks in his life, one being that he lived just minutes away from Washington University, who happened to be giving out free computer hours during the early 70's.   From beginning to end, this is a great book. Gladwell backs up every single one of his claims with legitimate sources, and a lot of these sources are esteemed psychologists who have done extensive research in success, heritage, culture, and work ethic. From Asians being good at math to hockey players being born in January to IQ's over 120 being indiscriminate, Gladwell takes a great in-depth look at what it really takes to being successful. I highly recommend this book because it has affected me even since I began reading it. I found myself flipping through the pages faster than I could imagine, all while enjoying the book immensely. I hope others can enjoy Outliers as much as I did.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. It downloaded quickly and without any problems. It seemed to play okay until I was on an end and instead of just covering up the existing piece, it actually began to build backwards over the other pieces on the board that were still in play. Minus 1 star. Then there is no exit feature &amp; using the &quot;back&quot; button takes you out of the game, but doesn't close the game. It is still running in the background. Minus another star. For me, I don't like it. I'll be unistalling. I'd rather go to the store &amp; buy a pack of dominoes than to try &amp; play this game anymore.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I just watched this movie (got it from Netflix) and I thought it was really great.  I wasn't expecting too much from it since I remembered it getting mixed reviews in the theater, but this is my kind of movie.  I's saw that it earned it's five star rating.<br /><br />Josh

0553801473|1.0|I am sick of waiting years for books to come out.  I dont want this to turn into another wheel of time which 2 years after the author died still has at least 2 more books to go.<br /><br />I have seen that this series which was supposed to be 4 books from the start has now grown to 7.  7!!!!  really.  And there is no way to tell if that is it.<br /><br />Authors need to STOP MILKING THE SERIES FOR MONEY and write the words THE END.<br /><br />Look at McKiernan.  8 or 9 books in the series but each one is its own seperate story.<br /><br />I refuse to buy another book in this series until the words THE END have been written.  And by that time the books which I havent read will be 2 cents apiece on Amazon plus $3 for shipping or at a used book store or yard sale for $1.<br /><br />A lot better than pay $10 or so for a part of the story which doesnt go anywhere.
030788743X|5.0|This book was highly addictive. I couldn't put it down.Reliving the 80's through games, movies, and song. This book has a dystopian society, Internet like world, love and friendship and of course action,action, and more action. Get this book--you won't be disappointed
055357342X|4.0|A Storm of Swords is noticably better than it's predecessor, A Clash of Kings. It's faster paced, with a number of climactic points during the course of the novel, and after the set-up in the previous book the plotting of each individual character goes along much quicker.  Again, political intrigue takes centre stage. The battle scenes here are more polished than in A Clash of Kings, and have their own set of politicking involved. Characterisation is still crucial to how well the book reads, but with quicker plot development the less interesting characters are more readable. Additionally, there's alot of character development, with considerable depth added to several characters.  There were a number of emotionally moving segments of the story (\\"you know nothing\\" in particular got me), and several stunning twists and turns that left me distressed. One of these is on par with the climax of A Game of Thrones, and occurs about two thirds of the way through A Storm of Swords - personally, I think this scene eclipses the Game of Thrones climax.  There's still a feeling of a middle book to Storm of Swords. A number of characters are still in flux, moving about, and whether you like them are not will determine how interested you are in these sections.  The plotting is quicker and more tightly-woven, though not as fast as a Game of Thrones. The narrative is more focused, and mostly back to showing character point-of-views only when there's something to be told. There's also alot of set-up, which can be arduous, but at least there's a certain amount of pay-off.  Another thing which is quickly becoming a problem is predictability. It's a hard world, and ruthless, so there's a certain amount of give which can reasonably be allowed to this, but it's fairly obvious that when the protagonists do something which might be considered good that something bad will happen as a result. Martin throws in enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes, so it's often still interesting to read to find out exactly how things will play out, but some things can be predicted well enough. It's somewhat of a suspense killer, but if you're not too cynical about it it's still enjoyable.  If things keep going in this direction, the next few books should be good.  4.5/5
B006M4RN3U|4.0|fun.'s sophomore album is different sound than their first album in many respects. First, there is a much heavier electronic emphasis on this album. There aren't as many \\"light\\" songs from the first album like \\"All The Pretty Girls\\" or \\"Take Your Time.\\" However, songs from this album, such as \\"We are Young,\\" \\"Carry On,\\" and \\"Out on the Town\\" are definitely high quality tracks that deserve attention. The other songs are good, but these few are high-caliber songs. I recommend this album to any fun. fan that is open to a change in sound, because if you aren't, you probably will not like this album. I give this a four star rating because I feel that there aren't as many quality tracks as there were on \\"Aim and Ignite.\\" However, it's hard to compare to \\"Aim and Ignite,\\" so I'll leave it to you to judge for yourself.
0316017930|5.0|I would very much recommend Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell to anyone willing to read it. It gave me a new perspective on life that I don't think I ever would have thought about without reading this book first. Gladwell introduces us to a whole new outlook on success and how we go about obtaining success. He explains why being born in the right month could make you a hockey star, why which country you came from determines how good of a pilot you'd be, and why family background has a lot more to do with who you are than we'd probably think.   This book is not the typical four characters, one plot, and one storyline, kind of a book. Gladwell divides his book into two sections to look closer at opportunity, and cultural legacies. Each chapter is a different storyline, with different characters, and different reasons behind success. This is what makes his book so distinctive.   Gladwell also explains why Asians are typically so much better at math, and why persistence is so important to our education in the long run, which may come in handy for college students, like me. Being persistent means completing homework or a math problem, no matter how hard it may seem. The more persistent we are, the more successful we will become.   Gladwell also talks about why summer breaks may or may not be beneficial to students, depending on which economic class their family falls under. He gives us many, many examples of where success may come from, but the biggest and most important thing we need to understand is that success ultimately comes from things that are out of our control; from the opportunities we are given throughout our lives.   So yes, I would recommend Outliers to anybody interested in learning more about where success comes from, and why. This book may even persuade you to take a look at your own life and how the things in your past have made you more successful today. It opens up a whole new realm of ideas, ones that most people have never even taken into account, and that, I believe, is why this book is so interesting.
B004UHSB5A|5.0|Great passtime game, and very nice to get an app that dosen't require you to give up an ounce of privacy to install!

0385534639|3.0|... where fantasy and reality merge into one? What is magic, if not \\"a different way of seeing\\" the reality around us? Erin Morgenstern's debut novel, The Night Circus, delves into these somewhat philosophical questions in a highly original and playful way.  Much has been said in the 800 plus amazon reviews to date about the novel's strengths and weaknesses, about the story and the characters... It is better to say little about the content and the protagonists and even better not to read reviews before reading this unusual work of fiction so that each reader can explore its 'otherworld'.  For me, The Night Circus is one of those novels that you either take to from the beginning or you don't, and even if your curiosity keeps you reading to the end (as mine did), you may never quite immerse yourself into this world that is created for you, however imaginative and imaginary it may be. If you are happy to follow the story into this other reality, then everything will fall into place and/or you will happily suspend disbelief if things don't quite fit together.<br /><br />As the title suggests, at the centre stands (or does it float?) a circus that only operates by night. \\"It can appear out of nowhere\\", changes at some body's whim and it also disappears without warning. Mystery and magic surround the locality and the many tents that comprise the circus. Real life, such as it is relevant, does exist and those living there have more or less knowledge of the details that make the circus into what it is and its underlying purpose. Few can escape its \\"magic\\", however...<br /><br />There is little doubt that Morgenstern deserves praise for her rich imagination in terms of the overall theme, her writing that can reach brilliance when conveying the atmosphere that envelops the circus and its various acts. The novel's structure is simple at the surface, yet essential for the development of the narrative and the wealth of characters that the author introduces. Still, I found that her central characters are less well developed than some of the secondary ones; they appear to illustrate one particular aspect of the dynamic that is the essence of the circus's existence rather than coming across as fully-fledged individuals.  Overall it was only a partly satisfying read and the ending seemed less organic than it could have been.

1250006341|4.0|This is a beautiful book that fans of the \\"Downton Abbey\\" television series will adore. In addition to hundreds of beautiful photos, the book contains backstory on the show's production and the characters, behind the scenes info, and factual details about life was like in Britain 100 years ago. I particularly enjoyed reading the details about what the life of servants was actually like back then.  Overall, if you're a fan of the TV show, I'm sure you will enjoy the companion book.

1469984202|5.0|I picked this up based on the other reviews here and the fact that the Ombnibus is generously priced at only $5 for Kindle.  No regrets, and frankly the $5 price is a steal for us readers.  The story becomes more engrossing volume by volume, even though the focus of each segment often moves to new or different characters.  I did feel the action and tension slipped oh-so-slightly at the end, but that doesn't change the fact that Howey's done a great job of fleshing out interesting protagonists and antagonists, as well as a \\"new world\\" that's fascinating to explore (level by level, as it were).  I certainly hope there's more to come from the world of Wool.

B00008BRDX|5.0|One could tell The Police would become a big deal after [[ASIN:B00008BRBG Outlandos D'Amour]] hit big that this trio would really be going places. It would've been so easy in this musically uneasy time to xerox their debut album on almost every level. Well not only did they expand on what they'd begun with,but also altered their production style to a big degree. Now their punk rock influences were not totally shed off on this album. But the emphasis with the guitars starting with this album is generally more rhythmic based. With a title translating to something like \\"Reggae Of White (if my French is correct),that is explored a lot. Not only that but the strong jazz influences on both Sting and Copeland begin to come out quite a lot more here. But most important is the production. This is where that reverbed echoed gloss in their sound first began to appear. Also they make a lot more of the space between the middle of their songs,the silences or rests than on the lead solos for the most part. Of course this album didn't quite have the same obvious pop type hits of the debut. But in the places where that first album enlivened and excited,this more or less penetrated.<br /><br />  The two biggest hit songs \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"Walking On The Moon\\" have more brooding melodies to them and have this slight feeling of ennui to them,rather brooding too. On the title song,\\"It's Alright For You\\",\\"Deathwish\\",\\"The Beds Too Big Without You\\" and \\"No Time This Time\\" that sense of uncertainty still defines the songs. Sting is beginning to become very analytical here as these numbers keep something of a ska/rock rhythm to them. This album really kicks up with it's fusions however. Another famous tune here \\"Bring On The Night\\",with it's nasty grooving bass riff and it's funky jazz/reggae fusion and it's one of my favorites here. That style is returned to on \\"Contact\\" as well. Copeland also gets a couple songs here. One of them is the more pop/rock type number of \\"On Any Other Day\\",with a lyric regarding a husband wanting to basically jump out of his body when his family offer him too many shocking surprises in one day. And it does have a strong wit to it even if Copeland isn't the strongest of singers. He also brings in \\"Does Everybody Stare\\",something of a piano based swinging jazz/reggae type fusion.<br /><br />  Lyrically there's a lot of intellectual angst on this album. This also likely contributes to the music's somewhat darker flavor. It doesn't quite possess the same youthful enthusiasm they had early on. There's this sense of reality becoming somewhat more important than been major creative forces. True each of these guys knew they'd wind up making a good deal of money as they progressed and got better. But the overall sense of this album seemed to be based somewhat in that old sellout/non-sellout concept. Basing the album more heavily in reggae and jazz aspects of their sound,as well as slickening up the production style significantly was probably an important step in the right direction in this regard as well. After this album The Police would in fact make significant headway toward a more commercial sound. And more or less become a musically innovative mainstream rock band as opposed to a musically innovative band capable of being hitmakers. At the same time the basic production style of this album sets the tone for the one the band would use for the rest of their career.lyric regarding a husband wanting to basically jump out of his body when his family offer him too many shocking surprises in one day.

B006OV7RQ4|5.0|Guess what, everyone? The younger sister of the Olsen twins can act, and she's really good! That seemed to be one of the big takeaways from last year's Martha Marcy May Marlene, which has already won several awards from critics societies and is currently nominated for four Indie Spirit awards. But Elizabeth Olsen wasn't the only one making an impressive first impression; the haunting psychodrama about a young woman who escapes a cult and attempts to piece her life back together in the aftermath is also the debut of writer-director Sean Durkin. Cutting seamlessly between the past and present, Durkin brings the viewer into his heroine's crippling paranoia, which grows increasingly worse until it becomes unclear what reality is and what her mind has fabricated. Martha Marcy May Marlene is an effective thriller that creeps up on you and stays with you for days.

B004A8ZWWO|2.0|Eddie Murphy's made a lot of bad films in the past couple of decades, and it's officially old hat to wax nostalgic about the glory days of Beverly Hills Cop and Coming to America. And while it would have been easy to dismiss Tower Heist as a probable bomb due to its outlandish premise, seemingly mismatched cast, and critically unimpressive director, well, it turned out to be another of 2011's pleasant surprises, thanks in large part to Murphy himself. The story centers on a group of luxury apartment employees who lose their pensions in a Ponzi scheme to a businessman and decide to take back what's theirs by ripping him off in an elaborate, well, tower heist. Aided by a star-studded cast that included Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Tea Leoni, Casey Affleck, and Gabourey Sidibe, Tower Heist represented a return to form for Eddie Murphy. It's a fun little popcorn movie that'll probably do a decent job of keeping you entertained on a Saturday night.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|I've lived with many of these albums for decades--first as LPs back in the early 1960s and then as CDs. But hearing these discs is like hearing them--REALLY hearing them--for the first time. The experience is just phenomenal. So far I've listened to 37 of the discs, and I just continue to marvel at what the Sony team has accomplished. No more problems with Dynagroove. No more problems with Dynaflex. I couldn't recommend this set more highly. (The book that comes with the set is also very beautiful.)
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Based on the downward trajectory of the Shrek franchise, particularly over its final two installments, one wouldn't have expected much from a spinoff film starring one of the peripheral characters. Puss in Boots, therefore, was a pleasant surprise for me. Starring Antonio Banderas as the voice of the titular feline, Puss is sort of a prequel to the Shrek films, following the adventures of its swashbuckling star as he teams up with Humpty Dumpty and Kitty Softpaws to take on Jack and Jill for their magical beans. Bubbling with wry wit, visual sparkle, and effervescent charm, Puss in Boots helps restore some luster to the Shrek universe. You won't see anything especially new or thought-provoking here, but you'll probably have a pretty good time nonetheless.

These are tales of two lady detectives and their interactions with the folks around them in Botswana. The characters are entertaining, and the stories are very gentle and calming - quite refreshing for the soul.
B006OFN0SE|1.0|Here's a film that had all the makings of an award-winner, if not a modern classic: an acclaimed director, an award-winning screenwriter, an all-star cast and a compelling subject. Somehow, though, the final product managed to be less than the sum of its parts. So what was the problem? There are a few. While the actors all offered up top notch performances, poor lighting and subpar makeup took away from the aesthetics of the film, while a confusing narrative and humdrum storytelling diminished any impact it might have otherwise had. As far as biopics go, you'll certainly learn a little bit about Mr. Hoover from J. Edgar, but because the story fails to explore some of the more interesting aspects of his character from any significant angle, you may find it all a little mundane and uninspiring.

B006ISJQ26|1.0|William Monahan is best known as the screenwriter for a few big movies, including Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven and Body of Lies, and Martin Scorsese's The Departed, for which Monahan won a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. For London Boulevard, Monahan not only adapted the Ken Bruen novel of the same name, but also made his directorial debut, and unfortunately, it wasn't exactly an auspicious one. The film stars Colin Farrell as Mitchell, an ex-con trying to go straight who is hired by a reclusive starlet to be her bodyguard; when they cross paths with a notorious mob boss, Mitchell is sucked back into the London underworld against his will. Unfortunately, while I felt the film was adequately stylish and chock full of meaty dialogue, I also felt that there were far too many subplots to follow and that the emphasis on style detracted from the film's overall quality. You'll probably only get a kick out of London Boulevard if you like the stars, or if you're looking for tips on how to speak Cockney.
B005Y9B5UG|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I really like Shakira, I have quite a few of her CDs and I have followed her since her major breakthrough album Piez Descalzos so if my review is not great it is not because I don't like her, but rather because I feel this concert does not showcase everything that she truly is.  It is evident that she has a lot of energy here and she gives it all for each song, but that exactly is my problem.  In almost every song she is jumping and running around, she literally does not stop moving the hips throughtout the concert.  This in itself is not a bad thing, except when it compromises the delivery of the songs.  Imagine running and jumping and trying to sing at the same time.  It is quite a feat, and my hat off to her for doing it, but in doing so, her vocals suffer quite bit.  My frustration with this concert is that she repeatedly does this for almost every song, she also does the freeze and unfreeze move way too much, till it becomes so repetitive that you just want to look away. I don't feel every song needs this much energy and effort, sometimes just her voice will do, sort of what like she did for the MTV Unplugged.  Yes, I know that was acustic, but the ideas remains the same, just her voice and the music. I would have liked to see more of blend of soft and hard, dancing and no dancing. This DVD is definetively not my favorite of her. Nevertheless, Shakira is a great artist and humanitarian.
B00637HXNG|5.0|I had the pleasure to do a meet n greet with the boys in July2010 in Atlanta and Tampa. This blu-ray is a must have . I was right back there and ît was almost as good as my front row seats. This blu-ray is the best as it gets. The show is fantastic and the boys are as tight as ever.As for their Swan Song......THIS IS THE BEST. Buy this and you will be glad you did.  UPDATE: The Scorpions are coming back to the US for a final tour this summer.
0385534639|5.0|A mysterious circus travels the world and arrives in various locations without warning. This magical, unique circus with several black and white tents filled with wondrous sights and experiences is only open from dusk 'til dawn.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to the circus patrons, two illusionists, Celia and Marco, are embroiled in a fierce competition and the circus is the battleground. As the circus continues to travel, Celia and Marco come up with more and more magical feats, trying to top each other. They have both been trained for this contest since childhood but neither one realizes how high the stakes actually are. The stakes become even higher when they fall in love with each other.<br /><br />The Night Circus was filled with lush descriptions and beautiful prose. Morgenstern does a wonderful job of creating a magical, fantastical world that has an eerie darkness to it as well. The novel weaves back and forth through time - I had a little trouble following the timeline at first. Luckily, each chapter begins with a heading with the date and it didn't take me long to get the story straight. I loved the world of The Night Circus and I felt like I was a part of that world while reading it. I was delighted to learn that Summit Entertainment has bought the film rights - this book will make a great movie.<br /><br />The Night Circus was Morgenstern's first novel - I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

B004P4S4NM|5.0|No painstakingly produced flashy stage show could ever take the place of what really matters when listening to music: Talent.<br /><br />Adele has more talent in the twinkle of her eye than the likes of Nicky Minaj, Sleigh Bells and Rihanna put together on top of a Celine Dion cake. The additional selling point that puts me over the top with her is that she doesn't have to be anything but Adele. Play music, hear her sing, feel her breathe. Done.<br /><br />Don't know if she can ever match the haunting beauty and production of 21 but I'm definitely gonna stay the course with her and figure it out.<br /><br />Thank you, Adele... at least I know quality hasn't been totally lost to hype.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|don't really care for mahjong, but this one is fun. great game. the advertisements as listed on the title page and if you don't like them don't click on them. great game.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These wonderful utensils are durable. They are useful - and not just because they are elevated. They are the perfect size for most of my pots/pans. I highly recommend these for any cook!  The one tiny negative (nothing is perfect, right?) - on the spatula with holes (green handle) - it can, at times, be hard to clean the holes. Just have to be patient and clean it.

0545425115|5.0|Wow.. What can I possibly say about this book that has not been said already? This one is an emotional rollercoaster that you will not want to get off of. No matter how painful the ride may be at times..<br /><br />I cried (really really hard) yelled out loud, screamed, cried some more, and completely, totally fell in love.. I tried to savor this one. Honestly I did, but the fact that I knew I had the second book to just run out and buy, kept me from savoring. Not to mention the fact that the story is just awesome. It sucks you in and holds you there.<br /><br />This society, is a piece of work. It sickens me how warped they really are. And what these, essentially children, are expected to do.. They must act upon, confront, & anticipate things that you wouldn't even expect your most seasoned adult to endure.. I love this book. Going to get the second one as soon as I post this. I highly recommend this read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liker this game Cu's It give me a boner and gets me delly hornet and I like it so much
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works great. It it extremely light, but provides great protection. the stand works very well. Overall very pleased.It performs as described.
B001FB5634|4.0|This is a story about survival of a father and son after an apocalyptic end to most of the life on the earth. The Old Man (Robert Duvall) is trying to find food, shelter, and safety for his young son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). This is a dangerous and terrifying journey that requires fighting off thieves, murderers, and wandering groups of cannibals on almost a daily basis. They can almost never relax and they must always be on guard for their lives.<br /><br />This is a great story but the movie is not as good (for me) as listening to or reading the book. The storyline is almost identical but since the world is virtually destroyed the movie is all grey and dreary. I know that it is required to make the point that this is a major catastrophic event but it just seems so depressing that it seems to steal some of the storyline in the movie.<br /><br />The acting is excellent and you can really sense the father's love for his son. This is one of the cases where the storyline is identical to the book but the book to me was much better. It is so descriptive that while reading it you felt as if you were there with them.<br /><br />I still liked the movie and gave it 4 stars. Had I not read the book first I might have given it 5 stars!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Great rendition of Emma.  Romola Garai captures Emma's well-intentioned yet meddling ways.  And Jonny Lee Miller makes for a great Mr. Knightly.  This is the best \\"Emma\\" I have ever seen.  Highly recommend this for any Jane Austen fan.
B004UHSB5A|2.0|I played several games and the game play was OK at best.  I did have a lot of trouble placing dominoes into play on the board even though they were legal plays.  It just seemed to move slowly after trying to place the same tile multiple times.<br /><br />Based on my experience with the game I will not keep it on my Kindle Fire. It was not that enjoyable to play and the little glitches just slowed it down too much.
B006B9REH6|4.0|I thought the bluray video quality was quite good.  The sound quality, although adequate, was limited to Dolby 5.1.  For a new release, that doesn't measure up.  No DTS, no DTS-HD.  The performance is good, but I found her to be especially \\"chatty\\" between songs.  I guess that's her style, but I thought it messed with the concert flow.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits well on the Baby Jogger.  Tilts a little forward but not enough for stuff to fall out.  folds flat with the strolled
B004UHSB5A|5.0|I am using the kindle fire. The game works well, I have had no issues with graphics, scrolling, etc. Had to read the instructions to learn to play. It is a strategy game so you have to think a step ahead. I would recommend it especially since its free today.
1466401885|5.0|I am sucker for love. Everyone who know me knows that. So when a friend of my recommended this book I couldn't resist and bought it. It's books like that this that make me wonder why in the world is she not freaking published! If she was this book would be flying off the walls! This book is awesome sauce! The whole nine yards! The whole enchilada! And if I could, I read it over and over again I would. Oh wait...I already did that!<br /><br />So what made me fall in love in this story. The plot. Hands down the plot. The plot is simple. Cute bad boy. Good girl running away from her past. Mix together and BAM! Let me tell you that I could not stop smiling and laughing so much. Even my hubby got a little jealous at the fact of me smiling like a teenage girl on the couch! The plot is awesome. I loved that is filling to the reader with every page turn. There's no boredom, no confusement, just pure entertainment till the very last page.<br /><br />The characters of this book totally rocked my world. I love Travis. His smile, his smart remarks, his corky smirk that makes me what to grab his face and kiss him! Travis is sooo him! I love that Ms. McGuire gave such a great insight to Travis that the reader feels as if you know him. It's like you've been friends for a long time. And Abby. I love this girls as well. She strong, level-headed and knows where she is going. She doesn't play games, but tells the truth like it is. She reminds me of well...me. :)<br /><br />The love interest in this book is great. I loved reading the up and downs of Travis and Abby. Cause like them no relationship is perfect. To see them conquer their past together, to grow and rely on each other is so lovely!<br /><br />A Beautiful Disaster achieves an engrossing and entertaining love that everyone will fall for. A rich, powerful story of love and friendship, A Beautiful Disaster excels in everything I hope for. Courage, strength, and a love that is so rare to find.<br /><br />*drinking/cursing/sex*
B0071T5PN0|1.0|Music isn't too terrible but Dave can't sing. I prefer my VH with Sammy and good. The vocals are terrible and the background is just Dave auto-tuned.. Need Michael to make the vocals work, but even that wouldn't save this crap.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think. that. the game can be fun you can delete. the other apps then just play this game that has a lot more in one whole game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The developers have thought of everything.  I really like that I can play it in portrait and landscape.  I've also customized my playing deck picture.

B004UHSB5A|1.0|The dominoes are way too small...  For the price that they supposedly get people to pay, it is a ridiculous rip off!!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I really like this cover.  It was so easy to install, and adds no noticeable weight at all.  The elastic strap gives me something to hold onto, so I have the feeling of more control.
B0036OS3MY|4.0|Very comfortable, warm winter boots.  Very lightweight, which is hard to find in a winter boot.  The height is just right.  Loved the color choices!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|For a long while I had been wanting to get this version of Superman II.  I have the Richard Lester one and while that one is cool I have to say the Donner Cut was way better.  I was really impressed with it and it was totally worth it.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Interesting at first, by the time I heard #4 Darkness I was sucked in completely...could not stop smiling. #5 was so silky and smooth I was glad to never have known him. #7 Banjo is fun, light and dark all at once.  Excellent!
B000IJ79UW|5.0|For a long time this was the version I had wanted to get.  The special features in it were incredible and the first thing I watched.  I was lucky enough that the packaging got messed up in the sense that there were two copies of disk #3.  Definately a must for any Superman fan!
B0052U59F4|5.0|what a read! I could not put this book down. I'm usually not into the S&M stories, but the characters in this book were so well written, that I kept reading just to find out what would happen next. The second book in the series is even better than the first and I'm currently reading the third. I can't believe that this is the first book E.L James has written. It is so well done!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried a bunch of different keyboards for the DROID X, and SwiftKey X is by far my favorite. The prediction engine and learning engine are surprisingly good, and the interface is clean and straightforward. This keyboard has made my text entries faster and more accurate in all apps, and it's easy to use with one hand or two. It's also nice that it offers discrete language packs that can be toggled on and off, and be used individually or in combinations. The language packs really do help the prediction engine, and frequent -- but not too frequent -- updates keep the language packs current. Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked at the beginning! Couldn't put it down... however, the ending (literally the last three pages) was kind of ... slow, for lack of a better word.  I am excited to read the second installment in the trilogy!
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is very addicting, with its many goals and variety of nuts. the graphics are awesome its like your actually flying
1400106338|5.0|I have the story mostly memorized from reading the book and watching the movies, and the narrator does a good job of changing up the voices and carrying the emotion of the story. It did take a little while to get used to her voice, but I am enjoying the tale. You can never go wrong with Jane Austen. She is funny, witty and has a keen eye into human nature. Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun so many variets. interesting, funny, great, amazing, this game is my go to all the time because its so fun
0470449748|5.0|I have several of these GMAT books and I think this one so far has been the most helpful. The CD is also very useful. Although it can be expensive, I recommend sitting for the test a time or two to get comfortable. Treat them as practice runs. Even though I timed myself using the CDs, I could not help but giving myself a bit of extra time. Then of course I am more nervous at home than in the test center!  So far I have used Kaplan (math was not representative of real GMAT math), Dummies (too much of an overview, you WILL need backup!), Princeton Review (again, math not so thorough)-- this one (Official Guide) is probably the best of them all. Good luck!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you say its horrible you are NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT human at all. And you are CRAZY and coco in your caybasa.
B006ON41FC|5.0|It's my favorite game on my kindle fire! Addicting, awesome graphics, cute squirrel, and nice to pass by extra time!I don't normally rate games, and this is why I said &quot;but&quot; in my title. Ever time I come in it asks me to rate it over and over and over. I wish they would stop that. It annoyed and interrupted my game so much that now I am here. I do highly recommend it though!
B00008WJBU|5.0|This is quite an original movie in terms of concept. The idea that luck can be controlled, taken away and applied as a competitive sporting activity is quite brilliant when you think of it. Its actually pretty believable when you see people in the news winning lotteries multiple times. Good movie considering its on Netflix.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is fun and challenging. always having a great time and children have an excellent time trying to collect nuts and get a higher level in the levels of nuts and of course achievements.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game it is great for kids and adults I. must warn you though you can get very addicted to this game I would absolutely. give this game ALL 5 STARS!!! :P
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Great true story.  Refreshing to watch a movie about a real life story that is ordinary but exceptional.  Someone who most of us would never have  heard about except through this movie.  Brad Pitt plays the role well.  Loved Jonah Hill playing opposite to Brad Pitt, great combination and hilarious at times.  Brad Pitts usual laid back kinda movie  that when said and done is always enjoyable.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Loved the Vegas show but it does not compare to this one on blu ray.  Excellent vocals, acting, costumes, etc.  Never have a show that moved me to tears like this one.  I love every minute of it.  The only thing I wish they would add was the falling of the chandelier like in Vegas.  That would top it off an already excellent show.  Oh, and what a treat at the end.  I didn't expect it all.  I'm glad I caught it.  I highly recommend this to people who cannot see this production live.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely adored this book.  Being the owner of four Labs, it makes me look at them differently, but it is impossible to describe why unless you sit down and read the book.  The author sneaks in a lot of \\"life lessons\\" along the way....I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to everyone!
B000059MEK|2.0|Got this after hearing and really enjoying Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.  Few if any of the other tracks have the richness of that one.  For many of them, you have essentially heard the entire track after the  first 8 beats, or even after the first 4!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I was so enthralled by this presentation!  I found it to be far superior to The Sopranos!  Each character's story line is consistant as the story progresses, building the suspense and entertainment.  Even the Bad Guys are great.  I am awaiting Season 2 from Amazon's library of Good Deals!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|When I first heard about the book on twitter, i knew there itself that it will be a good read, and when i got a copy of the book, i was delighted.  And then when i started reading the book, i was so hooked and could not keep it down, it was an amazing read, the book is like a blend of paranormal, fairy-tale, symbolism, etc and its hard to come across that has all these in the same. It also gives light to those who misunderstand the Wiccan faith, c'mon it's certainly not evil. Every character felt so real.. i was drawn to an entirely new world. and how each creature is linked to an element.. its amazing ! i would definitely recommend the book to anyone who think its their type. Becca is one of the new writers in town you should look out for.Am looking forward to the series that follows.. :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|My best friend put me on to this series and  boy am I glad i listened to her! This story is so refreshing. Its original and touching, sad, and so hard core! Over all, this is an awesome read!!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|First, a word about the auto-tuning.  I will say that I am generally averse to electric manipulation of the voice.  The difference here is that Fun. uses auto-tuning, not to compensate for the soloist's inability to sing (as a disturbingly increasing number of popular artists do these days -- as we have seen in his live performances Nate Ruess can really belt one out).  Fun. uses auto-tune as a completely valid musical instrument; it's done tastefully and appropriately, not to compensate for some vocal shortcoming.  Sans auto-tune, Nate Ruess is a strong high tenor who sings without vibrato, making his high notes in \\"We Are Young\\" sound pretty effortless.<br /><br />The record is one where you don't find yourself skipping over tracks.  Each is packed with a catchy melody.  There is not one weak link in the record, with the exception being \\"It Gets Better\\" (track 5), but even this is not a bad song at all.<br /><br />For many, \\"We Are Young,\\" with its massive, anthemic chorus used in a Chevy commercial and episode of Fox's Glee, is the track that exposed them to Fun.  For the rest of us that have been with Nate since his days in The Format, this record is the sophomore record with Fun., following the phenomenal \\"Aim and Ignite.\\"  There is no \\"sophomore slump\\" here where a good indie band becomes a bit more popular and a bit more commercialized.  Rather Fun. has partly moved away from the sound of \\"Aim and Ignite\\" developed their own sound out of an effective blending of different styles and genres:<br /><br />At some instances (\\"Intro\\" and \\"Some Nights\\") Nate Ruess seems to summon Queen.  The chorus \\"Why Am I the One\\" is tinged with early Elton John.  Select bars in \\"All Alone\\" echo of early Maroon5, while a heavy bass and short, simple ostinato in \\"One Foot\\" are quite obviously Ruess's use of hip-hop elements.  This track is a standout, showcasing Fun.'s songwriting ability -- a melody that builds in intensity over a simple repetition of a simple 1-1-4-5 chord progression.  The track \\"Stars\\" starts out as a run-of-the-mill alternative rock piece, then without transition, changes character into an extended R&B influenced segment with effective (not compensatory) use of auto-tune cradled by classically-inspired strings.  It blends these influences together into something original-sounding, while somehow retaining its indie roots.  Each song is in a key signature that is closely related the previous song, making the entire album fit together as one whole, well-crafted structure.  Musicians will be thrilled at this.<br /><br />Musically, the songs are filled with masterful instrumentations and compositional techniques that keep the listening experience interesting.  For example, stark tempo changes, as in \\"We Are Young,\\" and modulations to minor key as in the end of \\"One Foot\\" aren't just clever insertions.  Rather, they compliment the already memorable melodies.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books of this series were great. I ate them up in a weekend.  The third book on the other hand really disappointed me. With everything that Katniss has been through you would hope the author would allow her character to grow and become strong, - instead she is still insecure, taken advantage of and constantly throws Peeta and Gale to the wolves. She worries about them but yet seems to shrug her shoulders knowing it will all work out. The pattern occurs throughout the entire series. I eventually saw through her character and realized she is deeply flawed and has little growth throughout all 3 novels - I began to hate her and it ruined this book for me.  I know this is fiction meant for young adults so they won't care or pick up on this - and that's great. It is good, fast writing and highly entertaining. It is at least getting kids who sit i nfront of an Xbox or TV to sit down and read. That I can admire.  I am only an average reader as far as number of books I read a year, but after going from Stephen King's 11/22/67 to the Hunger Games series it is blatantly apparent Suzanne Collins is not an author in the upper echelon of literary genius.
1401223176|5.0|This comic re-kindled my \\"Batman is awesome\\" days.<br />I read many comics growing up and have lately been picking up ones i missed yesteryear. With this array of characters I felt like i was a kid again watching the animated series after school, except the story given here blows any i've seen before out of the water!
B0036OS3N8|5.0|I am a lady with bad feet and arthritis and so putting on boots and boots with laces etc was very difficult.  I have gone without boots for years and so the daily dog walk always meant cold wet shoes.  These boots are not only weatherproof and warm, but they are so very comfortable and easy on and off.  Great in the winter for cold ice and snow and I know the spring/summer/fall puddles will be no problem either.  I LOVE them and would reccommend them to anyone. Got the same size as the size I take in shoes and they are just a bit large, but for me that's perfect.  Great value and a great product!!!!

B0062NAVXA|5.0|Great movie.  Made me want to do better as a father.  This movie showed life is short and family is very important next to God.  This movie is a must for fathers.  More fathers need to spend time with their families.  The family is so important to God and America.

B005FMZWD8|2.0|First, I have to give Amazon an F- for delivery. Item took two weeks to arrive with USPS not even attempting to deliver the parcel to my door for signature even though I was home. Instead, slip was left in my mailbox stating I must collect it at postal substation 3miles away, which was closed that day, being a Saturday.  Second, this is a very large watch, over 46mm diameter and ~14mm thick, bigger in hand than appears in the picture. If you're not used to wearing an oversized, chunky watch its a bit overbearing, imho.  In fairness, the finish and quality were ok, just too flashy for my tastes.  All said, had to return the watch
1400069289|5.0|I got this book thinking it was a self-help type for those wanting to break bad habits but that was not the case; turns out it was much better and more fascinating! This book actually explains the mechanics of how habits are created and why they are so ingrained into our systems. For example, a man who lost all working memory in an accident still retained his habit of taking walks in his neighborhood. It explicitly shows how habits are formed at a more basic and primal area of our brain which makes it so difficult to modify. Difficult, but not impossible. There isn't a program that's outlined or definite steps that one must take, but it does give you enough knowledge that you could work out your own system for modifying a specific habit you no longer want to have.<br /><br />The most fascinating part, to me, was when the author talked about habits of corporations and hospitals. It gave you a sneak peek at the inner workings of some of them which (in the case of Target) was amusing or at turns (in the case of the hospital) a little alarming.<br /><br />Well researched and well written, I enjoyed it and have already recommended it to several of my friends (making sure to stress it was not a hint they had a habit that needed changing.)

B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has really out done herself with this book. My fiancé thought I had gone mad by the way I was furiously giggling at this book. Her use of new age technology to make a new love story was refreshing and I can honestly say she had me guessing right up until the end. Very good read.
0374275637|3.0|I'm only a third of the way through, but I don't think I've read a book this ponderous.  I mean that in a good and bad way. It reads like a social science textbook.  I have to re-read passages, and sometimes that produces an Aha!  Most of the time, however, I'm left with the feeling I used to have when reading college texts:  I hope this isn't on the test.  It's not a page-burner, but it occasionally sheds insight on the unconscious (fast-thinking) and conscious (slow-thinking) sides of our brain. I'm hoping the author will tell me eventually what I'm supposed to do with this information.

B00001OH7O|5.0|This album is amazing from start to finish every song is great. I love the piano playing on this album and david bowies voice is amazing and unique. I love the whole album but I have to sday Life On Mars is subperb the song is so beautiful. This is a must have but a little bit more mellow than his other albums also Mick Ronsons guitar isnt heard as much on this album. Its more Rick Wakemans piano that stands out which is absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061906220|5.0|Just bought this last week for my 3 1/2 year old grandson and downloaded the song from the harper collins website. to say that he loved it is putting it mildly. i couldnt get him to put the book down or stop asking me to replay it. he must have listened to it 20 times from saturday night to sunday morning. he does not sit still for very long but this book and song definitely held his interest. it is a great story and song. i highly recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|ive always been a fan of making and this game I really like. I got it for when it was free and there aren't much ads. when u start the game there's a big blue button that says play now. don't know where all these other people are saying ads all over the place. u are rating the game, not ads. this is an excellent game!!!!

B0017I0KVI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Jane Austen and I think Amanda Grange does a great job of staying true to Austen's style. It's fantastic to get 'the other side of the story' with her series of Diaries. She doesn't try to add nor take away from the flavor of the original novels. I have read Mr Knightley's Diary, Colonel Brandon's Diary, and Mr Darcy's Diary and I highly recommend all of them. I am just waiting for her to write Mr Rochester's Diary!

B004UHSB5A|1.0|This game is horrible! But also, maybe I could suggest a new whack faotd that people could use. It's called an alarm clock. For all of these folks writing reviews saying they wait up till 3:15 just to see the faotd. Go to bed and set an alarm for 3a.m.  We dont feel bad that you stayed up for nothing. These people would complain about a free lunch. The game itself really is horrible though. No creativity.

B000YENUI6|5.0|2007's \\"Eastern Promises\\" is Director David Cronenberg's mesmerising look at the Russian Mafia, an unflinching look at an unlovely bunch.  A first rate cast and a well-chosen London setting combine for a movie you can't take your eyes off of.<br /><br />When a 14 years old girl dies in childbirth in a London hospital, British-Russian mid-wife Anna (Naomi Watts) seeks out her family.  A card in the dead girl's diary leds her to the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, run by Semyon (a subtle Armin Mueller-Stahl), who just happens to be the local head of the Russian Mafia.  Anna's knowledge of the contents of the diary will place her and the new-born baby at risk.<br /><br />At the center of the story is Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), driver for Semyon and his drunkard son Kirill (Vincent Cassel).  Nikolai exudes a quiet, menacing charm, and a sense of purpose somewhat at odds with his junior status.  His additional duty as fixer of Semyon's problems brings him back into contact with Anna, the beginnings of a fragile relationship.  As betrayals pile up bodies and the lives of Anna and the baby hang in the balance, Nikolai will prove to be more than he seems.<br /><br />Mortensen is superb as Nikolai, the tattoed and ruthless career thief with a conscience.  A twisting and rapidly paced plot will bring the audience to a surprising conclusion.  \\"Eastern Promises\\" is a violent movie but highly recommended as well-made and atmospheric entertainment.

B005B19UPE|5.0|SARAH'S KEY<br /><br />What a fool I have been my entire life not realizing that other countries rounded up Jews and eliminated them or put them through pure hell.  I had never heard of the horrors suffered by the French Jewish people when they were taken like cattle in July, 1942 and sent to their deaths.  This was known as Vel' d'Hiv' and took place in Nazi occupied France.  Fear is a horrible disease.<br /><br />Sarah and her family, like thousands of others, fall victim to this unbelievable and horrific disaster. Sarah and her family are rousted out of their home, but before they are forced to leave, Sarah stashes her little baby brother in their favorite and very secret hiding place, a bedroom cupboard.  She promises the wee one she will return to save him -- ---  she promises.<br /><br />History and fiction marry well into this fantastic reading experience.  We follow Sarah through her monstrous adventures -- being removed from her home, sent to a holding place in France, put on a train, sent to a camp, separated from her parents, her ultimate future out of the camp.  Thousands disappear off the face of the Earth.  NEVER. TO. BE. SEEN. AGAIN.  NEVER.<br /><br />Jump forward approximately sixty years in the future where we meet Julia Jarmond, an American who is married and living in France.  She is a journalist working on a small article for her paper and through her investigation she 'finds' Sarah.  Julia becomes obsessed with the Sarah story, and realizes there are links and coincidences between Sarah's past and her husband's family.<br /><br />Tatiana de Rosnay writes a beautiful story; one that will break your heart and outrage you.  Relive some of the darkest times in world history as seen through little Sarah's eyes.  The grim and dreadful past is dredged up through the voice of a young and brave little girl and again in the present by Julia Jarmond.<br /><br />This book was one of the best and different I have read regarding the Holocaust and the French involvement.  I loved the entire book; however, the ending seemed a tad predictable to this reader.  That being said, this book is a solid high five rating and is one I will never forget.  The sections of the book set during the Holocaust were wonderfully written and the entire book was woven into a beautiful tapestry. I feel it was also a tribute to the millions who were so brutally lost during this period.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pameemed a tad predictable to this reader.

B004W1GD4A|4.0|I admit I was not familiar with the original Upstairs, Downstairs show from the 1970s until very recently. I love the interesting plot lines, the great cast, and the quality of writing. However, the production values are predictably dated and the film quality leaves much to be desired with the effect of looking washed out with dull colors. I hope they will restore the show one of these days and come up with a better quality DVD, with crisp and clear images and sound.<br /><br />When I saw that there was a remake of Upstairs, Downstairs, I was excited especially since I was feeling withdrawal symptoms with the end of Season 2 of Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2, one of my favorite British period dramas. One of the drawbacks of this remake is the fact that Season One only has three episodes! Initially, I thought this must be due to unfavorable audience response, and that the show was not renewed, but to my delight, it has been renewed for another season with six episodes. I still feel it is not enough, but I'll take what I can get!<br /><br />The setting for this remake of Upstairs, Downstairs is 1936, about six years after the year in which the original series had ended (in film). 165 Eaton Place is literally resurrected, not by a member of the Bellamy clan (the original family that resided there) but by the Holland's, made up of Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) who works for the Foreign Office, and his wife, Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes). They are soon joined by Hallam's eccentric mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins) and Agnes' spoilt younger sister Lady Persie (Claire Foy). Maud pushes her way into the household, bringing along her secretary/manservant Amanjit (Art Malik with a ghastly beard) and her little pet monkey Samson.<br /><br />The staff downstairs are made up of housekeeper, Mrs. Rose Buck (Jean Marsh - yes, from the original Upstairs, Downstairs, where she played a parlour maid); butler Mr. Warrick Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough); chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson); cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street - Golden Anniversary Collection [DVD](REGION 2, UK VERSION); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank. There's also a young footman who appears, goes away, and returns during the first season.<br /><br />The main events in this first season revolve around Lady Agnes trying to take charge of her household, and coming up against her formidable mother-in-law who uses her vast experience as a weapon to override her daughter-in-law's wishes. Not that Lady Agnes tries too hard, given a new development that preoccupies her. Meanwhile, a new maid is brought into the fold, and it turns out she is a Jewess who has escaped from Germany. She appears sickly and harbors a secret that is revealed soon enough.<br /><br />Lady Persie is portrayed as the self-centered, lost soul-type whose reckless nature causes her to not only throw convention to the wind, but also strike up a most inappropriate alliance. She also develops an interest in right-wing activities involving the fascist movement in Britain, a thread that was unfortunately rushed through during the course of the three episodes. Another thread explored this season was the relationship between Wallis Simpson with Edward VIII and the abdication crisis.<br /><br />I liked this first season, but would have liked to see more time spent on developing the main characters. It all seemed a bit rushed, as if the writers and producers were trying to cram as much as they could into the three episodes. I hope to see more time being spent on plot and character development next season. Note: The streaming quality here was excellent.cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street - Golden Anniversary Collection [DVD](REGION 2, UK VERSION); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank.

B004UAKAE2|5.0|I am sorry to admit that I have only recently discovered this series, and that too by way of the remake, which is available via streaming as well. I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).<br /><br />This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series [[ASIN:B004KAQQ5E Downton Abbey: Episode 1]] and others. Some of the episodes in season one are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.<br /><br />The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during this season is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, and the plight of the poor, among others.<br /><br />The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy, the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Southwold (played by Rachel Gurney) , and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) who through the course of the first season, demonstrates socialist tendencies and spurns the life she was born to.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); housemaid Sarah Moffatt (Pauline Collins) whose impetuous nature not only lands her in trouble but disrupts the lives of those around her; and many more.<br /><br />Each episode has an interesting plot hook that keeps the viewer interested and eager to learn what happens next. One of my favorite episodes this season was the one where apparently steadfast Lady Marjorie succumbs to the charms of a younger man, and falls head over heels in love! It was an engaging episode because it showed that despite their stiff upper lips, some of these upper class people had strengths and failings like others, and it was also a romantic and poignant episode.<br /><br />Having finished Season One, I now look forward to Season Two!ns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); housemaid Sarah Moffatt (Pauline Collins) whose impetuous nature not only lands her in trouble but disrupts the lives of those around her; and many more.

B005D7ECMM|5.0|I got Lawrence Of Arabia because I heard people say it was an exceptional legendary movie and that it had wonderful music in it. I did not know that Lawrence Of Arabia was a real person before I heard the people on the DVD say so, and according to them there was the usual contempt and bashing for historical inaccuracies that always happens whenever anyone does a fictionalized dramatized story inspired by the existence of real persons. Steven Speilberg appears on the DVD saying that it's all right to do that with obscure history that most people don't know about but if you're dealing with well-known history that's taught every day in school, then it's not all right to put inaccuracies in it. I don't agree with that judgemental statement and I really don't understand why people make such a big judgemental deal about historical inaccuracy. As long as a movie is not professing to be a depiction of the truth, then the moviemakers have a right to tell the story however they want, if they think some fiction will make it more interesting than the real events. Most people know that even when a movie is \\"based on a true story\\" there will always be some details that are fictionalized. Just don't ever watch a movie assuming that everything in it really happened and then you'll be all right. I actually think that inaccuracies in movies can inspire viewers to do research and learn more about the real events. That's the point--if you wanna know what really happenned with some historical characters, find out from other sources besides movies made about them. Now, if a history book was written and was claiming to be the truth and contained a bunch of glaring inaccuracies, then I would understand people getting upset about that, cuz a history book is SUPPOSSED to be an education about the truth and if a history book is not true then it is fooling people. But to me, if someone insults and bashes a movie for nothing but historical inaccuracy, that just means it's a bitter person alwayslooking for things to get mad about and it means they didn't like the movie anyway and they use the historical inaccuracy as an excuse to justify their hatred of the movie. I get very tired of hearing criticisms about inaccuracy and hearing people call movies awful and worthless just because they're inaccurate. So, as for the DVD, I found it educational to listen to the people talk on the DVD (educational about how humans view things and how humans think, I mean) and the movie itself is an intriguing story about a man trying to find out who he is and what his place is in the world, shifting his loyalty back and forth between the Arabians and the English military, and I believe there are real people that go through that kind of identity crisis, and I believe any movie about someone who tries to help make a difference in a bunch of oppressed people's lives is valuable, regardless of what is inaccurate about it. There is always constantly something happening in the story and so every scene is informational to the plot and every scene matters despite how long the movie is. They said this DVD was an extended director's cut version with a bunch of scenes that were not in the theatrical release, and I cannot imagine the movie without any of the scenes that are here. If David Lean considers this his best movie, he has good reason to think so because the movie deals with so many human interest issues. Peter O'Toole gives a sympathetic performance and it is easy to see why this movie made him a star. There's too much that goes on in the movie for me to have time to really comment on the plot, but this is a moving drama about respecting people of other civilizations and I think it has a message that can extend to other issues besides the Arabians. This is a very worthwhile movie and anyone who cares about people should see it. It has no shortage of entertainment either.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Currently the best show on tv IMO. Looks fantastic on bluray and a show about drugs really should be seen uncensored as it is in this form. This show manages to get better with every season. I cannot wait to purchase season 4 when it finally comes out!

0061537969|3.0|I thought the choice to make the narrative voice that of the dog was interesting. It limited perspective in some ways, but it made you think about things a little harder. Ultimately, though, I found it annoying that the dog was not really fish nor fowl. He was a dog who was aspiring to be a person, and to understand things, but either he didn't understand things that I wanted to know about (like how the main couple worked), or he read a lot of internal motivation into something that seemed like it should be opaque to dogs, like courtroom proceedings.<br /><br />The arc of the book was very straightforward. Hero has everything going for him, hero encounters terrible times but refuses to give up, hero is rewarded in the end for his perseverance. Hopefully that is not too much of a spoiler. The plot is not the interesting part of this book to me, but the people are. I liked the description of a lawyer as being shaped like a B, and being full of B words, like brash and bold and blustery.<br /><br />Perhaps I am spoiled by my other readings, but I found the emotional depth pretty flat. Although there are a lot of emotional events, they are filtered through a dog's perceptions.<br /><br />Read if: You are looking for something short and accessible to impress the book club with. You are jonesing for books with unusual narrators. You like reading snippets of car racing without any actual depth.<br /><br />Skip if: You have high expectations about emotional resonance. You don't want to read about custody cases or death. You are my sister. The zen of racecars will leave you unmoved.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie can change your marriage. It saved mine when I thought nothing could. The acting with all of the ones made by this church are naturally not award-winning performances, but you don't even notice or care. The message is so powerful that it comes through like a hurricane. Thank goodness someone is making movies like these, which are obviously done with a true calling and purpose.....to help people. I bought all 3 movies they have made thus far and I will post the same comment as to each. They are great. Don't stop at just 1. Buy all 3 and loan them to friends and family who need to hear the message of God. I wish that we would see movies with this type of message in theaters with award-winning actors willing to sacrifice the million-dollar paychecks to share God's Word. Not because I long to see better performances, but because more people would be drawn to church if headliners would act in them. As for me and my family, I just hope this church continues to make movies with such a powerful message. I will buy them ALL~!

0891419063|5.0|World War 2 is probably the most recited, documented, re-created (film), and discussed war in the history of this planet.  Yet I have to say that not all WWII stories can match the genuine, touching, and brutally honest rendition as Eugene Sledge has captured here.  As a Private with the Marines during the Pacific invasion, Sledge has put together a truly masterful book.  It took him over 40 years to get the nerve to finally write down the horrors of his experience.  But I promise, if you are a WWII enthusiast that craves first-person encounters from real front-line men (not officers or war writers), start off with this one by E.B. Sledge because you will thoroughly enjoy it.  It is eye-opening and captivating.

B00447G2PM|5.0|I'm fairly new to the 3D Blu-ray world, so I'm just starting to see the difference between cheaply-made 3D movies and high-quality 3D movies.  I have to say, IMAX Deep Sea looked very very good.  The 3D aspect adds to much depth to the screen.  There was a good amount of images that \\"come out of the screen\\", but not an overwhelming amount.  The \\"story\\" itself is good as they cover a wide variety of deep sea animals.  Narrated by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, they give the documentary a soothing, professional feel.  I haven't watch any of the other IMAX 3D Blu-rays, but I must say, this one was stunning for the price and quality.  I say go for it.

When Joey came back and the put out Worship Music, all I could say was MY BAND ANTHRAX IS BACK IN BUSINESS AGAIN!! I LOVE THIS CD. IT'S hard strong rough and totally Anthrax. I thought they went into new territory with John Bush. ( ALTHOUGH I DO LOVE HIS VOCALS AND ALWAYS LOVE ARMORED SAINT)This album has that heavy thrash sound and feel that we love so much. Judas Priest,Im Alive, The Devil You know are some of my FAVORITE SONGS. Joey's voice is pitch perfect!!!!.

B000FBJHZS|3.0|This is the 4th book I've read by Dan Brown and it was an enjoyable read but was not my favorite. Some parts of the book were very predictable, such as during the press conference by Senator Sexton to expose the conspiracy he was distracted by his daughter Rachel while the evidence in white envelopes where swapped out. The main antagonist however was a surprise to me so that prevented this book from being a failure. Overall this was an enjoyable book to read but in my opinion, Angels and Demons is still Dan Brown's best work as of to date.<br /><br />3.5/5 stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love it! Awesome and cute game. Great time killer. Easy controls and fun to play. And need to add more words apparently.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Put this in on a Biostar Mobo running AMD Athlon II x3 CPU. Its whisper silent so I love it. I don't overclock much, but my wife plays these annoying Facbook games (farm-ville, city-ville,....etc) and they caused the fan to hit 100% RPM which I could here from the room next door to where I had the PC.  Machine now runs cooler and silent even under load of the flash games.  My only cons are:  1- The unit is about 2.5 times taller than the stock fan that came with the AMD CPU. So it is Huge  2- It will require you remove the whole Mobo to install this fan. It needs to have a backplate attached on the back of the mobo, then the fan attaches to that backplate. So expect about 25-30 mins for install.  Other than that, great unit
B004UHSB5A|3.0|The app is so so.  Definitely could be a lot better.  Some color maybe.  Different background options and colored tiles would be nice.  I'd give it 2.5 stars, but rounded it up to 3 to offset the lame pizza reviews.  So many wannabe superman75 reviewers.  Sorry, but there can only be one superman!  You guys don't come close!
B004UHSB5A|3.0|The intelligence of the game is very good. The computer can make some strong plays, but the handling of the dominoes is very poor. It's very hard to select a piece, and once you do, it's also hard to put the piece where you want to place it. I like the game, but I don't like its interface.
0802136834|5.0|Many have already more aptly than I could review this wonderful book. I would only add that as a rare reader of non-fiction I found this fast paced and intriguing. I looked forward to every evening when it was time to crack open the pages and be taken away to Tudor England. I was rather please I'd say that Anne Boleyn was beheaded. She was after all awful to Katherine of Aragon and their daughter Mary. She deserved what she got! Also I would say Henry deserves some credit what it comes to ensuring the women around him were educated. Between him and Katherine Parr the women of his court enjoyed the benefits of almost limitless education.<br /><br />If I had any criticism it was Weir's propensity to let the reader know what would happen, before it happened and ruining the mystery and surprise at times. It was as though she assumed the reader already knew the events, when as in my case I didn't.

B006OFN0SE|5.0|I am not a real fan of lead character but done by Clint Eastwood, thus rather expected I would like. The lead is great, he gets better with each passing year and the entire cast I found the same. One you should have for a much clearer view of our past and often why it should not be repeated

B004IQMXD4|5.0|This is a great new CD from Stevie Nicks! The song titled \\"Midnight, A Vampire's Dream\\", reminds me of the old classic Stevie. You can really hear it in her voice in the beginning of the song. The whole CD is good, but it's worth buying for one song!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|It's something that occupies every American's mind at one time or another, if only for a few minutes: what would have happened had John Kennedy not been assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963? Could America's involvement in Vietnam have been avoided (for just one example)? It's a great premise for a novel and King handles it well. It's hard to talk about this book in detail without giving away crucial spoilers, but I'll do my best here.<br /><br />Turns out that there's a little Hole In Time sitting in the storage room of a diner in present day New England that's permanently wired to 1958. The diner's owner discovered it some time ago and after exploring the general properties of the Hole and what he can do with it, he broadens his horizons and starts working on altering the course of history in a truly significant way. Because of failing health, he enlists the aid of a much younger 30-something to finish the job of stopping Oswald, a task that he himself in his advanced age became to ill to complete. Our hero, Jake discovers that time is not as flexible as one might imagine and that it seems to resist change actively. Small deviations in the established timeline are easy, but altering people's lives is much harder. The more important the historical personnage, the harder and more dangerous it is to alter events.<br /><br />Jake's up against two things: a force in time that fights back when changed as well as having to find a way to get by for five years while waiting for 1963 to arrive. Not as easy as it sounds. One is bound to make personal connections and alterations over such a long span of time. Jake falls in love with a woman who forces him to make choices between his mission to stop Oswald and his devotion to her. This could have been very pat and predicable but I thought King did a great job of making the relationship feel real and complex.<br /><br />Tension is maintained well throughout the novel as it's never clear as to whether it's even possible to alter history in such a significant way. Will jake stop Oswald? CAN he stop Oswald? What will happen if he's successful? It's a long 800+ page journey to find out, but it didn't feel like an effort. The pacing is competent enough to sustain a story of this length. As for what happens when one tries to stop the assassination of a president, let's just say that nothing's predictable and King keeps you guessing the whole way. The suspense lasts right up to the last 50 pages of the book and it manages to contain surprises.<br /><br />I think this book owes a great debt to Jack Finney, author of \\"Time and Again,\\" a classic time travel novel that has much in common with 11/22/63. Clearly King was inspired by Finney as he appears in the acknowledgements at  the back of the book.cant way. Will jake stop Oswald? CAN he stop Oswald? What will happen if he's successful?

B0064MT1NU|4.0|I have loved The Piano since I saw it in the theater in 1993. For the longest time it has only been available on an old letterbox DVD. Finally, someone has seen fit to give the film its due on blu-ray and the results are wonderful. The image is just gorgeous with wonderful bold colors and oodles of texture and detail. If you think the grain and noise in many scenes are the result of a faulty transfer, then you are wrong, as they are the qualities of the original source. Meaning that it is supposed to be there, because that's the way it was shot! The cinematography was nominated for an Academy Award that year.<br /><br />The stereo sound mix has excellent clarity with dialogue and sound effects. It's a stereo mix, as it was when it was originally released, so don't expect some full immersion surround experience. It's a dialogue driven film anyway.<br /><br />As far as there not being subtitles, I know that they were originally part of the film, and they should be there, at least as an option, but my viewing experience was not lessened in any way by the lack of them. I can usually understand what people are saying just from their gestures and reactions, not specific words, but overall.<br /><br />I highly recommend the blu-ray of The Piano. It looks and sounds better than it ever has on video and is about as close to the theatrical experience as you're going to get.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game its really fun. I enjoy plying this on my kindle fire when I'm bored. I got this for free so it was worth it. it gives u different goals to finish and is just challenging enough. get it!!
0316017930|4.0|Look back at your many accomplishments, do you feel successful? Did all your hard work, sweat, and blood pay off? Were all those things that you accomplished, a success? What is success?  After reading Outliers, you will be amazed at how oblivious the meaning of the word `success' is to the mind of many. The word `success' no longer means what you always thought it meant. It does not pertain to money, nor business, or intelligence, and ambition, but rather, their culture, their family, and their generation. Who would have thought? Gladwell introduces many studies involving hockey players, plane pilots, math wizzes, lawyers, and young children. They all pertain to one thing, success. According to Gladwell, 10,000 hours is the key to success, but unfortunately not for all. It was opportunity, and chance that got those `successful' people where they are today.    Intertwined with the meaning of success, is an outlier. People whose achievements fall outside normal experiences. Does an outlier really exist?
1595827684|5.0|I finally got my book ordered and received it today (after Amazon oddly pulled them for a few days) and I am very satisfied with it. The book itself is what I would call slightly over sized and fairly hefty, over 3 pounds. I have already had a lot of fun flipping through the book, it's neat to see how beloved characters took shape over the development process (Jack...with hair!) and early designs of locations and characters that never made it into the world.<br /><br />The content runs from early sketches to full blown art work of the Mass Effect universe. Most have comments and explanations attached such as what the goal of that design was, why they removed this or that, very insightful to see inside the art design of a Bioware project.<br /><br />Be warned the book does contain artwork and images from Mass Effect 3, during my flipping I seen a few things I wish I hadn't... so if you don't want any spoilers you may want to wait until launch to browse it. Although it seems most of the ME3 content is towards the back of the book.<br /><br />On a small note, I did notice my book had some minor damage (slight bending) to the bottom corners, nothing serious but it's worth noting.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I have spent hundreds of hours playing the first two games and will probably spend much more on the final chapter of Shepard's saga. It's nice to know even years from now I can flip through this terrific book and remember the hours of fun I had.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|yea so I cant Vega enough of this game it is awesome.I.love it I adore it I play it every day and I love it
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I was hesitant about going with this garage because it is a little more expensive than some other ones, but after four or five months of a lot of play with it, I am very happy I did.  Very cute, well made parking garage that kids love.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|this game is fairly decent. it takes a bit of getting used to but its fun and if u like checkers u may enjoy learning how to play chess on this fun new app. it also saves ur game from your latest stopping point which is Super handy.
0307200477|5.0|This is such a sweet classic book, and the big size is so fun!  I glue gunned the comb ring binder together so the book pages don't fall apart.  This worked great.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it seems this game has lots of potential. I am a little sad about some of the lag time in the touch games. but it makes you be a critical. thinker.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great game.  my kids really love the game.  it makes them laugh every time.  enjoyable, and playable.  I would have payed if I had to, but I got lucky
B00729GQ0A|5.0|A very good and fascinating read I would say. And am so thankful to Becca for sending me a copy of the book. Once I started it, I never felt like putting it down.The book takes you to an entirely different world.And I really loved the way how each creature is linked to an element. The chapter 'Ivory's Memories' so beautifully written.I could feel the character's pain and won't deny shedding a few tears (yeah, yeah ! call me crazy).<br /><br />I feel like Sophia's mother is just a misunderstood character with lots of agony of her own, would have loved to read more about her father though.I liked the character Adrian, not much of the talking type,he is more like this loner you find in every group of friends who is not given much importance and taken as a weirdo, but then again he is also the storehouse of knowledge and all the so called `friends' go to him in need for advice or help... and he is more than happy to do so.And the Liettes, the ever so supportive and loving parental figures. Loved the humor in the book, well.. hmmm... o won't add much of Charles or Sophia as many would be writing but them, so i focused on the characters that I don't think should be missed out.<br /><br />The book has lots of symbolism, and it's hard to come across such books these days that has elements of symbols,supernatural, something more like a fairy-tale, morals, etc all in one book, and I very much liked the whole myth on 'The Forever Girl', its just like that of the 'old souls' as we call them depicted in a different way.<br /><br />Aww, I don't want to add spoilers.... It is indeed a very wonderful read and am definitely looking forward to the rest of the series that follows. Becca is definitely one the new writers in town to look out for.
0761169253|5.0|In Steal Like an Artist, Austin Kleon offers excellent and direct advice for those with confused and romantic notions of natural ability and pristine originality.  It should be a required text for all studio art and creative writing courses.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I can't put it down. The hat and magnet really helps to achieve goals.
1932735410|5.0|I read the whole book and must say it is very well writen. It presents the PMBOK material in an easy and down to earth way that makes understanding much simpler.  I took the PMI exam prep seminar a few weeks ago and I think this book is great compliment in preparing for the PMP exam.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|The game has a major flaw, where dominoes in play stack on to each other and both become playable.  Needs some bug checking before it will be usable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun and challenging.  Can be addictive when trying to open more games.  All ages should be able to find at least one game they enjoy.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Runs great on Kindle Fire. It is a good diversion from work! I am impressed so far by G5 Entertainment.
0812968255|5.0|First, the book: it is standard paperback perfectbound. Nothing special, but not exceptionally bad. I believe the hardcover is also perfectbound (they should call it \\"lousybound\\") instead of sewn; and why would I buy a hardcover, if the binding is not sewn? It won't lay open flat, which makes it even harder to read than a paperback! For $8.00, cheaper than some others, this translation is by far the best on the market.<br /><br />Hays is faithful to the Greek (sometimes overliteral, rarely overfree), more so than other translations. Hays manages to transmit more of the style and mood of Aurelius' actual writing than any other translation by an order of magnitude: this can be a blessing or a curse.<br /><br />However much I demand that my Bibles be literally/formally translated to carry over as much as possible even of the order and form of the God-breathed words (I can't read Hebrew or Aramaic), it's not something I desire in literature, for which, being uninspired (except artistically), the actual words and idioms used generally have no great value, the value instead being in the sense of the text. (I think Hofstadter's Godel Escher Bach is an exception to this, and can't imagine that it can be translated, as so much of the meaning of the book depends on form and peculiarities of the English language.)<br /><br />St Jerome had much the same opinion, stating, I believe in an epistle to St Augustine while defending his (debatable) choice of translating his Vulgate from the Jews' modern Hebrew (which had already entered in on the process of eliminating prophecies of Christ, leaving us with gems such as, \\"like a lion my hands and feet\\", which, with different pointing, reads, \\"they have pierced my hands and feet\\" - the first one doesn't even make sense!) instead of their ancient Septuagint Greek: \\"When translating the sacred scriptures, I attempt to give Greek and Hebrew a clothing of Latin, retaining even the word order so far as it is possible [that is, formal translation: in the process giving rise to \\"Ecclesiastical Latin\\", as the Vulgate is no more Ciceronian or Virgilian Latin than Spanish is] but when translating the works of men, I endeavor to translate the sense of what is being said, not only the words [that is, dynamic translation]\\".<br /><br />De Selincourt's translations of Livy are some of the best examples of the latter. Livy is far from inspired: I care little about the form of the words he used, but the sense. De Selicourt's translation has me laughing aloud, much as I imagine the original readers would have, at the constant ineptitude and malice of the tribunes, always pushing for \\"agrarian reform\\" as a rallying-cry. Ancient historians did not set out to write just a history, but also a work of great literature: mere modern history was accounted unworthy of the pen, and was for the annals of the priests, to be recorded in lists of names, locations, and dates. Names, locations, and dates do not alone a history make: the ancients understood this. That's why ancient history, from Livy to Plutarch*** to Suetonius to Xenophon to Tacitus to Polybius, is uniformly excellent, and why modern history is uniformly bad in comparison. The best of modern history, the transitional and seminal Decline and Fall of Gibbon, is the closest one comes, but it is colored and ruined by a deep hatred of all things clerical, Catholic, and Christian, which absolutely permeates the work, and a subtext of love for the barbaric Mohammedans, whom he viewed as \\"rational\\" in comparison. At least he got his bias towards the degenerate Byzantine empire and its ossified Orthodox religion right.<br /><br />***Speaking of Plutarch, one has two choices: the modern and decent translations of Penguin in horrible editions, issued in half a dozen books with many lives overlapping (i.e. Alexander is in two books, Caesar in three) in a series that is still incomplete, with the lives presented out of order and Plutarch's comparisons either omitted entirely or presented after one of the lives mentioned, whereas the life being compared to is not even in the same volume, let alone back to back: or Modern Library's old translation from the 1600s (updated in the 1800s to remove the most archaic verbiage and most of the archaic pronouns) that reads poorly (even worse than Dickens, and I hate Dickens), as a stereotyped \\"classic\\", but is presented in two volumes in correct order with the comparisons, much as Plutarch intended. One needs both editions, so one can read the Penguin translations in the order given in Modern Library, and then read Modern Library's printing of Plutarch's comparisons of lives. (If one had to choose one or the other, the trade-off for readability in the Penguin is too great, compared to the poor presentation: one should choose the Modern Library.)<br /><br />That brings me to the best of the \\"truly modern\\" historians, Steven Runciman; his work is terrible compared to the ancients, and stellar compared to the rest of the moderns, who are more suited to writing technical specifications or books of law than anything else. Lest anyone think the moderns are more truthful or less biased, Runciman's obsessive fawning over that same decrepit Orthodox religion and overweening sympathy for the degenerate Byzantines (and even a hint of sympathy for those enemies of all civilization, the paynim foe, the Mohammedan, who had encroached on the lands of Christendom for four centuries and were slaughtering and enslaving pilgrims to the Holy Land to attempt to prop up their failing empire by trying to acquire new sources of dhimmis wherever they could be found) should dispel that notion - only sourcing has been improved. But even with bibliographies, one can choose and weight a work towards those extremely biased sources, such as Anna Komnena's report of the Crusade (which Runciman relies heavily upon). Warren Carroll is likely the best historian of our generation, with Jaroslav Pelikan close behind; but Jaroslav Pelikan, unlike Carroll and Toynbee, did not do \\"surveys of history\\", but focused on a very specific topic. Much as all of the professions, except for the noble philosophers and theologians (and even those, to a degree) have become so cripplingly overspecialized as to be facetious to non-specialists.<br /><br />Some philosophy (notably Aristotle) requires the translation to be stiff if one is to follow Aristotle's thought, and not the translator's interpretation of his philosophy (much like the Bible), which can never be trusted today. It reminds me of the old Bollingen Plato which I had to use when studying philosophy, before the much better Hackett editions and the new single-volume one were released, where all of the introductions gushed, \\"Plato was so smart - almost as smart as we (Hume, Locke, Kant, Hegel, Heidegger) are!\\" (blasphemy - Aristotle had more philosophical sense when he grunted to take a shite than Hume did in thirty years of writing ponderous tomes of trash).<br /><br />For other translations, \\"The Emperor's Handbook\\" is lousy, IMO. It's too loose. I cut my teeth on Staniforth's translation, which is archaic, overly flowery, and too loose at the same time. I think the Hammond translation is the second best (after Hays) out there.<br /><br />I also prefer Hays immensely because he leaves \\"logos\\" untranslated (instead of translating it as a range of words, improperly injecting interpretation in to the text, as no one option, such as \\"reason\\", works in all places in the Meditations), and, reading the book as a Catholic, I am often amazed at the insights towards Christ (the Logos) that are revealed in the jarring disconnect between the English translation and the transliteration of \\"logos\\" - I often think that Emperor Marcus Aurelius was writing about Christ; whether by accident of language, coincidence of Hellenistic philosophy, divine inspiration, or because the Christian ethos had already so permeated the Empire by the time of the writing of the Meditations, I know not. Nevertheless, Hays' translation can be used in places nearly as a Christian devotional instead of reading like Enlightenment garbage crossed with paleo-paganism and new ageism, as the Staniforth translation reads (always capitalizing \\"Reason\\", \\"the Whole [as in, 'return to \\"the Whole\\" at death']\\"). When reading Greek philosophy, \\"logos\\" is such a common word it loses its power and distinction as essentially the Incarnate Word, appearing constantly in contexts where Christ never would because of the nature of truth, being seen as in a mirror darkly - not so in the Meditations, this translation has shown, wherever \\"logos\\" is, one can insert \\"the Logos\\" and get an even greater sense of Aurelius' text - I am tempted to say a sensius plenor.ry\\", but focused on a very specific topic.

There's not much to add to the many excellent reviews of this book, but there's also not much added to this edition.  If you already know this tale, don't bother with a few extra flourishes.  If this is your first experience, you can't go wrong with this edition.<br /><br />Crom laughs at your American Gods. He laughs from his mountain.
B007B8GI28|5.0|I don't get why there are so many negative reviews for season 2.  Let me say first, I loved season one.  I watched it on TV when it first came out and re-watched it at least 3 times on DVD.  Great, great season!  Now let me talk about how season 2 compares.  I don't think it has the same punch as season 1, because S1 was so surreal.  It introduced us to this doomsday land where hope is minimal.  It made us as viewers aware of a reality that cannot exist in our minds.  That's a big part of what made it so powerful.  But as season 2 is a continuation, how can it possibly reintroduce us to what we already know about the situation?  If it went on about how life became this way for the characters, it'd just be very repetitive.  Season 2 focus' on character development.  It introduces us further into the lives and minds of Rick & crew.  No, there aren't any epic Zombie apocalyptic scenes filmed in downtown Atlanta, we're passed that.  S2 is showing the characters finally being able to settle in, although not without a TON of drama.  I'm not going to spoil any scenes, but S2 has it's fair share of intense scenes.  Honestly I can't understand all the dissatisfaction from some fans of S1.<br />Lastly I will add that I am NOT a follower of the comic series, which may have something to do with the negative reviews, i'm not sure.  But from someone who just enjoys the show for what it is, I will still say that Walking Dead is the best show on Cable and easily rivals anything on HBO & other \\"premium\\" channels.  Don't miss Walking Dead!!!

0374275637|4.0|Dr. Kahneman presents research that examines two systems in human brains that he calls System one and System two. System one is fast, intuitive and makes decisions based on observable points and from memory. System two thinks logically and slower, but is lazy and often accepts what System one presents. This results in biases and decisions not supported by accurate evidence.<br /><br />This author hopes that readers of his book will learn to think more clearly through understanding the research and ideas he presents. The book does not read quickly but is well written and informative.<br /><br />On page 417 & 418 the author states that organizations are better than individuals when it comes to avoiding errors (in thinking) because they naturally think slower and have the power to impose orderly procedures.<br /><br />He is advocating libertarianism paternalism, a style of protecting people from their own thinking. This happens through government controls. The author says the Obama Democratic administration has adopted that policy.<br /><br />(This surely is one root of dissatisfaction among Americans now.)<br /><br />Probably human brains have more than two systems that control our thinking, but scientists often research basic processes thoroughly before studying more complex issues. That seems to be the case with Thinking Fast and Slow.
0316017930|5.0|Success and you- A book review  Recently, I read an intriguing and engaging story about success. Most of us look at success as becoming someone like Bill Gates, or Donald Trump. Perhaps you've thought to yourself, gee, wouldn't it be great to be ridiculously rich, or gosh, wouldn't it be awesome to be just like LFMAO? In Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, the author takes us on a journey into the reasons why success becomes reality, and why some people fall into the other end of that spectrum.   Whether or not you are a student or faculty, this engaging book is for you, because it will answer those questions and many more in its winding journey in knowledge of success.  This book tears into our preconceptions and notions of what success actually is, and a large amount of factors that directly affect us in this quest. Gladwell tells so many little stories and anecdotes that grab your attention and make you go \\"Whoa!\\" that it becomes hard to put down. Some books are what we call page turners, but this book is more like a cover to cover read that is nearly impossible to put down due to its enthralling, informative gait.   Have you ever wondered what makes star hockey players good? How about just exactly what the factors were for Bill Gates' wild success? What if there was a magic number that could show you that you are destined for success? Have you ever given your cultural background much thought, and if that said background might your stepping stone to your own success?  How about an interesting stereo type explained, like why are Asian kids so good at math? All this and more are answered in stunning detail within the pages of Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, The Story of Success. Available in soft or hardcover, this 296 page book is a must have for your home library, and if nothing else, a great read for the next long trip you may find yourself on.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really am enjoying playing this game.  IT is fun to follow the plot. and to  see where it leads.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I've never really been big on musicals but I love this one. Even musicals that include songs that I like, also have songs that I want to skip. But these songs are all great, I wouldn't leave any of them. The acting is hilarious, Rick Moranis and Levi Stubbs are perfectly cast. And on top of that there are appearances of some great comedians including Steve Martin, Bill Murray, and John Candy. The most amazing thing is the plant. They use and actual prop instead of the computer generated monsters we see nowadays that look totally fake. It actually looks menacing as it gets bigger. Little Shop of Horrors isn't just one of my favorite musicals it's one of my favorite movies in general of all time.

B0052U59F4|2.0|I work in a mostly female environment and a few people told me about this book.  I had to see what all the fuss was about, and I must say, I am really disappointed.  The writing was terrible (if I read the term \\"oh my\\" one more time I would have screamed- it was used CONSTANTLY) and the writer clearly did zero research into the characters (what college student in 2011 doesn't own a cell phone or a laptop?  seriously?)  All of the reviews talk about the sexual tension and how hot the chemistry was between the 2 characters, but frankly I thought it was cliche, unbelievable and cheap (and believe me, I'm no prude) The heroine starts out the book with no sexual experience and by the end is a full blown nympho, having sex in places and ways that would make Jenna Jamison blush.  Basically it struck me as something that only desperate, middle aged women looking for a cheap thrill would read.  If you're looking for quality, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for poorly written erotica, you've found your book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|\\"So many humans.<br />So many colors.<br />They keep triggering inside me.  They harass my memory.  I see them tall in their heaps, all mounted on top of each other.  There is air like plastic, a horizon like setting glue.  There are skies manufactured by people, punctured and leaking, and there are soft, coal-colored clouds, beating like black hearts.<br />And then.<br />There is death.<br />Making his way through all of it.<br />On the surface: unflappable, unwavering.<br />Below: unnerved, untied, and undone.\\"<br /><br />I finally read The Book Thief after all the hype and I was not disappointed. I now know what all the fuss was about.<br />Zusak makes perfectly balanced use of plot and language; it is a fascinating, exciting story that is beautifully told. Zusak's writing is lyrical, especially through the words of Death, the story's narrator. And oh, the characters! I think characters are what make a story, and these characters are unforgettable.<br />There are so many WWII/Holocaust novels out there, and I think this is one of the superior ones. Like the title character in his story, Zusak uses words to tell a brutal story in a beautiful way. Brilliant.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very challenging and fun. I have played many mahjong games and this one is a great, challenging game. By far one of the best mahjong games around. Fun for the novice and experienced player.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best app ever it has almost every fun game in the world. you will have the best time of you're life.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds. since the day I got my kindle fire-12/13/11-I have spent every day playing this game. it's fun, addictive and flawless. actually my only complaint is why there have to be ads showing up pretty much all the time. it gets annoying after a while and the ads are pointless. nevertheless it is a great game but they really have to do something about the ads that keep popping up.

B004UHSB5A|3.0|have you ever noticed that Amazon was giving away amazig dtuff two days ago?<br />now they are giving not so amazing stuff, then everybody will start complaining, then amazon will give amazing stuff again, but nobody will say anytthing about it, and then they will start to give amazing stuff again.<br />with respect to this app, its not too good, it can not be moved to the SD card, and the graphics are not the best, as well as the gameplay can turn frustating, I was expecting more from a 2 dollar game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love all Stephen King books, but was a little hesitant to preorder this book. Plus, at the time I was trying to muddle my way thru another read that just wasn't catching my attention. This was to be a 'treat' for myself for finishing the other not-so-captivating read. Well let me tell you -- from the very start of this book, I was HOOKED, line and sinker! It is a great read, Fans! I love it -- thank you, thank you, thank YOU, Mr. King!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is good not great. its a good way to kill time. overall, I am glad I have it.

B0071QIN00|5.0|Awesome game. I wish there was more than 30 levels. Truly addicting and difficult at points but I really love a challenge.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This xgrip helped me to hold camera at lower angle, and I was able to mount a microphone or LED light on top.  It's good that there are several positions where I can mount the camera.  I wish the bottom legs were wider so that I could also mount the entire handle on a tripod.  It wouldn't fit on my tripods, and it's kind of hectic going back and forth.  The unit itself is quite light as it was made of plastic, and I would prefer plastic as my camera and lens are getting quite heavy.

B0041KKYDI|2.0|...might have been a better title for this movie. It's a very short story of a self-indulgent youth who suffered the consequences of his foolish arrogance and lived to tell the tale. But, rather than create a compelling backstory which fleshed out the character of Aron Ralston, it merely filled time with disconnected flashbacks, hallucinations, fantasies and premonitions which added little to the tale.<br /><br />Aron begins his escapade with such adolescent carelessness that it's difficult to feel empathy for the character. He does have brief moments of emotional honesty during the ordeal, but they're a bit too contrived to encourage any real connection with or compassion for the young man. The denouement that we have to wait for through all the stuffing, is not nearly as realistic or compelling as one might hope.<br /><br />As an outdoor adventurer and wilderness guide, wilderness EMT and rope rescue specialist, I didn't find even the canyoneering element particularly interesting or the self-surgery very realistic. I hope the book was better. I would not recommend this movie.<br /><br />Edit to add: If your DVD includes the deleted scenes, watch the alternative ending - it's far better than the included one, adds some good followup elements and makes Aron a more real a person than he was in the movie.
B00511ONPG|5.0|I'm a self-proclaimed nerd who has been doctor-diagnosed as someone who lacks the ability to focus on long boring tasks. I've never been one to complete a book in one sitting, but this one was filled with enough interesting content that kept me turning pages. For someone who has the attention span of a gnat, I found that I was able to read the entire thing (and retain most of its contents) during a flight from DC to San Francisco. That, in my eyes, speaks volumes about the way the information was presented -- extremely well.<br /><br />I love anecdotes, and this book was chock full of 'em! Maybe it's because I have an interest in social media and how to be amazing while using it, but I found that the examples could be applied to multiple industries. I currently work in the nonprofit sector, and we're always looking for ways to engage our followers and donors. For the nonprofits out there, you'll find great information that you can use to help spread your mission to the masses. It's easy to read, fun and it'll help you as you brainstorm about new campaigns for outreach.<br /><br />Likeable Social Media for the win!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its a nice app but the words are scheduled to appear at a certain time its nice but its watt easy to figure out how it works.

B003EY7IRC|4.0|This book does tie up most loose ends, though I would have liked to have seen her mend fences with Dani. Some people are left frustrated with not having Barron defined, but what is more important is that it is clearly defined what he is not. Good book. I see many opportunities for other spin off book series...the unseelies, seelies, siedhers, Druids and Dani to name a few. Many possibilities... Good book!
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I'm just almost utterly speechless as I listen to this cd for the first time. I'm a big Sinéad fan, and though I've respected anything she's released, some cd's I simply enjoyed more than others. This cd is by FAR the best thing she's done since at least Faith and Courage. Im sure any true Sinead fan is going to be experiencing the same 'wow' I'm enjoying at this very moment. This cd is a very sweet reminder of why we fell in love with Sinéad 25 years ago. Five stars out of five stars HANDS DOWN! Wow!
B002BWP49C|3.0|Watched with my 11 yo DD, who found the sex scenes exhausting/boring and the fight scenes too dark to see & therefore lacking. Watching the special feature DVD provided an insight in the Director's interpretation of the story. I thought there were key points that were pivotal that should have been further developed. This part of the story turns much of the plot & should have been given more care...For example, the changes in the werewolf dynamics and the imprinting scene. Make sure to check out the teaser at the end of the credits of the movie...I think the last movie shows great promise.
0385333846|5.0|I've seen several reviews on Kurt Vonnegut's most famous novel saying you'll either love it or hate it. This one took me a few chapters to get into, but by the end I can honestly say it's one of my favorites. The way into the story for me was to see the world as the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, sees it. Which is to say Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time and bounces around his own life more as an indifferent observer rather than one living it. He still feels pain and experiences joy, but Billy is detached about what comes next. Stuff happens, so it goes.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-Five is part science fiction, part anti-war apologetic and part unconventional narrative. For most readers, if you give the tone of the book a chance, you're sure to discover something revelatory in Billy Pilgrim's story that relates to you.

The second cd is newer songs and so nice to here the progress made through the years...I always liked A ha and it's like listening to a new band with  the familiar feeling of the 80's grown up. They were amazing in being so different. Buy this and the dvd to go along with it. Both are truley relaxing and enjoyable. My neghbors are taking turns watching the dvd.

0062082353|1.0|I am a huge patriot and was excited about reading about someone that has worked to defend the rights of our country. The first part of the book when Chris was telling his early life experiences was pretty good, it gave you a mental picture of what Chris was made of and what helped to form the person that he was. After that it was all down hill. Maybe if he had not continually boasted of how himself and his fellow seals were incredibly humble it wouldn't have been so bad, but his opinion of himself and how he ranks against so many of his fellow soliders made me sick. I have a hard time \\"not\\" finishing a book when I start one, but was hoping he would snipe me just to put me out of my misery while reading this book. I think his acheivments are huge, I just wish someone else had wrote his story so I didn't have to suffer through his arrogance and his constant comments of his love of war and killing.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|fun. follow up their amazing debut Aim and Ignite with an even stronger second album. Evolving their sound to include hip hop and electronic elements the band produces some of their best songs yet. From Some Nights Intro to Out On Town I listen to the album straight through without having to skip any tracks. Highlights of the album are Some Nights Intro, Some Nights, We Are young, All Alone, Stars, and Out on the Town.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are really fun, but there are a lot of pop ups.  Its a good game to waste time.
B007BLEXMC|5.0|The two-part episode left me speechless and wanting more, and diminished all doubt that the show was following the same, tired plot and story progression; going so far as restoring my faith in the show. I hope it continues!<br /><br /> I chuckle when thinking back on the comments made by another reviewer under the title \\"The Castle is crumbling\\" on the \\"Pandora\\" episode.  I greatly enjoyed the plot twists and turns; the writers deserve a standing ovation for their work, and I admire them for their efforts.  As always, superb acting from the cast....<br />Not to spoil for those who have not seen the episode but, I was afraid Kate was going to start losing interest in Castle...<br />Oh and... I would like to mention that one of many reasons the two-part episode left me impressed and speechless was due to a certain revelation presented about Castle.<br />We have a story arc that deals with Kate's past, but its refreshing to see a little more of Castle's past being revealed! About time!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was the most compelling and heartbreaking love story I have read in a long time. Picoult's way of writing from different view points is really what sets this book apart. I loved how it went from Chris's point of view and sharing his thoughts and emotions, to Emily's parents and back again. It really gave you a sense of what each character was thinking and feeling, as well as making the characters seem like real people I could relate to.  I've read several books by Picoult and I have to say that this one is my favorite. It mixes a love story with tragedy and mystery. At one point I even thought that Chris was actually going to be convicted of killing Emily when I could tell just by reading his thoughts how much he really loved her and cared for her.
0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing. I think everyone should read this because it is so beautifully written and the characters seem so real. I am literally in love with them! Just read it.
B004TMPJP6|1.0|I love the functionality of wunderlist.  It's been great on my Mac.  I can't wait to see it on my Kindle Fire. More and more my Fire goes to meetings with me instead of my laptop.  The website works, but when I'm away from wifi

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I A lot of fun, especially when you get it for free. I would probably pay for it knowing how good it is.
0812992792|2.0|Maybe I'm a philstine, or maybe I just don't get it, but while I desperately wanted to love this book and become immersed in it (I haven't really enjoyed much of what I've read thus far in 2012), that didn't happen.  I enjoyed the first part, but once I got to the second part I found myself distracted, confused and wondering if I should even finish it.  Specifically, I found the second part very difficult to follow; I had problems figuring out who was who, who was talking, etc.  In that sense it reminded me of Wolf Hall, another book that got blockbuster reviews but that I had difficulty following (as did many of my friends who attempted it).  I've given it two stars (rather than one) because the author does a good job with the atmospherics and, particularly, the all too real unreality of North Korean propaganda.
1451627289|2.0|Don't get my two star rating wrong: I love Stephen King. Well, most of the time. Hmmmm. Scratch that. Some of the time, that time when he is writing well, listening to his editors and living up to his considerable talent. And just for the rest of you King-o-philes out there, my fave is \\"The Stand\\". Which has a good deal in common with this latest offering. As someone who grew up amongst the baby boomers, and has dim memories of watching JFK's state funeral on tv as a wee tad, the assassination of this president was the 9/11 of my generation. It read just like a Stephen King novel, where in the everyday life of small town America, something terrible lurks just outside your field of vision. You can sense it, feel it, fear it. And you know there is no way to stop that terrible thing from coming at you. And so I turned to this tale of \\"if you could save JFK, would ya, could ya, and if so, how? with a pleasant sense of anticipation. Alas, in the first few pages I came up with the most annoying and persistent character in the novel: Stephen King's outrageously bloated ego.  What happens to mega successful authors? You know, the kind who have a huge bestseller, a great read, maybe even a string of great reads, and who then start publishing lazy crap. Do they just get so big for their artistic britches that they forget to try? So full of themselves they blow off the advice of the editors they once longed to have champion their work? I just don't know what happens, but it sure happens here.  King has a great story going, and he can sure tell one. But at every twist and turn, he's there, larger than the life he is writing about, grinning and making some self congratulatory little joke or comment just to remind you how stinkin' amazing Stephen King is, and how really dumb and inattentive us poor reader slobs are. He makes twinkly little remarks to explain plot devices that speak quite eloquently for themselves. He repeats himself...hey, if it was good the first time, let's doit again and again! For no apparent reason! He has some lovely vignettes, just perfection (the dance sequence in particular is breathtaking), but he doesn't work very hard at stringing them together. In the end, and thanks to a very hasty deus ex machina ending peopled with unexplained characters and events, those vignettes end up rolling across the floor like so many pretty beads, all dusty and ruint. It's sad.  That said, he creates a lovely and mostly believable set of stories. A lovely romance, a sobering portrait of Lee Harvey Oswald and the time he inhabited. But in the end, he let me down. His editors, who must have been utterly demoralized by watching him fail to bother to live up to his potential, were let down. He disrespected us. All of us. And most of all, he disrespected the event that ties his tale together, and the characters who could have, should have, illuminated the tale.  I feel like writing a note to his mother:  Dear Mrs. King, Stephen is a lovely boy and very bright, but he fails to live up to his potential. How disappointing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Beautifully written. Plot and character development top notch.  From the first page to the very last - just couldn't put it down.  Best in class!!!!!
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is very fun and entertaining. I got it when it was free which makes it that much better.
B005IQXUQW|5.0|Choosing Desert Island Discs - even multiple disc sets - is a dicey business.  No matter how alluring a choice might be at a given moment, familiarity and exposure and time spent listening may drop the rank a few notches, at least temporarily.  A very, very, very few discs or sets stand out, nonetheless, and seem to be desert island listening from the first compelling notes.  For me, this completely marvelous Cafe Zimmermann set of JS Bach instrumental music challenges the test, and passes with gold medals all around.  CZ is a small ensemble, but never sounds slack, thin, ho-hum, or dutiful.  If you want to hear your JSB played by musicians who really sound like they are having a whale of a good time, CZ likely is at least one among your probable choices.  I have many other fav shelf items wherein I cherished this or that, ... say, the Brandeburg Concertos, the Four Instrumental Suites, the violin concertos, the keyboard concertos.  I fell in love with all of them, with each of them.  CZ simply adds to, amplifies, and enhances the JSB fav shelves.  There is not a single outing in this plentiful set that cannot joyously stand passing comparison with any other reading on the shelf.  No matter who else sits in savory protection already, it is a distinct and varied pleasure to add Cafe Zimmermann to the existing collection.  So what about the playing?  Let's start with virtuosity.  Consistently the CZ players show a superbly fluent mastery of the technical aspects of playing their instruments.  Committed without exception, they sink deeply into rich tonal values, alert and meaningful phrasing, and all the readings are pervaded by the kind of energy and joy that seems to occasion human singing and music making in the first place.  From single notes to polyphony to whole paragraphs that end up seamlessly embedded in whole movements, CZ lays out the music finely indeed.  As a prior reviewer has noted, the selection on each single disc of this set is varied, so that one never has a chance to tire of some particular genre, even though JSB seems inexhaustible to most of us listeners, most of the time.  I suspect over time this set offers me so much, so continuously, that I may come to feel all of these really excellent readings as a sort of highly indulgent, luxurious, guilty pleasure.  Listening to these discs is like opening a six-layered box of Godiva chocolates, and the promises of such stimulating satiation on so many different musical levels may possibly leave me a bit dizzy or manic.  Think sugar rush, in the finest way of course.  Good news: nothing in these six discs is fattening, except perhaps to tingle the aural and kinesthetic senses, awaken the mind on more than one level, and valorize the genuine yet lush spirituality which helps us return to hearing JS Bach music, again and again and again.  Five stars.  For sure, this entire set, every track.  Bravo, Cafe Zimmermann.  No regrets, none, none at all, not a hint of a whit.  CZ, you are a keeper that more than earns your keep.  Kudos, and thanks, to all involved in making this set possible.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I had heard a lot of hype about the book and then movie.  I finally got around to reading the book and completely loved it.  Well written, fantastic character development- hard to put down book.  Once finished with the book, I watched the movie.  Not a bad movie overall but, very lacking in character development and I do not think that it shows the bond between the women writing the book. I feel that had I not read the book first, the movie would have been lacking as far as my feeling for and with the characters.  That said, the acting was wonderful and I did enjoy putting faces to the characters. Somewhat entertaining, yes. If you are considering seeing the movie do yourself and read the book first!
B001HN6922|5.0|Product arrived on time and as expected.  I am very happy with the purchase.  It made a great Christmas gift at a great price!  Would buy again.
B006MQRLSA|2.0|I love the game of baseball, so I'll read/watch anything about it. I settled in with Moneyball eager to spend a few hours on the story of an underdog team that triumphs over the big bad money teams.<br /><br />The thing is... at no point are you allowed to enjoy the movie. Every scene is darkened by failure and foreboding, especially when the general manager, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), is on screen.<br /><br />In flashbacks, scouts sign the young Billy Beane to a major league contract, but you don't see the celebration -- you see his failures at the plate. As Oakland A's manager, Beane applies a statistical model to form a rag-tag team that goes on to capture a mid-season triumph. Even at that moment, the camera focuses not on the celebration but on a glum Billy Beane, grousing that unless they win the last game of the season -- unless they take it all -- their mid-season feat is meaningless. This is what the entire movie is like -- dark, grim, humorless.<br /><br />For an underdog story to work, you have to root for the underdogs. The problem for me is that Beane is not a likable character. He is angry and morose. He slams around the locker room swearing at the players, yelling at the scouts, arguing with the coaches, brooding in his car, brooding in the stands, brooding on the field, brooding in the weight room. His sidekick, Peter Brand, the statistical genius with an economics degree from Yale (Jonah Hill), does nothing to lighten the screen. He's perpetually solemn, grim-faced, blank, present only to lead the viewer's eyes to Pitt.<br /><br />Who cares whether the strategy of these two Gloomy Guses works? I would have preferred a movie from the point of view of the players, with the back office a side note. The really big triumph is not the statistical model, but how the coaches turned this team of \\"misfit toys\\" into a credible major league team. For me, the players and coaches were the heroes of this story and their story remains untold.

B004FS27JK|5.0|In all fairness lets look at the price its so low even if it is a redo of the original greatest hits its worth it and the cover is beautiful.Also nthey have added Run To You on this cd.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|Samsung 4g touch  Menu &gt; Information = help, for those who don't know how to play. (only problem there is a repeated sentence)  Game play is straight forward, ends that add up to multiples of 5 get points. First to run out of tiles gets points.  AI will turn tiles for you. When dragging tile to location, look for glow on the tile you are connecting to and then release your tile, otherwise tile will return to your hand.  Game keeps going until either you or the AI reaches 250 or more points.  When tiles are played and locked between end points, the locked tiles get smaller to conserve screen space.  Generally a well done game. Only thing I had never seen before was where I placed a double 6 at the end of a line and the AI placed a double 2 up against it to score points. If this was a legal move, I was unaware of it and it caught me off guard.  Game play is intuitive and fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like the story part of the game.  The controls and the animations are top notch.  Great rules and play in a classic style of Mahjong
B0054JZC6E|5.0|AMAZING. works just like it says it does. I definitely reccomend it. no problems at all. works fine! definitely a five star!
B00192IV0O|5.0|I previously had this cd until it was stolen.  I loved it so much I had to buy it again.
0802798225|3.0|I know a lot of people rave about this series but maybe I'm just a little too old or have read too many books and expect more from my story.<br />Brittany was not my favorite person in the world but it was good to see her develop as a person as the story went on and to eventually let the facade she had put around her slip away and to stand up for herself at home. Her parents made me furious!<br />And Alex story was what I'm sure a lot of gang affiliated people feel..trapped.<br />But as for the so called 'Perfect Chemistry' I just didn't feel it. I can't quite put my finger on it but it just left me cold and not really caring whether they got together or not.<br />I do have to say though that I loved Alex' best friend.<br />I bought this and Rules of Attraction together as I had heard so much about them but that is the only reason I'll be reading he next one. And unless something changes drastically in the next story I wont be rushing out to buy Luis story.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was a book I couldn't put down. It was a love story and so much more. I am glad I went with the reveiws
B004UID2LC|1.0|I was excited about this app until my on-phone anti-virus alerted me that the application contained and had been reported for a virus, which resulted in an instant uninstall. Save your time and look for something more legit.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The only issue I have is more user related than anything; my fat fingers sometimes have a hard time grabbing tiny card edges, and occasionally I accidentally double-tap the screen, sending cards flying to unintended locations, costing me some moves.
B0000CAXID|5.0|Absolutely perfect. Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVED it, it's a fantastic album. You can never go wrong with Foo Fighters!
