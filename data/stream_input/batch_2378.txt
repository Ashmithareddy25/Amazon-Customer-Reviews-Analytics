B009X01FJS|5.0|I am completely satisfied with this Fire HD Standing Case and would definitely recommend it.. The standing option makes it easier to watch movies, play games, etc. There are small &#34;slots&#34; to use  enables the screen to be used at different angles, whatever is most comfortable for you to see. Although it is large, it is not heavy. I love  the color. This case protects the screen from being scratched when I put it in my bag to take with me.
B00B1RG3DO|1.0|I ordered this video in HD but it was shown in standard definition. At the same time Amazon still charged me for HD. I will contact them to see if they will reduce the charge. If they do not, then I will have to rethink my buying habits with Amazon
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Shows the depraved society we live in.  Trash and filth.  This type of writing doesn't take skill; it is awful.  People reading this probably think this is norma.  It is not normal.  It is devil inspired.
B000002ADT|5.0|It's the best-selling jazz album of all time. It's influenced artists in genres as diverse as rock and classical music. No matter how you look at it or whether you're even aware of it, Kind of Blue has influenced your life and your music in some fashion. After half a century Mile Davis' masterpiece continues to be one of the most impressive and beloved records ever recorded.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste a lot of time talking about this album because, in all honesty, I can't add anything to what has already been said about it. Jazz in particular is a difficult genre to deconstruct and talk about because it's so radically different from everything else. I could talk about how Kind of Blue it's based on modality instead of the hard bop style of his earlier records. I could mention that the band was only given sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise, having little idea what would actually be played. Lack of rehearsal was something Miles Davis was known for and that often resulted in honest and spontaneous takes that kept the music sounding fresh and bold. No overdubs or production touches were necessary. Or I could try and examine how this record defined a generation of jazz and experimental artists. In all honesty though, it would be a moot point. The music simply has to speak for itself and it speaks louder and more coherently than I ever could.<br /><br />This is a must-have for any jazz fan. Heck, it's a must-have for any music fan in general.
B007BLEKPM|4.0|Mr. DiCaprio was excellent. He turned someone who I was totally prepared to dislike (J. Edgar Hoover) into a human being for whom we could (and should) have empathy. Thank you for a GREAT performance!

B004DARF6A|5.0|Uncomplicated and fun for all ages.  This is a movie I love watching over and over again.  You just can't get any better than Chaplin!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|Definitely made me jump a bit, had some nice scares. I love paranormal movies and I thought this had a really good storyline, especially with how they were all actually skeptical or disbelieving of the paranormal themselves. Though it is another shot-from-their-camera type movies, the plot is very unique and I think they pulled it off really well, the actors did it justice.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This movie is so well-written and the story is so well-developed that you almost forget it is animated.  I still get emotional at the beginning and I have seen the movie over a dozen times...  That specific scene was handled in a perfect way for children, and some adults, to understand and process.  Kudos to the writers for this!  Currently shares the #1 spot in my mind with Finding Nemo.

B000002LAC|5.0|The smooth blend of their voices and the song selection are the best I have ever heard.  I bought this CD when it first came out many years ago and I wore it out.  I bought it again this year for a 20 something year old musician who had never heard it before.  He was very impressed as well.
B00B2JOJIM|5.0|Well-written and the performances of the lads are incredible.  Martin gives the words and Dave brings them to life in an incredible way.

B00BVYMZIE|5.0|I am so impressed with this series, they truly hit the bullseye right from the start.  The story is so compelling and the characters/dialog are smart.  I agree with the previous reviewer that stated first episodes are hard to impress with--not this one!
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I am crazy about real bridges and architecture in general. So finding this game practically made me giddy with anticipation.  So I have been having a great time building ,and so far seem to be doing quite well. Maybe it is all those years of stopping at beautiful bridges and looking over the structure and trying to understand the physics, or maybe it is just fun fulfilling the fantasy of building my own bridge even if it is only a game and would not hold up to traffic  reality. Hey..... it is a game so if it stands the traffic in the  game that is cool enough for me.  How about a fantasy game in which we can build old world cathedrals , that would also have my loyalty.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The movie seems to start out slow and quite frankly, I had trouble understanding the dialogue.  Halfway through, either I got used to the language, or they relaxed a bit.  Anyway, based on my understanding of Abe Lincoln, DD Lewis did a very fine job as did Sally Field.  For me, it was amazing that Lincoln seemed to circulate amongst the people like a common man; how the times have changed. Focus on the 13th Amendment rather than the Civil War was an unexpected emphasis for me; but interesting.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|As a rule, I very much dislike Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.  To find out that they were BOTH involved in revisiting the Collins family in a big-budget movie of my favorite tv show was a bit disappointing.  I waited until I saw the film on it's opening day to make a final decision and opinion.  I liked it but cannot explain why.  I disliked it but cannot explain why...  It was an interesting black comedy but never should have been a black comedy.  It was campy like the original, but the original was not necessarily supposed to be campy.  My final opinion is:  I liked it but really should not like it as I remain a 100% purist to the original Dan Curtis vision.  Barnabas is, and always will be, the great Jonathan Frid.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|Beautiful, moody, melodic and soothing.  Martin is still turning out fantastic, well-written tracks after all these years.  Dave is again, giving his all to the vocals and brings his &#34;A&#34; game to this album.  Wonderful effort on the lads behalf!
B006VZS1EA|5.0|I bought this on dvd for my grandson on Christmas, this being his 2nd since it was released because he watches it non stop and knows all the words and action by heart. So I decided to bye on my kindle so that he could watch it anytime anywhere that he would like. And now he watches it when we are watching something else witch is good being we have 6 other grandkids to keep busy. so yes this was a great bye for me.

0307474259|5.0|This book will challenge everything you have ever heard about dieting in a way that can change your life forever. I've never understood my body better. The information is laid out in scrupulous (and sometimes exhausting) detail. But it is a must read. Mr. Taubes message is not a new one but it is one that has been ignored for too long. I believe these ideas will become mainstream again very soon as Americans demand answers on why low calorie-low fat diets fail time and time again. Obesity is far more complex that most people realize and people face so much unnecessary prejudice because of their size. This book is beyond enlightening. I myself have struggled with my weight for as long as I remember. I spent many years dieting (tried it all). But since I started following this approach less than 2 weeks ago, Ive lost 12lbs with no hunger. No worry. Because I understand how my body works now. I am so glad I read this book.

030758836X|3.0|There is no doubt that, although quite preposterous in its premise, Gone Girl is rather well written.  At least up until about three quarters of the way through, at which point it started to fizzle (for me).  And the reason for this is that there are too many personas, each one contradicting (and in conflict with) the other in a way that is so hard for the reader to unravel.  It was incredibly hard to focus and keep it all sorted out.  It seemed to be jumping back and forth all over the place.  And in the end, it resembled a kind of algebraic equation in which everything cancelled everything else out.<br /><br />What also contributed to this feeling was that there are a lot of very not only shocking, but flagrantly crude and obscene, places in the book as well.  Such as Nick's description of Desi's mother Jacqueline as having a \\"lewd vaginal odor\\" coming off of her.  Which was meant to be funny I know.  Except that (for me) it really wasn't.  And other places where it talked about how Andie gave \\"blow jobs\\" to Nick on command, etc. At that point Amy was TOTALLY sinking to Nick's level and everything bottom lined.  Another shock was when the so called \\"real\\" Amy (writing as Diary Amy) spits in various containers in Greta's refrigerator.  (Greta being the all too obviously abused girl \\"Amazing Amy\\" has met at the sprawled out Midwest Hide-a-Way Cabins Village where she is tucked away to avoid the limelight). What was all that spitting about anyway?  I really didn't get it (or care).<br /><br />But the part that really got to me was how Amy used pregnant Shawna Hawthorne(already a proud mother of triplets) to fake her own pregnancy to the media.  (And get even with Nick).  By inviting Shawna to her apartment and getting her to take a pee in the toilet.  (Then collecting this illicitly obtained urine specimen from an already pregnant woman to use later on for a urine sample).  Give me a break.  The author's description of all this weird behavior started out funny, and it WAS sometimes funny to a degree, but overall Gone Girl TOTALLY BOMBED for me.
B004P02OJ6|4.0|Good movie.  A bit slow getting started, but last hour was great!  Would definitely recommend if you like drama and suspense with some action on the side.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|The legend of Robin Hood evolves for each generation and medium.  This version is a worthy entry in the chronicles of the outlaw of Sherwood Forest, both exciting and epic as it essentially gives a gritty account of the archer's origin.  Robin is introduced serving in the Holy Land under Richard the Lionheart.  The opening battle sequence is impressive, although certainly not unexpected considering director Ridley Scott's acomplishment with the Oscar winning Gladiator.  It's the Gladiator himself, Russell Crowe, as Robin Hood and he does a great job of fashioning a version of Hood who is human, heroic, but at all times alert and ready to act in desperate means.  The story has enough new turns to keep it fresh without feeling out of sync with the nature of the previous Hood tales.  The Sheriff of Nottingham is really only glimpsed here and there's no hope for Richard's return.  While perhaps not the definative version - for me that would be Flynn - it is a terrific film. Thanks to its mix of realism and adventure, it hits the target dead center.
B008FWHUQM|3.0|I would not claim that this is a good or a bad movie.  I enjoyed watching it and it kept me interested, so I liked it.  I would not be that interested in watching it again so it does not get a 4 or 5 in my opinion.

After 1 month, I have successfully lost enough weight to hit my first goal. It is a great life style change.  Feeling super healthy and rarely hungry.  This makes sense for me and my lifestyle.  I feel this will be successful for me.

0345803485|2.0|This book was poorly written. She repeats the same things over and over again. I was highly disappointed in this book. The characters are mind numbingly boring and dull. I wish I could take back the hours I wasted on reading this. It's a step down from Twilight, but with adults. I could have sworn a teenager wrote this book. Try the series by Sylvia Day, its very very similar, but written better.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|DJANGO UNCHAINED is Quentin Tarantino's homage to the \\"Spaghetti\\" Western.  Although I personally prefer the \\"traditional\\" Western (i.e. those directed by Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, Sam Peckinpah, and the like) than the oaters of Sergio Leone, I must admit that (with a few reservations), I enjoyed Tarantino's film immensely.<br /><br />The story begins in Texas two years before the Civil War.  Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schultz, a German-born dentist and bounty hunter who frees Django (Jamie Fox) from his slave trader owners because he is the only one who can identify a trio of outlaws that have a high price on their heads.  The two men work well together and, after Schultz gives Django his freedom, they become partners in the bounty hunting business, with the former dentist also promising to help Django find and free his wife (Kerry Washington).<br /><br />That search, ultimately, leads the men to Candyland, a brutal Mississippi plantation, owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).  Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson, in a fine multi-layered performance), Candie's devious, albeit trusted, house slave, suspects that Schultz and Django are there for cross-purposes, and this leads to a violent climax.<br /><br />DJANGO UNCHAINED is a handsomely filmed production that won well-deserved Oscars for its original screenplay and also the engaging supporting performance of Christoph Waltz.  The movie is filled with memorable scenes of action, as well as clever dialogue and moments of wry comedy, such as a scene in which a band of masked nightriders, one of whom is Jonah Hill, argue about their ill-fitting masks.  Indeed, several familiar faces (some almost unrecognizable), including Don Johnson and Franco Nero (the original Django) are present in brief roles.<br /><br />Many of the well-staged action sequences, particularly those in the latter third of the picture, are so \\"over-the-top\\" that they are almost cartoon-like.  Yet, that is one of the trademarks of the \\"Spaghetti\\" Western, and since, as previously stated, this is Tarantino's homage to that form, one must accept it.<br /><br />On the other hand, I do think that the picture could have easily lost fifteen minutes of its running time, particularly in the second half, and the gratuitous violence is, at times, a but too gratuitous.<br /><br />Finally, I found the character of Django, both as written and as portrayed, to be rather \\"unlikable\\".  Yes, as a former slave, Django has the right to be angry because of all of the horrible things that have been done to him, so you root for him to save his wife and also defeat the bad guys, but that's not because you \\"like\\" him.  It's because the bad guys are totally despicable.<br /><br />I won't be a spoiler, which is why I'm not going into detail here, but there are two moments in the second half of the film in which Django's actions are a total turn-off.  He's supposed to be the \\"hero\\" of this picture, but the choices he makes in these scenes are definitely not heroic.  Contrasting Waltz's character, there does not appear to be any warmth, compassion or humor in the man.<br /><br />That said, I liked the movie.  If you are a fan of Westerns (or just good motion pictures) and don't mind the extensive violence, I heartily recommend it.<br /><br />Extras in the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment include a trio of \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxmani\\" Western, and since, as previously stated, this is Tarantino's homage to that form, one must accept it.<br /><br />On the other hand, I do think that the picture could have easily lost fifteen minutes of its running time, particularly in the second half, and the gratuitous violence is, at times, a but too gratuitous.<br /><br />Finally, I found the character of Django, both as written and as portrayed, to be rather \\"unlikable\\".

B004HW7JMO|5.0|This is a NO MISS - MUST SEE prequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand!!  It is also the history of major characters that set this season on fire!! Their loves, their hate, their vengeance.......Most importantly of all this is the history of GANNICUS - Champion of Capua, and CRIXUS the Undefeated Gaul !
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Hayward is probably one of the most prolific singer/songwriters to come out of the 60's & 70's aside from McCartney & Lennon. He has touched on many different subjects over the years, and really in a variety of ways, through the Moodies, his solo work, Blue Jays, & other projects he's been involved in, and so, anything new from Justin or the Moody Blues is highly anticipated. He has a lot of history to live up to.<br />So, I just got my copy a few hours ago and popped it in my player after it came from Amazon. All I can say at this point is Yummy!<br />Gawd. Between the Justin's incredible voice and his outstanding songwriting skills, and the incredible production with great session musicianship, WOW, This is an excellent CD! Probably the best solo work from Justin since \\"Forever Autumn\\", and I have liked all his Solo works so far! How could I go wrong with this purchase, unheard?<br />Well, let me tell you in all honesty, there is not a bad cut on this CD and if we can't have a new Moody Blues LP, we may as well have quality Justin Hayward, instead! On my third listen, now.....<br />I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite song, so far. But, the lead off cut, \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\" is Hayward magic in song, once again! It should be released as a single if it hasn't been already! Other favorites on the disc at this point are: \\"The Eastern Sun\\", \\"Broken Dream\\" \\"One Day, Someday\\", \\"On The Road To Love\\" (a writing collaboration with Kenny Loggins who provides back up vocals and guitar as well!!), & \\"Captivated By You\\". Expertly done. Lush and beautiful!<br />Now, with that being said, here's the nice surprise (especially if you're into Dance Mixes or World Music) there are 2 remixes of the Moody Blues Classic, \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" on this disc. I am not able to tell if these are a new recording of if they actually use the Moody Blues sessions to make them (it's not documented on the CD cover or booklet) but, they are drop dead Awesome! WOW! Who would have thought?!<br /><br />This is a nice mix of tunes on different themes that all seem to string together very nicely to make a complete and wonderful listening experience. If you like the Moody Blues, or Justin Hayward, solo, either way, you're going to love this disc. It's going to be in rotation on my player a lot in the next few months! At least until Justin or the Moodies make an appearance somewhere nearby so I can go experience them live, one more time with feeling!<br />Thanks Justin for a Great New CD! I hope it's as successful as it should be!
B008EZVNO0|4.0|There are two strands to Van the Man:  Celtic musing and soulful blues.  Born to Sing is in the soulful blues category.  Tight arrangements (with nice horns) and Van in good voice.  If you like this side of Van Morrison (I do), you will like the album.  Having said that, like most recent Van Morrison albums it doesn't have the standout hit power of the songs he's famous for: Tupelo Honey, Domino, Caravan, Into the Mystic, etc.  So: good solid bluesy music without a powerful hooks that will stay in your head.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this based on all the hype.  Really found it stupid and pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Really!?  If you want a REAL novel reflecting women's sexuality read &#34;Lady Chatterly's Lover&#34;!!!!  At least it has some class and subtly.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The movie was tremendous.  The history that was as nearly accurate as possible, brings reflection on just what it means to be an American.  The willingness to stand when it would be much easier to sit and remain silent.  The cast of actors are to be commended for their dedication and creation of a movie that will become a standard for history classes everywhere.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Okay, that may be an exaggeration. The first book was obviously amazing. But I've forced myself through the last three books for the sake of the story, and this is the first one that's kept my interesting page after page!

0307352153|4.0|t's no secret that being an extrovert puts one at an advantage in American culture. For many introverts, they have learned (sometimes the hard way) that in order to be successful, they have to pretend to be an extrovert. Why is the case?<br /><br />In Susan Cain's book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking, she explains how the \\"Extrovert Ideal\\" came to be here in the West, as well as how the extrovert ideal isn't the \\"ideal\\" in other parts of the world. This has powerful implications for the global neighborhood- whether it be doing business with people from other countries, working with NGOs, long-term missions, or simply interacting with neighbors from a different culture down the street.<br /><br />In addition to HOW this ideal came about, Susan shares some interesting research on temperament (is it biological? environmental? both? can we change it? are all introverts the same?). Also, she shares some great stories about how introverts and extroverts think differently, and how that affects decision making, creativity, sensitivity, etc. I enjoyed learning about how some very \\"successful\\" people are introverts, and how their success had a lot to do with their introvert uniqueness.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book to me was the section titled, \\"How to Love, How to Work.\\" In it, Susan discusses when an introvert should act more extroverted than they are, how to encourage our introverted children, and how extroverts and introverts can communicate in a more effective way (helping meetings everywhere to be more enjoyable and productive!). I not only think this is an important discussion to have in the working world, but also in families and in the church body.<br /><br />Even if you are not an introvert, this book could be an interesting read for you- because it's guaranteed that you work, play and live with someone who in an introvert. Being able to understand introverts better can lead to being able to better serve and love those around you. Introverts grow up learning about extroverts, but rarely do extroverts slow down and think about what it would be like to be an introvert.those around you. Introverts grow up learning about extroverts, but rarely do extroverts slow down and think about what it would be like to be an introvert.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|During that time frame the escape of the few was overshadowed by the many in captivity.  This would probably be forgotten had it not be for movies like this.  The actors were excellent and their dedication to the accuracy of the character proves this out.  Excellent acting and directing.  Thank you for making this movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I found this to be a great read. So many women remain in these abusive relationship. I really liked her escape plan and her bravery. Although, I found the part with Jo a little unbelievable, it gave Katie/Erin all she needed to get to the next level.
B00358ESI4|5.0|I love war movies and this one was a realistic look into the mind of a brigade commander. Mel gibson was outstanding in this movie.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars has made amazing songs ever since he came out. This album proves that statement. I love each and every song in this album. Anybody looking for good music? Listen to this right here.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really fun.  The graphics are great.  My 9 year old son loves it too.  I would recommend this game.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a fun quick , very quick , moving game......I enjoy seeing the colorful diamonds, trying to beat the clock!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I bought this because I had seen Alabama Shakes on Saturday Night Live, and really enjoyed the unique sound of her voice.  Since buying the songs, have seen them on the White House Memphis Night,  Think they are really cool!  Couldn't find them at Wal-Mart or Target, then thought to look at Amazon.  Hadn't bought any music before.  The shipping time was great, and have been playing the songs on the kitchen player a lot.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is better than the free alarm app because you can actually control the alarm volume. Yeah, the free alarm is okay, but I can't say my sisters, parents, and neighborhood enjoyed the irritatingly and ridiculously loud alarm blasting from my kindle at 5 in the morning. Spend the 99 cents people.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Amazing App , fully recommended and addictive. It works perfectly. Easy to use for everyone ,  my two daughters and wife even my mom loves it.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|This is a great buy ands its the new model it really works great if this was bought through copilot 200.00
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sunway Surfers is the best side scrolling running game ive played.  Gt it! U will not b dissapointed! Trust me!
0761169253|5.0|Simple and easy to read.  Just some straight forward ideas about using what you see to make your statement.  Art and artists come from everywhere.  There is no straight path to become one and this little book is a fun read that tells you its OK to steal an idea and turn it into something of your own.
0099519852|5.0|So far, what I have read, is very interesting.  I am finishing another book so I can dedicate more time to this one.  Easy reading, interesting research.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie is a favorite for my friend and the blu-ray version is great.He has watched it i know more than ten times.In the short time we have had it.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|This is a great compilation of the history of film.  This film is long but filled with some of the most amazing moments in world film history.
0307949508|2.0|The first part of Larsson's trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was a great story--two mysteries running parallel and leaving the reader wondering where it would all fall out.  The second has left poor Stieg on unfamiliar ground.  He had to change his central character, The Girl, so much to cope with her role in the story that she is no longer recognizable as the same  person.  There was no explanation of how this drastic change had come about:  it requires more than the sudden acquisition of wealth, some plastic surgery, and extensive travels.  Likewise, the first novel was set entirely in Sweden, Larsson's home, and one could accept his descriptions of Swedish society, journalism, and governmental and legal practices as authentic.  In the second volume, he has had to describe American assumptions, behaviors, and legal procedure as well as the views and behaviors of American Christian groups.  In all cases he reveals typical European assumptions about and prejudices against Americans.  (I lived overseas long enough to become familiar with both.)  His description and naming of firearms, especially, reveal that he is way out of his depth.  I found this lack of authenticity too grating, and eventually tossed the book aside.  I doubt very much that I will finish it or read the third volume.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I always think I will hate the movie when I hear that thngs have been added that werent in the book.  But in my opinion the aditions are forgiveable and stay within the general mood of the book. I am waiting somewhat impatiently for the next installment.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Character stories, scene locations and dialogue continue to captivate the viewer.  I am especially enjoying the outstanding<br />colors and textures of the costumes.  The previous coats worn by the &#34;Hatter&#34; were breathtaking.  Kudos to all!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Not Brown's best. Though Langdon has worked his way throught several complex situations as in The DaVinci Code for example, he seems inordinately befuddled...grew tiresome.  It's an ok read but just so.
B004VFOT4I|3.0|While the movie is well done and attractively produced, it feels awfully long. What the author Jean Kerr once wrote, &#34;I don't want to see the uncut version of anything!&#34; would apply to this production.<br />I would have enjoyed &#34;one brief(er)shining moment that was known as Camelot.&#34;
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and addictive.  Only thing I don`t like are the pop up adds in between games.  I find th graphics and animation a quality product.  Find myself hooked when I say `oh I`'ll only play one more game`
B004UID2LC|2.0|okay this app was awesome for a while. I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and after about a few months it started acting funny and wouldnt let me watch any videos whatsoever. I tried EVERYTHING and it was still acting funny. So yea DONT get it, i think its the reason my Kindle Fire crashed :/
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A superior book with an atmosphere all of its own. Great language, great pacing, a great story, and a lingering magic.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really liked this game but wish that when you complete the village that there was another village to continue wish
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not as good as the hunger games, but has that hunger games touch and has amazing suspense and receipt ion, enjoy the amazing book,Mockingjay
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A terrific perfectly paced legal thriller and family drama. I could not put it down. A refreshingly good book after reading yet another so so John Grisham book before this.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The Movie: Well, when you have a fantastic personage such as Lincoln to reflect with so much literature to call upon, the scripting becomes self evident. It is worthy of noting that prior to some final scenes there were no actual clear close-ups of Lincoln, which is I suppose fair given that this story was more about the final efforts to pass the 13th amendment rather than Lincoln himself. As an educational tool, yes it is very good, but I believe that it will prove poorly used in that regard because of all things, politics.<br /><br />Amazon's Instant Video program -- the streaming video is great, the audio fantastic as well, and the price is worth while. There are no monthly contract payments to make. Indeed, it is more like the old standard video rental retailers where you went to the video rental store such as block-busters or even a mom and pop video rental center and pay the same overall price to take the movie home. Except there are no lines to wait for and there are no driving required and absolutely no late fees if you don't get it in by the due date. And there is still the ability to buy the movie for digital watching later or buying the movie in DVD format. The only flaw is that you have to pop your own pop-corn, which is its own draw-back do to the micro-wave smelly stuff that passes for popcorn these days.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit is a project that people have been waiting for for years now. There's been a lot of bluster about the movie being split into three parts, the high frame rate, new characters, and the critic's resolution was that the movie was a disappointment. As a Tolkien fan, I'd been keeping an eye on the movie's progress and worried over how it would turn out.<br />And I knew as soon as I heard the first line I knew that I needn't have worried.<br />This movie brings us back to familiar faces and places of The Lord of the Rings, yet brings us a more cheerful, family-friendly tale and crew, but still manages to bring in some of the moving, profound moments that made us love LOTR. And finally, people get to see what Bilbo, the kindly but slightly odd older gentlehobbit we remember from the LOTR trilogy has to offer. And Martin Freeman does a great job of bringing Bilbo to life. All of the other characters, including the dwarves, have an awesome family vibe to them; the scene in Bag End reminds me of various birthday parties my family has had throughout the years. Each of the dwarves gets their own, individual personalities, something the book didn't give us. Although in places the story line has been altered slightly, it still comes off reminding you of the fun, childlike book. We also have more of the epic score, and various nods to the trilogy are made in the movie. I know this has actually been the complaint of some, that there's too much of LOTR in The Hobbit. Well, both books were written by the same person, sometimes with the same characters, in the same world. Some of the things are going to be similar. And I, personally, like the little run on jokes.<br />On a note about ordering it, the DVD was accurately priced, and arrived on the day the movie came out, since I pre-ordered.<br />Since the next movie in the trilogy doesn't come out until December 2013, I'm glad that I have this DVD to tide me over until then. If the rest of the movies in the trilogy are as good as this one, I can't wait to see them and add them to my list of favorite films.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is one of those movies that I can watch repeatedly without growing tired of it.  It's a really enjoyable movie with some great music, too.
0982743726|5.0|Someone once told me that it is a bad idea to read books from bad authors because it will negatively affect the way you write. When you pick up Walter Rhein's book \\"The Bone Sword\\" ... that is not something you have to worry about. From beginning to end, \\"The Bone Sword\\" is well written. Rhein wields metaphors brilliantly and demonstrates his mastery of the craft. He sprinkles his action with gore that I never felt was overdone and he unfolds a story about a solitary warrior named Malik. This is one of those books that maybe you have never seen on a shelf or possibly ever heard of...however, I believe, if you give it a chance, you will embark on an enjoyable journey through the lands of Miscony.
B004JRVQX0|1.0|Unbelievable.  You've used the same Samplitude dongle for over a decade, even duck taping it at one point due to an unfortunate accident, but your POS iLOK died in under four months.<br /><br />No problem, you are still under warranty  As you work your way through the iLok website and notice the incredible lack of meaningful information on the return process you begin to wonder if your connection has been hacked and you've been redirected to some 3rd world scam site who's hackers barely had enough English between themselves to piece this front together.  Sadly, you come to the conclusion that this is indeed the iLok site.  Hmmm... Support for Firefox versions above circa 2002 still pending.<br /><br />A website that doesn't work with one of the world's most popular browsers.  OK.  You reluctantly reinstall Explorer just to visit iLok, just to return merchandise that should still work after 3 months.  Moving parts? no.  Reason for failure? unknown.  Crap from China?  Assumed, but this is sad by even these standards.  You continue.<br /><br />What's this?  If you are under warranty everything will be okay?  That's great.  But wait, why then do you need your credit card info?  Well, reading down the page will surely explain the- hmmm... no explanation.  But here's something about ordering a backup iLok.  Hmmm..\\"what is an iLok\\", you wonder.  It's something to keep you from copying the software and giving it to all your friends.  Software you bought.  With your money.  That you worked for.  That the software company now has.  And all you want.  Is to use it.  So-  do you agree to purchase a \\"backup\\" iLok?  A backup in case you can't prove you have the legal right to use the software you purchased because a 2 dollar piece of junk from China failed?  You consider that you don't have a copy of your automobile title, which cost thousands of dollars.  You feel confident that if the title were to be lost, you could prove the car was yours anyway.  You consider that you only needed one lock on your locker in high school.  You decide against this \\"backup\\" iLok, since you aren't really sure about the concept of paying for a backup of proof of ownership of something. Oh wait-it's encased in plastic and can be held in your hand.  Maybe that makes it okay?  No.<br /><br />Still, the site insists on your credit card info to proceed with the RMA.  Backed into a corner, you withdraw your wallet from your back pocket. In go the numbers.  Now to stick some stamps on this piece of plastic and send it- whoah! The ilok site is recommending you use a carrier such as Fedex, else they can't guarantee your iLok has been received.  Let's see, how many packages has the post office lost in your life?  Quickly counting with your fingers, you realize the number is zero.  Yet, you're scared now, they may say they didn't get it.  OK.  $15.00 to return something that barely weighs an ounce.  Probably a week's pay to the poor worker in China who helped assemble the iLok.<br /><br />You wait.  Ah, at last, an email from iLok.  They have recovered your licenses and you can download them to an iLok of your choice.  Awesome, now you can- hey wait a minute.  You don't have an ilok of your choice.  Your iLok stopped working, so you sent it back for a replacement, or so you thought....What do they mean about recovering licenses, what about your replacement iLok?  you didn't lose any licenses, iLok knows your licenses, the software company knows.  What is going on here and what about the replacement iLok?  Emails to iLok.  No Reply.<br /><br />So.  16 1 star reviews of the iLok and 16 5 star reviews.  Make that 17 1 star reviews.  Better Business Bureau? Perhaps.  Attorney General letter?  Better idea.<br /><br />In the end, as disgusted as you are with iLok's business practices, you can't help wonder about the 16 Amazon reviewers that happily awarded 5 stars to a product they bought to prove they bought another product.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Its funny from the get go, it has great interactive conversations and one liners.  Its just an all around fun movie.
B002S45V32|5.0|This movie is a cult classic!  I recommend everyone see this move at least once in their lifetime!  Thumbs up!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's best with movies like this to just sit back and enjoy the ride without thinking too much about whether things are plausible, because they aren't.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie in the theater, and I've enjoyed it at home.  The mixing in the 7.1 surround format is quite nice.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|This app, although has the use of points which are still required to keep this app free, has unlocked the video feature for my kindle fire hd. Even though I dislike the points system for video you can simply  unlock the infinite video feature by playing coin dozer which is not that hard. The costumer service for the first time in app history listens to every single person and improves based on that you stated. And the best part about this app is because it has no cost. I recommend this to anyone that thinks the kindle should just  come with video. I know the kindle is men't for reading but why have a camera without being able to completely use it. Excellent app guys nothing better has yet to come.
B00B22IJXK|4.0|Not bad for simple stuff and effects but glad I got it free as if I was going to buy a program there are much better ojes
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I don't use it as much as I thought I might,  but works well.  I have had no issues with this app.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I read this when I was young. I am now 60 and it is even better the second time. The charcter development is so perfectly Steinbeck. I wish the book had another 500 pages.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|It displayed helpful info when planning a trip. I used it for checking out a few places on one short trip. There were ratings and reviews for many locations.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It is the best one made I've played plz get it I hope it gets super popular I totally recommend this app
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a couple of different friends, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The story is a good one, with interesting characters, mystery and intrigue. I recommend to anyone who is a fan of paranormal fantasy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|amazing game! the motions are quite realistic. after you play for a while... then you get these random and annoying ads. they need to make those go away.
B005JABSB6|5.0|Have tried both these and the -30 glasses.  These are by far my favorite, as they work perfectly over my regular glasses and are quite comfortable.  The 30 series is just a bit too small in the lenses for comfort, and are distracting when watching the TV
B001UTW7QU|5.0|...is that it lets me binge watch stuff that I never saw on TV, since I rarely watch TV.  I am really enjoying this series, particularly the Walter character.  I am not quite a contemporary of his, and I certainly don't have his extensive experience with hallucinogens, but he's become my favorite Mad Scientist.  Good show.  Worth the Prime membership.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|It was amazing and anyone at the age of 10 should start reading these books.I love the books.Percy Jackson rules!!!
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Awesome album.  Awesome quality.  The lyrics in their music is just as relevant today as it was back in the 90's if not even more today.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is one of the few books I actually read as a young girl who didnt like reading. The sory kept me interested.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game on my fire.  No glitches or problems. Good game. Worth cost. Nice graphics. Clear and bright
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Somehow a teen fiction tale about the loss of humanity via a brutal, pointless media experience manages to miss its own message and become a trilogy franchise opportunity. To be fair, the premise has great potential but the writing and direction was lousy.<br /><br />Over long by a good hours, and if it was a Star Wars movie it was more episode 1 than episode 4.  For comparison I then watched The Langoliers, based on a Stephen King story, and even with the dodgy computer graphics at the end it managed more pace, excitement, and tighter writing.  Go watch it instead!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|The author takes you back and forth between humor and tragedy.  Just when youare laughing loudest you are hit with the horror of an uncontrollable tragedy.  I can't wait to read the follow-up &#34;T'is&#34;.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was honestly the best book I've ever read. I absolutely loved it. The book was very different from the movie and the book was better.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|We Grew up on this book every CHRISTmas. Now my kids can read it every year too. Thanks so much!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle's story is amazing and inspiring.  I was touched by his commitment to his duty and to his family.  His death was a tragedy and I'm glad he got the chance to tell his truth.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph is, like Monster's Inc, a fun family film.  The plot is simple, the jokes are funny, and the main characters entertaining.<br /><br />Then you peel back a layer, and it is a hilarious film for geeks and gamers who can happily play &#34;spot the licensed games&#34;, argue over the Q-bert translations, and spend hours afterwards reminiscing about their own game experiences.<br /><br />Best of all, Disney made a film about video games that wasn't just &#34;for boys&#34;.  The female characters are central to the plot, and not relegated to pink princess roles in castles!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome game. The game is challenging and fun at the same time. Also it is a blast. I love it.
B000FA675C|5.0|I've read this book many times, and was so happy to have found it in the kindle store for FREE.. I have enjoyed every book Dan Brown has written. An excellent read!
0062202081|5.0|My granddaughter is a huge  fan of JB.  She was so happy to get this. Glad it made her happy.
0920668372|1.0|Just read all the other 1 star reviews. I second all of them. First book I EVER bought for my child (based on a recommendation) and fortunately, she was 6 months old and has no memory of it. What are people thinking? I am so grateful I am able to return to Amazon without question. So go ahead, if you dare, and see what creepiness is in store. Or better yet, check it out from the library and then accidentally lose it. You'll be doing a greater good for another unsuspecting reader.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Didn't think 1 person and some nature could hold my attention as this movie did. Richard Parker really could have been best supporting actor.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wasn't expecting much, but this movie was very good. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Actually watched it a couple of times with the kids.
1439153663|2.0|I didn't like this book because it went from one crises to another.  It was too sad for me to enjoy.
1846556007|5.0|This is the book that started it all for Harry Hole.  His trip to Australia and encounter with a serial killer is different from the later books, but definitely sets up  his story.  I am thoroughly addicted to the Harry Hole series and reading his first foray after hints in the later books was very satisfying.
B002P79KAC|5.0|We love the show, but TBS and local channels have been playing the Season 1 and 2 episodes so we actually had seen most of them without realizing it.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Movie was horrible. I turned it off about 3/4 through it due to the terrible story line. I would rather watch paint dry for two hours. Absolutely horrendous. DON'T WATCH THIS TRAIN WRECK.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is the best Holmes show that I have ever seen.  Finishing up season 2 and looking forward to season 3...
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This is a delightful film with its tongue firmly in cheek!  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and especially Helen Mirren and John Malcovich have a great time as spies who come out of retirement for another operation.  Add Richard Dreyfus as a smooth villain and you have an enjoyable romp!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of our favorite shows on TV! If you haven't watched The Walking Dead you must do so, of course start with season 1.
B000RUAR5G|3.0|Not the greatest, but good for what it is. Older movie and the kids enjoyed it. Funny in spots, but a lot of dry humor. 3 stars. Worth a watch.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|This movie was depressing. And it was not that good. Don't waste your time or money. It's 123 minutes I will never get back. The only reason I didn't rate it a single star is that the cinematography was pretty good.
B008602KQI|4.0|It's difficult to follow a popular book on film/vid, but this vid did a good  job of it.  Who could complain about Jen Lawrence, Harrelson, and Southerland?  I liked it and hope they'll do the sequels
B0050DZN4K|4.0|it's my favorite choice and best alternative to gReader. Using for more that month, now and I'm quite happy with its functionality and available options/settings.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a riveting story about the struggle of a poor Irish family.  Brilliant writing by Mr. McCourt.  I would recommend.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|First off, I'm glad to have an app that provides me with free access to music videos. Hence the three stars.<br />Sadly, this morning Vevo managed to pinpoint my geographical location through GPS and suddenly bombarded me with lists of irrelevant junk by Arab or Spanish &quot;artists&quot;. Is Vevo assuming that terrorists have overrun this section of the U.S.A., or is GPS wildly innaccurate? O_o Be warned - this app spies on you.  I must say, location is a piss-poor way to determine interests.  Don't even try, Vevo. Only mapping software needs my location.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Just like the movie. My kids love it and love to sing and dance along with the music.  They ask to watch it all the time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great group of characters. Loved the season two finale. I'm hooked on this series. On to season three...
B00ASMK7WG|5.0|The experience was perfect and my daughter is so happy to have her favorite movie which she will watch often..
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Fascinating story that gives you a picture of India that you thought was over... the status of women is horrendous.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Always liked the movie and it was a great price so I went for it. No problems at all, overall a fantastic buy.
0307346617|1.0|I did like some of the ideas, but I did not like the book, and the ending was absolutely ridiculous.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I found the movie on the big screen amazing and I wanted to own it.  It is beautifully done.  Thanks for getting it to me so quickly.
0744014549|5.0|The quality of this book is amazing, it's simply worth the buy for that sole reason. It's packed with concept art and imagery from the new Tomb Raider game. So glad I purchased this!
B005LAII8K|5.0|Fantastic movie. BlueRay package was a great price and is excellant HD quality. Spectacular movie as well. Great plot twists.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I am by no means a Lincoln expert. That said, I say in all honesty I have read over 200 Lincoln books. I own around one hundred Lincoln books currently. I've been to his home, the memorial, Ford's theatre, etc. I believe I've seen every Lincoln film made, excepting the recent vampire thing.<br />I say all this to give weight to what I'm telling you. This is the best Lincoln film ever made. Bar none. Daniel Day Lewis is extraordinary in his portrayal. His Lincoln is a living, breathing being, very human. Just as I'd expect him. Sally Field rises to the occasion. Her Mary Todd Lincoln is hard to like, just as the real one was.<br />The events of the film really occurred in the last days of January 1865 during the effort to pass the 13th amendment. Yet this isn't a history lesson, it's a character study, and a damn good one. Congress is little different then than it is now. Lincoln as president faced battles and opposition not unlike our current president. So unfolds a story that could be set in any era. But this one is real. And we are living with Lincoln's legacy.
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|A great album from one of our favorite actresses  liked the old songs highly recomend this album for anyone wanting to hear something different  what a suprise  she is superb on shameless  series also !
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book so much. It's a book you cannot stop reading until you are done. It was amazing.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|The price was the huge selling point. Such a quality movie and touching film, FOR ONLY $5! You can't beat that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but the characters cost to much but otherwise it is awesome and way better than temple run
B008KW43TE|5.0|The combination of music arrangement and the lyrical content made for a refreshing experience compared to other options in the hip hop unfused rnd genre. Def liking this!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I bought Les Miserables as a birthday gift for my wife. She really enjoyed the movie a lot. She said it was the best version she had seen.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|it stopped working one day and every time I try to get on my kindle fire says &quot;twitter has stopped unexpectedly
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Although the story is hard to believe in its entirety, it is captivating and very enjoyable. I have not seen the movie, but it has to be edited extensively. I have it on my Netflix list.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I found it hard to put down at times.  It shows what a person with determination can do to take control of their own life and get away from a bad situation.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I've played computer games for over a decade but have never really purchased a mouse specifically for gaming.  This mouse seems to work very well.  My only complaint is that the weights don't add very much to the overall weight of the mouse.  Even with all of them inserted, the mouse still feels fairly light.  Other than that, I don't really have any complaints and haven't had any problems.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed the story. The first chapter was difficult to get through but I continued and then it captured me.
0765325950|4.0|This book was excellent but it killed off too many of the main characters and left you hanging as to how Matt would end up his life with Fortuona.
B006IYG5HE|2.0|What a confusing mystery.  Impossible to follow. Finally read as fast as I could to get to the end and be done with the book.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|Excellent, love it! The original album artwork and lyrics are included on the CD sleeves. These albums are Joni Mitchell's best!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly's &#34;Harry Bosch&#34; novels are first-rate. They are required reading for anyone looking for entertainment on the written page. Much more satisfying than any of the top-rated television fictional crime programs. Connelly's real-life experience as a newspaper crime reporter shows through his writing, and he is a master at using the English language in the vernacular. What Poe started, Connelly has taken to the pinnacle.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|First, I enjoyed the overall first episode. Second, I barely made it through the opening minutes. When I realized this was going to be a &#34;Jumping the shark&#34; episodic amalgamated psychic, police procedural, supernatural mystery-thriller-pulp drama, then I settled in. The acting is pretty much standard TV fare. Writing does not do justice to the subject but does maintain &#34;entertainment&#34; level suspense.
0425252868|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of the best books about WWII I have read.  I can usually go from one book to anther without a problem, but this one left me thinking about how, in spite of all the hatred and malice that went on during that war, there was still a time for compassion for a fellow human being.  I saw the video of the 2 men getting together after the war and it was obvious that when it all comes down to it, we can be compassinate to each other.  It was certainly a very different take than most stories re WWII and I feel it would be a great movie.  Steven Speilberg, Tom Hanks, where are you???
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I loved this because it came earlier than it was scheduled to and the dvd's alway's work and are in great condision.
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|The quirky, eclectic hip-hop sound of \\"Night Train\\" is very different from the somber, sweeping piano-based style that put Keane on the map, and I can understand how fans of the familiar classic sound might find this EP somewhat jarring at first. However, as it has been triumphantly proven by \\"Strangeland\\" that they can still make excellent music in their traditional style, I think that everyone should take themselves a little less seriously and give \\"Night Train\\" another chance. This album is fun and interesting without sacrificing the basic qualities that make Keane so good, and frankly, I'm grateful that they are willing to experiment and push themselves to be innovative and original.
B00127RAJY|5.0|good video, explains how anyone can understand and goes step by step. I love it! worry that consumers enjoy while exercising. arrived on time and in excellent condition

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have been looking for an app like this ever since I got my Kindle Fire. It has absolutely everything you can think of and even things you never thought of. Timer, sounds and music which can be combined plus a favorites capability.  Good for sleeping, relaxing, yoga and meditation. Amazing. Look no further.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Turns out it's okay to be an introvert, but we needed Susan Cain's permission first.  Instead of feeling like we are missing a key ingredient to success, we introverts are told by Cain how to manage our personalities to greatest effect, recognize and prepare for when we will be outside our comfort zone and allow time to recharge.  She also demystifies the extroverts who way too often bowl us over and intimidate us, as it turns out, unwittingly.  I see my workplace and relationships in an entirely new light as a result of this book.
B0082EOJYE|5.0|This movie stayed in the old silent movie story line. The charters will have you rutting for them and the acting was great!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can spend time and get lost in the search of an ideal.  Love the recipes, decorating ideas, outdoor spaces and humor.
B000FA675C|2.0|I am not Roman Catholic but I find this novel an insult to Roman Catholics and all Christians.  Especially for the poorly informed and those on the fringe of theological discourse, this novel may justify hostility and smear campaigns over the Christian faith and Jesus.  I read it after it seemed everyone else had read it.  If &#34;novels&#34; like this are justified as free speech and free press, then no wonder the art world also attacks Christian faith and symbols.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is a really good show.  There is a little over acting, and some lingering shots to emphasize people's emotions and add to the drama.  This isn't a detractor, just something I've noticed.
B00932A3SK|5.0|fast paced and different with a good twist at the end. The relationship with his wife was crazy and confusing in a good way because it kept you guessing!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is beautifully done. It is so well crafted that it reminds me of the old hand-done Disney films. The story is wonderful as well. It is not one where you know how it is going to proceed or end. It is healthy, ethically sound, positive, fun,and uplifting. It is in the tradition of ancient story telling where a pattern is presented for healthy successful life choices and illustrated by example. It is one I would gladly give to my children and watch several times myself. I love the Pixar films. They have outdone themselves with this one.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Love this watch and would highly recommend it for a nice everyday time piece...........Glad I disregarded some of the negative comments....it keeps time as well as any other watch I have in this price range.................

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have had this app for several months. It gives a very good visual display of remaining battery charge and how much time this level of charge will last during normal usage.
B009X011UQ|5.0|The shell has protected my tablet from a spill, and from a broken pen. Does the job it is supposed to.
B005LAII12|1.0|The plot is about a man, his talking teddy bear, and his girlfriend.  Things go bad, then get better.  Things get worse, then get better.  Things go really bad, then they all live happily ever after.  Two hours was way too long for this plot, so there was a lot of slow-moving filler.<br /><br />It's supposed to be a comedy, but not much was funny.  Way too much cussing, teddy bear sex, and gratuitous violence.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature was Mila Kunis, who was a wonderful girlfriend in the movie, and wonderful actress.

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|love the show but the picture can be blurry at times. I can't wait for each new episode. Thank-you very much
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|Clutch fans will not be dissapointed. This album is not as bluesy as the last few records. It comes across as a straight ahead rocker true to it's name.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Neat game. So easy and play my toddler can play it! Its definitely one of the best free games. And you can still enjoy it with or without ridiculous microtransactions! It's fun in the day or night time!

B00BUAEYVK|2.0|Saw Die Hard 5 at the Discount Theater today, and I'm glad I didn't spend more on it.  I almost fell asleep twice during it, the shortest film in the franchise (only 97 minutes).  It definitely was not a good day, or a good movie, for Die Hard fans when this 93 million dollar behemoth screened.  John McClane should have died 10 times, but only got a scratch. Didn't even bother to limp or breathe hard either. Bad Acting, worse script, choppy editing, and even worse disbelief in reality made me glad I didn't spend 15 bucks on it. But I still spent $3, and I feel like I paid too much.  Bruce Willis let me down.  Was it supposed to be a comedy about how bad one can make a Die Hard movie?  Pro: Sound Editing/Mixing.  1.7/5 Stars.  I don't want to see it again without the guys from MST3K doing a funny voice-over.  ~Keep On
0071752854|5.0|Oren has the unique ability to describe complex ideas and concepts in a way that is both useful  and particularly easy to understand.  The idea of 'sales' has been around as long as there has been commerce.  Being great at the art of selling, without being particularly smarmy and disingenuous, is difficult.  Using the tools and process that Oren presents makes pitching virtually any idea much easier.<br /><br />A great read for most anyone in a sales position.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Interesting concept....  ending missed the mark.  The pictures are interesting and genuine which made them that much more interesting.  I needed more details.
030758836X|4.0|Often times, the dual narration of protagonists in the first person perspective can be garbled and confusing, but I found that in this particular novel it worked profoundly well.  It puts you into the minds of both Nick and Amy Dunne and takes you through the workings of a highly dysfunctional marriage arrangement.<br /><br />I found this novel to be incredibly engaging, and I think the choice of using two protagonists to tell the story was a good choice by the author.  If this work had been written in third person, it may have become to obvious what the truth of the matter regarding Amy's disappearance was in the storyline.  I say this without trying to give too much of the story's meat or the ending away.<br /><br />Highly recommended read.  I just pulled this one off the library shelf randomly, with no regrets.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|I'm a huge Porcupine Tree fan and came across Riverside about 18 months ago.  I have since purchased several albums with Rapid Eye Movement being my favorite....until I got S.O.N.G.S.  This album is so good - I hear a lot of 70's prog rock influence here - Genesis, Kansas, Tull - some catchy grooves, but with the modern feel, excellent production, and hard edge that Riverside brings - for my taste this is the perfect combination.  I've been listening to this over and over - can't get enough.  Even my 14 yr old son is diggin it.  This is a must have for Riverside fans.  I'm bummed they are not hitting the West Coast as part of their US tour.

B009FZHYKU|3.0|I love the show but watching it on Amazon has been a pain in the butt.  The show is not released till the next day and then when we are finally able to watch the show it constantly freezes on us and takes forever to unfreeze.  So frustrating!  This happens several times for each episode that we have paid for.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Very good book, but not what I expected!  I did not like the flaws of the main character.  The book would have been just as good without her being so weird!
B002H5JHUA|4.0|This movie starts with a bang, and never let up. The continuity scenes, shot in black and white, tie this film into the with classic Universal horror movies. It is set just after the end of the Universal \\"Frankenstein\\".<br /><br />The interlude scene with Mr. Hyde was interesting. Comparing the fight scenes with the CGI used for the Hulk and Jabba the Hut in Star Wars shows just how far the technology and acting has come in the past twenty years.<br /><br />Creature design for the Frankenstein Monster was well thought out, with just enough of a nod to Karloff's body dynamics and voice as the Frankenstein monster to keep it recognizable. The CGI and makeup for Adam (The monster) has clear descent from Jack Pierce's design, (which was based on early 20th century anatomy), was enhanced nicely by the four section glowing, crackling skull and lightning effects, which were also present in the monster's heart.<br /><br />When asked what he wanted the simple response- \\"To Exist!\\" was brilliant! No need for anything else.<br /><br />Wisely, the studio didn't try to imitate Lugosi's Dracula. The visual transformations were beautiful, though I didn't find this Dracula as creepy as the Lugosi portrayal. This Dracula is certainly as evil as any other on screen, but he is a complex being, driven but lacking in some basic human emotions-providing a nice development that I hope Universal will pick up on in another movie down the line.<br /><br />The brides of Dracula were well-designed, the actresses beautiful, and were believable as the undead brides who are immortal, bereft of higher reasoning faculties, cruel, devoted and more than a little terrified of their master.<br /><br />Lon Chaney Sr., the first choice to play Dracula in the 1930's for Universal,  had an on-screen homage in the makeup and visage of the village Undertaker. This character and his clothing is clearly based on Chaney's makeup in \\"London After Midnight\\", an unfortunately lost silent movie.<br /><br />Van Helsing's side kick provided just the right amount of humor to break up some of the scenes.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman does a good if not outstanding job as a driven monster hunter unaware of most of his past. One can only wonder what sort of sins warranted a memory wipe as part of his penance.  How did he come to be taken in by this Brotherhood of Monster Hunters?<br /><br />The werewolves were different from those in other Universal Pictures, \\"The Howling\\" series or \\"Underworld\\". Each new generation of CGI and makeup provides us with fuzzier- and much bigger-werewolves. Designers might consider dropping the dog as a template for this creature and use an extinct bear-dog or similar canid that was bigger and scarier than a wolf.The werewolves simply did not move in a believable manner.<br /><br />The scene of death by artificial sunlight in Dracula's Palace was interesting, if lifted from a Quentin Tarantino movie some years back, where the vampires were killed by sunlight reflecting off of a disco ball.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsdale was stunning as an acrobatic gypsy trying to save generations of her family from their badly conceived (in my opinion) bargain with the Church. It was never clear what her plan was for killing Dracula, as she knew that everything in her arsenal was ineffectual.<br /><br />In all, a good movie. Not a spectacular box office success, but I do hope in a few years for a sequel or prequel built around Gabriel.
B003B02O7I|5.0|One of the best of Grisham. I couldn't put it down! From the beginning it keeps you hooked. It will grip you and keep you reading. His rich detail about geographical areas are surperbly interesting. The illness of not only the areas of the characters but the main character himself was something I studied in college. You can't go wrong buying this book! I read it in paperback years ago and ordered it again. Any<br />fans of this author should buy it. You won't regret it.  Sharon Warner. warner.sherry@Yahoo.com

B0052AC8C6|5.0|Good old fashioned entertainment for the whole family, or anyone who has a dream! Touting upstanding values and morals, while giving a sequence of.events that makes this a very entertaining animation.
B004FHCH96|5.0|I've seen over a thousand films, and this is my favourite of all time.  Why?  Unique concept (wow, really? how often can you say that??), crisp direction, emotional story, thrilling plot, characters you care about even though you're never really sure if they're 'good' or 'bad', terrific acting, and the best direction.  How can something so backward be so progressive?  Not a feel-good movie, not a blockbuster, not sexy, but makes you think and care and wonder and beam.  I'm happy Nolan went on to such acclaim, but nothing he's done since is 'better' than this diminutive masterpiece.

6305127646|5.0|The first half is quality high tech International espionage with degrees of engaging characterization. It's solid, fun, kinetic, and a blast.  The best part is how dated everything is. Flip cell phones straight from 1997, and you've got the ill-fated electronica score of the mid-90s guiding you through Kilmer's cleft chin exploits.<br /><br />The second half is where it stumbles. Originally, the director wanted a wicked awesome sword fight climax that required Emma to die early on in the film. Test audiences being test audiences abhorred the downer, and requested a happy, stupid ending (hence why there's three, or four false flag codas a la Lifetime movies.) It breaks my heart what the studios did to the end. Emma should've been killed off to propel Kilmer's character further. It would've made the last narration by Roger Moore, and Templar's contribution of the cold fusion formula much more potent. Instead, we get a dopey ending.<br /><br />So what you have is the strangest chick flick of all-time. It's an action-adventure chick flick buoyed by Val Kilmer's charisma, and bad Russian accents.The movie is solid, and one of my favorites for what it is. Five stars. Six when we get the Director's Cut.
0793518326|5.0|The music notes and scores are very small and the book is heavy, but it includes all of the Beatles songs. I got this book intending to play the music. I'm not sure i will be able to use it as a song book for the piano.
B00CB4FHNI|5.0|This should really be album of the year. Start to finish this album is full of different elements that might remind you of a plethora of other incredible bands.

B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|This show is intriguing, disturbing, and everything a good ghost story should be. The acting is good, and Jessica Lange is outstanding.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give the show 5 stars was the flawed captions on the streaming version. I'm in a noisy house, and I'm lucky if I can catch every single line. It seemed that every time someone in the other room was talking loudly or slamming doors, I'd miss a crucial line. The captioning missed the line as well. I ended up switching to another streaming service a few episodes in, only because the captions were much more reliable.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|This film didn't come to the big screen in my town. I was glad to find it on Amazon. Now i can watch it again and again. I've seen some of the Cirque shows live in Las Vegas. They are always good. In film they can do even more with special effects.

B006VFLIYK|3.0|Great character and plot development. Tells a great story but the endings were very weak, not creditable and feels compelled to tie up loose ends even though the main character lives to go on into next book.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Occational good scenes throughout but the acting was too predictable.  My evaluation was complete at the end of the one sentence but it would not accept that as an answer.

0780747550|5.0|The best book I've read this year. If Neil Simon were to have written a novel it may have well looked like this book. A unique voice and style applying humor in all of the right ways for a reader to absorb the sad tragedy of growing up poor, Irish, and Catholic during the depression years, in America, and Ireland. Frank McCourt is able to overcome the pathos of his poignant, sad, and often disturbing memoir of growing up as the oldest son of a poor Irish Catholic family, through use of voice. In Angela’s Ashes, Frank McCourt presents his memoir though the limited first person view of a young boy. He creates comic relief in using the voice of a small child, as he grows up, first in New York, and then in Limerick, Ireland, during the time of the depression, and its aftermath. McCourt presents a tragic account of his family that would generally overwhelm any reader, unless presented through the eyes of a child, who often does not realize the hardship he has undergone, and whose innocent, limited view allows him (and the reader) to keep going. McCourt pushes the reader through the grief of near starvation, the upbringing by an alcoholic father, misguided mother, loss of younger siblings, and the stigma of growing up, poor, Irish, and Catholic, at a time when all three were considered an affliction, like some disease, rather than circumstance. He manages to hold the reader’s interest, without overwhelming her with pathos, by his character’s youthful voice, through artful dialogue, carefully crafted to allow the reader to see the lighter side of his tragic life.  His choice of colloquial terms of endearment unique to the Irish of this era, calling his mother “Mam” instead of mom and using “Och” at the start of dialogue summary of the characters who likely had an Irish accent. In the very first paragraph, the author lets the voice of the narrator, pick up the easy ebb and flow of the Irish manner of speaking, and use of the vernacular of an American Irish immigrant, to recall his humble beginnings.  “My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland, when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.” (McCourt, 11).  The reader can almost picture an Irishman speaking as the story begins. McCort introduces comedy into his narrative voice, an older, more mature, man looking back on his life, when he recalls his father:<br />Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County, Antrim.<br />Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the<br />Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he<br />wound up a fugitive with a price on his head. [] When I was a child I would<br />look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why<br />anyone would give money for a head like that. (McCourt, 12)<br />This establishes the comic tone of the story through the voice of the character, recalling through his inner thoughts as a child, later through narrative summary, what he was told by his grandmother when he was thirteen; “as a wee lad, your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.” (McCourt, 12). This revelation becomes more humorous when the reader reconciles it with the story of how the grandmother’s brother, Patrick “Ab” Sheean, became retarded, after his alcoholic father dropped him on his head, when he was a baby. (McCourt, 13).<br /> Living with an alcoholic father, even one that is not necessarily abusive, can be a rather difficult subject matter for any reader to plow through, particularly where his alcoholism leave the family so impoverished that his family is near starvation, while he spends what little money on ale however, McCourt’s use of a limitedfirst person view through a child’s eyes, the reader is given an account that is both tolerable, and sometimes funny. Here the voice of the child character portrays the tragic account of life in an impoverished alcoholic family with both catharsis, and humor. He uses word choices indicative of an Irish child, and through creative use of point of view, and method of speaking like a child, he says:<br /><br />  When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings,<br />  Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,<br />  It had to be and the reason is this<br />  Could it be true, that someone like you<br />  Could love me, love me?<br /><br />When Dad brings home the first weeks wages, Mam is delighted, she can pay the lovely<br />Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there’s nothing<br /> worse in the world than to owe and be beholding to anyone. She cleans … she buys … and …<br />on Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. …  Mam will boil the water on the stove<br /> and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his<br />behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we’ll all laugh …(but) when Dad’s job<br />goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages… we know Mam won’t<br />sing anymore one can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table<br />talking to herself… and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley.<br />[By the fourth week] Dad loses his job…(McCourt, 23-28).<br />When his new baby sister, Margaret, dies, and his mother shuts down and stares at the wall, the use of a child’s voice enables the reader to somehow cope with the description of neglect of the other small children living in a roach infested apartment, with no food, and having to fend for themselves while their alcoholic father is still out at the pub. Later, when Oliver, one of the twins dies of pneumonia, followed by his brother, Eugene, McCourt’s use of his child’s voice, delivering death of his brothers, and baby sister Margaret into that child’s view that is both tolerable, and hopeful, despite the tears it brings to the reader’s eyes.<br />  Malachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he’s<br />not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he’s not there<br />anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he’s<br />far from the Shannon (River) dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with<br />Oliver and Margret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no<br />aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home the money from the Labour<br />Exchange and you don’t have to be running around to pubs to find them. (McCourt, 90).<br />By using comic relief, McCourt is able to keep the reader from being too overwhelmed with pathos for the despair that so many tragic events, death, starvation, alcoholism, poverty and the disdain of insensitive people. He delivers the relief in the familiar family situations that bring smiles, along with the tears. Like when the mischievous brothers climb downstairs when their parents are sleeping and try on the false teeth that sit on the shelf by the sink, and Malachy is unable to remove his father’s big teeth from his mouth and has to go to the hospital. Although a near tragic event, McCourt is able to find the humor in the situation, and relay it to the reader in a believable child’s voice, telling the story.<br /> McCort’s portrayal of the family living upstairs in a house where they are unable to live downstairs because of the overwhelming odor from the sewage of many other families which is dumped near their front door, although not funny, is made humorous where the inspectors for the Saint Vincent De Paul Society are told by Malachy, still a child, that his family lives in “Italy” a term they have dubbed the upstairs part of the house where they live. (McCourt, 104).<br />Additionally, when the grandmother stops talking to, and supporting the family, the tragic effect of this fact is reduced when the reason is provided in an anecdote where the main character reveals it was because he puked up God in her backyard after he came home from his first communion, (McCourt, 129), and where he had “God stuck to the roof of (his) mouth.” (McCourt, 128). The reader is compelled to laugh at the thoughts of a child, over a potentially touchy situation that interferes with the grandmother’s faith, and causes a serious rift in the family.<br /> Even when the main character’s mother lies dying, and he and his brothers are brought to their aunt’s house, McCourt creates a moment of levity to relive the reader of her heavy heart when he hears his fat aunt in the other room tinkling, and he is afraid to tell his brothers because he thinks they will all break out laughing: “at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie’s big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot.” (McCourt, 242). Later, when he delivers a message to an Englishman, is dragged into the house, forced to drink sherry and ends up puking on the rose bush belonging to the man’s wife, and is later dismissed from his job, where he is saving to go to America, the reader is spared the severe disappointment by the humor in the story, and a voice that keeps comic relief in everything it describes. (McCourt, 328-329). The book ends on a note of hilarity where the main character, on his way to America, is about to have sex, and a priest comes to his door. “The bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you’d never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest …” Despite all of his suffering, McCourt is as entertaining as his is hilarious. He has an enviable voice, Angela’s Ashes is a tribute to any mother’s memory.<br /> #<br /><br />__________________<br />McCourt, Frank. Angela’s Ashes. Scribner.

B0000524CY|5.0|This movie will get into you. My mom told me she saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theater back in the 70's when she was still single. She said it was one of the chilling and scariest movie she ever saw. No doubt about it. Linda Blair did a great job portraying the role.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|After always been carrying a big bulky camera bag around when I don't need it, this is great. I have a 650D with kit lens and a 50mm prime lens which fits the bag perfectly. I can separate my charge from the cable and put both of them in my side pockets and my memory cards etc. in a small zipped pocket inside the bad. It's perfect.
0920236251|1.0|The book is so small it is hard to read.  The description did not make it clear that this book was not the normal size.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|The history of an important piece of Rock and Roll and the preservation methods taken by musical genious, Dave Grohl, to keep the music I grew up on and love alive!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoyed the personal touch provided by the authors.  The reality of war and the need to remain human in the face of brutality.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My college-aged son recommended this book to me.  All I can say is it deeply affected me. The literary style in writing, the quotes and deep metaphorical meaning in the words...the beautiful relationship between Gus and hazel and the fact they were able to share intellect and love and small things through their short time together. Tears often would fall upon reading...I loved their dinner in Amsterdam and their union that they were able to share which all should be blessed to with one they love.  The unabashed enthusiasm of Gus and the way he saw things was wonderful.  A great read.  The fault in our stars is a book worth reading.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone.  I am replacing all my Disney movies that I lost moving and love it.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Picked up the set my mistake. Only wanted to see what the buzz was about, then couldn't  put it down. Actually panicked when the rental expired  Good details, in depth emotions revealed  Has you on the edge of your seat
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I have most of his books.  I can not put it down so I lose alot of sleep as I need to know what happens next.<br />There is always a surprise. in his writing.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I think this was a great book. It was Veary adventureous. It has a little bit of cheese in some of the fighting parts. This book would be best if an 8th greater or above we're going read it.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I really Don't like science fiction but I had to read this book for school. It was very dry until the end where spoiler alert It's not a game but even after that it's boring. But that's my opinion and I hate science fiction.
B0024CEY36|4.0|I enjoyed the book a great deal. Not his best work but as usual he sucks you in very quickly...
B005OT2YVA|3.0|The other movies were better and more intense than this one. A little less over-acting and more of a story line and it would good like the rest.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|It took me quite a few listens for this album to grow on me, but I am convinced this is their BEST album ever, forget moving pictures, hemispheres, you name it. The music is varied, the sound is crisp and amazing, the songwriting superb both musically and lyrically. What I enjoy about this one ore than their later Clockwork Angels is the lyrics. Really personal and meaningful, not a fantastic world like 2112 or Clockwork Angels. I highly recomend it, give it a try, give it 10, I canöt listen to anything else now for 3 weeks, I am HOOKED!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have read and watched the movies so many time I've lost count and each time I watch them again I see something I missed the last time I watched them.<br />Hate to see them end would like to see more.
B0091REZMW|5.0|So totally hooked on this game. i get a little impatient sometimes waiting for energy to reload but that's the only way I can stop playing. :)
B008602KQI|5.0|The best part of the movie is guessing what was going to happen next, which was pretty much at every scene.
B0084670FU|3.0|Too many plots and subplots going on.  Have to ask yourself could this really happen? It seemed contrived and not much of a story line.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|GREAT MOVIE<br />loved the movie... have watched it several times, the special effects are amazing.<br />Would highly recommend it to anyone that loves movies.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|this movie holds you attention from beginning to end! It will not disappoint.  Sally Fields was great.  Sit back and enjoy!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great read you will laugh out loud and never look at food the,same way ever again.  Also a quick read
B0055OK2T0|2.0|It's not a winner.  Likeable characters and the actors are competent.  But the movie isn't engaging and thankfully isn't longer.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I LIKE the different clocks you can choose, really cool. The fact that you can wake up to music that you choose makes it even cooler.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I have seen contests on the internet to pick the &#34;best&#34; bad man. Dicaprio wins hands down. What an explosive performance. Mr. Foxx is a real fox in this movie. Excellent  performance. I am not familiar with Mr. Waltz but he too is excellent. Great acting.<br /><br />These men made this movie and of course the direction of Mr. Tarantino - a blockbuster.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel, has the talent to play any character of any movie and make it work, on this one he was terrific as usual, very good plot
B004GHNIRK|1.0|This was the most depressing novel I've ever read.  I've read a lot of classics and enjoyed them all until this one.  A major chore to read.  If I could give it no stars, I would.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I have all of Volbeat's albums. this is record is true to what got them to where they are today. I don't like long reviews so I will keep it short. All volbeat's stuff is great. if you like all kinds of music: metal, country music, and old '50 style music. Volbeat is for YOU!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is actually really awesome. There is always something new to do! The hardest part is waiting for your energy to restore so you can play more.
B00004XPPC|4.0|this was bought for my boyfriend...I have not yet seen it ut he has and enjoys it so no complaints!
B002KGEORM|5.0|I started watching this cause Katey Sagal is in it. She is great.  The way the characters are progressing is amazing.  Keep up the great work Mr. Sutter!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The story, characters and cinematography are beautiful to watch. It can be a bit gorey, but it was brutal and gorey back then. &#34;Vikings&#34;.<br /><br />I'm looking forward this story continuing for a long while:)
B00BDSRMIQ|5.0|5 stars... it would be silly to expect anything better than this!  Watched the dvd in one sitting... with my girlfriend... we were both mesmerized!<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Iced Earth, they're probably my favorite band.  That may lead you to believe this will be a biased review; however, often times the biggest fans are also the harshest critics.  To build credibility, here's a few criticisms I have toward Iced Earth:<br />* \\"Framing Armageddon\\" & \\"Crucible of Man\\"... I've picked about 5 songs between the 2 albums that I really enjoy, the rest are pretty much boring/filler to me.<br />* I liked Barlow the 1st time around, buy why get rid of Ripper to bring back a \\"part-time\\" Barlow?<br />* \\"Festivals of the Wicked\\" - why release 2 shows from the same summer festival tour?  The 2 Barlow shows have virtually the same setlist.<br /><br />But for \\"Live in Ancient Kourion\\" ... Iced Earth has nailed it!  As Jon states in one of the interviews, the setlist will never please everyone.  It's cool he acknowledged that.  He followed that up with his idea to release live material for each of the future tour cycles, each including many different songs from their back catalogue.  To me, that sounds like a great response to the setlist conundrum.<br /><br />Seeing them in concert on the Dystopia tour helped me to fully embrace Stu.  He's great with the crowd, but more importantly, he's a terrific singer.  This live album should give that same opportunity to the fans whom have not seen Iced Earth live with Stu.  He sings low & high, & everywhere in between.  Only negative observation I have thus far with Stu is his over-the-top performance of \\"Dracula\\" on \\"Live in Ancient Kourion.\\"  It's impressive to hear him switch from low to high so often, so quickly... but it sorta detracts from the song, changes it from an emotional masterpiece, into a vocal lesson/demonstration.  Although apart from Dracula, upon 1st listen, every other song on here was done brilliantly.  With these new live versions, I will have a hard time choosing my favorite version of many of these songs... I look forward to the challenge.<br /><br />I'm also looking forward to many powerful years of output from Iced Earth with Stu on vocals.  This album is great for anyone wanting to see how Stu fits into the Iced Earth fold, it's great for people just starting out with Iced Earth, & most importantly, it's just a great live album, period.
B00796E7CA|5.0|This by far the best book that links the Silmarrillion with the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings..A must read for all fans of Tolkien.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Classy, television at its best! The acting, story were riveting. Can't wait to see season 4 and I am anxiously awaiting
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This is a nighttime soap opera with a bit of historical fiction.  Beautiful costumes and scenes from a English castle.
1905236042|5.0|Monkey see, monkey do! My kids loved watching their cousins do these poses and I wanted to find something calming as well. The poses were easy to do, the pictures were large enough to see and imitate without having to read the text and the variety of poses is ample. A great product!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has an incredible, twisting plot and amazing effects. You never really know what's going to happen next. After watching it for so long, you start to think of yourself as part of the group of main characters and everything they do affects you personally.
1400052181|4.0|Did a great job of mixing science and story.  The author was incredibly sympathetic and made sure that we really got what the family had experienced as a result of the medical community's actions.  I highly recommend this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Why I like it:<br />•New Adventure<br />•Better Graphics<br />•Choices of Heros<br />•Addicting<br />•Free!<br />•Daily Quest<br />•MULTIPLAYER<br /><br />What it need to get 5 stars:<br />• More chances to get glu coins<br />• Another Female hero ( one that don't cost you glu coins)<br />• More chances to get charms
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you've not caught up on The Walking Dead, or if you've never seen it... it's a must-see! One of the best things on Television.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Had me on pins and needles! Smartly written and action packed. I couldn't put this book down until it was finished!
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|it is fun and very active you should try it and if you don't like it you can get red of it very easliy you should at lease give it a chance.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|I really enjoy action movies and this one didn't disappoint me. It also had mystery mixed into the plot along with the great action scenes. I'll watch this movie over and over!
B002NN5F7A|2.0|It didn't seem like there was even a plot to this movie!  All I could hear was F - F - F!!!  So many good stars were playing in the movie - I was just very disappointed!!!
B0041CGP02|4.0|Both as an entertainer and human Jon Bon Jovi excels. This particular collection met my expectations but did not exceed them.
B008P9M614|5.0|This is the perfect item I have choosen to get for myself. I am glad that I chose with seller to get it from. It has no scratches, no broken discs and it came in the original package. I love watching House and I am glad I got this to get all caught up on this series I have always wanted to watch but did not have the time to watch it. Now, I can watch it anytime I want.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Protects my Kindle, looks sharp, and makes using the Kindle easier with the stand mode.  I'm very happy with my purchase, especially at the sale price.
B009NXAMW6|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  All of the actors did an excellent job - and the ending was quite a surprise!
B003WUYP56|5.0|Just got the Kindle edition last night and read the excellent introduction. I will assign five stars for now and try to update as I read more. I am a lay person wrt physics but my interest lies more in the philosophy of science and what appears to me to be non-scientific behavior by scientists.  Here's a current example of why I feel this book is relevant:<br /><br />April 18, 2013 headline from article on Space.com, about an address given by Stephen Hawking on April 16 at Caltech:<br /><br />\\"Big Bang didn't need God, Stephen Hawking says.\\"<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />\\"He [Hawking] closed by outlining \\"M-theory,\\" which is based partly on ideas put forward years ago by another famed physicist, Caltech's Richard Feynman. Hawking sees that theory as the only big idea that really explains what he has observed.<br /><br />M-theory posits that multiple universes are created out of nothing, Hawking explained, with many possible histories and many possible states of existence. In only a few of these states would life be possible, and in fewer still could something like humanity exist. Hawking mentioned that he felt fortunate to be living in this state of existence.\\"<br /><br />As a side note, the following comment about God is attributed to Hawking in the article:<br /><br />\\"He noted that many people still seek a divine solution to counter the theories of curious physicists, and at one point, he quipped, 'What was God doing before the divine creation? Was he preparing hell for people who asked such questions?'\\"<br /><br />So I gather that Hawking thinks that people who believe (an unknown number of) universes just popped out of nothing are educated while those who believe that the existence of a natural universe with a finite age requires someone or something that is outside of nature are dolts. Scientists are going to have to do better than this if they don't just want to preach to their own choirs at places like Cal-Tech.<br /><br />I look forward to the rest of this book.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|I have to say that this movie is different in all of its aspects of possession movies out there. Glad that I got this movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very good book, highly recomend to anyone especially if you are technically inclined or interested in engineering or space.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook!  I don't like some of the changes that they've made, tho.  But the fact that I can write one note and post it, without having to send individual notes to people, is SO awesome!!  I wish that all of my friends and family would join!!
B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic. The movie pace , and for some reason the volume, increases as you move into the movie. So glad we ordered it to watch at home. This is one of those movies that it helps to be able to reverse and replay some sections.
0140544518|5.0|I have used this book to teach 2nd grade, 4th/5th grade and even middle school.  The kids love the non-traditional take on the fairy tale.  I use it to teach perspective and how situations appear different to different people.  The kids love the humor and I love that they are engaged.  My own kids (ages 10, 12 and 13) all love the book too!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I hadn't heard of them before and was very surprised by their music.  It's very entertaining and love it on my ipod when I do my walking also...I always have it on in my car too......
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Shipped in a timely manner.  One of Paul Simon's best works and I'm glad I ordered the CD.  You don't want to miss the lyrics or the liner notes!
B007REV4YI|2.0|Yawn. Nothing new, nothing interesting, so many flaws and improbabilities. I have liked most of the Bond movies before. This one, not so much. Oh, sorry, did I fall asleep?
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Read this with my 9 year old daughter. We both loved it. Rightfully considered a classic. I'm looking forward to reading it again with my 6 year old in a few years.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|My husband loved this, personally I though the language was a bit much but a funny movie none the less.<br /><br />Overall I will still recommend this product.
B0039RY3MM|2.0|The product worked fine, what I got out of it, half the tube on the inside next to the plunger, was a hard, crumbly, grey material, there was only enough product to do one cpu. For the price, I thought it was a ripoff. Though, this was not sidewinder computers fault but the manufacturer.
B00005JPMZ|2.0|Two separate ratings would be more helpful.  The movie is cute.  My kids love it.  The DVD came with many scratches.  So many that two of my players couldn't play it without super-annoying skipping and crying frustrated children.  Put it through my Skip-Dr and it is now tolerable but certainly not of &#34;new&#34; quality as was expected. Overall disappointed.  The price paid does not warrant paying for a return so we are stuck with it.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Iain M. Banks deserves the Nobel Prize for Imagination.<br /><br />Absolutely stunned by the news. He gave me my first SF reads after losing interest in the genre decades ago.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Another good Richard Gere movie what can.  Loyalty of a man's best-friend.  It brought tears to my eyes.  I would recommend this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is absolutely amazing you should definitely buy it you can buy lots of different characters to play with and hover boards.
1455113549|5.0|This novel got my interest just from it's description, a father, who is a lawyer, defending his own son for murder, what could be more intriguing?  It not only met my expectations, but exceeded them.  The story just draws you in from the very beginning, and you can't wait to see how it continues to unfold.  I listen to the audio CD's while I ride my bike, and to say I put on more mileage then usual is an understatement, as I am curious to find out what happens next.  I recommend this novel very highly, and have ordered more books by the author William Landay as well.
076781326X|4.0|I saw it when it first came to the theaters and still like watching it and singing along with the songs -- wonderful songs, even though the message behind the songs isn't entirely wholesome. This is a GP movie without vulgar language or sex.... when this movie came out such things were more implied than overt (I prefer it that way). The story like does take place in the London of Dickens era. And like many of his books, there is a darkness - which in this musical seem much less dark than the current Disney Movies (Alice in Wonderland or The Christmas Carol - neither of which I like). I don't think many of today's children could identify nor believe that there existed a time when 'Please Sir, I want some More' or 'You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two' were a way of life.. Most kids don't know that much social history in England to understand the seriousness. So, this could be an enjoyable history/reality lesson in life.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Bought this one for my husband he has the other Underworld movies.  Movie got to us in a reasonable amount of time great quality.  I would recommend this dvd.
0486237664|5.0|Anyone wanting to draw animals and looking for a reference book couldn't do much better than this book.  The fact that the illustrations are black and white makes it easier to differentiate lines.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Its very easy to use and incorporates all cities in the world. I don't need to watch the local weather anymore. Thank you Kindle!!!#!!
B0042U94UQ|3.0|I think I'm from the wrong generations to enjoy most of the Pixar movies. The story lines don't seem to be appropriate nor do they show good examples for children (especially referring to Despicable Me, and UP). I liked The Incredables and Toy Story & 2 but those are fun playful movies all ages can enjoy. Despicable Me seems to promote bad behavior and is what I call, a 'Gimmick' movie like the type only made to sell toys or other items. I didn't particularly like it but I know my granddaughters (ages 7 & 12 thought it was funny). Of course, with the types of cartoons on Saturday morning these days, I don't think this new generation has much seen good wholesome humor.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The first half reads like a romantic comedy, with many laugh out loud moments, and then ish gets real dark and twisted. Don't be surprised if you she's a few tears.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Alliterative quirks and all, I enjoyed reading this. I have watched the Showtime series from the beginning but had never read the books inspiring the show before. There were some surprises (and, I admit, some disappointments) but it was a good opportunity to get another take on this handsome, sinister larger-than-life character.
1594744769|5.0|I'm glad I now can check another book off my reading list! I've been wanting to read this book for a while and I'm glad with how quickly it came in the mail! I hope to enjoy it!
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|I  had seen most of the X-men on TV but it seemed to take forever until this one made it to TV. I couldn't wait so I bought it from Amazon for less than the cost of going to the movies, getting a soda and popcorn. Best of all, I could watch it in my home. Not knowing the story behind Wolverine, other than he was my son's favorite, I wasn't sure what to expect. It is a good movie but I didn't expect the brother nor the machinations behind the creation of Wolverine. Sometimes I wonder if I was better off not knowing. Good movie but I don't like it as much as the First X-Men movie or Captain America.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I've been looking forward to reading Sandberg's book since seeing her TEDTalk and reading a few of her other interviews and articles on the subject. The book was everything I had hoped for too -- not just her autobiography or saying how perfectly she has managed the ups and downs of working as a woman in a male-dominated tech industry, but actually seeing her raw honesty about how she has failed before, and more importantly how she picked herself back up. Being a Barnard Alumna, it was also inspiring to hear about President Deb Spar and Carrie Weber (who was one of my French professors, and Sandberg's Harvard roommate). Being only a few years into my own career and recently married, I found this to be very useful to start having the conversations with my husband about how we will manage both our careers once we have kids. I've always known I will continue my career after having children, and reading Sandberg's book made me feel like it was all within my grasp -- I just have to put in the effort and be okay with my decisions. For me, the most valuable lesson was that there is no perfect recipe, no steps you can follow and life will be perfect, nothing like that at all. The lesson is to be okay with your decisions and that you can always reset the rules with your partner to make the best of your situation.<br /><br />I'm going to be sending this to all of my colleagues to read -- I'm confident that my generation won't be labeled as &#34;female C-level executives&#34;, just simply &#34;C-level executives.&#34;
055380684X|1.0|Daniel Coyle's The Talent Code comes so close to an outrageous parody of every self-help book you've ever read that it is easy to be dazzled by the chutzpah of is author and to overlook the shoddiness of its logic.<br /><br />A nature-or-nurture debate has continued since Victorian times over the importance of innate qualities (nature) versus personal experiences (nurture) in determining an individual's success. Coyle weighs in on the side of nurture. \\"Greatness isn't born, it's grown\\", he tells us. How greatness is grown depends on an understanding of a \\"talent code\\" that is \\"built on revolutionary scientific discoveries\\" (p. 5)<br /><br />Coyle supports his argument with the evidence of nine \\"chicken-wire Harvards\\" (p. 11), \\"talent hotbeds\\" (p. 14) of greatness in different fields. For, though \\"these places shared nothing but the happy unlikeliness of their existence\\" (p. 12), their example has universal application.  \\"All skill acquisitions... operate on the same principle of action\\" (p. 6). He will unlock the secret of skill in maths, art, music, sport and just about everything<br /><br />Coyle argues that students at his hotbeds have discovered their \\"sweet spot\\" by \\"purposely operating at the edges of their ability, so they will screw up\\" (p. 19).  This is \\"deep practice\\" (p. 16), a process in which one allows his/herself to fail in order to succeed, for \\"a microsecond of struggle can make all the difference\\" (p. 17). Failures and self criticism enable students to accelerate their learning.<br /><br />Coyle's proposition is as extravagant and seductive as his promise: \\"you will not read a more important and useful book\\" (dustcover).  Yet his hypothesis is not testable, his sample size statistically insignificant and even those few data points he gives us do not bear scrutiny.<br /><br />Coyle offers no clear definition of any of his terms, like `greatness', `hotbed', `talent code', `sweet spot', `deep practice'. He does not frame his hypothesis in a way that might be tested, such as \\"in small communities that foster `deep practice' there is a higher likelihood of `great' performance\\".  Instead, he attempts \\"proof by selected instances\\" (Thouless, 1953, pp. 15-21).<br /><br />His sample size is tiny; he has not done the research to prove his theory statistically. Furthermore, every one of the cases he chooses as evidence is questionable. His main example, outstanding Brazilian soccer players, fails to acknowledge the spread of their geographic origins across that huge country (there is no chicken-wire Harvard here).<br /><br />Coyle tells us nothing new. Notions such as \\"muscle-memory\\" acquired through extensive practice have been popular in coaching circles for years (Krakauer, 2006).  Yet his up-beat success stories play reassuringly to the assumptions of our Protestant work ethic: that hard work and perseverance are redemptive (Weber, 1959).<br /><br />For Coyle's thesis to be useful, we would need to understand:  where and how nurture takes over from nature in the cultivation of greatness; how to mitigate risks for students; and, how to strike and maintain the balance between ambition and capability that will keep students in their sweet spot. He addresses none of this.<br /><br />Most striking, perhaps, is Coyle's suggestion that this paradox - \\"talent hotbeds are mysterious places\\" (p. 1) - has survived so long in the face of the huge economic and competitive incentives to improve performance. For, even if Coyle's talent-code formula might now bestow competitive advantage on those who apply it, any edge thus acquired will soon be eroded as others practice his advice to attain greatness irrespective of the talents (or lack of them) that they were born with.<br /><br />Does it matter that Coyle's language is emotional and his logic fallacious if he is merely advocating the sensible action of working hard to pursue one's goal?  Yes it does, because Coyle underplays that second dimension of greatness: flair, creativityand imagination.<br /><br />For example, we judge the excellence of ballet and gymnastics on both technique and artistry (USA Gymnastics, 2013). Practice, practice, practice might make you a virtuoso musician, but instrumental virtuosity is not sufficient to become the greatest of performers. This is the thinking behind \\"inner game theory\\" and it takes an opposite view to Coyle's. This holds that self-criticism results in fear, doubt, lapses in focus, and limiting concepts or assumptions. We need to inhibit self-criticism to achieve top performance, so that our superior natural game can emerge (Gallwey, 2009). We need the self-confidence to let our minds wander and be creative, and not repeat the same old response when we come under pressure. This is a completely different talent, not so readily codified.<br /><br />You'll laugh until you cry.<br /><br />REFERENCES:<br /><br />Gallwey, W. Timothy. (2009).

B0010SKUYM|5.0|A new favorite of mine. I couldn't put this series down. Can't wait for the last one to come out!
B003WTE886|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday present for my granddaughter. I like her choice of music considering all the trash genres out there which have vulgar lyrics and present subject matter not appropriate for pre-teens.
B0055S348W|1.0|I first downloaded the free app from Google market, and it found my wi-fi printer right away. Then my husband reminded me that about a year ago, I actually purchased this app from amazon market, so I uninstalled the free app from google market and installed this paid one. The paid one cannot find my printer!! Maybe I should ask for $$ back and purchase it  from google market instead
B005HSGB6W|5.0|I loved the move & wanted to read the book.  You know how everyone says &#34;The book is ALWAYS better...&#34;????  Well, it's definitely true in this case!  The book has an additional chapter(the last chapter), & put a totally different spin on the story.  What an AWESOME addition!!!!  Made me love it even more!  It tied up a lot of loose ends, and made the story richer & more clear. Whether you're a fan of the movie, or a Kubrick &#34;newbie&#34;, READ THIS BOOK!!!  You won't be disappointed!!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A new favorite of mine. I couldn't put this series down. Can't wait for the last one to come out!
B0013FSL3E|3.0|I bought this movie because I don't go to theaters (price of tickets and treats is too high and I'd rather stay home) and my son said it was cute. I sent it to him and his kids after I watched it - once. It took me a while to get into the late of vocalism. At the end of the movie I thought,.. gee, this is nothing but an anti-pollution and anti-couch-potato animated documentary. I don't like agenda movies in any form (live action or animated). Movies put out which seem to only promote a social or economic or other specific agenda are movies I can't like. The new Dr. Seuss movie seems to fall into that category as well as it seems to exist to promote the Green Agenda, These movies, whose messages may or may not be good are a creepy form of mass indoctrination/brainwashing for children
B0063M22QO|2.0|this game does not have enough options, such as starting game over, changing tile styles. should let you know how many tiles left
1577314808|1.0|I was genuinely curious about the authors transformation, and appreciated his story.  The lessons in being present, and examining and transforming the pain, joy, disappointment...that make us human are consistent with other teachings.  What I did not appreciate is the authors' almost complete disregard for the physical being.  After listening to the chapters that reinforced that underneath it all, we are nothing, and that our physical existence really is meaningless, I was glad I'm not severely depressed.  These messages could have sent me much deeper.  Then, upon the realization that I'm supposed to temper my joy, passion, emotion, even anxiety to the point where I no longer really experience it, made me truly wonder why I would want to continue on the path to full enlightenment.  I actually enjoy the challenges and feelings of being human, for better or worse, and being concious and present helps me to improve my state and that of the people around me.  The lessons in this book might have one conclude that enlightenment, while peaceful, would be quite boring, and of little use.  What the author misses, is that God put is in a body for  a reason.  The complex brain chemistry, and all of the baggage that goes along with being human was granted to us for the time that we remember it.  Perhaps our purpose is to use our enlightened selves to continue to evolve man's existence, or pave the way to the next life, or the afterlife?  The author makes a very weak attempt at the end to propose that we could apply our enlightened state to help others, but it seems an afterthought.  There are far better books on the market that offer similar messages in a much more postive way.
0449009548|4.0|Just finished listening to Clancy's \\"Rainbow Six\\" on CD in my truck. Good read and continuous action! Only 6 CDs so it must have been abridged (wife got it from the library and they stickered the case up big time so I could not tell).
1423136802|5.0|My granddaughter is a Rick Riordan fan and was really pleased when she received this book set as a 2011 Christmas gift. She is starting to save 'special' books building her personal library.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much to the point of not wanting to put it down.  A good love story, but regretably sad at the same time.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I just received this today.  Listening to it, I'm convinced it is Susan's best yet.  The music is fresh, the arrangements are interesting, and Susan (with friends) performs with an energy beyond anything she's published to date.  I'm very happy for her.  And, I love the CD.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|It takes it a while to get going.  It is all told in almost an oral format.  Almost all flashback.  Writing is good and griping toward the end defiantly setting up the second book.  Look forward to reading the second one.
B001E75QH0|3.0|The First movie was slow but real good. The second was not as slow but not as good. After that they were good but not spectacular. Still if you like more than one of them, might as well get the collection - it costs about the same as buying just a couple of them. If my husband is watching the first one, I'll watch it with him, the others he watches by himself.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I am big fan of the Lord of the Rings Series. Well, I still remain a big fan of the series, but this spin off is not made well. You don't find yourself caring for the characters. If Lord of the Rings is a book, Hobbit would be a comic book for kids.
B005VTS4EY|1.0|I don't know if this is a good game or not. I never could get this game to work on my tablet.
B00BE5U7P8|2.0|This book follows the Dummies template pretty closely: the light start, cheesy asides, etc. But John I know can do better. The OOP is not well explained. And one of the most important aspects of VBA programming is not even discussed: 1) when do you code in the module, 2) when do you raise a userform and code behind and when do you code 3) in the worksheet.<br /><br />This is a glaring omission. I have coded extensively in VB. The model is clear: you code 90% in behind the form, certain modules common to the application go in the standard module, there is no worksheet to worry about.<br /><br />John appears to have wasted too much time on charts and addins and customising the ribbon (who cares?) which could have easily been held over to More VBA for Dummies.<br /><br />I am going to look around for a better book on VBA.<br /><br />Owing to this obvious and glaring omission I am giving the book 2 stars.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I got this movie at the request of my husband. He watches it several times a year. It doesn't have the depth nor special effects of today's Sci-Fi but it is still Classic early sci-fi at it's best.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good movie that both holds your attention and makes you start thinking about a government with such sweeping powers.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I loved most of the songs on this release, liked a couple others. Some of the are happy love songs, some are about hope for making dreams happen.  Good mix of high and slower energy and as always, good lyrics.  Have bothe the cd and downloaded to my cloud. Great concert too!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who believes in life after death.  It is also a great book for non-believers because it is a scientific book of what happens to someone when they die. This is a true story of a neurosurgeon who died, went to heaven, then came back to life after a week.  He was actually pronounced dead by other neurosurgeons and the only conclusion they could come with was that there really is life after death.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I liked getting the transformers for my sons (who are now 28 & 34 years old). They also enjoyed the Transformers cartoons on TV. My oldest was thrilled when the first movie came out and Optimus Prime was the same voice as the early cartoon series. I think I've enjoyed the movies even more than they have. I'm crazy about the Transformers, always have been.
B002KH4KSY|5.0|I thought it would be bad but a Friend of mine say it was good so I get it & I love this Children of the corn more that the first one!!!<br />It's like a New DVD!!!<br />There is nothing wrong with this DVD!!!
B008Y79HE6|1.0|This is not Godzilla. I watched this movie many times and I get sick every time after seeing what they did to him. Hopeful the new coming out will be better but this movie needs to burn by atomic breath.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game, easy and fun to play, kills lots of time. Price is right too. I would highly recommend it.
B00009XITQ|4.0|I've watched this movie several times on TV and a few times since I got the DVD. It's a cute movie about the adventure of a teenager (Amanda Bynes) , the daughter of a 'hippie-singer', who runs off to London to meet her father who is a duke. Of course, his mother (her grandmother) and his fiancee' and her daughter don't know anything about his having a daughter. She is invited (by her grandmother) to stay with them and then the fun begins. Naturally there is a scandal (her dad is running for some office in Parliament or something like that. She doesn't quite fit into high society UK style and the fiancee' and daughter want her gone. Meanwhile, she has a London boyfriend and a way of shaking up her stodgy duke dad much to the distaste of his fiancee' and his campaign manager/future father-in-law. Then, of course, the American mom has to come retrieve her and sees the duke for the first time in like 17 years.... a fun lighthearted movie. Grandmother is a great character who likes the shake up caused by the new granddaughter.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is a must see/own movie. I recieved it the day it was released at home and I am very happy by purchasing it thru this company.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|The level of badness scene always makes me giggle as well as Stitch all dressed up as Elvis.  In some ways Lilo is totally my hero.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Good plot at the beginning, but toward the end it becomes a little to unrealistic. How did she suddenly appear in the barn? The escape in helicopter? The analysis of his relationship with his daughter would need a little more dept. Overall ok, still worth a read, but not as good as the early Harry Bosh books
B00005KAQP|5.0|Not exactly a 'Trouble with Angels' movie but a cute movie all the same. As far as the lives of real nuns, I don't believe this is a good or believable example. It is, though, a fun movie where the good guys win in the end.<br /><br /> Basically Whoopi goes into protective custody/hiding from her gangster buddies. She makes an unlike candidate for sisterhood and has trouble adapting to the restrictions of a modest life. After all, she is a nightclub singer/floozy. . She manages to make her mark at the nunnery and brings new life to the church neighborhood. Eventually word gets out as to where she's hiding and the nuns come to her rescue in a wild romp through Las Vegas. Good music, heartwarming parts.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I am not a hardcore evanescence fan but this is by far one of their best albums I recommend this album to anyone who is interested in expanding their music taste
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Amazing! I love Theory of a Deadman and I love all their stuff. This album is wonderful! Love all the songs! The condition was A+ and I definitely recommend!
0062082353|5.0|I got this for me and two of my high school buddies. We all have really enjoyed reading his stories. Hard to believe that this legend is no longer with us. Seriously - 2,100 yard shot - confirmed and he eyeballed it!! WOW!
B0014I4KH6|4.0|Somehow the newest Taylor Swift CD ends up being on my granddaughter's Christmas or Birthday wish list. Amazon makes it easy to spoil her long distance. I buy it and they send it to her in another state. I'm just happy she's listening to music which doesn't have vulgar or implicit lyrics. I wouldn't buy that stuff for her nor would my son allow it.
B000002G6J|5.0|One of his best A&M CTI gems. I love the Pete Turner cover art. This is one of those cd collections that can be listened to from start to finish more than once. The orchestrations are so lush, and supports the reason Jobim and Claus Ogerman respected each other so much. Three tracks are particularly exciting and also very sensuous. &#34;The Red Blouse&#34;, &#34;Triste&#34; and most notable &#34;Antigua&#34; will capture you. Not one effort by Jobim showed more balance than this collection of bossa nova classics.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Every actor absolutely shone in my opinion.  I enjoyed this book so much in my youth and the movie was 10x better than I had hoped it would be.  Loved it and plan to buy it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm not a big reader but this book I started and I couldn't put it down.  Excellent book and a great read.
B00005S6K8|4.0|When this movie came out, I didn't rush out to see it, even though I adore Harrison Ford. I didn't see it until it came on TV. After all, the original Sabrina has been one of my favorites since my early teens (over 40 years ago). When I finally did see it, I enjoyed it because it was pretty much an entirely different story. The original story line was nicely updated to modern times when the age difference of 20s to 40s isn't as drastic as it was back when the original was made. Also, the heroine has a career (photography) in the modern version, unlike being daughter of 'the Help' with no expectations other than becoming the 'Help' herself and marrying another member of the Help. Even the playboy brother isn't as much a stereotype. I like the change of useless debutante fiancee' of the brother into a career woman in the updated version. This is a nice movie. It doesn't have the romance of the original and will never replace the original in the minds and hearts of lovers of the original Sabrina but it is a worthy movie in it's own right and shouldn't be compared to the incomparable movie that the original is. This is more a Re-Do for present era than a remake.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent! Love the show! Deals with today's problems and the Wife has a lot of character and is believable! Love it!
B0045ODPKY|5.0|This is an action movie that never lets up.  the story line is a little cold war, but it's damned effective, and quite believable.  I was thrown a bit on the ending, but then remembered I ordered the Theatre edition and not both versions of the ending.  Great movie.  5 stars all the way.  Seller was great.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|With his wonderful voice and stron songs. Like he is Always there. A good cover of the Tony Joe White song rainy day in Georgia.
B0000033RY|5.0|Shipped fast. Cactus should have been bigger, but they are still great and this collection has the best of all their output!
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is awesome! Unrealistic sure but entertaining and fast moving! Fun fun fun! So happy the season is longer than other shows
B00BEYYO8U|5.0|I have been anxiously waiting to get this the third Bond film with Daniel Craig as Bond.  After Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace this was a total surprise.  Craig is still the very physical Bond and is incredible as always.  The storyline is out of left field and you have to pay close attention to what is going on or you'll get lost.  I'm not going to spoil anything but there are more than a few surprises and endings for some people we've gotten to know in the other two films.  It is not as action packed as the previous two films, but this is still a 5 star film and I do encourage Daniel Craig Bond fans to get it.  I'm not downplaying the film, it is excellent, it just isn't up to the expectations, the previous two films gave us.  Seller was fantastic, had it in my hands in under a week.  Pick it up.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very, very addictive. Parents watch your account charges. I want to keep playing even when I have to wait for coins to regenerate.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|I downloaded this for my son because he loves the book so much. He now loves the game as well.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I have this in my car and I put it in on long drives. It is a great soundtrack to the road and keeps my road rage to a minimum, ha.
6305090564|5.0|I love this movie.  Have loved it since the first time I saw it at the theatre.  Treat Williams is on top of his game, his quirky sense of humor and one liners are classic.  Story line is pretty damned good.  It has a lot of twists and is well played.  This is a great movie, it's like a haunted house at sea.  Love it.  Seller was great, had this in a few days after ordering.  Pick it up if you like action, horror, and comedys rolled into one.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|good  story and  revealing  truths  about  family  ties and  relationships  and  all the  things  you  keep  inside  for  so  long
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It is a show on the darker side of things, however; I do like the way they inject bits of humor here and there (with a few episodes poking fun at the characters and the show itself). They are not heroes in the truest since of the word, they do take liberties that maybe a more &#34;righteous&#34; hero wouldn't but you learn to overlook their minor faults. For me, it's a guilty pleasure!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Not sure how this even got in the race, for I do not use this app either. Suppose it is good, but I do not even have a Kindle!
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Stellar cast, great story, non stop action, this is a great movie.  Special effects are awesome and amazing.  If you want a great action movie, pick this one up, wont be sorry.  5 stars.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|After seeing the movie and stage productions, I think it seemed a little too dark to view  easily.  Hugh Jackson was fantastic.Music came through vibrant and beautiful.  We are still enjoying it.  Thank you for helping us get our UPS Distribution to get our correct address.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I was a little nervous about this new album, when some people said that it didn't &#34;sound like Fall Out Boy&#34;. But after receiving it and listening to it, I fell in love and felt like this was one of the best albums that they have done so far. I would reccommend it to any fan, it is well worth it, and so amazing to hear after the hiatus.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|WOW! Here again, I do not use MP3 items on my cell phone. Again, one of many apps that I do not use. Sorry
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite shows. It is so well-written and so well-acted I can say that I &#34;respect&#34; this show. It's quality enough to have been on HBO or Showtiime (although they probably would've taken one of my stars away by adding gratuitous sex/violence). It balances interesting cases with the personal relationships between the characters which are very well-developed (so well that it would have made a good book). There are plenty of story lines to keep up with: the case at hand; the politics within the firm and between firms; sexual politics; the politics of the title character's husband in state government;the effect of everything on the main character's teenaged children; and the very interesting goings-on and history of the firm's and the D.A.'s investigators. I am actually watching Season 4 and went back to re-watch the first 3 seasons since I did miss some of them -- and I'm glad to say my review holds true for all four seasons!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Well it had its good parts, but I would say it will go down as one of my all time books. Enjoyable, just the same.
B00006F7IM|5.0|Harry Doyle here from inside the TeePee.  We've got a great one for you today!  Roger Dorn spikes himself, Ricky Vaugn leaves a 2 foot hole coming out of Clu Heywood and Tom Berenger make an appearance in another movie.<br /><br />BEST. BASEBALL. MOVIE. EVER.

B00BQBNK04|5.0|I loved the movie Les Miserables. Although I reviewed the songs of various Broadway and concert performances and those performances are awesome,  the rawness of the actors' voices from the movie just move me so much and I recall the various scenes as the songs are playing. Very moving and enjoyable.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I gave this writing because this book by Victor Hugo - is so indepth without being boring... you may need to recalls so history and a bit of world history, French and Latin to get all of it...but even without... it is a marvelous book.  Brings to life a past we don't really know - yet it seems so alive - just amazing.  It really is a must read!

B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I'm not a fan of Daniel Day Lewis, so this was a hard sell in the first place. I said to my daughter when it was over (she wanted to see it), &#34;I could have told you that story in about 2 minutes.&#34; LOL. What you should get from this review, is that even for someone who isn't a history buff, or a fan of the actors in this movie, it was &#34;okay&#34;. If you like DDL, history, and in particular politics, you will likely not be disappointed with this film.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|Compared to previous live shows and the movie, it is the most beautiful sound, sight and spectacle of every version.  The bonus of the original cast at the end is worth every penny alone!
B00005JMCT|1.0|This movie is written for people under 25 who want to be grossed out. Most other people will find it tasteless and depressing. It is undoubtedly funny in places, but anyone with intelligence will see a manipulative writer's hand all over it, trying desperately to come up with something to keep the franchise going. Mission achieved with \\"American Reunion\\"! But at a price. This movie has a 4 and 5 star percentage of just 58%, very low for such a highly ranked box office movie. But it's not really a movie, just a bunch of tasteless scenes strung together so under 25's can talk about them and work out where to draw the line - that would be at Stifler and the grandmother.<br /><br />In the DVD extras, writer Adam Herz confesses to a significant part of Stifler in his own character, so much so that he started acting a bit like Steve Stifler in his own life. It is a seriously disturbing revelation. This is the man who crossed the line with the grandmother. Where won't he go? And if it was just for the money, is that a good enough excuse?
B00B23O96A|3.0|Super classic EC a true master very pleasant to the ear as always but nothing really unheard before in terms of sound.

B00B22IJXK|3.0|Drawing is really a foot note in this app, it's more of a semi-decent photo editor with a decent ui. It has the same level of control as Draw Something, and not much more.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I have read mixed reviews on the last book, after having read it I can see why some felt the need to review it that way.  Maybe the story didn't take off the way that everyone wanted or expected it to.  Certain story lines went against expectations, but if it were to have followed the expectations would it have hooked us?  I don't think so, it hooked us because we were expecting them to make a left and the story made a right.  This wasn't my favorite of the three, but I thought that the story line flowed and left enough questions to warrant the need for a George Lucas type prequel to read after you have seen everything else.

B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I love this story. A self absorbed teen learns what it is like in the real world and has his heart  and attitude changed for the better. The dialog and one liners have me laughing all the time... like &#34; I'm not listening!.... Still not listening... I giggle now thinking of it, and how we can get into trouble by not listening.<br />I think this movie is great for all ages. I think you will enjoy it.
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|OK, the Eagles studio albums included are classic, and sublimely enjoyable.  But the &#34;Eagles Live&#34; double vinyl album (now on CD of course) should have been included, since it was a coda for the original run of the band.<br /><br />Naturally getting all the original studio albums in one neet package, is a bargain and a great listening experience.<br /><br />If the live album were included, I would have given it a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Sadly if you enjoy the Eagles you probably have Greatest Hits Vol 1 and or 2.  Thus you own most of the treasures here.  Make a financial decision if you are a casual listener.  If you &#34;need&#34; the full albums, GO FOR IT.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|My wife loved the movie, because of my military background I actually watched the movie and liked it because of its military tie in.  While on a reading tear I came across the book and thought, why not?  This is a book written by a dude and it actually has a lot of dude parts.  I would expect that a lot of readers may have tuned out or lost interest at the middle 3rd of the book when he focuses on his military escapades and his relationship with his father (the latter really left out of the movie).  I was extremely impressed with the character and the authors intent on showing how he worked to rebuild his relationship with his father before he passed on.  Being a father of an autistic child myself, I actually learned a tip of how to communicate with my child.  Great book, not a chick flick book.
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|A newer and fresh album for him.  Outstanding songs with his special interpretations.  Outstanding.  A fitting salute to some great songwriters.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Excellent album as Dylan never stands still, always changing, morphing and giving us some of the best music of the age.
B00AYJCEYC|3.0|Having seen Michael Bolton up close and personal in the last few years in a small theater with my constant concert companion (CCC) I know he is capable of great vocals and actually plays a wicked lead guitar.  He is better than this collection.<br /><br />Like the Beatles, Motown covers are a thin ice situation.  The songs are so great you can't help but let them take you away and engulf you in pure joy.  But the originals are largely the definitive versions.  Even Michael McDonald, who was born to sing Motown (and R&B and more) did just a good job on Motown.  I heard McDonald do a few of these songs with the CCC and we agreed, good but not to take your breath away.<br /><br />So, if you are a Bolton fan, or a collector of Motown interpretations, do not hesitate to snag this album.  If you just want something by Mr. Bolton that you will play and play, get one of the various hits collections available.  Sorry Mike(s)....Motown is a very tough sandwich to bite into.

B0017SUZ54|4.0|Naomi Steiner's book was so much better but for different reasons. I felt like this book was a textbook. It was so detailed, which as a graduate student, I can appreciate but it just wasn't what I was looking for and I can't picture the average parent getting much out of it. The studies were very well researched and I am sure some college professors use this book - they should! So depending on what you want from a book will depend if you like this one imo...
B0057VDGNK|5.0|Seriously, if you saw the movie, and you noticed the music enough to look this item up on Amazon, buy this album.<br /><br />I own the movie, and I waited to buy the album, but the album is like an extension pack to the movie, owning just one would be incomplete.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I've been looking at this watch for a while now and finally bought it. For a mechanical watch it keeps time pretty good. Mine loses about 1minute after 5 days of continually wearing it. It's an average size watch, not too big not too small. It glows good in the dark. The strap is very comfortable. I like the see-through back to view the mechanical movement. The only down side to this watch along with many other Seiko mechanical watches is that you can't manually wind the watch, its only automatic. If you plan to wear it every day you'll be fine but if you set it down for a couple days it will die. Other than that its a great watch, definitely worth the price!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second book in the series....still a must have and an excellent story.  Teens and adults can both enjoy this series.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Not sure why but I did not like this book. Parts of it were okay, and I can see why others may like it but I refer back to me hating romance/sex novels and this one just got really old. It seemed so repetitive and the whole idea just seemed ludicrous to me. Well, actually, the idea at first I loved - the idea of just waking up married. It could have been so funny, so good - but the author never made it that way - it was just repetitive and boring to me. I wanted to like it, I wanted it to pick up and get better. I read half way, then started just skimming it to 70 percent done and it was STILL the same plot - the man trying to &#34;keep&#34; her. Ugh, just annoying to me. Especially when you know the ending - I just wanted them to move along, have some kids already or SOMETHING to change the plot. Okay, I'm done ;)
B000W4KSWO|5.0|During the final decade and a half of Duke Ellington's life, he become more and more creatively productive. One of the key elements of this was showcasing the progression of his own personal compositional stamp-evolving elements of it to adapt to the new sounds of the decade in which he was creating. Part of this involved willing collaborations with some of the newest musical innovators in jazz. And few were making more abrupt innovations in their instrumental approach to playing in the early 60's than John Coltrane. With Elvin Jones and Sam Woodyard doubling up on drums with Jimmy Garrison and Aaron Bell doing the same on bass this album proved that Ellington's interest in recording with Coltrane was in fact ingenious.<br /><br />  Overall this is a musically wonderful album. But as with just about any music involving Coltrane, it has a quality about it that simply isn't always easy to put into words. The opening \\"In A Sentimental Mood\\" is one of the most entrancing melodies in jazz and,in this particular version,is one of my favorite jazz pieces. But it's appeal goes beyond romanticism. Its the way Ellington lightly touches the keys of the piano, the way Coltrane holds the last note of each melodic phrase like a musical mantra. On \\"Take The Coltrane\\" the two musicians swing hard together in Duke's classic style. Still 'Trane's playing maintains his own soul searching quality on contrast to Duke's concentration on the rhythm and melody.<br /><br />  \\"Big Nick\\" is the lone Coltrane composition here-still very much involved in the blues but of course the man himself is already taking it to a whole other place. That bluesy flavor maintains throughout \\"My Little Brown Book\\" and \\"The Feeling Of Jazz\\". While \\"Stevie\\" again swings away \\"Angelica\\" is the most spirited uptempo composition here-with a Caribbean rhythmic flavor similar to Sonny Rollins' \\"St. Thomas\\". Likely my second favorite number here. The mixture of intellectual and emotional understanding of how human beings are affected by melody and rhythm are the key forces in what drives the creative energies of both Ellington and Coltrane. Both have somewhat different outlooks on it. But these somehow converge in harmony here to give this album a deeply intangibale musical qualityings are affected by melody and rhythm are the key forces in what drives the creative energies of both Ellington and Coltrane.

B00005614N|5.0|In all honestly, the individual contributions to the development of jazz from Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong couldn't be more different.  Armstrong's music was ebullient and filled with his personal love of living life. Duke Ellington was a more aloof figure and a tireless creator-writing for individual musicians and therefore becoming America's greatest composer to come directly from the jazz age. Yet musically both musicians had a style that was extremely compatible. An enormous part of that compatibility was jazz improvisational itself but there was a deeper level to it.  Both artists had dealt with difficulties in the 1950's. For Ellington, it was a commercial slack period until decades end. For Armstrong it was the cultural rejection by a younger African American generation who misunderstood his performance persona. So when Bob Thiele produced this session for RCA records in 1961 between the two jazz titans, there could be no musical misunderstanding whatsoever.<br /><br />  Basically what this represents is a series of Ellington compositions featuring Loius Armstrong on trumpet and vocals. \\"Duke's Place\\" is the idea opener: Duke and Louis swinging away on piano and trumpet with Satchmo of course taking on the vocals in his classic style. And this album is full of swing,swing,swing-both instrumentally and vocally because that is the one thing Duke and Armstrong had in common musically. A mixture of like minded instrumentals such as \\"Cottontail\\",\\"The Beautiful American\\",\\"It Don't Mean A Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing\\" and \\"Just Squeeze Me\\". Of course another element Duke and Satchmo had in common was a love of the blues. This is reflect in new interpretations on Ellington standards such as \\"Mood Indigo\\",\\"Black And Tan Fantasy\\",\\"In A Mellow Tone\\" and Louis's soulful and penetrating take on \\"Solitude\\"-something of a male vocalists perspective on a number that is vocally most associated with Billy Holiday.<br /><br />  Instrumentally is a major area where this album succeed. Accompanied by what was basically Armstrong's group, Duke's orchestral piano informed by both Harlem stride playing and his own instrumental dissonances of course is contrasted by the spirited and almost always carnivalesque atmospherics of Satchmo's lively trumpet playing-with all of its vocal calls,quavers and the power he had in holding a single note nearly into infinity that defined his last decade of playing. When I listened to this recording, it made me wonder what circumstances had kept these two major figures in jazz history from recording together during their heyday. They were honestly near the ends of their respective careers when these songs were recorded. Still it was better late than never since,in both cases, it was an open and shut matter than neither of their creative powers had at this point abandoned them.s album succeed.

And do in fact regret purchasing it.<br />It is not a bad book, and my expectations, which are grounded in rave reviews,  may have tainted my experience. Nevertheless, it contains uninspiring use of the language, stumbling attempts of tension and above all, an unacceptable tame finale.<br /><br />J.M.B.

B0052AC8C6|5.0|For those who don't much care for animated movies, this one is a definite exception.  It tells a fascinating story with artful animation and special visual effects, excites both young and older viewers, and has a timely message for all.  Voices are excellently matched to the characters, and the script is as well written as one in a &#34;real&#34; (live action) movie.  Highly recommended.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|Made me stop and think about my own attitudes toward others.  I felt there was way too much history that was irrelevant to the story.  Explanations of philosophy was good to a point, but seemed very repetitious and lengthy.  There were too many French terms and phrases; and no definition for many words. I would recommend a condensed version that has less history and not quite so much repetitive philosophy.  It did make me recognise the importance of : quality of life, being aware of others, humility, and necessity of an education.

B000HZHBIM|4.0|Oftentimes while watching this film, I think &#34;I get it! Stop it already!&#34; - There are really, really long shots of the Enterprise, really long shots of &#34;stuff&#34; - &#34;2001&#34; style, but I understand why. People were still amazed by those long shots, and so excited to get their Trek on the screen. Those with love for Star Trek can accept this film's glaring faults - because this movie helped keep that which we love so well alive.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A good read. I cared about the main character and wanted to find out what drove him to do what he did. Not a fast- paced action piece but I kept turning the pages to see what would be revealed next.

It is not.. there is not even one bit of functionality in this app that can't be done with the Aviary (did I mention that it's free)... Why pay money for something that is provided by the true software developer for free.<br /><br />It's a good thing this app was today's &quot;Free App of the Day&quot; on Amazon, else I would be furious if I paid for duplicate programming that is already on my phone.<br /><br />To recap, misleading screen shots, which give potential users a look at a user interface that doesn't exist... The art work created in screenshots is nearly impossible to create with this app... (Looks like a butterfly clone brush and expert use of filters , neither of which are actual functions in this app)... And an audacity to ask for money for something that is free from actual developer... A true shame
B005LAIII0|5.0|Went to see it in the theater in 3D.  Probably one of the best 3D movies that came out besides Avatar.  The use of it was subtle and did not take away, but rather, enhanced the experience instead.<br /><br />Excellent story with fantastic visuals.  Some of the underwater scenes simply take your breath away.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Was so good that I needed to add this to my collection.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Purchase as present and the receiver who is my mom loves it very much. She has almost the complete set now which I did not know she was collecting.  She is missing the previous year
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This a super duper funny book!  First it is funny then gets funnier and funnier I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />It is the best game yet take my advice it is awesome! The best yet take my word I would pay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is a good movie and it played well with no problems. It has some adult humor but it is really funny.
0375869026|5.0|I enjoyed the book and shared it with a fifth grader.  She enjoyed it, too.  It is funny and thought provoking.  It opens the door to important discussions about acceptance, self-consciousness, peer pressure and the question of kids who seem to be mean for no reason.  Doesn't talk down to readers and the characters are well drawn, not stereotypes.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended to other people I know.  It really enlightened me on who Steve Jobs really was.  I grew up during this time and live in the Bay Area so it really hit home for me.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Have been using it steadily for a couple of months and I honestly can say I love it. It's very comfortable. The battery life is very good and it's got plenty of range. I was skeptical that there'd be audio lag but there absolutely none. The software that comes with it is kind of buggy and I recommend downloading the software straight from the manufacturers website. The sound is very nice. Have had no issues or complaints with the mic. It amazing the amount of extra sounds you can hear while in a FPS game. Can hear enemy footsteps as if they're dancing elephants. Highly recommend. The port has been very convenient as well and charges my cell phone when it's not charging the head phones.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This is a wonderful second book, with just enough suspense and magic to tease you and make number 3 a must!!!!!!
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Hands down, this show is amazing.  Season 2 was a decent continuation of season 1, though it did have it moments of slowness, I can't complain or name anything they could've done different so for that, it gets a 5/5 and I would recommend and watch again.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|My son LOVED this movie. And I don't particularly like horror movies, but this one is probably the best that I've ever seen.
B00005JLKB|2.0|Smallville: The 1st season was full of filler and the usual storyline/episodes (i.e. \\"meteor-freak\\" high school students with a power featured in almost every episode. Very disappointing. A good season features a long-lasting problem that's resolved towards the end of the season and in the final episode of that season. Season 4, 6, and 7 (and possibly 8, 9, 10) featured just that; a long-lasting problem that's resolved towards the end of the season and in the final episode of that season (i.e. the crystals Clark and Lex look for, Lana and Lex's marriage, etc.). Skip this season and watch seasons 4, 6, and 7 (and possibly 8, 9, 10) instead.
B000MAH5O2|5.0|This book is full of great information about our president.  Fast read.  Highly recommended. Our president is a very interesting president and it is good to know more about him.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The writers of this show deserve awards.  I have never liked horror, but this scenario is so real, and the blood-guts-and gore and very real looking to.  At first it was hard to watch, but now I am used to heads be lopped off :0.<br />Each episode keeps you at the edge of your seat (or the edge of the couch), and looking forward to the next episode.<br />My husband and son equally love this show.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Interesting concept and nicely descriptive writing, but I feel it never lived up to its promise. I needed more about the game, something.
B000TFINY6|5.0|LOST season 3 introduced &#34;the Others&#34; to the viewers and the tension of keeping Jack, Kate, and Sawyer locked up was excellent and made us wonder why they were being locked up. Also, towards the end of this season, it literally started the beginning of the end, just like the 2-part season finale titled &#34;The Beginning of the End&#34;. Although he had a heart and showed it by caring for Claire's baby, the annoying character, Charlie, commits suicide by locking himself in a room that fills with water in the Looking Glass station.<br />A lot of LOST fans disliked this season (possibly because Charlie left), but I totally disagree. This season went in-depth to the Island's &#34;Others&#34; and was reminiscent of J.J. Abrams masterful drama-action storytelling (i.e. with Jack, Kate, and Sawyer locked up in cages) previously seen in one of the other best TV shows, Alias, and the best Mission Impossible sequel, Mission Impossible 3.<br />If you're a true fan of LOST, watch season 3!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtown Abbey is an excellent program. However beware; it is addictive. Very much happens during each episode. Both the upstairs and the downstairs characters are complex. Amazon provides a wonderful listing of shows and movies.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I didn't really know exactly what to expect from Tarantino's latest. I had watched all the trailers and was genuinely excited to see what this film brought to the table. Admittedly, I wasn't expecting much. Unlike nearly everyone else I was not all that impressed by Inglourious Basterds, I never even finished it actually. However, Django Unchained ended up being one of the best movies I have seen in years. Everything in this film comes together in one cohesive piece of storytelling that must be experienced by fans of Tarantino's work and those looking for something a bit different from the normal glut of box office malaise. The movie runs for almost 3 hours and never feels like it. It starts it out with a bang and continues on through never letting up, nor letting your guard down. The script writing is some of the best of recent years and delivers thought provoking moments as well as heart felt ones. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz deliver fine performances as the male leads. They have what comes across as a genuine respect of one another and the situations they face. Dicaprio also delivers, in my opinion, one of his finest, and unexpected performances, as the leader of a plantation called Candie Land. This is not a film for the faint of heart, nor for those uncomfortable with vehicles relating to the horrors of slavery. I promise, however, that the latter, in the end, will not bother you as you will see soon enough that no bad deed goes unpunished. Aside from the usual, I could comment on the music, the cinematography, humor, and a myriad of other things that I found to be fantastic additions to this film. However, I will offer what I consider to be my highest praise. This is the best stuff Tarantino has done since Pulp Fiction. As soon as I finished watching the entire film, I wanted to hit play and watch it all over again!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|There was one song my wife wanted on this cd but after playing the entire cd she is excited about them all
B001AQMBKA|5.0|LOST season 2 starts revealing the &#34;secrets&#34; of the Island by introducing &#34;The Hatch&#34; or &#34;The Swan&#34; Dharma Initiative station. How could you not like this season if you love the show? Also. towards the middle of this season, the fans are introduced to Benjamin Linus (the &#34;leader&#34; of &#34;the Others&#34;) and we're left guessing is he really who he says he is or is he deceiving everyone... That question is answered at the end of this season. If you're a true fan of LOST, watch this season!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I have a Sony Reader and wasn't sure this cover would fit....it fits perfectly! I love the red color and it gives my Reader a luxurious look & feel. I got it for a VERY low price...it may be because there is a slight 'scratch' on the back side and the seller wasn't selling it in the store. However, that is not a concern for me. If it had been on the front, I would have been unhappy, but I'm sure it will get its share of wear as time goes on! I would recommend this cover. It's super comfortable to hold while reading. I still love my actual books & mostly read those, but I will be using this cover & my Reader as the summer camping begins!
B003O86FMW|2.0|A teen/pre-teen soap opera. The first book was an interesting mix of future fiction and survival drama. I lost interest in the second at the lengthy description of makeup.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|my wife really likes this cd. She is a big fan and will be purchasing more of this artist releases
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the ending and every minute of this book and I recommend it to people who love Greek and Roman mythological stories :-).
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I have all my email addresses forwarded to Hotmail.  You don't have to get another app now that Microsoft Hotmail has changed over to MS Outlook.  I continue to receive my emails, with no problems.<br /><br />Way better than gmail.
0394800184|5.0|Favorite since childhood.  Love to give it with other books as a baby gift.  Would highly recommend it, especially read aloud.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Very enjoyable, readable, inspiring book about our motivations and what drives us upward and onward. Never before have I been inspired to run till I puke, hallucinate and then puke some more, but I'll be lacing on my shoes and going for it.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|The only way you should download is if you have a lot of 2 yr olds and their bored I am very disappointed you can't even get it to download properly
B005H29GSI|4.0|The kids disregarded the cards so It's not really a game anymore.  I think we've lost most of the birds/pigs too.  You know how it is.
B000FA675C|5.0|The story is very exciting, and it moves fast, keeping the readers' attention. It also presents background information on historical facts. I love historical novels, and this  book is a mystery surrounded by history.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A well written read, got a little lost in the middle, but redeemed its self at the end.<br />One of those &#34;I wish&#34; books.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i love the game and its helping pass the time when i need to relax, oooooo by the way it was free to download......nuff said
B00B22IJXK|1.0|The app has the same functions as 99% of the other drawing apps with nothing special like it claims to have. I noticed it was nearly identical to another app I have, so I checked the about section and found it is just the free Aviary app that has been repackaged for sale. It would have been a total rip off if it hadn't been the free app of the day. If you paid for it, you got taken.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|Been fan since first album. I like a number of the songs on the album and the extra tracks are better than several on main album. Just like the musicality and depth of older Depeche Mode more than the edgy stripped down version. Still going to the concert in Dallas though and they will always be one of my favorites.
B003CFBQBW|2.0|Maybe my fault in thinking this was the only &#34;Eclipse&#34; music offered that included The Score, I have learned that one must now buy two CD's inorder to receive what used to come as one.
B002SLIALA|5.0|Everwood was a widely under appreciated show when it was on the air. I count myself as one of the lucky ones that watched this show from the beginning. Season one of this series was beautifully written set against one of the most beautiful back drops in television history. This is a character driven drama that has many intense emotional moments but also offers plenty of humor that helps makes this show easy and fun to watch. If you like this series I also recommend October Road.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Loved this film, thought it lost steam 3/4 of the way through but it picked up at the end. Loved the music, loved the characters.  Waiting for the sequel.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Even if you don't have a dog, you can't help enjoying this book. Written from a dog's perspective, it will warm your heart. Funny, engaging and easy to read it will be a book you might reread from time to time, if you have a dog.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Good game so far.  A lot of room for creatively, and unique lay outs to be created by the player.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. It was well written.  Connor talked Megan into giving the marriage a try with no love involved.  It had twists and turns in it.  Loved it.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|I watched the movie after having read the book. This story is very eye-opening and is a reminder of the atrocious things that happened during the Nazi regime. The movie has good acting and is fairly true to the story; however, I would have been a little confused if I had not read the book first.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|My only grip is that the rubber isolating mounts like to come off easier than I would like them to while rough handling. It does come with extra rubber mounts, nice.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|When I first saw the game I thought it would be boring but after killing the entire human  race I found that I wanted to try it differently or try another difficulty also I enjoyed the news part
B0055S348W|5.0|I replaced my Asus tf 101 with a Kindle Fire 8.9 HD. I had the Epson IPrint App on my Asus so I side loaded this on my Kindle Fire. The app worked good for photos but not for word docs so I removed it. Found the PrinterShare Mobile Print app and purchased it. Works great with my WiFi Epson printer. It is great being able to print form my Kindle. One of my better apps.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|A movie with a sci-fi slash independent feel that starts off with a catchy opening leaving you wanting to watch more, but in the in end it sends the viewer into spirals themselves.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This is an excellent cookbook.  The recipes are interesting and creative.  Everyone should have a copy on their bookshelf.  Buy it now.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this series.  Read the first book via audio book (mistake) and I think I read the second and third books in two days.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|This is one of my favorite Kurt Russell movies.  Make it a must see and enjoy on a rainy day.
B005XLN77O|5.0|I bought this for a birthday gift for our granddaughter. She is really enjoying designing new fashion for her Barbie doll.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a whirlwind of emotions. It was awesome to feel the love and relationship grow between Sky and Dean. I also liked how he was trying to protect her from her past, while also trying but not trying to help her remember who he was. It was a great story.
B0072X2NUS|4.0|I love the simplicity and \\"retro\\" playfulness of this material from Vince and Martin; you get the impression that this was simply fun for the boys, and perhaps can be better understood that way -- I read and understand some of the more disappointed reviews, but when I listened (the second time through) with the approach that this was less ground-breaking, and more willfully sly smiling, it starts to click into place, and I totally enjoy listening to these tracks.  Due to the analog sound (though I'm not sure if all these sounds were created with analog synths, or if they were simply emulated), I do see little \\"references\\" to other inovators -- there's a bit of Giorgio Moroder sprinkled in, a flavor of early-80's Tangerine Dream (here and there), some mile-markers to very early 90's techno (early Autechre, maybe?).  Again, it's nice to have these two \\"playing nice\\" with each other, after so many years, and in such a unique way (not actually working face-to-face, such as how Dead Can Dance used to work, etc.).  Taken lightly, you'll find that this can be an enjoyable morning listen.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is perfect if you want a fun distraction to your hectic life. It's easy to play and it even has a fake audience to boo when you lose a good coin or a prize. Hilarious.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Typical Great Clint Eastwood movie. I will definitely recommend it and will watch it again. We need more movies like this one and Gran Torino.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I can't believe this is listed as a comedy.  Most depressing movie ever.  Usually love Charlise Theron but want her to give me my money  back.  Don't do it people.  Just don't.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A brilliant piece of work, I have watched it many times and would suggest it as great watching for many.
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|I think if I would have watched this movie before seeing &#34;the Girl&#34; on HBO about Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren I may have liked it. I wouldn't have loved it but I may have liked it. If you haven't seen &#34;The Girl&#34; I definitely recommend a watch on that one. The Hitchcock part was played superbly by Toby Jones.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|So nice to have both versions...on my Ipad and DVD.<br /><br />Was a quick shipment and really enjoy this movie! Aca-Awesome!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have evernote on my phone, computers, kindles. It replaces what sticky notes used to be for me. It is a must have app.
0307476073|1.0|For the life of me I can not imagine why Oprah would of considered this self involved diary by the author, book club material.  Time and time again I was amazed that the author managed to evade terrible outcomes from her poorly thought out choices.  But fear not, she always has someone or something else to blame it on.  What an absolute waste of paper and ink.
B00A9C3RNQ|1.0|I did NOT want a video...I was trying to order a movie...and I cannot return it??????? Ick...I am furious to say the least.  And I am also you used my gift card without my permission.  Guess what?  I want my account deleted and I am going to block you from any further emails.  Reply and tell me my account is gone.
0802136834|5.0|Alison Weir tells a beautiful fluid story about the women in Henry VIII's life and how each of these dynamic women affected his rule. She gives a respectful account of the events that took place at this time while keeping the reader engaged. I love and respect her work.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app soooo much! I love all the ideas and great tips we get from Pinterest! It has made DIY projects, my job, my home, and my fashion blossom!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Paid for this app and when it tries to download wmv codec it says it's not compatible with device! Stay away from this app.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Five stars for this type of movie. Everything I expected it to be. Would recommend to others that like this type of film.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Needs to be more rooms and more puzzles. Wish that they would make another mysy or riven game for tablet.
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|Not worth talking about the movie, I did not like, and that's it. I have to put 7 more words. Ok that is it!
B00BFTV09K|4.0|This is really an eye opener of a read - we just dont realize how hectic the SALT/Sugar/Fat industry works to get us eating more foods
B003G4W49C|1.0|The worst book ever never want to read it again as long as I live if my teacher gives my reading group the 2nd book I am going get sooooooooooo enraged and hit something!!!!!!!#!!!!!:>
B007FH9GA6|5.0|Just loved it. I am not going to start talking about the movie because you have to watch it!. Yes I would recommend it to a friend
B0011UJMK2|1.0|I have to admit, i liked the opening. The author was clearly very good at creating atmosphere. But the characters are incoherent and one dimensional. The plot, especially the 2nd half, is simply absurd. The more you read the more you can smell the stanch from the sewers in Hollywood..
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Love 007 with Daniel Craig, he is a good actor, but why some of the main characters have to die!. Anyway, it was good for me.
0136879721|5.0|I read this book back in 1965. The material was far ahead of its time. Many of our current celebrity guru's are restating what Murphy wrote in 1964. Beware!  I purchased two other books that 'appeared' to be this book but were inferior knock-offs. Buy this book with the exact ISBN number.
6304711905|5.0|VAL KILMER MAKES THIS MOVIE.  HIS PORTRAYAL OF DOC IS VERY ENTERTAINING. A WESTERN WE CAN WATCH  OVER AND OVER.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This is a great movie if you like guitars and blues music with a little story-telling thrown in. Bought this for my sister's kids, they liked it :o)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I am still undecided about this app. I haven't tried all the games but the few I have played were kind of fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A weather app that actually tells you the weather!!<br />I couldnt ask for more info, gives you every thing you need.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I think Angry Birds is a great way to get some anger out after a tough day. My 6 year old grandson likes to play it too.
B0087IT8LO|4.0|Loved the movie in the theater and I have watched it 3 times already!  The acting is perfect and the score wonderful.  It's one of those perfect movies that is moving and yet has laughs and great characters.  Highly reccommended!  (blue-ray version is clear and crisp.)
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this and there seems to be a lot of different deals and play options available. A lot of fun.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|I listen to this soundtrack all the time in my car - a nice variety of classical music R&B, jazz and even dance music.  Reminds me of the movie's great scenes but even passengers who have not seen the movie comment on how nice a score it is.
B00881VLCE|2.0|This was fun until you solved all of the puzzles then it wasn't. Not very many puzzles to start with.
B000QCQ8XA|4.0|I discovered Jonathan Tropper when I read This Is Where I Leave You.  Both books were as insightful and very funny..  I don't know which I liked better.  Read them both!
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|This is a different way to play a game. My 6 year old Grandson got pretty frustrated with it and has only played it the 1 time.
B0015KGWZG|4.0|I had read this book long ago and felt like it was life-changing.  I recently picked it up for my kindle and started reading it again.  Many of the truths in the book are already habit from my first encounter - but I'm finding lots of concepts that are well worth thinking hard about and finding ways to implement them in my life.  Never a victim - always growing.  I am Christian and do have to temper the message of self-reliance just a smidge to recognize the role God plays in my life - but that's easy enough to do.  Thanks, Dr. Wayne!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I took this game off of my kindle, it was hard to see the tiles and not very easy to play.
B000EUDAWG|2.0|Mildly cheap toy, good for a scare or two as long as you don't you the motor function.  Very loud, and only goes forward and turns right with it's too button controller.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game, both my 6 year old grandson and I play it often. It is a great stress reliever!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie got great reviews and it deserved them all! At and during and after the ship wreck was sad and exciting with a great twist at the end - Very good movie.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is pretty fun if you don't get too frustrated in the upper levels. I don't really play it too much.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|The family all loved this movie - The movie is a collection of several of their different performances combined into one theme making it appear as one performance - Done very well
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Trying to get up levels is keeping me up at night. The only draw back is you only get 5 lives.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|My wife got me hooked on The Doctor and I love it.  We watch it every night.  Really good story lines and it lots of fun to watch.  Anticipation of hwo The Doctor will overcome is part of the experience.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Inspirational!  Adam Brown was a great dude!  So many of the books about Spec Ops on the market now days are about chest pounding.  Fearless is not!  It is easily one of my favorite reads! Great Book!  You will not regret purchasing this book!
B00B9366VO|4.0|This movie carried me through many of my faves from classic rock through grunge. Who knew one device could - literally - set the tone for whole generations of music. Looking forward to purchasing the soundtrack!
B005CVWWJY|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect of this book when I started it and it was probably oriented towards a younger audience. I still did enjoy reading it for the most part even if some of the simplistic themes made me less invested in the story. For younger readers I think it's a good introduction to cyberpunk as something like William Gibson is quite difficult to read.
B00377V2M8|5.0|As a music lover, who wouldn't want to see these 3 together talking the history of music, their own influences, and how they &#34;made it big&#34;. And Jimmy Page just became even more endearing than ever!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of suspense, great plot and character development.....excellent writing. Second half, definitely kicks into gear. I agree with many, that the ending was disappointing. The author gets the reader all revved up for a dramatic ending and then blah! However, I feel it was within the author's purview to make this choice and I am grateful for the good read. It was definitely an amazing and crazy ride. Beware of graphic foul language if that offends you. Great book club read!
B004N0I3U2|4.0|I used to not really like Pierce Brosnan as 007, I always preferred Roger Moore, however now that it's been several years I really do appreciate this PB rendition and I have that good old nostalgic feeling about it. It's part of my Classic 007 List now in my book. I still prefer Roger Moore :) but PB was pretty great too.
1469265532|5.0|Knowing my father is losing his eyesight and was an avid reader, I tried to find other ways for him to enjoy reading.  Finding authors who provide audio CD's was just what he needed.  My dad states Michael Connelly is one of his favorite authors!<br />I highly recommend audio book formats to other with limited eyesight!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I read the book a long time ago as a kid in school and really enjoyed it. Since it's been so long since I've read it, I don't remember how true to the book this movie is, but the movie was very entertaining and well done. I've seen Peter Jackson's other LTR trilogies and enjoyed them as well. But for some reason, I like this one better, probably because &#34;The Hobbit,&#34; as it was written by Tolkien, was was a bit more humorous than his LTR trilogies.
B00000255F|5.0|CD came in great/new shape.<br />I've only recently started \\"getting\\" Bruce's music. I've heard it for years, but now it's speaking to me. This CD is my third of Bruce's and is a rock classic. I'm very glad I bought it!
B004S82OAE|4.0|This is a good book for getting your CCNA.  i would recommend getting the physical book so that you can get the CD and copy the pages with the tests for practice.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|I first knew about Glen Hansard years ago and then somehow misplaced him along the way. I recently bought several of his CDs and this one captures the poetic qualities and the subtle harmonies that remind me of the influences of his music and what I love about him. His narrative is not lost in its perfect musical vessel. My heart breaks for his loss but he isn't ever writhing in depression and despair. He's trying again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play this game. Take this with me to all appointments. Helps keep time from crawling when you have to just sit and wait for who knows how long.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. I love how the writer puts you in the story...I am so excited to read the next book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is such an amazing game. I love the challenges they give us and the characters featured. If you have subway surfers then you should also try this out. Otherwise it's really great.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I disliked this novel intensely.  There was no redeeming aspect to it.  The author continually led me down to a dead end or to an abrupt change in narrative and in actions taken by characters.  Nick and Amy were not consistently portrayed.  She had what is called a Borderline personality......narcnn
B001OL4TR4|5.0|I wish they would make more movies like this in a medieval vein.  Rutgar Hauer is so handsome and Michelle Pfeiffer is so beautiful,  Mathew Broderick is such a lovable rascal and there is a fabulous villain.  The story is classic star crossed lovers but with a really nice twist in the end. Worth it even though it has a really inappropriate modern soundtrack.
B00000099X|5.0|Received in good condition. The album art rocks. The vinyls are transparent orange with sacred geometry in the middle. Overall fantastic album.
1878424319|5.0|IT WAS BRAND NEW AND I GOT IT FOR IKE $12, IT TEACHES YOU MANY LIFE LESSONS AND WAYS TO LOOK AT THE LEMONS THAT LIFE THROWS YOU.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|I love this game another great game well done. I play on my kindle fire hd. A fun way to learn of art work and have a fun hidden object game rolled into one. To get the full game was $1.99 worth the money. A most have game. Happy gaming everyone.  =^..^=
B007Y2W44W|4.0|Good music, I like the album.  I like all of their albums.  They are a great band.  Fast and technical.
B004TI5N38|5.0|What's not to like with any Baldacci novel (except maybe the price).  Always keeps you reading and wanting more with great characters, story development and conclusions.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|I loved this.  It was well made, and so was the second one.  I will watch them again.  I recommend this and the second one.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game.<br /><br />Kind of more of the same, however since the same is fun....<br /><br />Great for killing time!<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you travel a lot or have kids that need temporary pacification.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|I loved this.  It was made well, as was the first.  I will watch them again.  I recommend this and the first.
B009AMANBA|5.0|It is seldom that a film reminds the viewer so vividly about history that we have either forgotten or ignored while in school.<br />This gives us a chance to remedy the problem.  It is extremely well acted and produced.  It gives the flavor of a contentious<br />period.  The polarization of the nation and congress exceeds even the childlike approach of today.  It should be required watching<br />for all Americans.
B0041B785Y|4.0|Good music, I like the album.  I like all of their albums.  They are a great band...my favorite.  Fast and technical.
1885167776|2.0|this book is remarkably similar to \\"Eat That Frog\\" by Brian Tracy, 2001. This includes focus on one thing, Parento principle, forced efficiency, focus on results, etc.
B00555X8OA|3.0|Lots of interesting topics. The second half drags a bit, but overall overall it is worth reading reading if you are interested in decision-making.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|Been listening to Mp3 and CD of this album since it was frist came out, I was so happy to find the Vinyl version. And, seriously, I never want to listen to the CD and MP3 again. To feel Adele as she really is, to feel the beauty of her voice and the instruments, you should experience vinyl ;-).
B004G6009U|5.0|Who said they don't make them like they used to.  This is better than some of the they used to movies LOL!  A movie the whole family will love.
B004CJB0CM|2.0|Blu ray quality is really poor and so slow to load, navigate,etc.  I would not purchase again, the dvd is cheaper.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Some of Hollywoods best actors and actresses.  A highly enjoyable movie full of laughs and action.  Bruce Willis really earned his pay.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|Was a very good read, enjoyed the humor, dialog, and flow of the story..Would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys lite reading with humor.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|A very interesting foreign movie for change. Excellent cinematography, great story, touches the heart of all those who struggles to find God!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|One of the best Pixar movies that has been made.  Top 3 easily.  Beautiful movie.  Loved every second of it.
B003IWYOF4|4.0|I grew up with this movie so this will always be highly rated IMO. On the other hand I wish they could of included some sort of a directors cut or extended edition. I know it's possible. The movie &#34;Big&#34; starring Tom Hanks has an extended cut with nearly 30 minutes of added footage. B-
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Death narrates this remarkable story about life during the time of WW11.<br />The character development and plot are mesmerizing.<br />Would recommend this book to youth and adults.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|This movie got so much hype that i was expecting something great. Maybe my expectations were too high, but i really didn't think this was such a great movie. I was really disappointed and felt like i had wasted my time.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The main character, once emancipated from foster care, faced multiple challenges. Finding happiness seemed elusive. Learning the language of flowers brought survival to a troubled young adult.<br />Would recommend this book to all.
1616550414|5.0|Ridiculously underpriced, high quality, hardcover.  A must have for any zelda fan. More info than ever before and official timelines at last.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|it was like you want to be okay,he is the most beautiful thing I was like you want to be okay with that
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I loved the movie so I bought the DVD. The special features were good but I still manage to find special features on youtube that aren't in my DVD.
B005HSL626|5.0|I highly suggest installing this game, first because its free, and second its so addictive you will never want to put it down. I'm sorry to say you should not purchase the full version. It is not much different than the free version. Its a waste of $1. Just install this app and you will be happy. For sure 5 Stars!
B00B22IJXK|5.0|It really works like a charm! I definitely feel like it is the most bang I could get for my buck.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I'd say it was better then book 1, each family keeps you wanting to know more about them and the direction their heading,
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is awesome for me and my granddaughters.  We like playing this game because we can play together or alone.  It is children friendly as well as adult friendly. Purchased free on Amazon.
B00000JQFM|5.0|One of the best instrumentals ever created by one of the worlds best guitarists!<br />When you just want to cruise in the rock mood and don't want singing.<br />Also check out Steve Vai's passion and warfare, they go great together!
B00B22IJXK|3.0|The opening menu, does not display in landscape. Odd,... since, the app seems to recognise and  function properly in landscape; except for the opening menu.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I think the readers of the book should take it seriously since this will be partially true in the far future. If I only have this brain pal. It would be so nice!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Much better than the movie version. . .more story development and suspense!!  And, of course, real romance!  After the first couple of chapters I couldn't put it down.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the musical for more than 20 years and was thrilled to hear that we were finally getting a movie version of it. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Eddie Redamayne and Amanda Seyfried have great voices, but Anne Hathaway steals this movie as Fantiine.<br /><br />The best part is that they were able to be even truer to the original novel than on stage, for instance showing that it was Christmas Eve when ValJean rescues Cosette, The bad part is always that changes have to be made from the stage version and a little of the &#34;magic&#34; seems to be lost in translation.... Personally I prefer musicals to be filmed on stage in a theater...  The acting was amazing in general, though I thought Hugh should have had more of an edge as ValJean. He has a great voice but if they had lowered his part just a little bit it would have sounded much better to me. Same thing with Eddie Redmayne's Marius. Most of his part was sung in falsetto, which is a little tiring to hear after a while. (I'm used to hearing Michael Ball, the original Marius, who is a low tenor...)<br /><br />All in all I enjoy this version a lot and have watched it many times already, but for the theater purists the best version is the Les Mis 10th Anniversary Dream Cast version...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great mystery. . .and edge of my seat excitement toward the end!  I really didn't see this coming until the very last!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very cute story! Loved the sensibility of it all! Quick read! I found myself falling for Connor ... such a loveable character!
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|I enjoyed the cd right away and it just keeps getting better each time I listen to it.<br />The art work on the background insert is an extra bonus.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|Visiting the world of Terrence Malick in many ways must be differentiated from `watching a movie' and that is likely one of the reasons there are so many honest people who love movies who find TO THE WONDER a major disappointment, `a mess', `not a movie' and other responses. That Terrence Malick has a gift of blending film and thought and philosophy and music and silence into a meditation on his views of life, of love, of the human condition is a given. The `story' is nonlinear, given in bits an pieces like the momentary light fireflies offer in Oklahoma nights or the strains of themes from the classical music with which he bathes his quiet moments, themes that begin, echo, go nowhere, and is about those very personal responses to life as it happens to us or as we perceive it has a meaning, a direction, a connection to God.<br /><br />In view of that it seems a bit odd that Magnolia pictures offers a synopsis of the `plot' and that should be shared here: `Neil (Ben Affleck) is an American traveling in Europe who meets and falls in love with Marina (Olga Kurylenko), an Ukrainian divorc&eacute;e who is raising her 10-year-old daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiine) in Paris. The lovers travel to Mont St. Michel, the island abbey off the coast of Normandy, basking in the wonder of their newfound romance. Neil makes a commitment to Marina, inviting her to relocate to his native Oklahoma with Tatiana. He takes a job as an environmental inspector and Marina settles into her new life in America with passion and vigor. After a holding pattern, their relationship cools. Marina finds solace in the company of another exile, the Catholic priest Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who is undergoing a crisis of faith. Work pressures and increasing doubt pull Neil further apart from Marina, who returns to France with Tatiana when her visa expires. Neil reconnects with Jane (Rachel McAdams), an old flame. They fall in love until Neil learns that Marina has fallen on hard times.'<br /><br />It is possible to give each of these basically silent (voice over) characters an interpretation but instead it feels as though Malick is simply watching four people respond to the world as it affects interpersonal relationships. Father Quintana, in his painful sadness at trying to find the light that God once provided him to nurture his fellow man, appears be whispering that the reason for our breakups, for our fragmented lives and relationships, is that we can no longer see God. If we could, we would be whole again. Yet even this concept seems less important than every person in the presence of this film finding his/her own meaning: Malick seems to be providing that privacy, that distancing from making his `characters' fully credible that allows each of them to become part of our own longings and angst and faith that somewhere, sometime this will all make sense - if it is supposed to.<br /><br />The cinematography is provided by Emmanuel Lubezki and the musical score is attributed to Hanan Townsend: there should be mention of the use of themes from classical composers - Wagner's Parsifal themes and Henryk G&oacute;recki's symphonic music being the two most often used. But in the end this is a Terrence Malick meditation, and as such it is the way he combines the images, the light, the locations, the music and the actors to make us ponder.

B00BSBY38A|3.0|LIfe of Pi was not a bad movie to watch but it wasn't the best movie I have ever seen.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I always enjoy historical fiction.  The cruelty of especially the Nazi's is frightening but probably realistic.  In my opinion the romantic interests of the characters is over played.
1439153663|4.0|It is a stark reminder of a time in history that people, especially americans black and white, that would like to bury. The story is very good and captivating, I couldnt put the book down.<br />There wasnt anything i disliked about it, it touched enough on each character. The main characters were interesting and I felt the struggle they endured.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Poor Mark Watney was on a 6 person expedition to Mars that was supposed to last 2 months, but on the 6th day, a strong sand storm, with 175 kph winds, caused them to make an emergency escape. But the storm caused a long antenna to brake off and pierced through Watney's space suit and into his side. He was presumed dead by the crew and left there, as they didn't have time to recover his body before their escape vehicle was destroyed in the storm. This excellent story is how he survived and managed to fend for himself until he could be rescued on the next mission. With 2 months of food and supplies for a crew of 6, he had to make it last for 4 years, when the next expedition was due to arrive. He used his skills as a botanist to farm potatoes, started from a few potatoes that were supposed to be for a Thanksgiving dinner. Since martian soil will not support anything to grow in it, he mixed a small supply of potting soil with it on the floor of the HAB, and the nutrients leached into the Martian soil. The book does get a little dry & tedious sometimes, but he goes into much detail about how he goes about fixing things.He's quite good at building things he needs out of what limited parts he has. The book gets pretty exciting in spots where things don't go exactly as planned, like when he is experimenting with hydrogen and sparks inside the HAB.
0205313426|5.0|A great way to improve or develop your own style, I believe that own style has improved since I have read this book.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This was a fantastic movie.  Edge of your seat the entire time.  Ben Affleck was great..one of his best. Highly recommend it.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This was an incredible story... who would have thought it would have eneded the way it did! Im also a BIG fan of the show! Cant wait for season 2!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|after the first temple run this is a great upgrade.  better graphic not too difficult ,,,, can play over and over again
B005WBBYXO|4.0|I love fantasy's in other worlds.  It's great to see a vision of how we could live if only some events did or didn't happen in ours.  My only disappointment was toward the end in the 3rd book when I thought there was too much story around other characters rather than the girl I've been reading about.  I would like to have read more about their life after the end, but I guess that's for another book?
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Solid watch at a great price.  I wasn't crazy about the band so I replaced it with a Chums wide band.  This is my everyday beater watch so I am considering buying another Seiko 5 with the metal band for business.  I've had the watch a few weeks now and have had zero problems.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|it is quiet and big  i very like this, but not very helpful.. i cant not feel the heat from the cpu . i mean I don't know how it is thermal conductivity.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I love the books and the movie, even though some bits are missing that were in the book!  And, btw, I am not a teenager.  I am a grown woman, with teenage children!
B006RXPUR2|5.0|This movie did not get enough attention! It is super underrated with superb acting, and a great story line. There are plenty of twist to keep you guessing.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this is an intence game ive been looking for a new kinds heal like game to play since I beat all the levels. of heels star.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I really like this movie and the build up to the climax at the end is worth the wait. They do a good job developing characters and telling the story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|do you know I have dreams of horses?well, you know now so I'm a horse person. I read my pony pal books called the wild pony, what's wrong with my pony and he's my pony. I just need the first book of the pony pal series to find out where pam meat anna ans lulu. did you read the pony pal series or not
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Lives up to the hype that has ever been uttered about his movie, just when I think Ben Affleck couldn't be any dumber he goes and makes a movie like this... and totally redeems himself!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book disappointed me, especially when compared to the movie. The plot in the book never really brings various elements of the story-line together in a satisfying way for the reader. Also, aside from Pat, the rest of the characters receive less than adequate characterization. Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany in the movie bears little resemblance to the Tiffany in the books. Most of all, the tone of voice  the author gave to Pat did not seem to do justice to all that those who are dealing with a mental illness must go through. Pat's character struck me as sounding too childish as he grappled with his situation. It's a decent story, but the movie was much better!
B002722R64|3.0|This is probably the only Pierce Brosnan James Bond movie that I like, I guess it was unique for its time but after the new Bond movies and movies like the Bourne series these old James Bond movies just don't cut the cake when it comes to Womanizing assassin.
B00B7FOQCK|1.0|I recently purchased an Acer Iconia w700 windows 8 tablet.  I purchased the USB hub for the tablet when I am using it without the docking station but need more than the one USB 3.0 port.  I thought this would be perfect.  Problem is it doesn't work with my wireless mouse (USB 2.0) and sometimes - not always - it won't work with my new 500Gb WD Passport portable HD.  It is intermittent so I'm not sure what the deal is there.  The biggest beef is the wireless mouse.  It works great with the docking station but not the hub.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Kept you wanting more, there was never a dull moment.  Made you want to believe in fairy tales and that dreams do come true.
B002C949KE|5.0|Dan Ariely writes a wonderful book to read. There is a lot to learn from this book. If you are looking for some fascinating facts about our irrationality than this is the book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 1 ended with you wanting to know more.  This one didn't disappoint and this also leaves you with wanting to know more about them.
B00AYJBT66|5.0|Another super sounding reissue.I am fortunate to own a UK Track original mono. To me this has always sounded bass shy and dynamically constrained and this reissue confirms this to be the case. The bass is taut and extended and the dynamics much enhanced all of which gives the album greater immediacy and impact. Yes it is not essential like Experianced but at this price totally recommendable.
0375850864|4.0|A remarkable and rather shocking mystery set in 1978-79, this book is impossible to put down.  Vivid characters and real-life problems (for the most part) make this a wonderful story.<br />  Miranda is a sixth grader, living in New York City.  Her mother is a single mom, who loves her daughter but seems to be somewhat preoccupied with her own life.<br />  As long as she can remember, Miranda has been best friends with the neighbor boy, Sal, who also lives in a single-parent home.  In fact, most of the children in this book come from broken families.  This does not seem to be meant to help children heal, but merely to normalize having only one parent around.<br />  If you read this book, you will think about time in a whole new way.  I like things that make me think hard, or make me see things differently than I have before, so I loved this book.<br />  This mystery is so shocking, it is hard to understand at first.  It takes a while to fully comprehend what happens.  Characters that seem completely unimportant are keys to unlocking the mystery, while other characters, main characters, are totally oblivious what is happening around them.<br />  Of course, there are a few things I dislike, but I think for certain ages they are overlookable.  The first is that the author is an evolutionist.  The second is that she shoves in romance where there should be none.  In my experience, sixth graders do not kiss, and boys that age are not the least bit interested in girls.  Twelve is way too young for that.(This is supposed to be ages 8 and up, but I think it should be classified as a young adult book).<br />  Despite those few things, I loved this book.  It makes me hungry for more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is incredible. everyone. should get this app. its the best app I hav ever had if u could rate it 100 stars I would totally. rate it 100000000000000 stars cause its so awesome.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Amazing show, I think the following its built speaks for itself and this blu ray is a way to relive the season that started it all.
B000S56U42|3.0|Never get to much of Tina.  I have not seen to much of Tina in the last few years but used to go to her concerts years ago and really miss those now.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|I enjoyed 3 days of the Condor. Good story, great action, not too bloody. It was very well done Redford and Dunnaway worked well together.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I love the story ,complete with a strong ,brave,intelligent young lady who stands up for what is right. Yet takes no Bull
B006LSZECO|3.0|After all the talk, thought this book would be better.  It simply ended in a very unsatisfying way which was too bad because I was enjoying the book up to that point, first rooting for one then the other.
B0031QVW2U|4.0|Awkward to grab and snap together.  I found I have to position the strap where I can connect it to the front snap and then rotate it around.  However, with that said, it does a fine job of keeping the strap from sliding back and forth as I move the camera up to shoot and then back down by my side.
0060987464|5.0|Amazing book! This was one of those books I couldn't put down for a second. I'd read it at work, in the bathroom, before bed. Very entertaining read. Gave it to a fellow musician to pay it forward.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Big fan of George R.R. Martin a couple of little things though, the dragons, while far more abundant than in any of the books, were only in maybe 5% of the book not enough to name the book after. Also absolutely nothing happened with The Others. Other then that (and one particular event that actually ruined the rest of my day after I read it) the book was yet another incredibly addition to the series. I just hope The Winds of Winter comes out soon
0393314804|5.0|Almost didn't get this book because I was afraid I'd have a headache of a time reading a book written in Scots. Since I loved the movie so much, I decided to give it a go and it actually wasn't a tough to read at all! In fact, it was quite refreshing to read something written in a totally different dialect/style. Trainspotting was an entertaining insight to all the backstory the movie didn't include. It was also fun to read different chapters in the perspective of different characters (unlike the movie, Renton's perspective only). Reminded me a little bit of the book Requiem for a Dream, since it was written as it's spoken (phonetically) and the perspective changes (but I have to say I prefer Trainspotting 1,000,000,000 times over).<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone with an appreciation for colorful vocabulary (major understatement) and VERY colorful characters! Your mind will be stuck swearing and speaking in a Scottish accent for weeks. I will be Porno as soon as I finish the last chapter of Trainspotting tomorrow! I look forward (with Porno) to having the perspective of reading the book before watching the film this time!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, griping, and with well written characters. Keeps you wanting to read one more chapter to find out what happens next!
B004D7GU3M|5.0|This album is great, probably Kanye's best (hard to decide if its this or Graduation). The vinyl comes with lots of cool extras like posters and changeable front display artwork. I waited till it went on sale for $25ish. Very happy with the purchase
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Show fantastic, buying was fast and easy, really wish i could watch it on my ipad, not just my sons laptop
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the Walking Dead and season 3 is no disappointment in the series. Can't wait for season four to come.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this is amazing its way better than the first one and its free! you have to get this there is more hero's to play with and a Multics player feature amazing buy this :D
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Yup, that's right, never been a Madonna fan. I'm a big Kylie (Minogue) fan here. Now, I'm no Madonna hater, I've always thought Madonna's hits were catchy, but just was never a fan and never bought any of her albums. So why do I give this DVD 5 stars? I collect music DVD's of female artists, even those I'm not a fan of. If I find there music catchy, I'll get it. Because I never followed Madonna's music I never knew this DVD existed since 2009. Because of this DVD, I didn't have to go and purchase multiple DVD's to get all her video's. Ignore the bad reviews on here of people complaining bad picture, bad sound, bad this, bad that, censored version this, censored version that. People can be so picky about the littlest things, the picture on this is very watchable, and the 5.1 surround is awesome! This DVD is 5 stars all the way for packing 47 of Madonna's biggest hits in one DVD!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I am unimpressed with this offering in the series.  It is simply old levels on a new platform with IAP. This is not worth the price-especially with the added cost for the end of the game. I can understand freemium but this is too much, especially considering the removal of purchasing stuff with the &quot;currency&quot;, Ollars, and the replacement of this with MORE IAP.  Don't buy this unless you want to spend 5 more dollars on unlocking things.
B000H30B2C|5.0|I got this movie for my 4 year old son who is obsessed with dinosaurs,, and when he found out that there were t-rex's in this movie he wanted to see it.  It really is an interesting movie, it held my attention too.  I would recommend seeing it

B00136RXGY|5.0|I had heard Diva years ago but wasn't motivated to make the purchase until I heard the album at a friend's party a week ago.<br /><br />In listening to the music with headphones after my purchase...I was transported. I could listen to Annie Lennox sing forever.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This book was a little disappointing :(  I thought it would be a great read but it lacked length and suspense.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|What can I say, it's The Piano Guys.  This CD has most of the music from the RED BUTTE concert that was on PBS; and so makes for great listening.  The only drawback is that the video is missing.  But if you did see the special on PBS, this is a great way to relive it.
B000EPE7AK|5.0|I actually bought this to replace a scratched copy i have. Because my little granddaughter loves it I bought two. One for me to keep in my car and one for her Easter basket. Delivery was fast and price was good.

B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I actually really liked this film. Not formulaic, and while the characters weren't always likable, I could see bits of them in people and relationships that I know. If you are looking for a feel-good romantic comedy-type-thing, this isn't it. But, I really found it enjoyable, and laughed out loud more than once.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was great reading....fun, exciting, suspenseful.  It was a little different from the usual read, a wonderful adventure. What what?
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Very good movie.  I have seen it on the big screen and wanted the DVD for my library.  Would recommend it to others.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is not exsactly great literature.  Sensationalism doesn't exactly work for me.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|He is a good thinker and writer.He gives plenty of examples and images.I think everybody in the world should read this book!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Not as good as the movie..  I was actually in a hurry to finish reading it. I am not interesated in football.

B003VWU2WA|3.0|- not possible to disable bright obnoxiously blinding LED-light at the base of the device. There is a way if you use MacOSX, but even then it is a LONG hassle. Horrible design.<br />- not possible to control volume in separate applications<br />- wired. it's 2013, seriously?
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Story line a little thin to point of being boring at times. Good action scenes and thd photography had many special moments. Lot of footage with no dialog made the movie drag at times. Worth a nod time watch.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Who doesn't love a good princess movie?  I mean, if you have children, or more specifically if you have daughters, then princess movies circulate your DVD player on an almost constant, and so you really do hope and pray and a good one comes along.  There are so many of them.  Pixar, the same studio behind great animated films like `Up' and `Toy Story' has never ventured into princess territory, and so when `Brave' was announced the internet (and every attentive parent) got their hopes up for this to actually be something special.<br /><br />In parts, this really is, but in other parts it is kind of the same.<br /><br />I think where `Brave' differs from almost every single other princess movie is that the protagonist is actually fighting AGAINST the idea of finding a prince charming.  It may have a lot to do with what she is offered (laughable at best) but the idea that she is more of a tomboy seeking her right to be herself and express herself freely, and without tradition barking in her ear, is a nice touch.  It's not like that same sentiment hasn't been expressed before.  Disney films like `Pocahontas' and `Mulan' display similarly strong-willed women fighting against the traditions of their people, but `Brave' takes it a step further by eliminating the desire to find Mr. Right.  Sadly, the overall construction of `Brave' doesn't steer too far from the set course.  It follows a similar story outline and so, by the time the film has ended, it does feel like an exercise in the same.<br /><br />The visuals are lush, and the moral of communication and compromise are nice assets to the films progression.  Folklore is such a fun and spirited way of telling a story, although I will say that many of the films plot points felt a tad lazy in construction.  Really, another witch?  Another potion?  Can't we do better than that?  The film is heartwarming and presents a meaningful message, especially for families since it stresses the importance of realty listening to one another.<br /><br />At the end of the day, my daughters love this (obviously) but I'm not entirely sold on the finished product.  Maybe it's because I expected more from the same studio that found such inspired ways to address so many mature themes (growing up via `Toy Story 3', mourning and loss via `Up', parenthood and balance via `Finding Nemo').  I wanted this to be something special, something amazing.  It was good, but lacked greatness.her.<br /><br />At the end of the day, my daughters love this (obviously) but I'm not entirely sold on the finished product.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|After Letter From Your Last Lover, I sought out works by this author and read this next.  I am not a reader who lets emotions get toyed with by authors (and yet sniffles at sentimental commercials with sappy music, go figure), but I was so drawn to these characters, so taken by their little microcosm of a world tucked away, I forgot what I was doing.  Literally.  As in maybe kinda sorta forgot to make dinner for the family it was so hard to stop reading.  Before I knew it, multiple genuine emotions were bubbling to the surface--giddiness, empathy, despair.  And I never felt manipulated, even though I did sense where I might be going.  This is a Good book.  Read it.  Talk about it with a friend that reads it because you encouraged them to the book.  I used to be part of a book club years and a couple kids ago.  This would be a worthy book club choice.  Plus, if you dressed in costume as the main female character....hilarious.  She's got a pair.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game. It is easy to play while watching TV. Now I don't have to sit at my computer to play it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great romance,leaving you wanting more. I cannot wait to read the continuing story of Eva and Gideon. It should really be hot and interesting.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I kept reading about how people would plug their medium quality headphones into one of these little amps and get outstanding results. I figured I would do the same! I have a pair of Sennheiser HD 558's which sound extremely nice off my big home amp, or my PC with a sound card. On my laptop they were lacking any power, so I bought the E6 amp.<br /><br />The volume and clarity was boosted noticeably, but after a few weeks of use I started to notice some things. I have very sensitive ears (remember the old CRT TVs? The high pitch whine they make is very painful to me.) Well, it seems that when the E6 is charging and I'm listening to it, it occasionally makes an extremely high (higher than the TV) pitch screech. It is very quiet, I only really notice it as pain because it is so hard to hear. If I pause the music it continues to gain screech volume, perhaps near full charge. It might be some circuitry that regulates charge voltage.<br /><br />Other than that... this thing is great! It boosts the quality of my laptop (and phone) output, and I really like the equalizer settings (blue is my favorite). A good little piece of gear, but sometimes I wonder if it's worth the occasional pain.
B005RYF5JA|4.0|I have most of Celtic Women DVD's and CD's. Their &#34;Songs From the Heart&#34; is a notch above this DVD, but enjoyed both.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I read this book in 2 days it usually takes me 2wk's to finish a book. I highly suggest reading this.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Much easier to use than the clock feature on my phone. I like the ability to assign different tones for the alarm so that i know when something is IMPORTANT or I can &#34;snooze&#34; through. I have used this product for about six months now.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have read this book multiple times ans it still gets me every time. I can honestly say I like this series more than 50 shades book.

B009R659L8|5.0|Very enjoyable fast moving book.  Mary Higgins Clark never disappoints.  All of her books keep you interested right from the beginning.  Looking forward to her next book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had a Kindle.  Then I got an Android tablet.  I figured I didn't need both so I sold the Kindle and deregistered it.  Once I'd done that I couldn't access my books on my Android anymore.  I talked with Amazon Kindle tech support.  They were unable to find a solution.  One tech even told me that my tablet and Kindle were not compatible and there was nothing I could do.  But I went on Amazon on my Android and downloaded the Kindle for Android app and everything works beautifully!  And I figured it out all on my own!  I love having my books in color!  I haven't run into any glitches yet.  Happy, happy girl!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book it was amazing Twilight is my LIFE FOREVER!!!!!  Now it's time for the graphic novels I read the first now here come the second book in a graphic novel
1400097029|4.0|I just finished listening to this volume on audiobook.  It's very language- and idea-driven, with a rather sparse, meandering plot.  I'm not sure I would have had the interest or patience to read it, but it was absolutely lovely to listen to, with the narrator's Irish accent adding an extra dimension to the beautiful writing.  There are many phrases, passages, and ideas one can really savor, and I can highly recommend this as a listening experience.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love this game  when I was looking for some new apps I saw it and I got it.I think it is really fun and people should really get this app.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very well written, takes the reader into the heat of battle and gives a unique perspective into the lives of some very heroic men who are examples of the best of mankind during the worst of times.
B004478AS4|5.0|Cultures can be destroyed just like a species.  The vanity that your beliefs are superior and must be inflicted on all others is endemic in mankind to the present day.  This book is still timely.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I'm a fool for historical series such as Rome and am absolutely entranced by Vikings.  The story line is engaging, but the real treat is  the visuals- absolutely gorgeous!
B004NELBPC|2.0|Cannot believe latest update. Used to read every night at bedtime. No more. Going to delete this appp until your too-much-time-on-their-hands programmers change it back.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love anykind of solitarie game.  This one was free and I play every chance I get.<br />Would recommend to any Solitaire enthusiast
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Now I can't wait to see the movie.  Oddly, it is nice reading a book before you've seen the movie but after you know who are playing the main characters.  You can stick them right in there.
B0064MGU98|4.0|You understand this character, but you sure wish she would get a little spine. The plot does yo yo a little, but overall is still very entertaining.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun game.  Very easy game to play.  You can still do a lot of things without spending any &quot;real&quot; money.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game got me hooked in an instant it is such an interesting story and I couldn't look away from it.The story is totally different then any other I found myself playing it again and again. I am sure you won't be able to get enough of this game the minute you play. What an extraordinary game! Just buy and enjoy!
B00BF11STU|3.0|after all of the hype and build up I thought the movie lacked intrigue and action.  The movie could have been condensed to 1 1/2 hours and nothing of importance would have been left out
B008XG1X18|4.0|I absolutely love Pinterest, it's great. But I am having difficulties with the app crashing over and over again. I just do not have the patience for it. Otherwise, it's da s***. But not the phecal matter, da good s***.
B001EX81ZI|4.0|Met my expectations.<br />If this is want to want you will be satisfied.<br />Item just as described. It is just what it is .
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie is a must see!!!!! My wife and I absolutely love this movie and would recommend it to everyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had me staying up late at night reading. This book took unexpected twists and turns. I must say I hated the ending.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|A wonderful and captivating novel. I am a huge fan of Ian McEwan. This novel as everything, mystery, romance, the McEwan twist and suspense. The literature level is intellectual and fun.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|It isn't as much that I don't like the product but more that it did not fix the problem. When I spoke to someone from customer service, that was what was recommended. The problem is not with the cord but with the connection to the device.
B00AXVIBKW|4.0|I have been listening to Bad Religion for the last 20 years and I think this is one of the better Bad Religion Albums.  It is a lot harder than most of their recent albums and the title track is among the best songs they have ever put out.  If you are a fan then this is a must buy.  If you like punk music then I would also recommend it as it is probably one of the better punk albums in the last 5 years.<br /><br />If you are not into punk then I would stay away, this is more for the fans.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This is a well crafted story with good special effects. For a change the monsters are complex and not entirely unsympathetic. I gave them an extra star for avoiding the tiresome back story that afflicts most such films. Some reviewers have compared it unfavorably to Spielberg's War of the Worlds, but I liked it better. Not as big and impressive to look at, but the characters are much more likable.
B005K2YRVG|3.0|Although I am happy with this case, it isn't anything special.  I bought this case because i needed something to protect my Kindle but wasn't happy with the price of the amazon case and also found that the cases with flip covers tend to add a lot of bulk to the device.  What I like about this case is that I am able to use my kindle without the added bulk of a snap on case while still having my kindle protected when it is in my bag.  The case itself doesn't feel as protective as I would want.  I feel that the kindle could still get damaged it there was a hard impact against it, but that is probably true of the other cases you would buy.<br /><br />Overall this case is worth the price, but it isn't anything special.

B009X01C64|4.0|This is just what I was looking for in a cover for my Kindle. I like that it can prop my Kindle up, making it easier to read hands-free.

B008JGSM6G|3.0|This is a fun and challenging game.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems to have trouble painting the screen properly on both my Motorola Bionic and my Google Nexus 7. As a result I can rarely play it beyond level 10 before I have to quite.<br /><br />Nice, but buggy.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I missed out getting on the Fringe bandwagon when it first came out, so glad it is available here for me to catch up on.

0385483821|5.0|Well....this is an interesting way to approach life but not my particular cup of tea.  Paranoia can lead to discouragement.
1401938906|3.0|OK, so my first experiment seemed to be a success (at the time I was certain it was).  So I read the next few experiments, including all of the info that precludes those experiments.  The reading is inspiring and the author has new insights that I appreciate.  For the Volkswagon Jetta experiment I changed the specific things that I wanted to notice more.  I did not select anything unrealistic, in fact, I chose something that randomly happens to me in life.  I just wanted to see it happen more often in my 48 hours.  I was fired up for this experiment, as the first one seemed to work so well.  Day one...nothing.  Day two...nothing.  I would have settled for even just once and given the experiment some credibility, but what do you do when it just doesn't work.  And I was much more certain of a positive outcome for this experiment.  I even did some releasing steps from one of the other authors I have read, but again, nothing.  I find this disturbing and frightening, as I truly want to believe in the law of attraction and manifestation.  But what do you do when you follow the steps and it just doesn't happen? I will continue with the experiments and update both my review and my rating as this progresses.  I welcome any and all feedback and suggestions, although hopefully any given will be constructive. Below is most of the content of my first review, when the experiment seemed to work:<br /><br />I have just completed the first experiment.  It allows 48 hours for a blessing/gift/sign from the universe that this stuff is real.  I want to believe and yet am skeptical, and I have also been reading \\"The Attraction Distraction: Why the Law of Attraction Isn't Working for You and How to Get Results - Finally!\\" on how to release my underlying resistance.  Well, as time was drawing near and I was already rehearsing my \\"gee I wish this had worked\\" review, I meandered into a synchronicitous event that that I do not believe could be attributed to coincidence.<br /><br />A few caveats:  I am also reading Jane Roberts' book \\"The Nature of Personal Reality: Specific, Practical Techniques for Solving Everyday Problems and Enriching the Life You Know (A Seth Book)\\" and highly recommend it.  Seth teaches these very same principles and gives a more intimate understanding of how we create our realities.  I have read the book \\"How to Become a God for Beginners\\" by Roberto Benitez.  One of his principles is that after setting your intentions manifestation benefits by then focusing on living in the moment and becoming task oriented.  I think I saw the value of that today when I kept waiting on my sign from the universe while it stayed in hiding, and the minute I forgot about looking for or expecting my sign it suddenly manifested.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|fast paced story, and a timely subject.  Main character is a first-class wise-ass!  tough to put down, so it is a quick read
B009G41CG2|5.0|I like the difficulty of this game and the many choices of tile patterns. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Mahjong.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|yes, this is a new way for me to listen, not read as my eye's are in bad need of glasses.<br /><br />I like the sound of the person who reads it. And how I can get an location when I'm listening to  book,<br /><br />when i'm lost or forget my place the kindle tells me where I am.<br /><br />  So I am grateful I have this choice on how to listen to books, and I will get more as I go. I really like<br /><br />this &#34;FIFTY SHADES OF GREY&#34; a very interesting tale. Can not wait until I can get the next sequel  to<br /><br />this book. thanks for the chance to write my review.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This is the second cable.....  like it a lot & hope nothing else goes wrong.  In the end, these are all electrical glitches.....given the great device, we can live w/ these little snags.

076115678X|5.0|I bought this book because Im a straighted haired mom to a super curly daughter, this has helped me SOOO much! Now I can care for her hair the way it needs to be and help her to love her hair as she grows up.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is a gut wrenching story of a brave woman who suffered a lot and found happiness after it. I will recommend this book to anyone who feels lost, insecure, afraid, stressed or going thru a difficult time in their lives. It is uplifting as it is sad and happy. It brought me to tears and I will never forget Cheryl. She reminded me of my own daughter, who never met her father.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book was not what I was expecting. I couldn't get engaged in it. Maybe im just getting sick of zombies. :) But it was worth reading.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is great.  The best part about it is I don't have to sign in to Facebook and try to find 500 people to be my &quot;friend&quot;, although it does give you the option.  It's slow at first but as the game progresses there is lots of missions.  I would have thought I had finished the game a few weeks ago, but it just keeps going.  I'm at level 30 and there aren't any signs of it ending soon.  Also my kids love to look and try to memorize the names of the dinosaurs.  My three year old boy's language skills have really progressed in the couple of months working on the correct pronunciation of them each day. I couldn't be happier with a game that was free.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is the best show! I do not have cable so I had to download all of season 3. It was well worth it.
1475143389|5.0|Amazing book. It really is. Cover to cover, it is loaded with helpful information. Especially the nutrition section. Really opened my eyes up regarding how vital nutrition is to a weight-training program. Not to mention he really helps build your confidence in achieving the goals you lay out for yourself. He even has a chapter that tells you how to set goals! All in all, BEST training book i've read, be it online or paperback. Mike's also amazing at responding to every one and answering any questions you may have. And I mean EVERYONE. I've noticed he answers every question on his website in a helpful manner. So glad to have found this.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|One of my favorite shows  for this year!  There is so much thought and work in the design ... Love the costume, hair , locations, weaponry, ...really all of the background work as well as the character development.  The historic edge  (sounds like the Icelandic Sagas) is the icing on the cake!  Hope you keep up the good work.... Would like to see this one stick around for a few seasons.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My daughter & I love this video. (she is three) The movie is great. The music is wonderfully done! I would recommend this to anyone with young girls!
B009MO57H6|3.0|This film started with an odd way of rehashing the finale of the previous film, run it in reverse then forward again.  Point?  There is no point; this movie is just one long fight sequence.  Project Alice, as she is now known, is just a piece of hardware, hardwired to demolish.  Milla Jovovich doesn't even bother with the pretense of shading her character with depth.  She's no longer a mystery.  Except for a paycheck, I can see no reason for her to continue with this series, it certainly does little to prove she can act.  I'm not even certain she's not entirely CGI!  That said, I do have every installment in this series although the last few have started showing their wear.  As with the previous installment, this one also ends at a crucial point, setting up the inevitable sequel (which Jovovich has stated will be her last).<br />If I were asked to explain the plot, I'm not certain I could.  There's scant dialog and a confusion of settings involving playgrounds for the Umbrella Corporation to test.......things or thingies.  The Red Queen is behind everything (why someone doesn't just pull the plug on her is anyone's guess.  A lack of technology would soon put an end to her reign of terror).  As an added novelty, they dragged back some former characters/actors.  Rather than adding to the story, these people only served to confound things further.  It felt like they were only there for branding purposes, few had much to do other than shoot at someone else.  It was rather tedious towards the end with a typical fight sequence challenging poor Alice until she finally finally finally rallies.<br /><br />Did I enjoy watching this movie?  Not particularly.  But I'm still keeping it with the set.  To get me interested in the next one though, they are going to have to do a whole lot better than this.  At this point, I'm surprised this series has produced this many installments.  The first is still my stand-alone favorite.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am head over heels in love with Aloysius Pendergast.  Read all 13 books in 2.5 months.  Why no more movies????
B008H6GHL0|5.0|I'm genuinely surprised, this movie was quite good, certainly better than most of its live action counterparts.  The artwork is especially impressive, making me forget at times that this is a computer-generated project.  The story was involved, the characters fleshed out, the action wild.  Love the giants and various other monsters.  The people behind this should be very proud of themselves, they accomplished something that Resident Evil: Retribution couldn't.....provide first class entertainment.  I hope they continue making this separate series, I've got the first one and would certainly go for more.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I love the automatic photo upload and seeing my photos on all of my devices!<br />I just wish it would automatically save videos too.

0345528581|1.0|What a complete and total waste of money.  The workouts in this book are basically meant for people who are in hotels all week long.  If I did this workout with my inside doors and handles they would eventually give way.  I could not have been more disappointed with this book. WASTE OF MONEY. There are way better books out there!!!
B00A8KJK7G|3.0|It had it's moments... It could have ben funnier! I probably set my expectations to high to begin with since it was done by a director/actor that I like...

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Had problem with charging cord and took over 12 hrs for Kindle fire to re-charge.  New cord fixed problem immediately.  Charges in less than 2 hrs now.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I play until I cannot stand anymore and I did not think I would like Angry Birds, thanks! I keep coming back!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love watching this television show. I was very happy to see Amazon offered this series.  Everbody should watch The Walking Dead.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have become addict to Angry Birds and Love to achieve more awards and levels and kill those little pigs!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This has become one of the first picks when any of the grand-kids gets the Kindle. It occupies them (i.e.keeps them entertained) and helps improve their dexterity and timing... which could be helpful in later life! As an adult I don't have quite the patience to play this for long but the younger set really likes it.
B000957O82|5.0|A Old time favorite for me, I am a Will Smith fan along with Eva Mendez, so happy to own this
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Good choice for upper 6 year old kids and adults in rainy days!<br />You're gonna love this crazy little birds!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the first app I put on my tablet and I play it all the time. I've never had any glitches with this game.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Too long, and some words were just uneeded. It was long and boring, maybe it's just me, but terribly written!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|One of the best I have heard.  Pumps me up.  Love mumford and Sons!  Blare it in my car all the time.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. I gave it all five stars because it had action, romance, and bravery. I would let people read it because there is so many shocking stuff in it that you wouldn't guess. The author Rick riordan is a really special writer I think. I also think he should write more percy Jackson series!!!!
B007V65R54|5.0|This book was enjoyable to read and I learned useful analytical skills that have helped me at work. It even helped me understand the weather forecast!
0897502027|5.0|This book is full of Bruce Lee's tachniques, insights, sketches, training methods and techniques and fighting methods.<br /><br />All from his original journals etc<br /><br />Its more than a book ots a complete training program.<br /><br />So grateful I found a copy
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie was great!  As good as the play. Music, scenery, acting.  It has it all.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves music.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|While reading this book ,I, never would have guessed the &#34;bad guy &#34; til I finally read it. Baldacci did it again, kept tuning the page to see what was going to happen next
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|We didn't know much about the movie, but it had been recommended by a couple of people.  It didn't disappoint.  Good performances, good story line.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Every DIVA's dream......let's you get all the dish...all the gossip...all the &#34;oops did I do that&#34; on celebs....Great app for Kindle users!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Very functional FaceBook app. I've tried several and had problems with them all. Finally this became available for the Kindle with good no frills functionality.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I am a new kindle user and wasnt sure what to expect.  This app is a pleasant surprise.  Very convenient and easy to use.  I can access my email just about anywhere!
B002APU580|5.0|I love Jane Austin as an author, and this film portrays the book very well.  There are a couple of changes, but they are to ancillary details and not main plot.  The actors are outstanding in communicating nuances with expressions and emotions.  Even though the language is a little difficult to understand at times, the story line is flawless.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, fully enjoyable.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am a new kindle user and wasnt sure what to expect.  This app was a pleasant surprise.  All the weather you need at a glance.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|I've been looking for this film for a while, and I'm glad I found in on Amazon.  Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams are brilliant in their roles.  I don't know how Robert DeNiro acts in this role so convincingly.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful film with sweetness, sadness, and humor all wrapped into one.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I got so sucked into this show that I watched all of Season 1 in one weekend. If you aren't sure about the whole castles and knights genre, this I feel falls outside the norm of that experience. There is a modest amount of magic and fantasy, but the vast majority of the story is character centric. And in this case, you have multiple families and regions with their own inter-twined dramas making up a diverse plot that does not stagnate. The acting is superb and I find myself always wanting to come back when each episode ends. There is a large amount of gore, especially in Season 1, too much in my opinion. But that lessens as the episodes go on. And a fair amount of full on nudity, so all in all NOT for the kids.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was the perfect gift for a very dear &#34;gal pal&#34;.  I love that all I have to do is get a gift idea and AMAZON comes through for me.  I love that experience has taught me to depend that the item arrives on time or even earlier than expected.  THANK YOU AMAZON...YOU ARE MY &#34;GO TO&#34; SHOPPING PLACE
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I found getting several extras meant my Fire would never run out of battery life! One at home, work and one in my purse!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. It's just like the real thing. I used to have horses of my own. I love this game and I wish there were more games like this. I am still looking for them but I encourage you to get this game and besides it's free. Cant turn down an offer like that. I know I can't. Buy it Buy it Buy it Buy it!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very cute almost real. movements are nice. but you don't j ump with western saddles and quarter horses. would be nice to see more breeds. the wait for energy is not so fun.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great app that keeps me entertained for ages I love the fact it keeps changing g it's theme .Love it xxx
0345410025|5.0|First memory book so not a lot to compare it to, but I CAN say the principles work.<br /><br />I plan to apply them to help and improve my memory, but I bet if you were willing to dedicate yourself fully to them, your memory could be truly amazing.<br /><br />Plan on getting a second Improve memory book so I will have something to compare this to later. :)
B000W93CHC|5.0|Glad I have the hardback to find my  place.  Kindle hops all over the volume.  I have spent one whole charged battery ond day<br />trying to find my place. The bookmarks don't work.  I will be reading on page 241 on a flat surface, not bumping Kindle..just looking<br />at the page/screen.  On its own to page 683..of course I did not have time to bookmark it before the leap... I find Kindle a big pain.<br /><br />And now you ask me about games.  Oh they have been put in there, but we cannot get them to come up to play.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My 8 yr old daughter loves this game and plays it all the time.  You can not beat the price of the game, especially since it was free.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Beyond the sensationalistic erotic scenes there was not much story....unsatisfactory ending; even if the author had already prepared a sequel....
B000IAZ5HK|4.0|I use this for my olive oil Mise en place and short of wanting a slightly faster pour, this is excellent.  It looks good, easy to fill, doesn't drip...  I will keep an eye out for spout to oxidize, but so far I have not had that happen.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|A great movie! Great video quality. I intend to continue making purhases from Amazon. No complaints at all and i am very happy which says alot 'cause i'm very skeptical about ordering products on-line. I used to be more comfortable going into a store so I could be assured at what I was spending my money on. Not any more! I can trust Amazon to send me what i'm expecting.
B00065MDS6|4.0|Lizard is a turning point for King Crimson; while their previous release, In The Wake Of Poseidon, resembles too closely in sound and structure to their debut, Lizard delves into modern jazz territory and re-affirms such conviction by guesting Keith Tippett & members of his jazz band, plus the permanent addition of saxophonist/flutist Mel Collins.<br /><br />Having said that, the band also develops to a greater extend key aspects of their original sound; the progressive suites are elongated and consistent (see title track) and the motif of renaissance-period mysticism & imagery is accentuated by Peter Sinfield's increasingly poetic lyricism and the surreal textures of an additional mellotron and a VCS3 synthesizer (not to mention the neurotic vocal delivery of Gordon Haskell, as opposed to the mild-mannered Greg Lake).<br /><br />[This 30th Anniversary Edition consists of a 24 bit remaster by Fripp himself with upgraded dynamics & a booklet with relevant band-related newspaper articles of the time]
B0071BGOJC|4.0|While I don't think this trilogy is as good as Follett's earlier work (Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, in particular, which were brilliant), it is a very good read.  I thoroughly enjoy the insight into the historical period being covered, with the added drama of the stories of the fictitious characters that he uses to illustrate the times.  While the coincidences of the encounters between his characters that weave their stories together sometimes call for a rather large suspension of disbelief, the overall story is great.
B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowling shows her ability to put forth a new story for a new group of readers.  I really liked this book!
B0074YVW1G|5.0|This is one of the best written books of this genre that I have read for a long time.  Susan Cain uses a powerful combination of personal anecdotes, historical figures and modern research findings to illuminate the experience of introverts in a world that values extrovert qualities for the most part.  She provided valuable insights into my own (introvert) personality, and some very useful practical tips for coping with extrovert demands.  I cannot recommend this highly enough to anyone who is quiet (or introverted), or to extroverts who want to understand the people around them better.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is lots of fun and I can spend hours playing it,  the downside is needing crystals to keep playing.  :(
0061703087|4.0|It is difficult to review a novel of the \\"master\\" without repeating myself, since, whatever the story, all his writings are characterized by the ability of gluing us to the pages until the end and on the other hand by the fact that they explore a new topic, always teaching us something new.<br />It also happens in \\"Prey\\". The topic is nanotechnology and the theme of the scientific experiment that escapes from the hands of those who executes it. This latter issue is certainly not something new, but the point of view from which Crichton decides to tell us the story is very special.<br />Almost the entire novel (except, I believe, one scene), in fact, is told in first person by the husband of the scientist on duty, who for most of the book witnesses strange situations that he does not understand or interprets in the wrong way, thus keeping alive our curiosity, page after page, and by allowing us to find out the facts with him. An approach that helps a complete involvement in the reading.<br />Yet unlike other novels I've read so far, I've \\"just\\" given 4 stars. The reason is perhaps personal: the topic of the swarm of nanoparticles has not impressed me at all. It does not mean that the author hasn't managed it in the best way. Quite the contrary. The swarms, as he describes them, are really scary. But I found it a difficult topic to conceive, especially in respect of the final developments of story, but also the whole part, in which he explains a bit about the frontiers of nanotechnology (information based in part on actual studies confirmed by the bibliography and to which a lot of speculation and fantasy is added) has not won my full interest. Maybe it depends on the fact that nanotechnology, at least in the way it has been presented in this book, did not appear very appealing to me. What missed, in short, as far as I'm concerned, was that part of the fun in the books of Crichton that comes from learning something new, this is because I did not felt involved in the topic, therefore the book didn't leave too much to me after reading it.<br />He, however, remains for me a solid point of reference. I only regret that, once finished reading all of his books, there will not be others anymore.<br /><br />Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of [[ASIN:B00L979374 Red Desert - Point of No Return]]pic, therefore the book didn't leave too much to me after reading it.<br />He, however, remains for me a solid point of reference.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show!  The writing is amazing, the acting is superb, and the production is outstanding!  Am so glad that someone is showing this.  Thank you Amazon...gmwstewart
0553805371|4.0|No doubt Stephen Hawkins is one of the best thinkers of our time.  I was very excited to read this book as I love learning about the universe and why it and we are here.  This book is very good but it is not an easy read.  I found myself having to re-read thing and spend time trying to grasp what is written.  That is not always a bad thing as it forces us to think and expand our thoughts.  I have read other books on quantum theory and multiverse and that book too was very difficult to comprehend.  I find that I have to force myself to focus and think through everything, but that can be fund as well at times.  The idea of multiverse is amazing and is hard for every day people to comprehend.  The book does a good job of trying to explain it all and pushes quantum theory forward as science tries to understand why the universe is hear and the idea that our universe is not alone.  Good read, but be ready for some complex topics.
B002M85TH2|4.0|I love love love this movie.  Imagine my disappointment when about 10 minutes before the end of the movie, it stopped playing and would never restart.  Really?  So, no matter what I tried, I was never able to see the end of the movie.<br /><br />There were several reasons I cancelled my Amazon Prime and this experience can be added to those reasons.  No one wants to pay money to watch movies with the end cut off.  So!!!  The movie was great (what I got to watch of it).  Amazon Prime and streaming Amazon movies?  Awful!!!!
B005779X4U|1.0|The $190 trash can came with a big dent in the side. The packaging wasn't damaged just the item. Returned item.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Great Movie highly recommend it.  A must watch movie, action packed and full of excitement.  Special effects are grea to watch in HD.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|The movie was awesome! Creative, funny, original. The parents were perfect. I love the dance.The only thing the streaming kept skipping.
1579128955|5.0|Our family loves NOVA and when we say Theodore Gray on NOVA, we knew his book on the elements would be worth having.  My fourth grader loves this book and studies it all the time.  The information provided includes the technical aspects as well as the non-technical fun facts.  The photography is great and having pictures of how the element appears in our everyday life is a wonderful way to learn the composition of the things around us.  We love this book and would recommend it to any budding scientist.
B00003CX9W|1.0|After attempting to play the BOTH dvds the product would not play AT ALL. IT was if they were blank disk. I will not buy from supplier again and I may not buy DVDs on Amazon again. I am attempting to return the item.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I've had a good time playing this game.  I really like the time played feature because I know how much time I've spent goofing off
B00C6TUXN2|5.0|Willie is my favorite country singer and song writer. He is still going strong at 80 years. Good selection of oldies but goodies songs for this album. This album will sell well if it gets any play on radio...
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I have fun.playing this game.  a little annoying that you only get 5 lives at a time, but I wont pay real money for in app purchases so I put up with it.  however sometimes those lives disappear!  it happened again this morning.  I played one game, then it hesitated for a few seconds and the rest of my lives were gone.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This story displays hope, faith, love of God, it teaches the principle of seeing light in your heart even though with your eyes all you see is darkness.  Pi the main character of the story teaches that the very person or whatever it may be that is your obstacle or mountain to overcome in life, can be the very thing that challenges you to grow in spirit and character to do amazing things you never believe you had the potential to do.  For Pi his challenge was Richard Parker the tiger, at the beginning of the ship wreck Pi was in fear of the tiger and had no hope of living a day at sea with a tiger but the irony of the story is that at the end of the story Pi actually thanked Richard Parker for saving his life, for making him fight to survive and giving him purpose at sea.  What a great story!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The very fact that the characters actually sang and were recorded live with the raw audio of their own voices lent a power to the movie that surprised me. the sets were stunning and costumes vivid..
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I was disappointed when I heard this movie would be split into 3 parts. But after seeing The Hobbit, I'm really glad they did it. The history of the Ring, and Middle Earth was broadened, the effects are marvelous, and  casting was very well done. I haven't watched the extra content on the 2nd disk yet, so can't make any comment on that. Again, they departed from the actual plot of the book a small amount, but only dedicated readers of the original book like me would notice the difference. The only quibble I had was with the computer graphics, the wargs and orcs were almost surreal, they moved so seamlessly, and Gollum, with his big eyes, during the Bilbo pity scene reminded me of the Rapunzel character in Tangled. But over all, the movie was wonderful and I can't wait 'til the next one comes out..... and the next one after that!
B007XF4J66|5.0|My husband and I enjoy watching this movie.  We never get tired of watching Bergman and Bogart.  I like Claude Rains also.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Well written; very engaging plot line and character development.  This is one of the best books I have read all year
B009AMANBA|4.0|Enjoyed movie, depicts Lincoln very well. Would recommend this movie to everyone.  Learned things I did not know before about Lincoln
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who doesn't like a good game of Klondike? You won't be disappointed with this one.<br />There are many advertisements, but it's to be expected with the free version. Nice game and just a little addictive.
0684135051|1.0|I bought this book because i wanted to make the hat on the cover.  Not in there. This book should be called The Zen of knitting for this one yackety woman. Maybe 3 pics, lots of space and small word font. Im so dissapointed.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This is an action packed movie with a nice message.  Amazing visuals and epic battle scenes.  Enjoyable for children and adults!
B006HAPY26|5.0|I loved the first book of Cherub so I read and loved the next a good book I would recommend it
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice view of map and upcoming weather on one screen. I like the ease of getting from one city to others I have saved.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|Watched this show when it was originally on back in the day and it still stands up today.  One of the best shows ever made! Give it at least two or three episodes and you will find yourself hooked. The series year after year gets better and you will not regret watching!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have gotten several of our friends and family members &#34;hooked&#34; on the program also!  The characters are well developed and surprising.  Wonderful story.  Serious details of history help in the enjoyment of the program.
B007T99ENE|3.0|Anyone reading the first paragraph and thinking they're in for a thrill ride into the cold and mysterious waters of the spy world will be disappointed. Ditto for those looking for romance, as the love story is lukewarm at best. It's an easy enough read, but the heroine is a bit of a drip (as close to those cold, mysterious waters as you'll get) and there's something that doesn't quite ring true about her. On the other hand, the final chapter is the best of the book, so if you can hang in there it reveals all in a very clever way.<br /><br />This was my first Ian McEwan book and I'll need to be persuaded to try another.
0761169253|5.0|I love the ideas that assist me in stretching my mind again.  I had become a bit stale in thoughts.  Love the new adventure I am having right now.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is ok but all you really do is jump on trains,avoid getting hit by trains & trying to get the coins.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|If you like the Jack Reacher books (and I do), you will like this one. The plot has great twists and turns that keep you on your toes. Like all the Reacher books, our hero prevails in the end, but you knew that would happen.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved the tone of this story. Very real and clever -the characters are quite well written.  Augustus is a beautiful soul.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Townshend tells his life story without sparing his ego. He comes across as a very talented man with substantial flaws. Normally, when I read an autobiography I like the author better after reading it. I did not have that feeling when I finished this book. I appreciated Townshend's honesty, even if he did not endear himself to me.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Season 5 is proving to be one of the best so far.  Murder mystery still interesting and the main character budding relationship continues to provide humourous moments, dramatic moments, and tender moments.  It has been very easy to relate to the characters depicted in this show.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|If you review all my past reviews you'll see that I'm one person who is totally hard to scare. WELL FOLKS, I'M SCARED. This was one hell of a movie. There hasn't been a movie that made me completely uncomfortable to watch until now. The title says it all. THIS IS A MUST SEE!!!! Keep the lights ON watchers and try not to hear the footsteps above you.<br />WOW, WHAT A MOVIE!!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I love love love Bruno Mars and this CD is really great.  I only give it 4 stars because of some language, I don't believe it's necessary but I do love me some Bruno Mars, he's one of the best today, he sings beautifully and writes amazing songs, he has a ways to go but I believe he is the Michael Jackson of this era.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I like this game very much.  It is not hard to gain coins and unlike other games I have worked with, your animals don't require real money if they &quot;become sick&quot;. You can spend real money but you do not have to to play. I have no issues with this game at all and would reccomend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Up until this season the show was going good and not going crazy pushing propaganda (almost all PBS supported shows do).  But in season 3 we were subjected to multiple episodes (at the end of the season) which seemed to focus almost wholly on pushing the homosexual agenda.  Even in this WW1 era series, each episode attacked conservative and moral values. We were not surprised that a PBS supported show did this, but disappointed that again we can not even enjoy a &#34;classical&#34; drama without social indoctrination.
B004EWFUQY|2.0|I didn't like the fact that the diet was basically ALL protien and forbid fruits and other good for you things. I only lasted about two days on the attack phase and it was way hard.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I had never seen this show in any form. Now I am sure I will watch it again. I like being able to watch it blu ray if my player cooperates or DVD if it won't. And if I am ever somewhere with good Internet, we. Can try digital.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|Works great. Plug and play. No problems at all, has been running flawlessly for a month now. This processor is about the best bang for your buck that you will find. Easy to install. You can watch a youtube video just before installing it if you have any reservations.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|After completing the book I couldn't help wondering how many women were trapped like Erin. My sense is there may be quite a few but even one is too many.  I only hope they are as strong and as brave as her.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  I had no knowledge of this event and the movie inspired me to learn more.
B00BJB2C8W|3.0|the album they sent me did not play the last song! so watch out people who buy this product other than that the album is great!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great app.  It is easy to use .  The search feature gives you several options to search by. I have found this to be very helpful!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I have read all of Nesbo's books and this was as good as all the others.  Can't wait for the next series of his books.  You start reading and can't stop.
0761169253|5.0|This is a perfect description of the artistic experience.  You take what you like from various artists and paintings and make it your own.  Wonderful.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Card's novel is one of the most thought-provoking I have ever had the pleasure to read. I normally dislike science-fiction, but I have to say, Ender's Game is now amongst my favorite books.
B0049IWQJW|5.0|My two and a half and tree year old grandchildren love this movie. Each car has a different personality that really comes through. For adults, it's a nostalgic trip back in time to small towns in America and what happened to them when the super highways came along. A heartwarming and enjoyable storyline for all ages.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have seen the first and second seasonsa of Downton Abbey.  It is very well written and quite an interesting story.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|just as fun as the first one but with a lot more levels my son loves this game and so do i
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it...been waiting long time to watch that finished in one weekend.  Would order more again from here if needed too.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a great show and really captures the original books.  This one is way better than the American remake.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett does it again.  Book is well researched, integrating multiple characters in complex plot.  Looking forward to last book in trilogy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is a reason this book has so much buzz, and its not because of how it was published. It is a must read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest and have been known to waste hours looking for things I'm interested in.  The only problem is some updates cause some crashing on kindle fire.  It's very nice that I can use the app instead of the web version or even the original mobile version.
1401923127|5.0|I liked the book very much and bought a second one for my daughters best friend who studies pharmaceutical science. She showed great interest in broadening her understanding on how the body really works! A very insightful and deep understanding of the connections between mind and body and how the body really works.
B0044LHN0G|5.0|The music, book and movie are all excellent.  A  fictional story that reads like a historical account.<br />The story a a young girl in the 1920,s through the American occupation of Japan at the end of WW !!.<br />The soundtrack to the movie provides a seamless backdrop to a visually stunning movie directed by Steven Spielberg.
B006RXSM9A|5.0|Not the first time I see this movie. Just love it! REcommend it to all your friends and they won't regret being your friend.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I chose this movie, because Denzel is an awesome actor. I enjoyed it the first time and every time I watch it, there's always something new that I learn or notice.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like this version but it isn't really may favorite.  I have already played and received 3 stars on all levels.  Not really sure that there are going to be any new updates.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|this movie for me was way too long.  not enough action or as i expected.  try hard to stay awake!
B003P4L872|3.0|A classic resource that was purchased as a resource for my office and while I haven't had the occasion to use it yet, it offers practical tips.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Love this movie, it has so much action you have to watch it over and over, and just when you watch it, something new!<br /><br />Great movie for everyone!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love Angry Birds and as the original version this has been well played.  The only problem is there hasn't been an update in a while!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|it wont download the game so I can play it but the game looks fun to play with come on people
0375851569|5.0|Dr. Seuss is such a children's classic.  I love this collection!  Some of the best books which come in a really nice set.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|Saw the preview 2 days ago.  While I would only give 3 star (like) rating for the story, the visuals (5 star), direction (4 stars), and the soundtrack (4 stars) are amazing.  I saw it Imax, from 2nd row.  I was immersed in sound & video.  Only wish that the story developed a little more.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|A classic book by Shelley and it has been translated very well into a Kindle edition.  The price wasn't bad either.
0345803507|5.0|I had the first two books and I had to get the third. Very good collection. I do plan to reread these and many of my friends have barrowed these to read. Have not heard any complaints. Once you start reading you will want to go on reading without stopping.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I saw it in the theaters and loved it.  The combo pack with the UltraViolet Digital Copy is great because I can share movies with my friends and family.
B000O78KW4|5.0|My brother has a complete collection of Bruce Willis movies and I ordered this one to complete his collection. He says it is a very good movie so I may have to barrow this one and watch it.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love Angry Birds and this is one of my favorite versions of the game.  I like that it changes depending on the holiday.  My only complaint is that updates seem to occurs so infrequently.
B0039A8QVI|5.0|No one in this world who like good music will dislike Easton. This is a great album. he is a rising star.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Not sure how you could ever go wrong with The Muppets.  My boyfriend has always been a huge fan and this was a gift for him.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|this movie came out soo good its grear when they bring out classics especially an awesome one.. i recommend it yes we all seen top gun but have you seen it in HD and in 3D noo bcuz your reading this just buy it and have it in your collection trust me it will get you laid
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like this app and use it all the time.  From grocery lists to &#34;to do&#34; lists to ideas for the future.  This is really helpful.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is so cool. I love the game and its graphics. You should get it also. NO PROBLEMS so cool
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a big fan of pinterest!  Great ideas and fun to look at when you don't have anything else to do.  The app works great!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I really liked it. And so do my friends. The only thing is when you push up on the LED light it pushes the sound button inside also, but only for a second so it goes off when I don't want it to for on a fraction of a second though. I'm ok with that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was really sucked in to this story and I read all three books in about 9 days.  I couldn't put it down!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|future purchases of movies that I do not have will be Blu-ray from now on it unless they are more expensive than DVDs and I have the 1st movie on DVD and Robert Downey Junior plays a great Sherlock Holmes.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Fun to use to edit pictures taken on your phone.  You are able to do a lot of creative things with your pictures.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I like the fact that they used real Scottish people in this movie it shows the professionalism of Disney that they will always be superior and it makes it so authentic that in the special features the Scottish people were very proud to represent themselves.  It is a great movie and I think a lot of young people should watch this.
1616550414|5.0|It's awesome. If you want a good summary and detailed art of many of the games then this is for you.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|The quality of the sound is great compared to the television original broadcast and the fact that you can choose the closed caption of what they are saying finally realizes what was said in the opening of the show when Lee Majors states what is wrong with the lift body that he is testing.  You could never hear this word on the original broadcast clearly.  I like the fact that there are 3 pilot movies but I was disappointed that the misinterpretation or understanding where the made for television movies were either located on this season one or which season they are on if at all so that is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A riveting journey through a very honest expression of an Orwellian government, with all the duplicitous nature of man intertwined. Great read. That being said, some of the characters have conflicting characteristics that make them seem more confused than worthwhile... On top of that, the ending feels rushed, manufactured.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Hi Folks,<br /><br />I have read MANY books on screenwriting (including Syd Field's defining book!) and NO BOOK has EVER made me a better screen writer - UNTIL NOW!<br /><br />Using Blake's awesome 10 genre, 15 beat system I'm now able to organize my ideas (inspiring NEW ones!) and actually WRITE!<br /><br />I love his techniques so much I also bought his software (which last I checked could be had for around $65ish here on Amazon, and it normally goes for $100. - If you get it from Blake's sight - GET A COUPON as they still honor them! It's still a bit cheaper  here though.)<br /><br />Even if you have to grab this from your local library first to see that I'm right about this - do it! You'll quickly see that the book's worth EVERY PENNY to have as a reference (especially the Kindle Version, as I have now)<br /><br />Have Fun,<br />Erik
B004UAOG9W|5.0|I admit I was led to U/D by Downton Abbey which I was also somewhat late to discover. I remember seeing parts of this series when I was younger but, as a restless youth more interested in rock concerts, I never really gave it a close watch. Now after reading Thackery and much Dickens, I appreciate more the subtle rebellion in such a rigid class-based society. And while DA has the edge with set, costumes, and film quality, I agree with Emma that U/D has both better writing and acting as well as excellent camera work. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy DA but it seems that they always need a death to move the plot along. U/D is more artful in that regard. Both series however do have interesting plot twists. For DA fans waiting for the next installment, give this series a try. You may well be disappointed after the first episode but will be hooked by the third. Don't be put off by the black and white episodes. That was not an artistic call but the result of a technicians strike in 1971. Give it a go old chap. It will help you understand why our friends across the pond are so constrained yet clever. It may also help us recover such manners as these cultural cousins claim we never possessed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive on a whole new level. I love all kinds of games that give my brain a good work out. This game is so simple, yet so challenging and fun. I love it! And so does my husband and my four year old daughter.
030758836X|3.0|Well, it started out very strong.  Quirky, unlovable characters. A plot that took as many twists and turns as a mountain pass.  It was a page turner; I had trouble putting it down not knowing what raveling and unraveling of the story line was coming.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:  about 3/4 through I decided that there was only one ending that would be wrong; and of course that's how it ended.  In fact, I do not think this was the ending originally intended by the author.  Why would Flynn introduce a demented father who runs into the house furiously looking for the \\"bitch\\" unless the intended end for Amazing Amy was somehow in his hands.  Alfred Hitchcock once said that if you introduce a gun in scene one, it better go off before the play is over; it holds for novels as well
B00B22IJXK|1.0|Axiem has stolen Aviary and is no trying to sell it to you. It's not their product.<br /><br />And amazon isn't any better for not doing their due diligence when thieves present apps to them!
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Combining his style with the elements of the spaghetti western from the 1960's and 70's, Quentin Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED is humorous, violent and powerful. Tarantino pays loving tribute to those films that inspired him from the pop zooms that Sergio Leone began using and that became a key part of the \\"style\\" of these films, to the grainy look of the film.<br /><br />Featuring strong performances from the entire cast, DJANGO UNCHAINED may run a bit too long (the middle section of the film drags a bit)but the performances always keep it interesting particularly that of Oscar winner Christoph Waltz who continues to prove himself one of the best actors currently working in films.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />The plot focuses on Django (Jamie Foxx)a slave separated from his wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington)who ends up assisting bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Chrisoph Waltz)in idenifying and bringing in criminals. Schultz, in turn, offers to help Django find his wife in Mississippi who is the property of Calvin Candie (Leonardo di Caprio). Candie uses his male slaves as Mandingo fighters forcing them to kill their opponents. Schultz and Django use the ruse that they are looking to purchase Mandingo fighters from Candie to gain access to his plantation and free Django's wife.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks terrific with deep, rich blacks and a transfer that is state of the art. Colors positively pop and detail is exceptionally good and crisp. I didn't note any visible compression artfiacts.<br /><br />The 5.1 audio mix likewise is top notch. Dialogue remains crisp and clear throughout (regardless of whether one listens to the English, Spanish or French soundtrack)and we get subtitles in English and Spanish.<br /><br />While the supplements are quite good, they are also quite meager for a film like this. I was hoping for audio commentary of some sort as well as more supplements. What we do get, however, is quite good including a supplement on the production design done by the late J. Michael Riva (who died during production but did manage to do some interviews which are included here). It runs about 13 minutes<br /><br />We also get a featurette on the stunts for the film (again about 13 minutes), as well as, one on the costume designs for the film. There are also two promos for the Tarantino Blu-ray collection, as well as, the soundtrack album.<br /><br />We also get a DVD of the movie.<br /><br />Tarantino does a good job of paying tribute to the westerns of Leone and others in this violent but entertaining western. While the supplements could have been more extensive (I would look for a possible deluxe version down the line with more supplements--I don't have any information on this but given its two Oscars for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay as well as Tarantino's reputation, it seems likely), this is a nice looking blu-ray.<br /><br />Recommended.on the production design done by the late J.

B002HFJ77S|5.0|Really loved this book. The story line was great although I thought it contained excessive cursing. Wish there would have been more about what happened after everything came together.
140053271X|5.0|A space saver. I have 100's of books and have ran out of space, so this will help me save space and still enjoy my books.
1581806574|5.0|Simply the best &#34;how to draw&#34; book I have ever seen! Instead of just showing some circles and then - voila - a dragon, it actually details the steps, illustrating the new ones clearly. The author is a great artist and a skilled teacher. You will definitely benefit from buying this book.
B00BKS1HIA|5.0|Great instructions, good pictures, different ways to knit socks.  Easy to understand even for those of us just beginning to knit.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My sister recommended this game and my boyfriend plays it all day after work. he can't put the kindle down. He says it's addictive. So much that we have had it for almost a month and I haven't even gotten to play it yet!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun but difficult after level 50. I am playing it again to avoid some mistakes like the zodiac. It makes three room unassessable.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Django was funny at times, angering at times and truly triumphant.  Love just knows no bounds.  Good one Jamie Foxx.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Very nice story.  Great special effects. The whole family enjoyed it very much. Even though a low priced item (17USD) it came with all the bells and whistles more expensive blurays come with like several audio channels,  subtitles and so on.  Great value.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|What can I say.  Beloved characters took on greater characteristics.  I am grown and can't get enough of watching this movie!
034580404X|5.0|Read book one on my kindle for free then couldn't get the others thru lending and decided to buy the set.  Glad I did... read all 3 books in less than 3 weeks!  Couldn't put them down!
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|it's a really well done surf movie from Hollywood, and actually tells a true story. The water footage is amazing. They come right into my living room
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the fact that it curves and isn't just a strait line you have to go on is a challenge but its lovely. the new obstacles are interesting and different enough from the first temple run that you can tell they took time to make this game. loooooved it.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|It downloads fine, but the second it starts installing it just stops and goes back to the cloud. This has happened 5 times so far. It sounds good, but seems like I'm not going to get it.<br /><br />Is there any way to get my money back?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is perfect. It has just enough story to make it interesting. The graphics are great on my kindle HD. And this was CHALLENGING....not IMPOSSIBLE. I really enjoyed it. While it wasn't short by any means, I still would've liked it to be longer. Can't wait to play more like this one.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Saw it in theaters and decided I had to have it. I enjoyed this movie more than the LOTR trilogy. Some people thought it moved too slow, but I was entertained through the whole movie and felt it kept a good pace.
B008602KQI|3.0|I was disappointed with this movie, after reading the book this movie just doesn't compare. The director truly lacked imagination in the making of  this film.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|5 stars for the product 5 stars for the costumer service. 10/5<br />lit helped me a lot in bf3. All the buttons are useful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wish there was more books but they were amazing i just wish they didn't have to end this was my first ever book series I have completely finished
B000FC1AGG|2.0|I think it is a copy cat of the BRIDGIT JOAN'S DIARY movies.  No suspense.  The  'secret' was to unimportant-- not what the title suggested.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love the way Ethan tries to reach Lena when she is going through a hard time...and just dose not stop. IF you love this series then you would love the mortal instrument series. I loved this series and I fell in love with city of bones.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know this is an extremely good game though. One tip I would give to new players though, be careful for walking green cactuses known as creepers.
B0041KOVNW|5.0|Let the Devil take you in his arms, and whisper malevolent nothings into your ear. Seriously get this record - and the new one.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show is very well written and grips my full attention. Each episode draws me in even more than the last.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at this movie as sometimes Q.T. is hit and miss with his movies.  Strong performances from Jamie Foxx, Chris Waltz, Leonardo Dicaprio and Samuel L Jackson.  The story , a freed slave, Jamie Foxx teams up with the a German bounty hunter, sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner. Entertaining til the end and enjoyable, strong plot and story, although the language and some of the violence may turn some people off, but the movie does a good job at reflecting the time.  Worth a rent or purchase.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I used the free version of this app for a year and a half and have finally upgraded to the paid version to support the developers of this great app. This is a full-featured, easy to use alarm clock that lets you customize almost anything you can think of, from length of time between snooze alarms, to how many snooze alarms, to what music or bell or tone you will wake up to. As others have mentioned, the best feature is the graduated alarm that wakes you up slowly, and you can even customize how slowly or quickly the alarm grows loud enough to wake you up.  Don't want it to get TOO loud?  No problem, there's a setting for that. Want the background color of the alarm clock to match your sheets? Set the color you want. You can do whatever you need or want with this app. It has never force closed or quit on me in all the time I have used it. A guaranteed no-regret app purchase.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Rebecca Stead did an amazing job on this book. A sad book with laughter and some joy with nice confusing chapters along and a great ending for the book. Of course I recommend this book to everyone who loves all of the above.
B002KV74ZG|5.0|First off, I'm not going to ignore some lousy acting here and there...but overall it was a great flick. Sure, there could have been a lot more character development and growth but hey, there was only 90 minutes to play with. I thought the storyline was thought out and actually allows for one's imagination to delve deep inside this plot. Not only were there many mythical ideas and religious ones as well, they threw in concepts from multiple dimensions (hell, heaven and regular life) all here surrounding us at the same time on many planes of existence. I thought the guy who played the devil did a fantastically creepy job! He was like a snake! From angels to demons to Keanu Reeves I'd say this movie is worth a watch... Who knows, you may just love it! I recommend this movie (and I'm the kind of guy who wouldn't recommend &#34;The Guitar&#34; like some of these people on here would!!!
B000002NFM|5.0|i guess this is the  best studio album from the band, anyway pay atention to the live versions, quite unreal
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|We really like this app. We like to write little notes on this. My son likes to write stories using this.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|I remember when I was watching the movie, it was like 2 am and I said to myself why I got so connected and the music was the reason, some feeling with the 80's got inside.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|We love this game. It's like the video games you played when you were younger. My 4 year old loves this game also.
B00006GA4C|4.0|My Best friend bought Grand Funk Live, I bought the RED album.......Led Zep 2, needless to say the red ablum with it's simple production rocked my little mono player in my bedroom, at 13 I was hooked on GFR.........I still listen to this album often, They boy's were on their way............
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|My son think the game is okay.  Truly not the worse game but not the best.  He plays still play the game but not as often as others.
B00006GA48|4.0|&#34;Sin's a Good man's Brother&#34; is worth the price of this CD, this is their third outing and really put them on the map and Times Square in NYC. I like this Album/CD, they were getting better and Farner was writing songs at a pace that has God sent.<br />Again like any GFR music play it Loud! It's 70's Rock and Roll.......Again Buy the First Grand Funk Live Album, if you have never heard it..........That will be all it will take to get you hooked, &#34;In to the Sun&#34; the encore will blow you away, as well as &#34;In Need&#34;<br />I enjoy GFR because when I was a teen in the 70's they blew away Led Zep, Sabbath and others for me, until I heard the YES Album......Bravo the 70's. When I want to Rock I put on GFR, when I want to listen to great music I put on any one of the YES albums from the 1970's.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Once again my son requested to play a game on the kindle and he did llike this game.  He shared this game with other children his age and older.
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|An intense, funny and gory old school horror movie. It was ahead of its time. You have to consider that it was made on a budget, but it still found unique and inventive ways to thrill. No one else could have pulled these acting stunts off any better than Bruce Campbell and I really appreciated Sam Raimi's directing style here, especially the camera work.  I like this one a little more, but you should also see the original version and have fun comparing the two.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go.  I watched the whole season in one sitting, and I'm ashamed to admit it.  If you are not a prude, by all means buy it.  I say that because the negative reviews seem to focus on the nudity and sex which, in my opinion, relate directly to the plot and underline the difficulty that Brody has with intimacy.  Enjoy Homeland!  I can't wait for season 3.
B00B47MTZC|1.0|Unfortunately I bought the season pass and have watched every episode thus far. Each episode the story gets more ridiculous. It was about episode six when I thought, \\"OK, this is really getting stupid!\\"... and now I hate this show so much I hope it doesn't return for a second season. I'm going to laugh if this same story continues on with Joe for another season because it's already absolutely absurd. The FBI STILL can't find the house! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! My advice, don't waste your time.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Love the show, very real. So shocking in the non stop action. Will watch all the seasons. Go Vic Go
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Best Free Game I have ever downloaded in my entire life! Get Leps World now!! And I mean it really!!! Have Fun!!!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I thought Anne Hathaway was excellent, Hugh Jackman acted brilliantly (but sang awkwardly) and Russell Crowe... well, he didn't do my favorite songs justice, but that's more the fault of casting than of Crowe himself.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried was lovely and, I thought, a beautiful singer.<br /><br />I love Les Mis, have since I was a child, so while this cannot in any way compare to the actual Broadway performance, it's a well done, accessible version of the legendary musical for those who can't or won't see it performed live.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|For kids it is almost educational there creative juices flow which is needed in school and a plus side is it is entertaining great app
B00C5ZORES|4.0|It had some catchy tunes and the overall flow was solid.  I enjoyed listening to it but it wasn't something I'd want to listen to repeatedly and that is how I measure if I like something or love it.  If I love it I'll want to listen to it often and look forward to listening to it.  This album I would listen to again but I'm not all gaga about it.  Their earlier work was much more in the vain of wanting to listen repeatedly.  Still, it was good and I'd probably recommend it to one of their fans but I probably wouldn't have a new listener start with this album.
B007VUCAVO|2.0|I use the Motorola Photon G and installed a double-capacity battery which totally confuses the built-in battery indicator. Typically I get at least a day of additional usage after it starts issuing low battery warnings. I bought battery HD pro in the hope that, since it seems to have a self-calibration capability, it would give me a more realistic indication of actual battery time left. But unfortunately, no dice. I calibrated with the new battery and battery HD pro still shows the same inaccurate indication as the built in software.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|If art imitated life than the wonderful ethical gracious character of Matthew (at the end of season three) would not have cheated his cast members, or his fans. He would have been more of a team player and not broken up this amazing ensemble group of the best theatre, story and characters I've ever seen. What work could he possibly have found more worthy to pursue than this classic timely tale of humans becoming more human, and the breaking down of the fable that the rich have it any easier than the poor. Downton Abbey is an important work. It is a piece of history and insight into both the past, present and future. A drama that shows that all of us are not always just good or bad, and the reasons we make the choices and mistakes that lead us all to grow, no matter how many pennies we have in our pockets, or pedigrees we hang on our family tree. I hope by the time the fourth season begins the infamous actor who played Matthew will have come to his senses, and the writers will act in the best interest of families everywhere and stop killing them off.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Ugh, annoying, loathsome, whiny people doing terrible things to each other. Not my idea of a good read. Sorry I wasted my time on it.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I like the book a lot!  It is helping create insight into my self and my world that will help me to live a better life through love.
B002QEXBGS|5.0|Natalie Dessay as Eurydice and Yann Beuron as Orphee guarantee a humorous and provocative presentation of this 1997 production, which could only come from the Lyon Opera. Marc Minkowski is the conductor and Laurent Pelly is the stage director. Enjoy!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was scary,suspensful, sad,breathtaking. It was a good relief that Frank was able to live. And hazel too. It was good Percy didn't drown in the water. This book was extremely good.thank you Rick rodren for making this wonderful book for kids to read.
B006M4F67A|5.0|The variety of games keeps you from getting board and the range difficulty never lets you get bored.  It has all the popular games and new ones I haven't tried yet.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Perfect ending for the series,teens,pre teens and adults would love it.It will truly last... Forever in our hearts for every twihard.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|This was a very wanted item. My Husband is very happy with this cd and even keeps the whole album on his iPod.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game includes a vast amount of things quality graphics and gameplay little downs but it does take some time
B000EHRVP6|3.0|my youngest, a real horror fan asked for this but he told me that to him it was not that scary<br />personally I did not see it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was recommended Gone Girl by a friend, and after seeing multiple people reading this book on the tube I decided I would have to purchase it.<br /><br />Gone Girl was a gripping read that had you intrigued the whole way along. The author is very clever and it is evident she knew every element of her Book, it felt very well thought out.<br /><br />I loved the characters and particularly enjoyed reading Amy's diary, a very smart woman indeed!<br /><br />Defintely worth reading but perhaps not overly memorable.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I found it very suspensefull. Always a new twist. The characters came alive and I never knew what was coming next. An excellent read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Stereotypical and abhorrent in its degrading depiction of a lifestyle based in love and respect. Don't waste your time. Awful!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An incredible story!  I couldn't have survived!  Ang Lee is amazing!!!  I highly recommend the film even though it turned out to be quite different from what I was expecting!
B005LAIIKI|1.0|A good movie to me is one you want to watch, again and again and again.  You will pick up new themes, new things about the characters that give them depth.  This is not one of those movies.<br /><br />This is typical Tarrantino GARBAGE.  A smorgasbord of stolen ideas all thrown together in the hopes of holding your attention.  There's just something about his movies to me that are SOULLESS.  That said it is decent the first time through, after that not so much.
B00BS4U8VS|2.0|I have the hardest time getting the Amazon player to load. It takes about three hours to watch a 45min show because it stops every two minutes to spend another two minutes loading. Very frustrating! If it were on Netflix, I'd definitely use that!
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is mostly faithful to the book. The story is very disturbing and I think better suited for older teens and adults, definitely not youngsters. Woody Harrelson in one of his best roles. Though this seems rather negative, the movie is very well done and tells a compelling story. Glad it is out on Prime before part II comes out.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|If you got hooked to Season 1, get ready to lose a bunch of hours as you plow through Season 2.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Okay this book is totally not what I was expecting. I really enjoyed reading this story and can't wait to read it to my son. The moral of the story is, of course important, but I also love the humor behind the delivery. Well done.
1569242739|5.0|I have tried so many recipes from this book - and have yet to find one that isn't delicious.  These cupcakes are now the official birthday/special occasion treats for my non-veg family.  I think people have become so used to the grocery-store cheapo cupcakes they forget how cupcakes are supposed to taste!  These are so light and moist and fluffy - what's not to love?  My favorite cupcake is Cookies 'n Cream, second favorite is the Golden Vanilla.  Who knew a vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting could be so flavorful??  They taste 'buttery'.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I had heard rave reviews about this book. I kept waiting for it to enthrall me. Good plot a little dull.
0743289692|3.0|I'm not familiar with the religions and cultures described in this book and this isn't a book I'd ever normally buy, however, it was recommended by a friend and she really wanted me to read it so I tried it.  After 2/3 of the book, I had read enough.  Regardless of the author's intentions to express life in certain cultures/religions, I simply didn't want to hear about the horrible treatment of women any more.  I just do not understand how reading this could provide a positive outlook toward life.  It was depressing and upsetting and I prefer books that are more upbeat.  This is a great book for those who are looking for a better understanding of women who (according to the author) are treated rather horribly, but it's not a beneficial book for us regular ladies who are looking for interesting reads.  Maybe if I finish the book, it will provide closure, however, I don't want to read about womens' mutulations any more to reach the end of the book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic series. Started watching after hearing others talk about it, and I couldn't stop. Direction and writing is wonderful. The characters draw you in and you get caught up in the story snd the lifestyle of the time period.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love this game but it freezes too often. Bingo Blitz freezes so much that it's hard to enjoy the game.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|This CD is nice.  The instrumental is excellent.  JT did a good job.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this CD.
0143037757|5.0|I must say I am very glad to have purchased and read this book on post-WWII history of Europe. The book contains invaluable information and telling photos depicting the changes that have happened to Europe 60 years or so after the War. Readers are presented a very detailed and vivid account of the complex ethnic, political, religious and social fabric of Europe before and after the War. It's only after reading Judt's monumental work that one could hope to understand the events that have occurred and are still occurring in Europe today.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|The idea is the same as Diner Dash, but with Hello Kitty and her gang. With this in mind I thought it would be fun. You start with one server, but after that you have to pay to get anymore to help as waiting to have enough of the required coins takes way more levels than would make sense, as in one com per level and another person costs 150 coins. Your starting person moves too slow and you can't advance click to let them know you want them to go. You have to seat, take order, make good, serve, clean table, and take payment. Evening moves so slow that even on the first level people are getting angry and very the second to level they are leaving.<br />This will test the patience of anyone who has ever played Diner Dash or any other service game and is truly not for little ones as they won't make part first level beyond the tutorial.
B0052REQLK|3.0|I was excited to read this book because I wanted to know what lessons for living the author identified. The premise is excellent and the 30 lessons are very good. However, I think the author could have communicated them more effectively if he had not included so  much narrative. He elaborates and inserts too much of his own opinion with the examples and points that the &#34;experts make.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true American Hero A great book for anyone to read I definitely give it 5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />RIP CHRIS KYLE
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Initially I didn't think I'd enjoy this book as much as I did. Job well done John Green. You deserve all 5 stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game if u ever see this game you need to get it it is really easy all u have to do is that u need to run away from the person that is chasing u.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|If you are 65 and want to be 20 again just volunteer to join up. 10 years later you have a brand new super charged body and fight to save mankind in the galaxy. When you are done you get to live out your life as a colonist - a second life. Only catch is there's a 75% or more chance you won't live through 2 years service and little of making it through an extended 10 year tour. But hey, I am 67 in 8 more years, if I'm still alive, I will be in the stars. Chances are if I stay here I won't make it to 77 or 85 either so I signed up. COLONIAL DEFENSE FORCES--BooRA!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I hunted this one down after having found its predecessor and having  had thoroughly enjoyed it. It keeps myself, my 19 year old (a black ops enthusiast) and my 12 year old (a minecraft fiend)  entranced.  There was even a puzzle where the 3 of us sprawled on the floor, heads together, working though it. But I feel a small pang when I select a level and see how few there are left undone. I've rationed myself  until I the next is released.
B00BHU261S|5.0|I love Helen! She is a splendid acctress. Anthony Hopkins was superb as well. I also like how they integrated one of Alfred's movies. I loved this movie!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this rating because it mostly raps you into the book.<br />I like this book because it tells you a lot of more information than any of the other books.<br />I dislike this book because it has kissing in it and because it has a Valentines Day dance.<br />I`d recommend this book to my older sister Olivia and to my cousin Charleston.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Good crime movie, but lots of cussing. Did a great job. Loved everyone in this movie. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I bought this on a whim because of other followers on twitter and I totally love it! So very &#34;up beat&#34; and the amazing violin!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I have just never cared for Sally Field as an acctress, something about her is very annoying! If you can overlook her, its alright.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I have been reading all of the Stephanie Plum series of books by Janet Evanovich. So far, this is the best! I have really enjoyed all of them.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's a pleasure from beginning to the end for your soul and your senses.  The scenery is simply breathtaking, and a great escape from everyday life's stress!  Can't wait to start Season 3...
B008KRJWEK|4.0|the game is really fun but I don't like how you have to spend REAL money to buy the good stuff.
B004TI5N38|3.0|I have probably read most of Baldacci's books but none would get 5 stars.  I keep coming back because sometimes<br />there is a dearth of authors that I like with new books.  I read one review about this book which compared Zero<br />Day with Lee Child's The Affair.  Outside of the main characters being trained as CID officers, to me the<br />comparison ended there.  The one surprise with Zero Day that was refreshing was that the main character<br />did not end up sleeping with the female co-investigator.  Jack Reacher would have had that &#34;done and dusted.&#34;<br />Zero Day did keep me guessing, but the ending was slightly disappointing.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Interesting idea.  The end makes me think there is going to be a sequel. Definitely more of a children's book--doesn't quite make the crossover into adult fiction.  Would like to have known more about the Peculiar Children.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh is the greatest.  Whatever he sings comes out beautifully.  I enjoyed this cd very much.  I look forward to more.
B0083H6AQA|2.0|I watched this movie, but it was just not what I thought it was going to be. In parts it moved to fast and seemed hard to keep up. Some of the content is very much for older adults so make sure you don't have  any children around! I really love Robert Patterson and wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. For someone who has so much talent it seems that Robert Patterson often find roles that just don't fit who he is. I am waiting for something to come out with him in it that just takes my breath away and this movie did not do that.
0984380213|5.0|Nicely written. A lot of detail. Enough information for you to try and implement at your own company. Must read...do it!
1423140605|5.0|Riordan' s writing is always great- a better read on a teenage level than most books geared toward adults. Actually made me want to know what will happen next. A definite sign of a good book.
B005IS56CG|5.0|No apologies to be had on this album, folks. It's hard hitting, gritty, and motivating metal. The language is harsh, at times, as one would expect, but not just for the sake of being harsh; the lyrics actually make some sense. Back For More has become my &#34;I need to push through this set&#34; power song, and there's only one slow track (Remember Everything) I'm not a huge fan of. It's a decent tune, but slows things down right in the middle of the shredding, and really puts a kaibosh on the otherwise relentless power.
B001AITGWE|5.0|This has always one of my favorite movies.Prior to this purchase,I had this title in VHS format. DVD is so much better.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|I am a collector and when it comes to action pack movies there is nothing more exciting. Get this one !
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|definitely way too much drug use! Not sure if this was \\"based on true story\\" but not happy about the amount of drug usage.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Well put together and executed and character placement on point. I love action adventure.Enjoyed completely and you will too. !
B00881VLCE|2.0|I like the idea of a puzzle, but this is a little simple. So I don't go to the game that often.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good graphics, good interaction<br />Easy to play, and would be great for children. Name your own horse, play along easily
