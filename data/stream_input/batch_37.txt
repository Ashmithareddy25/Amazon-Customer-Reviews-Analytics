B00CTSDDVO|3|3D is just ok nothing spectacular.  Story line an old one with a twist.  Kirk and Spock emulate the original characters, which I appreciate.  I don't think I would want to watch this one over and over again.

0385737955|5|My brother who does not really like to read started reading a lot recently.  When I was buying my summer reading book my mom told me to order him a book to read as well. He chose &#34;The Maze Runner&#34; and once it came in he started reading it and was done in no time (even abandoned League for a bit to finish!).  When I asked him what the book was about he was very excited when explaining it to me as well.
0810993139|5|OMG, if you have not read Diary of A Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney, and have an hour to spare, I suggest you pick up this book. The main character is Greg, he's the middle child with two brothers, and one best friend whom he doesn't seem to like all that much. He's funny, he likes the ladies, he wants to be popular. Sound like your typical middle schooler!<br /><br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid contains simple drawings, the art is not perfect. However, it is a fast read and a silly romp recommended for a stressful day. It is not the book for someone who wants a deep meaningful read. I guess some people may dislike this book because Greg isn't a role model. In fact, he's self-serving, lazy, and kind of a jerk. Personally, I think he is the typical middle schooler. Aside from all of those terrible qualities, he's actually quite funny.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was the cheese touch, where this one kid touches a piece of months old moldy cheese, and then has the cheese touch so people try to avoid him so they don't get cheese touch either.
B003XYERRM|3|Review of the Author's Notes to 'The Sunne in Splendour'    I love Ms. Penman's writing and have found that she is better than some noted historical fiction writers at sticking with the facts and keeping them in pretty much the order they occurred. I must say, though, that I read her Plantagenet books in chronological order, so I was startled to see the discrepancies surrounding Richard I and Henry II in \\"Here be Dragons\\" and latter books she wrote. She addressed them, but...  Anyway, \\"Sunne in Splendour\\" is the last book I've read, and this review concerns its Author's Note.    It's a wonderful bonus when authors provide an Afterword and/or Author's Note to provide a deeper look into the background / events and to point out fictional characters, liberties with timelines, etc. Since part of the reason I read historical fiction is to learn, I like that Ms. Penman actually keeps those liberties fairly minor.  But, except for pointing these things out and providing BRIEF personal opinions with specific reasons for them, I strongly feel that the Afterword/Author's Note should be factual and objective. Writers already tend to color their story with shades of their own biases, so IMO, the Afterword/Author's Note should serve to keep the record straight. They should not be a self-serving means to further manipulate the reader into agreeing with his/her point of view, and I found this going on here with some unsubstantiated claims presented as facts.    An example is in a paragraph of Ms. Penman's 1982 assertion that Richard was not guilty of the disappearances and probable murders of his nephews. She says, \\"...no one has ever been able to explain why, if Richard were guilty, he would have chosen to commit the murders so as to do himself the greatest possible harm.\\"  The 'Britain Express' website states that \\"Richard was well aware of these rumours, and it is worth noting that he did not seek to counter them by the obvious expedient of showing the world that the princes were still alive and well. Were they already dead? We simply don't know. It may be that Richard believed that his nephews were truly illegitimate, and, as such, no longer of note.\\" So there is at least one posited explanation that, whether or not the princes were alive, Richard (IMO,unwisely) did not seem to respond to the cloud of suspicion around him that ultimately caused him \\"the greatest possible harm.\\" Also, if Richard had wanted to eliminate the princes, he could have arranged to have it done as suggested in virtually every website I've seen, via James Tyrell or other(s), leaving no direct evidence of his involvement. In 1502 (when he was tortured for treason) Tyrell supposedly confessed to the crime; according to this same website, \\"Under torture Tyrell confessed that he had killed the princes, though he supplied no information as to why or under whose influence he had acted.\\"  Of course it could've been Richard (who had the motive), though you'd think he would've arranged a scenario, e.g., for the princes to be seen going on an outing from which they don't return. Richard doesn't strike me as a rash man (though who knows how cunning), so I somehow doubt he was involved in the prince's sudden disappearance from the tower; I don't think he was that stupid. He may have even been innocent, but I disagree with the author's claim that \\"nobody has ever been able to explain why, if Richard were guilty, he would have chosen to commit the murders so as to do himself the greatest possible harm.\\"  Innocent or guilty, there are posited explanations (which is the best anyone can offer) suggesting that he had no intention of drawing suspicion upon himself.       Ms. Penman goes on to say, \\"Nor has it ever been explained why Elizabeth would then have been willing to give her daughters over to the man responsible for her sons' death.\\"  From just a brief online search of only three websites, I found that explanations have indeed been offered for this, too. Wikipedia says that \\"One possible motive for Elizabeth Woodville subsequently making her peace with Richard and bringing her daughters out of sanctuary could be that Richard had to swear a solemn oath, before witnesses, to protect and provide for her surviving children, which made it much less likely they could be quietly murdered as it was believed their brothers had been.[45][46][47]\\"   The website [...] offers several explanations:  \\"Elizabeth went on to make her peace with King Richard... This could imply that she had learned that at least one of her royal sons was still living, or that she did not blame Richard for whatever fate had befallen them. Equally, she may have decided that she had more to gain by working with him than by resorting to opposition.\\"   And [...] says that Elizabeth never believed the princes were murdered: \\"The former queen testified before Parliament that she believed the boys to be legitimate, but she would not agree to the assumption that they were dead. She never, to the day of her death, claimed they had been murdered.\\"  As good an explanation as any.     Perhaps these websites weren't around when Ms. Penman claimed, \\"no one has ever been able to explain why...\\" (Richard would cast suspicion on himself), and further claimed, \\"nor has it ever been explained why Elizabeth...\\" (would then put her daughters under Richard's care), but proposed explanations such as these were somewhere out there before being posted the internet...the internet simply made them easier to find. My point is that just because the author couldn't find any explanations doesn't mean there weren't any, so she shouldn't make sweeping statements like that.    I feel a bit manipulated when an author pushes an opinion too hard. In 1982, Ms. Penman couldn't have known for sure whether or not Richard had any physical deformities, yet she spent pages (in the Kindle edition) pushing her notion that he was the victim of a myth propagated by exaggerating medieval historians and detractors of Richard. I felt it was too lengthy of an opinionated argument for an Author's Note, and it failed to persuade me, anwyay; IMO, there must have been some type of physical anomaly to spark this \\"myth,\\" though there's no doubt it was greatly exaggerated....Richard couldn't have been the renowned warrior he was if his detractors (and good ole' Willy Shakespeare) were to be believed. In her 2013 Note, Ms. Penman relayed that the discovery of Richard's bones proved that he had scoliosis, as indeed it did; this made me respect him even more for doing as well as he did in battle, and I'm glad that the author follows up with subsequent discoveries.    All in all, I enjoy Ms. Penman's books. I like her writing style and am always drawn into her engaging stories based on historical records. I appreciate that she honors the record more than other writers of this genre do...she strives to write her stories around history instead of the other way around.

B0007P3582|1|Yawwwwwwwwwwwwwn. What's the difference between this guy, Ja Rule and Puffy? Well, this guy has been shot more times, that's about it. In terms of what you get when you press play, they are xerox copies of each other. Hey, let's go ahead and do a couple of tribute albums to this guy!! He deserves it just as much as eminem, which received his first tribute cd when he had been releasing cd's for about as long as this guy has, which is about 1 year. Once again, I did try to endure going through this stuff. I just couldn't. Did anybody notice this guy barely moves his jaw and lips when he raps? That's why he gets such a boring, monotonous, mumbling kind of undecipherable vibe. Reminds me of super musical genius Ja Rule. Remember mr.J had to lyp-sync on the Mtv VMA's as he is unable to reproduce rapping live, which is not anymore difficult than normal conversational speech!! Amazing. If these are the idols of today's youth, we are doomed. People who think this is music have no idea whatsoever about what music is. None at all. Zero. Nada. Actually, less than zero. But, ignorance is bliss. Hitting the \\"no\\" icon beneath this review because you are 50 fan and you THINK I am wrong is a stamp of approval - admitting that everything I have said are absolute truths. Go ahead, show us your ignorance. Those who vote in favor are rare glimmers of hope left in this world of musical ignorance. The facts speak for themselves, but only to those who have at least a basic level of musical knowledge. Now, excuse me. I have to get back to my Death Metal, Jazz, Blues, Funk, and Afro-Cuban CD's...REAL MUSIC.

B00JB3MVCW|1|As everyone probably already knows the movie is not Biblicaly accurate in anyway. It has nothing to do with the Bible which is sad because the real story of Noah would have made a much better movie.  Don't let other reviews fool you by saying the story is not long enough in the Bible.  Not true the real story could have made a great epic story.<br /><br />This movie frankly was a waste of my time to watch because I thought the movie was based on the Bible but took some creative liberty in telling the story.  But in reality the movie is pure fantasy and is completely made up.  In fact some parts are flat out stupid, parents not a kids movie at all.<br /><br />If you want to watch a fantasy movie that is a combination of an evil version of the The Never Ending Story and a dark version of the Chronicles of Narnia then you may like this movie.
0316666343|4|&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; captures beautifully and movingly a most memorable line from American poet jani johe webster:  &quot;life and death hold hands and dance around each person.&quot;  <br />In this novel, the young and likeable heroine (a heroine with attitude) experiences this dance of life and death even from beyond the grave, where she watches, in her heaven, the pain and the growth of her loved ones, who struggle with her murder.  Through the observation of this struggle, the narrator is able to make meaning out of her life and continue to experience a deep love and connection with her family, as well as an odd, almost friend, and her would-have-been boyfriend.  And in remembering her, each character also experiences the dance of life and death:  each character, in his or her own way, grieves and carries on with greater self-knowledge and deeper self-connection.<br />The book is a joy to read:  the voice of the narrator is distinctive and rich (we feel like we are listening to a teenager who has thought about life); the prose, details, and tension in listening to the narrator watch her murderer's strange and horrifying rituals, are gripping.  We become deeply involved in each character and also in the quest for the narrator's family to find both justice and meaning.<br />In this book, we see and feel again how painful is the dance of life and death:  painful, but not without hope.
B003U4ZQRK|5|Its pretty good Ebert. So calm down there metacritic, pull back on the reigns Haus, and give it a little viewing.
0393327655|3|This book is definitely not the best book that i have ever read on the topic. Sam Harris is not as convincing in his opinion as Richard Dawkins. I also think that Harris gets really off track when he starts questioning Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy and questioning politics. I also feel that some of what Harris said came across as arrogant, making it seem as though the United States is the best of the best, and all other countries are inferior, what this has to do with religion i don't know. Harris used this book mostly to cut down Islam rather than all the major religions. I think Harris' second effort - A Letter To A Christian Nation was much better. but still read the book.

B0001ZMWQO|4|<br />  I think i speak for many when i say that the arrival of Franz Ferdinand is gladly welcomed,  <br /> We could all do with a band that is just that little bit special, or i'll atleast settle for new band to appear on the scene that isnt named 'The' somethings.  <br />          <br />          So altogether now Hurrah for Franz Ferdinand. <br /> <br /> I will freely admit that before listening to the album i was like many ready to dismiss Franz Ferdinand as yet another snake hipped, messy haired band ready to jump aboard the indie/guitar/whatever/rock band wagon, but i take it all back they're actually very good. <br /> <br /> They may not be completely original, obviously there are comparrisons to other guitar bands such as 'The Strokes','Suede' and even 'The Clash'in places, but honestly does it really matter? certainly not to me, not if they're good, and Franz Ferdinand are brilliant, and they're debut album more than proves it.This is one band that is definatly not about the Hype, Its all about the music baby. <br /> <br /> The quartet originating from Glasgow came together with the unique musical idea that they wanted to create music for girls to dance. I'd say they've firmly acomplished what they set out to do, <br />  <br />The first single to be released from the album is the fabulous 'Take me out' which in all fairness starts of fairly inoffensivly, just about ticking all the right boxes for a fairly average guitar band, with fairly unimpressionable guitars and filler lyrics, However this all radically changes as the chorus prepares to make its grand entrance, the verse slows right down to an unexpected halt before making your hairs stand on air with a simple yet fantastically strong bass line, striking like a repetitive punch in the face for all those who ever dared undirestimated the talent of Franz Ferdinand. <br />  <br /> As the album continues it doesnt fail to impress, each offering on this album is a little peice of genius, with its own unique selling point,from the impossibly catchy 'Cheating on You' to the classic 'Michael' <br /> <br /> What i love about the album is that it has a wonderfully unrushed quality about it , the lyrical content is never less than perfect, simple and straight to the point, with each song telling its own quirky little tale, for example 'Take me Out' is supposedly meant to be about two snipers hunting each other down, <br /> <br /> I think we can optimistically expect a second album as i get the feeling that Franz Ferdidnand will be around for a while.  Granted the basic musical style in each song is fairly similar throughout, yet it works brilliantly and that is what gives this band its credibitlity and definate staying power, they've found the right style that works for them and they're sticking with it. <br /> <br />Also if you in the mood for something camp as christmas, and frankly a little weird, check out the 'Sissor Sisters' uber gay version of 'Take me Out'  <br /> It'll put a smile on your face if nothing else. <br />

0446310786|5|What can I say? The most powerful, influential, beautifully-written piece of literature of ALL time... that's saying a lot. To Kill a Mockingbird teaches us about the depths of human nature--prejudice, courage, fear, joys, hopes... Lee's use of projecting these ideas through the medium of childhood innocence and questioning works so well.. it's artfully and masterfully done in such a poignant, yet effective way. This novel will definitely move you and leave you speechless. Harper Lee is a genious of a writer. <br />EVERYONE, and I mean EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING, should have a chance to read this book sometime in their lives. It crosses all cultures, race, and creed. It's not just a read--it's an EXPERIENCE.

B00005N6KG|1|I have never written a review for a product before on Amazon but felt compelled to do so for these headphones as they have a major design flaw that needs to be addressed by Sony and that is such a major issue I would advise against buying them.<br /><br />Out of the box these sound great, very good for the price and comfortable in the ear. I have a problem with ear buds such as the iPod ones hurting my ears and do not have a problem with these.<br /><br />However, there is a big problem with these headphones. I have owned 2 pairs and they have both suffered from the same issue. After about 6 months use the connection in one ear goes. Shortly after the connection in the other ear goes. You can kind of wiggle the wire that goes into the headphone around to get the sound back, which suggests its the way wire goes into the headphone that is causing the problem. The wire goes in at the front and it looks like it wears thin after a while.<br /><br />I know these are only $9.99, but to have the same problem with 2 pairs suggests this is not an isolated incident. I would strongly advise against buying these as although they sound great out of the box, after prolonged use both pairs I have owned failed in the same way and are effectively junk after that.

He is that good.. i loved this movie, yes a little scary for my brothers at some parts (except they are really babyish) so dont' hesitate on buying it because of that.  it teaches good morals, and they did an awesome job on the dubbing (except personally i like it in japanese and subtitled) but thats just me.  I dont' want to get into the story and spoil it for you, but this is definitally an awesome movie!!!!!<br />p.s. Don't forget to see princess monoke, castle in the sky (which I loved) and kiki's delivery service.
6305609705|5|Visually, 'Apocalypse Now' is one of, if not the, most incredible films I have ever seen. Cinematically it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. The pacing of the movie is remarkable. I had problems with Apocalypse Now for most of the film because I thought it was too dramatic and detached. But by the end, I was completely submerged in it. <br /> <br />Captain Willard is played by Martin Sheen. He is instructed to kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an apparently insane American who has broken away from the army to play a brutal God. Every character is fascinating and unsettling. Sheen and Brando are extraordinary in their disturbing roles, as is Robert Duvall as the lieutenant colonel who is at one with the war. <br /> <br />As Willard sails up the river, each place is slightly more surreal and wild than the last. The level of tension and activity rise until Willard reaches his destination. Then the story slows to almost a standstill. The final part of the movie is set apart in a mystical space. Then it all comes together. <br /> <br />Most viewers probably know that Apocalypse Now is based on Joseph Conrad's novella, \\"Heart of Darkness\\". It follows the book more closely than I imagined it would, especially in tone. However, Apocalypse Now is its own story.
B008476HBM|2|I found this book long and dragging, no real signs of love until the end. I also did not know what was going on half the time.
0688014291|5|I have read this a couple of times in my career already, but the new boss just bought a hardback copy for his management team so I read it again. It doesn't take long.  <br /> <br />The authors of the negative reviews here miss the point. It's not a management tome meant to provide day-to-day advice, but rather a parable offering a timeless philosophy: Tell your employees what you expect, offer timely feedback and exhibit support. <br /> <br />One reviewer recommended an annual reading. I concur. It's easy to get lost in the specific details and lose sight of foundation principles. Buy the hardback, read and reread. Yes, there is a lot of whitespace, but it's about the message. It's not rocket science, but it's timeless. You and I could have written it, but Blanchard and Johnson beat us to it. <br /> <br /> <br />

0671042858|3|I enjoyed this book and I wish that people who don't normally care for Mr. King would read this one.  This one is well written without the gore, terror and intensity that so many of us love.  ( myself included )  If I am being honest though I must say that my rating was probably a little affected by the Red Sox theme as I am a hard core YANKEES fan.  Even considering that I would recommend this one.
B003V5ED7W|4|I am a youth leader and we are doing an Olympic theme during the Sochi Olympics. We showed this film on our winter retreat as an evening activity. It is a great Disney film, rated PG; however, it does have two or three swear words in it. Not something most people expect in a PG Disney movie, and typically not a big deal, unless you are with a church youth group. I remember watching this film as a child, it is very funny and not your typical sports movie, but still based on a true story. I love it.

B000S81MHY|2|The table I received out of the box already had too much play or movement when you turned the Y axis wheel you could see the table snaking in other words moving from side to side as it moved along the Y axis. Which would mean uneven or wavey cuts. So I tried to adjust the table using the tiny little adjustment screws, hopeless system of adjustment, one screw snapped right off so now cant adjust the table properly. Don't know how these tiny screws are meant to stop the table from moving out of square when they are so fragile. To be fair I didn't purchase the table from this seller but it was a brand new Proxxon KT70 table from another supplier. Anyway in my opinion this is FAR from being an awesome product as some have stated.
B008602KQI|5|The scenery, photography, costumes and storyline are all stellar. I wouldn't recommed to small children as there is violence against children by children, but, it is very entertaining.
B000I0QL82|4|I had never seen this movie and ordered it simply for the musical aspect (I love watching dancing and singing).  I was wondering why they didn't play this movie on TV during the holiday season until the one scene where the music and dancing were done in black face - yikes!  I get it!  Jeez...if you can deal with this type of old movie craziness then you will probably like the movie.
B0052UZIFA|1|Despite the claim in the descriptions, this game crashes to menu when ran on my Droid 2 Global. Does not work on most android phones from what I've read. I am surprised to see this low quality from Pop Cap Games.
B003G4W49C|3|This book is very well-written. The story grips you from the start, and it takes you the whole way through. I love how Card explored internet, video game and AI technology way back in the 80's. We see many of the things he talked about existing today. That being said, the only problem I had with this book is simple but important: the main character was just not likable for me. So much so, I'm not even interested in reading the sequel. Bottom line is, you're reading this piece of literature to be entertained, and it's the story of Ender. Ender's character was interesting; he's a thinker, and Card explores Ender's thoughts, his anxiety and his mental desire to love and be loved. By the end, though, I wasn't impressed enough to want to read more about him.
B000000OMJ|5|What do an amnesiac, an assassin, a chronic compulsive, and an  institutionalized lunatic have in common?  They all enjoy residence on this  incredible album by Peter Gabriel.  <br />The amazing lyrical territory is  matched by unprecedented sonics, which married dry guitars, erratic  keyboards, with heavily gated drums (which would later become Phil Collins  trademark sound). <br />One of the greatest albums of the decade.

B003L77GRO|4|Excellent. I really enjoyed the show and the product was very satisfactory. It was sealed nicely and in great condition.
B009HV2JT8|4|I read the book - which of course has more character development - but overall, I was happily impressed with the film.  Well acted, with tons of great cgi effects, it's a fast-paced, exciting movie that mixes history and fantasy.  While it had a certain amount of gore (it has vampires - what'd you expect?), to me, it wasn't over the top.  I'd watch it again!
B0011NVC98|4|For an animated movie, this was a remarkable film. It tells the story of Beowulf in dramatic fashion and I appreciated seeing this classic tale, that I have often heard referenced indirectly but had never read. It makes one appreciate heroic, Nordic story telling, with it's many monsters and ironies.      Animated charaters in a drama takes a little getting used to, especially with the celebrity actor voice-overs. The facial expressions are still not quite what we expect from humans, but they are getting closer every year.

B00011V8CW|3|Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full?<br /><br />BLACK TIE WHITE NOISE understandably evokes mixed reviews.  I'm a little mixed up about how I view this album as well.  BTWN is more in the 3 to 3.5 range for me.  But frankly, Bowie hasn't had a uniform approach or reaction from his fans since his 70s heyday.<br /><br />BTWN wasn't really a comeback or return to form.  It was Bowie trying to give up pleasing the public and doing what he wanted.  Mostly.<br /><br />Nonetheless, within his musical palette, Bowie seems to try to do everything sometimes, and listening to this reminds me of Lodger which was experimental but slightly off-kilter.  It wasn't an album you could love or pin down.  BTWN is certainly more smooth as a listening experience, and reminds me of TONIGHT.<br /><br />What's good about BTWN:  Bowie trying to be fresh, and mixing it up, with jazz, funk, rock.<br />What's bad about BTWN:  Too much mixology...Bowie's warbling lower vocal range.<br /><br />I judge Bowie very much by how he uses his voice and how natural he sounds in each song.  Does the song's arrangement overshadow his voice or distract?<br /><br />The tracks that work for me:<br />- JUMP THEY SAY is one of Bowie's best tracks.  Smouldering underlying passionate pop coated with a deceptively distant veneer.<br />- NIGHT FLIGHT: Bowie sings in the right range for this one<br />- THE WEDDING: A sound and vision type instrumental<br />- MIRACLE GOODNIGHT<br /><br />The tracks that were a little too cute, a little overwrought for me, and which lapse a bit too much into Bowie's sentimental side.<br />- BLACK TIE WHITE NOISE<br />- DON'T LET ME DOWN<br />- I KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOMEDAY<br /><br />The rest are listenable...which leaves us (if you have the BONUS DISC & DVD) with the remixes of JUMP THEY SAY, which is actually better in so many ways and deserves 4 stars ****.  MIRACLE GOODNIGHT is much more transcendental here.  Think Bowie could do with more producers working with him.<br /><br />All in all, Bowie didn't do too badly, but whether this ranks as a glass half empty or half full is up to the listener.<br /><br />(BTW IMHO, Bowie's best album of the 90s would be EARTHLING)full is up to the listener.      (BTW IMHO, Bowie's best album of the 90s would be EARTHLING)
B00004YYDI|5|I adore this film, primarily (though not only) for one reason: Natalie Portman.  Her performance left me with my jaw on the floor for most of the film when I first saw it, and I still can't help but watch her in awe when I load it up again now and then.  Prior to seeing this film, I had only seen her in Phantom Menace, and at the time, I simply couldn't understand what all the fuss about her talent was...her wooden-seeming performance as Princess Amidala left me quite indifferent.  But now that I've seen her incredible brilliance in its most potent form - here in this film when she was still amazingly young, I believe she is indeed one of this generation's greatest and most unique talents.  I am a huge fan of Jean Reno and Luc Bisson as well, but I find that their talents are diluted whenever they are &quot;anglicized/americanized&quot; as in this film.  In their native french, they are both marvels of the screen.  La Femme Nikita is another, better example; I remember hating the american/dubbed version of it, but loving the original.  The plot itself is ok, but nothing spectacular, and as for Gary Oldman, although he can often be wonderful in his performances, in this movie he really misses.  I'm not sure if he took the method school of acting too much to heart and enjoyed some of the drugs that his character did before his scenes, but whatever the reason, &quot;over the top&quot; (as described by many other reviewers) is putting it mildly.<br />As for this uncut version, there is no reason for anyone to own any other version of the film; the american release (&quot;The Professional&quot;) is an insult to both the director's vision and to the audience.  <br />Even now, I have a difficult time watching the ending of this film; it leaves me teary-eyed and with a lump in my throat that doesn't go away for hours, and the primary reason is again Natalie Portman's unbelievable performance.  After watching her in this film, you'll find it almost impossible to believe thatyou're watching a 13/14-year-old actress.  Get this film to witness true acting brilliance in the making; the great action is just a bonus.
B00O0MBPOO|5|As a Long time Doors fan I thought I'd heard it all but feast of friends sheds a whole new light upon Jim Morrison. Interviews with the people who were Jim's friends was fascinating as well as sad to read. From the interviews you gain insights into a very complex but at the same time vulnerable man. A man who cared more about the art and creativity than the fame and fortune. In the end the rock star persona that had been created. Consumed Jim Morrison. It's hard to say why some stars are able to somehow separate the star persona from the normal person that they are and others become consumed by it. And why those closest to it fail to see what's happening or see it and do nothing to stop it. Overall a good book if you are a fan of the Doors.

B004WSV4M4|5|This is one of the most interesting books I have read, summarizing a vast amount of research in archeology, biology, sociology, and geography. Those interested in thinking about patterns in history and comparing East and West, and various empires within East and West, will find this book quite thought provoking. The book hinges on an index of social development the author uses throughout the book to compare different societies over different periods. His appendix explains how he developed this index, and also contains a sensitivity analysis of the key variables that comprise his index, to argue that his index is unlikely to be so far off that it distorts the patterns of history and societies as he has described them throughout the book. The book is quite detailed and for that reason general readers may not enjoy it. But anyone who wants an overview of research in many social science fields should find this book quite interesting. The only mistake I found was on page 510. While the Wright brothers had their first flight in North Carolina, they were from Dayton, Ohio, and only went to North Carolina because of the high winds near the ocean at Kittyhawk, and because the sand dunes there were conducive to their experiments with gliders and then powered aircraft. But this mistake is minor and does not diminish the great accomplishment Dr. Morris has achieved in this most interesting book. Now his other books are on my reading list.
B007OWRBJK|5|A great insight into a brilliant, complex, creative, and sometimes troubled mind. This book really helps understand what makes Pete tick. His blatant honesty is refreshing.

B00FKF0F3C|5|Outstandig.
B00DGNO3WE|3|Maggie Smith ,Billy Connolly , Dustin Hoffman always have my attention. I have been waiting for this film forever . I don't know why. the characters were one dimensional, somewhat stereotypical .If I had to choose the best from the lot, it would be Billy Connolly although his character had no more depth than the others, there is something about his ability to make you forget that it is him onscreen .If you love opera, I mean really love opera. this might interest you, there are some bona fide singers and musicians in the film . if you don't I would pass
B00C74SHRK|5|Very gripping tale, hard to put down, lots of fun to read in one continuous drag. Tartt's best one so far !
B000000P17|4|The last studio album released by Guns n' Roses seemed to have everything missing when it came out, as Izzy Stradlin' had left the band, every track found on the album is a cover, and the music is punk rock. This being true, it was understandable that alot of Guns n' Roses fans would want to avoid this album, expecting it to be far different from the Illusion albums, GNR Lies, and Appetite For Destruction.<br /><br />Although, it is distinctly different in sound, it still offers some very heavy, energetic and exciting punk rock tunes that many GNR fans can appreciate. If you are a fan of punk rock, this album is a great buy because  it gives covers of some classic punk rock groups and artists and gives a poweful, more alternative look at punk rock music with generally heavier guitar riffs.<br /><br />The album kicks off into the delicate, beautiful power ballad, Since I don't have you which is the single off the album. This song has a great flow to it, with an impressive lyrical delivery which never leaves you bored with the song. To follow the first track, Guns n' Roses leaps into the heavier stuff, first with New Rose, and then with the heavy, evil lyrics and riffs of Down on the Farm. As the album moves on, we hear GNR stay fairly consistent with their punk rock selections, despite having a few tracks being weaker than others, in my mind most notably Black Leather.<br /><br />To conclude, I would highly recommend this album to any punk rock fan, since the crew made some excellent choices for the proper songs to cover, and for the most part, gave very strong musical deliveries of each of them. As for Guns n' Roses fans, I myself am a huge fan of their music and am fond of this album, so it certainly wouldn't be a bad idea to give it a try.
B00004XONN|5|I recieved Kid A in the mail yesterday, and listened to it in it's entirety for the first time, and the second, and the third. I'm listening to it at this moment. I can't tear myself away from it. It is the most amazing album I've heard in years. I would put it above its predecessor OK Computer. The only album in the past ten years that I think could be better is Pearl Jam's Ten. I was skeptical about Kid A before I got it. I thought a Radiohead without a strong presence of guitars and without a strong presence of Thom Yorke's amazing voice would be lacking. As soon as I heard &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot;, I knew Radiohead could still amaze with a different style. In the past 30 hours that Kid A has been in my possession, I have come to think that it is possibly the Sgt. Peppers of our time. It is revolutionary. I only hope that it will prove equally influential.

B0086VWCPG|4|Been using MapMyRun for the longest time, but when this came up add the free app of the day, I figured I'd give it a go.<br /><br />Just did my first run with it (a little over 6 miles) and everything seemed accurate, plus I rather liked the extra logging features at the end (running surface, weather, how you're feeling, etc.).<br /><br />I don't have a smartwatch, so I can't attest to that functionality, but it's a nice option to have (I've wanted to get a Pebble, for instance).<br /><br />Only gripe is that it won't sync with Twitter for me, but I suspect that could be an API issue.<br /><br />If it remains stable and reliable, this'll absolutely be my new regular running app!

B004EPZ08E|5|Perhaps this is partly due to the very vocal and very packed theater I saw Horrible Bosses in, but I have to say that it was one of the best experiences I've had watching a comedy in a long time. This movie is funny, really funny. The writing is vulgar and clever, often at the same time. There is not one weak link in the cast. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis play the three main guys getting pushed around by their evil bosses. They then hatch a plan to kill each others bosses. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell play those three evil bosses. You also get other big names like Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland and an unexpected cameo from Bob Newhart. Everyone is great, but I have to give a special props to Jennifer Aniston. We finally get to see her in a role that showcases more of her talent than everything else she has done combined. She's funny, sexy and pulls of some nasty lines with ease.<br /><br />I didn't plan on seeing this today, but I got bored, read some really positive reviews, felt spontaneous and headed to my theater. Best decision I've made in...well today. Forget the latest Hangover and check out one of the best comedies for grown ups in a long time.
B0091REZMW|5|It's a cool game and I enjoy it. I'm not paying anything either. Cool missions, I like the puzzles their addictive.
B003FK8V7G|4|Having listened to this band's output in chronological order--\\"Sink or Swim\\" followed by \\"The '59 Sound\\" followed by \\"American Slang\\"--I finally feel like I've heard the true heart and soul of the Gaslight Anthem.  It's been a slow progression from the Springsteen/Social D clones that appeared on \\"Sink or Swim,\\" and while the journey, at least for me, has been less than enjoyable, it feels good to see this band emerge with an album that both feels and sounds distinctly theirs.  Sure, there are a few hints of their Springsteen-influenced songwriting, most noticeably on \\"The Diamond Church Street Choir\\" and \\"Old Haunts,\\" but the rest of the album takes on a life of its own.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the stand-out track on this record is \\"The Spirit of Jazz.\\"  This is the first Gaslight Anthem song I ever heard, and it's my absolute favorite.  If they could write and play all their songs with this much energy...wow, that would be an album truly worth hearing.  Fortunately, there are other songs with enough strength to support the oh, so obvious lead single:  \\"Boxer,\\" \\"Stay Lucky,\\" and the album's title track.<br /><br />The album ends on a quiet note with the nostalgiac, almost sad \\"We Did It When We Were Young,\\" which comes across as a statement of growth for this young band from Jersey and really helps to round out the record.  It helps to give shape to the overall statement of growth and reflection heard on \\"American Slang\\" and is a big leap forward for the band.  I only hope their next album is at least as good as this.
B004I8WD6E|1|PROS:  fast shipping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I've never used a worst iphone case like this one<br />- Sharp corners and edges, it hurts your hand after 3 minutes of continuous use. This can result in hand injury.<br />- The texture is too hard<br />- Too difficult to take out from iphone<br />- I threw it away after first use<br />- Too thick<br /><br />I don't get it why this product get good reviews. It's sold from Amazon, probably the reviewers are Amazon's employees!<br /><br />This product suppose to get 0/5, but due to fast shipping, it gets 1 star.

B0036S4B6M|5|This is the type of book that you read in order to gain a perspective on something that you think you know- but after delving into it, you realize how much you don't know. It makes a cogent case for prison reform, sentencing guideline reform and the true cost of incarceration. Fascinating, well written and very, very though provoking.
B003XF1XOQ|5|This book was good but I didn't consider it the best of the series. Disappointed at the end and hope the movie is better.
B00025ETIW|3|After hearing the song I'm Not Okay (I Promise) by this band, I was compelled to check out the CD. The song just rocked, and I was hoping for more of the same. To be honest, I was rather disappointed. <br /> <br />I don't know if it was my stereo, or if my copy of the CD is no good, but half the time you can't hear what the singer is saying. I've looked at the lyrics, and they're great, but you just can't hear the words. I tried turning it up and it just made it worse. Perhaps there's something wrong with my CD, but it's given me a bad impression of the band itself. The music is good, but the lyrics are just impossible which takes away from it. <br /> <br />So, if only one song on the CD has lyrics you can hear and understand, it's really not worth the buy. If you can get it to work, though, by all means, buy it.

B00004T9UF|5|This album is important as it offically ushered a new era of hip-hop. In 96', the legend that is 2Pac was murdered, and in March of 97', Biggie was shot down too. For the next 3 years, hip-hop and its music had became dull, and besides a few new commers such as DMX and Busta Rhymes, the genre of this great music was slowly decending downwards as rap was trying to find itself.<br /><br />During this time, a white rapper from Detroit was hiding away, along with Dr. Dre, producing and creating what would be a classic album. That album was however The Slim Shady LP, released in 1999. Although its hailed now as a classic, this album was known, but kind of still a secret back in the hip-hop world in 99'. Em and Dre went at it again, and Aftermath records released The Marshall Mathers LP in May 2000. Not only did this introduce alot of people from the new generation into rap (this, along with Dre's 2001 album were the first two i ever purchased) but it also got hip-hop sough of back on track. The flow, shocking and outragous lyrics, along with intense production and some great beats to go along with Em equaled this album. Personally, its in my top 15. Before this, during the time period of 97' to 99', i could name only 4 really great rap albums, Blackout (Method Man & Redman), 2001 (Dr Dre...it was released in 1999 btw), Slim Shady LP (Em) and Its Dark and Hell Is Hot (DMX)...i know i could think of more, but these 4 come to mind. Only four albums, wow that shows how average and tarnished rap was once it lost Pac and Big. Eminem provided some light for fans like myself.<br /><br />Here are the top 6 tracks from the album:<br /><br />1. Stan (argubly one of the greatest songs of all time, whether if your talking about hip-hop or not, this song is genius, inventive and masterful. This song has everything, from intelligant lyrics to a nice hook to nod your head too....Eminem shows pure greatness in this song)<br /><br />2. Marshall Mathers (an Em classic. The beat is so horrocore, as are the lyrics and the flow. Some of Dr. Dre's best production work is right here in this song. Eminem raps about the haters, and how they have gone from douting him, to loving him. Em however gives them the middle fingervand basically says i don't need you on the bandwagon. Epic tune, and a top 10 track by him)<br /><br />3. Bitch Please II (this reminds me of both 'Whats the Difference' and 'Forgot About Dre', the tracks from Dre's 2001 album. It features a fast-pased bassy beat, and has guest vocals and verses provided by Snoop, Dre, Xzibit and Nate Dogg. Definatly a classic song, which brings the Aftermath fam together)<br /><br />4. Criminal (a song with a nice skit type intro in which Em addresses his more annoying fans and critics, and then the beat drops, and its seriously amoung my top 10 beat samples of all time. The lyrics follow the theme of the songs title, being a criminal)<br /><br />5. Kill You (a similar song to Criminal, in which its fast paced and both follow the same style of meaning. Really good song, and with it being the first full lengh song on the album, it sets the pace for the album)<br /><br />6. The Real Slim Shady (a classic Eminem track. A great single. It follows the same comedic values as his song 'Without Me')<br /><br />A truly great album..,
B00942OO7U|4|It was a good movie to watch...
B0001A79JO|4|I've been listening to this album for a couple of days now and I'm really digging it.  Its bouncy and fun.  There's enough variation in the tracks so that they don't all sound the same and the energy is good.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it is so catchy and so \\"pop\\" that I'm afraid I'll get burned out on it.  I'm not sure why some people wrote that they liked the first half of the album but not the second half.  \\"Dotted With Hearts\\" has a great sound, like listening to music from \\"Grease\\" with power.  The surf sound of \\"Horrorbeach\\" is cool and \\"Emotional Abuse\\" is really sultry.  Well, everyone is different.  I'd recommend this album.  I've sent copies to a couple other people already.
B0050SYS5A|1|Like others, when this product was attached to the Kinect, the sensor couldn't determine where the floor was, so it would settle pointing upward.  I have my Kinect positioned under the TV as recommended, but the Zoom simply did not work even after I did all of the recommendations I could find on the Net about making this thing function as designed.  I dropped it off at the post office to be sent back to Amazon less than an hour after it was delivered.  Really good idea...just didn't work.
B00DJFIMW6|5|great
B00006WUWN|4|The title says it all, mayBe if she wasn't in it it would have been a classic. Her acting skills are horrible, why would they bring her on for this role. Without her in the way the film still stands as a very funny and imaginitive comedy. All the characters from the past show up in this all out comedic warfare. Including one of my favorite actors seth green returns for his brilliant preformance. Jay rouch did an excellant job directing this film, and mike myers and michael mccullers wrote a very funny script. The only thing that seems strange is that with only two executive producers there are eight producers, two of which are writer/actor mike myers and demi moore. but with that aside take beyonce out and you have a comedy classic.

B000NY12LO|5|I am may not have read all the classics but this book has a lot of classic plots. i have read some of the other reviews for this book and some have been not well thought through at all. This book is about a teenage girl named Josie and her &#34;friend&#34; Peter and what you would sacrafice for a friend. This is a classic topic for books as I presume because Ive only read a few. One review I read was very mean to be put simply. I would like you to write a book people who thought this book was bad to write one yourself. Anyhow the reason i liked this book so much was beacause it showed that no matter who you are and what the circumstances that friendship will prevail. Or we like to think.

0385534639|5|The Night Circus, is Erin Morgenstern's debut Novel. It is hard to believe.<br /><br />The novel is a complex work, often, especially at the beginning, composed of what seem to be vignettes instead of chapters. As one progresses through the book the the vignettes become more cohesive. I was out on a friend's sail boat when I understood the real magnificence of the book and thought of an analogy: When I was a teen I spent the summer in Spain and many of the older women in the town we stayed in, passed the afternoon making lace. To me, it seemed like magic--pins on a pillow attached to wooden sticks the women tossed around the way a dealer in Las Vegas handles playing cards. What seems to be merely a potential tangled mess and all but incomprehensible is, through the lace maker's skill, turned into fabric by what, to the untrained eye looks like nothing less than magic.<br /><br />This novel is like making lace. Morgenstern takes these many, seemingly disparate threads and with what must be a magical skill itself, turns it into a book filled with wonder.<br /><br />The Night Circus is actually about a circus. And, the circus is nothing that could exist in our world. Indeed, to me it is impossible that the entirety lived in Morgenstern's mind. As I read, Morgenstern reminded me of Jorge Luis Borges.<br /><br />The actual circus, the Cirque des Rêves, (The Circus of Dreams) is managed through the energy of several people. There is no spoiler here. From the first page magic is intrinsic to the story. As fantasy it is not meant to be substituted for reality but is allegorical.  Magic, love, anger, selflessness and selfishness are acted upon and all result in serious unforeseeable outcomes. But, whenever we play with fate it's likely to have unforeseen consequences. In a world governed by scientific thought every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In a magical world every action has an infinite number and type of reactions.<br /><br />There are two characters we come to know best: Celia and Marco. Their fates have been manipulated, cruelly for what could be called entertainment or a trial. We come to know corollary characters as well, The Allen Twins, Poppet ad Widget, the young boy from Massachusetts, Bailey Clarke whose first taste for the circus brought him astonishing choices, the two masters whose feud has resulted in the manipulation of Celia's and Marco's lives and endangering of the entire circus family.<br /><br />The circus itself will enchant and delight you almost as much as it does the people in the story who attend it. It transcends the laws of physics.<br /><br />There are slow parts and some of the more atmospheric vignettes could go.

B005CRQ4GU|4|I think this book was great I just wish the book was not so short other than that great read
0553208845|5|Exactly what I ordered.Fast delivery.Thank you.
B00097A5HW|4|\\"Fijacion Oral\\" is a new album from Shakira, who became an internatinal pop-star, let's face it, after becoming a blonde hottie. After rather disappointing, however best-selling \\"Laundry Service\\", Shakira finally comes back with a fresh breeze of originality. \\"Fijacion Oral\\" offers variety of genres and moods, reflecting Shakira's own musical taste. This time she certainly feels no pressure from the record label and is allowed to sing what she really feels like, with her rough unpolished, yet warm voice. The singer gets back to her roots with solid song writing. Very enjoyable music for the hot summer days.
630575067X|2|&quot;Star Wars:  Episode I - The Phantom Menace&quot; is the much-anticipated prequel to the everlastingly popular &quot;Star Wars&quot; series.  I thought it was going to be much better than it was.  The special  effects were good, but overly flashy.  The presence of the annoying Jar Jar  Binks wasn't needed and just took away from the development of the other  characters.  The acting was good, but the story was lacking that certain  &quot;Star Wars&quot; element that audiences have been accustomed to with  &quot;A New Hope,&quot; &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; and  &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot;  It's entertaining enough, but what  happened here!
B00AKFG15S|4|A real cliff hanger again, typical of Jeffrey Archer.  I've enjoyed all 3 so far, and can't wait for number 4 of the Clifton Chronicles.
B00HVJB4VM|4|As one of the so-called 'technologists', I have a mild interest in finance and a far greater one in computing and its broad societal, ecological and economical impacts. For quite some time, I was reading newspapers' articles about HFT but I had never quite understood what it really was and it's role within the stock market economy.<br /><br />Now that I've finished reading Flash Boys, I feel enlightened. I also feel respectful for the work of the people at IEX and I sincerely hope that the move they made will benefit the larger economy. Flash Boys is not cast in the typical, oversimplified black-or-white good-or-bad mold. The author does a great job showing that its subject is intricate and complex and there is no clear-cut opinion to be made with regard to many of the matters surrounding HFT, including the regulations that somehow gave birth to it.<br /><br />The book suffers from very minor editing errors that didn't get in the way of its well-constructed flow. Still, I think it would have been better with a few diagrams to illustrate the strategies adopted by HFT to front-run others as I found myself reaching for a pencil and a piece of paper now and then to make my own. On second thought, it might have been the author's purpose to give his readers a chance to make their own drawings to foster long-term memory activation.<br /><br />Some passages were hard to swallow and rereading them helped. From my perspective, this is yet another sign of the author's craftsmanship for tackling some obtuse aspects of his subject matter without getting caught in the oversimplification trap.
B00IUBXPEY|4|Very good movie, the ending was a bit abrupt. I think the reason for the ending was to make a sequel.
B009MCRHH6|5|Wonderfully challenging
B002SR3T10|4|Very good CD. If you are a fan of Jethro Tull you will like this CD. Has the Typical Tull sound.
B005CRQ4GU|5|I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read or also anyone who does not like to read. I love it!!
B00D2BHO44|5|The music in this soundtrack is amazing. I love listening to the music in game and wanted to hear it when I'm not playing. Beautiful music to write to or just chill out. I would recommend it to fans of the game or fans of good instrumental music. It is well worth the money.
B0015D3Z4O|5|Once more Madonna brings another album that shows that she really has a flawless talent. Every album that she records takes us on a tour of a renovated Madonna but obviuosly, with her same roots.  Her previous album \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" from my point of view was one of her greatest productions, (I found \\"American life\\" not good).  \\"Hard candy\\" has a more commercial sound. It has contribuitions of big names in the american music business such as Pharrell Willimas, Timbaland, Kanye West and Justin Timberlake. All the songs sound fresh and have great rhythms. The opennig track, \\"Candy shop\\" gives the album's tittle and is fun. My favorite track on this album is \\"Give it 2 me\\" next to Pharrell. It is a song that makes you feel like deancing, another great tune is \\"Beat goes on\\" next to Kanye West. \\"Dance 2tonight\\" is one of the songs with less rhythm but still very good. Actually the whole album is very good, after listening it you'll like it more and well,  if you like Madonna there isn't much to say, it is all history.  What I would like to comment as an advice, is that if you are hesitating about either buying the simple or special release version, buy the simple one. I have the special package and it doesn't include anything special. The box is very big (hard to put next to other cd's) and has the same pictures. The only extras are 2 remixes from \\"4 minutes\\" (the remixes are good but nothing really special) and a small bag of candies.
B00003CWOL|4|Kevin used an aggressive approach to his newest release Dogma.  Coming out of the movie theater people had mixed reviews.  Lets not kid ourselves...any movie about religion is going to offend some people.  Just  take the film as to the context in for which it was meant for and you get a  superbly done comedy filled with an all-star cast of up and coming actors  and established talent. Well written and great camera shots.  HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED!
B001Q9J4PG|5|Always a good choice, because it is full of interesting facts, suspense, and in general a great read. Highly recomend.
B000MR9D5E|5|Excellent condition. Didnt take too long to get to me. I was very satisfied with the service!
B00FJTWK0U|5|The first film is hopeful and full of the promise associated with young love.<br /><br />The second film shows the characters as more grounded. They are certainly more mature, but that hardly stops them from aspiring to true love. That is what makes Before Sunset so meaningful. Both characters instinctively knew the other is their counterpart, and they act upon that with sincere appreciation.<br /><br />The third film is a test of that love. Married couples are better at speaking to this, but even love is not enough to overcome the myriad challenges associated with long-term relationships. It helps that the characters, in particular, Celine, are both quite intelligent and worldly. They have problems. The simplest argument can devolve into a grudge match over one or the other's intentions. But they still recognize how it would be to live without the other. I like to think it is because of this that they are able to reconcile. It is not sufficient to love one another. Each has to understand the price of loss. It is a price they both paid the first time they separated (i.e. soon after Before Sunrise). And it is a price neither would be willing to pay again.
B00N1HONIO|5|This is amazing,no killing, no blood, only jumpscares. I recommend you should get this. Like I said I LOVE THE GAME!!!!!!!!
B0060MYM7O|5|We are enthralled with the complex interweaving of stories. The drama, intrigue, betrayals, loyalties honor and evil all presented in the most luxurious or desparate of circumstances.
0399167064|5|I really enjoyed this book. It started off a bit slow for me, but I really loved the characters once I read more and more. It was a different style of writing than I am used to, but I liked the little 'interviews' put in throughout the book. Really kept me guessing! It was a great book with a nice twist at the end! I didn't see the Perry/Saxon thing coming! I am going to read more of her books now. This was my first one by Liane Moriarty!
B0026IUXME|5|I would say it's a classic (which is), if it were not that it's stuff that happened for real, back when most of us weren't even born. This movie caused me tons of sorrow and I also felt compelled to read part of the real diary from the man himself, Mr. Szpilman. There's just so much anyone can learn from a movie like this. What it means to be separated from your family knowing that they are all going to be killed. What it means to live in the direst of condition for the rest of your days. What it means to be humiliated by these monstrously insensitive individuals called 'Nazi'.  There's nothing that anyone can write to express all these ideas. This is a movie that all grown ups should see, to grow up more. Stop watching Marvel movies, stop watching movies to entertain yourself, and watch this movie to learn something. I learned to try, everytime I am angry or sad about something that has to do with my own disappointments, to remember what it must have meant to be one of the victims of Nazism. Go to wikipedia and read the article about Czesawa Kwoka and you too will learn to tend to complain a lot less.  Nazism. The shame of humanity.  UPDATE: I have now read the whole diary. I must say, there's no substitute for that. It's too easy to watch a movie, you should read the book too.
B007EECSFA|5|The best from first sentence to last
B00ICN066A|5|Excellent ideas and arguments, and just so well written. Hugely enjoyable — will certainly give you much to think about.
B00F1BFRA6|5|Just like the othres in the series this season was well up to scratch it continues the great productions as always a delight for fans<br />very enjoyable.
B00L9B7IKE|5|We've all had moments when we dream fantasy lives for neighbors or people we see by random encounters.  However, as normal people we don't become obsessed. In Paula Hawkins debut psychological thriller, The Girl on the Train, the characters sway far from ordinary.  The story is conveyed by three narrators, all women with extraordinary characteristics: The lead narrator, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic with memory lapses so large the reader will struggle to know who she is (as Rachel cannot remember for herself and must rely on the accounts of others to piece her days back together). Megan Hipwell is a woman with so many secrets and past lives the reader is left wondering what has she yet to let us in on and will we ever know all of her secrets. And finally a sugary, manipulative woman, Anna Watson, who seems to be struggling to lead an ordinary life but her actions leave the reader wondering which side of Anna will ultimately win out in the end.  Rachel Watson's life has not turned out in the manner of which she had dreamed, far from it actually. Rachel had an opportunity for a storybook happy ending: a loving husband, a job, a home and plans for a family. How then, did everything go so wrong? If only she could remember. Rachel's daily commute to London takes her past the life that she lost to alcoholic blackouts, stopping at a signal just behind her old neighborhood where her world went awry. So painful is seeing her former home, now shared by her ex- husband, his new wife and their child, Rachel focuses instead on a couple living a few houses down. She gives life to the neighbors she might have had, fantasizing them into a perfect, beautiful and happy couple, even assigning them poetic names. Until one day Rachel spies a scene from the train that shatters the dream she has assigned the couple. Rachel learns the next morning (after one of her drunken stupors) that the fantasy woman, Meagan Hipwell, has been reported missing. As Rachel pieces together the events of the prior evening, she discovers that she was in fact in the neighborhood at the time the woman was last reported having been seen. Taking on the self-proclaimed role of \\"Nancy Drew\\" she begins investigating the disappearance of Megan Hipwell. She must first, however, play sleuth to her own whereabouts and actions of the night in question.  Megan Hipwell is bored. She has reinvented herself so many times over that she no longer knows who she is and what she really wants. She should be happy. Megan has a doting husband and beautiful home. Why then does she seek situations that could rip her world apart and dream of running away, yet again?  Anna Watson has gotten everything she wanted. She was the mistress that won. She got the husband, the home and the beautiful baby. Now she wants the one nuisance in her life gone, the ex-wife, Rachel Watson.  No one knows what goes on behind closed doors and lives dreamed up while on passing trains rarely correlate with what is happening inside the mysterious abodes.  Narration from the story's orators are scrambled but well done. As the pieces of the story start to fall into place, the reader will turn page after page to learn more.  The women in this novel are unreliable, calculating and flighty, and the men are unquestionably flawed. It is difficult to find anything in common with these characters or genuinely likable for that matter. The unlikelihood of them all being entwined however, is what will keep the reader chugging along.
B00AREIAI8|5|Just started playing and I'm already hooked. Though, it wouldn't let me change the user of mine or type numbers. It always says invalid user for every single thing I put.
B008B68J2G|5|My daughter is a HUGE monster high fan. Loves all their stuff. This was a great buy and great price
0143118420|1|I couldn't force myself to finish it. I stopped reading at page 48. Yep, that early. I skimmed ahead to see if it would get better and it didn't so thats when I called it quits. I became very annoyed by her because she portrayed herself as this sad pathetic divorcee but then she would scatter little passages around about her good looks or her skinny figure or about how wealthy she is or some know it all attitude to make herself feel above her readers. It was just really pathetic to me. Yes, it is a memoir, but I really couldn't stand her.
B00ABKGG0C|5|There are so many reviews here I will keep this brief. I took to the main character quickly after reading the first few pages of this book. This is an intelligently mapped out story of a grounded character with great integrity and depth amidst a world of barbarianism and layers of sophisticated intrigue. The story is unpredictable and never lags. Whether an event, a revelation, a plot twist, a new character, or intense action ...something awaits as another levels off. The author manages to cover a lot of ground where other authors might have been tedious driving a point across. This is a fine introduction to a series I will be looking forward to.
B004LWZWGK|5|Although I don't plan on using the UV digital copy, I do not find it necessary to rate this movie 1 star! It is an awesome action movie that closes one story while opening up another.<br />Plus, there is the viewing experience! Booming explosions, great acting, suspenseful plot, amazing special effects...what more could you want? I personally like this movie much more than Batman Begins, but not as much as I love the Dark Knight. Having said that, this movie is absolutely worth the buy.<br />Please stop rating it 1 star for the UV copy!
B008MM9630|4|this game is good. you have to figure some of it out for yourself. I think the tutor should be more in depth
B00006JDVV|4|Sure, it was cheesy and low budget, but the indomitable Rob Bowman didn't pull any punches in this futeristic drama about dragons. Giving a scientific edge to a creature based in fantasy, this film proved to be a rather refreshing step in science fiction, which means it won't be a well received one. I really love seeing those dragons flying in the air they look so real breathing fire.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|So addictive!!! My cousin referred it to me, now I can't put it down. Get get app. It is not a waste of space.
B00XOX9QCS|5|Absolutely amazing !!!!!
B001KVZ6HK|4|great story line  very good 3d action  i'm glad it's in our 3d  library
B002BWP49C|5|It is exactly what I asked for. Couldn't find the movie anywhere in stores. My husband found it on here.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Awesome app.  I don't like in app purchases in a game, but the quality of this game is amazing.  Stunning 3D graphics, flawless gameplay.  Easy enough to manuever that my kids can play, but challenging enough for me to enjoy.  I love that every time you restart the run, you get a knew scenerio (not the same boring run).  Thank you Gameloft!  Another Grand Slam!
B004SIP8SY|5|I love the Kill Bill movies. I love Quentin Tarentenos movies. They are all awesome, and I would recommend them to anyone. :)
B00N1HONIO|5|I'm on night 4 and can't make it to night 5, so I'll need some tips...
B005GFPZYK|5|Awesome book. Second time I have read it. Very insightful. It not only shows what the warriors go through but their families also.
B00U65KQMQ|5|Plays everything I've thrown at it, haven't had any hassles. Streaming is an issue, but that seems to be more of a hardware issue than software.
141971189X|5|My son read this book in a matter of hours!
B00NAPEAQC|4|Liked this game a lot.  Easy to play and just fun.
B0094LU2TU|5|This is one of those &#34;signpost&#34; films - it's significant in being one of the first of it's kind that's unabashedly not US-focused (set in South Africa), filmed in a gritty, realistic, news footage / documentary style; and for focusing less on what the aliens are, where they came from, or why they are here, and more on the (relative to the preceding questions) mundane issue of literally what would people do with 1MM stranded alien refugees. Specifically, it focuses on how human society would almost assuredly do the wrong thing at every opportunity, while lying and covering up the truth. A sci-fi political drama. Plus the effects and action are top notch. Great stuff.<br /><br />More films are now spending less of the limited story telling time explaining how their particular sci-fi universe came to be the way it is, and more time focusing on a specific and compelling sub-story within that universe.
B005LY4B0A|5|Good concept, good execution, good game play.  Addictive game and can be frustrating at times.  The hint feature could be better.  It is nice that it encourages you to try harder but the fact it gives the entire solution kind of sucks.  I would like it better if you earned hints through successful completion of a level, and it only gives 1 move per hint.
B00MI4SGHA|5|Happy user for years, lots of info
B004MC8CA2|5|This app has helped make daily reading easy.  This version seems to work better then my iPhone version.  iPhone app has unresolved bugs...
0547569653|5|I've read the book once and immediately started reading it again.  I have bookmarks all throughout so that I can go back and try some of the recipes Scott mentions in the book.  Wonderful, thoughtfully written book!
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is awesome. I am addicted to it I can not stop playing it.<br />If you like addicting games then this is the game for you.
B0095ZMMCK|5|good return to action of the Ryan characters. I only wish that these books came more often. I appreciated that even though Clancy uses help from other authors he stays true to his style when using well known characters.
B00BMKDTNC|5|A grabbing read, just couldn't stop until finished reading. So sorry that there won't be more of this great saga.
B008A1NSTG|5|I can't wait till I watch this movie again.  I love how so many different people from around the world came together for a common goal: to save the whales.
B00BSBR9N6|5|This book was fun from beginning to end. Don is such a lovable character... Despite his socially abnormal behavior. I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys romance or just a plain good story.
B00T47ZXIE|5|Great movie!
B00AMBK0X4|5|great movie lol the hole time. kept me watchin . going to watch again and again.comedy of the year #1
B004SH40BQ|5|really works
159315724X|5|An excellent book with some incredibly simple life changing ideas.  Well written by the editor of Success magazine.  Easy to read.  Simple stories that make sense and fit easily into your daily life.  Well worth picking up a copy. Giving as a gift to graduates, newly weds, and anyone who needs to jumpstart their income, their lives, and their success.
B004WE01YA|4|I was so excited to see this wonderful film now in stunning 3D.  I recently bought a Sony 3D tv only to find that my current blu ray player had to be changed to a 3d blu ray player in order to watch 3d movies.  Being in the UK the multi region 3D disc and bluray discs work fine.  However as the UK is in a different region the DVD disc is not playable unless you happen to have a multiregion player.  All in all buying from the USA is a bit expensive as I had to pay international postage and 16.00GBP  customs duty in addition to the original price.  I love this film and it is currently unavailable in 3D yet highly sought after in the UK so the extra cost was worth it.  Getting a parcel all the way from America is somehow even more exciting.  It took around 2 weeks to arrive,  3D is amazing but 3D Disney films are out of this world!    Thanks for reading and enjoy the film.  Please rate as helpful.  Thank you!
B00BVMXBDO|1|did not even make it thru the 1st episode. save your money.
B00CWY76CC|4|I loved the app Can You Escape,but it only had 10 levels. After I beat all the levels I replayed all of them and then just deleted the app because I saw no point why to have it. So if you're looking for a new,fun,challenging game this is the one. But beware it only has 10 levels. Im just glad it's free.
B00B0ZT9NI|3|Felt like the movies hype set the bar too high. I did enjoy the film and definitely has a good story.
B0071XO8RA|4|Greatly enjoyed this post-apocalyptic page turner. A trip to the Deep Down of a world struggling to survive toxins both within and without.
B006GLLXXK|5|Just love this show. And it's so over the top it's funny.
B008MM9630|5|I love this game def give it a 5 star because it has cute graphics and is very relaxing to play.
B006885EFE|4|We take much for granted today in this country. Freedom is not free. We owe a great debt to people of virtue who would rather fight than switch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I loved the characters and the story had some unexpected twists and turns.  Can't wait to read more by this author.
B00023B1LC|5|super cool dude !!
B007N8RULO|5|This version is better than other Spider Solitaire apps for Kindle. It has great graphics. I deleted my other apps.
B007IXWKUK|5|Could not but it down. I am off to buy the last book, can't wait to see what happens next.
B00T40UK20|5|Replacement came , works great!
B00594XOZU|5|Kik is amazing I use it everyday u can text ur friends if they have it I defently recommend it....
B00280LYHS|4|This book is a great read. I like how he made the Greek myths come to modern times. Great read.
0446530573|5|Bought this as a gift for my grown son who is a chef and a big fan of the Sopranos HBO series. He's made several of the recipes and it very happy with it.
0452298482|5|Everybody should read this book. I love it and will not lend it out!!
B009MCRHH6|5|Awesome Game. Hours of fun. Very challenging. Hope they make more levels or World of Goo Too. Sooooo worth the money.
B009ZQC7MY|5|By far the saddest season ever. Still a fantastic show tho! Can't get enough Downton Abby! Let's hope everyone renews their contracts for season number 4.
B008UX8G5A|4|Weir manages to take decades of fact and entangled English lineage creates a very readable story.
B0037VNX44|5|Tom Hardy is riveting in his performance of Britain's most famous inmate. Brutal at times and thought provoking. From the beginning it draws you in.
B0009HKH6Q|3|3.5 Stars. Steve McQueen is always interesting to see on screen. He doesn't disappoint here. Fay Dunaway is also excellent. The bank robbery heist is not really that complicated, and seems implausible in any case. Of course, security in the late 1960s was not what it is today. Nevertheless, it is not very believable that the pinpoint timing/planning required for the heist could be done from afar by Thomas Crown. (The guard's security door wasn't locked? Not really too believable, but was sort of critical to the heist.)<br />The overuse of split-screen effects are certainly a product of the 1960s. You know this is a film from the 1960s. Trying new things, etc. But, the effect, in retrospect, is very distracting and was not a benefit to the film. Consider it as a time capsule in the history of film. Not all things historical are good.<br />The fact that the Dunaway character immediately identifies herself to McQueen as an insurance investigator (and, his enemy) is an interesting twist in a heist film not usually seen (at least, I can't recall any others). So, the two main characters are playing cat-and-mouse (or &#34;playing chess&#34;) throughout the film.  This is where McQueen shines. (Personally, if I were him, I would stay far away from the investigator out of a sense of fear. But, I guess that was part of his desire for thrills, to ward away the boredom.) It would have been a benefit to have developed the characters more, rather than just see them ride around in a dune buggy, kiss, lay on the beach, etc.<br />So, overall, this film is worth seeing for the swaggering McQueen acting. The heist  is a bit simplistic. The characters are not deeply developed - especially McQueen. (Why was he so bored as to want to amuse himself by committing heists, when he had plenty of money already?) The split-screen artifacts are tiresome and distracting. There is no hard evidence that the investigators can use against T. Crown. So, the tension is really derived from whether T. Crown will give up, in the name of love. Or, whether Dunaway's character will give up on her quest to convict him, in the name of love.
B000FBFN1U|5|Wow. After just thinking the first 2 were ok/pretty good, A Storm of Swords was the kicker. I truly fell in love with the series in this book.<br />Is it possible that up until now I was just trying to get through because I already knew what happened? Maybe? But this book is where we see a bit more of people becoming who they are meant to be. Characters aren't great unless they evolve somehow. Static characters don't stick with you. GRRM's characters are quite dynamic.<br />There characters you love to hate and those you hate to love, but not many you'll feel indifferent about, especially after this book!<br />The plot twists will make your head spin! Just when you think you've had all you can take, there's a ton more intrigue, drama and betrayal thrown at you. This is the book during which my husband thought there was something wrong with me because I kept reacting to events out loud. It was so hard not to! You need someone else who has read these so you can discuss.<br />I went right from book one to book two and right from two to three. I took a week off for lighter fare after this because this book was so intense. That is a good thing. i had to let it process and mull it over before I could move on. Huzzah, GRRM! Well done, indeed.
B001FQIWSK|5|Visually stunning, The Fall may be one if the most beautiful and most gut wrenching movies I've ever seen. Lee Pace is a master. Catinca Untaru's performance had me laughing and crying within the same breath. I'm confused as to why this movie is not more well known or more critically acclaimed than it is.
B00BQ1DBUS|5|Great CD! If you love Rod Stewart then this is a must have to add to your collection. Highly recommend.
B000000QFV|4|Despite being from neither the  Ozzy nor the Dio led era, this is some strong  Sabbath, behind some great vocal work from Tony Martin.  Continuing the tendency toward a variety of metal more closely associated with power metal than with the menacing doom metal tendencies of their earliest years or the more experimental material from the later half of the Ozzy era, Sabbath puts out an album that is fast paced and aggressive, and it genuinely sounds as if they're enjoying making the music on this album.
B0010SKSTO|4|Very well written, with good pictures. Doesn't go into amazing detail about specific things, but then again, that would ruin the fun of finding those things oneself. Very good for an introductory peice to reading others. Just don't expect to get good at it overnight; it takes a lot of skill.
0684800713|5|My generation found its spokesman in Kurt Cobain. Though mine is lost for reasons entirely different from Hemingway's, the need for expression and recognition is as strong as ever. But I think in this book Hemingway offers insight that all our &quot;American Beauty's&quot; couldn't hope to achieve. His characters endure for reasons they don't realize. Life is miserable, or at best empty. Jake Barnes and Lady Brett exhibit &quot;grace under pressure&quot; as Hemingway himself defined it. Ironically, for me, this novel is a reminder of the good stuff in life. Hemingway doesn't offer much hope through the dialogues between his noble characters, but in an optimism wholly uncharacteristic of his writing, he offers us a reminder, or the title. The sun isn't always setting, sealing disappointment and despair as it falls, but it also rises. Even when we can't see the reasons, through the enduring actions that endear Barnes and Brett to us we can at least hope.

B00HV2KU5A|5|I bought this DVD in Blu Ray for my daughter she absolutely loves it. I'm very pleased with the quality of this product.
B000FIMG68|5|A very good follow up to the first season. Season had one of the most shocking twists and moves on tv. A show that kept you guessing and wantuing more. A big betrayal happens to our main players. You learn more about Jack, Sawyer, Kate and the other surviors of the plane crash. More Flashbacks, Smoke monters and you meet some of the Others( people who are on the island that are taking them out) . This was a very good show. A must watch
B00EEPFRGE|5|I won't add more comments about the music as it's already been said better than I could say it, but have you guys noticed the packaging of this release?  So not only did the band take the time and care to put the greatest material ever on this record, but the packaging of the CD is top notch in a world where cost cutting is rampant.  And has anyone mentioned the additional DVD that is included with the interviews about the making of the record as well as two  music videos?  I was blown away by this package and I will be buying extra copies to give as Christmas gifts this year.  Keep Rockin, Stryper!!!
1401937535|5|this truly is a book everyone should read.  It is very inspiring and life changing (for the better).<br />I recommend this book to everyone.
B00BD99JMW|5|This book was by far superior to other books I've read.  It kept me at the end of my seat, wanting to find out the fate of everything.  The series has intrigued me and left me emotionally damaged XD. Still, I have no regrets in reading this book.
B0083ZBW2Y|4|Truly an amazing book! With a depressing end, but a book as great as that, you learn to ignore the downsides!
B00VFTD43A|5|Very interesting and poignant at the same time.

0812550706|5|This is one of the best books I've ever read. So far I've lent it to at least a dozen friends and family members, and they've all loved it, too.<br />Ender is a character you'll never forget.
1503280292|5|Little Women is a favorite book from my childhood.  I reread it as an adult a few years ago, and now purchased it for my personal library.<br /><br />Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy...and their mother, whom they call Marmee, are wonderful characters that reveal much about the morals and values of the time.
B0051QIGP4|5|[[ASIN:B004K4AUZW Born This Way (Special Edition)]]<br />patience is what you need especially there's a lot of people downloading the album, where else can you find an album for only 0.99? now it was just released yesterday and for less than a dollar! of course amazon will have some technical difficulties! back to the album, i like it! so happy to buy it! now am gonna listen to it!

B005LY4B0A|5|love it simply beautiful ,however I had some installation. problem at the beginning,need compatible issue  fixed . worth spent money on
B001ER4CNY|5|This series is in my top 10 maybe top 5 favorite series. Great cast and overall fun series to watch.<br />It may seem a little pricey but you are getting five seasons and many hours of viewing fun.<br />The packaging is not adequate and you will probably want to keep the disks in sleeve case for storage.<br />Good quality transfer as far as video and audio, with some limited extras.<br />If you want to add a good comedy series to your collection, I highly recommend this set.<br />All of the disks are single sided with season number on the label side.<br />I would recommend you get it while you can.
B009HV2JT8|3|i personally felt this lincoln was a better fit than the lincoln from the self titled movie. it was a fairly interesting story but it seemed to drag on.
B006PKQQJS|3|its to hard to click on the characters on the s4
B001H1SVO8|3|Kind of a bizarre story line...
B00BHMETKC|3|Relatively good acting and compelling story. My problem is the infusion of political spin to minimally criticize the total ineptitude of the Carter administration in handling the situation.  Moreover, the end of the movie includes dialog by Carter on how wonderful his diplomacy was to allow the release of the hostages.  Simply, the hostages were released on Reagan's inauguration day 1981 because the Iranians knew that the proper methods would be used to extract our citizens!  Moreover, the filmmakers try to denigrate the Shah to somehow justify the takeover of the embassy.  I look forward to Affleck's future movie on Benghazi!

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but, as I say, I'm receiving the message that Kindle has loaded, but I can find no evidence of it. What a waste of time!!!
B00A8ECU24|3|Very pretty and cute. But hate having to take so much time to build up money or bits.  Not a fan of being tempted to pay real money to get extra play coins.  Games of toss ball and Apple catch get monotonous.  Still, I do enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|3|i like this game but I do easily lose interest in it after a while. its fun the games but are either hard or easy
B000UCEJEQ|5|Annie Lennox never disappoints me.  As usual, this is another GREEAT CD for her.  Her voice is top-knotch, the arrangements are excellent and her back-up is always the best.  I listened to this for the first time out for a short walk and wound up walking (briskly, I might add!) so much longer than I had anticipated due to the great beat.  Lennox energizes, excites and exhilarates. A wonderful CD - enjoy!
B00B7Y0206|1|I clicked on it by accident and it would not let me cancel it, what a pain this was. Won't use it

B008RJ6TTC|5|I am a huge Columbo fan!! I've missed seeing the mystery episodes just to keep us reminded of the great work. I was browsing my Amazon wish list and there it was Colombo the Complete Series for $ little of nothing. My husband and I are extremely impressed wih the quality, clarify and The Complete Series. Thank you so much for this great item at a really good price and as usual Amazon is a great E-tailer
B004VMUS9G|5|I love this app. How ingenious to force me to do math before I can hit snooze. That wakes me because I am using a whole different part of my brain. I've told all my friends about it. One called me a nerd...like it was a bad thing :)
B008FPOIT6|5|This is a great book for a teen. Even though the story is fiction there are tons references to actually technology.  An example is references tons of Google advancements.
B00005A1VH|5|Since this was the very first movie my beloved grandfather ever saw in a movie theater, I knew it was going to be in our film library.  We watch it every year and we love Gary Cooper's portrayal so much.  Another good one for children to watch.
B000WZAE0Y|3|Stardust is cute, fun, and imaginative.  It was a little boring at times, but over-all, I enjoyed watching it.
B000RIHBIE|4|Okay, I love Sum 41 for a very similar reason as other fans. My favorite songs are \\"Still Waiting\\", \\"Over My Head\\", \\"Hell Song\\", etc. Of course I was disappointed when I fisrt heard this album, but 1)after listening several times, I am becoming more and more fond of the songs and 2)change (and trying different things) is called \\"growth\\". When we experience growth, it's not always positive, but it's a process of maturing. I'm actually glad that after almost 10 years, Sum 41 is trying different styles instead of doing the same music all the time. If you are a fan, my advice is to give them a chance and watch them go through stages of growth, for better or for worse. If you listen to this album with generous and open mind, I promise you will become fond of the songs too. Change and growth don't have to be disappointing. And my final analysis is that I am not disappointed in this album.
B00AF6B22E|5|I love anything Denzel!

B00CNQ7CRI|4|I think the first two books were good.  But this is stretching it a bit for Bridget.  Read if you just want to follow up on Bridget.
0316055433|5|Tartt's characters are well drawn.  Manhattan, Las Vegas & Amsterdam -- come to life.  But, the thing I loved the most about this book was the beautiful writing.  Wonderful phrasing.  Author hits nails on their heads page after page.  There's element of \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" in that characters cross across social & economic lines.  So many vivid scenes and a page turner.<br /><br /> An exceptional book & I recommend it w/o reservation.

B0070UFMOW|3|The amplifier works fine while it lasts. I didn't use for about a month and now it doesn't work anymore.<br />I contacted the seller and, given that I purchased the refurbished one, the warranty lasts less. They just informed me that and didn't provide any kind of help or guidance or suggestions as to how to solve the problem.<br /><br />Maybe I'm too used to Amazon's \\"above & beyond\\" style, but I consider this bad service.<br /><br />Also, be careful because seems like these items don't last long. Many reviews point to the same. If you buy it, it's worth it to pay more and get it straight from Amazon.
B00BAXFECK|5|This book is unusual by today's fiction standards.<br />It holds your interest.<br />The characters are people one would want to hang out with for a very short time.<br />It is easy to put down some of the time but in other parts one must finish the scene so to speak.<br />Potter is a very interesting character and his comings and goings often keep you guessing.<br />I found it to be a very enjoyable book to read.
B00QGIG5LI|4|I liked the music, although I would have preferred a few more walzes.  But I have enjoyed playing it several times.
B000002UB3|5|This album is the most exciting by the fab-four. The starting is gripping (&quot;Come together&quot;). The ending is amazing (&quot;Her majesty&quot;, as short a song can be ... 32 seconds or so). Let me assure you (if you are not assured already) you will love what is in between these two great songs. I am mad about &quot;Octopus's garden&quot; and the medley is great.  This album also showcases the matured musical talents of the Beatles. The playing is much more polished than previous albums, like the guitar in &quot;Here comes the Sun&quot; and the otherwise average &quot;I want you&quot;. George Harrison gives his most successful Beatles song in this album, a wonderful song called - &quot;something&quot;. This album is fast and it's slow. It's fun-filled and It's emotional. What I can say this is the most exciting Beatles album, you can get for yourself. So buy it now.
B00DQC2FPM|2|I was disappointed.  It is very flimsy.  It also cost more than Ecto1.

B000002J27|5|&quot;A Trick Of The Tail&quot; benefits from the fact that the group had to prove themselves equal to ex-bandmate Peter Gabriel after his <BR>1975 departure.  Gabriel's presence had provided the group's<BR>lyrical edge, soulful vocals and delicate flute playing, as well as their reputation for theatrical rock through his stunning use of masks and costumes on stage.  In order to make up for this gap, the four remaining members put their all into &quot;Trick&quot;, which upon release became the band's biggest selling item to date.  On first listen, the album seems overwhelmingly magical; Collins sounds uncannily similar to Gabriel (this would lessen with each successive release), and his harmonies on &quot;Entangled&quot; are superior to anything done previously.  The album opens with the one-two punch of &quot;Dance On A Volcano&quot;, which opens up vast, deep vistas of sound onto which the band display some of the most focused and virtuosic playing in their career, then settles down into Hackett's brilliantly mesmerizing &quot;Entangled&quot;, a gentle acoustic number that builds in intensity through its deceptive lyric and Banks' regal keyboard work.  &quot;Squonk&quot;, which follows, foreshadows a bit what was to come on future albums, although it is still a keeper.  &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot;, which closes side one, takes one on a breathtaking journey through windswept desert sandscapes and cosmic synth/piano stylings which remains one of Tony Banks' finest moments on record.  <br />Side two is a bit iffier, as the opening &quot;Robbery, Assault And Battery&quot;, while energic, features a duff music-hall styled lyric that is only rescued during the instrumental break.  &quot;Ripples&quot; is a classic, featuring more of the ambrosiac sounds of Banks' synths and Hackett's backwards guitar against the delicate 12-string guitar work; its lacey perfection summarizes the achievements of the album.  The poppy title track follows, which although telling a charmingly sad tale, does not musically hold up to repeated listenings.  The closing &quot;Los Endos&quot;, however, is a sweeping fusion-inspired instrumental which reprises several of the other tracks on the album and rounds things out in divine fashion.  This album is extremely accessible--even commercial--<BR>prog-rock, although it does not lose its sense of authenticity.<BR>It is just solidly made, tasteful fare, although it misses Gabriel's inspiration in a few places and this tendency would increase with each successive effort.  Still, one of their best.
0783240503|4|Having not watched any production of the show, I was glad when I learned that video format of the show has been released.  I initially learned of the show when a cast recording featuring Jason Donovan was released some years ago.  With the video format, I was also interested in the performance of Donnie Osmond as Joseph.<br />However, when I watched the video, I realized that it was not a recorded live performance.  The production design has also been changed for cinematic effect.  While the production concept was good, it seemed like I was watching a long music video.  The video would have been better if a live performance was recorded so that the viewer would have a feeling of 'theater' while watching it (just like the video of 'Jekkyl &amp; Hyde', which unfortunately featured David Hasselhoff, but that's another story).  It would have been great if you know that the performers are really singing, not just lip-synching their lines.
B00LGT224G|5|I have been wanting this since I first used it on the computer, not having drawing capability is okay since it does not work on I-pad either.

1419701533|5|I recommend to friends to share this book. The pictures are so funny. Delivery time was correct. The price was a little bit high but, condition of book is like new one, so I like it. Especially, Adults who are tired and need clear mind should try it.
B00688628M|5|A great series - the cinematography is outstanding
B00IJJUIMY|5|What can one say? Another tour-de-force from one of America's greatest modern writers. You may think his genre is not of interest, but you would be mistaken. Michael Connelly is a great writer about the nature of human beings; their thoughts, emotions and lives. His plots are so intricately, authentically and painstakingly well-woven that I hesitate to call myself by the appellation &#34;writer,&#34; even though I am one. Michael Connelly is a treasure to all who love to read.
B00005QK3W|4|Paul has made a comeback after his disappointing 'Flaming Pie'. Not that I had any doubt he would. The sound is lean, and he adds <BR>some muscle to this record which he has not done for some time. Jazz fans might take some notice of this recording as well, since Abe Laboriel Jr.'s chops are given soem prominence; no Ringo Starr here. Also, the Hammond B3 organ is given a significant role. Very hip.  The track 'She's Given Up Talking' has a feel an an extended playout which has retro-seventies funk written all over it. 'Spinning on an Axis' also explores seventies retro, but it will not remind you of Paul's own seventies output. Some nice use of elecrixc piano on this one. 'Your Loving Flame' is a minor gem, an anthem, nicely handled. <br />'Driving Rain' has all of Paul's pop and rock sensibilities in full form, and his vocals are excellent. Recommended.

B0009P42S2|4|this was one of the most beautiful animated movies i have watched. everything from the entwining machinery to the fast paced action sequences left me in awe. the storyline was a bit dry during the first half of the movie with the exception of a chase scene involving a steam powered automobile and a train. you could just tell that the creators of this movie were so deeply involved with the way the movie looked that they somewhat sidestepped the editting process. same thing happened with the first final fantasy movie. overall though, this was still a gorgeous picture worth a look by any fan of anime.
B00CHSPB8Y|5|Challenging, yet fun.  I wish there were more suits to choose from.  The big boy suit from the movie would be fun.

B00F1BFRA6|5|Great! Watched all seasons.
B00H8C4HZ2|3|This is ok: thumbsnails of history so might provide some education but thumbnails only as too much history covered to do a decent treatment. Acting: really terrible actor selection for the presidents and although Whitaker and Winfrey do a decent job in their roles, nothing more than adequate.  Date movie? Perhaps if intellectual lady or dude. Spousal unit viewing?? Sure as not a lot of foul language or violence. Children or anyone under the age of 15? Nope. Would not hold their attention. So in the end, if nothing else to watch, rent it but otherwise forget it.
B000005JAX|5|First off, let me warn you, you'll be dissappointed unless you're a Die Hard DM fan. The synths are skeletal, only providing the most stripped down framework for a song. The instrumentation is minimalistic so that the vocals will stand out. Nevertheless, the album is incredible. Like everyone else has been saying, the album is intensely emotional. That's definitely it's most notable characteristic. Also, Martin's voice rings like it has never before on any DM album of the past. His voice is just so strikingly moving here. <br />Now for the bit that you haven't heard before... tracks 2-4 are very melancholy and dark, much like the true gems of Depeche, and are my favorites. Track 5, &quot;Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth&quot; has a lighter, fuller sound with acoustic guitar backing the vocals and has a very mezmerizing quality the way Martin layers his vocals.<br />While it's true Compulsion is the only DM-ish sounding song, it's really quite boring. It sounds really flat and is not the least bit engaging, emotionally. The lyrics are sung all at one tempo and Martin monotonously rushes over them kind of uneventfully. <br />Finally, Track 6, Motherless Child, is so beautiful. It's dark and desperate. The first minute of the song is comprised of a drawn out intro (using a string section, etc) that paints a beatutiful soundscape as the basis of the song. There is only a single stanza, 4 lines, to the song. Martin uses this track to demonstrate his vocal talent as he drifts across multiple octaves. It's stunning. <br />I love the lyrics of all the songs. All are as soulful and just as enigmatic as DM's best. A true gem for the open mind.

B0012Q94QW|2|Far too predictable and constantly dragged down by plot holes and epic clich&eacute;s, Roland Emmerich's latest special effects extravaganza still showcases enough silly fun for those who can easily suspend their disbelief and don't demand well-conceived characters. Basically, no one should like such a film, yet it's still hard not to enjoy the sight of a herd of stampeding mammoths causing death and destruction.<br /><br />The year is 10,000 B.C., and a remote mountain tribe of mammoth-hunters is attacked by a marauding group of slavers who capture Evolet (Camilla Belle), the promised wife to unwilling leader D'Leh (Steven Strait). Desperate to retrieve his beloved Eve, D'Leh embarks on a perilous mission across treacherous mountains, predator-infested jungles, and burning deserts, that will find him uniting several warrior tribes to overthrow the tyrannical leader of a lost civilization.<br /><br />It's as clear as white rain that 10,000 B.C. isn't striving for any manner of authenticity in its portrayal of ancient anything. At best mimicking an Apocalypto in Egypt and at worst an inferior retelling of One Million Years B.C., Emmerich's film attempts to shadow what could have been in \\"300: The Bedtime Story,\\" but sacrifices any true power and intensity with sappiness and stereotypes. The decision to have the protagonist's tribe speak English may seem logical to entice the average moviegoer, but a careful examination isn't required to find several contradictory and unnecessary narrations. In an attempt to feign authenticity, much of the dialogue feels contrived and pointless. Lines like \\"just try it\\" as a contemptuous retort just don't belong in a pre-history epic.<br /><br />Another area that betrays the film's setting is the casting. Faces that are far too pretty and teeth that are way too white scream Hollywood, though this film isn't exactly meant to be a history lesson. All of the primary cast do the best with the dialogue they're given and Camilla Belle certainly looks like a prize worth chasing after, but don't expect the energy or thrills of something like Apocalypto.<br /><br />10,000 B.C. thrives on its CGI effects, and while not all it portrays is flawless or very realistic (as realistic as giant dodos and wooly mammoths can be anyway), what it attempts is still satisfyingly grand. Stampeding furry elephants, velociraptor-esque dodos and a not-so-mean saber-toothed tiger round out the brunt of the prehistoric creatures and much of their resulting action sequences do entertain. The most impressive special effects, however, belong to the long shots of gargantuan pyramids being constructed by thousands of scurrying people. When these massive monuments inevitably come crashing down, that's pretty thrilling too. Quite a bit of creativity (though probably not much authenticity) went into the unique and varied costumes that adorn each tribe of warriors, as well as the enslaving tyrants who recall their majestic and garishly dressed counterparts in the earlier ancient tale, 300.<br /><br />If you were excited by the trailer for 10,000 B.C., you'll probably go see it regardless of how many ill words we can throw at it, and maybe you shouldn't let a lack of story, character development, and realism stop you from enjoying a little mindless, guilty-pleasure, action-adventure fun. Well, maybe it should.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsh chasing after, but don't expect the energy or thrills of something like Apocalypto.     10,000 B.C. thrives on its CGI effects, and while not all it portrays is flawless or very realistic (as realistic as giant dodos and wooly mammoths can be anyway), what it attempts is still satisfyingly grand.

B00ATDOVNK|4|I am enjoying this game so much!  The graphics are beautiful and the story keeps me guessing.  Love it! Will definitely consider buying more of similar games.
B0092G1O8A|5|a perfect follow-up to the novel in my classroom. We can't wait to see the second movie next in late November!
B003JTHXOK|5|One of the greatest all time books I have read! Love the writer Nicholas Sparks and would recommend this book to EVERYONE!
B000FC0V3E|1|I can honestly say that this is the first book I have ever really disliked, and I have been an avid reader of all types of books for decades. I honestly gave it a chance even though I wanted to stop reading it about 1/3 of the way through.  Having never ever not finished a book, I labored on. It was full of boring descriptions and antics and none of the characters had any substance.  When I did get to the end I asked myself, \\"What was the plot?\\"
B00E8KLWB4|5|You get energy really fast. Wish there were more like it. Woohoo need 20 words to rate it hahA. Everyone should play it. fun game
B007SGLZP8|5|After all these years and still great novels, the twist is very well done.  Grisham has the knack for keeping involved

B007IXWKUK|5|Loved the book!  Very exciting and well written.  As I was reading it, I could &#34;see&#34; what was happening as if I was there!
B005PK553C|5|I watched this series as quickly as possible, there was always an element of suspense. I don't really like horror movies but this was a great balance of creepy without being too scary for me. There were lots of jumpy moments and some rather gruesome subject matter but all in all it was a really great watch.
B003O86FMW|5|Took a while to get into, but amazing book! Stayed up late 3 nights to finish it :) can't wait to start on the next one, because I am entrapped with the stories.
B004LUHQ1G|5|I've been looking forward to this album for months, and now that its finally here it was well worth the wait!  This just goes to show that musicians rock harder with age!  These guys are in their early 40's yet they can write a tune that gives Aerosmith a run for their money!  Thank You FF!  This album will keep me occupied for some time!

B001IF252C|1|I read the reviews here but I thought \\"this won't happen to me\\" but, it did. I upgraded to a mac mini server to replace a dual G5 and was happy with the performance but could only get 1280x800 resolution. After reading up, I found that the Apple person didn't tell me I needed a $100+ cable to get the resolution I was used to, 2560x1600. I went all the way back to the store, bought the cable and immediately saw the 'pixel garbage' problem. I even tried using an external USB hub to power it and still saw the problem. What the problem looks like are quick flashes of a dotted line of pixels, looking something like this  ..... . .  ..  .... .. ..... ...  and it shows up around several places seemingly around the mouse cursor. It doesn't happen all the time but enough to irritate you and make you want to return the machine. Apple has got to be aware of the issue because after a very brief conversation with the store manager here in San Francisco (Stonestown) they took it back without a restocking fee. BTW, until Apple resolves this issue there isn't a monitor-less machine you can buy which will drive a 30-inch monitor to it's max resolution and, doesn't cost over twice as much as the most expensive mac mini. It's really a shame.<br /><br />Again, I urge you, don't buy this cable...you *WILL* run into the same problem, take it from all the reviews here and on other sites. I didn't listen and wasted a lot of time and effort.
B00D4E9BDQ|5|What a great find.. remind me (not style wise but uniqueness) of Deadmause Random Album Title.  You hear it this CD and you know folks are bringing in uniqueness and individuality to the dance genre
B0089K7DGW|5|The receiver wanted the series. He loves having it.  I am sure that it applies to the other seasons as well.
B00D3PYQT0|5|I was so happy I purchased the set of Downton Abbey.  It's a beautiful series.  I laughed, I cried.  I could sit and watch this over and over all day, every day..
B00FMQILBC|5|These look great on my granddaughters lilac colored walls.  She loves them.
B001UV4XIS|4|This movie was very excellent.  We were very empressed.  The ending was just wonderful.  We give it a thumbs up for sure.
B004I8WD6E|5|This case is a fantastic value - big thumbs up to Amazon for this one. Its virtues:  - The case material itself is a rubbery kind of plastic maybe 2mm thick on the sides, great for absorbing small impacts  - I'm a klutz, so I've dropped my phone a few times now from up to 3-4 feet onto hard floors, and the case has protected it with flying colors each time  - The case is transparent, allowing the iPhone's attractive form to show through  - The case itself wraps a bit around the front, so if you place or drop the phone face-down, it rests on the case and not the glass screen  - In addition to the case itself, it comes with a screen protector film, small cleaning cloth, and small plastic squeegee for applying the film to the front of the phone and ironing out bubbles  - It has an attractive concentric ribbed pattern on the back - the raised ribs are inside the case, leaving the outside backing smooth (good for applying decals, for example)  - The cutout on the bottom is wide/tall enough to accommodate all Apple + 3rd party dock plugs I've used  - It's cheap  The only downside I could come up with is the \\"Amazon Basics\\" logo at the bottom on the back, though it's small and unobtrusive. If that logo wasn't there, nobody would have known that you'd paid < $10 for a quality, attractive case.  That being said, I can't recommend this case highly enough. Great price for a great product.

0790734850|5|Film Noir - I am beginning to suspect that this term is alienating casual moviegoers who think this is an artsy-fartsy term for some type of (grit your teeth!) art film. This is the only way I can accept the lukewarm box office numbers for L.A.Confidential, easily one of the best pictures of the year. Well, folks, that four-letter French word just means \\"dark,\\" and, whatever its origins, film noir is a most American form of movie. Humphrey Bogart in \\"Maltese Falcon,\\" Robert Mitchum in \\"Night of the Hunter,\\" Orson Welles in \\"Touch of Evil,\\" Jack Nicholson in \\"Chinatown\\".. have I got any takers yet? The darkness is the menace, or evil that threatens to overtake our protagonists, who frequently have a darkness all their own to justify their plight. Coupled with many dark night scenes, such movies portray seamy lives, on the edge. The main character is usually a private detective or criminal, but the heavy drama works just as well for cops, and so it is in L.A. Confidential.<br />Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) is father figure to three officers: Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) loves the media attention from his technical adviser role on Dragnet, and his pot bust of Robert Mitchum. All his celebrity arrests are written up (and staged) by a sleazeball reporter played by Danny DeVito. Bud White (Russel Crowe, Virtuosity) is your basic thug with a badge. He only roughs up real criminals, so the captain appreciates his `adherence to violence as an adjunct to the job.' With 50 pounds less muscle, we have Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), a Dudley-Doright with wire-rimmed glasses. He's due for promotion to lieutenant, but Smith cautions him against his ambition to become a detective. \\"Are you willing to create evidence to convict a man you know is guilty? Will you give false testimony to put him away?\\" he asks. \\"If not, you haven't got what it takes for detective work, boy-o.\\" Early on, Exley breaks the code of silence and testifies against White's partner, throwing him off the force. These two who had nothing in common now have a grudge. Exley survives the snub of his peers by displaying a political savvy that exceeds that of his admiring captain.<br />When a botched holdup leaves an all-night diner stacked with bodies, things get interesting. One of the victims was White's disgraced partner, and another was a high-class hooker he had encountered. Exley becomes a hero when he finds the suspects, gets their confessions, and, after they escape, hunts them down and wins the shootout. Even though he's accepted again, Exley has doubts about the whole case, and so does White, for different reasons. Vincennes finds his own tie-in, and the improbable trio independently do some digging. They all find puzzling resistance, but they keep their resolve by re-examining their motives for joining the force in the first place. The truth that comes out lays bare the corrupt underbelly of LA, much as Chinatown did.<br />Although L.A. Confidential doesn't borrow from that script, the cinematography owes it something. Many brilliant sunwashed scenes contrast not only with the night, but also to the dark reality that awaits. Director Curtis Hanson keeps things moving right along, and just when it promises to get heavy, he throws in a small mistaken identity scene to give everybody a good chuckle. Kevin Spacey is as smarmy and watchable as ever, being interesting without really stealing any scenes. James Cromwell was ready to quit acting a couple of years back, but Babe and First Contact have him back on the short list, and he delivers again here. Kim Basinger has one of her best roles, as a hooker with dubious connections to the investigation. The always-underappreciated David Strathairn plays her boss, running a stable of celebrity lookalike escorts. The breakout stars, however, are Australians Guy Pearce and Russel Crowe. Our unfamiliarity with them makes it easier to get involved in their plight, in a way we couldn't with, say, Tom Cruise and Bruce Willis. Bothgive compelling performances that should stick in your memory.<br />Another thing I should mention about film noir -- no computer graphics, no big explosions. The producers fall back on that old dodge of good actors and a good script. No wonder we don't see more film noir.
B001KDQ4KQ|4|The Pact is a sobering look at how people truly do not realize how much their interpretation of happiness and expectations can muddle a child's life.  This is a harrowing tale of love and heartache that was a quick read o a difficult topic. A must read.

0920668372|5|My oldest son (36) gave me this book about 5yrs. ago for Mothers Day, He wrote inside it \\"This is my story for you\\" I started reading it in front of everyone and it was all I could do to hold back the tears. When I got home I did cry when I read it again and every time I pick it up to read again I cry. I have bought 4 in the last year or so to give to new Mothers. I love this book!

B00NWLIW0E|3|As soon as I got this game i fell in love with it so much that I played it for 3 hours straight but then there where no more levels. It was kinda sad. Theres only two and It would nice to have more levels
B002DOSBMK|2|I was disappointed in this book. I have read Salvatore before and enjoyed what I read but I was barely able to finish this one. The characters were not believable and I was unable to relate to any of them. If this is what Forgotten Realms is all about, I will not read any more under that heading. I fail to see how such a civilization (and I use the term loosely)could even survive much less thrive.
B007C7UZIG|5|Just haven't got any pc games that can be ported to this app and that is the only pitfall I see.
B001GQSY5U|3|OK. Let's face it. MOST people are downing The Clone Wars because it just doesn't live up to the rest of the Star Wars saga. In that respect, the public is 100% correct.    Now, let's take The Clone Wars for what it really is. It is merely a feature-length prelude to the kid-friendly animated TV series on Cartoon Network; nothing more, nothing less. Even George Lucas himself admitted in an interview that the Clone Wars feature film was pretty much \\"an afterthought\\" after he viewed the dailies from the actual TV show.    I, for one, felt that the animation was quite beautiful and pleasing to the eye as far as the backgrounds and layouts were concerned. Yes, the characters did appear to be too rigid and expressionless and everyone's hairstyles appeared to be molded from Play-Dough, but overall, the animation was quite nice; maybe not state-of-the-art, but still quite enjoyable.    Also, it is true that the plot was rather thin, but remember Lucas' target audience for this film and the TV series; kids and pre-teens. My five-year-old loved it and I enjoyed watching it with her. Compared to the actual movies, however, it does leave you kind of flat. Even Genndy Tartakovski's 2004 Clone Wars traditional animated series was vastly superior to this film, but you have to keep in mind the fact that the 2004 series was aimed at a more mature audience (teens and adults IMHO).    Will I watch the series on Cartoon Network? If I'm home and there's nothing else on or nothing else better to do, sure. If not, oh well, no big loss. I won't make it a point to tune in.    So, take this film for what it is; a kid-friendly chapter in the Star Wars prequel saga; just don't expect to experience that same thing that the films offered and you will enjoy it.

B000MXFPH8|5|I loved it. Since the voltage in the US is different from the voltage in Japan you will find some hotspots (I found 3 on mine) but after you know where it is, things get a lot better. Just make sure you brush a little bit of oil in the holes, sometimes it sticks a little bit.

B0001I561E|5|Disney Studios 31st full length animated feature film Aladdin is one of their best and my personal favorite from Disney's 3rd golden era. Filled with some of their greatest and memorable characters, the exotic setting lends to the beautiful animation. One of the funniest of Disney films with hilarious voice work by Robin William(Genie), Gilbert Gottfried(Iago)and Frank Welker(Abu), Aladdin also is one of the studio's most controversial with a couple of lines of dialogue being altered before and after the theatrical release. There were also some redrawn animation sequences supposedly done for the IMAX showings, but those showing never came to fruition and thus the changes weren't necessary. Unfortunately none of these alterations have been restored in this otherwise fantastic 2 disc DVD edition<br /><br />The film looks impressive on this DVD set, but I have to wonder why this film hasn't been re-released to Blu Ray? (At least in the U.S.) It's certainly one of their most popular titles and it hasn't seen a new release to home video for a number of years now. I can only hope that it is because Disney wants to make the Blu Ray as spectacular as this DVD was coming from VHS. The film looks and sounds fantastic with vivid colors and explosive sound. The color palette is deep and rich and it screams for a Blu Ray release, but if that doesn't happen, this version is more than sufficient. This is one of Disney's longest animated films at 90 minutes, but you would never know it for the pacing and story just seem to fly by. The extras are plentiful with lots of interesting goodies including one of the best making of documentaries I've seen on a Disney film. If you don't own the film, then the 2 disc DVD is the the way to go at least until a Blu Ray release comes along.
B00GYG4PRI|1|only gave one star because there is not an option for zero stars!

B00E9P959O|5|The material has always struck a cord in my soul and to have it now so clear and the way these songs were meant to be heard makes me deliriously happy. Now, when I hear the the opening chords of \\"Vapor Trails\\" and then Geddy's voice come in so clear, it brings tears to my eyes. I can hear instruments and vocals throughout that I couldn't distinguish in the original. I am listening with amplified  Sennheiser HD 650 headphones ripped with Apple Losseless format , but I suspect that even in the lower bit rates with decent ear buds you hear much improvement. Will have to try that later. :-)<br /><br />If you love this album you owe it to yourself to hear it as it was meant to be heard. Buy it. I promise you that you will not regret it.

B00AREIAI8|5|I think that this game is awesome to play with the kindle fire and I am not sure if I know what to say about it.<br /><br />.

1400032717|5|First off, I don't care if the character portrayed in this book is an inaccurate depiction of Aspergers Syndrome or Autism or whatever because the story amused and entertained me which is hard to do. I don't read very much because a lot of books bore me, but I found this book very interesting and easy to read. I read it in a week, which is phenomenal for me. The main character of the novel reminds me of Dr. Sheldon Cooper from the TV series The Big Bang Theory. If you enjoy the show The Big Bang Theory then you are likely to enjoy this book as well. I think it has some geek appeal. Don't pay attention to all of the Negative Nelly's who bashed this book.
B005LVR6ZA|5|What is reality??  Just when you think you know, you find yourself asking the question again.  In Ubik, not all is as it seems, and just when you think you have figured it out, you have that &#34;wtf?&#34; moment (more than once I may add).<br /><br />While some may find this novel as &#34;untidy or &#34;lazy&#34;' it does leave you in your thoughts.  What is reality?  Who is on our side?  Who are our adversaries? How can we be so sure?  Find the clues, they are there.
B006MW3UZW|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this series and am looking forward to season 3. I have just begun the third series and am trying to play catch up.
B005DI66N4|5|The book \\"The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom\\" is the amazing and tragic personal account of a Polish Officer named Slavomir Rawicz.  Slavomir's story begins when he was a young cavalry officer in the Polish army.<br />Slav, as he was called, grew up near Poland's border with Russia.  He was fluent in Russian and as a youth, made occasional mischievous trips across the border.  When the Germans invaded Russia, the Russians became very suspicious of any non-Russian citizen that lived in Russia or spoke the language, so they began to hunt them as potential traitors and spies.  The fact that Slav was fluent in Russian and that he was a Polish Officer made him an obvious target for the Soviet Secret Police (N.K.V.D.).<br />Slavomir was taken by the Secret Police for interrogation.  He was held for several months and during that time he was forced to endure long torture sessions, as well as starvation and sleep deprivation in an effort to get him to admit he was a spy.  Though he was sent to more than one interrogation facility, he was eventually convicted and sentenced to 25 years in a Russian labor camp in Eastern Siberia.  The trip there was long and arduous and was travelled by train and by foot.  Many of the prisoners travelling with him died from starvation, cruel treatment, and freezing temperatures.  It was in the Siberian camp, months later, that he and six of his fellow prisoners hatched an escape plan.<br />This is where the adventure begins.  Their journey to freedom started in the Siberian winter.  It continued on foot for nearly eighteen months over two thousand miles through some of the most grueling terrain and conditions on the planet.  They stole farm animals and killed wild game for food.  They made shelters for coverage from the elements.  They also relied on the kind and gentle people through their travels for whatever comfort and sustenance those people could provide. They transited through the farmlands and on the outskirts of the small towns of southern Russia where they travelled at night for their safety.  They travels took them through the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and China, where they pushed through intense heat, starvation, and dehydration.  Their journey took them over the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet and Nepal, where they again endured bitter cold and biting winds and overcame oxygen deprivation.  There they met the wonderfully helpful local people and finally entered India where they met the British army, who took them in and deloused and fed them.  Not all of them made it to the safety of British held India but all of them tried.<br />The story Rawicz tells, is both joyous and heartbreaking.  It is a story of man's triumphant spirit.  It is told in painstaking detail and insight by the man that endured it himself.
B005ZOBNOI|5|It's entirely possible I'm just being a sentimental sap, but I felt like there was a lot of stark honesty in this book, and a lot of things that resonated on a larger scale. And I guess that's what makes good writing, isn't it? In any event, I highlighted a lot of this book, which is really saying something. I loved it.
B007Y5IAV0|5|Love serj and system of a down this is one of the best albums yet I wish that he would put out a dvd now with all the music videos on it..

B00DPM90C4|3|Interesting read, scary scenario.
0767812417|5|A lot of movies based on very famous books have made me badly surprised until I saw this one. This is one of the best movies Ive ever seen! Superb actors and songs make this movie to an unforgettable one! A warning... When  youve seen it, Im sure youre going to sing this wonderful songs by  yourself for mounths!!
B00006LIRI|5|This is a great follow-up to the 1980-1990 CD from 1998. Chronichling the material that the band made during the 1990s, this absolutely is the 'Best Of' their 1990s era..well almost. <br />Several 'new' songs appear on this collection. The 'new' ones are the new song &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; which is awesome especially the William Orbit mix. The main thing that kind of throws me off a bit is the redoing of the singles from their 1997 album &quot;Pop&quot;. While the redone versions are very good, they don't hold a candle to their previous incarnations available on their parent album. <br />On the other hand, &quot;One&quot; absolutely deserved it's place on this CD as it's one of their most compelling songs of their entire career. A definate classic for the ages this song is. <br />This is quite a well done collection. The 2-CD edition is the version I recommend over this 1-CD version but even this version is worth getting as it offers some new material, unlike the previous collection.
B008IBPMZG|5|I love all the series but the second season helped explain the characters more.  The first season was hard to get into.
0062073281|1|I really wanted to get into this book and then in the end when it finally seemed like the good stuff was coming it ENDED what?! I agree her other books were far more better then this one I'm disappointed.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|My grandchildren will love playing it as much as I do. The graphics are outstanding and makes it so much fun to play.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I totally love the entire series.  I was  a little unhappy that Katniss and Peeta don't get together until the end of the book, however, I am glad that they do stay together.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B0042TV4IW|5|This is one of my favorite series of all time. I love the lessons it teaches about life, love, family, and community. The story lines are well-written and the acting is excellent. It draws you in and makes you feel like you are one of the family. I also love that you get a sense of how the majority of people lived during that time, rather than just the elite. I keep watching it over and over again and share it with friends and family whenever I get the chance.
B002Y0TGOU|5|beam me up please.
B003H4I4JU|5|Good read. Interesting follow up of Ender's Game
0810993139|5|That's one of the best book I've ever read! Proboly cause of the illustrations. There so great! I have read that book about 6 times now and i'm reading again. I most definatly reccomend this book for people ages 8-50 or just read it whenever! the whole family has a blast! <br />
B000002KHB|5|Forget about Led Zeppelin IV, Black Sabbath's Paranoid and all the others! This album is THE classic rock album of the 70's!( and of all time)  <br />Great songs from the first one to the last(( except maybe for \\"Never Before\\" that is just good) <br />If you're looking for real guitar playing this is a must have! one of the most influential guitar players of all time( just ask all the 80's shredding kiddos, like Yngwie Malmsteen, Van Halen and Randy Rhoads......)  at his best <br /> <br />ps: I really think the original version is better than the remastered one
B000C13Y2S|3|I bought this thinking I would be able to have it on my daily use keychain. However I'm certain the small plastic parts would not hold up to that. It still is a handy gadget which I leave in my electronics tool box to provide light on the small soldering projects and the like.
B000P6PVLC|1|Three individual scenarios play out in a very lifelike presentation all connected poorly in the script.<br />I wouldn't watch this a second time. Sexual content was totally unnecessary.
B004YW4L5K|4|I have been pondering this review for several days. The concept if this book is brilliant and I can see why it won the Hugo and Nebula awards. The idea that God's can become fleshed out by the worship of those who believe is not necessarily a new idea but to give them such life, such receipt and such needs is classic Neil Gaiman. I only started reading Mr Gaiman's work about a year ago and although I cannot call myself a Gaiman addict yet, I feel that is right around the corner.<br />The truth is, this is a good book and a wonderful story but I liked The Ocean At The End Of The Lane more. This may shock some folks but it is how I feel. There is a lot I liked about American Gods.....especially Shadow...and it is a good read. The Ocean At The End Of The Lane remains my favorite and with many more Neil Gaiman books to read, we'll see how that favorite holds up.
B00DJFIMW6|4|I really got this after seeing Despicable Me 2, I like the Minons and this game just hit the right spot really fun
B002MQYOFW|5|This book was recommended by a friend.  I read it in three sittings, and as soon as I finished, I started on the second book in the series.  I loved Katniss!  She was a tough girl who fought her way through every dismal situation, which is rare in young adult books today.  I liked the dynamic between Katniss and Peeta.  I also liked the development of the secondary characters.  The plot was inventive and unconventional.  This is a book I will read again.  WONDERFUL piece of writing!
B000LPS3B2|3|First off, let me say I believe I'm the victim of being too hyped up for this film. You know how someone says, \\"You want to hear a hilarious joke?\\" Then when you hear the joke it's not as funny as if they just would have told you the joke first.<br /><br />Anticipation ruins jokes just as it does horror films. I heard from numerous people this was one of the scariest films out of Asia and sadly I have to beg to differ. Although in all fairness, I guess by default, I would have to say it's the scariest out of Thailand (as no others come to mind). I'm just getting tired of seeing the same creepy-crawly Ringu girl in every film as of late.<br /><br />All ranting aside, I wont bother to create another plot synopsis as many other reviewers have already done that part. I'll be brief as I don't want the viewer to anticipate any scenes.<br /><br />Downsides-<br />Poor picture quality (reminiscent of a bad soap opera episode).<br />Not enough effective lighting (personally I like my horror films to have that generally dark feel to them).<br />Much like this one, too many films are capitalizing off of the creepy Ringu-girl.<br />Fairly predictable but definitely not 100% predictable.<br /><br />Upsides-<br />Decent plot (with exception to the *main \\"picture\\"* scene, that didn't make sense to me).<br />Some genuinely good creep-outs.<br />I really liked the general idea of the movie.<br />The closing scene was very good.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Shutter\\" was a decent movie. I never got bored or felt that the film was dragging on. It may have been better had I not expected so much. It's not that \\"Shutter\\" was a bad film, it just wasn't fantastic. If I were going to recommend an Asian horror, I'd still have to say the original [[ASIN:B000E0OE4O Pulse]] is my favorite.
B00A6CCF0K|5|As a sequel to a book I consider a classic, Doctor Sleep delivers wonderfully. The Shining holds a special place for me since it was the first King novel I ever read. The book scared hell out of me, but I could not put it down. Doctor Sleep was likewise compelling and it was fascinating and engrossing to see how Danny Torrance grew from child to man, dealing with the awesome abilities he has, learning to control them, and learning some tough lessons on the fragility and ultimate power of the human heart and soul. Highly recommended.
0307588378|4|What a book...you go from hating one character to loving it, to hating it again. I knew that something was off and that Nick was not as bad as they tried to portrayed him, but Amy...she was too much! I don't want to spoiled the book for those of you who are not sure if they want to read the book or not, but for those who want to, you are in for a ride!
B0028ER4PU|5|That's what happens to all the classy and historical places in life, so enjoy the few that are left before they disappear too!  It's a Doors album on 180 gram vinyl.  Guess there is a God after all.  I bet she's hot!

B00028HBL6|5|The passsion is the best movie about JESUS. It is far better than those syrpy bible movies insstead of ignoring the cruelty of the time it shows it in graphic detail. Jim cavezi is better in theJesus role than any one. the beatings are grusome  the crusifiicsion  is brutal with every detail shown. one inaccuracy is the damage to the templle the Bible says the curtain between the people and the highpreist was torn nothing else. the passion is the best if you havent seen it get it or rent it.
B008JEJPSC|5|this is a great movie to watch and have fun with the actors and watch when ever you want to watch
0385338082|5|What is not to love about this book?  This is the most fun and hilarious book I've read in a while.  This helped me survive a long flight overseas and couldn't put it down no matter how tired I was.<br /><br />The heroine, Emma Corrigan, is absolutely endearing. Her insecurities, which made her lie to her boyfriend about her real weight, or how she felt very small and rather worthless next to her very successful cousin makes her so \\"real\\" and just grabs you right from the start. As for the hero, well Jack was great too.  I loved how he stood up for Emma and tried to boost her confidence.  It was also great how he made Emma feel that she is a very desirable woman regardless of her insecurities both physically and professionally.<br /><br />Sure, some things might seem far-fetched, but they are also hysterical and made for some real light and fun read.  I was laughing so much the first time the main characters met when Emma, thinking that they were headed for a plane crash, started spilling all her secrets to the handsome stranger next to her, only to survive the flight and later found out that he was the owner of the firm she works at! You won't be disappointed and will surely love reading about Emma's escapades and how she finally gets her man in the end.
B00004SCX6|1|I bought this CD because I liked Oops I did it agian. I really was ripped-off. The girl can't sing. The only reason she has lasted that long is because of her body. I wasted my money. So take my advice and don't make my same mistake.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It is a wonderful and fun game.  I enjoy playing when on breaks and anytime I am bored.  Builds concentration
B00D7Z4GQY|4|The things that happen in our high school years often define or haunt us as adults. No matter how hard people try to control the outcomes of their daily lives, the intersection of the choices and experiences of others ultimately determine outcomes over which we have no control. This is a well crafted story of lives lived as a sequel to a defining event years in the past with a surprising twist in a detail upon which the events that followed turned.
B00FAX6XQC|5|I love this app so very much. It has AMAZING graphics and realistic settings. I HIGHLY recommend this app. I love that you can upgrade weapons, choose your hunt, I could go on forever. Overall it is an awesome, entertaining app and I reccomend it for ALL ages :)

0385738757|2|I. The Beginning: Did It Hook Me?<br /><br />I can't say whether the beginning of this book did or didn't hook me. If anything my love for the first book kept me reading this one. After I got over that, though, the book began to unravel. Their were random events that didn't make sense, all of a sudden Theresa was gone, and we were &#34;told&#34; EVERYTHING that was about to happen in the book. I wasn't sure at the time, but this ended up being the case.<br /><br />❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤<br /><br />II. The Characters: Could I Relate to Them?<br /><br />Not really. In the first book we had character studies of all the main characters, but in this book Thomas (somehow) doesn't know all the people he's with. Wasn't the Glade pretty small, how could he have not interacted with everyone? I was never really able to get over that, but I moved on.<br /><br />There is absolutely no character development in this book. We are given the same Thomas from book one, the same Minho (add in a leadership role), a slightly different Theresa, and a bunch of other people that didn't matter. Whereas I cared what happened to the Gladers in the first book, the characters I loved most (i.e. Alby and Chuck) were gone, so it really didn't matter to me.<br /><br />❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤<br /><br />III. The Plot: Was It Well Paced?<br /><br />I could say yes, but I don't know how accurate that would be. I will say I read this book in one sitting, but I ended up skimming the last 30 pages. This book starts off with a little bit of promise, and then event after event plays out. That's honestly what this book felt like, like the writer was &#34;ticking off&#34; events he wanted to cover before moving on.<br /><br />❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤<br /><br />IV. World Building: Did I &#34;Get&#34; It?<br /><br />Not at all. So the Scorch Trial is them crossing a 100 mile desert...that's it. Not to mention the tunnel they crawl through with the death balls and the evil lightning in the desert. All of that should have had any eerie feel, a sense of impending doom that made me eager to see what happened next; that didn't happen though.<br /><br />Where as book one gives vivid descriptions of the world around them, this book is more focused on the action (or lack thereof). I understand the desert was hot, but after a few pages there was no more mention of it. With all that walking you'd think they'd have blisters at the end of the night, be tired and sun weary, but we really aren't told.<br /><br />This book was seriously one big letdown.<br /><br />❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤<br /><br />V. The Ending: Did It Make Sense?<br /><br />I honestly don't know. While I did technically &#34;read&#34; this book, I skimmed the last 30 pages. After that, I read some dialogue and the message at the end. That's it. I did see something about &#34;things&#34; with extra arms and the desert opening up, but I honestly couldn't bring myself to care.<br /><br />❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤  ❤<br /><br />VI. Overall<br /><br />This book was the biggest letdown. I often found myself wondering if this book was from another series. It was 100% unlike the first book. I know the second books in series are not always better than the first, but this was ridiculous. We had a journey explained in accurate detail before it happened, no descriptions and random deaths of people we didn't even know.

B0071XO8RA|5|I must admit I was skeptical when I bought this book. Were all those great reviews posted because the book is cheap, and were the reviewers giving it a great quality/price ratio, or is it truly a great story ?<br />Well, I very quickly found out that it is indeed an excellent science fiction novel. The author has created rich and complex characters, and set them in a strange underground world that is so well described, you can almost feel it around you. The story keeps you guessing, and leaves you just enough clues so that you can make intelligent assumptions, but not too many that you can predict the next turn of events. Although the science part of the story is certainly entertaining, the real strength of this story is in the the social relationships between the people living in this strange world.<br />A great read, and best of all there's plenty of room for sequels, can't wait for them to come out !
B0085W6II8|2|This thing sounds like the darker side of Steve and the uh..side of Chris without punch. Translated...VERY compressed. And really are aliens just us from the future???

B001P06GX4|5|I am very pleased with this game it is super fun and easy enough yet challenging enough for everyone from my 5 yr old to the genius that I am (that's a joke).  After being disappointed by lame games such as Sorry Sliders, Trapdoor Checkers and Mousetrap, it is easy to be wary of lame games where it seems that the makers sat around drunk and made up the rules.  Even I Spy Eagle Eye was sort of a let down, it could've been SO much better if they just hadn't cheaped out on the number of cards included in the game.  Blokus is a sure fire win, it's sort of like Tetris and Dominoes combined, pretty cool.
B002OSXDAU|4|Ayn Rand was a truly deep thinker, lots of whom's ideas I share.  Her vision of the world, especially considering how long ago it was written, is on the money.  It's long but a good companion to 'Atlas Shrugged'.
0553582011|4|Series is getting boring.  Still better than the HBO show though.
B00BI5IXL4|5|Without a doubt the best musical film I've seen. Going for live performances (instead of lip syncing) was a gamble, but WOW, it paid off!<br />Make sure you have good speakers to truly appreciate this brilliant adaptation.
B005HXGE9G|1|This isn't even remaking or re-envisioning.  This is destroying.  Gabriel used to have talent, and he wrote great songs. It seems for the past 10 years, he's just looking for more and more ways to deconstruct and ruin music in the name of art.  Music shouldn't be a failed experiment, it should be a presentation of what you can do best.  This isn't groundbreaking, it's just heartbreaking.  As for this CD.  It sucks.  I was hoping for something that would fill my ears with joy.  I can't even make it through any of these songs before I jump to the next one to see how he destroyed his other classics.  In the words of my son, this CD is an epic fail.
B002MQYOFW|5|Hated the open as heck ending, but for sure makes you pick up the next one and dig in!  I didn't even realize this was coming out as a movie, and when I found out it made me pick up the pace LOL.  I must read before watching!! Can't wait to finish all three books!  The story draws you completely in on the first chapter.
B000NVT0RU|3|I had big expectations for this movie according to the reviews received.  It was not a very powerful drama and as a war movie it was light in the action, I consider it slow moving and very talky.  As stating a case for returning the retirement benefits for the North African soldiers that fought for France in World War II that were suspended after the Independence of Morocco and Algiers from France it makes a point.<br /><br />It did not shock me the mistreatment and contempt the French authorities provided the North African soldiers as they were considered second class citizens of the colonies (the first class citizens were the French living in the colonies calles Pied Noir) and not even French nationals.  The North African soldiers were fighting for their oppressors in reality.  It is ironic that while Americans, Canadians, Brits, Poles and scores of people from different nationalities and continents were fighting for the freedom of France against Nazi Germany at the same time France was keeping a sizable number of their military keeping tha French colonies in North Africa and Asia in line. In this situation of double moral standards using people considered inferior as cannon fodder I believe was only expected.  The North African volunteers or Indigenes were not fighting for freedom, equality or brotherhood and specially not for France, each had motivations other than love of country as we can attest in the movie most went to Europe for plunder and payment, as mercenary soldiers.  It is well known fact that during the Italian campaign around Monte Cassino that by the way was won using French colonial troopers lead by General Juin where Brit, New Zealander, American, Pole and Indian troops had already failed the most hated soldiers by the Italian populace were the North African Goums because of their wide spread looting and raping.  Knowing these facts I am not very well inclined to feel weepy for these men.<br /><br />About the movie, the battle in Italy is well choreographed could have been more informative if we knew what battle we are talking about, is it the taking of the hills sorrounding the german positions at Monte Cassino ?  It is only referred as Italy 1944.  We see few germans a couple of machine gun nests and a mortar pit composing the obstacles the Indigenes have to surmount for their first victory, but was it an important victory, did it accomplish something in the full scope of the Italian campaign?  Maybe if we knew this was a mile stone or something important was accomplished we would be more inclined to support the claims of the North Africans for their justs pensions and benefits from the French Goverment.<br /><br />The battle in France is too talky, we are mostly presented with the injustices of white non coms being promoted ahead of the Ber Bers but we don't know if the Indigenes were really deserving of faster promotion, the French Sargeant Martinez and the Corporal are very good leaders of men as  they are presented and certainly demonstrated better judgement and authority than the Indigene coprporal so this case is not well presented.  We see an unconvincing romance between an Indigene soldier and a French lady and somehow we are led to believe that a one night stand is so significant in the life of the soldier called Mahmmoud that he is willing to desert his post and face the possibility of imprisonment and maybe death just to return to Marseilles and see her, I did not see enough chemistry or even emphaty between these characters to believe this.  As for the authorities trying to keep the Senegalese and North African soldiers away from the population by denying them home leave or even the privilege of getting uncensored letters was probably to be expected as I already said these were considered only cannon fodder and a little better than lootists and thiefs.  Yes, they were fighting for France but still were treated as dangerous foreigners.  But we have to consider the position of the French authorities that dreamed with returning France to its former glory retining its prestige and of course its colonies it was not in their best interest to provide equality for their colonial nationals.  Remember that many of these authorities have openly cooperated with the nazis during the occupation and the Vichy free government.<br /><br />The last battle in Alsace was the main point and we can see at last courage and determination in the North African soldiers as they defend a position against a german attack with greater numbers and equipment than thay had even when they have their French officers killed and rendered unfit to fight.  This is a nice small action a la Saving Private Ryan and probably saves the film from being boring and tedious.<br /><br />I believe that France should repay its veterans no matter the ancestry for their contributions during the war and that the pensions should be returned, maybe this is the whole point of the movie but could have been presented in a more convincing fashion.h returning France to its former glory retining its prestige and of course its colonies it was not in their best interest to provide equality for their colonial nationals.

B008BMWKXO|5|Extremely well written, directed and acted. I'm not one for revisiting films I've already seen, but this one was worth another viewing.
B000ICZCZS|5|This is why I still like Hugh Grant, and how I started reading Nicholas Hornby. It doesn't pretend that any of the characters are easy, even the one who is completely determined to keep his life uncomplicated. And I've known a lot of mum's like Marcus' and that character is all at once frustrating and stupid, but well-meaning and overwhelmed. Great movie.
B009U9S6FI|5|Framkl's words carry wisdom and healing for me.  This work has some technical references that I am unfamiliar with but I am a layman; not a psychologist or even a psychology student.  Still, it was a great read and well worth my time.  If you are looking for light reading or simplistic antidotes this is not it.
B008OOYALE|5|this is a great game and I recommend it to anyone. the dragons are really neat and it doesn't take forever to create your own dragon park.
B00IXF8PLU|5|I loved the movie even though it was sad but that is to be expected since the story was about World War II. The young actors were so good in their rolls. Instead of popping pop corn bring a box of KIleenex.
B009O2XY12|5|my son loves it. constantly playing this and other games. would buy games like this. makes road trips easier by keeping them doing something
B00EOO1RHS|4|very satisfied with the Anker scratch protector installed easily

B006ZAZ31U|5|Great new take on the navy seal genre. This book will make you reevaluate your life. It brought me to tears. Great read!
B0001I562I|5|I loved this film when I was a kid. And looking back on it, I can clearly see why. The concept of an ordinary kid being a navigator of a spaceship really became something unusual back then. And it's still a benchmark in children's sci-fi as of today. The scientific analysis of the connection between the kid and the spaceship didn't make sense to me back then, but now it's clear, and it's sort of creepy if you think about it. Paul Reubens as Max is a treat, and the supporting cast (especially Sarah Jessica Parker as McAdams) are attention-grabbing. The music is now corny compared to back then, but it's still quite catchy. All in all, it's an entertaining family film . . . that should get a better treatment on DVD!
B0061PEAUY|3|I love the program Bones and expected that the book would be an extension of it. Not true. Just an okay book. Too Bad. I will stick with the show.
B000QRIGLC|5|Even knowing the ending, the story was action packed and you would think that every turn was going to be his last.
B00003CXE7|3|Gladiator was the first in a series of recent successful Russell Crowe movies, and I think he started on not so bad a foot.  The plot is centered on a general (Russell Crowe) who is loved by all, until the emperor's crazed son gets wind that Crowe is supposed to takeover instead of himself.  As all jealous based plots go, Crowe is sent away and stripped of his old life.  This is much like Dante in Monte Cristo, except for the fact that Crowe becomes a gladiator instead and has to find himself and \\"old Rome\\" through the games instead of a prison cell.  It is an okay movie overall, but really the only things that made this movie interesting to me were the gladiatorial games themselves.  I feel that the dialogue and basic plot overall is lacking, but I understand that the basic plot highlights the action, and therefore not meant to stand up to much criticism in the first place.  Historically it is off too, but not everyone cares about that kind of thing these days, but if you do be warned.  I would say this movie is worth a rental, and maybe on a personal level you will find it more exciting than me, but I would not just go off and buy it.
B00L9B7IKE|3|It was a good read but a little predictable. Its fast and easy fun read :)
B00A6CCF0K|5|If you ever read The Shining then this is a must read. Great continuation of the story. Sometimes you wonder about characters from books and this really gave you a look into the character's life.
B0035QUXWQ|5|I have watched this movie about a dozen times and it is always good. it's a classic and really never gets old. Best thing about it was being able to stream it free from Amazon Prime Videos. If you're not a Prime customer, you should be, it's a great service.
B000L53D4O|4|Great product for our grandson.
0385523904|5|As Barbara Demick says in her epilogue, North Korea is something of a mystery. How has it avoided the collapse that experts have been predicting for 15 or more years? How has it been so successful at keeping citizens ignorant of the outside world and the outside world ignorant of its machinations? And, because of these successes at insulation, is it even possible to understand what life is like in North Korea?    Fortunately, Nohing to Envy gives us a \\"yes\\" answer to this last question; here is a book where we hear the stories of six North Korean defectors. In interweaving chapters, Demick reconstructs these tales of struggle with the skill of a novelist (and anyone not told that this is a work of journalism may be forgiven for thinking it a dystopian novel a la [[ASIN:0451524934 1984 (Signet Classics)]] or [[ASIN:081297462X We (Modern Library Classics)]]).     Dr. Kim is a medical doctor, devoted to the Workers party; Mrs. Song is a wife forced to find any way she can to feed her family, including daughter Oak-Hee in increasingly dismal times; Kim Hyuck is a boy whose father gave him to a state orphanage rather than have a son he couldn't support; Jun-Sang and Mi-Ran are secretly boyfriend and girlfriend, each with private reservations about, and struggles with, North Korea that remain private for fear of governmental repurcussions. Through these tales, we are able to glimpse life in a nation gone horribly wrong, where selling anything privately or insulting the Workers Psrty can land you years of time in prison or a labor camp, where emaciated children sing songs extolling North Korea, and one's station in life is dictated by how loyal one's family has been to \\"the Party.\\" The stories are wonderfully told and, at times, I found myself putting the book down out of disbelief, outrage, and thankfulness for my own circumstances. I don't think anyone could read these stories and not feel very strongly.     Of course, Demick is also telling stories of defectors - by definition, stories about the strength of human spirit and tenacity. Nothing to Envy not only tells of economic collapse, but people's initiative in bringing about (illegal) markets to buy and sell goods. She not only tells of spirits being broken, but spirits persevering. And just as readers will certainly feel heartbreaks in these pages, so will they also feel joy in reading about some really brave people who broke the rules and thought for themeslves.     I cannot reccomend this book strongly enough! Readers of fiction (and biography) will get lost in the stories; readers of foreign affairs and political science will relish the descriptions of life under a most secret regime. Nothing to Envy is as captivating as a human story as it is informative as a political description.
B003JQLHY0|5|Liked a lot this watch, just received it so haven't had the time for checking its accuracy. Well built, the watch band its a little stiff but maybe with use it will get softer. Looks just as the picture.  The only problem is that in the description it says it has a 42 mm case and it´s more of a 38, here´s a picture comparing it to a 40 mm casio.
B00UA86F1A|4|seen it years ago and brought it again in blue ray, still very enjoyable
B00018TI5E|5|I love this album, it is totally awesome. Being a fan of John's work with the Chili Peppers, I expected this album to be a funky rock album... boy, was i surprised. <br />From beginning to end this album has a relaxing but mind boggling tone which keeps you attracted to each and every chord John plays. This was the first of John's solo albums i bought, second was To Record Water For Ten Days. That too was great. Now i have all his solo albums.<br />If you're a fan of this album strongly recommend John's other solo albums and also the Brown Bunny Soundtrack which has 5 of John's songs.
B000005S31|4|An album that has been overviewed by many and didn't even receive a remastered edition on CD in the US, ''Coney Island Baby'' is doubtless one of the most pleasant Reed albums for fans or even casual listeners, in pair with some of his hyped releases, even if it's not groundbreaking and probably can't be put among his all-times' top5 records. The collection is full of sweet love songs, devotional ballads in which Reed celebrates the natural joy he was experiencing at that time, plus some unavoidable songs about drugs and the results are touching. The opener, ''Crazy Feeling'', is a simple, highly enjoyable composition that makes everybody smile and want to dance when no one's watching. The title track is one of Reed's classics, with top lyrics, cool spoken-sung verses and an exuberant second half where Reed celebrates the glory of love. ''Charley's Girl'', the smoothy ''Kicks'' and the nice but unnecessary re-recording of VU's classic ''She's My Best friend'' are equally enjoyable, and the album as a whole is a very nice, sweet experience. You won't want to skip any track.
B009XIXVU6|4|An extremely well written novel (as were Hosseini's previous books.)  Hosseini takes us inside of the difficult lives of families in the middle east while exploring the timeless identity questions of nature vs nurture and the bonds that bind those of blood vs those who raise a child. Although this isn't a 'happy' book, its rich language and detail make up for the morose characteristics of the story.
B008K6DU4Y|1|It would only play video for 30 sec to 1 min then it would exit the video. I didn't have any problems like that with any other player for kindle.
1600242405|3|I'm a huge Stones fan, and Keith's insights were fascinating, but I was disappointed at the limited role that Johnny Depp played in the audio CD. Only the first quarter of the book is read by him; at that point it shifts in grating fashion to another reader.  I just plopped in disc 17, and Depp is back for the closing. The book is still a must for any Stones fan, but just know what's coming.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|The author says that he is not adding any new material, and that what he presents has all been said before by other authors. However, his presentation is so fluid and interesting that it is worth the read. This book provides perspective to the historic times in which Jesus lived in a way that no other book on the subject has achieved so far.
B009T9P7OC|1|I downloaded the player as it was offered free by amazon. The player had a lot of lag and was worst on my tipo dual. I prefer real player its the best I have seen until now. Even the free version rocks and can play videos too.<br /><br />People looking for a player which is convenient and good to commute, do not go for jetaudio.
B00DR0PDNE|4|We're still learning our way around this device, but after some initial needed changes to our wireless router it works fine. The picture quality is very good. When I bought it I thought it simply transferred whatever was on the screen of the device (cell phone/tablet) onto the TV screen, but I'm pretty sure you actually have to download apps that will work with the device. Still, it's cheap and much easier than having to hook my tablet into the TV using a HDMI cable.

B003102JDM|1|If I could , I would give this movie no stars.   It is like watching the Book of Job, but without the happy ending.  This movie was hard to endure because it was so boring, but I did because I thought it would have a redeeming happy ending. It does not.   I cannot believe the Coen Brothers could have made this, given their previous films.  Maybe a Jewish person would like it as it had so much Jewish customs and language in it.  It was unrealistic, as far as the problems in the movie were concerned, none of which were resolved.  A total waste of time.
0553582453|5|Love hobbs writing you just get to latch onto Fitz so much its amazing emotional connection.  Must read!
B00110K62U|5|Just wonderful to watch.  Everyone in the cast is just fabulous. Its back on Broadway and I am going to see it.  Can't wait.
B0009KA7BS|3|Let me say this up-front: I'm a huge fan of the \\"Hellblazer\\" comic book, especially the long run by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon. So I was more than a little nervous about this movie. But at the same time, I also like films like this, even when they're not connected to any existing franchise.<br /><br />\\"Constantine\\" feels like it both took too little from the comic books and not enough, which is a neat trick. There's likely a heck of a good movie on the cutting room floor or, more likely, in previous versions of the scripts that were sliced and spliced together to make the theatrical version of the film.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays LA detective John Constantine or, as he says it, \\"John Constantine, a-hole.\\" That's a cute line, but it points to one of the major problems with the film: It's Schwarzeneggerized. Dialogue in the movie, for the most part, consists of clever catch phrases (and we know \\"John Constantine, a-hole\\" is a catch phrase because a riff is done on it by another character within the first minute of Reeves saying it in the movie). Is he an a-hole? Hard to tell: In the comics, he certainly is -- John Constantine in \\"Hellblazer\\" will sacrifice small children to save a city, or sell someone else's soul for a marginally improved chance of defeating an enemy. In the film, Reeves' Constantine is mostly just moody, but we never heard him say \\"I'm Neo, a-hole\\" or \\"I'm either Bill or Ted, a-hole\\" in previous movies, despite his Constantine not being dramatically different from any of his other roles. But it's a cute line, so we're stuck with it.<br /><br />In the comics, these clever bits that Constantine says are spaced out over several issues and we see a lot more of his street level grungy street magic. He's not a cool guy, he's a failed human being who happens to pull a rabbit out of his hat and save the day, once in a while, but at great cost to everyone around him. In the movie, we get all the cool bits and none of the context. This is Neo in wool instead of leather and using magic instead of virtual reality.<br /><br />Likewise, the story, involving the Devil's son, angels and demons involved in a cold war on Earth and twin psychics, is very authentically \\"Hellblazer\\" -- specifically, it hits a lot of the moments in the Ennis/Dillon run -- but where it should explain, it skims and where it should move quickly, it broods on arty sequences. As a result, the actual plot of the movie comes suddenly at the end, and it feels as though most of what came before was unneeded, and it probably was.<br /><br />Having said that, the film looks like a million bucks, whether it's cinematography, special effects or costuming. You can certainly see where they spent the money they saved on having a solid script doctor come in and clean things up afterwards.<br /><br />Those interested in the subject matter -- a war between Heaven and Hell in a modern urban landscape -- would be better advised to pick up the Ennis/Dillon \\"Hellblazer\\" paperbacks (all of which are available here at Amazon) instead. \\"Hellblazer\\" fans would be advised to rent this, at most.<br /><br />Someone, someday, will make a great gritty supernatural thriller set on the mean streets of London. \\"Constantine\\" isn't it, and isn't even a particularly satisfying appetizer for that film.ol instead of leather and using magic instead of virtual reality. <br /> <br />Likewise, the story, involving the Devil's son, angels and demons involved in a cold war on Earth and twin psychics, is very authentically \\"Hellblazer\\" -- specifically, it hits a lot of the moments in the Ennis/Dillon run -- but where it should explain, it skims and where it should move quickly, it broods on arty sequences.

B0012PDVUS|4|A classic. Worth watching again after so many years.
B00HY7VU60|4|Held very close to the books. I love Philippa Gregory's novels.
B000002NJS|5|I know, many here say they love Madona and have been fans forever. I however, think of her as not just a singer, performer, artist, but further, I think this woman is able to see inside of people and herself, and is able  to quantify with words and poetic frases what she finds in our and her  soul. To help us understand her vision, she delivers her songs dressed in  music that takes us to a state of mind where her words make sense and where  our minds are able to visualize her pain or hapiness. I think that Madonna  demonstrated this ability in Bedtime Stories, even though the CD went by  without much fanfair. Here she proved that it was not a lucky strike or a  one time wonder, rather she is able to grow and learn from her life  experiences. This CD, like Bedtime Stories are my favorites from Madonna.  She really opens her heart and soul, like in Power of Goodbye, Drowned  Worlds, Substitute for Love and Nothing really Matters. These songs take me  on a trip everytime. If you just hear (not listen) to the CD, you'll  probably find it boring and a experiment in strange music. Once you really  get to listen to the music and the words and her angelical delivery, you'll  be hooked like most of us. By the way, the CD is permanently placed in my  car. I can't get tired of it. I think Madonna will never dissapoint me. She  is superb to say the least.

B0055S348W|4|Prior to installing PrinterShare, getting acceptable prints from my Android Devices involved transferring the material to a computer, then printing from there. Now I print directly to one of my printers with excellent results. I give it four stars mainly because it does not have drivers for some late model laser printers. However, to their credit, according to their listing, most of the popular printers are usable.

B0000CDUYP|5|My wife has been looking for this video for months.  Not having any luck in various stores, we decided to go on line.  I am not very good with computers, but we should have gone on line months ago.  Thanks for making the purchase so easy.  Our grandchildren will enjoy watching it.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|I love this book and I hope there will be a lot more.
B005PK1G76|5|Excellent for the price - bought one of these to add to our umbrella stroller for a recent vacation.  Worked great for cups, keys, etc.

B009NG1Q96|5|I enjoyed this book. I know it was intended for teens but it was a good read.
B007TBZ63Y|5|I was sad when the Percy Jackson books ended.  I absolutely LOVED them.  I totally love that this series is a continuation of the Percy Jackson books at a different camp with new characters.<br /><br />Such a great idea plus I am learning a bit about Roman and Greek History  (I have actually got a few jeapordy questions right from these books)<br /><br />Terrible cliff hanger at the end (I dont' want to ruin the ending for anyone so I won't mention what happened).  I read it on my Kindle and thought I had alot more to read and then I realized the book just ended and now I have to wait almost a year for the next book.
B00HDMMISA|5|Very entertaining read. I couldn't put it down. Loved the characters and settings. And the surprises were mouth dropping. Will read more of her books.
B007IXWL2C|5|When I first started reading this series I didn't know what it was about & when I got to chapter 8 I was like holy hell. I love the love story & the playfulness of the characters. When I got to the end I was sad that it was over. This series left me wishing it wasn't over & wanting more.
B00EFWU91E|4|Overall, it's a great ending to this series.  It can be a little tedious at times, but the ending is my favorite of any book.  I think this is Clare's strongest writing as well.
B003ZSJ212|1|More stupid changes, and no theatrical version : Lucas is going insane with the original trilogy.   He is ignoring fans requests, providing only his untalented vision.  The more you link the original trilogy to the disastrous prequels, the more you frustrate your fans.
B00722ZHG6|5|A very beautiful and loving voice, very passionate and abousulty wonderful to listen to. She is so passionate.
B007EDYN36|3|When I first heard of a Peter Criss bio way back in the late 80's I was quite excited to read Peters story.  Some 20 odd years later when the thing finally came out, I bought my Kindle copy the first day.  What I got was Peter Criss' rant at anyone and everyone he ever came into contact with in his life.  For how much Ace Frehley didn't complain or go into details about things that left him scarred in his bio, Peter MORE than makes up for it in his.  So much so in fact, that to me, the story begins to lose credibility by the end.  Peter comes off more as a paranoind schyz, which is really too bad.  He mentioned that he had actual writers ghost writing for him on that 80's version but he didn't like the drafts because, \\" it didn't sound like me\\". That's why people use ghost writers, Pete. So you come off as less of a dick.  Damn, now i've done him over too!  Sorry, Pete.
B005DOL0R0|5|Nice fit and good padding! I would recommend this to all to carry alone or in your bag, Works great!
B008XX6J4C|4|Up-dated musical renditions; very pleasant for cocktail parties!
1438074085|5|Nice books and CDs but too lengthy and need some extra time ,  but excellent you will sure spike your bands easily. For General Training modules should be more or equal to Academic modules, over all good. I will update Bands if I spike more than last exams I attended.
B0098VXE50|4|Starts slow, but builds.  Overall and OK movie, could have used a better link between Snow White and the Dwarfs.
B009LDD54K|5|Great show
B00ACP3OOM|2|Despite trying to re-position it and use/not use ear plugs, I thought the sound was very muffled.  I like the design quality and concept but had to return it.
B00FAXJHCY|5|One of the best books that I have read in ages. A detailed and riveting plot, excellent science and great emotion. Loved it! Brilliant read! 5 stars!!
B0084I9QIW|5|Love it! This is one of the quintessential DVD's on Michael to have in your library. You won't be disappointed if you revel in watching a genius perform his magic.
B00BMT9C84|4|was funny, and hit  the spot
B009UX2YAC|5|I love playing this game
B008KL2ITW|3|Now don't get me wrong, I love, and I mean LOVE, good-girl-meets-bad-boy stories. I do. And when I read the description for the book, I thought: yes, please. And for the most part it was what I had hoped for. It was an addictive and enthralling read. It starts out so promisingly. There was so much potential for this to be more than the average angsty romance. The complexities of Abby and Travis' relationship make for excellent reading and I thought they developed well as characters. Until the bit in Vegas. And that's when I started to get a bit miffed.<br />Because that's when reality plain flew out the window. That kinda stuff doesn't happen in real life. And it annoyed me, having to read it. It wasn't necessary to the story. In any way.<br />My biggest problem was Travis himself. Now I have a bad boy of my own, of sorts. But if any guy displayed the kind of behaviour Travis shows Abby, whether friends or more than that, I'd be rid of him in a minute. That kind of behaviour does not make a hero. I was honestly disturbed and alarmed when reading some of the scenes in this book. It is such a negative, emotionally draining thing to deal with that kind of dysfunctional toxic relationship. The violence and insecurity that are so much a part of Travis was frankly upsetting for me to read. I could never see myself in a happy ever after with someone like that, and for the most part, I don't believe that many women could.<br />So while I thought the book starts well and has the potential to be great, there are many problems with it. That said, it was addictive enough that I read it in two sittings. I would recommend it as a good book but I don't think anyone should take any lessons away from it.<br /><br />Also, I HATED the ending. For obvious reasons.
B000NQRE9Q|5|I was alway's a big fan, and now in Blu-ray. You get to see dust falling from place to place, stuff I couldn't see in the vhs or dvd version. Elsa if more beautyfull than ever. You get to see some détails, like rocks in the Raider's first temple, it's kinda painted behind Indy, Just to tell how much détails there is in it.<br />I can't wait for Indy 5
B00G4I1CLS|5|This was an extremely eye opening film! Both the quality of the film making and the overall narrative were so good. I was blown away at how little I knew about the treatment of orcas in captivity. Highly recommend.
B00BAXFDLM|3|Without spoiling on plot too much here there are some nice concepts in this book that, unfortunately, only seem to -approach- badassery.<br /><br />There is this whole dismantling of gender identification which is, although at first really off putting, ultimately a fascinating sort of experiment in forcing the reader to perceive the characters in a way they haven't before. I couldn't stop self reflecting on my difficulty getting past this; that made for an interesting reading experience for me.<br /><br />Then there is the whole concept of Ancillaries and the main character recounting events from multiple POVs at once. Very cool.<br /><br />And yet I never felt enveloped by any of it due to strangely bland and often cryptic internal monologues by the main character. A character who walks an inexplicably fine line between behaving like a machine intelligence and an emotionally charged and vengeful human: a concept in machine evolution that no effort was made to explain.<br /><br />Add to this a truly interesting plot flawed by a climax in which nothing much happens (no real badassery, just the potential for it?) and I feel a bit spritzed on after this one... when every indication of the first 40% or so felt like it was going to be a tidal wave.<br /><br />I understand why it has received the acclaim and recognition it did, I think this is her first book too. But it was a bit lightweight for me. Not much interested in reading the next one. Gonna go see if there's any more Alastair Reynolds I've missed :-)
B000007UTN|5|OK Computer, Radiohead's third album, was released in 1997 and went on to earn immediate critical acclaim. Sandwiched between The Bends, the most straightforward rock album of Radiohead's career thus far, and Kid A, their first truly experimental and electronic album, OK Computer sounds like a fantastic combination of the two. What you have here is a slower, moody, dark album that can be described only as probably the most accurate translation of what the current Western society might sound like on an album. The ironic sluggishness that comes with technological advances that are designed to make the world more productive, the fear, and the overall craze of things going out of control are all portrayed beautifully in just under an hour on OK Computer. It truly has to be heard to be understood.<br /><br />Now on to the pressing of the album itself. I purchased OK Computer on vinyl, which came in a beautiful gatefold double LP. The records are pressed on 180g vinyl and are of audiophile quality, and they are housed in gorgeous, abstract sleeves whose artwork only add to the atmosphere and theme of the album. I have been collecting vinyl for a few years now, and have been searching for this pivotal album for many months, only recently finding it in a record store. As for the sound of the vinyl itself, I'm no hardcore vinyl audiophile and my ears are not tuned to automatically hear what is a good pressing and what is not, but this album sounds absolutely stunning if you have a higher quality turntable and nice speakers. It truly has a whole different definition of sound on vinyl and sounds much more natural and warm.<br /><br />Go buy this. You will not regret it. Prepare to be amazed.
0307454541|5|I picked up the first book while traveling to Hawaii and when I returned I got the second and the minute I finised it I had to buy the third (still  in hardback). Although a little violent, I really loved the protagonist. What a shame this author's life has been cut short. This trilogy was a delightful diversion that I could not put down.
B000002UQJ|4|Off The Ground was the first studio project of Paul's following his extensive 89-90 world tour. Luckily, he still had some leftover songs he cowrote with Elvis Costello to place on this album. The collaborations are the strongest songs in this collection, using almost all of the musicians on the previous album. This is definitely Paul's preachiest album, bringing up topics such as his disdain for testing on laboratory animals, and concerns for the ecology. Hardcore fans didn't appreciate those songs at all, and neither did the radio. &quot;Hope of Deliverance&quot; was the only one of many singles released off the album that received a lot of airplay. If you are lucky enough to find one, look for Off the Ground- The Complete Works (2 CDs), which is the UK version of this album. It contains all of the b-sides to the singles--material that should have been used in place of weaker songs such as &quot;Golden Earth Girl.&quot; Other fine moments showing Paul at 50 can still rock are songs such as &quot;Get Out of My Way&quot; and &quot;Off the Ground,&quot; a very underrated song. If you liked Press to Play and Flowers in the Dirt, get this album-- you will not be disappointed.
0812973992|5|Absolutely loved this book.  McCann's writing style greatly improved from Zoli. A collection of stories that captivate the reader and inter-relate with meaning and depth.  Couldn't put it down.  Regretted to see it end.
B0018S6YOE|1|So they are charging $10 after I already bought the original for $14 which contains 3 songs less.   I'm not interested in all the video fluff so basically buying this would mean paying $3.33 per extra song - No thanks.  A really helpful review would be to tell us where someone can trade the original CD in for this one and get the $4 + tax back????  Market scams like this doesn't make me very sympathetic to the industry cry of piracy.
B000XUBFE2|5|A completely original novel, and a great read for anyone reading or learning about the Holocaust.  Also, you can just read it for fun.
B000YHG72E|5|Same day delivery - fantastic!!
B000MG1ZG0|3|I am a music lover and performer and I collect CDs and thought it would be cool to have Morrison hotel with 8 new tracks.  Little did I know it only had 3. One track I have already.  I have an early copy of Morrison hotel CD with out the extra tracks, as well as this one.  It's interesting to listen to all of the new stuff, on this CD, but it's not the original many of us grew up with.  I will give that the music sounds fuller on my surround sound stereo.  But the vocal on the first song (road house) has a horrible echo and it is very odd.  I thought it was my stereo, so I turned off the surround sound on it, and the vocal was still over affected and sounded horrible.  The rest of the CD sounds really good but as for growing up on this stuff it kind of ruins it.  The remastering on this copy gives it a cool spin on this old gem, but leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  In short; Road House, Land Ho have over affected and corny vocals.  Indian summer and queen of the highway sound awesome almost better. Then there are the extra tracks, these are out takes and mess-ups.  These are cool to hear how they recorded road house, but almost too much road house. The others sound really cool, they add to the value.   I'll keep this one for the nostalgia.  The booklet has awesome facts witch adds to the value, and this is why I give it 3 out of 5.       This new trend of adding things to classic albums, like this, really treads on a fine line.  When they add to the songs some times they make it a bit sappy.  The Read Hot Chilly Peppers Mothers Milk is one they ruined badly!  It was ruined by adding the extra parts; it made the album sappy, and made me uneasy.  I don't know what it is with this new trend of adding new things to some of these old classics, it's a shame. some times it's cool to add a spin to a old song we hear 1,000 times, but when they start adding some of this new stuff like the techno beat added to the Who song I heard on TV.  It left a bad taste again.  I understand it's cool to update these songs and making them modern and its cool making remixes, but I hope these songs don't become the norm.

1935670913|5|John Locke reveals inside tips about how he sold 1 million ebooks. He discusses how step-by-step he created a fan base that keeps coming back to buy more books. It is important, as an author, to always be aware of the changing field of social media and embrace it as a marketing tool for your book. It's a must read in our Kindle ebook world.<br /><br />As a book publicist I've been recommending it to my clients as soon as it was published. While Locke's books are Fiction, even Non-Fiction authors will find this useful.
0783225792|5|I LOVE this movie. Robert DeNiro is BRILLIANT as always and Sharon Stone was so good in her role as a drug and alcohol addicted slut, that I enjoyed hating her. I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't already seen it. I would also recommend this seller annamack2008, the movie was in the condition the seller advertised and I got it in 2 days(the quickest I've ever gotten anything thru amazon.com).Thanks again.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This is fun and challenging. Hopefully this will improve memory now and prevent memory issues in old age :-)  Great for young minds too! Helps develop neuropathways
B00D7Z4GQY|2|I found this book to be somewhat interesting however the repetition of the same things that people were thinking was too much. I know some repetition is necessary but this book could have been cut down by a third and you would not have missed anything.
B00006JL1Z|2|I don't blame the other reviewers for gushing over this collection, which is fine if the only Fleetwood Mac songs you like come from Nicks-Buckingham and later periods, but any &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection of this band that omits selections from the Welch period (Such as &quot;Hypnotized&quot;) isn't going to win many stars from me.  I'm sticking with the box set &quot;The Chain&quot; which unfortunately isn't easy to find anymore but which is the REAL five star greatest hits collection of this fine band.

B00MI1X58S|5|Whine, cry, whine, cry, Michael Bay ruined my childhood, Boo Hoo. If you sound like this all the time then this review is not for you, because your opinion means nothing. I am 31 and I have grown up with the turtles from the comics up to the terrible live tv show in the late 90's with the girl turtle. The turtles have been a huge part of my life. I say this easily when I say that this reboot was more than any true fan could have expected. Throughout the entire movie they pay homage to the comics, cartoons, and so on. The humor and turtles interaction was hilarious. Besides the incredible suit, you get the feel that The Shredder is a force to be reckoned with, before you ever see him in the suit on screen. The CGI made it easier for better fight scenes and action to be pulled off compared to the stiff suits and animatronics in the 90s. Megan Fox was not great but she didnt hurt the movie either. If you loved the old comics, movies, and old cartoons, then you should love this. Guaranteed that 90% of the bad reviews came from people that already decided they hated the movie way before it came out because Michael Bays name was attached to it, the 10% were people who just genuinely didnt care for it, nothing wrong with that. People need to get off of Bays back. Transformers series is very good. He also gave us Bad Boys series, The Rock, Armageddon, and the new instant classic, under rated and over looked Pain & Gain. Stop hating a man that is doing all the things you wish you could do, being successful.
B000VPUIA6|5|Been a favorite of mine for over 40 years,now it looks and sounds even better,the extra features are quite nice.
B00C061I3K|5|i had to buy this on amazon's site to keep it @ #1.  i just recently discovered daft punk over on billboard and itunes and decided to check out their album on youtube.  talk about going back in time to the late 70s and 80s.  i was feeling the eagles 'hotel california' vibes on some of the songs.  this album is the perfect album to relax and groove to.  i just can't get over how good the whole album is and how addicting it is!!<br /><br />here are my fave tracks so far: doin' it right [i absolutely love that song!!  no doubt this will be a #1 smash on the hot 100!!] fragments of time [reminds me of three's company, or roller skating back in the 80s to some good, fun music!!], get lucky, lose yourself to dance [hotttt song!!], instant crush, motherboard.<br /><br />to those of you who aren't feeling the album, i say give it a couple more listens, esp. driving home from work or riding the bus.  talk about putting you in a good mood!!  great album and congrats to daft punk for their 1st #1 album here in the u.s.!!
B000FC13MM|3|The romance aspect seemed a little forced but the mythology was enough to hold my interest.
B001LF347E|5|I bought this to go back to the beginning of the series - I was watching Season 3 at the time.  Going back to the beginning gave me the insight I was looking for to understand the nuances of the story, the plot and where the story was going.  I love this series.  The actors work so well together and it's a totally different take on the Arthurian Legend than the legends I read in my College English classes!  I love the camaraderie between Prince Arthur and Merlin and the comic twists thrown in the story too.  I have continued to purchase the ongoing series as they became available and it only gets better.  This is most definitely worth the money to get!
B0073U2FB2|5|Awesome!
B000AL730O|4|McCartney proves that he still has considerable talent. It may have taken a decent producer to cut through the McEgo and cull it from the man, but in the end, Chaos is a fine record. Lyrically, the songs deliver in such a pleasant way. After the spotty lyrics on Driving Rain, this album nails it. I enjoyed much of Rain, but the tracks were either musically interesting or lyrically solid. They hardly ever were both at the same time. This album is a much more complete puzzle for the listener. One may approach a new McCartney album looking for solid pop singles (after all, no one outpops Macca,) and this album will be a challenge for those people. If, like me, you own every solo album from Thrillington to Rushes, you will find this album somewhere between the pleading lyrical honesty of Flowers In The Dirt and the pleasant stripped down sound of McCartney. That is not to say that the album is not fleshed out musically. There are great produced moments in most of the songs. Even at the barest moment of simplicity, there are brilliant touches. Listen to the timpani entrance on Jenny Wren (around 1:15 in the song.) There is a nuanced interplay between the subject of the lyrics and the driving beat that plays to our emotions. While the song is one of the weak points lyrically, either Paul or Nigel knew that the emotional core of the song was that crucial line :  \\"She saw poverty breaking up her home.\\" It was a very smart move to introduce the full-on production at that very point. Maybe a good producer is what McCartney has needed for so long. <br /> <br />The album rolls along in a very accomplished manner. It sounds like a complete project instead of random songs thrown together. All of the production sounds even and crisp throughout. The most distinguished sound on the album has to be McCartney's voice. The depth of emotion and quality of expression (that was only hinted at in From A lover To A Friend) is all over the album. It is as if the years have given Paul more vocal power instead of less. Yes, you can hear the age in the voice. I tend to enjoy hearing the clean aspect taken away from his usual vocals. On the whole, there are great moments, bland moments, high points, low points, just like most albums should have. How boring would an album be if every track had the same 120bpm pop \\"pot-boilers\\"? The best of the tracks are How Kind of You, Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain, and Riding To Vanity Fair. The mid-range material is there as well. It is hard to listen to tracks like Certain Softness or Fine Line and not feel that they are lesser efforts than the rest here. That is a fine thing. Every artist needs \\"work\\" songs like this to flesh out an album. <br /> <br />Will you love this album? That's hard to say. If you are a fan of Macca's solo stuff (and lean more toward Flaming Pie, Flowers In The Dirt, or McCartney,) you will enjoy this. If you own All The Best and that's it, you may not get much from this album. Overall, to this fan, I am happy to have this in the catalog. Every artist has to mature and grow. Every fan has to accept that this growth is inevitable. If one only enjoys the man for what he did in the 1960s, he or she will never be truly satisfied with any of his solo material. If one can accept this growth process, knowing that, deep-down, it is all inherently McCartney, then this album will work for you. <br /> <br />By the way, is the background track to Riding To Vanity Fair a left-over from Beck's album, SeaChange? Heh, just kidding...

B005EWDA3I|4|It brought all the strands together with enough intrigue to be exciting as things came to a head. It also left you reflecting what world were you in, a one moon or two.
B00012FXAE|5|Sigourney Weaver returns to face her fears in the surprising Sci-Fi sequel \\"Aliens\\".

B003TSEL7S|5|Started reading Rick Riordan with my son when he was in the third grade (his teacher introduced him to The Lightning Thief as a way to get him to read fiction).  We were both hooked from the start, and have anxiously awaited every installment.  This book introduces us to the next &#34;phase&#34; of their adventure, and introduces us to new characters who will be instrumental in the series development.  These books are well written, and are as interesting to adults as they will be to the grade-schoolers they are intended for.
B005FLX2IQ|3|The quality of the audio is good and also the performance of Peter verygood exhibition.<br />The cd is arrived quickly to destination
B004XJRQUQ|5|After seeing the first two movies, I decided to read the book. Many ideas are the same with few different. I liked how the book had a happy ending. Even though Prim died, mom stayed behind, and Gale stayed in District 2, I am glad Peeta and Katniss are together. They hold each other together and eventually have kids that will not endure a Hunger Games, but will learn the significance of them. I disliked Coin's character, Katniss being followed around by the cameras, Snow's death (no torture), and Prim's death. I would recommend the book to anyone.

1400052181|5|THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is an exceptional book on many levels. I agree with all who have stated what a remarkable job Rebecca Skloot did with what could have been dry material.  The most remarkable aspect of this book was that she successfully demonstrated that right down to the cellular level, EVERY PERSON is an individual. Every person has people they love, and those who love them. Everyone has feelings, and worth. She shows us it would be easy to sink into a debate about the monetary value of a human life, but there is no finite value to the infinite generations who will benefit from the tragic loss of Henrietta's family. They lost their mother, sister, cousin, wife. There is not a dollar amount that will ever give her back. It's a slippery slope to think that we can offer a person money for a life.  Henrietta died in a terrible amount of pain, and her suffering was horribly real. The cells she gave without consent or knowledge have since helped countless people to avoid that pain. A reader can speculate if the doctors approached her and told her, \\"We have no cure today, but the cells from your tumor may prevent other people from suffering this same fate, may we have them?\\" Henrietta might have agreed.  Skloot shines a light on a terrible era in our country, and yet how brightly the human spirit still shines in the face of such tragedy.  Her decade long passionate work has really payed off here.  She helps the reader to understand they didn't experiment on her. The medical staff used the most state of the art treatment they had available to try to help her. This is evidenced by the fact that the people who administered the treatment believed in it so much they suffered the consequences of handling the radium themselves.  Skloot's research revealed that people don't engage in the scientific pursuit of \\"finding a cure\\" for the sake of making mountains of money. They want the cure because they have an understanding at some level how painful loss reallyis. Individuals come up with the desire to stop some horrific disease and all the pain that disease brings, and they approach large companies with the hope of gaining funding for their research.  The money for funding comes from successes these companies have had in the past. If the treatment turns out to be detrimental, these companies suffer the tremendous loss (including the loss of jobs of all who worked for them: families....individuals.....relatives and friends suffer alike).  Rebecca Skloot is an example for us all. She looked beyond the wonder of the sheer numbers of cells, and looked for the person behind the cells. She gave Henrietta back her name, and has helped countless people who handle human cells to know that each culture had a person behind it. A real person with a real family who suffered real loss. Henrietta has moved from being a clinical observation back into being the person she will always be.  Deborah Lacks is said to believe her mother lives on in every person her mom touches. Henrietta Lacks touches countless people and still speaks to us today. Henrietta Lacks puts a face on every cure she's had her cells in, and now will touch the millions who read her story.

0399255370|5|This book follows a series of letters to Duncan from each of the crayons in his crayon box. In the letters each the crayons detail their likes, dislikes and the disputes amongst themselves (is the true color of the sun Yellow or Orange?).<br /><br />Over the past year this has been one of my 4 year old's favorite and most read books. It is also an enjoyable read as a parent, and there are lots of opportunities to adjust and play with the story as you read. I would strongly recommend this book as a core story on the bookshelf of all children.
B000QRIGLC|4|Overall a good read, brought tears to my eyes. Slow going with the whole training start but once the war stories start, it's hard to put down. I finished the book in  a day with great respect and appreciation for SEALS and other armed service members.
B00BWBHIUG|5|The games has been wonder. Until 2days ago. I am having trouble getting back on it keeps saying , having trouble with the network. Can you tell me if this is true, or is the game gone. I am 65 and this game is great for your brain.

006202406X|2|I also absolutely love Windchimed's fanfic version of the 3rd book, Determinant, and want to make sure everyone reads it! It's fantastic! Save your time and money, don't even read Allegiant, read Determinant instead. You won't be disappointed.
B00B5HQLMI|3|All the special effects and cartoonish violence one could possibly want. A good diversion, but not great drama. Worth watching as a Prime selection.

B000007U6V|5|I never would have believed the many people who refer to Autobahn as a highly original piece of art had I not listened to the album myself.  I mean come on- electronic music original?  As ignorant as it sounds, I just didn't think electronic music COULD be original.  What was I thinking?    First of all, I'll be the first to admit I'm normally not particularly fond of electronic music.  This is because most of it repeats extremely simplistic beats for what seems like an endless amount of time over and over again, never really altering a whole lot as far as arrangements are concerned.      As a result... more often than not, I'm left totally bored and confused what the appeal of the entire genre even is.    However, that point of view has now officially been changed thanks to this highly influential piece of electronic music known as Autobahn.      To say Autobahn is years ahead of its time would be a major understatement.  It's at *least* six years ahead of its time.  Listen to this album and try telling me it wouldn't fit in *perfectly* with the new wave scene of the early 80's.  It most certainly would!   Artists like the Cars, Kim Wilde, Men Without Hats, etc. all resemble elements of this band.     I'm completely blown away by Kraftwerk's sudden change in style too- the first couple Kraftwerk albums don't resemble Autobahn in the least.  Those early albums are more like a collection of oddly put together sounds and barely noticeable musical ideas all crammed together to try and create something meaningful (the results arguably not nearly as enjoyable as done here, of course).    Anyway, let's mention the vocal melody in the title song.  Even the *vocal melody* sounds way ahead of its time.  It resembles what the punk rock bands were doing in the early 80's, such as the lead singer of the Clash for example (but obviously without the same kind of aggression as the Clash since, of course, punk and electronic are two completely different styles of rock, but that should go without saying).    It's quite catchy, too.    Then the rest of this 22-minute monster goes through a ton of eerie and haunting (and melodic) electronic sounds.  If Kraftwerk intended to experiment with a style of music not yet heard at the time, then I can't explain where the talented songwriting came from.  The band just had that special mysterious ability I guess.    \\"Kometenmelodie 1\\" is even *creepier* with the electronic sounds which are now slowed down considerably.  Now we're entering haunted house territory, haha.  It's really good, and the melodic aspects floor me quite a bit.  Actually that's not really true- the *originality* of Kraftwerk floors me the most.  You have to respect the originators because not just anybody has the talent to come up with THIS kind of stuff.  \\"Kometenmelodie 2\\" takes the electronic synths and makes them anthemic and even approaches sadness near the end.    Kraftwerk finally settled into a comfortable groove with this one.  No more lengthy flute passages or airplane sounds indicating a war scene- Autobahn is where we have to tip our hats to a band that was just radically different from everyone else back in the mid 70's.
B00H87RLJQ|1|Hmmmm.  How in heavens name did this book win three French literary rewards?
B007IXWKUK|5|A  not to be missed summer time read.. Will keep the reader captivated throughout each chapter ..<br />  It is amazing what the human mind and body can endure, then begin to heal through the power of love
B00004YTIQ|4|We bought this to keep debris and bugs out of the pool, and it works for that purpose, but can't manage to have it tied down like it is in the picture. The box didn't come with instructions on how to tie it down, so we did the best we could. When it's super windy outside, the pool cover slides off the corners and into the pool.
B00CWY76CC|4|Game is very fun. Would be nice if there was a hint button for those times when you get stuck.
B008P1EWIM|2|This looks good, and might would be a great app but I have not been able to change the location settings, it keeps giving the time and weather for California.
B007SGM084|5|Very different  from what I imagined the triology  was about. Kept me interested enough to keep reading. Racy ,sad, funny .Very well done. Kudos to the author.
0307719774|3|I think the question a day thing is great and I know I read about this in the reviews so I'm not too upset about it....<br />There isn't enough space to write anything. If you write really small and only want to answer with one sentence then ya this is a great book for you. I still answer the question but I have a second plain journal to write in also.
B000FC1HBY|5|I'm reviewing these out of order, as I've already finished what is available of the series...<br />But---I tore through this book, just as I did the first one!<br /><br />I have not had a series grab my attention like this in a very, very long time.
B0094BB4TW|4|I like it but there is too many extra &#34;posts&#34; on it.......not sure how they get there but like it as far as seeing what my friends are doing.
B007PTJOV0|5|The coolest game I have played and the little creatures were very cool and detailed I almost didn't want to stomp but awsome. So I will get leps world 2 pretty soon and play it a lot it was total awesomeness.
B003UBTX7C|4|John Carr keeps his friends close and his enemies even closer.  But once again, he can't trust anybody!  A good read with a fast finish.
B0043A0PXU|2|not a good representation of her awesomeness. Too religious
0385344228|5|Wow!  Wasn't ready for the end...not really.  There were hints but I didn't want to believe it.  So I chose not to.  This isthe first William Landay novel I've read, but will read more.  He keeps you wanting more.  when I finished the novel, I still wanted more.  I kept forgetting this was not a true crime drama.  It all seemed so real.  The reader will not want to put the book down, so bfore you start, make sure you have time to read till the end.
B00P42WROG|5|As always. Steven King delivers.This app is great. My first e book.
B009E3EY38|5|Led Zeppelin baby.......... What more to say??
B000093NLE|3|Great album, but it should be mentioned that it's a 45 rpm vinyl. Pressing wasn't done very well and there were quite a few &#34;scratches&#34; even on the first play. This album in general is one of my favorite releases from Radio Head, but I'm ok not having it in my vinyl collection at it's current iteration and pressing.
B000000OAN|5|About the best album of all time. If you have never listened to this before you have missed musical talent of the highest caliber.
B00M7URUUE|2|Probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
B00003CXXO|5|..while some don't think enough. If I had to rely on the opinions of movie critics, both pro and amateur, I don't think I would have ever bought this movie, and that would have been a huge mistake on my part. I loved this movie, and without divulging too much for those who are still on the fence trying to decide to watch it or not, I'll tell why:<br />1) I got it that the mecha boy took fairy tales to be the truth, that he could relate to the Pinocchio character, and that in his eyes the Blue Fairy in the book could solve his problems for him.<br />2) I got it that the one thing that meant more to him than becoming a real boy was being loved by the only mother he ever knew.<br />3) I was so engrossed start to finish that I didn't realize over two hours had gone by when the credits began to roll.<br />4) I was happy for a movie with no blood, only a brief suggestion of sex, and no guns.<br />5) I got it that the screenwriter wasn't trying to solve all the world's problems with one movie. It was about the boy, and the goal he wanted to reach by the end of the script.<br />6) Young Haley Osment is going to go down as one of the best child actors in history. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him make me believe he really was a robot.<br />As an amateur writer, I have to say that I think it took one heck of an imagination to come up with a story like this. I was impressed with the visuals, even the more poignant ones showing an underwater Manhattan, complete with now-nonexistent Twin Towers. I hadn't been this engrossed by a sci-fi movie since the original Close Encounters of the Third Kind in '78, and I've always thought 2001: A Space Odyssey was pure torture. So, frankly, I'm happy to have been unaware of Kubrick's influence while watching the movie, and even happier to learn that his influence was minimal.<br />Sometimes, you can be too much of a brainiac about a movie. Sometimes, you just have to turn the brain off and let your heart and your eyes enjoy the movie. I did, and I don't regret it. Well done.and I don't regret it. Well done.
B004UID2LC|4|Great to have this app and the price is right.  Love finally being able to view you tubes on my Kindle.
B009ANP4F4|5|moose was great in it
B00F1BFRA6|5|Excellent! I liked the DVD's because the story was revealed in consecutive episodes, unlike TV. I love the story and don't want it to end.
B00DURGZHW|5|This movie made me think of  &#34;Stand By Me&#34;.<br />They both involve young boys that are growing up in life.<br />Muc (McCounohy) is not the lead actor in this film.<br />Eliss, a young boy, is the lead in my opinion.<br />McCounohy is probably the big draw for the chicks because this is more of a guy flick.<br /><br />The plot of the movie reminded me of Huckleberry Fin - both need to build a raft to get down river, both have adults being assisted by a young boy.<br /><br />If you like drama and adventure, you will probably enjoy the movie.<br />My lone critique of the movie is that it is somewhat predictable in places.
B00005R2M3|1|Even with the most sophisticated multi million dollar studio equiptment,top notch engineers(and 10,000 takes,no doubt)nothing can't make this warbling,talent free MTV barbie doll listenable.<BR>Her singing on &quot;underneath your clothes&quot; may be perhaps be the worst &quot;singing&quot; one will ever have the displeasure to hear.None of this matters  because she's got the hips and rear;she's highly photogenic,and as usual,the public is gullible enough to swallow the hype for the millionth time.
B000002U82|5|I've read through some of these reviews and I have noticed a pattern concerning the 1 star reviews...  They're all from kids. <br /> <br />Honestly, the first time I heard this, I thought it was weird, a lot of it boring, and I didn't get it; however, after I watched the Pink Floyd Live 8 reunion, I became absolutely hooked.  You really do have to be musically mature to get this.  I just reached that point after turning 18, myself.  I had heard this was the greatest album ever made, and now I understand why.  It's timeless, about the pressures of everyday life and how they can turn one to madness.  The albums of Pink Floyd's golden period all had a quality that they would acknowledge some faults of the world, and not offer a solution, but hope that things will turn out all right in the end.  The music accompanies one through the pressures of life. <br /> <br />Dark Side of the Moon and Pink Floyd in general have completely changed my life, my view of the world, and has also made me want to take up the guitar, which I have taught myself.  I play a Fender Stratocaster like David Gilmour.  Before I became obsessed with Pink Floyd I never paid attention to lyrics in music.  I mostly listened to Jazz.  The pleasing sound of Pink Floyd drew me in and the lyrics that really make one think are what got me hooked. <br /> <br />I'd also like to recommend The Wall (A VERY close second to this album to me), Animals, Wish You Were Here, Meddle...  oh and to the kid who said Ummagumma was their debut album..  it wasnt...  each member was given an LP side with which to experiment, so they could find themselves artisitically, but their first album was actually The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. <br /> <br />I can only hope you kids will one day understand the pure greatness of Dark Side of the Moon.  I one day tried to think of ways it could be improved..  I had nothing, it is absolutely perfect.  Oh, and Pink Floyd isnt really stoner music..  Roger Waters once said \\"You don't have tobe stoned to enjoy our stuff. But it can help.\\" <br /> <br />I'll see you on the Dark Side of the Moon..
B008JFUR10|4|Got exactly what I ordered. The movie is pretty entertaining for a &#34;B&#34; sci-fi flick.
B00NEQRNVG|3|It's not that I didn't like this book. I did! I thought Eva finally became a strong and admirable character. And Gideon, as frustrating as he is, still made my heart melt. It's just that after waiting 2 years I was a little disappointed. So much was touched on but nothing really happened. I'm still a little bitter that we had to wait so long for this book too. Will I read the next one? I'm sure I will.
B000VYX8PE|1|this book is completely sad there are no happy it was depressing and the whole time I felt they author was dead serious about the kids lives. I also felt like the counts eye addiction was not explained and it also left me questioning the judge I do not see how she didn't see that the marriage document was real.
B00DPM7TIG|5|I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. The story envelops the reader completely.  The characters capture the reader's imagination.
B00VFTAXUC|5|Even watching it a second time was great!
B000066NW0|5|You people make me laugh.  <br />It's funny how the \\"punkers\\" have such depth of hatrid for anyone they feel isn't \\"really\\" punk.  Get real people.  There is no such thing now - punk was in the 80's.  And who cares if her image is contrived?  Everyone in the music biz (that's successfull, at least) is manufactured to some degree.  At least I don't cringe when an Avril tune comes on the radio like I do when a tune from Britney does.<br />And for some of you who hate her so bad, you sure spent a lot of time researching her supposed hypocracy.  Or did you pull those \\"facts\\" and quotes out of thin air (or worse, other ranters' posts)?<br />The few articles I've seen on Avril say that she was NOT picked up by several record labels because she wanted harder edged music than they did.  The articles also said she insisted on writing her own stuff.  True, they got her professional writers,  but I've yet to see any official source say she didn't contribute ANYTHING to her songs - more than can be said for most of 'em these days including Clay Aikin and the rest of the manufactured American Idol phenoms.  <br />This reminds me of my friend who hates Led Zepplin.  He says they are fakes who did nothing but rip off poor, black, blues artists.  Hmmm, I prefer the opinion that they revolutionized Rock and Roll with their hard edged blues and unique style (and they showed a much broader range of styles than most bands do).  <br />That's my 2 cents.  Don't be afraid to buy the album.  I'd give it 4 stars but I felt the need to counter some of the egregious 1 star ratings from the screamers.
B006OOHYIC|5|this is a wonderful way to relax at the end of the day. I don't enjoy the music as much as the original, but it's still nice.
B00G5G7EXY|5|It's a  really  net movie for  the  first time  of seeing it  lot's of  little  kids would like  it

B005ZOBNOI|5|This book will certainly remind you to cherish your healthy children!
1594484805|1|Rhetorical yet incoherent - who knew such a thing was possible?<br />The author simplifies people/companies and manipulates literature/scientific findings to fit his needs. Though the concepts he presents are worthy of discussion and implementation - he should not be the one receiving credit or royalties for their &#34;discovery&#34;.  Pink is not a scientist and should not be renaming scientific concepts that others have discovered to line his own pockets and pad his ego.  If you read the book, please remember to give credit where credit is due. Remember Maslow and his hierarchy of needs. Remember that altruism and personal satisfaction are in themselves rewards.
B000GIXEIG|5|I saw this film on Blu-ray and really enjoyed it.  Hollywood did a high tech schmaltzy version of the epic poem Beowulf starring Angela Jolie and Anthony Hopkins.  I didn't see it.  This film neither has a stratospheric budget or shock and awe special effects, but it has fine actors, good writers and fine direction and cinematography, telling the story of Beowulf & Grendel as Hollywood with its arrogant suits and risk averse formulas could never produce it.  This Beowulf & Grendel will reintroduce you to classic filmmaking.    Not only is it well worth a watch, this film is well worth a place in your film collection.
B00BVYLBP2|5|An interesting and compelling show. Each episode gets more interesting as the season progresses
B004V6BQ3O|5|Looked at other mic's before purchasing this one to see if I could save a few bucks, but as always, quality trumps all. Haven't had the chance to really use it yet, but I'm sure it will be superb.
B0046B8GEQ|5|My wife and I loved almost everything about this movie.  The plot was fun and creative.  The characters were fresh and believable.  And the content was family friendly.  The only thing we could have done without were Vector's disgusting hip thrusts.  Other than that, we'd highly recommend for adults or children and we're looking forward to the sequel.
B00A6CCF0K|5|I have read all of Stephen King and I have a bad habit of gobbling up the book. I slowed it down and enjoyed it from front to back. Great story. Great dialogue.

B008XG1X18|5|I love this app so much you can pretty much look at anything. The only problem with it is that it takes for ever to update. I mean all my friends have  the update and I still don't. So happy I can get it on my kindle
B000W9399S|3|I haven't read a fantasy title in decades (the last one I'd classify that way is &#34;Hitchhiker's Guide&#34;.)  I saw good reviews for the Discworld series, and thought it would be a good re-entrance (my favorite series was Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd & the Grey Mouser books.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise to meet &#34;Hrun&#34; and &#34;the Weasel&#34;!  The first thing I thought when I came across them (very early in the book) was, &#34;Is he satirizing Leiber (who was pretty satirical himself)?&#34;  It sort of colored my take on the whole book.  Even though the Weasel disappeared and only Hrun appeared later.<br /><br />The story was sort of fun, but I wasn't moved enough by it to continue the (is it 23 book?) series.
B006WQLH7G|5|It is the same anti-virus software I use on my personal computer. I have had no problem with the software.

No matter what topic you turn to in The 4-Hour Body, you will find well written, on-the-ground experience reduced to the essentials of taking action and finding personal success.  Now I want to be clear that I haven't tried everything in the book.  I know, from personal experience, however, that in a few sections of The 4-Hour Body, Tim has distilled work that took others many years to perfect, into a simple and engaging how-to, that has the potential to literally transform any couple's physical relationship.  This alone is worth the price of the book if you read nothing else in the book.    Tim's writing style is fun, engaging, and highly informative.  If you care anything about your body, you will not be disappointed when you open this book, whether you you actually take action from the information in its pages, or simply sit back and be entertained.  Either way, you will win.

B000IOMYDY|5|This is an absolute classic, even if you're not a Joy Division super fan or you were born after it was released (like me:), i believe this record is a must have for any music lover, its a part of history ;) I read some of the reviews, the only negative one seems to be about sound quality / flaws on the imported version. I have an imported version as well, made in Spain, and there are no issues whatsoever with it. No skipping at all. So im thinking they may have just gotten a dud, unfortunately. Mine is near perfect - the only thing I mind about it is that there is no song list on the cover or on the vinyl itself, just the name of the band and album, but other than that i love it.
B000008GEF|5|Probaly the most underrated album of all time.  A great piece of work.  I could never understand why this album never got the praise it deserves.  Expectations too high after ATMP maybe?  But jeez: if this isn't good enough for you, there's something wrong with you. At least it did make it to #1, which it certainly deserved.  In many ways it's a stronger work than ATMP.  The writing is more consistent in overall quality.  And the sound is way, way better.  The production job on this album is excellent. One of the best produced albums from a former Beatle and without question George's best produced album. Very meaty R&B sound (reminiscent of \\"Savy Truffle\\" from the Beatles' white album) on many of the tracks.  Great sax, piano and guitar work. And Harrison's singing is the best of his career on this album. A shame he didn't bring the same quality of production to subsequent albums instead of opting for a softer, etheral sound. Not a lot of depth to the lyrics perhaps but - I dunno - overall it sounds awfully [darn] good to me.  I recently listened to LITMW after getting his superb last album, \\"Brainwashed\\" which I initially thought may have been better. In fact, several songs on \\"Brainwashed\\" exceed anything on LITMW (especially lyrically) and his slide playing on several \\"Brainwashed\\" songs is the best of his career, but overall LITMW packs a heavier punch. Bottom line: great mid-70's rock that still sounds great 30 years later.

B00BMT9SQA|5|I am a 21 year old MALE and i thought this movie was killer!  You gotta eak through the first half, its a bit slow. But the ending is great.  Seth Rogan is hilarious and I'm not sure if i've been spending to much time in the engineering building (no girls.. at all) but Barb was looking pretty good.<br /><br />Id say.. check cha check it OUT! ha
B004ZJZQCE|1|I purchased and then returned this.  It is the EXACT flipper disc--complete with scratches on the dvd side--as before.  Also there is no physical digital disc.  This also holds for the Jackal/Mercury Rising double disc set except the standard side has special features.  If you want a single-sided blu-ray, get Der Schakel, a German import.  It has a good english audio option with no subtitles and the quality of the blu-ray is excellent.  F

0446563048|4|Delivering Happiness is part biography, part management/strategy, part philosophy and self-help.  It's a quick read, but the first 30 pages of the book devoted to Tony Hsieh's adolescent life are not all that interesting.  In fact, it's a downright ordinary life for an Asian American.  Only after he starts to describe his life at Harvard does the book starts to capture one's interest.  I thought that the section where he compares poker to business enlightening as it can also be true for investing.  I guess that's why so many great investors are also card players.  One characteristic of Tony that you immediately notice is how lazy he can be, especially when it has anything to do with the things he's bored with.  It's a bit surprising that he got into Harvard with such an attitude.  That behavior carried into his career later at his first start-up, LinkExchange.  Like a typical serial entrepreneur, he lives off the excitement of the chase.  It makes one wonder how long he will stay at Zappos after it's well established?  Especially now that it's sold to Amazon.<br /><br />The crux of his philosophy is that a company's culture = people = brand.  Hardly original but it's interesting how far they've been able to make it work at Zappos.  They do it with their 10 core values.<br /><br />Deliver WOW through service<br />Embrace and drive change<br />Create fun and a little weirdness<br />Be adventurous, creative, and open minded<br />Pursue growth and learning<br />Build open and honest relationships with communication<br />Build a positive team and family spirit<br />Do more with less<br />Be passionate and determined<br />Be humble<br /><br />After reading the book I have more questions than answers.  First, how much of Tony's success is due to luck?  The road to entrepreneurial success is littered with people who are just as smart, ambitious, hard-working and tenacious.  The casualty rates are very high.  In fact, Zappos almost went under in the beginning if not for the willingness of Tony to \\"bet the farm\\" on it's survival.  Most \\"smart\\" entrepreneurs would not have done such a foolish thing.  It's not rational, but he did.<br /><br />Second, can you actually transfer core values?  I think the answer is no.  Companies have a way of adopting the ethos of their founders or whoever is running it.  That's why Apple is Steve Jobs .  That's why Google is Sergey and Larry.  Those 10 core values are a derivative of Tony Hsieh.  Sure, you may say that it's a collaborative patchwork of employee inputs, but ultimately it's more of a reflection/by-product of Tony and his values.<br /><br />That's not to say the someone can't get good ideas from his book, you just have to adapt it to fit your organization and your ethos.<br /><br />After reading the book you have a sense of admiration for Tony and the employees at Zappos.  They have overcome enormous odds.  It's also not hard to imagine, even without taking one of their famous company tours that the company is stocked with extroverts.  It would seem that someone who's an introvert would have a hard time fitting into their outgoing and sunny disposition driven culture.<br /><br />Finally, there have been plenty of studies that have shown that people who are happy are more willing to take risks than those who are not.  I hope that Tony would keep this in mind going forward as some of his decisions earlier in his career can clearly be thought as being reckless.st \\"smart\\" entrepreneurs would not have done such a foolish thing.

B00475AYJQ|5|The second book in the series, the story continues Kvothe's adventures as a young man, traveling, learning, and growing. Excellent story has kept me reading long into the night. Highly readable and strongly recommended for sword and sorcery lovers.
B000002A3T|5|The Division Bell is a classic and overlooked by fans. It's a bit lighter and less rock oriented but still very powerful and still original. It's actually not bad lyrically but it's much better musically. I'm a huge fan of Pink Floyd from their early psychedelic rock with Syd Barrett to their final days in the mid '90s. '70s is without a doubt, their best era but they had good stuff afterwards and it was generally overlooked. The Final Cut was another misunderstood album and put down by fans for it being too depressing. It wasn't an album for the radio though, it was a darker and more creative side to the band. Momentary Lapse Of Reason and Division Bell have some of the dark themes but were much lighter after the departure of Roger Waters. Momentary Lapse of Reason was an excellent album also but I prefer The Division Bell. In my opinion, it's their best work since 1979's The Wall.<br /><br />Highlights: High Hopes, Keep Talking, What Do You Want From Me?, Wearing The Inside Out, Marooned
B00B0LPYXG|4|I thought Denzel was great in this. The story line was interesting and something everyone can relate too.
B00HANI3Z4|2|Thomas and whoever he pairs with to hurt others, is getting just too much. Either change him to a good guy or fire or kill him off.  I like characters who are interesting, not just mean.<br /><br />Matthew should have replaced with another actor rather than kill him off. His character is very missed.<br /><br />Show more of the children.<br /><br />Can't they give Edith a true eligible man?

The first time EVER that I have EVER gone through all the so that :-)) I can leave a review.<br /><br />Amazon you are so close to being 100% on this game I almost gave it to you but you know how petsnikety the universe can be about stuff how it is almost impossible to cheat on the old broad.  Well just between you and me I was able to fudge slightly.  Oooooooo now remember mum is the word here.  When I was coloring in your rating stars I colored ever so lightly, and technically gave you 4.5 stars but it looks like 5 hehehe.<br /><br />Truth is Sparkle HD is so close to  being a Luxor game.  It truly is a Luxor game except it is called Sparkle and not Luxor.  Well in all honesty there are a few things that Luxor has that Sparkle HD doesn't, I just almost cried.<br /><br />I know you have noticed how circumspect and restrained I have been and how I have only mentioned Luxor 46,976,563 total and well a real nice gift to a real nice and devoted AmaZon customer like me would be a for true life  gift of any Luxor game, except for Luxor slots game cuz they pretty much suck.  No offense intended  but that Luxor slot game just out &amp;dwand out bites the big one.  So dear AmaZon could you see kwhat you could do please.  Sorry if I come across alls
B00IX9UTLU|5|Great story, appealing , sexy characters,

B0007MWZEK|5|I have now had my swivel sweeper(s) for over a year (got it for Christmas in 2005).  I immediately bought another one to have at the cabin.  I have not had a problem with the battery.  I use it pretty much daily.  If mine ever dies, I will definitely replace it with a new one.  I paid about $35 for it, and as far as I'm concerned, I have gotten my money's worth. <br /> <br />Keep in mind it's a sweeper, not a vacuum.  Yes, you will still need to vacuum and wash your floors.  We have a very large kitchen and I use it all the time to go around the edges and under the stools at the island to sweep up crumbs, dust bunnies, etc.  It works like a charm and I no longer have to get down on my hands and knees to wipe up with a rag.  LOVE IT!  RECOMMEND IT!

0440219078|5|The Giver is about Jonas, a boy who lives in a seemingly perfect world - with no illness, no crime, and no individuality.  When Jonas turns twelve he is assigned a job as the Receiver of Memories for the community.   <br />Through his assigned profession he learns there is more to life than  sameness.  He discovers colors, feel, pain, love, war, and much more.  Soon  Jonas becomes discontent with his simple life in his simple community and  goes on a quest looking for a world that can provide more.<br />The Giver  captures the pricelessness of individuality and the cost that some  societies have to pay to be different.  This is one of the few remarkable  Newberies that EVERYONE should read.  I strongly recommend this incredible  book.

0393061310|5|This book while tough to get through at times is meticulously researched and will give you an amazing idea of how societies survived and thrived through the ages. The obvious that we take so much for granted, food, tools, shelter and the animals we raise are the links to civilizations that have disappeared and those that have flourished.
B00021HBGS|5|These were a big hit with my grandson . Now I have another grandson who is 18mos, and he loves them also! The grandson I originally bought them for is 3 and he still plays with them. A great fun product, easy to use, and a great value.
B00FAPF5U0|4|I really enjoy this game! It has a nice mix of challenging and easier levels. I don't like stopping to ask friends to let me continue.
B003XT60KO|5|The contents are superb and worth listening to. This book taught me real economics and principles to live by. The lesson is about 5 pages long and the resto of the chapters are the lesson played out in different scenarios. Hazlitt was a genious for his time and his works will continue to effect those after him as it has influenced me. If you don't understand economics, then one read through this will open your eyes to how easy it is to understand things when you have the correct principles and right perspective on things.
B000VAPZM2|5|I've already seen this movie a few times, and I'm quite a bit older than the intended fan base, but as far as movies go, especially tv movies, HSM2 really did a decent job at capturing kids' imagination. And even after the vanessa hudgens scandal, I still think that this is a truly outstanding movie from Disney that will go down as a Disney classic in the years to come.
B000QRIGLC|5|Outstanding.  Hated to put it down.  God bless the United States of America and God bless the United States Military.  Thank you for all you do and have sacrificed.
B00BMCAM6M|5|dead on Radio!
6303314015|5|By far the greatest disney film ever and the most succuessful animated film of all time.  it had it all. great plot , great animation that couldnt be replaced by any computer, excellent character design, the best voice acting for an animated film ever, incredible score, everything that made a film great.  what citizen kane did for movies today, the lion king did for the animated universe.  they raised the bar three times over for a kids film.  somewhere in this time , disney got into thinking too much of themselves and believed everything they did was going to sell like crazy.  they lost the magic and they started creating some movies of subpar quality like Atlantis, and treasure planet.  i wont stray too far away from the movie im rating.  it was this movie that set disney apart from other companies and thier work.  i hope they get the magic back into filming and soon.
B00AHHODH2|5|Story-telling at its best!  I would have given it four stars until I learned this was part of a trilogy and the few questions I felt were unanswered would be answered later.  The story will keep you guessing until the very end!  Wonderfully written and fun throughout.  I've already read it twice just to pick up the little hints I may have missed the first time.  I can't wait to read more of Duncan's stories!
B004ZMWUCU|5|I loved this book.  I would recommend it to any one.  Can't wait to read another book by Christian McKenna.
B0076DCT2G|1|This is the first book read by this author and was very disappointed.  I can not believe all the good reviews.  I guess others like the smart-alec main character.  It became tedious at best.  Never again!
B0007TKNI8|5|I've seen this movie twenty times or more and I still love it.  The music it great, the story is great.  Somehow you want the phantom to win but know he can't.  It's just terrific.   I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't love this movie.
0679731369|2|This is a book which some notable authors praise (Graham Greene and John Fowles for example) but I did not enjoy due to its constant references to the reader especially about writing. For example Barnes writes: \\"The imagination doesn't crop annually like a reliable fruit tree. The writer has to gather whatever's there: sometimes too much, sometimes too little, sometimes nothing at all.\\" The result was a smorgasbord of thoughts and ideas often bland and unpalatable. True, there were scattered within some wonderful snippets such as Barnes' rant about the late Dr Enid Starkie, Reader Emeritus in French Literature at the University of Oxford. It was when Barnes wrote about Flaubert's character and life that the novel picked up but when the narrator, Geoffrey Braithwaite, came to the fore, ennui set in. Barnes had obviously done considerable research into Flaubert's life but if you are looking for an enjoyable literary read, I suggest read Madame Bovary and leave Flaubert's Parrot on the shelf.
B0054JZC6E|5|fun to play! and challenging!  the hardest one is the caterpillar some of them r easy sum are hard... it is cool and fun.I recommend playyingnit
B00AJLHU3K|5|Of course, Richard Thompson fans must/will buy this.  I hope some that are not yet fans will as well - it will likely start many on an astounding backwards trek through his amazing catalogue. RT has never put out an album that wasn't at least pretty good.  Electric is better than pretty good.  It is excellent.  It is better than his previous release, Dream Attic, which was very good but not quite as good as Mock Tudor, Old Kit Bag, or Sweet Warrior to mention only relatively recent releases.  The consistency of quality of the songs and performances here is probably rivaled only by Mock Tudor.<br />Although Electric actually has a pretty good balance of rock and folk, it will probably especially appeal to those (like me) who particularly enjoy RT's electric guitar playing.  There are 5 songs here (Stony Ground, Sally B, Stuck on the Treadmill, Good Things Happen to Bad People, and Straight and Narrow) that it is easy to imagine RT extending the guitar solo into one of those epic performances during a concert (a la Can't Win, Put it There, Pal, or, best of all, Hard on Me).  Yet there are plenty of softer songs as well and they are equally good.  The Gordon Lightfoot-esque Salford Sunday and My Enemy are personal favorites.  I am also surprised to say that my favorite song of all is the country-flavored Saving the Good Stuff for You.  It's a great way to end the CD on a truly uplifting note.  Of course, the bonus songs are excellent as well.  Will You Dance, Charlie Boy may remind some of RT/Swarbrick interplay and I Found a Stray is both haunting and beautiful.<br />I hope Electric and the upcoming tour gain Richard Thompson some new fans.  He deserves them.  I certainly can't imagine he has ever lost a fan once he has gained one.

B000NA28IE|5|I really enjoyed this movie. I had listened to both books on tape and found them facinating and thoroughly thrilling. I wish the movie could have incorporated more from the book but working with a limited amount of time I think they did and excellent job. The characters were fairly well developed and the choice of actors was excellent. Saphira was beautiful and her essense was so very well rendered. I'm very much looking forward to seeing books 2 and 3 put on film. I will watch them without a doubt and will continue to listen to the tapes over and over again. I am 57 years old. You see what you choose to see and not compare to other like enterprises. I was lost in the fantasy that could only be Eragon.
B007N8RULO|5|This is the one I play the most. Started using the 2 decks. It is very challenging. That is what I like best.
0345505387|2|Just briefly, I want to state my main disappointments.  I struggled to tell the male characters apart.  The story lost its storyline since every other \\"bubble\\"  I had to try to figure out who was speaking.  Hair color, beard or beardless?  It was not fun.  Murtagh wasn't older and funny looking, for example.  He looked pretty much like Dougal, who looks like Colum (when Colum is sitting - ok he may be more pale) who looks like Kenneth, who looks like Randall when Randall wasn't in his red uniform.  I did like the distinctive drawing of the lawyer and Colum's bodyguard -- two characters I could recognize and enjoy.  Also, this was a familiar story told from the viewpoint of a different character (Murtagh).  But we didn't learn anything new about Jamie and Claire.  Therefor, I give this book a low score.  I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1, because it is a book of art, and tells a story in a different way which may appeal to a different set of fans.  However, to fans of the novels, this won't be satisfying or adding to the story.  (I disregard the Kenneth storyline, since it didn't add any new knowledge to the original story).  Had the characters had more distinction, I would have given more stars just for the beauty of the drawings.
B004T2QZL8|5|I love this game, so it gets 5 stars. but honestly, there's next to zero animation in this game, it shouldn't tax the system in any way so why so much stuttering and force closing? I can only guess it's poor programming. could be the device (fire) but since pretty much everything else I've played runs smooth I'm disinclined to believe that. and finally, stop begging for 5 star reviews and threatening to withhold updates. it's distinctly unsavory.ask for reviews, that's fine, but earn your 5 stars. Aside from the graphical and occasional gameplay issues this game is brilliant. 5 stars for concept.
B000MVN8GK|5|Marshmallow here. How could anyone not love this show-- I've spent hours pondering the psychological dynamics of the characters, laughing at the snarky humor, and smiling over the sweetness of the father/daughter relationship between Keith and Veronica. Rob Thomas can do no wrong in my book.

B00BXKOMT6|4|A very well told medieval themed fantasy with just a little sorcery which makes one look forward to the next in the series.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Great game to keep you busy. Just wish it recharged faster.
B00L8FC1QM|5|Been a fan since I was a kid. The 98 version was horrific and only watched once. This on does justice to the series, making it in a way if it was in real life. I love all the little hidden stuff in the movie. If you watch the background and foreground closely you can see them. Pays homage to more than just the original series. Look for the Mothra references in the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5|I really enjoy this game. To those of you that are have trouble with closing tap menu in the bottom right corner then tap options the home bar should show up after you bring up the options menu. Then u can either tap the house on the left side or the back arrow. If u push the back arrow the game will ask u if you are sure you want to exit. This game is an very enjoyable game...

B001EIOOV8|4|Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese's<br />1995 crime drama based on the book. A man reflects his life in the mob<br />with his wife and friend while managing a casino. This is a great film<br />and I like it just as much as &#34;Goodfellas.&#34; This blu-ray has nice picture<br />and sound plus some neat extras. I recommend this good blu-ray.
B005LAIGOQ|2|I admit it.  I only saw this movie due to curiosity about how Daniel Radcliffe would look as someone other than Harry Potter.  He does well, but it almost seems familiar settings to have him in old buildings lit by candles.<br /><br />It's hard to say why this movie just does not entertain ........ it is visually rich - great sets, locations, wardrobe, etc ........ the actors all do well with their lines and all the characters are believable.  BUT the movie just NEVER draws the viewer into it.  All the \\"scary parts\\" rely on standard formulas - something moving in the background (that the hero never sees until it's too late) or something popping up suddenly (BOO!).<br /><br />It is just totally flat - one note - no depth at all.  Maybe the book was more engaging - I hope so.  The ending is disappointing and predictable.<br /><br />So, if you HAVE to see this movie - rent it.  This is NOT worth buying.

B0036TGSIK|1|I give this a one star out of 5 for the following reasons:     1) I love cute teen comedies like \\"10 Things I Hate about You,\\" \\"Can't Hardly Wait,\\" \\"17 Again,\\" \\"Never Been Kissed,\\" and everything by John Hughes, and this one doesn't even come close to those    2) The acting was really, really, really bad from everyone (even amazing actors like Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow, and Thomas Hayden Church)     3) The script/plot was all over the place and maybe I'm just used to unrushed, yet fun and interesting movies like the ones mentioned in #1, but I had no idea what was going on or what the hell anyone was talking about. Or maybe I'm just slow :)     4) The movie did not feel genuine. Before you say, \\"IT'S A MOVIE!\\" a quality teen comedy can suspend your disbelief and make you reminisce/cringe (in a good way.) In one of my favorites, \\"17 Again,\\" where a disgrunted businessman (Matthew Perry) is switched in the body of his high school self (Zack Efron) so he can go back and help his own kids who are in high school and try to repair the relationship with his estranged wife (Leslie Mann,)the acting is amazing. Zack Efron has great chemistry with everyone from his weirdo best friend to his \\"wife\\" to his \\"son.\\" The feelings feel real and the movie, although fun and fast-paced takes it's time and hardly ever feels like the writers are \\"trying too hard,\\"--maybe once or twice. Easy A was the total opposite. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters or the script on any level.     5) It is embarrassing that scripts this bad are not only produced, but actually do well. To me, this was the high school equivalent of \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\"    6) I didn't even have the patience to finish this. I would rather watch Jersey Shore, and I hate Jersey Shore.

B009MCRHH6|3|My almost 3 year old daughter doesn't quite grasp this app, although it is a pretty interesting one to play. Maybe when she is older! I do not have the patience to sitdown and go from level to level (which you can skip the ones you just can not get). I would say that older children would enjoy this.
1594489505|3|This book just didn't hit me like Kite Runner, but I still found myself very emotional during the whole book.  I think part of it could have been that this was taken from a female perspective and, I am happy to say that, I just don't have that perspective.  I know I gave it a low rating but that is only because I had to compare it to Kite Runner.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, especially women, but I did not come out with a desire to fly a kite or treat my friends nicer.  There were just fewer connections here.

Will read it again no doubt. Read it you will not be sorry. Hope her next book is as good. Be hard to beat this one.

B007SYWFRM|5|A very fun and addictive game. You can basically play this game forever. There is always something new to do!
B000AP04L0|5|Seriously funny stuff. I'd have to say that there are a ton and a half catch phrases I use often at work from this excellent movie. With 500 5 star reviews, I doubt very much that you need a review of the story, so I'll just say that it's a fantastic goof on the world's worst workplace: Every office cube farm in America. As a administrative worker of 15 years, who has spent far to much time in one cube farm or another, I found this movie very relatable and pretty hysterical. No, I don't hate my job, as some other reviewers have stated. Yes, I do have the moron boss that pawns his work off on me. (dosn't everyone? I do a better job anyway.) I won't \\"burn the place to the ground\\" one day. (why bother?) But I may just \\"office space\\" that super-delux copier that never works properly one day when no one is looking! LOL

B000PMLFRA|1|I don't understand why George Lucas refuses to give fans a high-quality transfer release of the original theatrical cuts of the Star Wars trilogy. For those of us who don't like the tweaks, the lame revisions (Han shot first) or the overdubbing (I liked the original Boba Fett, thanks very much), this release is just another slap in the face to film buffs, historians, and preservationists.    They say if you whitewash something long enough, people will cease to remember it. Sadly, that's what Lucasfilm seems to want to do - whitewash the superior versions of the Star Wars films until newer generations don't know any better.     Shame.

B00D7NWTSI|1|Face it, a lot of people here are not reviewing this product sold on Amazon. They are telling you if they liked the movie or not. Many may even be posting a review on this 'product' based on seeing the movie at the theater.<br /><br />Is it an appropriate review of the product to say it's too expensive? Not just a little off but waaaaay too expensive?<br /><br />The product is this package of discs. The price is outrageous. I therefor feel that it's appropriate to criticize \\"The Product\\" for sale here as poor.<br /><br />On some retail sites, you'll see a ratings broken up into qualities, such as effectiveness, and value. Then those values are averaged. Amazon does not have a separate star rating for value.

B001N26GFM|3|The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is yet another take on the horrors of the holocaust. So many horrors, I'd venture to say, that a hundred more books and movies could be made about it. Although I was born in America and was never  personally touched by the Holocaust, in a way I actually was. As a child I saw the horrific photos of piles of emaciated bodies lying in heaps and it colored my world. I think at that moment I knew how the world was and I became an Athiest on the spot and gratefully stayed one. I never want to believe in a God that would or could let that happen for any reason. It still bothers me when people (usually Christians or other religious people} think that God personally caters to them when there are people laying in the dirt somewhere starving to death. Same with the Holocaust. Why would God do this or that, but let the Holocaust happen? The ability to live your life with blinders on must be nice, but that is what happened on a monumental scale in Germany. And this film, as flawed as it is, is yet another chilling example of what happens when you do. The movie is well made. Great music, acting, attention to detail, except for one very glaring fact. Yes, it was set in Germany, but everyone has a distinct English accent. Even the strawberry blond evil Nazi youth has a distinct English accent, as do the Jews in the concentration camp. There isn't a German accent to be found anywhere. Maybe someone on the movie set had one, but no one in the movie does, which I think has a detrimental effect on the whole thing. I couldn't help but think about England during this period. They were being terrorized by Hitler too, yet the movie has the good guys and the bad guys all speaking with English accents. It was hard to get past and a little unsettling. English accents are, for lack of a better word, usually pretty. The actors accents gave the whole movie a genteel feel, which a Holocaust movie should never have. Funny no one who has reviewed this film mentioned the English accents because I kept waiting for the Nazis to have a tea party. It drained the movie of true menace and made it seem unrealistic. If it weren't for the performances of the two boys and the mother, the movie really could have sunk in my opinion... that is until the ending, which is absolutely chilling. I was stunned and had to recover from it. But afterwards it made me realize how badly I wanted what preceded it, to have even half the impact the ending does. It was so good, but it could have been nearly perfect with a little tweeking.he English accents because I kept waiting for the Nazis to have a tea party.

B004FOA84A|3|I loved this game, and my wife thoroughly enjoyed it as well. However, I completed it in about 40 minutes the first time through, and my wife finished it in about the same. The second play through of it for me was only 20 minutes.  Less than an hour of content doesn't justify more than $0.99 price for me. Needs another game, or additional content through an update.  The puzzles are fun, and the graphics are acceptable. Gameplay mechanics are reasonable and predictable in most cases.

006135323X|3|Dan Ariely's book is an interesting toe dip into the murky waters of behavioral economics.  Prompted by his own personal tragedy and his torturous rehabilitation, Ariely has spent much of his life studying the seemingly meaningless choices humans make, and the rationalizations we create for making them.  Everything from cheating to choosing beer is analyzed by him and his team, and the conclusions he draws are fairly interesting.<br /><br />Not all that convincing, though.  Much of his data comes from rather small sample sets, and many of his experiments seem unreplicable.  Plus -- and this is a given in any social science -- his analysis also seems over-simplified.  In the experiment on cheating, for instance, Ariely merely assumes that the students cheat when their scores deviate from the mean (when I would assume it would make more sense to install hidden cameras to catch students cheating).  And when he tries to deduce why people behave in the ways they do, he limits his choices to a few polar contradictions.  He goes for the \\"either/or\\" when, of course, people are far more complicated than one or the other.  Again, it's hard to test for all of the possibilities, but that's also why I'd be more likely to accept his results if his experimental sets were in the thousands instead of just a few hundred.<br /><br />I find his conclusions most intriguing, in fact, when they deal more with the economics aspect of the science.  His points about the presumptions implicit in the free market system are the most convincing of the book.  (I especially like his ideas for credit card companies to reduce debt.)  Don't get me wrong, the book is still a fairly interesting read, even if Ariely's narration is rather weak (and his occasional attempts at humor are eye-rolling).  As a springboard for discussion or a prompt for deeper study, the book succeeds.  In and of itself, though, the book reads more like a nifty nugget of an idea than a revelation of anything new or groundbreaking.
B000W1V5VU|5|...to the top reviewers who gave this a 3-star rating.  My take is this: If you enjoyed 11, and pretty much hated 12, you'll find 13 to be a perfect match of the style of 12 and the substance of 11.<br /><br />The thing I liked the most in Oceans 13 was the \\"cool factor\\".  While it is stylish, as 12 was (almost to a motion-sickness fault), it also features a lot of dialogue back and forth between the characters that clearly are having a great time being a part of this plot. The interaction and chemistry (not to mention inside jokes pertaining to their real-life celebrity personalities) is smooth and seamless, and the movie flows better than 11.<br /><br />Back again is the impossible theft scenario that unravels as the movie unfolds.  Granted, on second viewings the surprise is gone, but I found myself enjoying the scenery even more on additional viewings, and there are some genuinely funny moments that I missed the first time.<br /><br />I can't speak for everyone, but I loved it.

0066214122|1|Michael Crichton must have phoned this one in. I've never written a review before but I felt this novel was such a stinker I had to respond. I think I've read all his books. I look forward to a new Crichton novel but, holy suffering swarms of bugs, what a mess this thing is. Did his ex get this in the divorce settlement?<br />I listened to this on an audio tape. After about 3 of the tapes, I started to use the fast forward button to try and speed things up. I didn't help. I couldn't descibe the plot of this book this book because it's so stupid. Yea, we know about the swarms of bugs but that's just the beginning. The bugs evolve into people and some of the characters are really the bugs and it's all evolving so fast that you can't keep track of who's who (or want to). I really hate a suspense book that spends all it's time chasing around in circles. In this case it's swarming around in circles. Imagine the novel Cujo only with killer bees that morph into a vicious wife. I'm not making this up. I'm hitting the fast forward button every 5 minutes and nothing changes, it's just more ridiculous! <br />In the last chapter (I think it was the last chapter, my Walkman was getting low on batteries from the constant fast forwarding) Crichton has an Agatha Christy moment where he attempts to explain what's been going on for the last 12,000 pages. Thanks for that Michael, I was wondering about all those incredible loose ends and plot turns that one paragraph ties all together.  <br />Oh my God, is this book bad! Looking for a good summer read? Go read Cujo again. I least the bad dog doesn't turn in to a bad spouse.
B00004ST9Q|5|Enjoyable
6305907145|3|While Frances O'Connor's Fanny Price is not Jane Austen's Fanny Price, she is a delighful girl none the less. Actually, the film Fanny Price is much more likeable than Austen's character, who never could have carried a movie on her own, being too pious and self-effacing, and in my opinion, downright dull. &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is obviously not my favorite Austen! However, the book deserved better than the socio-political tract that the director was determined to make it into, with historcially inaccurate references to slavery, and a hint of lesbianism. The book was set at a time in British history where the slave trade had been outlawed for several years, and so it would have been impossible for Fanny to have seen a slave ship discharging slaves off of the coast of England. There was nothing in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, the book, to suggest in any way that Mary Crawford was bisexual, although I can accept a defense that the director was trying to portray her as an amoral woman who would try to seduce anyone just to see if she could do it.<br />To my way of thinking, the best part of the movie came when Fanny was ordered to return to her birth family by her uncle (a deliciously creepy turn by Harold Pinter). After living in the comparative luxury of Mansfield Park since she was a young girl, O'Connor's Fanny is repulsed by the squalid conditions she finds at her old home. Her father (who seems to take a more than slightly unfatherly interest in his lovely daughter)is a drunkard, and her mother is harried and slovenly. It was a stroke of brillance on the part of the director to have the same actress portray Fanny's mother and aunt, who were, after all, sisters.<br />Even though the movie is not Jane Austen, and the politics of the director are hardly subtle, I still think the movie is worth viewing, primarily for the performances of O'Connor and Pinter. I think if you just try to forget that it is an adaptation of a classic work of English literature you will find the movie to be much more enjoyable.ind the movie to be much more enjoyable.

B000BTGY1O|5|I'm glad I bought this through Amazon. The price was fair and the shipping prompt. Audrey Hepburn's glamor and grace are effortless. The movie is great and I'm glad to own it on dvd. There are hours of extra features that I haven't watched yet but any extra footage of Audrey is a big plus.
B00005JKHP|3|I actually worked on the visual effects crew for this movie and you would think that I would say nice things about it.  But to be honest it is slow and boring and does not capture the essence of the original TV show in any way whatsoever.  This director's cut version does fix a number of flaws in the original release that Robert Wise was uncomfortable with due to the lack of time.  I remember working 18 hour days on the visual effects for the last several months of production and we barely got everything done that I was assigned to do.  There is no question that this is a classic Star Trek, and this director's cut version is must-see for any diehard Trekkie - especially for the special features.  It's just that ultimately it is a long slow movie with endlessly drawn out special-effects with actors sitting there with their mouths open staring at visual effects or the very sexy new enterprise in its drydock.  Let's face it, the original TV show almost always had fight scenes, direct confrontation with weird alien creatures, and Kirk or someone had to have at least one love interest.  And hey, there were no red shirts to be expendable in this movie!  So as a movie it completely misses the mark in the whole Star Trek TV series canon in my mind.
1897299214|4|Drawing on his experiences while in North Korea the author has created a book that really gets a feel for what it's like in the last of the hard-core communist states. Things that wouldn't have raised an eyebrow in the days of the USSR stand out in this 21st century throwback of a failed economic model. The illustration is not overly realistic yet conveys a sense of place, including many of the landmarks of Pyongyang. Proof that you can find humor even in a giant labor camp (\\"those are volunteers, right?\\").

0385484518|4|TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE has been a little blinking light on the Best Seller List for so many months that I finally decided to surrender and see what all the enduring fuss was about.  Besides, I needed a quick read for an airplane flight.  Couldn't be that bad..........<br />But surprise!......in the nicest way.  This little recorded conversation between a sage, dying old teacher and a prominent sports writer distills almost everything I wish I had experienced with my father before he died.  We all have people that meant alot to us and died before we plumbed their souls.  Ah, but this little tome is not about dying; this book is about living and living completely and compassionately, embracing our emotions with gusto and sharing that zest with our fellow earth-dwellers.  There is so much joy that spills from Morrie's slowly failing mouth that humor is always present, even if caressed by tears.<br />This is not a Self Help Book.  This is a goldmine of lessons, of wisdom and of love.  No matter where you are in the life cycle, whether a child or an earnest teenager, a fast forward adult or a member of the golden years clique, this book should be required reading.  And since Morrie would not have us put too much emphasis on collecting &quot;things&quot;, give it to someone you love when you finish the stroll through this marvelous diary.

B004HWT6DO|5|\\"The Social Network\\" was an excellent movie, and this came as a surprise to no one that I know of.  It was written by Aaron Sorkin (\\"The West Wing\\", \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\") and directed by David Fincher (\\"Fight Club\\", \\"Zodiac\\").  It has a likable cast between the well known Jesse Eisenberg (\\"Zombieland\\") and Justin Timberlake (The current prince of pop music and part time actor of some quality), along with up and coming actors Armie Hammer jr. (who, from what I hear, is in the running to play Superman in the next film adaptation helmed by Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan), Andrew Garfield (who will be starring as Spiderman in that characters upcoming reboot), and Max Minghella (which will be good in several movies that currently have little hype, but for all I know might be good).     The movie has fast dialogue, characters exchange very smart punchy quips, and the props and sets emphasizing this speech pattern, having the central protagonist doodle during a deposition, barely giving any attention at all to the multi million dollar proceedings.  If anything the dialogue might be too fast, the initial scene doesn't start slow and build it starts at a run, and if you aren't used to the style, you'll have to get used to the style or be left behind in the movies strongest character building set ups.     Considering the movie is about a gifted nerd being swept up into a culture of money-beyond-your-wildest-dreams, the film actually is very reminiscent of \\"Almost Famous\\", covering a similar time frame, but having an extremely different resolution (SPOILER: he remains a jerk at the end of the movie).  It also evokes Doctor Greg House of the TV show \\"House M.D.\\" as Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as obviously thinking on a higher level, and being rendered so lonely by his considerable intellect that he clings to it as his identity.  He seems to care little for money, and really just wants to be the smartest guy in the room, even when he becomes rich-beyond-your-wildest-dreams he sits alone and continues to construct some massive social directory (the one you are viewing this note on currently), unable to connect with those around him and clinging again to the veneer of aloof arrogance that shields him from the world.     This movie's strongest selling point is the fact that it has no antagonist.  It has one central character, Mark, and numerous tertiary protagonists that are all working toward their own ends frequently bumping heads as they go, al of the characters are complex and sympathetic, even though half of them are entitled millionaires and the other half is misanthropic nerds.  You feel bad for the Wicklevoss twins who had their idea stolen, limited as their initial vision was, and to see that idea go on to make billions is frustrating; maybe this sympathy is due to Armie Hammer's performance as the two brothers (very elaborate split screen was used), and he is just a likeable presence, but I really liked their scenes, especially when they get royally dismissed and screwed over by the Harvard President.     With effective direction, a strong cast, and a fast script I give \\"The Social Network\\" 4.5 stars out of 5.  (Go watch it, as I imagine that my being a little sleepy was the only reason it is not a 5 out of 5, and it was hard to get my mind into gear for the dialogue speed till about 5 minutes in).     (And yes, part of my enjoyment of this movie is that I am both a blond, tall, and slightly entitled guy, and a misanthropic nerd who would wear flip flops and a bath robe to a business meeting.  But I don't think that should reflect on my ability to evaluate this movie).

B00005JLSE|2|Honestly now... with the exception of ALL THAT JAZZ, I think if you've seen one Bob Fosse movie musical...you've just about seen them all. They're all simply reduced to a form of soft porn. That's it. And its worse now -- there's no more real dancers. Performers yes. Standing in the middle of the screen and shaking their booty and spreading their legs, well...you can see that at your local topless bar. Where are the new Ann Reinkings or Tommy Tunes? It would have been great if this movie was made 10 years ago and a younger Christopher Walken was allowed to play the lawyer part. Now he's a dancer. A dancer that could have lit a fire to that tap dancing number; as opposed to Richard Gere &quot;simulating&quot; a few tap dance steps. (I think the use of a gerbil could have helped him in that number). And can you remember any knock-out tune from this musical? I doubt it. Yeah, I'm rough on this flick. It's a dance musical -- with celebrities &quot;moving around&quot; as if they're a bunch of kids playing make-believe to a recording; though as adults, they're able to spice it up some by showing a bit of T&amp;A. No thanks. They're lowering the bar again. Lets get some real talent back up there, eh? We already lost story-line and drama flicks to FX; now we've lost dance musicals to celebrities. It's sad. Really sad, and I'm very disappointed.
B003ODL004|5|One of Hans Zimmer's greatest. All the thought and complex material that came from Christopher Nolan's head can be perceived through rewatches and through the soundtrack. It is so interlocked with the sound effects and story of the movie, one can only listen again and again as they try to puzzle out the movie.
B001LRJH0U|2|[[ASIN:B001LRJH0U Appaloosa]]  I wanted to view an exciting western, but found this to be very disappointing.  The acting was okay, but I didn't like the plot.
0812550706|5|This is a classic of science fiction. The concept of a &quot;Battle Room&quot; is a brilliant and well-thought one. It's one of those books that you can open up to any point, start reading, and find yourself absorbed for hours.<br />I don't think I've every met anyone who dislike this book. Just buy it and read it and enjoy it. Even non-SF fans will enjoy it. Interesting, complex characters, great dialogue, great ideas...what all novels should be.
B009UNGYHG|3|It's a great headset it but its hard to stay Bluetooth to your phone.
B008Y7N7JW|4|I read the series and wondered how true it would be to the first book which I enjoyed.  It is about as close to the book as you can get.  It captures the some of the ambiguity but also the moral mess that the &#34;hunger games&#34; were based on.  Definitely recommend this movie.
0525478817|3|I think John Green is a great person. He's funny and so thoughtful. But I get so frustrated by his book reviews! Before TFIOS even came out, the review page was injected with 5 stars and squeals of delight in the comments. It's just so disingenuous and frankly disrespectful to the integrity of the reviewing process. Even now that the book has come out, there's an intense inflation of 5 star reviews. I am glad John Green is so loved. I am glad John Green is getting people to read and think thoughtfully about literature. Nevertheless, I can not contain my annoyance: this book is over-rated.<br /><br />I remember hearing John Green mention that one criticism he gets a lot is that he's derivative of himself, and he didn't really think that was much of an insult. I thought, good, because that's exactly how I feel. Supposing John Green would wade through the 109384204 reviews on this site I wouldn't want to offend the guy.<br /><br />Really, man: awkward teen boy with odd quirk (featured alongside wacky best friend) falls for interesting yet elusive or otherwise unavailable girl. I honestly don't remember anything about An Abundance of Katherines except the main character's name was Colin and he was a prodigy. The only thing that distinguishes any of his main characters is their \\"quirk\\": quotes of dead people, etc.<br /><br />So needless to say, I was excited for the different-ness of the TFIOS premise. For that, it is my favorite of the John Green books. Still, as you can see from my rating, it was not perfect:<br /><br />1. Extremely flat characters. This was almost underlined in TFIOS, because in his previous books, the love interest was purposefully 2D, and of course many main characters feel flat. In TFIOS, the excuses ran out and it was just a series of characters distinguishable only in name.<br /><br />2. The over-injection of \\"like\\" into teen dialogue. Sure, a lot of what the kids say is unrealistic, but that is furthered by the saturation of the word \\"like.\\" NowI use like more than your average person, but this is borderline ridiculous. I understand maybe in the 90s or whenever John Green was a teenager maybe this is how kids talked. I don't think this holds true today.<br /><br />3. Storyline painfully predictable.<br /><br />4. Being repeatedly smacked over the head with the deeper meaning and take away messages. First it's hinted at and you get it, and you're like hey that's cool. Then it just keeps being shoved at you until you're told point-blank. Can we tone that down a few notches? I wanna read and find the symbolism and feel kinda smart for catching on, you know? It feels preachy. John Green is incredibly thoughtful and has some interesting perspectives that come off great in a 3 and a half minute video, but it's a bit much for a novel. If my memory serves me right, he may be getting better at this though.<br /><br />I think that's the crux of it really. John Green has an idea and he wants to give it to you and that's what his books are about. His characters are simply vessels to convey the message. To his credit, I think he tries to make his characters distinguishable (as seen by their interesting quirks), but it just doesn't make them feel real. We as readers want them to feel real. We want a story with an exciting plot. John Green wants to convey his thoughts on a certain idea through the medium of novel.<br /><br />John Green's characters do not inspire feelings or emotional connection; at best it is intellectual connection, but too obvious. You don't feel a fondness for them as you would the brazen Scout of To Kill a Mockingbird. Your heart does not rend in pity for them like poor Holden Caufield. Slaughterhouse Five for me was intellectually stimulating more than anything else, but since it was so intriguing and subtle I think that's what distinguishes it positively from John Green who has a very straight-forward and underlined POINT. I don't mean to sound pretentious with my references, but to me John Greenis much more comparable with those than Harry Potter or Hunger Games, you know? His inspiration and drive is idea rather than epic story.<br /><br />I don't know. I do know I can't really critique helpfully or intelligently. What I know is my gut reactions as a reader, how I feel. And I felt ok. Ok, it was kinda fun. It passed the time.<br /><br />What did I like about John Green's book? John Green does a fantastic job naming. Interesting-but-normal-but-have-purpose names. Also, I did like the thoughtful bits in his book, I just didn't like when it became way too apparent what he was trying to say.<br /><br />tl;dr: I recommend this book for a Saturday afternoon.
B00BAXFAJC|4|A good story that could have been told in 400 pages..only finished because of my Bookclub. Interesting levels of personsal<br /> Engagements and celestial signs, but come on..800 pages!
0345528581|5|I'm a serious athlete and after using this book for the past year and half, I can say with confidence that these workouts will build fitness in ways that make you feel stupid for ever trying anything else. Get this now!
1250012570|5|To be honest, I had low hopes for this simplistic story line -- however, once begun, I could not put it down. Like a teenager, I gorged on it in bed every night with a flashlight until I turned the last page. It captures the essence of teenage true love.  You get to re-feel all of the desperation and urgency and the mind-blowing good parts.  Anyone who was in love in high school will relate on an intimate level and thanks to Rainbow Rowell, can now vividly remember those hormone-charged, over-the-top, electric feelings. Bravo!
034580404X|5|Arrived timely in great condition & the books themselves are a great, enticing, inspiring read!<br />I truly hope a movie is to follow, even if it goes straight to video!
B00GJT20YA|5|I've been listening to this regularly since it first dropped.  It hasn't lost any of the original punch, which is my definition of art.  The songs are all fun, weird, and up beat.  Les Claypool is a genius, and he hasn't lost anything striking out on his own and trying new genera (albeit with a twist of Primus and Tennessee).
B009ZQI2GE|5|Awesome must watch sea venture!

B000069KGM|5|I'm thrilled to finally get this classic debut album by Chicago on CD, the double vinyl album now on a single disc. Thankfully, nothing has been chopped up or edited, so fans of the original LP will hear what they remember ... and love. Yes, this was back before the wimpy ballad era, back when the guys in Chicago daringly, and thrilingly, mixed rock and jazz and pop and even psychedelia to create an intoxicating musical brew. This album is all over the place, which I love. You get the hits such as \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\\" ... \\"Beginnings\\" ... \\"Question 67 And 68\\", plus some Hendrix-like jamming by Terry Cath on \\"Free Form Guitar,\\" a great cover of \\"I'm A Man,\\" and the uplifting \\"Prologue.\\" Hard to imagine a band being allowed such freedom to create an album like this nowadays. This is one to savor.
0345803485|5|I ordered this book for my son who has nothing to do right now and is reading his time by. He says it was good and would recommend it.

B0032FPVKE|3|I'm sure there are better bags out there for basically the same price. This bag is ok but I'm not all that impressed with the storage design and also it has a double zipper for the main storage flap and one of the zippers doesn't work. The bag seems to have ok material but not quiet enough room for my needs.

0316204366|5|Man oh man, read some of the one star reviews and you'll see what happens when you write about things like forgiveness, God and other biblical things.<br />I enjoyed Gladwell's other books, but I had no idea he had any biblical background. With all the science and humanistic views, I assumed him to be another atheistic Einstein or Sagan.<br />It is refreshing to hear stories that cast a shadow on all the confused social crusades we have been conducting for the past few decades.<br />As he points out, the ideas seemed good at first, but without the correct focus in seeing ahead, the results have the opposite outcome, such as in classrooms and jails.<br />Great insight into some of our recent history too and how we can move forward with discretion and proper determination,<br />rather than getting locked into logical 'religious' programs that ultimately destroy progress and end up causing more problems.<br />It shows that getting too 'liberal' in society is as bad as all out, mindless 'conservative' justice and uniform punishment,<br />all when done outside of love.<br />Gladwell shows that love is always triumphant, whether it is how students are loved, criminals are loved or the enemies who have invaded your country are loved.<br />If your are full of hatred, revenge, are  unforgiving and Godless falling for every seemingly logical idea that some deceived individual committee or group puts forward,<br />because it sounds good for all humanity, you won't like this book.<br />But if you are interested in human stories which prove that thoughtful love can champion over mindless or organized aggression,<br />you might just cheer for the underdog here and read this book. (Or listen to Malcolm read it himself on Audible).
B00AJRQLTI|5|I am not usually a musical buff but this was amazing. I had to buy the soundtrack as soon as I came home from watching the movie!

B00003CX8Y|5|AUGUST 26, 2005: I have the original Black Diamond Classics edition of this movie and the Platinum edition of this movie both on VHS. I am KICKING myself for not buying the DVD platinum edition! I got the VHS of the platinum edition just three weeks before my family got a DVD player (a month before I got one in my room)! Just to think that I could have the original \\"Black Diamond\\" version, the Platinum Version, AND a \\"Work-in-progress\\" version ALL on one disc is crazy! Too bad this DVD is out of print. I wish that they wouldn't make the platinum editions go out of print. I was lucky enough to find a used verion of the Platinum \\"Snow White\\" for $16.99 at game stop (2-disc). I really want this DVD version with all 3 versions of the film. By the way, \\"Human Again\\" has outstanding color and animation, not to mention, it is seamlessly added into the film, which I found amazing! Go buy this DVD NOW (hopefully I'll find it somewhere!)    EDIT: AUGUST 4, 2006: I found this on DVD, and I must say, I am very pleased! Disney really did well on this! \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" 's next release will be sometime in 2012.

B00003CXAA|5|Everyone thinks that I am just a little bit odd when they find out that I am into Mafia movies. I do not care about that, however. I know what I like and I like these movies. They really show you what being in the mafia is like and how dangerous it is. I could sit and watch them over and over again. You do not feel cheated when you watch these movies.

B0086449YA|4|anything from MK is good. so no need for me to ponder. I would endorse without any hesitancy. well done
B000062Y98|5|i recently received this album in the mail from amazon and its rendered me speechless. i havent been able to stop listening to \\"A Night At The Opera\\" for several days and counting! blind Guardian definetely didnt waste their time in the studio when they were making this, theres so much going on here that it can be overwhelming at first, but if you let it sink in, youll see how epic this album really is. \\"Precious Jerusalem\\" gets everything going with fast drumming, quick riffs, and a powerful chorus done with a choir. since then, the journey doesnt slow down until the bonus track, \\"Mies, Del Dolor\\", which features Hansi singing in a foreign language(Spanish?). however, as breathtaking and powerful this is, i dont think they quite got up to the majesty of their earlier release, \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\". that album just cant be beat, and trying to reach those heights once more is going to need more work, but this album is an awesome effort and worth your time.
B001EN71CW|5|I recently gave the original DVDs away to a friend who *gasp* had never seen the series. He liked it so much I told him to keep it and I would just get it on Blu-ray. Plays good. Nice sharp image and sound as one would expect from Blu-ray. My only complaint is the menu load times. I've clocked them at about 2 min to load the initial menu. I also pretty much hate the menu navigation. However, I do not see those two issues as being anything that gets in the way of the content.
B00821OX98|5|Interesting and entertaining. Smooth editing, good ideas within the plot, and good special effects. Recommended.
B00C7O8TSM|5|Although I attended one of these tour stops, it was great to relive the wonderful experience again. It is so inspiring to hear such enthusiasm and harmony from a group that has been around for over 50 years at a time when one year can be considered a career.
B00CKOYVG8|5|It helps me to relax. I have a lot of fun playing this game. Thank you for a great game.

B005ZOBNOI|4|Prepare for a sad book. I currently have a friend who has cancer, and it was very eye opening- but I wonder how factual a lot of the feelings in the book are- however I told her not to read it. I think it's a little intense if you have anything cancer related going on! On that note, it was a great read.
B009ZQC7MY|5|The best British series. Enjoyed every season. Sad ending to season 3, but I am sure  season 4 will make up for it.
B00DJFIMW6|4|I cant describe how much I love this game.  it keeps me on the edge of my seat and entertained.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that there really were no instructions to advise you that the main goal is to run over the other minions or slap them off the path as you run by them.
0307588335|5|I gave this book to my dad.<br />He hasn't finished reading it yet, but so far he is enjoying it.

B00C8S9W0G|4|I know it's a series but this one just abruptly ended.  Odd.
B00L9B7IKE|2|Following 3 strands of storyline, each written in first person, was a mental gymnastics of jumping back and forth.  I found it confusing at times to keep the whole plot going, until it finally braids together at the finish.

006202406X|1|Spiller alert: Veronica Roth got lazy with this last book. Throughout the series, Tris is flippant about death. However, in the last part of the second book and throughout the third book, Tris realizes she wants to live. It is then that Roth ruthlessly kills her. Not only does she kill Tris, but it is for no reason! Tris survives a serum and Roth murders her. She then devotes a measly 20 pages to the characters left behind in the aftermath. This book left me wanting a refund and will permanently cause me to avoid anything and everything written by Roth.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Fresh, entertaining.  High quality production, acting, and characters.  Looking forward to the start of season number 2 in April 2014
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This game is very addicting!!!! Flappy Wings is trying to kill me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Flappy Wings is the next best thing after flappy bird
B004EPZ07U|5|This movie is pure science fiction fantasy.  Right off the bat it tells us this by entering us into the story with some linear exposition.  Once it establishes this new \\"reality\\" it introduces us to the antagonists and protagonists quickly (the extended version here doing so a bit better than the theatrical version but not much is lost in the theatrical version).  The story is a trifle of one man being chosen to be a savior of sorts who essentially doesn't believe in himself but comes to believe in himself because he comes to believe in something more than himself (saving the world).  Standard stuff really.  What elevates this movie then?  For one, it is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The colors are deep and vibrant.  For another, it gives us unambiguous characters and an easy to follow story that makes it perfect popcorn fare (I realize that this is enough to significantly downgrade its ratings in a lot of people's eyes but shouldn't they know that they are getting a certain type of movie when they see the...oh, preview for this one?).  And for another, the \\"reality\\" in this film is sufficiently fascinating with plenty of supporting characters that can be explored.  Like many others I can't figure out why this movie got thrown under the bus when all of Marvel's fare enjoyed moderate success and decent critic review.  After seeing \\"X-men: First Class\\", \\"Thor\\", and \\"Captain America\\" I'd have to say that \\"Green Lantern\\" beats all of them out in my book (barely \\"Thor\\").  Sure X-men gave you some subtext and philosophical arguments to chew on and interlaced its story with our history (something the Cap film should have done a lot better) but the effects in X-men were less than stellar and the characters, while better drawn out than in Lantern, required that they be drawn out more.<br /><br />I will admit that I don't do the digital download/ ultraviolet copy things yet so, please, if that's your thing take a look at the one star reviews here.  They will be important to you.<br /><br />Lastly, I wanted to share one thing about this film that did bother me.  The \\"hero\\" of the story has looks, has a pretty adoring girl, has raw talent; in short, he's the supposed \\"dream\\" many want to be.  He's able to overcome his one flaw.  So, by the end of the story the \\"pretty person\\" gets everything and remains in their exalted status as said \\"pretty person\\" who is really pretty and now so much more.  By contrast you have one of the \\"villains\\" (played sympathetically and extremely well by Peter Sarsgaard--good job there) who is presented as a competent sad-sack.  He doesn't have the looks (poor balding guy), he doesn't have the pretty adoring girl (though said girl is kind to him), and his talent is capable but not superior.  He is not one of the \\"pretty people\\" (some might say \\"below average\\") but his heart, while sad at the recognition of loss of being able to get one of the \\"pretties\\", is also an honest and apparently decent heart at the beginning of the film.  He becomes infected by the uber-villain and undergoes transformations to his character and physical features that turn him into an extremely disgusting individual (inside and out).  Of course he dies.  So, by the end of the story the physically unattractive person loses everything and becomes so much less.  Doesn't this validate our Madison Avenue's view that the pretty are good and the ugly are bad (to put it simplistically)?  It sure did in this film and that's one thing I didn't like about the film.  And, there!  Who says this film can't cause a deep sociological discussion?<br /><br />Good film.stly, I wanted to share one thing about this film that did bother me.

0307476073|4|I wanted to read a book about hiking a long trail. I was open to the perspective this book presented - someone unexperienced with backpacking and the challenges their lack of experience and adequate preparation presented during the hike.  If one is looking for a book that presents the story of an expert and their well-prepared-for hike, this would not be the book for that reader.  But then, why would they bother reading it when It was pretty clear from the description what this was about?  This book is telling a unique story that is just as valid a subject to write and read about,  and is well written.  Others seemed bothered by the fact that they didn't &#34;like&#34; the writer due to her personal choices, mistakes and honesty about herself.  There are plenty of inspirational life stories to choose from if they don't want any of the hard edginess of life to read about.  Sometimes we want to be sheltered from the harshness of life and people's personality traits, and if so, then read a different book.  It would not be the fault of this book that they didn't find what they were looking for here.
B007UPDFBE|3|I found it difficult to get passed my dislike for the main characters.  Not one of my favorite from Fitzgerald.

B000BW7QWW|5|Joss Whedon is a god when it comes to story writing and character development.  Serenity like all his other works does not disappoint.  With all the action and visual splendor that the movie entices viewers with, the true essence of the film lies with its characters.  The world that Whedon beautifully illustrates is one that speaks of truth and companionship.  In a not so distant chinese/western-esqe world, in the end, its the people that are around us that make what we fight for everyday worthwhile.  This is no \\"star wars\\" epic, nor does it need to be.  The movie allows first time followers of this world to be quickly drawn in without dragging it out for those longtime faithful.  The extra dvd features are great as well, but honestly, buy this dvd and realize what TRUE writing and film making are all about.  Join the browncoats and keep this ship flying <br /> <br />\\"I am a leaf on the wind....watch how i soar\\"
B008BM9L72|3|Hot sexually but very badly written. But what can you expect for lady porn?
B000002I4S|5|John Coltrane spent years restlessly searching to perfect his craft (the strain of which eventually led to his untimely death), which is ironic as well as extra-tragic, considering his artistry was already perfectly presented here on _Giant Steps_, Trane's breakout recording as a leader. Although a huge jazz aficionado, I'm not particularly a huge Coltrane fan (only own three of his albums at the moment), but I would definitely rank _Giant Steps_ as one of the most enjoyable out of my collection.<br />As opposed to many of his later, more \\"arty\\" efforts, which largely reflect a sense of agonized striving, _Giant Steps_ overflows with nothing so much as exuberance and *fun*. Great tunes, great foot-tapping swing (Art Taylor: wonderful jazz drumming), great album. The only thing perhaps out of place is Tommy Flanagan on piano-he barely keeps up (particularly noticeably on the title tune). Where had McCoy Tyner been all Coltrane's life? The piano's not recorded too well, either-sounds kinda muffled. Wynton Kelly *nails* the piano solo on \\"Naima\\", though; definitely one of the finer moments on this top-flight album. Maybe he should have played on the rest of the tunes, too.<br />Very interesting are the alternate takes tacked onto the CD after the album proper, some of which are with different musicians from the ones on the original release, including a somewhat slower \\"Giant Steps\\" and extended-drum-solo version of \\"Countdown\\".
B000000993|5|As a progressive rock fan who entered Tool's world with Lateralus, I've been collecting their albums in reverse order. It's pretty strange going from Lateralus (their most progressive) to Opiate (their \\"simplest\\"). It must have been very interesting for fans who started at the beginning and watched this remarkable band grow into the powerhouses they are now.<br />At face value, Undertow seems simple and heavy, pulled down because of a muddy mix that never seems to raise the guitars above a buzz or Maynard James Keenan's voice to the heights where it should soar. It's more song-oriented than the multifaceted epics of Lateralus and even ::whoa!:: catchy at times. I love the rapid, quick-fingered picking of the infectious main riff for \\"Bottom\\". Heavy stuff can have hooks too, right?<br />At face value...<br />Undertow, however, is a pretty rich heavy metal album. Only traces of the alternative/grunge sound hover around Undertow's edges -- mainly the production style and some of the riffs. But in most respects, this is very much a metal record. Intellectually, however, Tool steps well beyond most metal bands with innovative musical intricacies and astute lyrics. Keenan is one of the most powerful vocalists in rock/metal, and his delivery is perfectly dramatic on songs like \\"Sober\\" (with its powerful ending) and \\"Crawl Away\\", where he whispers and roars. Adam Jones is a very unique guitarist, not playing conventional solos, and usually basing his playing on just a few chords per song. However, Tool is more about band interplay than individual playing: Danny Carey's exact and meticulous drumming; Paul d'Amour's gritty, growling bass; Jones' scratching guitar sounds, silent nuance, or earsplitting power chords. The title track is the most dynamic musically, with clever riffs and awesome vocals. \\"4 Degrees\\" shows the band's interest in Middle Eastern influences (which would inform parts of Lateralus). I recommend getting the lyrics from Tool's site and following along as you listen. It really gives the songs more impact.<br />And, of course, we expect a Tool album to have something weird on it. The trippy 16-minute \\"Disgustipated\\" finishes off the album, starting on track 10 and ending on track 69. Tracks 10-68 are just blank, 1-second bits. Then, on track 69, things start to happen. There's some dialogue, some sounds, some singing, and a *bit* of music. Listen closely to the words and think about it...interesting stuff.

B00002DE0S|1|I would have expected better interpretations from this pianist. This is not Chopin, but Mr.  Zimmerman's ego trip abusing two wonderful pieces. The excessive tempo variations are tasteless, mannered and painful to listen to.  Best among the many recordings is Argerich with Dutoit. Zimmerman probably could not find a conductor to go along with his exaggerated straining after effect, excessiveve rubatos and diminuendos.

0375869026|5|Wonder is a very happy, moving and sad story all in one. It made reading actually enjoyable for me.<br /><br />The story appeals to both young and old. It's about a ten year old boy, August, with severe facial deformities. August goes through some tough times. He has been home schooled until 5th grade so starting private school is one of his greatest challenges. Will kids like him or make fun of him? I can relate to starting a new school which is hard enough without the physical deformities that August had to deal with. He is a very likable, brave kid. With the love from his family and new friends he made it through the school year even though not everyone accepted him.<br /><br />I think everyone should read this book. It's a good reminder that looks aren't everything in a person, and we should treat each other how we want to be treated.<br /><br />T. Wilkins
B003V6L94Q|5|Absolutely awesome!!!!!!!! Songs are unique and typically \\"ZAC BROWN\\" style. Catchy, country-beachy-reggae sound that is so typical of this band. Songs you will sing every day in your head and take with you all through the day!!
B00DC7NNAC|3|James Franco acting and charisma carry much of this film.  Visually it can be stunning but at times the cgi is heavy handed.  What makes it interesting to watch is the development of the Wizard of Oz mythos.  If these are reasons to watch you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLEU|5|Finally!! An \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" for this generation, but this film has something for all age groups. Deliciously bizarre, but warm-hearted enough even for the fluffiest Disney fanatic!
B00008PW3Q|4|Like many, I was not expecting much from this album.  The group<BR>are about twenty years past their peak and it had been so long since Buckingham and Nicks were both in the FM lineup for a new studio album that I doubted they could ever recapture their earlier glory.  I thought it would sound like bland, middle-of-the-road VH1 pop/rock--but I must say, hearing this record was one of the biggest shocks I've had all year.  The key is Lindsey Buckingham, whose guitar playing and production skills are simply stunning.  First, his guitar playing: tracks like \\"Miranda\\", \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" and \\"Running Through The Garden\\" are very much in the classic Mac style, and<BR>the solo in \\"Murrow\\" is twice as good as that for \\"I'm So Afraid\\" (really!).  The intensity, the creativity, the signature sound is all there.  Then the production, with its experimental touches, reminds one of \\"Tusk\\"; he takes risks here that I would never have expected.  Finally, his songwriting is mostly <BR>first-rate, with the same energy and tunefulness that made \\"Go Your Own Way\\" or \\"Not That Funny\\" FM staples.  \\"Murrow\\", \\"Red Rover\\" and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" are classic songs.<br />Buckingham also greatly enhances Nicks' contributions, making them more interesting and convincing me that she should never again work with anyone else.  The two simply belong together.<BR>Although her solo work in the past fifteen years has been very iffy, she tries hard here and both her lyrics and vocals do not embarrass.  Particularly strong tracks include \\"Illume\\" (which could have been another soppy 9/11 tribute, but instead turns<BR>out firey and intense), the perfect pop song \\"Silver Girl\\", <BR>an old 70s outtake \\"Smile At You\\" (given another superb Buckingham arrangement) and the strong rocker \\"Everybody Finds Out\\".  The last two songs, Buckingham's \\"Say Goodbye\\" and Nicks'<BR>\\"Goodbye Baby\\", will bring a tear to your eye; the nostagia invoked in these two heartbreaking ballads is simply magical.<BR>Interestingly, two of the weakest tracks, \\"Peacekeeper\\" and \\"Say You Will\\" (both of which are the kind of bland VH1 pop I expected the album to sound like) have been selected for single<BR>and radio play--but don't let these fool you into thinking that's what the rest will sound like.<br />2003 marks the thirtieth anniversary of the release of the first \\"Buckingham/Nicks\\" album.  Now, with \\"Say You Will\\", the two have come full circle and created a work which ranks among the strongest of their careers.  What a delightful surprise.
B00CHI5B7A|4|Sin City overtones with cartoon excess. Maybe too much violence, but what else is new today. Sean Penn is over the top.
B001FB55MG|3|Bedtime Stories is almost really good.  In fact, it's almost really a lot of things.  For instance, it's almost really a good movie for kids and almost really funny. It's not quite good, funny, or a movie for kids, but it comes so darn close.<br /><br />Here is what works in Bedtime Stories:<br /><br />Bedtime Stories stars Adam Sandler, who is always likable though generally inane and crude as well. In this case, Sandler toned down the frat-house humor that so hollowed the movie Click.  He turns in his usual affable performance in Bedtime Stories.<br /><br />Russell Brand, who is charismatic though not very versatile, also comes on strong as Sandler's quirky friend.<br /><br />Richard Griffiths, a.k.a. Vernon Dursley of Harry Potter fame, and Courtney Cox also turn in a decent performances... but don't look for any of them to receive an Oscar any time soon.<br /><br />The storyline is great fun--Skeeter Bronson (Sandler) is lowly but talented schlep satisfied with a work-a-day job in a growing hotel.  His life is changed when he agrees to take in his sister's two children while she applies for work in another state.<br /><br />When Skeeter begins making up bedtime stories for the kids, he finds his inventions coming true in the real world.  A good premise.<br /><br />So why is Bedtime Stories only \\"almost\\" good?<br /><br />In the tradition of all things Sandler, Bedtime Stories falls back on tried and true silliness instead of trusting itself.  The movie includes a string of jokes about a hamster with over-sized eyes.  Fortunately, Disney, of course, stripped out the crude humor that so often shows up in Sandler movies.<br /><br />The additional cast.  I'm sorry but the formula Sandler and Keri Russell did not work.  They did not play off each other.  Sandler and Drew Barrymore had energy.  Sandler and Julie Bowen were great.  Sandler and Russell... not so much.<br /><br />In addition, Sandler has this pathological need to keep an entourage of auxiliary cast member--most notably and dependably bad would be Rob Schneider but there are others.<br /><br />In the end, Bedtime Stories is mildly fun and predictably happy.  For this movie, Disney has taken the edge off Sandler without giving him substance..    In the end, Bedtime Stories is mildly fun and predictably happy.

B000V39KDO|1|I love action and fighting movies and history.  I was excited that a movie was being made about Battle of Thermopylae.  I thought this movie had a chance to be great.  The slow-mo and fantasy aspect to me was less thrilling than a more realistic movie.
B00J3AW23G|2|The game itself is nicely made. It is simple, colorful, didn't require a ton of space, and I enjoyed the levels without a sense of pressure. I also appreciate the lack of invasive permissions.<br /><br />However, I ended up uninstalling after 8 levels due to an incredibly annoying pop up ad that occurs every few levels asking for a rating. After the fourth occurrence, I lost all interest in the game. It is a shame and needs to be fixed.

0615782043|4|To be honest, I was pretty certain that I was not going to like this book. One, I'm not a fan of poetry and two, the title alone, threw me off. But, I decided to give it a shot and figure out what the hype was all about. Surprisingly, it's a very well written book. It's only about 60 pages, so fairly quick to read. I would say it contains about 20 poems. The poetry is exquisite and breath-taking. The amount of detail that is laced along each and every line is incredible. During some points, I felt like I was watching a movie instead of reading a poem.<br />All of the poems are fun and erotic but the language is not offensive at all. It's actually very calm but sexy at the same time. It's a short collection of wonderful and sensual poetry; its hard not to love. This is a skillfully written piece of literature. Well done, GPA!! I highly recommend this book for all lovers out there.

B004K4AVAG|4|Born This Way is an odd record that blends elements of dance music, gothic pop, arena rock, and even a touch of metal but never fully inhabits any of those genres. It's Lady Gaga's way of announcing she was born to be a loud, garish, genre-bending machine, and her Little Monsters were (hopefully) born to ride beside her. Where image means as much as sound, the purposely tacky cover art confirms this statement. She's neither as Bruce Springsteen nor as Whitney Houston as she may claim to be, but she's certainly a unique pop personality who nearly converts appropriation into originality. Could another modern pop star give us an album where feel-good anthems like \\"The Edge of Glory\\" and \\"Hair\\" sit nicely among weird club forays like \\"Scheisse\\" and \\"Government Hooker?\\" Although the standard edition clocks in at just over an hour, barely longer than The Fame, it feels much longer, because this is a record that is defined by its relentlessness. In an era where hype means more than music, Born This Way is still one of the most interesting albums, and Lady Gaga continues to grow more interesting as she inhabits fame.
0307454541|4|Seldom does one get introduced to a character as compelling as Lisbeth Salander, a twenty-four-year old social misfit, and private investigator for a security firm, of extraordinary strength, resourcefulness, and capability. The root of her childhood trauma is never quite clear, but she has been under the protection of the state since her teenage years because of her reclusive, anti-social, and indifferent behavior and the convenient diagnosis of retardation. What she is, is a computer hacker extraordinaire with a penchant for detail and memory that is way off the charts. She is small - maybe ninety pounds soaking wet - but her whole punk motif - clothes, body piercings, tattoos, etc - is a warning, well heeded, of inner toughness. Early in the book, her guardian, supposedly her protector, discovers that the payback for crossing the line with Lisbeth can be ruthless.<br /><br />Carl Blomkist is a financial journalist for the leftist magazine Millennium, but his conviction for libeling a Swedish capitalist Hans Wennerstrom has put both his and the magazine's future in considerable jeopardy. He knows that he must leave the magazine for some period of time. But Blomkist's predicament is an opportunity for Henrik Vanger, an aging, retired head of a vast Swedish business empire, to renew his forty year obsession with unraveling the mystery of the disappearance of his brother's grand-daughter Harriet from the family's remote island compound. As Blomkist later discovers, it is Salander who does an amazingly detailed background check on him before he is hired by Henrik. As Blomkist burrows down into the evidence maintained all these years, as well as grasping the extent of the dysfunctionality of the entire Vanger clan, he realizes he needs a research assistant. Who's better than Lisbeth Salander?<br /><br />Forty-something Blomkist is a nice guy: friendly, capable, and open-minded. He's been in an open relationship with his married co-publisher Erika Berger for twenty years, which gets sorely tested when he moves from Stockholm for the foreseeable future to conduct his investigation. That affability is needed in his dealings with the antagonistic Vanger's. He and Lisbeth, in sifting through old photographs, newspaper articles, and even references to Biblical passages, finally start to make inroads on a case thought to be unsolvable, much to the consternation of some. Blomkist's understated charm does not go unnoticed by Cecilia Vanger, as she openly seduces him. More surprising and complex is the edgy relationship of Lisbeth and Michael, which tests her distrust of men.<br /><br />The pace of the book is good and the story lines of Harriet's disappearance, the fortunes of Millennium, and the potential for finally nailing Wennerstrom are interesting. But Lisbeth and Michael make the book. The atmospherics of the Swedish island landscape with its perpetual darkness and cold lend a sense of foreboding. Some aspects are a little wearisome. The many Swedish names and terms can be difficult. And the author has a fondness for telling the reader about every pot of coffee made and consumed. In what may be called \\"bonus coverage,\\" a rather intricate scheme to incriminate Wennerstrom is somewhat mechanically tacked on to the end. The book leaves the reader wanting to know what the future holds for Michael and Lisbeth.rely tested when he moves from Stockholm for the foreseeable future to conduct his investigation.

B004DLPXAO|3|I like having the kindle on my android, but I prefer the kindle itself better.  The Android kindle has only a couple of books on it, whereas my regular kindle has hundreds on it.

B00F88U4J6|5|Brilliant book reader with all the right features.
0956010903|1|How can she be ok with her name on a book that has at least 3 typos in it?  My outside book has an extra glob of glue on the front dark brown part along with some other line mark, and the inside velvet pouch has a couple of spots of something that stained it (water, glue?).  If I hadn't paid $100, who cares, but all of these imperfections do not equal a \\"collector's edition\\", which is what I was told I was purchasing.  The quality control was obviously abysmal, perhaps in the rush to capitalize on Amazon's purchase and the upcoming holiday spending season. I think Amazon should reprint this and re-send it to everyone who spent $100 and was promised a Collector's Edition, and JK Rowling should also insist since it's her name on it.  I think I'm going to just return mine.
0060987464|5|Naturally, since I'm a huge Manson fan I'm going to say that this book is great. It truly is. He writes very convincingly {though I wonder if all of it is true...} and after you read it you realize that he is a human being just like all of us. Also, don't be freaked out by the cover. It is an old saying that books shouldn't be judged by their covers and this is true. The book goes by quickly once you start reading it and it is a little expensive but it is an excellent buy that you won't regret.
B007SYWFRM|3|Didn't play it very long...
B003QS9VYE|5|An all time classic that my 2 year old has fallen in love with too.

B003O86FMW|5|I read the 1st book Hunger games, and someone suggested I read all three.  This 2nd book did not disappoint me, In fact, I had to hurry and buy 3rd book MockingJay.<br /><br />Now a fan of this series.
B007XUMHQK|4|I have to say up front, this IS good music. No doubt. I found it pleasant listening. There is some great piano work on here. I also like Dave Friebergs vocals. The guitar playing is minimalist and basically just coloring for the background. There are some decent songs, especially the first and last. Holy Moly and Joseph’s Coat also aren’t bad.<br /><br />The thing about this album is that when I saw Quicksilver on the cover, that’s what I expected. However, outside of the first song, Shady Grove, there’s not another song on there that sounds remotely like the original band. It’s the same old sad story for me. It seemed to happened to lots of bands from that era. They’d put out a couple of albums, the whole point of attraction for me in the first place. Then they’d either get bored, burned out, or for some other reason, suddenly shift directions midstream and become a completely different band. That’s exactly what happened to Blue Cheer to name one. I could name others but…<br /><br />It’s not like they stopped making good music, but they stopped making music that interested me. When a band does such a killer album like Happy Trails and then goes off the rails with something like this, well… the contrast is just too great. Plus, when such a great guitarist like John Cippolina is relegated to background texture and is overwhelmed by piano on the entire album, that comes as a shock. If I’d picked this up when it came out, I might have given up on the band. I’m glad I didn’t.<br /><br />I’ve never heard the album until a week ago. I got this for Christmas 2014. I’ve always wanted to fill in the gap in my Quicksilver collection. I picked up with Just For Love and What About Me after Duncan and Valenti rejoined and liked them despite Valenti’s vocals. On Shady Grove, it seemed like Cippolina phoned in his performance. The piano of Hopkins was so dominant that I consider this more his solo record than a Quicksilver album.<br /><br />Does this mean I hate it? Of course not! I may sound overcritical, but I actually DO like it. It’s a great piano album, though I’m not crazy about the country twang on many of the songs. There’s still enough good music for an easy listen as long as I forget it’s a Quicksilver album. I can still enjoy it without that monkey on my back.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a good listen and I’d recommend it on its own merit.his mean I hate it? Of course not!

B00003CXFV|5|The year of 2000 belonged to Steven Soderbergh, directing two of the year's best films, this and &quot;Traffic&quot; (the year's BEST). &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; partially served as a foreshadowing of &quot;Traffic&quot; through its vivid and bumptious style, utilizing different color tints and handheld cinematography. However, its main glory is obvious: Julia Roberts. <br />  <br /> With her impudent, dauntless and saucy performance, the character of Erin Brockovich perfectly mirrored Soderbergh's style of filmmaking. Susannah Grant's screenplay contained impeccable lines to quote, ranging from, &quot;They're called boobs, Ed,&quot; to, &quot;Bite my ass, Krispy Kreme.&quot; Roberts pulled it off graciously and unflinchingly, finally winning the Oscar on her third try. <br />  <br /> And, while there may or may not have been a boost in sales of actual Krispy Kremes from that now-famous quotation, the true Krispy Kreme of the film is certainly Roberts, without whom Soderbergh's film would have been bland, tedious and ultimately unmakeable, although Soderbergh could certainly have come up with another brilliant film on the flip of a dime. <br />  <br /> The point is, Krispy Kremes have new meaning, and as such, Julia Roberts can tell anyone to bite her ass.

B000QFW7UA|5|At last I can watch this movie, which is indeed very entertaining. Back in 80's when I played The Goonies game on my NES, I really enjoy this game. The background music and the story are very memorable. But I never have chance to watch the movie. I know it would be great, but this movie never been played in my country.  When I saw this blu-ray gift set on Amazon, I didn't take a long time to order it. Though it takes 1 month to delivered, I really excited. This great film with gift set box are wonderful.  Goonies never say die!
B00QW8TYWO|5|Great to pass the time.  Challenging too!
B007SGLZP8|2|I would definitely not recommend this J. Grisham book to anyone. I have been a fan of his books for years and this is not up to his usual caliber.  It's as if someone else wrote it ( someone who doesn't have anything constructive to say).  There is no redeeming social value to the protagonist's actions and if this is what I am to expect from future Grisham novels, then I won't be reading them.  K. Schoenhals
B00BEIYMAG|5|Love this movie and came just as expected.
B00QXL7MC4|5|Great harmonies and a very relaxing break from all the current pop music.
B000001FZK|5|Talk Talk were dropped by EMI after a row over their previous album, the equally brilliant SPIRIT OF EDEN.  They turned to Polydor's jazz label, Verve, to release their final album, but executives on the label must have despaired when they realised they had acquired some of the most uncommercial music ever recorded by a rock band.  The album was deleted within three months!<br />Fortunately another label has stepped in to rescue this extraordinary piece.  Talk Talk had already entered into studio lore for spending a long and expensive day recording a large brass section, keeping only the sound of a trumpeter clearing spit from his mouthpiece.<br />This is dark music, set to Mark Hollis's lyrics about sin and redemption.  I don't bother too much with words personally -- Hollis never makes it very easy for us to follow what his fragile voice is singing about.  The music is simply tremendous: spiritual, improvisatory, overflowing with ideas.  This is Hollis's LOVE SUPREME.  It is in the same vein, but in my view much better, than Radiohead's KID A.
B00QW8TYWO|4|Best thing ever
B008L5G4I8|4|I loved this mystery.  I love all of Agatha Christi's books, but I really enjoy her little detective Poirot.  The different facets of his personalty and the way his little gray cells always discover the culprit.  This mystery though I think is one of her best.
B0050DIWFC|5|I admit it took me a while to get going on this novel. Once I started, I found it amazing on many levels! Landay did a nice job of foreshadowing, but not spoiling the end. The Barber family is a believable All-American family. I could feel their pain, joy, and love! I kept trying to predict the possible ending, and yet ended up surprised!

0143034901|5|This is one of the few books I've read that I hope is made into a movie. It was a little confusing at points and I think a visual production would add a lot of clarity to this great story. The characters were endearing -  I would love to see who would play Daniel. Maybe Al Pachino as Fumero and that guy w/the huge nose from 'the piano' as Fermin (I think he won an oscar?)? At any rate, it's a great story and definitely worth reading.

B00RLK35ZE|5|I don't normally write reviews but had to for this one. I love this series! The beautiful cinematography & costumes, the Scottish history, even the details from table to stables. Each cast member brings depth to their character. The chemistry between Jamie and Claire is amazing. Kudos to Sam & Caitriona! I had not read the books before seeing the series, but the preseason previews caught my interest. I started reading the book by the third episode. It was nice to have a visual of what the characters looked like. I was not disappointed with the characters cast. I am now on book three and impatiently waiting for April 4. I watched episodes on my DVR and am thrilled to now have the Blue-ray with all the extras (wish there were more). I've read some of the negative reviews and people are to quick to criticize about minor details such as eye-color, minor plot changes and porn (not even close) when they should be focusing on the original story line. The producers have done a good job of maintaining the story including the sex scenes with good taste. This series is far better than anything I've seen on tv in a long time. Keep up the good work. I'd rather see love making than all the lame reality shows and shows about drugs & Psychopaths.

Not caricatures.Lots of laughs.I fell of my chair when the girl told the last&quot; When I was at band camp&quot; story ! Hilarious !Chris Klein s  one of the best young actors to come along in a while.If U liked this, get  &quot; Election &quot;
B000V698WE|5|Excellent
0142001104|4|The \\"void\\", the \\"space\\" is there to enable creations of our own. It empowers us as activists, achievers. The book hands us tools, methods that will empower us in terms of our conceptions and actions. It reminds us that we are not subject to them , on the contrary we are masters and rulers of our perceptions and actions. It lays out basic and strong methods to raise ourselves upon our pre-conceptions about ourselves, about the being around us and create new ones that will serve us, benefit us and transcend our limitations. It reminds us the continous universe of possibilities that await to be chosen and to be created by \\"the creator\\". But it also reminds us the responsibility of this massive universe of possibilities. Each possibility will be missed unless the actor realizes it, recognizes it, acknowledges it and finally creates his own conditions of being.
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is very fun.
0062082353|2|I have read several of the current sniper books that have come out in the last six months. This book while interesting did not provide the detail nor develop any interest in the plot line like the other authors.
0380789019|5|Everyone's heard of someone devouring a book.  I call this the type of book that eats you.  It's complex enough to be really interesting and exciting, yet still easy and fun to read.  After I finished the book I was  haunted by the characters for weeks.  I'm using in my freshman English  classes now.  I can't wait to get their reactions.
B000FBFN1U|5|From start to finish this was an excellent book.  A lot of late nights reading it.  This is not the type of book I usually read, but I am hooked!
B000006NPY|5|This is an album that the pumpkins come out from behind thier hard rock shadow and give a performance of some of the most beautiful, touching and inspiring music yet recorded. ADORE is a smashing pumpkins album, if you  miss the rock feel, then you are not a pumpkins fan, you are a grunge fan,  and this album is not for all the grunge heads out there. If you buy this  album,listen to it without a closed mind and with very very open ears.
B006ID6NDQ|5|I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who like history. It gave you a sense of really knowing what happened in Germany and Russia during the Holocaust.
B000002JSN|5|Listening to this brings back so many memories from my college dorm years.<br />way too good.
B001THZAAI|5|Unexpectedly different.  Danny Boone's original script is refreshing, and clean to boot. If you don't understand French it's well worth having to read the subtitles.
B00DSO9RMC|5|Brilliant, as ever.
B0065GC0BA|5|Awesome read.Compelling to the end.
B00IID56FU|5|Very good read.  More than I expected with the memorial.  Would recommend for any individual who wants to learn more about how  we in the military think and our perspectives.
B00E8KLWB4|3|I enjoyed the finding object part of this game but then I found out you need to ask your friends for items in order to advance in the game. I would not recommend this game if, like me, you just want the hidden objects and don't want to go through asking for items on a social network and wait for energy to play. Until I got to a point where I could not proceed without asking for items I enjoyed the game. So basically if you just want to find items and go through a story without interaction this one isn't for you.. If you are looking for a good hidden object game to play with your friends this is a good one.
B005LN5UOC|4|YES its an amazing headset to buy. if your a gamer and want a nice headset with a great price this is the one to get. I bought this one as a back up too my other headset and I honestly use this one a lot more often then the other one i have. totally worth it
B000Z66RSS|5|I thought this CD was great. Really made me want to dance and I love to listen to it in the car.
B007A4SDCG|1|This book is highly recommended as a way to stop procrastinating and get down to work. It starts off ok, talking about \\"Resistance\\" and how it keeps us from being productive. So far, so good; I can relate. Then it meanders off into woo woo Weirdoville. He talks about Greek gods, and Muses, and reciting a prayer to these deities before starting to work. After doing a nice job of identifying the enemy (Resistance), and assuring us it can be defeated, he gives absolutely no practical advice for defeating it!<br /><br />Mr. Pressfield writes a lot about ancient Greece, and I respect his success. Unfortunately, all that research into ancient Greek culture seems to have permeated his brain. I suppose if he believes his success is because of the intercession of the Greek gods (or other imaginary friends), then good for him. But this is his advice to others for overcoming Resistance?<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
B005K17RU0|4|This app isn't good for keeping your location. It keeps moving me around town and I am sitting in my house. As for weather, it is a wonderful app. Always up-to-date with storm watches and warnings.
B00003XACV|5|A glimpse at the 70 or so reviews that have sprung up...  for this masterpiece gives some indication of how important Thomas Newman's score to the 1999 Sam Mendes tour de force has become. It was indeed a special film that required something extraordinary from its musical collaborator. Newman hits the spot with the ethereal soundtrack to our vision of a man who is clearly either losing it or learning to get it right, whichever way the viewer interprets Kevin Spacey's tragi-comic deviation from the life that is expected of him. The two principal themes of 'Dead Already' and 'American Beauty' are deeply moving and pass the test of standing alone, away from the images of the film. <br />Thomas Newman has managed to extend the tradition of exellence that is expected from such an outstanding musical dynasty. The Newman family sits at the heart of 20th Century American music, with its variety of messages displaying a quintessential American sound, from Alfred Newman's scores of the 1940's right up to the present day. Anybody approaching Thomas Newman's work here for the first time should take time to listen to his work on 'The Player' and 'Shawshank' as well as picking up cousin Randy Newman's outstanding orchestral soundtrack to 'The Natural'. <br />In summary, an exceptional piece of work that will justifiably stand the test of time as an 'American Beauty' in its own right.
B0031KC8OC|5|I can watch it over and over...
0399159347|2|There was so much emphasis on one character being fat, then losing weight. And then one character being too thin - but in an almost glorified way. And snarky comments here and there about body shapes that take away from an OK story. Who cares!!? Spend less time being vapid and more time on character development!
1451627289|3|A decent read up until the end where upon the whole thing falls apart with a quick, and cheap, ending.  Once again King's hero is a bit of an idiot as, after all, if you were going back 50+ years in the past wouldn't you want to see something more interesting than rural Texas? You've got four years to do what you came for and you don't visit New York or Paris? You can know who is going to win every major sporting event and the only bets you place are with a couple of shady bookies in Florida and Texas? How about going somewhere where betting is legal and winning your money there? Vegas? London bookmakers? How about putting a very large amount of Swiss Francs into a Geneva safe deposit box so that you can come back for it in 2011? But no, our \\"hero\\" decides to teach high school in some nowhere town outside of Dallas... Jeez.  Back to King's prose. Lot's of detail, many good characters with a \\"meh\\" intertwining of details about Lee Harvey Oswald's home life that, and you can see this a mile away, all comes down to the seconds before the Kennedy assassination. Okay up to this point but then there's a short and very unsatisfying resolution that makes the reader wonder why the heck they've bothered to spend so much time bothering to read this book.  Very disappointing.
B003JUGQ38|5|This is one of my favorite shows and I love that it is on prime! The Tenth doctor is one of my favorites and love to rewatch the seasons fron time to time!.
B000SGGUWS|5|This book was so amazing! But very confusing! I want to see what happens next! But if you read this book, understand that you're in for some high school drama, teen revenge, unfairness and confusion of charters and what happened to them
0575081406|5|one test of a books long term worth is its RE-readability.  Most avid readers have a small number of books they return to again and again. These books are like old friends. They have characters you want to keep alive. They have places you want to revisit again and again.  They have ideas that somehow spark your own imagination and thought. These books keep on giving, with every read giving you new insights, and new joys.     I have reread NOTW twice since its arrival in 2007, and i enjoyed it more with each subsequent read.  Its a wonderful tale, artfully told, and I anxiously await the arrival of the sequels....
B00CMDS1H2|5|This classic western is probably one of the best every made.  The storyline has a great flow and how can beat Lee Van Cleef as the bad guy!  Eli Wallach's character is a hoot and Clint is at his finest, so sit down on the couch and spend a little time viewing a great movie.
B008FSCNTK|3|Been a Diana Krall fan for a long time, but this is her worst album, IMHO. She needs to get back to some serious ivory tinkling.
0452282152|3|Girl with a Pearl is a lovely one evening read. A nice break in between the conspiracy theory novels. Don't rush this book, it ends much too soon. Interesting relationship dynamics. Purchase from a used book store, or you may want some of your money back.
B0000DD7NL|5|Lush. That's the best word to describe the sonic odyssey Ms. Keys takes you on this time. Her first album, the spectacular 'Songs in A Minor' held forth the promise of greater things to come, but who knew she'd deliver so quickly, so deeply... this record is yummy. This record is throw-a-log-on-the-fire-and-make-love-on-the-floor-of-every-room-in-the-house-all-weekend goodness. May the music gods be praised, someone, this someone, still writes SONGS. My choice for best album of 2003? Well, there's still under a month left to try to beat it.

B0000028UK|5|This rocks! Its the best. If you like Pearl Jam you either own this or should be ordering it right now. More fluid than Ten and less out there than Vitology or No Code this could, dare I say is there best album. From beginning to end you'll throw your head around and maybe other stuff too.
B009ITMPJI|5|The best film adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel ever made.  Robert DeNiro is almost unrecognizable as the creation of Dr. Frankensteln.
0385537131|5|Another great book from John Grisham. Worth the read. keeps you wondering about shat is going to happen.
B0086700CM|5|this game is really fun my friend is awesome at it and I am still trying to beat her high score
B00NZIIPBU|4|Not always stable and up to date!
1401322425|5|I am in love with this book -- the recipes are outstanding! Jamie has such a gift for creating unexpected, delicious combinations of ingredients -- I will never make another bbq sauce again without orange zest and orange juice.<br /><br />Not only are there fabulous recipes organized by season, there are some great gardening tips and resources, not to mention gorgeous photography and printmaking art.<br /><br />If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would!
1573220485|5|Alex Garland's &quot;The Beach&quot; conveys the mentality of a young traveler to a haunting degree of accuracy.  The protagonist experiences events with a laconic but barely definable attitude, as he continues on his journey without passion or purpose.  As a former back-packer myself, Garland stirs emotions and non-emotions in me I thought I had left behind
B001Q9J4PG|5|Wonderful story , well written ,Clancy sure hit the mark with this fun book.  Looking forward to the next one...
B00C9U9YOW|5|This may be their best album yet. I love how nice this flows together. A very good listen if you are a fan of any of their other work. Catch them on tour to be blown away!
B00881VLCE|5|Love that I can do over 200 piece puzzle and my kids can do smaller puzzles.  Plus you can pick out the boarder pieces.
0385340540|5|I really enjoyed this thriller.  It had a good mix of location, espionage, conspiracy and redemption in a lead character who started off as an egotist and by the novel's end realized his mistakes, worked to correct them and became a likeable character.  I thought the characters were well-developed and the location in Italy very interesting.  I read The Broker in one night and gave it to my daughter and she LOVED it as well.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Addictive game😄
B0026QC0TA|5|This movie is heartfelt, full of drama, but yet funny as well. Damon and DeVito make a great team. I could watch it over and over again.
B00KCOMBJC|5|Amazing
B006KX3GXO|2|THIS APP STOLE MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT I TRIED TO UPLOAD A PHOTO TO FACEBOOK AND THEN I LOGGED INTO MY FACEBOOK AND IT SAID IT WAS LOCKED BEECAUSE ANOTHER WEBSITE DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE FACEBOOK HAS DONE BLAH BLAH BLAH MORE BULL CRAP DONT HEY THIS APP IF YPU ARE GOONG TO USE IT FOR FACEBOOK
B00003CXCW|5|I watched this movie 10 years ago and I still get goosebumps!! William Holden is great as the down on his luck screenwriter.  I still get a kick out of Cecil B. DeMille in a cameo performance.  But Gloria Swanson is the reason you should watch this classic.  She should have recieved and Oscar for her larger than life performance.  Watch and be in awe!!
B00GTO6X0W|4|Although reminiscent of &#34;The Life of Pi&#34; and other lost at sea adventures I identified with the situations, dangers, and risk of sailing alone and the big chance of one of those &#34;never in a 1,000 chances&#34; occurrences. Who would have thought that a shipping container would smash into your boat? Redford presented himself a seasoned sailor without panic and a practical problem solver but the hopelessness of all going awry took its toll. I was relieved that he was rescued after he accepted his supposed fate.
B00JOT3HQ2|4|Very addicting and I suggest getting it... if you are willing to waist time out of your day. But all and all good game.
B00NGTAFD4|5|Fabulous music from a true artist, Annie Lennox.
B006LSZECO|5|I have to be honest. I did watch the movie before I read the book. So I knew what was going to happen. The book was better then the movie. Well that's pretty much true for all books turned into movies. I liked reading the book more because you get so much more detail than what the movie shows. I would definitely recommend people to read this book.
B00BP4ZNFM|5|Kids loved it. Graphics were fgoodforbeing an 80s movie
B00BUCW54Q|4|Very well thought out story, well executed scenes, more than a novel based movie, way better than typical action thrillers of its vintage.Wish more movie plots were planned as novels first, instead of on the set that day they were shot, as so many seem to be.
B00HAQCLNQ|4|Great story of collapse....from marriages and economies to Jasmine' s mental health. Leaves you wondering where the truth really hides.
B008MM9630|2|Very cute.  Also VERY frustrating!!  The game seems to have a glitch where time stops as soon as you exit!  I've payed it before a year or so ago and it did not do this.  What this means is that your crops don't grow, you can't harvest and thereby gain experience and by the time your crops do finish it's when most inconvenient for you (ie sleeping, working, etc.) so your crops wilt which means you need double the energy to recover them, but hey, too bad because time standing still means you don't collect any energy!!!  I even payed real money on it hoping that might somehow matter and fix the problem.  It did not!  HUGE LET DOWN!!  &amp;#62;:(
0425173755|4|I first read this book a half-century ago, and, in my youth, I was very impressed by it.  I've just read it again, having forgotten most of the details of the plot, and did not find it nearly as good as I had remembered.<br />The novel did not seem to be &quot;fleshed out.&quot;  The denouement was a bit too bizarre.  Poirot is just a trifle too facile in his logic.  The characters seem leftover from a dozen other works.<br />The British train was, for some reason, the perfect setting for a murder mystery and was employed many times for that purpose.  The Orient Express does provide an excellent backdrop for this study in murder, not entirely separate from the Lindbergh case that was the &quot;crime of the century&quot; when this was published.  The method of laying out the plot is quite good, if a little too thin.  Most books tend to be overwritten--&quot;too many words.&quot;  This one needed more, somehow. As I turned the last page I found that I just was not convinced that this could have happened.  And being convincing  is the key to the literary success of any work of fiction.
B007JM4CWY|4|Fun puzzle game. Nice for a change from other puzzle games like sudoku
B00APUQH0W|4|This film seems to echo much of my inner baseball geek's internal monologue.<br /><br />Though I tend to side with the Sabermetrically inclined, I do feel like there are some things that make players great that don't show up in a slash line, and this film humanizes this.<br /><br />Plus Clint Eastwood rules.
B005HF0BIE|4|Wow , I was impressed with the story line and history again. I love the clothing and make up in the series, they are very detailed. The only reason I did not give them five stars is because it's not so graphic as I would like things to be. Yes , I'm a little bit like that.
B003UAKE9Y|5|yes my grandkids loved it
B00NH13W2W|3|The lightning end of these cords DOES NOT fit into the slot of the Iphone 6 Otter box cover.
B00DYFCYSO|2|Its amazing how good All of Me is. the rest of this cd is awful, i mean truly hard to listen too. Doesnt even sound like the same man singing.
B008G3N71W|1|Thank goodness I got this for free. If I'd paid money for this degradation, I'd be horrified.<br />I love (LOVE) smutty romance. This is not that.<br />I read about 8 chapters before I couldn't take any more. In that time, the main character had submitted to being beaten, whipped, urinated on, and spit on.<br />I do not find humiliation erotic. If that's your thing- this is your book. But if it's not, don't waste your time or money.
B004JN1D2I|5|If you love the show, if you feel like you never can find a book that immerses your mind into the story, this is it. A Game of Thrones. More twists, side plots, love, death, and laughter that you can experience with others who are already reading it. The show is great, but if you want the details, buy it now!
B000FC2L1E|5|Another winner... sent me right back to Amazon for the next book. Claire and Jamie will take you on a wild ride.
B008IJTFYW|5|Love to use this as a sleep aid. It's soothing sounds are great. I especially like that I can overlap the sounds of my choice and adjust the volume of each sound as they overlap.  fantastic!
B0058YPGSY|5|it was awesome.i would recommend it. to everyone good show all to gether. can't wait for season five to come up for sale.
0792156684|2|The fact that this film won so many oscars really shows that effects triumph over acting. It was sickening to see James Cameron claiming to be 'King of the world'. This is a prime example of never judging a book by  it's cover. The whole story has nothing to do with the Titanic. It is  simply a glossed up cheesy love story,(and not a very believable one at  that)filled with equally unrealistic characters. <br />Leonardo di Caprio is  just plain irritating as the spritely young Jack. Leonardo di Caprio is  badly cast and as some people can't see he is a very bad actor. (The only  time he ever showed any talent was as Johnny Depp's handicapped brother in  'What's eating Gilbert Grape')winning his ticket in a game of poker as  young spritely lads so often do how predictable is that. He is truely a man  on the edge!  <br />And what was Kate Winslet thinking? She is such an  excellent actress (see Jude and Heavenly Creatures) her skills are totally  wasted as the poor little rich girl who finds 'freedom' when she meets  scruffy little Jack. Billy Zane is also not believable as the  villain.<br />Although the acting is bad a lot of it can be attributed to  atrocious screenwriting, a prime example being the scene where the ship is  sinking, people are plumetting into the water around Rose and Jack. And in  the middle of all this Rose turns to Jack and says:<br />&quot;Jack this is  where we first met!&quot; <br />Another scene is where an Irish woman is  telling her children about 'Tir na nOg' which epitomizes the daft  perception American filmmakers have about Irish people. Very few children  are told about Tir na nOg outside of a classroom in Ireland and sometimes  not even there. Enough said<br />This film insults rather than comemerates the  people who died. It tries to make you feel more sorry for characters that  didn't exist than the actual people who did drown eg. The Astars (owners of  Macy's) but of course we don't want to think of them because of course as  thisfilm's prejudice shows rich people are evil and mean except of course  Mrs Brown(Kathy Bates) but she wasn't always rich, her mind driven by the  importance of money (as this movie shows) as everyone else is.<br />Don't be  taken in by this forgettable film. It is a watch once and forget about it  kind of movie. The fact that it won as many oscars as Ben Hur is an insult.  Yet I guarantee Ben Hur will remain a classic long after Titanic is  confined to the archives
B007V4QMCI|5|This is a must have for any TLC fan.

B001KDQ4KQ|5|Very interesting book and kept me reading into the wee hours.  Teen suicide is a real issue and reading the thoughts of the teens involved gave me some insight into the problems teens face. I would recommend this, especially to parents of teens.
B000FC2L1Y|5|I am addicted to these books, they  remind me of Larry McMurtry  and  the &#34;Berrybenders&#34;,  I have to slow my reading down because I want the books to last....
B004GUSG4M|4|I liked this book! Though at times I did feel like it went on and on! Wished the ending didn't leave you hanging! I think this would make a great movie!
B0084IG8TM|5|This Movie was a great price and came with in 5 days me ordering it.  I recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />Thanks

B0041KKYBA|5|Inside Job is a documentary written and directed by Charles Ferguson, narrated by Matt Damon and starring Ronald Reagan, Alan Greenspan, Bill Clinton, Henry Paulson, Robert Rubin, and many others whose obsession with deregulation and whose regulatory failures led to the banking crisis and worldwide recession that began in 2008 with the bankruptcy of Lehman and AIG and the collapse of GM and Chrysler.    The movie dissects the origin and development of the mortgage bubble, it's meltdown and the resulting world recession which resulted in 30 million people losing their jobs. Like Michael Moore's documentaries, Inside Job is composed of ambush interviews, news clips and comments most of the key players who declined to be interviewed and by critics of banking practices and regulatory failures beginning with the Reagan administration and continuing until the world wide economic crash which began at the end of the Bush administration in 2008.     The documentary takes viewers step by step through the developments, beginning with deregulation debacle in the savings and loan industry under Reagan and continuing through subsequent administrations including, importantly, the repeal under Bill Clinton of the Glass-Steagall Act which had required the separation of banking and riskier securities trading activities since 1933. The elements leading to the housing bubble and the financial meltdown were deregulation of the banking industry, securitization of the mortgage industry through the creation of mortgage derivatives, excessive bank leverage creating excessive risk and failure of the bond rating houses to accurately assess the risk brought about by securitization of subprime mortgages.    The movie is similar to several of Michael Moore's movies such as \\"Wall Street, A Love Affair.\\" Inside Job's lack of Moore's humor is more than made up by the detail and clarity which it provides about the dogmatic faith in unregulated markets, abuses, growth and influence of Wall Street banking behemoths and how they have captured government economic and regulatory policy, including the recent weak regulatory bills signed by Barack Obama.    However, one of the most compelling and damning portions of the documentary is its expose of how the financial industry pays economists at top universities and graduate business schools to write articles expressing their viewpoints without disclosing the payments they get for the \\"research\\" and serving as directors of the companies. Larry Summers, former Clinton Treasury Secretary, Harvard President and chief Obama economic adviser has made millions consulting for hedge funds. The Dean of the Columbia Business School, former Bush chief economist, R. Glenn Hubbard, and Reagan economist Martin Feldstein came across as arrogant and defensive when pressed by the interviewer about their ties to Wall Street and their role in the rush to de-regulation and tax cuts for the richest Americans. John Campbell, chairman of Harvard's economics department and Glen Hubbard were reduced by the interviewer's questions \\"to stammering obfuscation,\\" to borrow a phrase from A.O. Scott's N.Y. Times review of the documentary.    The most discouraging conclusion of the documentary is it's demonstration of how seamlessly the the baton was passed from the Wall Street insiders and fanatical Friedmanite free market economists to Treasury Secretaries and de-regulators in the Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush administrations. And many of the same true believer captives of Wall Street were appointed by President Obama, belying and undermining his eloquent vows to reform the financial industry.    To borrow another phrase from A.O. Scott's review , the movie is \\"about a crime without punishment\\" and with millions of victims.    [...]
B00005KAQP|5|This is a great, happy, movie.  Great music, good story, Very uplifting, and wanted it for my collection, just to have.  As is sometimes the case, it's the best of the \\"Sister Act\\" movies in my opinion.  Get it...you won't be sorry.
1475143389|5|I have been seriously trying to lose weight for a little over a year know, we'll I thought I was serious about it. I had lost a little over 20lbs in 8 months or so when I started to read Bigger Leaner Stronger. After reading this book and putting the advise to use, I have lost a total of 53lbs. Eight months - 20lbs, 5 months of BLS diet and 5 days/wk of interval cardio - 33lbs.<br /><br />Bottom line, this stuff works. It's not too hard to follow the diet recommendations once you get the hang of it. The weight training is challenging, but not too hard to start at any level. I have recommended this book to everyone who asked me how I lost all the weight.
B008NMT684|1|Grandchildren love it when it works properly.  Screen constantly turns gray and the only way to fix it is to power off and start over.  If there is a fix  I'd love to know it.
B002PE0HCU|5|This movie is very well-directed and will keep you on the edge of your seat!!!  AND, if you only knew the background of the personal relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren.  You MUST look into THAT!!!  Pretty creepy-scary!

B0012GMW7A|4|I listened to Leonard Cohen in the old years and liked the poetry of his songs. Then i didn't listen to him for awhile. Recently, he came out with a reprise concert Live in London, which i loved. Call me sentimental, but Leonard singing Leonard at age 73 really touched me, as did the warm response of the audience. I decided to fill out my library of Leonard Cohen music. I just wasn't as thrilled with this album. Maybe it was the lack of a live audience or the specific lyrics here, but the LOVE just didn't come through for me. I'll try other Leonard Cohen CDs, though.
B00007KQA3|5|This must be not just the best, but the ONLY good film dramatization of Orwell's famous novel.  The visual style creates the atmosphere vividly.  John Hurt is genuinely moving as Winston.  Richard Burton is appropriately implacable as O'Brian.  It helps to be already familiar with the book--but if you're not, this is still a powerful story.
B00BD99JMW|4|Good read. I liked the first book best. I heard if u like hunger games you would like the divergent series too. Which I did but not as much. Just my option.
B002TYZKIM|5|I'm an old lady and like classical music but Michael won my heart and I have never seen anyone to dance and sing like him. It is so sad that he is gone so early, he was still so young and talented. I never believed all the stupid stories they spoke about him, He was a good man and he suffered a lot for all the lies and gossip. People is so envious and bad, they will do anything for money and he had a lot. Always helping others and getting more power for black people in general. Some don't know he used to go to the legislators to press them to accept laws for black people. Elizabeth Taylor was always defending him too. I will buy anything Michael, he left some institutions, that need our money, charitable institutions which we must keep and sustain because they were Michaels' charities. His family keeps them as long as we keep buying his dvds and cds; besides, they are worth looking at and hearing. I prefer dvds as I love to see him dance.

B00NG4K8UO|4|Con: It's too easy to accidentally drag into a gesture that deletes the word you're trying to type, and changing the gratitude length doesn't seem to help. I really wish there were a swipe mode that could be toggled.<br /><br />Pro: Easy to type fast, loads quickly, looks great. Autocorrect is fantastic.

0545140323|5|Penny is tired of boys, always cheating on her or treating her wrong, so she decides to created a club for the lonely people like her. Of course, she never thought so many girls would join her!<br /><br />Penny was such a great protagonist. I admit it, while reading the first chapter I thought I wasn't going to like her, but she manages to became one of my favorites ya protagonists. She actually matures and grows up to be an amazing girl.<br /><br />I couldn't believe some of the things that happened to her, as the principal's disrespect for her club and her or the people (like other girls) being mean to her. But in a way, it's very realistic. People is mean, and still exists people who don't accept girls have power (probably because they are scared). But I loved how Penny managed all of this with the help of her friends and parents.<br /><br />Penny and her family are fans of The Beatles, and the club's name is based on one of their songs. Personally, I love some of The Beatles songs, so I actually enjoyed the references and lyrics on the book. Besides, it was really cool and original for the author to find the perfect song for each chapter.<br /><br />Overall, I loved The Lonely Hearts Club. It's a quick, fun and light read, perfect for when you need a little bit of girl power!
B00004RF98|5|If you love the GE commercial of the Elephant dancing in the jungle, you will see the original in this movie.  I think it is Gene Kelly at his best and he was a pioneer (if that is an appropriate word for a dancer)in the casual dance.  Fred Astaire had always done \\"formal\\" dancing--tails and all, and Gene Kelly danced in sweaters and penny loafers. Enjoy this movie for the story as well as the music.

B003N0XDT4|5|My only complaints, are that sometimes the volume buttons don't react that quickly, and that I haven't noticed a large enough improvement to use this always strapped onto my ipod. I almost want the model down that has a simple knob for volume adjustment. This has wonderful battery life. The DAC works great, and I have begun only using the amplifier for that function with my computer, because with my low impedance headphones, I don't really benefit that much from using an amp rather than the built-in ipod one.

B000ICL3KG|4|This movie really gives a different view of Al Gore.  He's a smart guy who has a lot of passion around global warming.  I felt very motivated when I finished the movie, and also felt more understanding as to why he didn't win the presidency.  He simply is not as passionate about issues outside of the environment.  Lots of great data explained well in this film.

B007FG9LIE|4|Perhaps this series of novels will be more successful as a TV series than as literature. The TV version gave the first book in the series some much needed editing.  The development of the plot is incredibly slow, with too much narration and not enough dialog. Also (SPOILER ALERT) the basic premise of the book is absurd. It takes more than a village to create a new civilization. After the rest of the world has undergone reverse evolution in a post-apocalyptal adjustment, Wayward Pines still has a helicopter, automobiles, gasoline, electric power, modern healthcare, firearms and ammunition--with no indication of where they were obtained or how they are maintained.
B00000K31Q|5|When I first heard about this movie, it would be a fun movie, but mediocare. I was pleasantly surprised about it--the caracters were really well rounded with fun quirks that remind us of the cruelity of the social dynamics of high school and the movie was well written with hilarious and witty lines that fit into the context of the story that fit the caracters and went a step beyond the conventional lines. It was a well done modernazation of Taiming Of The Shrew.
B00008LDPU|5|Beyond is based on a glitch in the matrix.  These kids exploit the glitch and you see leaks of the reality and freeness of the matrix by their actions.  Also, agents are tracking the leaked area, and on the way to fix it and make the people forget what they saw. This girl also goes to save her cat.<BR>  <BR>Kid's Story is about a kid who cannot sleep, like Neo, and Neo sends him a message, in which causes a pursuit through his school to where he falls to his death-- in the matrix-- and is free'd into the real world through self-substantation(sp) he is also the Kid who wishes to carry neo's bags in Reloaded.  <br />I was quite glad to see the Animatrix, Enter the Matrix and Reloaded work with eachother to un cover the story of the 2nd movie.<BR>Also, this is definately worth the buy, i couldn't pull myself away when I saw them personally.  Ended up going to bed 2 hours after I really needed to.<br />Also, World Record is an incredably good story of this man who is aware of the matrix through his extreme abilties in his muscles, and lack of the Matrix to define his strength and speed without making him free.<br />THe 2nd Renassiance (1 and 2) tell an amazing history story of everything behind the matrix (in their world) and keeps you glued to what goes on.  They describe how they \\"scortch the sky\\" too.
B00K2CHVJ4|4|A likeable movie If you know Godzilla movies. It was done right.
B009IU69JY|5|Just great
0767802624|4|If there was ever a movie to blow the doors off of alien conspiracies in a hilarious way this is it. For no other reason than that, Men in Black is a well-deserved hit. Combine that classic sci-fi charm with a smart combination of different special effects techniques and the chemistry of actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith and you have a recipe for fun.  <br /> <br />Probably the most intriguing element of Men in Black for me is its classic sci-fi charm. The urban legends of the men in black surfaced around the 50's and this movie seems to tip its hat at that prospect. The aliens and gadgets all have that classic 50's sci-fi B-movie aspect in regards to their looks and names. The B-movie aspect is all the funnier when Tommy Lee and the gang interact with this strangeness as if it were an everyday thing. In addition to the classic sci-fi fun you also see some fun with the whole government conspiracy to hide the truth. I'm telling you it's great fun seeing MIB agents with their deadpan looks handle completely outrageous situations.  <br /> <br />This movie oozes style. Not only with the sci-fi space guns and tech but also the look of the MIB headquarters. It's another throwback to the 50's with some major art deco designs and black and white color schemes. It's like looking into one of those freaky classic movies. Special effects can be a mixed bag, but still fun to watch. You get some really good animatronic effects with a few aliens as well as computer animation, but I tend to give more kudos to the animatronic side of things here. While the CG stuff looks good at a distance it starts to lack on closer shots with that very noticeable shine you get from making a too glossy surface. <br /> <br />Another plus on style is the Jones/Smith interaction. It's a lot like a buddy cop film where the two partners are very different from each other. Tommy Lee's straight and serious Agent Friday style of professionalism is perfectly juxtaposed by Will's irreverent wisecrackingstyle. My favorite performance is from Vincent D'Onofrio, who made an enormously entertaining performance as the bug in an Edgar suit. I don't think you could have gotten a better cast.  <br /> <br />While Men in Black is a definite plus it does have a few limitations. For one the pacing of the movie feels rushed in a certain way, although it's hard to put my finger on. I suppose Will's indoctrination into MIB worked well, but after he became an agent, things moved more mechanically than dynamically. Might be more of a time constraint issue than anything else. Also this movie is slimy. You will find lots of gooey and icky stuff splattering all over the place. Some of you might get into it. I just feel like I need a shower.  <br /> <br />Men in Black is ultimately light entertainment that pokes fun at the genre while at the same time being true to it. The only people I can't recommend this movie to are the ones who are looking for a whole lot of depth in the story, or can't get around the slimy stuff.
B00CO8D3G4|5|This book really gets you thinking.  There is some great insight in this book, and I also believe James' premise that jobs are becoming a commodity.  Hence, choose yourself.  I love that he actually gives the reader business ideas to consider.  That is so refreshing and different from the others that provide vague frameworks.  This is well worth your time to read.
B006BDHAX0|4|I like everything about this version of mahjong solitaire. The puzzles are a good size, and my eyes adjusted quickly to the tile patterns. I would recommend this for anybody. Very relaxing.

0765326353|2|I admire Sanderson's ability to write quickly, but his nanowrimo-like approach has some serious drawbacks.  And the flaws are readily and frequently apparent in this latest work of his.  Now, the world I did find the story interesting, and will most likely continue reading the series, but I really wish Sanderson would slow down and improve the quality of his prose. For instance, every character's POV is littered with an overabundance of rhetorical questions which make the story sound amateurish and the characters' thought frequently redundant. Too many characters have similar reactions--sniffing or raising one eyebrow.  Many of the female characters feel more Robert Jordan-esque: a woman famed for her wit and grace considers throwing a tantrum twice to her her way.  And too many times a character says something dramatic and then jogs off.<br /><br />Too many scenes seem to reveal Sanderson striving to write to his outline, at the expense of things like character development, good dialogue, and plot progression.  The prose is often overwritten.  Phrases like \\"as literal as the rocks themselves\\" or \\"waved curtly\\"or \\"frowned in sorrow\\" are puzzlingly bad.  The dialogue suffers too: the scene where one character tells another \\"My sense of honor makes me easy to manipulate\\" is just sad.  Creatures named the \\"songlings\\" won't ever be part of good world building.  Parts of it aren't thought out either--a character who can't afford to heat his house is able to get drunk on strong wine. The plots seem contrived; a character drops something and the wind immediately picks up and blows it away.  The characters aren't particularly interesting early on.  The theology and philosophy are dumbed down and misrepresented to an embarrassing degree.<br /><br />Nearly ever character who is meant to be clever simply interprets words literally.  This isn't clever, especially not after one or two times.  Other mildly sarcastic remarks elicit surprised approval and comments on intelligence from onlookers.  A supposedly clever character responds to her allies instruction of \\"Keep your wits about you,\\" with a joke about keeping her wits about her would mean that someone got too close with a cudgel.  That's not witty, that's annoying.  It's hard to believe that sarcasm is such a rare commodity in any world.  A main character having an invisible fairy on his shoulder reminds me of the Secret of Mana, except that what works in a video game doesn't translate into the written world.<br /><br />On aspect of the world-building I like is the invention of new taboo words.  But simply substituting \\"storm\\" in the same context as our bad words make his supposedly battle-hardened slaves sound unfortunately like the Smurfs.  And putting you assassin in white clothes isn't inverting or playing with tropes, at least not in an interesting way. It's also creepy to read a book written by a Mormon with the question: \\"What would the world be like if all men lived by the book?\\"  The addition of high-born women hiding their hand in sleeves is likewise reminiscent of funny mormon underwear.<br /><br />All that aside, I am interested in the world and the developments.  I am curious about what happens next.  I think this is a good story told poorly--with tighter prose and better editing, he could have had a 400 page book that would have stood as a new classic.  As it is, Sanderson's ability to write so quickly is turning out to hurt him as much as it helps him..

B005MF1O5S|5|I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about in regards to this episode being 'filler'.  I suppose that it might not be directly related to the 'silence' theme this season, the relationship between Rory, Amy, and the Doctor is extremely important to the show. This episode develops each of these characters in new and interesting ways. If all you want is plot progression, read a summary of the season after it airs.  If what you love are the people, you will love this episodes--my favorite this season.
B00F35B8F8|5|Have always been a fan, and this interpretation and prequel was very well done. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend to any si-fi fan.
1452110581|5|Since I'm a cat-lover, this book really did appeal to me ... as well as my family members and other friends who like cats.<br />The words in this book must surely have come straight from the mouth of a cat.  It's wonderful, funny, and true, I'm sure.<br />Would recommend to anyone.
