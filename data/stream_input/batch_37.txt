B005NLQAHS|4|This works well with the torque app on my Droid Mini and 2003 Nissan Frontier. I had tried a much cheaper (and smaller) version of this device before and it would not sync bluetooth. This device worked flawlessly. My only gripe is that it is so damn large. In my truck, it is easy to catch my toe on this thing when I attempt to activate my emergency brake. Being a stick-shift, this is essentially every time I park the vehicle, and has been an argument for me to not use it a lot of the time.
B0031I0NF0|5|works with 1999 corolla, perfect.
B010MHV00O|5|This is the best adapter out there for Nalgene bottles and hydro flask. It the perfect fit for both. I have the 40 oz Hydro Flask and its tall but this adapter still keeps it in place. It will not fall over.
B00CE2Q4LQ|2|Sticker looks faded, like the printer was running out of ink when they printed it. Does not look authentic to actual NRA stickers.
B00G3BRNOG|5|I'll tell you why.<br />I was running Mobil 1 High Mileage in my 1990 Dodge Dakota with about 300,000 miles on it. It was due for a change so I fed it the Purple and gave it the matching filter just 2 days ago. All the engine noise has completely disappeared. There was lifter knock, now not a peep. Oil pressure is straight in the middle of the L and H, even with the fresh Mobil 1 I'd only reach 1/3 across the gauge and less when it got hot. RP is straight up on the gauge all the way to work and back.<br />~$7.50 a quart to keep my old Dodge alive for another few years is a bargain, and Royal Purple is the best oil money can buy.<br />Backstory:<br />The reason I switched my truck over to RP is because I did it to my wife's 96 Dakota first. Her's got the 10W-40 HPS.<br />The oil pump is/was worn in her truck and oil pressure was low. I took her truck to a mechanic who tried to clean all the gunk out, but oil pressure remained low, so he changed the oil to 10W40 (cheap stuff) and added a quart of Lucas. That kept her oil pressure just above the L when hot. A few months later I changed her over to RP and her oil pressure problems were solved, and her engine runs quiet and smooth. No more Lucas, no more oil warning lights.<br />Going forward, I'll never use another brand of motor oil (unless RP gets bought out by the Chinese or something) in any of my vehicles. It's worth every penny.
B004BZOKIS|5|That's what I'm talking about just bring the gas pedal up where I needed it
B005O0QQ1S|5|Perfection
B008ZDRSCM|1|would not stay tight and wanted to pop off.
B00N57OC68|5|Works fine, price was great.  Only needed one.  Now I have 3 spare.
B00HJ15E4K|4|Expected it to be waterproof but the mesh isn't.
B000GRS2G6|5|Great cover
B000C2WDCE|4|Worked as excpected....haven't had any problems so far no leaks.....seems to be of decent quality haven't had it long enough to know how long it will last
B000EDQQJW|5|I ordered this for my RV since I don't have much counter/work space.  After examining how the adjustment feet worked I put the sink cover over, adjusted the feet and I'm thrilled.  This board looks great and it adds space while leaving my other sink open to use!  I would order this again but please note ... it is NOT a cutting board.  It is a counter extension - very solid fit in my sink and I've put warm things on it but I wouldn't cut on it or put very hot items on it.
B00480J4KA|4|Good product, as advertised.  Great price.
B007T9ER5O|5|Works well
B0006O2PCQ|2|Smell great but doesn't last very long.
B001G6VA1K|5|What a steal, pretty good filter for the price.
B009GJ99ZS|1|Leaked.
B004PC0BNK|2|Very cheaply made.
B001E1RVKQ|5|Always works. Glad I could buy it here. Will purchase again.
B008BCSEMU|5|Works great! Originally got the clutch with out the friction hub, but found my old hub was pitted so for the price ordered this one with the extra part and works great! Arrived completely sealed and boxed and greased and build quality seems good!
B00IBM5KPO|4|Perfect for what intended.
B00N8L7TCU|1|i got it wiait out rapil and scrow
B009UOTYUY|5|Nice light and doesn't waste a lot of power...
B002OWFLC4|1|This is too big to fit in any small space.
B005N53AM2|5|I bought a new-to-me used van and wanted to dress it up inside a little bit.  I love the design of this and I love how it feels under my hands.  It's summer now but I think I'm going to love it in the winter when it's cold because the steering wheel won't be so cold under my hands.  The only thing I didn't like is that it had a strong rubbery scent for the first couple of weeks.  Luckily that faded and now I can't smell it at all.
B00QNQOVC8|4|I love the hammock.  It is very sturdy, room enough for two, and doesn't swallow you up if you are in there by yourself.  Seems durable so far and is easy to pack back up into the pouch.  My only complaint is that the ropes are pretty short, so you can't wrap them around a tree of any real size.  Unless you have strong low branches, you need bigger straps to make this work.  Otherwise, it is a great purchase!
B000AMBHG4|5|Perfect replacement for my old unit which is no longer in production.
B003VS6YHQ|5|Really like this
B00332ULW4|5|Fit like a glove
B004EQECFA|5|This was perfect.  It looks fantastic and I couldn't be happier.
B00LUZB9LI|4|Pretty cool
B00F8LEB9W|5|Couldn't have been any easier to program. It literally took about 2 minutes to read the directions and one minute to program. They both work great and I was able to reprogram the extra remote I had previously. Now I have three that all work. You can't beat the price and I can't tell any difference between the OEM remotes and these.
B00VOL7CKK|5|Works just like it should.  Great product
B0084LT5VM|1|Don't fit right, and broke when window went up
B005JU5XOO|4|I've purchased these wipers a number of times and I've never been disappointed. Installation is a snap, literally.  5 minutes and you're set.
B0089SZW62|4|nice finish
B00B9ET8IG|1|No one seems to cut these nor will they program the chip for you at any discounted rate. Unless you find a store that does, dont waste your money
B001RM7WKQ|5|fits well on a 2004 Mini Cooper S.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Super easy to install and use. Made my bike run smoothly with the new pipes and breather.
B005UNQXOE|1|Didn't notice any increase in HP or gas mileage, engine ran exactly as it did prior to use.
B00JH25KV6|5|Couldn't believe that was the price. Excellent product. No complaints
B0067UDR2K|5|OEM part and it was 1/2 of local dealer price. Pulled a code on our old 2000 XC.V70 and cylinder 5 was not firing. We smelled raw gas so knew the the injector was fine and it was a slim chance the spark plug was at fault.<br /><br />Volvo dealer wanted $100 for the coil and another $150+ for labor. We ordered form Amazon and received the same part. It's a direct replacement of same make and type as what was being replaced.  We saved $200 for this repair and doing the work took only about 30 minutes and I am a novice mechanic here.<br /><br />Buy an inexpensive code reader here on Amazon and handle some of the repairs where you -can- do them yourself. $ saved.
B000CQDKY0|5|great
B000BQSIWK|5|WORKS GREAT .
B00REJX5BQ|4|Good price. Fits well and looks good on my ram 1500 short bed.
B00G0DYIVS|5|Great price and instant shipping. Replaced OEM bulb in my 5th wheel Cedar Creek RV refrigerator (light) with this LED to cut down on heat and battery drain. Works great. Cant go wrong. I will be replacing all my OEM rv bulbs with LEDs.
B000GANZZ6|5|This converter/charger is very quiet and delivers as advertised. The seller omitted the pendant and I called PD and they sent me one free of charge. Cool little gadget. I'm using it to recharge 2 US 6v deep cycle batteries in series and it does it's job just fine. I'm very satisfied so far with this product.
B00ZEJGDT4|5|This cap fits perfect just what i wanted has a magnet to attach it to the door while fueling. Much better than the plastic cover Ram sends on the truck. Can't wait until they make a matching DEF cap i will buy it too. 5 stars all the way.
B008WXUK3Y|5|Great
B00BLYCZA2|3|Prongs are little short compared to the halogen bulbs, bass is wider makes it hard fit
B002YLRN30|2|No What I want but ok for now
B000EFN07G|5|Well made product but was broke in shipment. I used the internal parts to fix the other tail light.
B004GCZF7Q|5|Excellent. Came on time. works great.
B00MP6N97S|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B0046ZCBK2|5|Sweet, Bolted right up to my 2013 Genisus 3.8 trac, Purrs like a lion and roars like i,m in beast mode :) Thank you Borla for a great sound and thrill!
B007Q144I0|5|very nice

B009IF3J5Q|5|as expected, good stuff
B00LIB44XY|5|They was perfect an on time. .... oh yea.... thanks
B00OAANXIM|3|Paint pen has round tip, not a chisel point.
B000BZAAJ0|5|High quality Item but very slow delivery !!!!
B00AFVDOPW|3|The quality was not as good as the previous one that I had in my car
B000CITK8S|5|works great
B007QHQB3U|5|easy install with training video on the web.  working great on my Pathfinder
B00IKKS4W8|5|Great the originals on Trailer needed to have replacement and this was perfect.
B007S82A3C|5|Excellent!
B000RUFBA2|3|I purchased this hitch for my 2011 Nissan Xterra, because of the excellent reviews about it actually fitting the car- which is a very important feature for most auto parts! True to the reviews, it fit just right. Unfortunately, the manufacturer supplied it with some extremely sub-par bolts, for installation.<br /><br />Just a brief background on the install, it basically consists of 6 bolts- 4 of which are already on your Xterra. The ones on your Xterra will go on just fine (once you get them off). The two remaining bolts are the ones I am referencing. The stripped on the first attempt of fastening them. Note I was using hand tools. They might have worked fine with an Impact wrench, but they almost instantly stripped with hand tools.<br /><br />I all my shame, I had to pay a mechanic $90 dollars (Chicago area mechanics are a rip off) to re-tap and attach the final two bolts.<br /><br />If you have air tools, this should be an easy install for you. Otherwise, you might end up with your tail between your legs at your mechanic. Clearly this could have been avoided by either better bolts, or at least a second set given the garbage they packaged with this. A friend with Air tools would be helpful as well.<br /><br />One other minor complaint, I find that this hitch sticks out a little further than is necessary. Good luck!
B004RZMCCI|5|K
B00HW1RE2W|5|A good tool to have on hand.
B000XQQ0A0|5|Can't beat magnaflow
B006P0WNMW|4|This is a fair oil for the price. I would not hesitate to use it in most Asian/American cars. However, this oil is not approved for any of the Euro auto brands and I would never use it in MB or VW (VAG). Its specs are not good enough for the Euro iron. Mag1 (Warren) makes a specific Euro oil and it is more suitable for the Euro applications, but I would not gamble and get a major brand like M1, especially their 0w40.  Otherwise a decent oil for 5-6k OCE in a lesser demanding applications.
B000CJ71RO|5|Fit 2006 Sienna as advertise.
B00EE56UAG|5|excellent lock
B00PLQCKBA|5|Good oil
B00FLFMU8O|5|Same as others sell for 3.00 each
B003TQ87PM|5|LOVE IT,LEAVES THE TIRES AND RUBBER AREAS ON MY TRUCK LOOK GREAT
B0032YYK66|5|It fits perfect
B002EWW7SA|5|Love Them Looks really great on my bike!!!!! Had no issue on putting them on take old ones out new ones in.
B00EYGCBEO|3|Not as long as I would have liked but cute an soft.
B00ALV059O|5|Product works like a charm.  I would purchase more SINS products in the future if needed.
B006SYNF9K|5|It protects my dashboard from excessive sunlight..nice design too!
B005ZFB7QQ|5|It work great
B000C2CBVW|4|Flat gasket that fits and seals for the right price.
B000FMO6XU|5|This little tool works great to get grease into sealed boots in the steering area.
B00CPL918E|5|Using in a 2002 M5 without any concerns.  Blackstone UOA has been positive.  Bottom line, a 10W-60 that is easier to get than now defunct Castrol TWS
B00QQ4UATK|5|excellent product and unbelievable price  very nice!
B00H1ES6S6|5|Great upgrade for interior lights where they fit.  Nice color temperature and output.  All so far have worked so re-ordering to replace everywhere possible in vehicles.
B00XAIZ4RS|4|Fits my 2013 Laredo fine. Rugged. Traction keeps items from slipping around while driving.
B00480J4QY|1|Well, seemed great, so I thought. I have had them 9 months and now one of them went out, on low beam setting. That seems a bit too short for a headlight bulb given that the previous factory ones I had lasted 12 years.
B00FCGK6YM|5|I love this sticker for my car! Now that I will be changing my NM license plate to a different state, I can still represent my home state through sticker art! &#60;3
B00HZ54H66|4|wear gloves this stuff makes your skin itch....
B004BWU8H8|4|Rattles a bit but otherwise great product.
B000C9WJ8K|5|Great product great service
B00HUGND6K|5|GLAD I BOUGHT 2!!
B009OBVS2K|5|Wasn't expecting much, but the stuff really works!
B004J00NBI|5|The hose fit the application, as expected.  I cannot really assess its performance until it has had a chance to perform for the minimum expected time, which in this vehicle, is at least for the next 100,000 miles.  If it does not last at least that long, I will certainly be disappointed and will give a review that reflects that disappointment.
B00UJ5YL6U|5|My husband loves his new light bars! He has been talking for so long about getting some for his can am, but he never found the ones he really loved. When I was offered this product in return for my honest, unbiased review, he was so excited. He finally was able to get him some light bars. We live in the country, and many times he and his friends ride out in the woods. These lights really help him to see better at night. It has helped him out so much! They are the perfect brightness. They are not too bright but at the same time, not too dull. They are perfect to see in the dark. We have been getting so much rain lately, I was worried they would get ruined in the rain. It has been over four days of constant raining, but the lights are still working perfectly! They are made of the absolute best quality! He also stated they were so easy to connect to the can am.
B006LO8SKI|5|Great Current... Starts the Harley Every time !!  Fits like a Glove !!  Nothing better !!
B00IBOMS1Q|5|Good for my 2015 Mazda 3 gt. I just wish it was a bit thicker.
B000PDONMI|3|They did the job for me, to hold bikes to rack, but the webbing is not the best. If you are going to use a lot forget these. Ratchet works great.
B00EA0ZB7I|2|They turn on, they're bright, but they're way too much of a blue white to be useful for the application I had in mind. Also the mounting hardware is cheap and the stainless bolts strip the aluminum mounting block easily. They do have a 'spot beam' but there's a lot of wasted light. For 20 bucks I'll keep them, but I'll be looking somewhere else for my project.
B00X9Y2H8M|5|Loved the stickers I received. They're really good quality stickers and there were only a few I didn't really like.
B00029WRMI|3|Its worth it for the price
B000EDQR50|5|Great price.  Will probably order another set for spares.
B00CDCMSA8|5|AWESOME TOWEL FOR GLASS AND DETAILING CARS
B00LKXJ3DQ|5|Great product and relatively easy to use.
B001UCGPWO|2|Scorched and the squeal
B00HFO1TZE|1|Cheap, the 3m stickers on back are good, but there is glue and air between the fiber and clear plastic, after letting it heat up a bit in the sun it got even worse, you can see the clear plastic with bublbes of some sort of glue and air mixed in,  i threw it in the trash!  POS  only reason it got a star, there are no zeros to click on !!
B00BD4SP4A|1|Did not fit in either of my mini suv or suv. And clamps wouldn't stay locked strings broke. Still need to return it bit not sure if I can with broke strings. Took 3 people about 20 minutes to realize it just wasn't going to work
B0023VFPM2|5|I used this on a 2004 F-250 and it was shipped very quickly and installed in just a few moments. Great product at a good price.
B00FRHOGU6|1|Junk. After a few weeks they couldn't clean the windshield properly. Such a shame as I remember RainX products on my old Honda working great. I switched out of these after just 2 months because I couldn't stand it anymore - and these were on my wife's car! If they were on mine, they would have been gone much faster.<br /><br />Replaced them with the Bosch Icon wipers and they work like a dream. Stay away from RainX wipers!
B0002JMLQU|5|Yep it works. Pretty much instantly..5 miles all shudder gone. Another one of those &#34;I can't believed that worked&#34;
B003ILF3R8|5|heavy duty front floor mats
B00CZ8FIFC|1|After receiving my tank with a damaged gauge I went and bought a gauge because I was leaving on a trip and did not have time to send it  back Well when I tried to use it for my mower here was the outcome The hose is vinyl and very delicate.none of the fittings swivel and very hard to mount on an air fitting.I can't imagine using this air hose in the cold weather.So if you want to spend 60.00 for a tank and replace everything buy this tank.
B001O08B06|5|Perfect fit
B00B4KU3X4|1|JUNK!!!!! Lasted about a week.
B00UXO1OTO|5|Fob works great and the directions provided made programming a simple and quick task. Saved quite a bit of money over the quotes I had for others to do this simple job for me. Thanks!
B00HXP739Q|5|This product could not be better.  I love it!
B00F2B80YK|3|Mine was DOA (from this seller), but I have another one which has worked great as a tuning aid for small engines. Note that the refresh time and sampling resolution is too slow for chainsaws (IMHO), plus you need to wrap the plug lead to test<br /><br />These things have a non replaceable internal battery (which I believe was dead on the unit I ordered). My old one is still OK after 2 years, but you should consider this thing disposable. BTW, I returned DOA unit and Amazon (bless them) refunded promptly<br /><br />I will probably invest in a good wireless tach with fast refresh (about $125). These have replaceable batteries, and will work with chainsaws.
B008KWLE1Y|5|Easy replacement for a broken one in my Dometic.
B000BYGGH6|5|Decent price on plug wires, Just what I needed for a tune-up.
B004K0XCII|5|This was a quality replacement that went in just like it should. The fitment was perfect.
B000C5G5K2|5|Best price I found anywhere ! Being a 1997 ElDo it was not easy to find a perfect fit at a reasonable price. Fast shipping!
B002E02MOQ|5|Used this after clay bar and polishing with Meguair's compound and #205. This stuff wipes off with 0 effort which is nice and it leaves the paint looking like glass!! I can't speak for it's durability but the immediate results are worth it!
B00NB8TLOY|5|I love this for my CRV. They are so bright.
B0041CDPQO|5|Plenty of cord.  Good deep socket...for receptacle support.  For those like me.....that don't want to &#34;hardwire&#34; into the factory wiring system.
B00WG2KD4S|4|Great price, good quality
B0013CUA86|4|Good price and product. One of the two arrived broken and unusable but Amazon quickly sent a replacement at no charge.
B00LHUI4XM|5|Excellent plate!<br />Absolutely no obscurence of vital plate info for all law and otherwise parties. It is beautiful, solid, secure and a thin design.<br />The theft proof screws and caps are excellent!
B000WMNTPY|5|Easy to install, One thing to note though, the plastic bar ends don't absorb as much of the vibration... which I didn't like, but they were longer so I opted to using them incase my bike goes down! These were easy to install, and look sleek and nice!
B00J138F3Q|5|Very impressed.
B001429I5Q|4|It's a great cover. easy to put on once you do it once. However, if you let it form a puddle on the top, the water will penetrate into your car (I have a jeep) so make sure the water runs down the cover, no puddles on the cover and you'll be fine.
B01092ICIA|4|Fair price fast delivery. I was happy with previous seat covers from FH. They lasted quite a while. Wear and tear from friction getting in and out of my truck, I managed to keep my seats looking new. This latest purchase is 3rd set of covers having my truck since 2007
B00BMUDOLE|5|nice battery
B00BQE5HUW|3|not very bright. I know it's difficult to make yellow LEDs bright, but still was quite dim
B0080E6YVW|5|Works like a charm.  :D
B00PWG6AC4|5|My Ford Explorer windshield is almost too SMALL for this item, there are two of them, very generous in size, excellent quality, I have a custom Ford dashboard cover so got lazy about using a set of these. But oh boy, on a 95 degree day what a difference they make. They are the first generation kind, very easy to fold into the little circle size, but I just put them in the back seat open because they are great to hide a laptop and packages back there. (BTW don't leave a lap top in that kind of heat for more than a few minutes or you'll fry your hard drive, been there, done that.) Don't hesitate to purchase this item and the price is awesome, quick ship. AAAAA+ I'd give it 10 stars if I could !
B00DPIEG0O|5|Perfect fit for my 2010 Prius, had to replace the old mat this one did the trick.
B001BJZJBE|5|Great price on a top quality OE belt, half the price of local parts stores
B000C2UDBC|5|You can always count on three things with a Gates Product. Quality, durability, and fitment. All this at a great price through Amazon is a plus also.
B00E9BE3J0|1|This was ordered to fit s 2005 Ford F-250, the fit is not exact and for the price a bit disappointed.
B00DSR4JZE|4|Came quickly, look good but smaller than I thought
B00ML84E3I|5|easy to apply, look great on my car, love the color, slightly smaller than I thought but OK.
B000BUQOEK|4|Good
B000C2QOAG|5|great sevice
B000CAZ60C|5|Gave it the shake test, put it on my 2001 corolla and have been using it for a couple months now without issue.
B00M5EJORY|5|great sevice
B00CHDB9TE|5|Im happy with it
B00TEICVHY|4|Works great and fits perfectly.. if you have the right spot for it in your dash or console. I put this on my 2006 Scion xB, thankfully there was 1 place it would fit naturally, that was in the only unused blank in the center console. This will not fit in the center dash switch holes, which is originally where I wanted to mount it but the center console will have to do. Also, be sure to check you depth clearance, this power socket hangs down inside pretty far and if there's something close to the hole it'll bottom out.
B00KJ8L6BK|5|Easy install, worked immediately with no issues.
B009FUFCDQ|5|cant beat the price.
B0088BBQC4|1|The filter is advertised as a fit for my 2002 XTerra, and although the element has the correct dimensions to match my stock filter, the rubber surround DOES NOT allow for a DROP IN fitment. Also note that this is a filter that was developed &#34;in partnership with K&N&#34;. In my opinion, this seems like a rebranded K&N filter that they are saying fits many vehicles in order to clear them out; the filter itself has K&N branding on it. Google searching the part number on the filter garnered indication that it is the filter from a kit intended for a Land Rover. Total BS, in my opinion.
B001C4SM08|5|Perfect Snug Fit. I read reviews both good & bad reviews before I made my purchase. I dont see how anyone can complain about anything other than the price. Its been under the hood all Summer w/ 110 degree heat index & looks as good as it did day one. I have taken it off to check the filter condition & its absolutely flawless. No noticeable restricition when the ecoboost turbos demand suction on my 13' F150 FX4. Still the same sound, throttle response, & Fuel Mileage as before the k&n dry charger.  I wanted to wait a couple months  to give an honest review. Its Common Sense that it has to cause atleast a very slight restriction. Well the K&N Engineers knocked that one out the park bc it is NOT anything you can notice. Common Sense also says if you have this K&N Cold air intake this SOCK FILTER/DRY CHARGER is a MUST HAVE. THE PROTECTION IT IS GIVING YOUR ENGINE &/or $50,000 Truck from Moisture, Rain, Fog, Humidity,Etc. is a benefit that outweighs the risk by far.<br /><br />If you are trying to Void your warranty or dont care about costly damages then go get a Tuner, headers, full exaust, & a cold air intake that will suck more air than your MAF sensor can handle.then that engine light on your dash will be shining bright & have you wondering why. Know what you want & what type of mods you are looking to invest in before just grabbing anyone at random because its &#34;payday&#34;
B0051SEBW4|4|The perfect thing to get my R 65LS bar to the right height. The threads on the bolts are a bit sharp, so I would be carefull if threading them into aluminum. Just put a tad of grease on the threads and no problem. Also the bolts could stand to just a bit longer.
B004GNCRT4|5|Fast shipping, Great for works
B001O80SVS|5|Works great. Quiet operation and install was simple. I highly recommend this product.
B00JXYEU78|5|works great product as discribed.  had to lose extra brackets to get in place  because bolts sticking out backside that was not there on the factory.  Need to have low pressure switch included because you cannot get old one out without ruining it  so that it could be transferred
B00KB8DMS8|5|The bushings worked perfectly and easy install I would recommend it to everyone
B000O51VJ0|5|Very pleased with the product and the timely shipping.  If you can't have a real campfire this product is the way to go.
B0076I39NO|4|for the price is an excellent product
B000CIFVN6|4|Does not come with cap. Works well on metal, plastic, vinyl. This is a great product for a great price
B00CRR3Z7E|5|Best pair I have used to date....
B005EMZHA2|5|Was better than I expected.
B009W4QPN6|5|All good
B00937X9ZE|5|Worked perfectly was very fast getting it
B000GZCUAC|5|Running nice and smooth.
B00029WYEY|5|Surprisingly easy to use; just followed the directions. Cleaned the filter beautifully and the oiling was way easy.
B000BYB4DC|4|Fits as expected, although they are not as well-appointed as the NGK ones, which makes sense for the price point.<br />The heatshields are slip-on rather than overmolded and there aren't any cylinder number tags, but they work.
B000E1AVOU|4|This hitch was supposed to fit my 2005 Suburban with no drilling, however it did require me to drill 2 holes in the frame. The holes were drilled easily and the hitch was simple to mount. I use it for a front-mount bike carrier. The total install time was about 15 minutes and I'm not a mechanic. I undid the 2 bolts holding the front hooks on, attached the hitch to that mounting point, drilled 2 half inch holes for the rear mounting point, placed two thread adapters into the frame and then bolted the rear. The only fiddly part was lining up the thread adapters, but I figured it out pretty quick.
B00C5T54M8|5|Performs as expected.
B00KTJ5OJ4|5|Perfect. Easy to program. Shipped fast & packed well.
B00B9FEHCW|5|Nice! Broke one of the clips on install but worked around it. Wish the plastic clips were stronger.
B003ZNZAEA|4|Brighter bulbs and a 5 star. Halo is so dim you can barely see it.
B00SWE2O6E|5|doing a modification on a yard tractor blade.  tow it behind jeep.  this worked ideal for the modification.
B00KTICUQU|5|LOOKS OEM, QUICK SHIPPING
B007Y869JM|5|Excellent product, pretty easy to install.
B002YKMCDW|3|I like the concept but it has a flaky chrome coating.  It would have been much better to use quality metal but for the price and occasional use it is OK.
B0051RI0J0|1|Fitment was very poor quality
B00B3OE5W6|5|I like it!
B00ONDM07G|4|Works with my HTC One M8 with Otterbox Commuter.  Slight shake on city steets, smooth on the highway and nicer roads.  Handles my heavy phone very well.  Took away a star because it gouged the soft plastic where it rests.
B008VJXXLK|4|works well
B00EECLNQ0|5|replaced both in car and light much more 'white' than original HID and much lower cost!
B002P8AR4Y|1|Doesn't match original side mirror, didn't come as shown, sellers offered refund and to take it back, but you want the product you paid for when you paid for it.  Also advertised as paintable... they told me to sand it first in order to get paint to stick.  No thank you.
B00169G4AE|5|perfect quality and fit
B00V9HLRDC|4|Expected them to be a little bit brighter. But other than that I love it. Plug and play. No problems. Had them for a week. No flickering what so ever. Great job. Great product
B00L8TA2T6|4|this perfect, I recommend
B009AA9XHC|5|Work great.
B004XONSYE|5|Fit perfect no leaks.I don't have temp gauge but after filter and fluid change shifts better and tranny must run cooler with airflow thru tubes.
B009IK67Y6|5|Used to power a Sirius Onyx mounted in dash....had to change connector, but didn't have to rewire the 12v supply.  Well made & quality item.
B00OYEBWF0|4|perfect fit same size as stock  thought would be a little thicker shaft  than stock but all good
B00HX3X25W|1|Had them professionally installed and the installers said they were the most uncut sticker they have ever tried to install. I like the look but the stickers I got were cut uneven. So the sides don't match.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Nice enough item; it doesn't seem like it will fall apart like my last sun protector. It was too short, as expected for a 2015 Chevy Sonic Sedan (33 in versus the 29 in height). It does fit a 2012 Toyota Prius C well enough.
B00TO62JZ0|5|Fits Megan coilovers works great
B00913NKCC|4|Great product, fits as good as could be, the RAM seat design is not an easy one...
B00B7QES6S|5|I like it, just noticed my neighbor has the same name brand on a car, he has had it for years. Perhaps one negative no hole for non-retractable antenna.
B00FX6N7DI|4|Got it.
B000KL18HI|5|It works having fun now. It was delivered quickly, and easy to install.
B00YDKKD6Y|5|no problems
B000M5YYIW|4|Used as a replacement for prop-nut lock on my boat's outdrive. Rusted thoroughly after one week of freshwater usage. Safe to say these are not stainless steel, but then again, it doesn't say that anywhere on the page either. Other than that, they seem to work just fine.
B00YC6JGSU|5|I ordered these lights for my 1982 cj5. I did have to trim the headlamp assembly a little for the light to fit in, but I'm extremely pleased with them. The low beam setting is bright enough to drive with no problem, and the high beam setting lights up everything.  I can see far away with these. Definitely worth it for the money.
B007H2OPN2|4|This vent was the only flap style vent to perfectly match the cut-out hole on my RV. It is on the expensive side but well worth it because of the sturdiness and quality. Installation was a breeze.<br />The only complaint I have is with the flap locks. They are hard to engage and disengage thus the reason for the deduction of one star.<br />Overall I am pleased and also happy to block the elements and insects from entering my RV.
B0042XORMI|5|Amazing deal! You cant beat this value and I always have the fuse I need on hand.
B001UJH13O|4|i got one you OWE  me the other
B007EZOIMU|1|These were useless. Gave them away. Could not get them to stay on the car.
B002J7VX4Y|1|Not at all as advertised -- smells really awful. Steer clear of this stuff,
B002P8SXLI|5|Perfect price !!!
B007AAUUC6|5|This is a great product. I like that it is not permanent to the vehicle. The only downside is the cords, at first. You don't notice them after a week or so.
B008G23K4C|5|excellent!!!
B00164XD12|4|Good product
B0083G3AXC|5|it looks easy enough to use & I lke the fact that there are 2 cup holders as I'm putting it on one chair & 2 people can use it for their Jameson & club soda!!!!
B00PT5OA2U|5|Brings a lot of attention at the range.
B000E24APU|5|Read all the reviews.  Sure, this product has some limitations (especially with color match) but it works and is relatively easy to use.
B00OZXAWH4|4|It was great it fit perfectly
B00JDX23A0|5|Adds greatly to the engine compartment
B002Z645TO|5|As ordered, fits well and looks to be made with quality material. I liked the padding on the inside of the cover and the way the draw string is easily accessible.
B00BTHNEDI|5|Very good bulbs.
B00GJMQS90|3|too small
B008UR7J6I|5|Great product that worked first time out of the box.  Paired it to my Google Nexus 7 (Gen 2).  Codes, status, and logs worked as advertised.  Nice to have access to the actual codes before taking my 2009 BMW 3 Series to the dealer.
B00OTG9K9I|3|the distro company if fine i'm sure.  I got it when they said.  But the product as a whole is a bit limiting, and you have to purchase the pro version of the companion app to get any real time data
B00I3S0S8U|3|These are ok, not that bright.
B00AYEVRWW|4|Replacing this part cleared up the P0013 and P0014 OBD codes that were popping up on our '09 Malibu (2.4L Ecotec I-4). Time will tell how long the solenoid will hold up.
B00T2GT9L4|4|Well Put together!
B004NB4ZEO|5|So far so good.  Mounted up and matched the old OEM part exactly. So installing it was a breeze.  The quality of the part seemed to be built very well, although time will tell as its only been installed a week.  So no real extensive information is available for me to share.  But if  I needed another part like this I would not hesitate to purchase it again.
B00CCYWJQK|3|The system works great , I have used this product for years but my most recent purchase leaks around one of the connectors ,,  have tried plumbers ta pe but will not seal.  Need partial replacement of part that is defective?  Unable to return due to use of product in black water system.
B000EVYI4E|5|Works with factory GM sending units.  Installed it into my 1981 Chevy C20 Crew Cab so I can monitor the fuel level in my second tank.  Hooked up to a stock GM sending unit, reads as accurately as the factory gauge in the dashboard.
B00I5XNRUE|3|This is not actually a decal sticker, it's just a sticker. So I got fingerprints all over it because I thought it was a decal (like it says it is) but the clear doesn't peel off.
B00K1C1WC2|5|hard to knock a chock
B0012ZEZ8A|5|Good kit for beginers that dont want to spend a lot of money in products at the local autopart .
B004AH4MWG|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B0054RW1HE|1|If you go over 30 mph they just move. s***ty buy
B00TEA5PZC|5|Thanks, great product and Customer Service
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Great little device.  It can also be used as a meter- to check if the alternator is working.  Hook it up- rev the RPM's...look and see it voltage rises.  A very inexpensive way to check the Alt. to see if it's charging.  Bought one as a gift for my son.
B00BIR1KJE|5|I can't tell you how many compliments I've received on this product.  I've given out your website to numerous friends and family.  It's always &#34;WHERE did you get that?  HOW COOL!&#34;  And truly, it is the best invention ever.  I have 2 dogs to walk and rarely do I wear something with pockets big enough to safely hold my phone. This gives me easy access, in case of an emergency.  Going to put a whistle on it also, in case I run into something scary.
B003O0YESW|5|They work great, and were easy to install.
B007T12UK6|3|Easy to install and looks good BUT... The passenger side is loose and doesn't seem to lock in correctly. It's very easy to pull it out.
B00KGNT4VM|1|This is not carbon fiber if that matters.
B00GZZYWDK|5|Great replacement part.  I saved $770.00 by doing this myself vs dealer.
B00M1Y3KZA|5|Great price. Love the fact it comes in a 12 pack. I don't think my fluid has ever been replaced by the previous owners. Now it shifts amazing and has never felt better.
B000C11JIY|5|We have a 2003 buick century and our window motor broke.  This was perfect and the motor seems just as strong as the original.  I would buy again if another motor breaks.
B000CSD6RE|5|good plug
B007D5QRPW|5|Despite the seller  ~(-_-~)  I love FMA!!! C: and the stickers are bad ass! Very happy with my purchase :D
B000H90XOW|5|This is a great, simple, old school charger.  Works great every time, can jump start vehicles as well.
B000C7S0Z8|5|perfect fit
B00UBIMB0I|1|Not a good experience with this product.  Spray came out &#34;milky&#34; in appearance, not clear like Mequiars that is my most used brand.  Bought Barrett-Jackson because of their automotive connection.  Very disappointed.
B004K2BH4W|5|Recently had to use this and it performed just as needed.  A little bit pricier than I had hoped, but this is exactly what I needed
B0040CTYAQ|1|Advertised as trim retainers for my model GMC but they don't work.  They are too small in diameter for the exterior trim.
B000VKZNVA|5|Excellent!
B001FIDNGO|2|didnt stay together
B00264SMYO|3|There are no straps on the front or rear of the bag. It slides back and forth under the seat. It has to be adjusted each time I want to open or close the seat. Good idea, not-so-good follow through on construction.
B00YC28OUU|5|My wife loves them in her jeep. She just complains that they are all made for one side so the jeep logos aren't uniform. Still works great though.
B0038EOS9Y|5|As advertised and would recommend. Will buy for my other vehicles.
B00XDTP2GC|1|&#34;Instructions&#34; included should not be considered instructions. Also kit does not come with a battery connector of any kind.
B00E1SKYV2|5|Excellent product and pricing.
B0002JMIEK|5|If you want your car to look new, buy it and follow the application instructions. I'm in love with this stuff! If you have a bald spot on your head and it's dull, well, here's your solution!
B007EESF52|5|Fast. Quick. Cute.
B00B2AALM4|5|Awesome item!! Gave me the lift I wanted. I would definatly buy this item again in the future.
B00HBN4K28|5|Both look great on the cars.
B00MHT8CM0|3|worked well on pontiac g6 4cycl. would be nice to have low profile socket wrench with.
B000E2AR5M|5|Quick shipping, part is as expected
B000S5VG9Q|5|This handle was a replacement for the one I lost on my boat winch. It fit right on and it doesn't have a nut, it has a clip!
B00EECLOT6|5|working fine for last 3 2 months
B013IIC85U|1|Piece of crap. Doesn't even turn my caps. I'd rather use my hands. I should've used the money I bought this with for a good car wash.
B002N5W8Q4|4|All good !
B008Y9K0OU|5|fit perfectly!
B00JIME8QS|4|It was a good purchase worked great just took forever to get here
B0002F9YHI|5|Protects and shines with a thick clear film.  Good stuff
B003TTN362|5|great mit, have been using for weeks now and is holding up great.
B000S6OE0I|4|Ready for work
B000AM8BLI|1|This will not fit 1988 Ford F150. The truck's front turn signal socket is round and called for a light bulb that is round and has pins on its side so that it can be turned and locked in. These bulbs are flat. And Amazon wants to deduct $6.50 from refund for UPS return!! Damn bulbs aren't even that much. Looks like I'm stuck with crappy non-fitting bulbs. Rather be out $4 than $7 I guess.
B00BEU2DBE|5|Must-have peace of mind when crossing the Chesapeake with my 20' center console.
B00L1S0JU6|5|Great product!! Just as described. Fast shipment
B004A2BCWY|5|a filter is a filter
B004SL8568|5|Good price and fast shipping...Thanks
B00JA396BW|1|I purchased these a few months back and the top 5 inches of the blade plastic cover has broken off. Not a fan as these were supposed to be BIFL and only switch out the blades.
B00Q1EKHK2|5|love it so cute
B005CLPE1W|5|Close enough to be OEM. Had to reuse clip from old handle.
B00EPA7CZC|4|Used for backlighting a house number sign I have that is powered by 12volt DC.
B0007XTGCI|4|Very sturdy and easy to setup.
B002OPXD58|5|Fit perfectly, good product. Fantastic customer service as well. I ordered using the wrong shipping address and they changed it for me without a problem.
B00Q5TPGA4|5|Love it!
B00MB0EX46|5|Matches perfectly with my black vehicle and personality!  It is Simple with a perfect amount of bling.
B002MQCYO0|5|works awesome
B00L4GR8AY|4|So far has worked well and a lot cheaper than other places.
B00NX7BZNS|4|good
B008VOOPW6|5|great topper
B00JLUDA84|5|I have a 10 ton dump trailer I use for wood, rocks bushes and just about anything else I need it for. I have left it at a friends house once. I have a hitch lock for it but wanted more so I got this wheel lock for it. I do not leave it out very much it is lock be hind my fence most of the time. I know locks just keep people honest if they want to steel it they will I just want to make them work harder for it and I may catch them at it.
B001KSEKB6|5|perfect match for my volvo 850 1995
B005DPNU8Q|4|I considered giving this just 3 stars but this helmet did get a lot of things right. Liner is not removable but you know that going in - not a big deal for the price point. In fact my only real complaint about this helmet is the AIR FLOW IS BASICALLY NON-EXISTANT, and the vents were my primary buying motivation. After examination it appears the holes in the EPS liner do not line up very well with the holes of the vents. I might be able to trim away the EPS a little but suspect the holes through the shell are also too small to allow as much air flow as I would like (about the diameter of a pencil eraser).  Too bad because the ergonomics and appearance is great as is the removable ear collar and visor provision.
B00ZYTR2TO|4|Awsome delivery time.super bright center light the color change two side lights is a nice touch.would have gone five stars but the 20 side lights appear to be uncovered led diodes open to weather.besides that gunna look great on my project bike.
B0025ZWZK6|5|Worked awesome!
B00GFNRG8U|5|GREAT
B0034ZNY10|1|I used this &#34;Turbo&#34; vac twice in my newer car.<br />At first the suction power was okay but after I cleaned it out and used it a second time<br />the motor burned out and stopped sucking.<br /><br />There is no warranty on this item so buyer beware.
B008HIVMMM|2|Unfortunately it seems as though the sticker had been crumpled at some point.  I'm not happy with the quality.
B0009JKI5Y|5|Used for my 2011 Subaru Impreza. Works fine.
B00KXFY5XU|2|Great concept, but didn't work well in my 2011 Pilot. Being tall rather than wide offered distracting views of the interior of the car. Would rather have had them wider than taller. Also the distortion was so bad between them and the original mirror that I couldn't adjust to them. Disappointing.
B0043DL69E|2|It would not seal my exhaust leak, then it broke, the other one, (on the opposite side) held but leaks. For the broken one.... it costs 7$ to ship to get 3 dollar refund back, or 7$ to ship to get another one, essentially paying 75% for a second one.
B00KBQBDB8|1|Pump must be assembled.  This does not create an airtight seal, so there is no suction.  Company only gave a partial refund.  Would not recommend.
B010N8XE6K|4|Super bright. Easy to install. Great upgrade to my dash.
B00JK325YC|4|Good product
B003EP52DS|1|Perfect, easy to install
B003WKO2WC|5|Very happy with this basket.  The parts were all present and it went together as it should.  Mounting brackets easily attached to my ATV.  Just perfect for taking gas cans and equipment from lake house to the dock.
B008216AGC|5|Perfect color match!<br />Easy to apply.
B008427CZ2|5|fit pervect
B0000CBIK5|4|Works just fine and I haven't had any problems with it yet. The only problem I have is that it hard to keep still even with the little metal feet things. Overall, I would recommend this item.
B004II90OM|5|I bought this from Napa Auto Parts and it made a difference. it is easy to use. you'll need a drill.
B00A14PYWE|1|Didnt work... Fell right off my pipe
B00CC303PU|2|Ive been through about 3 kits and Have had nothing but problems. They keep blowing out! Spend an extra couple bucks and get a real good set. Very disappointed. Wish I could return them and get my money back! They only get 2 stars because customer service is good. But kit sucks
B0024GR0S8|4|Ok so far
B010OTIGBG|5|Bought these for my 07 Shelby since the stock ones were burnt due the previous owner putting on a HID kit! -_- Anyways they look and fit just like the stock lamps however i had to reuse the 3 black clips from my stock lamp since the new clips wouldnt go in. Maybe all it needed was some brute force but i didnt want to risk damaging anything. Overall work and look great and got them in about 4 business days which isnt bad at all since amazon gave me an estimate of about 2 weeks for delivery.
B000C6KK3Y|5|Correct Fit. It is what it is.
B00OIABO44|5|Perfect fit...had a question about the install after I received it and customer service at East Lake came thru with a prompt answer. Solved my confusion about the install and it works perfect. I DID err on the side of caution with some of the negative blogs regarding these type of relays and replaced them with automotive ones. They certainly look identical to the included ones but I figured I'd save the originals if the replacement relays fail. All in all, an awesome price for a direct replacement to the Mercury OEM!
B00C50KI0K|5|Hilarious
B008697KXC|5|Never lost my keys with this keychain! It is very appealing and exciting to pick up and put in your pocket.
B0112SRIV2|5|Awesome sticker. Fast shipping and it was easy to apply.
B007GR503M|5|Fits and works just like the original did on my 1971 Honda CL175.  Can't speak to its longevity, but I can't see why it won't last just as long...
B004GCKY9A|5|Part fits perfect as expected. Thx
B0068ESUJ0|5|Cover looks and fits great.  No complaints on the quality of construction or material. One issue, when handlebars are locked the cover gaps to one side.  Fit cover from front to rear.
B00QK40D4I|5|Excellent
B00AMPJ3D8|5|Perfect fit & they work well.
B012TZ816I|3|Does not fit 2015 Hyundai Sonata Sport 2.0T, although Amazon product page said it would.  Had to send it back.  Otherwise, looks like a decent cabin air filter.  (Note that my Sonata has dual-zone automatic climate control.  It might fit ones that don't.  Also note that for 2015, the Sonata hybrid is the old body style, which might affect fitment.)
B005BNZ9UM|5|Very Good and sufficient for what is needed.
B007XAJV64|5|Does exactly what it claims to do. Couldn't be happier!!
B000CB4UJY|5|This work great just like the OEM but less cost, I would buy again
B000C5SG1I|5|Good quality
B000I66JEM|5|haven't had to call locksmith ever sence I got it
B006N94O5E|5|No clue why they would offer OEM tie rod ends without grease fittings from factory, from the company that built the car, replacement parts come with greasable fittings.  Now the OEM lasted nearly a quarter million miles so wasn't that bad of a decision not to use them as owners would likely have not greased and only if you request at a quick lube would they do it and then would they use the same grease?<br />Make sure you use the same type of grease each time you lube these as different types of grease do not like each other and would effectively remove the lube using the wrong product.
B007IW6ZFM|5|Fits my 08 Saturn Aura PERFECTLY.!
B0085IJVBI|5|fit and worked great eazy to put on took more time to find the caulk gun then it took to put on.
B006X98A7C|5|Works great, completely satisfied, would reorder from this vendor without hesitation.
B000BZ6VIY|5|Exact same bearing and half price
B00IBK8C2E|5|very reponsible
B004BTAJ2A|4|made of rubber ( the grip parts)fits my accord fine but it slides once in a while. I like to keep the two rubber parts exactly how the picture shows.You cant expect it to stay on and not slide by the way it fits to your steering wheel. Ideal for those who have sweaty palms like me.
B0009NUG66|5|Worked great! Used this to take my son to college. Stayed put and stored a good amount. No problems.
B0010E00T6|5|Exact fit and cheaper than local stores even after shipping.
B00GSAUHB8|5|On time delivery and perfect product. So very enjoyed the added &#34;gift&#34;. These protectors are really hard to find around my area. Does it's job and I'm cooler at my passenger seat.
B0073WEZU4|5|Does exactly what I expected. No significant loss of radio stain or increased static.
B003OXUPOQ|3|Gets 3 stars because it's a quality (5☆) product but did not fit a Promaster Diesel as specified. Gonna see if I can get a reducer so as to make it workable
B00OXMWSVA|5|I love these things they are great
B00VASXSNW|5|So far so good
B000O0MF22|5|Fit perfectly.  Shipped fast.  No BS.  Thanks!
B00FDQPCR2|5|The friends to whom this was gifted LOVE it.
B00EI6CKVE|5|Just as described.
B012UZ2JMY|5|Perfect fix works great provides excellent lighting.
B00JTXHWBY|5|car rides like a dream
B00UITN5LY|5|This fits our Kubota well and delays our having to buy a new seat as the old one is truly shot.  Happy to find this one and it arrived in a flash!
B00393NEBC|1|They lasted about 2 weeks then one of them blew up. Not worth the money
B00KD3FZKE|5|Just right...good quality
B005OAS6NE|3|Does not match the larger camo pattern which i made me sad. I believed that small and large was the size of the vinyl not the pattern. This pattern is very small great for smaller objects. Larger objects need to have a larger spread
B003CN4GDY|5|Met all expectations
B0024E6QX0|5|Works great in our RV
B00AZI11V4|2|There are no instructions at all!  Makes figuring out the pieces very difficult.
B00EQBOXHA|5|works good
B0007LZI8G|4|Just a plastic cover but does that well. Drill a small hole in the top to let air in and out or you will have difficulty putting it on and off.
B000CIAWE4|5|Excellent quality as you'd expect from LUK, best price I could find.
B005EJOQUM|1|Two of the 5 sensors arrived DOA.  No amount of troubleshooting, battery replacement, switching, or other re-homing of the sensors worked.  Did not discover the fact soon enough to just return to Amazon for refund which would have been simplest remedy (30-day window).  The Amazon vendor is no longer the same for this product, so stuck with trying to go through the primary distributor in Australia, Zylux Distribution.  So while the product is still under 1-year warranty, trying to get service on that warranty is near impossible.  Essentially I've written off the $220 cost as a bad lesson-learned. Could buy replacement sensors, but do not feel compelled to invest more into this system. The monitor itself is very small and hard to read.  Contrast controls are poor. It programs through similar routine as other TPMSs, but the instructions are poor and did not match the actual version of the device I received.  The button controls were aligned and labeled differently.  It is a Chinese product and the manual was translated to English.  I had to find a video to help decipher the actual programming routine.  I would avoid this brand and look at TireMinder or TST systems instead.
B008BLKI2U|5|Worth buying so easy to apply no troubles with the product, got very quick also
B001UC9GF2|5|Perfect fit, and it's greasable! Which is way Bette Ethan the stock ones that came on my armada. Much beefier than stock also
B00496GUC8|5|Because I am so cheap, I only bought the driver side replacement wiper!! XD anyway, this thing did the trick.  It slotted right into the old blade's holder, and wipes as if it had the force of 100 tiny squegees lined up sequentially.  Luckily instead of 100 tiny ones it is one regularly-sized strip.  F*ck rain-x and their extra expensive wipers.  I'm sure they work a bit better for a while, but let's be honest here, a wiper is something you put on once, and then you don't want to think about it again until you have to.  This thing does just as good a job as any wiper on any Cadillac, lambo, or rolls.  None of those come with rain-x so why do you think you need it?
B00DSMEL2A|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B000EVQ0O0|5|Awesome, we have 4 of them now. Works great my only complaint (lol) is that I do have to change the battery every 2-3 months!
B002QYY23Y|5|A+++++++
B0101U6OVW|5|nice
B00GYH3RAS|5|they work awesome perfect fit
B00IDSIBLG|5|Lights are bright work great
B0067UKD5Y|4|Fixed my oil pressure indicator pegged at max pressure.  Pain-free install.
B005GXQDHU|5|This is a very heavy duty cord well made as big as the one that came with my Motorhome so I have a way to get power to Motorhome my cord is 30' and new cord that I bought is 50' so a total of 80' two roof a.c. running in the California sun and no problems even at ends where they connect cord to cords and power coming and to Motorhome no heat build up so do your self a favor and spend the money and get this you won't be disappointed
B00GN7YXAW|4|Have to return does not fit my Passat or Ford Escape<br />Both car Need a 42 mm
B00DSR48NC|4|Hi
B003U53JYG|5|The product exceeded expectations and was a better quality and more of a value than that typically found at retailers.
B003S8GZ78|5|love it
B00276EWHC|5|great sevice
B0019I0AU2|5|low dusting and quiet, no squeaks so far.
B000143LHY|4|The scent is a little overwhelming, but it works great!
B008BR6UKI|5|Good quality OEM part, fit perfectly
B000CMJ1RY|3|the instruction for the installation is very poor, and the quality of the product is very regular too
B000C4087Y|3|I used to like these, but this most recent purchase of four is off to a bad start.  I cleaned the surface of the engine and properly dabbed oil on the gasket of the filter and screwed the filter on tightly with my hands as this is normally enough.  Then I started the engine and took a quick trip around the block and found the filter leaking from the gasket.  I tightened it some more, but it still leaked so then I needed a wrench to give it a final, quarter turn.  That worked, but that is when I discover that the wrench-off nut is DOME SHAPED.  It does not have squared sides, so neither a crescent wrench nor socket wrench can grab onto it.  I would up using a channel-lock pliers on the nut.  When I remove this filter at the next oil change I'll probably have to stab it with a screwdriver just like the product ad says I should never need to do.
B0013LA7ZS|4|Fit and Finish was a good match to the factory dash trim.  Had to fiddle with the mounting a little to use the OEM screw and washer (filed the washer), my only complaint is that there were no installation instructions included.  If the original had been metal, then I could have reasoned the installation from the prior one, but this was replacing a leather accent piece so there was nothing to go from. Otherwise a nice product and value for the money.
B000CRDLCU|5|Excellent OEM replacement for my Cummins 8.3 engine
B000C2Y6RY|5|Amazing quality feels solid and that saftey latch looks amazing under hood
B00VAVP0CG|5|Full setup easy for me to install inexpensive great.
B000B6KUG2|5|They were easy to put on and have increased my visibility behind my trailer.  I recommend them.
B00FC22HUM|5|Good stuff
B008Y2A0RY|5|I put these on a small trailer (4x8) that I pull behind my ATV. It holds the corners in place and really dresses up the side boards. They work very well and were easy to install.
B007QV0R7W|4|so far so good
B00MWNZ1JI|5|I never knew what good windshield wiper blades were until I got these. For the clarity they provide during the rainy season, the extra dollars are worth it. The blades contour to the windshield perfectly and leave no streak marks. They're easy to install with clear directions and easy to take off as well for when you need to replace them.
B00YBUOZI8|5|Description is dead on. Outstanding craftsmanship. Wanted a shifter that didn't blend in with the black. Easy install
B00R1P8QW6|1|I currently own a 2004 Chrysler crossfire .  The piece does not fit , I wasted $50 on a piece of plastic
B0039KPK7Q|5|Pretty big and noticeable. I get alot of compliments on it all the time. Really satisfied with it 👍
B00NTU18KY|5|Very useful with solar chargers!
B00B57UQSS|1|Awful product. Shipped with cheap velco that will not stick to the dash. Lolls like a random piece of carpet on my dash. Buyer beware
B00RU21XPM|5|Excellent product and service!
B000CN788W|5|fits great, won't wear out like the factory rubber bushings.
B000COMR00|4|Fine, as advertised.  No complaints.
B00CJHCXD4|5|They had my b16 4 door feeling like a race car at first but after a week they broke in were less bone jarring but still gave a direct fell and helped put the power to the ground, great buy im very happy if you want perfect you have to spend 300 bucks on a different set if you want your moneys worth by these
B002MB9S9O|5|Only the best
B00J0ABS5M|5|I purchased an engraved billet trailer hitch cover for my 2014 Toyota Tacoma and purchased this receiver lock as suggested.  It fits fine and locks securely.  It also has a rubber cover to protect it from the weather.  I am glad I got this.
B00VSMG4IQ|5|This is a great tool for any bimmer enthusiast, so easy to understand and it will save you a lot of money. I just plugged it into my OBDII port in my 08 528i and solved my airbag problem within 5 minutes. Dealer charge for diagnostic &#34;$195.00&#34;. I strongly recommend this product.
B001FONOSK|4|waxed my 2012 white dodge charger with the wax....it really did look good. It did NOT fill bigger nicks or the front bumper. the chip stick that comes with it was ok.
B000B8GAPK|3|Didn't last long before the gasket wore out, about a year.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great quality, fits perfectly on my windshield. Will definitely recommend to friends and family.
B00F5MCL1E|5|I got this today and had to use it even though it was sprinkling outside.  One bottle of soap and water mix was enough to cover a Crew Cab GMC Sierra.  I covered the truck in foam then just used  my washing brush (like at the car washes) to scrub it down.  The quick release for the reservoir is very easy to use making it a breeze to swith between the soap and plain water.
B0060ZB2L0|5|Excellent lights. I bought them for someone else and yhey tell me that they are very good. Bright and illuminate the road really well for as far as they need ahead.<br />Good buy
B002UC2WNO|5|Great for Extensions for the show curtains in my camper
B001PY0OMO|5|Working fine in my 2004 Toyota Prius.  Installed with help from knowledgeable friend.  Trickier to install than air or cabin filters fyi.
B0096EDVRA|5|Made well, and fits great in my Z's trunk.
B006TT46YW|5|My boyfriend loved them! He's usually really picky but this pair did the trick!
B000BQWLE6|3|Re read the size it was a lot smaller than expected
B001DUKIN0|5|Great product. Thanks
B00Y85UM7O|5|I left pretty much the same review for the side window version of this product, but I also purchased these side-door shades at the same time. I converted my car into a camper and needed a way to 1) create some more privacy and 2) block out the morning sun. This was a great, quick solution to my needs, and it was delivered timely right before my camping trip. The shade fit the side windows of my Honda Fit perfectly, and even had some excess. It's not &#34;black out&#34; dark, but I was camping in a emote location and it was exactly what I needed for my circumstances. I loved being able to roll the windows down for cross-breeze while still maintaining privacy.
B0055AZ7YY|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 scion xb.  No problems
B001O0BJUK|5|Cost less than OEM and seem to work perfectly.
B00I61AGTU|5|Slightly covers the word Texas on my plate, but otherwise a great product. I have two!
B000NSMXPY|5|REPLACES ONE I LOST
B00A9OCMXA|3|Bar is chrome plated stainless steel and had several bare spots that were not covered.Fit was good.Installation was not too painful, only a couple hours of knuckle busting. Would be better if the bar and skid plate were brushed  stainless steel  and not plated.
B005R412UG|3|I've only had to use them once so far, and they seemed to work fairly well. The process of putting them on was very difficult. One hook came backwards or inverted or something, because my step dad had to pry it off with pliers and fix it. Also, my step dad had to put them on for me because I could NOT do it myself (and I tried...). I'm a small (though mighty) female, and I did not have the strength to latch the hooks. My step dad even had trouble with them. This makes me concerned for the possibility of getting caught in a storm and having to do it myself. Be weary of these challenges when you're thinking of purchasing!
B000VKTUJG|5|This cabin filter fits 2005 Camry perfectly, removes all odors from chipmunk infestation
B00DSD7JV4|5|Great
B000NCWP3K|1|Leaks!
B00NWQ9LG8|5|Love it
B001534XCC|3|worked great
B0038L9IOW|5|Works great in '04 Chevy Trailblazer.  Well worth the cost.
B006G14FK8|5|I have used many other low amperage, maintenance chargers and seems most eventually have a negative effect on the battery, So far so good, I think this charger according to reviews, what I have read, and the interview with management on Jay Leno's garage, will work for me. As a testimony to the product I actually purchased two.
B009DJQ1BQ|5|excellent
B005CCC2P2|4|Heavy, solid, durable lock. I have a Honda CBR300RA and the pin on this lock was almost double the widest hole on the disc. Instead I have to insert it through the larger openings of the disc, leaving it vulnerable to cutting. That said, better than nothing.<br /><br />The alarm is loud. I wasn't sure if the battery was installed or if the device was working, so I opened the compartment and accidentally set the alarm off in the house (it automatically went off when I pulled the noise maker and battery compartment out of the lock). The cat was not particularly appreciative.<br /><br />On the hole, this device does exactly what it says. Make sure to measure the holes in your brakes.
B00J5421HM|5|I have the Audi A4 2015 and it fits great.  I have had individuals to ask me about the key holder and where it can be purchased.
B000GQA8DC|5|Great product.but it needs more support loops<br />Underneath so it doesn't move out of place.
B0000AY3SR|3|Ok claner
B00VVGG58I|2|not worth the price.did receive it on time,just not what wasexpecting.
B0014A2WKQ|5|Very beautiful thank you very much!
B004VG8DS0|2|The actual product itself is strong and protects well.  There are no instructions.  The problem is that it is very difficult to work with.,  The trick is to use small pieces of the material no longer than 5-6 inches and apply slowly.  if one tries to use longer pieces they become easily bound to themselves and unwanted areas.  It is also more difficult to apply this over curved surfaces or uneven surfaces for the same reason.  The product is also very overpriced for the amount of material you get for the dollar.
B00199IXHI|5|Sprayed exhaust pipe paint before installation to protect from rust especially at the welds. I believe it will help it last longer. Perfect fit.
B0048J50HM|3|This doesn't come with a motor like I thought but I didn't read the description all the way.  It installed nicely and came pretty quickly. I would probably look elsewhere to get the motor included for the same price.
B000COY3Z2|5|Worked great in my 04. Avalanche,  smooth idle better response
B00L1CMQ6C|5|Good looking shirt, maybe a tad smaller than a normal XL but still wearable.
B000BPSVV4|5|Great cover for my steering wheel, I will purchasing another for my wife's car!
B008M2FWCE|4|Well packaged and looks pretty stout. Time will tell.
B00FXWLD88|5|The got here in no time at all worked great for my utv winch
B001FCAXLS|4|I purchased this item for our rv that has an Ultimate 5th Wheel Connection. That cannot be used with a regular tripod stabilizer so I ordered this one. It is meant for a gooseneck trailer so it was too short. My husband took it to a machine shop and had some length added on to the legs. It worked out fine for us after the modification.
B002VOQ0JI|2|May be OK in very calm waters, but even with moderate waves on the lake the bag was dragged across the rocky bottom (I had filled it with large, round river rocks to capacity) and tore through in about 8 hours. And that wasn't with a PWC attached, that was with a small 1 person towable attached. Good idea but the material is too lightweight to last for very long.
B00407RTBW|1|screwed everything. spray came out like liquid. hard to make even paint. I had to throw away the fenders I painted because they were so messed up by this.
B00OTDIBGO|4|Grill kidneys were not a tight fit seem too loose for the car
B00QK7K7XC|1|Wrong size pieces, did not fit my 2015 Road Glide!
B001NZ0SP8|4|Works as expected and was easy to install for my 2012 Ford Escape.
B002XM5G70|5|I recently installed this product in my motor coach and am very pleased with it. Self priming and very quite. It is also nice you can mount the pump in any configuration. It has worked flawlessly in the short time I have had it.
B00BCRMC1U|4|Ilove the seat covers.But they were harder to put on my 2015 Focusthen I was lead to believe.They're not on correctly because they don't fit correctly.
B00XN23NQK|5|These are, in a word, AWESOME!  Exactly what I wanted for my ATV.  Extra lighting never hurts on a winding mountain trail after sundown, and these give me all the light one could ask for.  An added plus is, if you can get your ATV to the animal, then these LED's provide superior lighting for field dressing game taken at the last light of the day.<br />As always when purchasing through Amazon, I received my order very quickly.  I am very pleased yet again with my Amazon shopping experience.
B00RE6KV48|5|I received my Leather Rescue and went to work straight away...first I made my Fendi bag look like brand new.  When I saw how wonderful this product is I started pulling all my leather out of my closet!  I absolutely wholeheartedly recommend this product.  And no...I was not paid for this review.  Happy leather restoring!
B003BHR0RK|5|Took this woman 1/2 a MINUTE to figure out the mechanism.<br />SUPER! GREAT item to protect my truck and fuel investment.
B000EFOZEI|5|I had never bought wheel covers before as I never had a vehicle that used them until now. As far as I can tell these are well made and I have been using them for a while now and not had any problems with them coming loose or paint coming off after several car washes.<br />Note: another reviewer stated that these would not work on a vehicle where the original cover was held on by the lug nuts, this was not true in my case as they went on just fine. 94 accord
B00TE86YQ8|4|Pain in the behind to hook up but great product. Works like a charm.
B0075NB5RW|5|I was amazed how quickly received the part. I ordered it on Thursday afternoon and I was in my mail Monday at noon...and thats from California to Indiana. The part worked great and I am 100% satisfied. Thank you
B007TG7HVI|5|good
B00MM0OEQC|5|Dose any one have a night time picture of them working ? If so please post it
B001CF1A7O|5|As advertised. Solid shackle, completed the look of my ranch hand bumper on my F350.
B00BHLRTUA|5|Fits perfectly!
B00N6D7K38|5|They are BRIGHT.  Good price, too!
B00029WYEY|5|Great!
B004UQQMYI|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B0036U02WM|5|We actually installed this on our MSU500 Massimo.  Fits very well, and works great.  I'm not sure what all the complaints about it vibrating is all about.  Haven't had that happen at all.  For trailering we close it, and have used it on the trails open half way, and all the way.  Works very good!
B005BOQQDA|5|were perfect
B000COB8D2|5|I own a 74' k10 chevy and these (brights) worked great...so so bright and clear!
B000CIEMP4|5|fast ship and good quality
B0009IQXFO|5|works very well and after washing the cars looks shiny.
B011RZ1C1W|5|After mastering the programming sequence with my son, they worked perfectly on my 2003 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner DualCab. Couldn't be happier.
B00405U8CG|5|Great! Works awesome.
B001G4Z5J0|5|This carrier worked great for our trip. It is made well and is very easy to install - may need two people if you can't lift it on your own.  Very happy with purchase.
B00V30J86I|2|Very well made but picture is misleading. It barely goes 1 inch above my center console and does not adjust.
B0013FXUKI|5|fine
B00RA48SG2|5|Items were described accurately and came fast.
B00DSSU5B0|5|Love it!!!!! Super Cute....😉
B00HFX1Z8G|5|The mechanic said it fits and programs easily. So..there you go.
B00A6AS6LY|5|It works nice, used when I replaced the radiators on my 1994 Honda Accord and my Nissan Frontier.
B00UCKQ88Q|3|The elbow is perfect for my application needs. The clamps that came with seem to be smaller than they should be. I ended up using the bigger one for the 2.5 inlet and use a clamp i previously had for the 2.75 outlet. All in all it works as intended.
B00Y1HQ45I|5|A+
B00KTAUK3S|5|Fit perfectly on a Craftsman Eager-1 (917.373980 / Tecumseh engine) lawnmower.  At first I couldn't get the mower to start up, but a quick adjustment saved the day.<br />**Adjustment Tip**<br />Tighten the adjustment screw on the bottom of the float bowl (the screw will have a little spring around it) until it lightly bottoms out.  Once it bottoms out, back it out 1-1/2 turns.  That will get it to the point where it will start up properly.  Once it's running, you can tighten/loosen the screw until the engine is running perfectly.  There are tutorials on the internet for how to adjust a small engine carburetor, but this will get you started.
B006CSSKCO|5|Works exactly as advertised...provided you follow the instructions. If you connect the blue wire to the antenna wire instead of the amp wire it will only be powered for a few seconds when you turn on or off the stereo (you know, when the power antenna would be traveling up & down)
B008LUVZDW|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B00BK29OKE|4|Good rain suit to have on hand. It's no gortex suit but it works and fits. Careful of the zippers, they get caught in the material in both directions.
B00KTJ5BRE|5|Great product and add on to your Camco block kit, highly recommend.
B005345KYE|3|good
B006VB8JTQ|5|Ordered, shipped, received, using.  All as it should be.
B00NIKN2BS|5|Husband very happy with tire iron set.  Repaired tires to wheelbarrow and dolly.  Yay.
B005XRQ734|5|Easy to install they look great on my 09 nissan altima
B007UTPU1I|5|By far the best drop receiver hitch made. Highly recommend this to everyone. The styling and finish are flawless.
B0067UDOUU|5|Perfect fir and works great in '02 8-5 Aero.  Be sure to order drum parking brake parts kit to replace with rotors off.
B00QU6U382|3|I would have given it a 5, but the 2 pieces for the back windows do not fit properly. The description says &#34;This part is guaranteed to fit: Cadillac Escalade 2002-2006&#34; the pieces for the back window are actually to long for my 04 Escalade window. I requested replacement parts with correct size and never received them.
B00D2PLR0C|5|We use this on our boat! It works well to jump the boat when needed. Great little product!
B00B8ZIJRC|1|Don't buy this cover!! It doesn't fit my 09 Jetta. Just looking at the cover there is no way it's weather proof.
B00V9HP1Z2|4|So far so good,they were really hard to install and you can break the tabs if your not careful but I have to admit they put out a LOT of light on the road compare to others!! I would have given 5 stars but the difficult installation prevent that...
B00DUFC8ZM|5|Very nice cover works well
B00AK4KWRM|5|They arrived yesterday from Hong Kong.  I used them on my 60 mile commute this morning.  Well I am very pleased.  They really kept the legs warm.  I have a &#34;cruiser&#34; style bike with forward controls.  The angle of my legs makes the wind go up into my pants and makes for a very uncomfortable ride in cool temps.  These kept the wind out and the legs warm perfectly.  They are light and roll up for storage.  They go on and off in only a few seconds.  For the money you cant go wrong.  If they wear out I would definitely buy another pair without a doubt.
B008H31WP4|5|Yay
B008BL4W3Q|5|Came on time and well packaged. Easy to install with one of the torque tools needed included in the package. It allows my Matrix to haul my 15' long and 36&#34; wide aluminum canoe like a champ. I'm pleased with this purchase.
B0050OUWJ0|5|Very sexy vest! I LOVE it!! Worth every penny!!!
B005S8MO08|5|perfect fit. it looks like oem part.
B00F9XKP44|5|Allstar Performance Brake Line arrived quickly and worked fine!
B004QQCEO4|5|Just what we needed.
B0093N7NTG|1|Should have known by the double sided tape mounting of the module and the cheap quality wire ties ( neither of which I used) that the quality of this item was not important.  Of course I checked the ground and reset it per the directions but it just puts out 12volts but with not enough current to turn on a bulb.  I bypassed the plug to eliminate possible corrosion and even ran a separate ground wire directly from the battery to eliminate any of that but still the same result.  I recommend trying a different brand, this one is a craps shoot.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Just got it 4 days after i ordered it, no joke its a pretty badass light bar for the price. Extremely bright. Looks pretty cool in my 94 ram 3500 bumper
B00U0AA5FU|4|Fits well and secure. Looks tuff.
B00C8YXGCK|5|Works well with very little human effort.
B0024NM5T0|5|Just what I was looking for and they look and fit perfectly. Definitely get these instead of going to the local auto parts store and paying double or triple.
B00DSOUG5E|5|Great little piece of kit.  Turn up the volume on your sat nav or music player and the Sena will give you good volume even above 70mph.  Delighted with it.
B003F2BWMU|4|Decent bracket.  I did have to elongate the holes in the bracket and grind some of the sides to make it fit but was minor if you have the tools.
B000C5EAOA|5|Perfect fit
B00H699KXG|1|It sticked with car body and had trouble removing it. Left marks on all over. Won't recommend this product.
B007Y87T1O|5|Fantastic product so far. Installation in about an hour.
B00KTIE5VS|5|Easy to hook up and works like a charm.
B0016HZZ0Q|5|Easy to install. Original equipment.
B0034ZUZM6|4|Decent winch.  Would buy again.
B000GU5IH4|2|flimsy and weak material. rips easy
B00AD6RXBK|4|Quality as represented.  Very happy with purchase
B001PH5GQA|4|Perfect fitment on a 91 pajero
B00A2ER1V0|3|Expected a little better quality...
B00IH5OIVW|2|Too small for my head. I ordered the size I wear....it was uncomfortable after 30 minutes of riding.
B008B03LKC|5|Very cute, haven't put them on yet so I hope they work.
B007GB3H9C|5|Love it
B005BNP7UO|5|Looks great on the back of my truck. Love it!
B00HHGSEEE|5|This car is so very smooth and quiet now, plus we SAVED ALLOT of MONEY! It's immediately noticeable the product was very well made. Tolerances are perfect as well as materials used. We recommend 'Detroit Axle' products as it's obvious they know what they are doing and can save you money...
B00H5F2G00|5|EXCELLENT, EXACTLY WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
B004A6JA2O|5|works fine and fit
B00N9QOUH6|5|The 5 gallon bottle does not have any kind of valve or spout unlike the pictures. It also does not come with a spray bottle. A spray bottle is both clearly pictured, and listed in the description of the item. This is a little deceptive on the sellers part and should be remedied. UPDATE: After messaging the seller I was told that the product was supposed to come with the spout but no spray bottle. To remedy the situation they sent me both though. They also contacted me again after that to make sure I was happy with the product. While I'm not sure that it works quite as well as Final Touch, the seller really came through.
B002ONTBMO|5|Great quality,  bright colors
B00L84EKI0|4|Awesome
B00FQPY5PA|5|Have used this company before for replacement remotes.  Good service and clear instructions although got a quirky set that wouldn't hold on to the code.  Replaced quickly at no charge so we were good to go again.  HIGHLY recommend!!
B000K01TTQ|5|Great Lights LOOKS good.
B000C55YN6|4|I have not used, but it has very good references
B00KLEMI1Y|5|Fit perfectly and was quick and easy to install and setup. I would recommend this for anyone with a dodge truck
B006ZOGYUU|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B00IN4IHJQ|5|Perfect.
B005NLQAHS|5|Great little item..works great with torque app....highly recommend
B004FFHJ14|5|This was the only shade I could find that fit my Prius --- it is a perfect fit. The only downfall is that it doesn't get very compact and takes up a lot of space in the backseat when I roll it up.
B000XBGUZ0|5|OEM plugs at a great price
B004ME11FS|5|works as described
B003072EWW|1|I bought these Finish Factor Stripping/Refinishing gloves (orange) in size large.  I bought them at Home Depot or Lowe's locally for use in Odorless Mineral Spirits while cleaning off old mechanics ratchets and wrenches of greasy crud accumulated over many years of use.<br />After 30 minutes of use I noticed swelling and a ballooning of the fingers and size of the gloves.  The cautioning on the package warns to replace if this happens.....<br /><br />Hmmm....Stripping chemicals seem more potent than mineral spirits.......the Large size runs small also.<br /><br />These were a waste of money for me.
B00EK5D562|3|Didnt fit my jeep cherokee but its a high quality strip and looks very nice on a truck but as far as suv you are very limited would be nice if the would tell you which vehicles it works on
B000FPY72W|5|Nice finish fast shipping
B0068FU51K|5|Sleek little tool!<br /><br />I bought the T27 for my Stihl chainsaw toolkit
B00AQZBCQA|5|It was a genuine Ford locking hub for my f250. Works perfect. 1/2 auto zone price
B00GHT79Z2|5|Fit and worked perfectly. It took me about 15 minutes to pull the door panel off and install the actuator.  Connected everything and it worked in the first try.
B000GKD6VY|5|I put it in my truck on the dashboard to let it heat up then it slid right on
B000S2U49W|5|Excellent
B00J3NPOI8|5|Great, Just what I wanted!!
B002VCLF2M|4|Works great on my B$S Vanguard 18 Cub Cadet 3185.<br /><br />Looks identical to the dealer $45 unit, which I have now replaced 3 times in 200 hours. Made in Mexico
B0012FKF9S|5|work as advertised.
B00Y4GY6Z6|3|Paint on the emblem flakes off really easy
B0014BDKT2|5|I like it
B00Q64JN8E|5|Works great
B001L29CFU|5|Product fit well
B00192SK50|5|Easy to install & a perfect fit for an '02 Trailblazer LS.
B00DOZY586|5|Maintenance personnel at apt. Complex. You need this
B00XTDGUQI|5|Great product! Easy to install, very bright lights.
B005H12SZ2|4|Love the mirrors, very sturdy and plug right up to the factory harness. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the passenger mirror had a bad connection in the mirror for the turn signal, but it was a very easy fix
B00GHT8NM0|5|Works for me
B000CFUKGC|5|No real noticeable power gain but lots of turbo spool and my stock bpv now sounds like an aftermarket bov. Looks great under the hood too. That's worth it to me!
B000C5I4DI|5|Best price I found anywhere ! Being a 1997 ElDo it was not easy to find a perfect fit at a reasonable price. Fast shipping!
B00OBRCAWY|5|I love it! It looks great and fits great! At first I wasn't sure if it was going to fit, but it stretches somewhat and fits my steering wheel nicely!
B00PMLFD4U|4|Very helpfull tool if you own a BMW
B00N7BZC4S|4|Looked for a replacement everywhere, although it took a while to get, it fits the guts and works perfectly.
B00641KJSW|4|Just fine used them for cosplay
B007KOC1MO|5|good
B0085XNYE8|5|Great idea and they worked!
B00PCOT5IM|5|exactly as described, thanks!
B00BEBSR8Q|5|Excelentes
B00EVMT6A8|5|This is just the blind spot mirror I wanted after not finding what I wanted at several auto parts stores: Small, Flush, discreet, that looks like it could be standard equipment.  I don't know why all the others out there are so big, look like they were bought at the dollar store, and don't work any better than this.
B00CD7EMKW|4|Reasonable price. Prompt delivery. Good job.
B00KCQSIG0|1|Chip as
B00NG80CVK|5|Great lights that fit in our RV and does the job we needed.
B008KZKDYA|5|Showed up ahead of time, exactly what I wanted and got it for a killer price. Bravo!
B003UNCXW2|4|This timing light worked great for my vehicle. I do feel it's completely over priced. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find another manufacturer that stated they could set timing with MSD.
B002MY6ZZG|5|i just installed this have not used it yet but easy to install
B009X20EAW|4|have not needed to install it as of this time.  looks well made.i
B002Y2WIP2|5|The site said it wouldn't  fit my trailblazer  , but since it looked  identical  I  ordered it anyway, &it fit perfectly
B007EXPEBG|5|Worked perfectly,just like a factory replacement.<br />A+
B00F2JHBCY|4|This is sold as a geek squad GS-1285U UPS battery. However when I opened the UPS, there are two batteries. it took a while to figure out where to put this battery- and I still don't know if the other battery had to be replaced too. the instructions do not explain or clarify. It is working fine apparently but I don't know if this will not last since it was only one of the two batteries.
B0089LSKFY|5|I love the price.  1/2 of what the dealer sells it for.  With Honda, you HAVE to use their diff fluid, so you may as well find the best deal.  Save yourself even more money by doing the job yourself.  With hand tools that you already have you'll be done in 15 minutes.
B00J16EZA0|4|Had accidentally ordered and immediately cancelled had not realized that I had also been charged for it until after I received it haven't been to get ahold of anybody. I may get the mirror on this on and put on my quad. It does look like a pretty good quality decal.
B000CERAW0|5|Perfect direct swap....
B00GAPLVCA|5|This fits perfectly in the front drive shaft on my 2002 Wrangler, and also in the rear once a slip yoke eliminator has been installed.  Make sure before replacing this part that the pin it rides on top of is in good condition.  I have a driveshaft with a groove worn into the centering pin (the part that the spring goes into) and it will wreck new parts ASAP if given the chance.
B00FIO808C|5|Flasher works on my 2006 Wrangler LJ.  There is a slight delay after you turn off your blinker. It usually blinks one more time.  That seems to be a common issue with all of these led retrofit flashers.
B005NLQAHS|5|Shipped and worked as described. Very happy with purchase.
B009AQMLMA|4|awesome item, 3M glue not the best.
B00CTLGSZO|5|Installed on my brother's 2010 F150 SuperCrew (145&#34; wheel base). There was plenty of wiring to run the full length of the truck up to the engine bay where I pushed it through the grommet on the driver side firewall. I routed it through the left side of the dash and placed the monitor on the dash next to the driver side A-pillar. Still had a foot or so of wiring leftover. I advise ziptieing and wrapping electrical tape around all connections to protect them and prevent them from coming undone, especially the 7-pin adapter. My brother says that his has continued to work great and the proximity sensors are very accurate for items directly behind the tailgate. This unit has a better quality picture than the stock backup camera on my 2012 F150 FX4.
B000JWK61W|5|Greatly improved ride on Ford F53 RV chassis!
B0039538RK|5|Fit good.  Color matched.  More expensive than just buying from GM tho.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It fits my 2015 Nissan Leaf perfectly.  I can't believe how much cooler my car is when I use this shade.  It's a huge difference on 95°F days, which we have a lot of in Atlanta.
B00BQYCK8O|5|One side is medium while the other is fine, this is perfect for drying and polishing cars. The only downside is that it's a little big but it only seems so at first.
B005FF67ZW|5|My order came EARLY and the part works perfectly! It took exactly 10 minutes to install from start to finish and I cannot be happier. I can finally shut my damn trunk! LOL. Thanks, guys! Great service and product!!
B00HVI7426|3|They are great. I love them.
B0081KM69E|4|Nothing extravagant for an emergency warning light, but it does it's job for the price. I am using it in my rear deck and it is light weight and bright enough, especially at night.
B003175L08|4|Good replacement wind shield and less wind pressure while riding.
B0115Q1BPU|5|These plates fit our 2011 RAM 3500 Truck. Just make sure you know how many holes (2 or 4) prior to ordering.
B00QHUFUU2|5|good product.  arrived early.  great price.
B00LW6O8TA|5|Very Happy with these. They fit pretty well in a 04 Wrangler. The fronts are a little loose but as people sit in them and heat molds them more, they are turning out better. They feel pretty high quality. We went mudding a couple days after install and dried up mud was on the seats until we got home. We took a rag and water and they cleaned right up. I really like the zippable back seat to fit it to your different seat sizes. I was skeptical for these covers and am very impressed with how these turned out. Highly recommend for a highback seat like older wranglers. The seats feel more comfortable and that may be in my head but it also changed the look of the interior completely and looks better.
B004I12T42|5|Perfect
B00E5OUOCQ|4|This sunshade is pretty great at keeping the sun out and keeping my car cooler during the summer heat. My only problem with it is that it takes extra time to get it situated on my dashboard without falling.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Great product, especially for the price.  I'm wearing the yellow at night and dark tinted during summer days quite frequently and haven't had any issues with either.
B00HQZB2EU|1|Horrible, the product is not as pictured, wring color and small size.
B00CLX7PO8|5|Item as desribed
B003BZD03K|5|love this
B00IXF8K9C|4|Exactly what I needed for my 2014 Hyundai, Sonata. * UPDATE:  Recommend for the front  - they really don't fit the rear properly !!! Almost an easy fit, you can turn the wheel out of the way, the top hole matched but I had to drill a bottom hole on each but this was no big deal.  The set included smaller diameter plastic &#34;rivets&#34;, compared to the existing ones.   In order to make the guards fit the rear you need to remove the rear tire, then remove the tiny existing mud flap and strategically drill two new holes to match the frame.  I decided not to install them at this time.  Estimate 30 minutes for the front flaps, much longer for the rear.
B00OUFB52S|4|Nice lights but at night the scull isn't as bright as original lights.
B006X8BFLQ|5|Perfect fit for 2013 ford f150
B000CJ8DC6|5|fit my 1996 toyota 4runner sr5 v6 3.4. plug wires are marked for their positions and worked perfectly
B00OB0JMBI|4|I've had these for around 6 months now and bought them as replacements for my headlights.  The ballasts are amazingly tiny and fit into even my very tiny headlight compartments with no modifications.  The light is a good white color and is strong at close range.  They definitely don't carry as far as normal headlights.  I notice this the most when it is dark, but I am on a partially lit or somewhat busy road.  I find myself checking to see if the lights are on.<br /><br />Also, the ballasts do interfere with my radio and limit the ability to pick up weaker signals.  Probably not an issue for most people, but I can't keep a signal for my full 40 mile commute if the lights are on.
B003NI5IXU|5|great experience- shipped fast, install was easy with the online instructional videos available.  good service
B000ELVKI6|5|As described and the truck starts like a top now which is sooo nice after years of tough starting and replacing batteries. Really glad that I switched out the starter and it worked so well. Exact fit for my ford f450 dump truck '99.
B0067MRYDG|4|You get great reception with this
B007XUHKOY|5|Been a few weeks and performing perfect. I would recommend to order in in need of one..
B0002RNSLO|5|Great adapter, does what it was made to do.  Dust covers are a nice touch.
B0012WHBSO|5|Works well
B000CCDNSW|5|Can't beat magnaflow
B0041MGAO8|5|Replaced the factory wheel bearing hub assembly in no time.
B00J9KPZ3Y|4|Much bluer than I expected - otherwise they're OK
B00T0TYXGY|5|Wonderful product! Easy to apply and it looks great!
B000BRFQLK|4|As good as what it replaced.  These are just something as an RV owner you have to replace.  Not a rock star but does the trick.
B00GAUDGPK|5|Very nice
B00092893E|5|Item as described, the price was very good and the delivery was as indicated.
B000CPI6VI|5|Great way to be able to use other trailers than ones with the 7-way plug
B00AFDMV04|5|Fits well.  Very satisfied.
B000Q71N8K|5|Nice size for in the motorhome
B001UCD608|5|Perfect fit, and it's greasable! Which is way Bette Ethan the stock ones that came on my armada. Much beefier than stock also
B00J8NKGSG|4|Its good. But wipe and buff immediately.. else it creates white patches in car plastic
B0089OKRFM|3|Purchased this cover on August 20th, 2014 in the last month my husband has sewn back together almost every seam on the cover.  It's just coming apart and I've noticed a fuzz all over my car when I take the cover off.  I believe I'll be replacing this cover soon.  For the price it should last longer then one year.  Just so you know I live in Orange County Calif. where the weather is very nice .. no harsh seasonal weather changes here.
B004C12K88|1|Terrible product.Do NOT buy. Did not fit correctly and kept falling out of the channel. The best customer service would do is send me adhesive to keep them in place.The whole point of in channel guards is to avoid putting adhesive on my brand new vehicle.Very Dissapointed!!!
B007NZ6WMA|5|Very good
B00SHLOL72|3|I used the app. attached to the description of the item to see if this item would fit my vehicle, but it was not correct and did not fit my vehicle when I received it. I had difficulty initially contacting the seller, but once contact was established, the issue was corrected. The correct hood supports work well on my vehicle. I would recommend contacting the seller and discussing with someone what is the correct part number needed for your  specific vehicle.
B00X6DF2UQ|5|LOVE. Wish it was a little longer I have a  big SUV. Just a little short. Made well . Very pleased
B00UT2OFV4|4|They work great. They temp gauge is a little small. Very easy to install
B008900BRU|5|Solves the problem nicely and seems very well made.  The parts and hardware are good quality.  Straightforward installation.
B00211R6W6|4|Good product....have not used it a lot yet but so far so good.
B00KV7GU4C|5|work gr8 for 3 weeks so far
B00DHVODMK|5|Bought this for my husband as a gift.  He LOVED it and proceeded to immediately put it on his bike!
B007QBWCF2|1|It is not appropriate for the vehicle Dodge Caliber 2007
B001RM7VSY|5|Best product quality I have seen in a while
B004XZZDB4|4|Just what dmv wanted
B001SGBXZQ|5|Great Product!!!!
B00BOVDCPE|2|It lasted a few month but my melt due to the heat and I no longer can use it cause it melted.
B00F6B9I5G|3|What I ask, What I get. Its a simple glass mounted in a base to fit in the left mirror, does not have the convex vision to see all the angles.
B004C4YRFO|5|This works great but it is a car that has to be programed buy a dealer or locksmith just like a transponder key. It cost me $65 to get it done but worth it with the cost difference of paying $20-24 for the device elsewhere.
B002MB6QJO|5|Tell your mechanic to add it when you change p.s. fluid, conventional or synthetic
B0073W281W|2|Update** Started great. Maybe better than my long stock antenna.  But...... After a year it barely works. It's very fuzzy on nearly all stations. Wouldn't reccommend anymore. Putting my regular antenna back on :(
B00E9HCER2|1|I have had this for about 3 months now and it has a rip on the top. I thought this was going to be a sturdy cover, but I don't foresee this situation getting any better. I'm glad I waited a few months to review so that I could give a better review.<br /><br />Update: As you will see from the majority of my reviews I do not tend to complain or give negative feedback. In this case it is necessary to warn people of what to expect. As you could see from my original review it ripped fairly fast. Well a few months later it was falling off and completely useless.<br />I called because there is a one time 2 year replacement warranty. They tried to upswell me on a new one, which I understand, but it's hard to justify buying anything else from them considering how quickly this one failed. I sent them the necessary pictures and info to fulfill their policy. They processed it and said that is would cost me $46 to ship it. I reluctantly gave them my card so that they could send a new one. This was the first week of February.<br /><br />Three and a half weeks later I was surprised that I hadn't received it, so I called them. The lady called me back the next day and told me that they were on back order and it wouldn't ship until late April. You would think they would have said that before so that I could decide how to proceed. So by the time I get the replacement it will have been uncovered for about 4 months, one month more than the cover lasted.<br /><br />I really wish this would have worked out, especially since they were located in my home city, but it has been a disaster. I feel bad for the people who purchased this recently and are waiting for it to arrive. They have no idea what they are in for. Take whatever money you would have applied towards this and spend it on a better cover.
B0078SAWUA|1|Seriously low quality, dull coloring, grainy, streaky product.  Refused to provide return postage or full return (20% &#34;restocking fee&#34;).
B002X6VXL4|5|i know i have to connect the positive to the car positive,but how to connect the negative?can i connect the negative to the car negative?
B00LMJDW26|5|LOVE this sticker,  and these people at SSC are great,  the first sticker didnt arrive so they sent me a replacement sticker the day I informed them I had not received it.  Very happy,  great size................and says it all.
B000C9SOHK|1|didn't fit and threw away as it was an inexpensive part.  Was recommended on website as the part I would need for the specific engine I was searching for parts for.
B00C7Y8LGW|5|Perfect fit. Replacement was quick and easy.
B002Q907QU|5|Amazing product, could not be happier
B00N43F4R4|5|This stuff is great and even has a nice minty smell.  I had caked on 3 week old bugs on the front of my brand new truck.  With this product and a microfiber cloth they came off with ease.
B0023VB1CA|4|Prompt delivery, similar to original but not as good quality.
B003C1D0L0|1|Does not fit CL-SP
B00CHQV7CU|5|Second time I bought this cannot be more happy , nice decal looks good on both of my cars!! 😀
B009JWSAKM|5|Worked as expected.  My daughter loved the red look in her Juke. Would have liked some instructions on how to install, but we got the job done and they look great.<br />Only took about 30min to install.  Would be less now since we know how to install.
B00068XCQU|5|Use it everyday, keeps batter in our rv charged and ready to go.
B001C8C79G|5|great sevice
B001KS2PYK|5|fit just right and easy install.  works well.
B006QX8E2Q|5|Perfect. Just what I needed. Thanks
B00E8642WY|5|This is by far the coolest mustache i have ordered for my car!! Came in the color i was hoping for the seller was awesome and super friendly i will def buy and reccomend this to everyone i know money well spent!
B004CIK9MU|5|Adds safety braking power to 6.0 Ford.
B003SS62PS|3|not as powerful as I thought it
B00GZ059RI|4|Fits our truck perfectly.
B0040D2QC8|4|Serves the purpose.
B002DOME1E|4|Over-priced piece of Velcro, but it does the job. So far no issues.
B000NP1M54|5|No much else to say, works as expected.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Pull the face and silicone it! Great light for the price<br />E
B00BTGSID0|5|Got these on sale, they're a very good product. Thicker than some which is good. I'm in the cleaning business and I like to keep a few of these in my car.... for washing it or for general cleaning.<br /><br /> I'm really ticked at a different vendor offering a microfiber that shows assorted colors, but all you get is white. (Happened to me 3 times).  If the price on this were lower, I'd give it 6 stars.
B009ANV81S|5|Fantastic Product, I use it to power my onboard battery charger, love the prewired / sealed cord, made connection to the onboard battery charger a breeze.
B00K61CG5U|2|these might be ok in a reflector lamp set up but in a projector, they are TERRIBLE, I kept them a week and installed HIDS instead, SO MUCH better. My fog lights are a reflector set up so I may put them in there since it's the same size bulb but I haven't yet. The cut off on a halogen projector with these bulbs is way toof low. I installed them in a 2010 prius. Color was perfect but brightness just not there.
B00FE1XRNC|5|Fits great
B000C5HKCY|5|Works as advertised.
B002PH0E1Q|5|They  are just the right fit as described, and worked great, took about 45 minutes to install the set.
B001UEFO4C|5|Looks identical to OEM, and worked great.  easy installation.
B00L7EZOCC|1|not a very good part. Didn't fit gas tank threads
B0023WIUCS|5|Look great. Fit well.
B00MGI60RQ|3|Very bright! But may not fit the applications listed... Plug size is right, but overall bulb size is much larger then what it is supposed to replace!
B004R44HFO|4|Doesn't even come with bolts??? And wiggles a little bit. Other then that very good quality!
B001O7IF9G|4|works great!!
B002UC4XHM|5|Worked Great
B00CZDOFU6|5|I like the sticker so much I'm looking to buya lot more
B000H961YI|5|Great product
B00Y0AGCTE|5|Installed on my 2015 Toyota Camry and they look excellent. Love the low profile look. A prior customer stated the issue about the vent visors and the rear windows and I contacted the company regarding this. This was their response - my apologies; unfortunately due to curve in the back window we cannot completely follow of the window without having issues with wind noise. So apart from the fact that there will be a gap once the windows are opened, they bring a different appearance to the car. I will just make sure not to open the back windows when it will rain but otherwise, excellent product.
B000CAINEI|4|Was much larger than what was advertised...the label needs to be updated for newer cars.....if you owing a new car then I assume the standard size would be the best fit.
B00M9MSRKC|1|When this product arrived they were cracked and had rub marks from being previously installed. The product wasn't ordered &#34;used&#34;.
B00RDM2WCW|4|easy install
B00KLEMI1Y|5|The brake control and wire plug in adapter worked well. installation was very easy. Controls my trailer brakes very good. Good product.
B004FO5P1Q|5|Rok straps are amazing! So handy and durable. Highly recommend
B00027GT06|5|Successfully received in good condition.
B00RV83UUG|5|Mine didn't come with instruction's.
B00FPL2D2C|5|Perfect fit on my 2007 Mustang 4.0 V6.<br />No more coolant leaks!
B005UGGKOY|5|Always an excellent product and prompt delivery via Amazon.
B004XOR8T0|3|It'll work fine, but &#34;swivel&#34; is a bit misleading. It's not like a true swivel, tightening the nut captures the barb so if are installing it in a tight area, the hose might not have enough room to &#34;twist&#34; for the proper installation.
B000C14ZTO|1|I purchased and installed this master cylinder and had problems getting it to bleed properly. Called Dorman tech line and they had me go out and buy a bleeding tool ( I have installed many clutch master cylinders before), I did that and that made it work for a few hours and then the pedal got lower and there was air in the line again. By now since i did not install it immediately after receiving it my return window for Amazon had closed. I called Dorman tech again and they insisted that I was not bleeding it properly and would not believe their product had a problem and would not warranty it, they told me Amazon had to warranty it even though it clearly states manufacturer warranty only.. I called Amazon back and they made an exception and allowed me to send it back. Yea Amazon Boo Dorman. I bought a different less expensive brand (Centric), put it on bled it almost instantly and it is working fine still.
B00IWS9BNY|1|the top did not lock up it kept turning had to replace it again from dealership. its only a few dollars more.
B00ACXS1QU|5|Fixed my engin charging issue.  Easy to install.  Has worked for months now.
B0033I46IS|4|Fast Shipping. Item as described.
B00KG12V6E|2|I bought this to replace another sub-par cover, [[ASIN:B001MS8LJQ Classic Accessories StormPro Heavy Duty Boat Cover, Charcoal, Fits 22' - 24' L x 116&#34; W]], hoping that this would solve two major problems -- width and pooling of water. Unfortunately this cover didn't fix either.  I'll start with the PROs:  - Material appears to be sturdy and waterproof - Durable webbing straps/plastic clips to affix - Has pouches to hide plastic clips - Comes with a patch panel for cut-to-fit repairs   And then onto the cons: - Material appears to be roughly on par with other covers at much lower cost - Straps go all the way underneath the boat and around to the other side, so plan to get your knees dirty. Other models I've seen have straps that come down and loop around the trailer, which are much easier to install. - Cover isn't any wider than the one linked above. If you have a center console with a windshield and a rail around the top, it may not come down all the way on the sides. On mine, there's still about a 3&#34; gap on one side once the cover is in place. - Didn't come with even the flimsy plastic tent-pole device that the StormPro had, so there's a huge sagging area between the console and the front of the bow for water to pool  If it fits and you don't mind fighting with the straps, this will be a great cover, but for me it wasn't right, especially not at this price point.  (EDIT: this was for a Champion 20 Sea Champ with bow rail)
B00GHT6SF4|5|Worked out just fine
B008OAEXM4|1|I ordered the incorrect one and by the time my RV dealer had time to get all the items installed on my RV, they told me that I had the wrong one and they ordered the correct one .... in the mean time, 30 days had expired and I cannot return a $50+ value item ... buyer beware.
B003IS3HV0|5|Worked great
B001C6700Y|1|abs sensors don't seat deep enough to mount. Save your time buy motorcraft
B008X02JLC|5|perfect fit 2000 ford escort ...looks like as good as oem ...time will tell
B00DDXH784|5|Nice product and quick delivery
B000CQDS1K|5|Works great on bench seat pickup.
B00HV0SL94|4|This is a GREAT set for an incredibly reasonable price.<br />The only thing I don't like is that it came to me smelling like it had been doused in jet fuel.<br />I even washed all the seat covers and seat belt covers.<br />My hands stink like gas after I drive b/c of how stinky the steering wheel is.<br />Maybe if I spray it w/ Febreeze or something like that it would help???<br />But, I would still buy it again in the future. I've gotten several comments on how great this set looks in my car. :)
B006QLN9F0|3|Just received my new emblem which came with a small dent in the front face.  Didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back, so I went ahead and installed it. Otherwise, fits good.
B00BK86CQW|5|Looks good, fits right!
B00SKEDJTW|5|Arrived quick..good price..I'm happy
B001N729FS|5|This was the perfect simple solution that I was looking for.  When I leave my Jeep parked in the middle of nowhere I can now disconnect the battery and lock the hood, which makes me feel slightly better about it.  The only annoying thing is having to reset the radio settings after I disconnect/reconnect the battery, but I think I read that you can use a jumper to keep it in memory.  I'll look into that,
B003XYNDC2|4|Thought it would be a little bigger, but it's OK.
B00JY6FCKO|5|It was great untill some one else parked their volvo's in our driveway.
B001C92WWM|5|Outstanding quality and excellent. The fitment is perfect. Further  the brake in coating is good for my old rotor.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I love it 💕
B0027A5L3M|5|American built,  GREAT.
B00EUZZK5G|4|Definitely worth it for the money.  It's obviously not going to be as nice as some of the more expensive ones but it fits, looks great, and was easy to install.  My only concern is the quality of it but hopefully that won't be an issue.
B00P2D3W0A|5|I purchased this bulb to replace the OEM bulbs in my 2013 Acura RDX. They're for the stop/brake lights. These bulbs are not only made by a reputable manufacturer (Philips) but they're also DOT approved LED bulbs. I checked their functionality and they're as bright as the original bulbs and the same exact color red, but the improvement is instant ON response when pressing the brakes and added life. One word of advice: after seating them in their sockets I had to reverse them, otherwise they would not light. Apparently their orientation is important (at least in my Acura).
B00XDB18TK|4|It met my needs, no current issues to report.
B004ZF3DYG|5|Love these headlights. Much brighter and the same price if not cheaper than the ultrastars ( that typically only lasted a year)  that I was running in my truck. The install was very easy. To make it easier on yourself disconnect the bulb from the ballast when installing them.
B002M2MS6S|5|works fine mopar is the way to go
B008ZDYLC2|5|works as good as my sons snapon
B000COTHZI|5|Can't beat magnaflow
B0052SF0LO|2|Easy to install and very bright, but when all done it turns on some days and doesn't the other... Tired of messing with them and they are in bright areas
B001G5UAS0|5|Super easy install, works perfectly. The hardest part was removing the broken remains of its predecessor.  As a side note, it is a bit flimsier than the OEM version, but it doesn't appear to matter.  When installing it, it was impossible to open the hinge to test it before installing it into the car; I figured it was replacing a broken hinge, so worst case I just snap it and order another one, but once it was on the car (with better anchors holding the bottom part) it opened and closed with no issue.  Two year update: Still going strong!
B001BM7UPY|4|I installed this motor and now my driver's side window works beautifully. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't a 100% fit. I have a 1998 Nissan Sentra and I had to chip away at the plastic on the motor housing to make it fit right because the screw holes weren't aligned. But after a few minutes of that it went on and I'm having no trouble with it.
B001MQ97RI|3|Its gotta litte staple were the mop is to hold it on! wonder how long thats gonna last!!!!!  Chipper
B00PAEE57A|5|Fastest shipping from China I have ever had!<br />It took a week, that is unheard of, it usually takes 2 to 3 weeks if you are lucky.<br />Also the part works great!
B00Q3CKV0S|5|Fits nicely on our 2003 Toyota Tacoma
B00KYB9ZC4|5|Put these in my Cadillac as I live at the beach so the dolphins are a nice touch, thus far I love them, fit perfect, look perfect and so far they are wearing perfect...........
B0053SKJAK|5|Great! Fit the 50 gal drum perfect. Pumps up water quickly and effortlessly. Not too convinced with the plastic construction though, but it works just as advertised. Also used it to draw rain water off our pool cover, worked great. Nice pump for light jobs.
B00FK7QE4E|5|Looks just like it should; exactly what I wanted.
B00G4L23PY|5|Excellent product. Made in Germany. Nice white light, brighter than the GE's I was using before, not that annoying Blue Tinted, just slightly tinted.
B00GYFKGYU|5|The quality was a lot better than I expected it to be! I was very surprised at how thick it was.
B00279IFIQ|5|EASY install! Works great!!
B00RM327NG|1|Very convenient to use. I don't have to force my phone into any cell phone holder. The magnet holds well and does not drop the phone while the vehicle is moving.  Updated review after 6 months of usage - The item broke off from the pivot where the rubber grip goes into the vent. I replaced with another brand.
B000C8Y1VE|5|Perfect replacement for factory bulb
B00S5LQSJI|5|Product as described plus super fast shipping, thanks.
B000Q5RQZG|5|The item is for 4 one gallon jugs and I've purchased it twice and received all four gallon jugs each time. I'm using it for a freeze drier with a high vacuum pump so it has to be good quality oil in order to process it in a reasonable time.  It does do that and the oil lasts reasonably well for that. I really like that it's cost is so much less than buying one gallon or one quart at a time.  It arrives very quickly and comes via FedEx for me. I have to replace about a quart of oil per week with how much I'm using it. The freeze drying gets small food particles and moisture vapor absorbed from the food into the vacuum pump oil. It gets about 5 freeze dry runs per oil change or about a full 7 days for me.  I just drain about 2 tablespoons of oil after each run to remove any water drops that have formed and refill to the oil indicator fill level again and its ready for the next run.  I'm very happy with its quality and cost as well as the quick shipping time.
B00SUTHIVM|5|I just received my trunk organizer for my car and am already happy with it. It is made of quality materials, folds flat when not in use and has a lifetime warranty. It was a little pricey, but for a lifetime warranty, I think it may be worth it.
B00D7T4LX8|4|Great product! I walk without fear now. Only complaint is that the finger holes are not quite ergonomic and I almost fear I'll hurt myself when I grip it too tight. MUST ORDER THE PINK - no one would think you have a weapon in you're hands and you'd even look fashionable!
B000EDUUHQ|4|For the price should be good to keep things from flying around when driving.
B0002MSY86|5|Arrived on time and as described.  It's sand paper.
B00DBNF756|5|Very fast and effective and bundled up for secure
B001B7RS4M|5|work great. Latch could be more sturdy
B00W8KO8SA|4|Good product
B000C9U126|5|I bought this to replaces after market cap that was put on smog in test.
B000JFHNTM|5|Purchased this product (along with Uview 413010 Battery Powered, 6 LED Leak Detection Light) to diagnose a persistent oil leak on my wife's 2006 Kia Sedona. While the oil leak wasn't tremendous in volume, it had gotten everywhere and was making the job of determining the exact source of the leak quite difficult indeed.<br /><br />After placing a 1 ounce bottle of the tracer dye in the oil and driving around the neighborhood for a bit, I took a look with the detection light while wearing the yellow-colored glasses. Initially, the areas fluorescing were difficult to see. After turning out the lights in my shop, however, it was much easier to see and I was able to pinpoint the source of the leak.<br /><br />Since its initial purchase, I've been able to use this product often to help diagnose oil leaks for a number of other vehicles belonging to friends and family. For better or worse, my home shop has become the go-to place for friends and family looking to diagnose an oil leak before taking it to the shop for this purpose. Of course, the real money-saver for the DIYer is if you're willing to make the repair as well as part of the process.<br /><br />My only complaint (not related to the product) is the need to have the vehicle in the dark in order to adequately see there areas where the tracer fluid is fluorescing. There are probably stronger lights out there that would preclude this need, but for the price of the tracer fluid and the UV light, it's a small thing to have to turn off the shop lights for a bit in order to see the leak clearly.
B000CPCLE6|5|Perfect fit on my 64 Impala
B006WPQNB2|4|Nice but get full quickly and emptying it can be quite a hassle becos it is sooo heavy when either part clean water or waste is full.
B00S90VJQM|5|Interior of car looks like high noon, super bright. The front side marker bulb holder had to be opened up a little with a dremmel tool and sanding tool as the LED bulb won't fit thru hole in molding. Only a small amount of sanding is required on my 2006 VW Jetta.
B0035DLJ2M|5|100% advisable
B00J4TW2SQ|2|This is a good scooter for about a month. Then you have to start replacing everything, wiring starts to malfunction, switches will get stuck. The engine dies. And a list of stuff im sure i will add onto in the following months.
B00DNJ7RQA|5|If you like Thor or know someone who does...you can't go wrong with this. ;)
B00WFJ4O88|5|Exactly what i needed and delivery time was great
B0061MRMF2|2|Bought lamps in Nov-2014 and one of them is gone in Aug-2015. I had carefully installed lamps - i.e. wear gloves and ensure that body oils do not touch lamp surface a must for replacing halogen lamps. Original lamp had lasted 14 years and with extra brightness I expected EiKO to last less but certainly way more than 10 months. The most annoying part about blown lamp is that most likely you will not notice it. You will regret your decision to buy cheap lamp when cops flag you on Sat night returning from an evening of partying. I bought Osram H4 to replace this pair will see how long that last, but I suspect longer than 10 months!
B009T4J4Y6|5|Excellent product great price.
B000AAMY86|5|This thing is cool. Using it on a motorhome.
B00JKU60Z0|5|I love bumper stickers.  They are just fun.  I recently bought a new-to-me used van so I needed a couple bumper stickers for it.  I really like this one.
B004U00QAU|1|The product is not fixed as picture show. And there are no return free if it's consider defective. Not recommend for Odyssey 2005-10.
B004GC5DTG|5|Great product and easier than expected installation.
B002PQOIYG|5|Perfect and arrived early! Thank you!
B0018ICAMO|5|Perfect fit works great
B00TDJXJVG|5|Great price !!
B000CRO4IK|5|Great addition to my vehicle.  No longer do I have to place mixed change on a tray for everyone to see.  Has made giving exact change a snap at drive thrus.  Only downside is not knowing how much each coin you have left.
B003BZD03K|5|easy to use
B011JA8BVE|5|Holiday day shipping is received late, the quality is also good, prices are very satisfied, I want to buy again when the next opportunity.
B003NDM0QI|5|Perfect
B002RF699C|5|this one replaced a broken one,Repainted the truck .
B001F02NCW|5|Great buy, would buy again.
B00L29K7W4|5|This is the touring version for Yamaha FZ 07 2015.<br />Easy to install, just had to use a plier to correct one hole so screw fitted in.
B002X6VXL4|5|Yes. Si. Oui.  Da.
B000C1F8UE|5|Good product repaired the pump and Guage issue I was having
B00V9XRZYQ|5|The tube works fine. Good length. Unfortunately it wasn't what I needed, which was my fault.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Great for price.  I like that this includes a third shade.
B009FRG062|5|Great product, look great in my Jeep.
B0002SR88C|5|Best scraper ever! Military, heavy duty quality!! I will never need to buy another scraper ever!!
B00ZS9S1LS|5|nice
B004W5SFYW|5|Perfect replacement for the topless box on my camper.
B000CEQD5K|4|Works great but a little hard to install
B00A3LN0GW|3|Suction cups were not attached. Tried super gluing etc but no luck. Ended up throwing it away
B004K0QNRA|5|fast shipping, (beautiful helmet) item was as described
B0015CANRC|5|Works well on my town and country mini van!
B000CSWR9W|5|have used this pump on another project.......very well made with great reliability.
B004J5KY5S|4|Works great and it was as cheap here as it was anywhere.
B00EVMT6A8|5|Perfect size for a compact car.<br />I love the fact it doesn't have a frame around it.
B00BV7CK90|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B001DKT0DO|5|Super fast shipping, NICE!
B009DJVQUM|4|Nice grill
B0006I0N3U|5|identical replacement
B00IJMA8Z8|5|Solid, thick leather construction. comfortable and allows for flexiblity. A great buy for the price I have larger hands so I purchased the XL size, fits perfectly. Gloves break in after about 2 rides allowing for easy slip on/slip off
B004IV58AY|5|Worked perfectly on a 2002 Subaru Legacy GT Limited.  Able to read and clear codes.
B000GZPH1G|5|A nice inexpensive way to keep the hand from cramping.  Takes a little practice  getting used to it and working around it sometimes.  I could see if you have big hands or long fingers this might not be a great fit for you.  But i have small hands and have no issues with it when i rotate it forward while in town.  Sometimes i forget it is there and forget to use it,  but on long rides its great to have an option.
B00HXCIAEQ|5|As good as K&N but cheaper.
B00LO0M918|5|We have lived in an RV for about a year while we are are deciding what to build in the form of a house.  With every day living, normal light bulbs have burned and melted out the light fixtures.  I discovered these and WOW what a difference.  SO MUCH COOLER.  The light is more pleasing too.  I would have paid $.30 more per bulb for regular bulbs, so even the value was better!  I plan on buying another 10 pack to replace more of our bulbs.  Less heat, better light, saves the fixtures from browning out.
B00M0ZCHYA|5|You can adjust these just fine install took 30 mins. Lens is clear!
B00CGCO69G|2|Fades easy!
B00QLGKQAQ|5|Looks great on my Jeep Wrangler
B010R2JCG8|5|I had heard good things about this product from a friend of mine and  I was amazed to find a product that actually does what it says it will do.<br />I recently purchased a new car, and even though it was new, Car-Show I still made a noticeable difference in the shine and clarity of the finish.<br />But, what I really like the most about this product is that it keeps my car cleaner for a longer period of time.
B00GD4U7NC|5|For the price this is an excellent item. It's very sturdy and has a nice finish. I really like the look of it on my bike. The downsides are that if you're using a US plate you will have to modify it because the slots are not long enough to reach the holes in the plate. There is plenty of material though and I just used a Dremel to grind each slot a bit longer. Another downside is that the light is very small and not terribly bright. During the day the tail light may not be visible and the brake light, though visible, is dimmer than I would like. I still am giving it five stars because I really like the build quality, style, and price but if you are going to be regularly traveling on high traffic routes you may want auxiliary tail and brake lights.
B00OM7XZAY|5|These Rhino Racks are fantastic, it came as a complete set. No need to worry if you’re missing something!  I looked at other racks and everything came individually.  This set took the worry out of my mind! Thank you for making it a complete package!<br />2008-2015 FORD FLEX W/O RAILS Rhino-Rack USA...
B00C0Q6JUM|5|Hope I never have to use it
B003320LT2|1|Do Not Use this on Black vehicles.<br /><br />It will put more lint/stuff on than it removes.
B001879CUS|5|Great Product, Work amazing in my MR2 Spyder
B00A82A4N8|5|OUR DOGS LOIVE IT
B000TMMRI2|5|OEM & perfect
B000E8V9U8|5|Purolator has the finest element material and cleans better than any other, but in high flow situations, they tend to collapse due to the restriction. The PureONE series fixes the problem by reinforcing the insides with a metal mesh. Cleaner oil, no loss of pressure. Lasts 10,000 miles with synthetic oil.
B003CN047G|4|Only setback for this product is the difficulty to tighten the original bolts holding the riser due to the blockage of the bolt at most of the angles. You either block one of the bolt or slightly block both the bolts, making it difficult to apply good torque to secure the riser. Require some technical experience to install. Otherwise, it is a fantastic product.
B00J3D6FUE|4|Great dash cover. Close to perfect fit for my 2003 eclipse.
B004X2B9LA|5|The right passenger front shade broke because the visor does not have tape on one end.  It falls in the channel and the window will not go up.  I had to get a replacement from the manufacturer and I fixed it so it would work.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|They are everything I had hoped for. I would recommend them to anyone. Better than what I have seen in the big box stores and cheaper.
B0105VNLX6|3|It's ok haven't got the chance to use it on a engine yet but lift my cab with problems<br />Also don't come with Jack pipe only comes with ram
B00BOVDCPE|3|its ok
B00NXRXGLC|5|Blades are awesome. Fit my 2006 Corolla well.
B00YL5JMAE|5|Easy installation and looks great!
B001CF1A6U|5|AAA+++
B000FFBXCE|5|Fast shipping on a great fitting product
B0002YP7WU|4|Color is a very very light pale green. It is basically off-white with a drop of jade in it. You will hardly notice the color, so it's great if you want subtle, not as great if you're looking for more saturation of color.
B008SEM724|5|Good have no complain.. Very happy with it..
B00407V52G|2|Didn't have the same glossy color that the original paint on the car had
B008FCD976|5|Perfect fit and very useful storage.
B00P192HYC|1|good afternoon friend the product is new ? Price includes shipping
B00FDQPCR2|5|gives very adequate lite
B004IYDBOQ|4|fits great and was exactly what I needed.
B0055PD1H4|5|I have a 98 chevy truck and the general condition of all the plastic was very tired until an application of this product.  It is not for clear plastic but for all the colored plastic stuff in just about all cars made today and back then.  I would never have dreamed the color could be restored to 17 year old plastic on my truck but it came back looking almost good as new.  I will give an update on this after a few more applications and how it stands up to washing the exterior.  For now, i am very pleased with this product from Meguire's.
B00HS5I3J0|1|How great to have a complete package delivered to my door and have everything fit and work as well as these do.<br />Boy was I mistaken.  It is now four months into the use of these brakes and they are grinding and wearing into the rotors.<br />The car is becoming unsafe to drive and all Max is saying they want 60 dollars shipping when I could get a whole new set<br />for 94 dollars with free shipping.  When you guarantee a product you should stand behind it.  And you should test it before it<br />goes out the door.  I can not reccomend this product for use on vehicles that carry anything living.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Very efficent and easy to operate
B007CISU6Y|5|Great product and fairly easy to install, with my handy helper husband. Well, actually, he put it on and I was his handy helper. But I was there for every step of the way, and was involved in the installment process and we both agreed that this was a really good set. The instructions could have been a bit better, but all in all we succeeded and love the end product. We have our 33&#34; tires to go with it, and looks great with the leveling kit.<br /><br />Definitely would purchase again from Teraflex in the future.
B00GGCK6O6|4|Replaced the radiator cap on a car that had a Koyorad radiator installed but the previous owner had used a generic cap. The cap was rated for a lower pressure and was leaking coolant. Replacement cap fitted perfectly and solved coolant leak issues.
B0002ILK2C|5|fast delivery, perfect replacement for my security system
B00DQJB9K2|5|Fit perfectly and signal seems to be the same as stock antenna.
B000C73LXE|4|Does not come with brake sensor as pictured. Bolted right up to my 55 vw beetle. Was threaded correctly for my og vw bolts.
B00TZ8VUJS|5|Worked great. Fast shipping.
B00MJUAPTA|2|Make sure you have a shield to protect yourself from all dirt from the wheel..can be improved a lot if manufacture think a bit further..
B007S8M0OG|1|Nice and compact. However the product broke quickly due to poor material make up.
B00XA97452|5|Ordered the exhaust and i went and read some of the reviews on the site sold from and i had a different thought but my exhaust was received in a week from the purchase date with standard shippi g and it fit and sounds amazing i am really pleased with this exhaust!!!
B00MQ1B456|4|Everything is fine to date.
B002QAC66I|5|Good cord, great price!
B00BWNSCJA|3|Would have given this product 5 stars if I didn't have to make adjustments to make them fit factory holes (-1☆) for that. (-1☆) for overall looks small gap up close due to incorrect fitment.
B003G0KBK0|5|Very good fit and stay put with supplied anchor
B00SWI20AU|1|product looks good quality and nice but did not fit my 2002 A4 like it said in the ad,
B004P5G2GM|5|Holds cups without any tipping. Very nice product!
B001O0ZNZC|5|Bonded shoes good fit
B0002KKVIY|5|Good formula I use it every 3000 miles on a full tank of gas
B008WXL0UQ|5|Very sweet but subtle window decal. People comment on often.
B00IE117CC|5|perfect fit and comfy
B006RYVULG|5|For the price they are working perfect no defects  flawless!
B0060M5M0U|5|Awesome
B0010EB6SA|2|Does not fit my 2008 Mazda 6. Filter sticks out about a half inch so it needed to be cut for proper fitment. Otherwise, the quality of the filter is decent.
B00VKQLE80|5|The quality was just as I expected.  I plan on buying a Dr. Ben Carson Sticker soon.
B00FS9JXAQ|5|The valve cover gasket set performed as described. Installed said gasket with no leaks noted. Thank you very much.
B00S7GWNGI|3|I would have given this a 5 star review I love it so much, but i received it with three stones missing :( So I was disappointed.It looks great though, You get what you pay for I guess
B00B3BKM1M|5|Very nice stickers !!!!!!  Thank you and FOMOCO !!!!!!!!!!!
B000BYGD7E|1|Was faulty when installed.  Had to use old module until new replacement was ordered from another vendor.  Another throw away item as nobody will refund on electrical parts.
B0039WGORE|5|Best Covers I have ever used, great fit and very heavy material
B00P3FYE9A|5|I would like to see a full line of 5 pin rockers
B000B68V6I|5|Great product for a great price.
B000CF6I40|2|well all I can say is I was very excited for these window shades to come. When I got them initial inspection proved to be good. After cleaning windows I relized they shorted me on some alcohol wipes(not a big deal) then I put them on and all went well. After I was able to open the windows after 24 hrs I went to roll them back up and one of them is hitting on window. It isn't sticky enough to hold it in place so now I have to glue.
B002WB0M8K|5|Great price and fit.  Great pads so far
B000EQVYA0|5|Perfect fit
B00C7I4PGI|4|Worked well
B000IXSF42|5|We purchased this for my husband's truck as the steering wheel was starting to peel. It took a few minutes to get it on the steering wheel, but once on it fit perfectly! It is very well made and the chevy logo looks great against the black. It has stood up well with everyday use and still looks brand new.
B000WK3I98|4|very nice and looks great on our bike too
B00C01YUQ2|4|On time, worked fine.
B00550MXKA|5|Fits like a glove!!!
B00Y1HQ6J2|5|Worked great
B008DJQR3Y|5|Great product
B00EXGEBQG|4|Four star,because it did not come with the wire loop  inside but  I'm impress with it and it still fits without it. Thank you I need two more.
B0002M9GZG|5|good price
B001DRJN0C|5|Same as OEM part, less expensive
B000GKAZVI|5|This simple device looks good and saves both the car door and wall from damage. I wish I found it sooner.
B0007LZXE0|5|Really great deal and works well!
B004K8PIHI|5|Fit perfectly on 2012 Ford Escape.
B00UFERZKO|5|Perfectly sized for running a family full of electronics including a high draw workstation grade laptop for hundreds of miles. Fan is a little loud, but can be flipped off when just USB power is being drawn.
B003BL1H0M|1|Item looked good when first installed, but only lasted four months now only 20% of the bar works.. Looks like moisture is trapped inside the bar...money wasted...
B00QFY2BCK|5|Really surprised how well these wipes worked. I've tried lots of things on my headlights since coming out of a bad winter (toothpaste, abrasives, cleaning products) but none of them worked. Using the wipes took literally 1-2 minutes. I can't comment yet on how long the finish lasts, but if it lasts for even a few months, then I'd say its a worthwhile investment. Check out my pictures to see how well it worked on my headlights.
B00DTE70G6|5|I freaking love it! Crazy though, how many people ask &#34; what does it say? &#34; lol I don't know if I should laugh or cry when that happens!
B000P6WQB0|5|Great product. Compared to this product, Bondo doesn't stand a chance. Sands so smooth.
B007H2TF4Q|5|Great product and must add on to your Camco trailer block kit, highly recommend when supporting your RV is a concern.
B00II8HM1Q|5|Product is just as good for a fraction of the price.  3M tape on the back, it went on well and looks great.  Don't pay the dealership all that extra money.
B009DJK4LE|5|No complaints
B003DNFKPQ|3|Fits nicely - not quite all the way to the level of the door sill.
B00BTGSGFK|5|not much to say here, microfiber applicators with prime shipping, hard to say no
B000IG5PZQ|5|great
B00KCU39MY|4|Looks good, works good, I was hoping the cable guides were included but they are not.
B003M11HFG|5|Works as described. Pain to do but managed. Could not get power door lock actuator to release so could not pull hole unit out, but was able to replace cable with unit 80% out.
B000K02EDG|5|Great quality,fit and price!
B00JYPVGUK|4|Decent product for the price
B00UV87XZ6|5|Good lights nice blue
B00G5INWMY|5|Just bought this for the outer shell. The ring at the bottom wears out eventually. Otherwise very solid product.
B005ITZZWQ|5|Love it.
B00MGETTKU|4|Works fine if you have a Garmin with a mount that places the tabs horizontally when the unit is in the correct position.  If you have a 310xt or 910xt (not sure about the 920) with the aftermarket quick release mount adapter, you'll need to write to K-Edge to get a set of screws that allows the Garmin insert and the GoPro mount to be screwed into the same set of holes on the K-Edge mount.  Not a huge deal, but wasn't made clear to me until I contacted K-Edge. Other than than, works flawlessly. Super smooth video as compared to my other GoPro mount.
B00SVXS3A2|4|These do not fit the top holes in a 2012 Polaris ranger dump bed they are too small . but they are well built
B0014BABTY|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B0002SQYV4|5|the best if you dont like the wet look on you tires
B006BNTK1A|5|Nice, little short...
B006X8BFLQ|5|Heavy, very well made.
B0009IQYEO|2|Did not do what I expected or what label said it would do.
B00N40CORU|5|Great lights a an even greater price!
B003VAWLBC|5|Easy install. Light and simple. My father loves it. It's white so blends in well with light colored wall
B000JIFSG4|5|This one worked, 1st one did not.
B00429NKWK|5|Simply, it works well. But do not expect brand new condition as advertised and we have to have strong arms!<br /><br />My X5's head lights are now 80% of new condition.<br />I totally satisfied with this item!
B00FZ5WBXE|5|Came fast and was as advertised. Really tied together my orange beach cruiser. The orange on it is a little more burnt orange than bright orange but it's so small that the color difference is difficult to distinguish.
B00HPTLE5E|5|perfect fit
B00NAJXYQU|1|Received not the advertised sticker but one with &#34;The State of Texas&#34; on it.  Gave another as a gift, so embarrassed.
B00VVFDKU0|5|Very quick delivery.  Heavy duty packaging out of Mississippi.  Works exactly as it should.  Much cheaper than any other site I found.  For a Ford Ranger, go to http://www.rangerforum.com/threads/how-to-replace-windshield-wiper-motor.5315/ to see how to install.  If the link I listed is not allowed, go to rangerforum dot com and pick How To: Replace windshield wiper motor.  All other methods are much too hard.  One improvement over the suggested method - use some string to tie around the wiper shafts so they can't fall out of reach.  This will assist you in pulling them back through the hole.
B00F8LEB9W|5|These key fobs work perfectly.  Easy to program.  Their look and feel is solid.  Have purchased multiple times from this seller and always a great experience.
B004I0IEV0|5|arrived in good shape --fit very good.
B005JWCGU6|5|i love it.. it looks great in my car !!!
B002BVXM92|1|Did absolutely nothing for my cata on my 2001 Chrysler Sebring.
B000OZSAGW|5|Works perfectly for our Massimo MSU500
B00GHT7ZYM|5|Fast delivery.fit perfectly.2001 f350 truck
B002HJZFHK|4|The part was an exact fit but after it was installed I put five gallons of gas in the tank the gas gage went to full when should have red less than a quater. checked all of the wires out nothing wrong . seems like a faulty gage unit also fuel pump works fine. i do under stand i purchased in march but was never in stalled untill 8/17/15
B00008RW9U|5|I don't know why I waited so long to purchase the California Duster - it's been the perfect addition to keep our Airstream (outside) looking fantastic!!!  It works perfectly.  I'm incredibly picky when it comes to what gets used  on our Airstream and didn't hesitate to use this duster.  Once out of the box, I allowed the duster to settle outside for a bit as per the instructions.  It won't scratch and with the added wax (already added) it gives one amazing shine.  I'm actually looking to purchase another one for my truck - it gets pretty dusty/dirty and I would hate to use the same one for both - again, not wanting to scratch the aluminum (not that you could not). The wood handle is a nice touch, sturdy and the whole brush looks like it would last years (with proper care of course).  A definite buy !!!
B001P2F8TA|4|Awesome
B001O1L16Q|5|This adds a nice little bit of flare to the interior of my Fit. It's great.
B00LEBLI82|5|Replaced all of the old bulbs in a 32 ft toy hauler and they look great.  These LEDs are bright and a great price!
B0068FWNSS|5|Top quality
B000BZ545A|5|Quality bearing, made in the USA! I'm sure this one will last a lot longer than the cheap overseas ones.  Spend a little extra money and don't have to worry about it getting noisy before it should.  Used 2 of these to replace both front wheel bearings in a 2005 Chevy Aveo.  Use the ATD Tools 8625 Front Wheel Drive Bearing Adapter Kit also available on Amazon and replace wheel bearings without the need for a press!
B000765MHI|1|Stopped working after 2 uses
B00KTIR1ZU|5|Exactly what I needed and they have the same look and feel of the originals.  About an hour at the dealership to get them programmed and $60 in labor and that was it.
B00FW88BGA|5|Great logos....
B00MBPLPOC|5|works well for the price.  I will get again.
B008MVSUB0|1|Diamond plate came off instantly.
B00MYA6AXA|5|Tight fit quality material and a great price
B000BYD3UY|5|Works good. Old one wasn't bad just updating a bunch of stuff on an 87 Chevy van, time will tell if this one holds up
B00H2VVQNU|5|INSANELY TOUGH COATING!!!!  You're nuts to use anything else...be sure to prep the parts/frame properly by high pressure washing at car wash and then using acetone or denatured alcohol to remove any remaining grime, dirt, etc.  You'll be amazed at what else comes off after the pressure-washing.  This will allow for a solid bond of the coating to the metal/remaining paint.  Use a cheap brush as it is thick and will hold onto just about anything to brush on with..and when you are done let it dry tot he brush - it will turn into a solid piece of plastic-iron!  don;t hesitate to buy this - it's worth the $$!!!!
B00275KUFG|5|Looks great. Great purchase
B002P8OWXG|5|Fit perfect
B009OBVXSO|5|Variable speed drill and a lot of patience and it will come out looking nice. I still prefer to have it professionally done but every now and then you need to touch up a spot, this is ideal. Take your time and it will come out nice.
B005KOZ25Y|4|work good for me.
B000KOTXSQ|5|This is the mother of all and u get what u pay for.<br />Easy to move my trailer around compared to other el chepo ones.<br />Only time will tell how durable but it looks heavy duty.
B00JSCK650|4|Wish the cable was a little longer but works great
B00HIDHR94|1|BMW emblem did stick, lacking adhesive, flew off while driving. Someone needs to replace BMW sticker.
B00MX3N86A|5|Easy install and looks fantastic! Anything that protects my investment is a good idea in my book.
B002PQUB06|5|Worked for 2008 acura TSX. Good quality. Would deff recommend
B006A2J34Q|5|Tnx
B000H01NFY|5|REALLY GOOD PRODUCT
B00XH8W0MS|5|Got before I expect it, excellent!!
B007WWTP50|5|very good quality materials
B00DBEOM56|1|Cheap bulbs,my stock bulbs are brighter. Apparently these are a non returnable item.
B003S02HOQ|5|WANDERFUL
B001PNRBZ8|1|We have no power<br />On the old part some of the jack legs worked, on this there is no functioning of anything at all
B0052VVCAE|1|These are more like toy mirrors than something that can be used for safety.
B00HW58R92|5|Great product , I love it.
B00RA27JRI|5|Bask in the glory that is my new to mini cooper with a COMPLETE radio button face. This button is covered in a soft supple rubber, and fit my 06 Cooper S Perfectly. Pricey? yes, but if you need a new button this is it.
B00LBPK05S|4|Love the look and its built tough but the rattling ughhh.... Going to line the inside of the square tube the latch goes into with some plastic or rubber and see if that helps.
B004L035UW|5|great
B0050I3DC4|5|Great product, great price, a mist have for my V Strom all year round especially off road.
B000NW157M|5|Worked well. Old transmission was full of chips. Used 2 cans of this to ensure the cooler and lines were flushed prior to installing good used transmission. Learned my lesson the hard way as a teenager when I used compressed air and fried my rebuilt transmission. Will buy again in the future when doing transmission replacements.
B000GTZTFG|4|Good product
B00GSAUHB8|4|Like the one piece
B000BL2Z2Y|5|Great product for good price. Replaced tail lights of this brand on another vehicle 4 years ago. Still look brand new. Better than oem.
B00S8LVJGC|4|Good boards, very sturdy. However, the  manufacturing was sloppy -- the rear of the right hand board is about 3 inches too low, and I will eventually need to remove the mount and mill the hole to fit properly. Left side looks great.  EDIT -- Just added photos of the issue at the manufacturer's request. Should've done this originally, sorry! Please excuse the salt -- it's winter in NH! First photo shows the passenger side board, with the rear a few inches low.
B00E9FM3RK|5|Quality sticker. Love it.
B00N1E5NNQ|5|Worked as advertised.  Went on without any trouble in a few minutes.  Junt what I wanted and looks good too.
B00EFJNUJK|5|Never thought I'd be proud to display swastika,USSR Soviet and Red China flag symbol  on my car,this one did it!!!
B004JBQ44W|5|Works well
B00AYXM4DY|3|This product goes on well & looks amazing, however it never truly dries.  So when I leaned on my bumper I walked away with a greasy dirt mark on my legs.  Because it stays &#34;wet&#34;, dust & dirt collect on the parts to which it was applied.
B006WBHIF6|5|Solid
B000EDUTPO|5|Quick replacement for sink drain
B00WO8E8I6|5|Turns out mine were still good, but nice to have an extra set just in case..
B00EQ2S0N2|5|Looks great. The rench key chain to tighten the caps is a added plus. I like it.
B00GYTEDRW|5|Arrived as advertised, on time, perfect fit and saved a lot of money over the dealership cost and installation charge.  You must see the R&R videos on U-Tube to find the simplest way to do this.  Only took about 15 minutes from start to finish after watching the video.
B00SMH58N2|1|These are junk. Go with the older style with the two- four led heads in a metal case. They are much brighter and more durable.
B00RD982MO|5|Subtle yet does the trick nicely!!! Happy with this product!!!
B00KTIUG5C|5|Easy to program FAST delivery.... BEST A-+++
B00L28Z85G|5|Best product I ever use super easy to use
B00FBKW3RC|5|Item as described.  Works great on my 2015 chevy malibu
B002OSN2EC|5|Nice fit. this sunglasses do get darker with the sun, the final colour is light smoke. The trick is that they react to direct sunlight, if you use them inside your car or behind a motorcycle shiel with UV protection, or in any other situation of filtered light, the chemical in the glasses will not change the colour in a significant way. It is not a failure of the product it is just chemistry.
B00322J5F4|5|as advertised
B00C6JE2FC|5|Was able to wire up with existing wire and everything worked, Great replacement Thermostat
B003IS3HV0|3|kinda sticky. didn't take out of the weird smell form my leather products.
B0083SL82A|5|Love them
B004YXR92G|2|The baffles inside are a joke and there are not enough drain back holes the engine builder spent two hrs reworking the inside of it so it would have been cheaper to buy a $300 dollar one to start
B006ZS28PG|1|This wheel cleaner left a cloud film on my chrome rims that was a bear to rub off. I do not recommend the purchase of this item.
B00QGNMLLQ|3|I ordered this after attempting the dark smoke wrap the first time. The product quality is a medium to high range compared to its competitors however it is close to impossible to work with, without doubt you will come across wrinkles unless you have a completely flat headlight assembly. If you have the patience and a couple people to help you I could see this being a good product, a DIY turns more into a do it with 3 others...<br />Overall, I'm satisfied.
B002T5TH5I|5|Works Just the way it should.
B00IXZQCAG|1|Not a fan of the quality/fit of these. Let alone the fact that I was sent different colors and the trunk piece was actually used. I sent them back and purchased the Mopar ones off Quadratec for $30 less. Those are much higher quality and fit much better.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Good product at a great price. There is a noticeable difference in the heat inside my car when I use this! Also, it is easy to store, so 5 stars.
B000EDOSKG|5|Great product and easy to use.
B00EN20KQ0|5|Factory product, great product and fast shipping
B00SRKGVP8|4|I wish it didn't have the screws designed on top....
B000IYLFUM|5|exelente
B007XWU54E|5|Anybody have videos of the sound This exhaust makes?
B000FPY0I8|3|These rings fit but are not slotted to be able to remove without taking the mounting screws out unlike the originals.
B0000AXA6G|5|Good
B0041CDPQO|5|worked great love that i can now charge my phone or gps on my harley
B00B1ENIJO|5|Fit my 2015 RAV 4 XLE perfectly
B007KPS12C|3|The right side bracket is too close to the exhaust they should be a little higher towards the heel
B000CP86ZE|5|works
B000PLV8TG|5|WORKS FINE.
B00JPJR5DW|5|Good fit
B001AMHPNM|5|Works like a charm.  Just remember you need the correct size pole
B006MX81FA|4|The quality of the material was better than I expected,  I have a toyota Camry and the covers nicely had a snug fit which I love, I had to do a bit of tearing for my seat belt, the headrest are a bit too big but for the price you can't beat it...But at the end of the day it stills look great
B00KTHXYO8|5|Just what we needed.  Priced right!
