B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|best game ever I have been trying to play slender but I could never find a one<br />6/8 pages baby
B001UFQNF0|5.0|In one of Hollywood's Greatest Trilogies, Dr. Emmit Brown builds a Time machine out of a DMC-12, and a close friend, Marty McFly is actually the first one to test it out. This is a BEYOND Beautiful rendition of the Car from the movie, and I absolutely love Diamond Select Toys, but i have a few disclaimers. This by no means is a Toy, this is a Collectors piece, as evidenced by the insane amount of details. I know i said it wasn't a toy, but I have flown it around the living room a few times, but if you were holding it, you'd feel the same way! My second disclaimer, DO NOT WAIT TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM, if you think luck is on your side and you're going to get one for a cheap price, think again. The item is RARE, it was Limited when it came out, and soon it will be near impossible to find one that isn't $100.00 or more, if you want one, go buy the $60.00 right now, I promise that it's a good investment, and this item will definitely increase in value over time, In Package or Loose. In conclusion, I give it and the Movie it's from a 100%, It's very rare To find something of such great detail and craftsmanship. All it needs now is some Back to the Future Action Figures! Thank you Amazon.com, You've come threw for me once again.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Discs are not playing in my PS3 or my computer's BD drive. Firmware is updated on both. I'm guessing I got a first production set. Will return it. Rating is based on receiving a faulty product.<br /><br />Update: Before returning the discs after multiple times trying to play them, I used my breath to fog up the discs and wiped them with my cotton shirt, and then attempted to play them again in my PS3. That seemed to do the trick. Not sure if there was some kind of film on the discs that prevented them from being read correctly, if I have magic breath or if it was positive thinking, but the discs now work. Increasing to 4 stars due to the frustration and pain of the discs not working initially.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Pretty good for a slender game got all 8pages on first try but my heart was doing the badumbdm dance ygewhole ttime. Very creepy very fun
B007REV4YI|5.0|This DVD package is a great buy...everything played as advertised with awesome picture quality.<br />Movie itself is a must for Bond Fans!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The characters are real, and the story is very sad but joyful, i could highly recommend and would read again
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is amazing, not only is te setting and story itself one thats more than just interesting but the other does such a great job in the line of character development, description, and tensio  building.
0345803485|5.0|Take a rich man with the seriously freaky fetishes add a hot young woman in love and you get some interesting fireworks.
B00632HWOG|2.0|This app is not User friendly and its upgraded version is less improved. The aesthetics as well as the function is less adaptable.  I find it much easier to use my Iphone.
B002RI99IM|4.0|It really made me see any course of events differently. I only gave it 4 stars because the author's style isn't \\"insanely great\\".
B008IYSMLY|3.0|oh captain Adama, what happened 2 u? That gut your sporting & your nonsensical character (who nobody has recognized even though you're all over the news) is killing me. Such a better deal for the dough is Nurse Jackie or Californication, etc.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is great, but I like the first one better. I like how at the end of every hunger games book it ends with a sentence that hooks you, and that's why I read this. If you don't know what I mean,look at the last sentence of the book. It is still great, and if you are a fan of the hunger games, you must read i<br /><br />But then I think... hey, when in the first book they are talking about ALL the<br />FEELINGS in the arena, and in the second book, they don't even care about it, like it went by so fast. Then the helicopter and the deaths of the tributes and all these names to remember.. I got confused at the end.<br /><br />But is still a great book. I love you Susan Collins!! :)
1469203820|2.0|Oh my god, kill me. All of the puffed up side stories that go nowhere and the voluminous exposition that tells vs. shows drags down the narrative. Almost nothing happens. You could leave the story playing (I experienced the book via audio), go to Circle K, come  back and do a load of laundry and miss nothing--except tedium. Reader sounds a big young, but he eventually grew on me & does a deft job with the various characters. My heart went out to him trying to make all those long windy passages interesting.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I just don't get it, thought it would be fun it  is just frustrating. Can not get the point of the game.
0689835604|5.0|My son and daughter in law are readying books to grandson every day.  Hope he enjoyed the book for Valentine.
B009YG2ND8|1.0|this game is too expensive!! i can not buy it because I'm a poor guy, please drop down the price for me to buy that game, lower price is better!
B00003CXDD|5.0|I loved watching this movie over and over with my 2 sons.  We learned lines from the movie and acted along.  The lesson in tolerance and acceptance of diverse cultures was an excellent sub-theme.  It's one of my favorite movies.
B00AW28HF6|5.0|My husband must have downloaded this onto my kindle and I expected it to be a real boys book. However within pages I was sucked in and became immersed in a world I knew very little about. It is a fast pace action thriller, one that transported me round the world. It was clearly laid out and really well researched and nicely written. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Bad points - I ended up reading late into the night and was very tired the next day.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|Funny, sexy, illuminating, and thoroughly enjoyable.  The cast, acting, and script were perfect.  It's now one of my favorite movies.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|I love these movies. I think they are hilarious. It's rare to find a movie that both me and the kids are entertained by, but this is definitely one.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Very handy calculator since I always have my phone with me. The special functions are easy to use. This is the best calculator app I have found yet.
B006LSZECO|4.0|then you want them both to just go away!  Enjoyed the read, and would definitely recommend it, even though it left me unsettled.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's even better than all the hype.  If you haven't already, get caught up with Downton Abbey.  You won't be sorry.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who loves NCIS.  It's a great show.  I watch the episodes any time TV is running them.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater. I decided to rent it on Amazon to watch with my family. They absolutely loved it. The dialogues, plot, and visuals were just amazing. I would definitely reccomend watching it. One thing though, I remember one scene different from the theater. When Pi was explaining the second version of his story, the theatrical version actually displayed what he briefly said. For those who watch movies to not hear dialogues, as in my cousin's kids, the visual aid would have helped.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|At this point, what I know about it is that it allows me to bookmark pages that I want to go back to.  Adding or changing anything in what I'm reading is, at this point, not something I've wanted to do.  But, it all seems easy enough to use.  thanks!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Shirley MacLaine was a disappointment, but everyone else 'came through' just fine.  Some have criticized this third season for being too melodramatic, but I feel it was in keeping with the whole series.  Devastating end to the season.............really curious as to how 'life' unfolds in the fourth season.
B00571F26Y|4.0|An eye opening account of what has become of the food industry over the years.  It may have been a bundle of unintentional misguided steps in the earlier gmo process but has been replaced by the greed for the 'almighty dollar' and  the lies about &#34;wholesome grains&#34; such as wheat being good for us in the typical Standard American Diet.  The book points this out in too many boring details at times but a recommended read if you want to know what's being ingested into your body today via deceptive means.
B00000J2PH|5.0|good as I remembered//one of her best albums//gave as a gift and was enjoyed by one who received it as well
B007URVZJ6|5.0|With this guide, I was able to easily and quickly convert a Microsoft Word document into a professional-looking Kindle book.
1582701709|4.0|A great book to remind us it is in are head! A really postive book that does a lot of good. I saw results as soon as I put into practice.
0062014536|2.0|LOVED Delerium. Equally loved Pandemonium. This one left me slightly disappointed.<br /><br />I liked the back and forth between Hana and Lena. In fact- I kinds liked Hana's story better which I wasn't supposed to!! This is lena's story. This goes back to most dystopian trilogies. The final book is all about war. Hana's part at least broke that up a bit for me. And the fighting wasn't even that good.<br /><br />It was kinda boring to be honest. The love story could've been highlighted mord too! Don't get me wrong - I adore the final message of the book. I just wasn't satisfied. A lot more could've been done. I get it. I get Lena and her feelings with regard to Alex and Julian and how being uncured makes those feelings messy. But I don't know - all in all I expected more.
B0045DO8II|5.0|great live album from hughie and the boys. you see now why the outlaws were called the florida guitar army.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I don't get it.  Hard to master controls,  boring graphics, unclear gameplay directions (run! Ok, to where?).  I'm glad this was a Amazon Freebie... what a snoozer!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I untapped the app.  eveyghing was going well until j brought some gems and coins from Amazon then all of a sudden the game stopped working.  I had to take it off the device then re installed it and I lost EVERYTHING!!! I don't even want to play it anymore now
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a wonderful, sad story. Love is different for everyone, even for the young couple in The Pact. There was a feeling if suspense that kept me turning the pages until the end. I loved every word.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Very good game! I have a hard time putting this game down. Would like to see more track for the game.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|To all men and women serving our country with military service, retired and active, THANK YOU from a seventy year old patriot from West Texas. My recommendations along with &#34;American Sniper&#34;;  read Sean Parnell's &#34;Outlaw Platoon&#34; and Jake Tapper's &#34;The Outpost&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|For a horse trainer like myself this game is very informative. 3 out of 5 in my opinion. Thank you for this app
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is an awsome game its just a little hard to upgrade when it goes to another place but overall a pretty good game. it also works great for the kindle fire.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very good game would recommend to anyone though it can be a little tough starting off and trying to get money
B000O8OTNC|5.0|if you are thinking about buying this but cant quite decide between this and another sharpener get this!! you should already because this is like $8 and is of great quality sure its made of plastic but it won't even think about breaking unless you intend to break it, also it has a very nice diamond stone rod for serrations. A very cheap yet unregretable buy.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app it is so fun. The video inspired me to get this app and it downloaded fine and fast for me I love this game so much. It is no reason you really shouldn't get it.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|If  data are selectively not available, the data that are available are not worth much. This book documents this problem in detail and provides clear and convincing arguments that our knowledge of drug effectiveness is wanting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a good app great graphics.I think that if you want a real horse then this is the game for you it feels like you have a real horse.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Opened my eyes to running again.  And after reading and learning about barefoot Ted, ran 2km barefoot with no knee pain.  I hope I can continue to run pain free this coming summer.  Good read, hard to put down.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|easy to lose yourself for hours in this amazing game. the multiple choices of game patterns and diffi ulty make this game unique and special.
0670024813|2.0|I enjoyed \\"Guns,Germs and Steel...\\" but this book is very disappointing. Many sections are boring and slow to get to the point.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Well I got the book only 6 days ago and I have to say it's really addicting. I give this book 5 starts cause it will exceed your mark or expectations of a Rick Riordan book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love reading and while on my trip to our honeymoon this book kept me intrigued in its plot instead of the plane ride.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was truly one of those you want to read cover to cover!  I cannot wait to see the movie!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so much fun I could play it all day with the different people you can unlock and the boards you get its just so adddicting love it! !!!!!!!=]<br /><br />Just kidding just hurts<br /><br />Pass it on
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Could not put any of the three in this trilogy down, a must read even if it is geared more for a young adult. If we do not learn from our mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them, something that humanity has yet to learn. Only grip is the ending was a bit weak, wished for more flare or a twist like in the rest of the series. Kind of disappointing.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Travel to far off places. High Jinks comes calling.  Capt. Mel and crew each have a story of their on to tel.  All are good hearted.  Discovering many different places.  The adventures never stop.  There's laughter.  Love. Terror.  Sorrow. All wrapped into this loose knit group that give the viewed everything and more.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|I cant find my only person I watch (AndrewArcade) on livestreams and its just pathetic don't get it on kindle fire. Only reason its getting two stars is because its free
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love the epicness of it all, the depth the characters are developed to, and the attention to detail. Not just another story of good versus evil - there are lots of shades of grey which makes it very interesting. And there are dragons! :)
B00785P2QC|5.0|Rusty ty ty tytyty though rhythm police young baby EpisOdE TyLEr Bonaventure<br />Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go just doing this for that challenge
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very user friendly. I have this app on my iphone. I would definitely recommend this app, to friends and family
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel was great; plot was exciting and tragic. Definitely worth the money to rent. May have been more exciting on the big screen.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Like many others, I've been on many diets throughout my life - When I reached a new high nearly a year ago, I decided a lifestyle change was needed. I started eating a more healthy diet, with more fruits and nuts and smaller portions. This worked well to a point, but I found myself relaxing the diet by starting to eat more snacks (mostly carbs). Even though my weight did not increase, I was stuck at a plateau - a well worn path.<br /><br />After reading The New Atkins, I learned that carbs were the problem and that by keeping those to a minimum and adding fats, notably olive oil, fish, meats and more/better nuts, I could feel satisfied and still lose weight (I've dropped another 10 pounds in the last few weeks)! Most important, Atkins provides the &#34;recipe&#34; for maintaining my weight - the new lifestyle (once I reach my goal) while not having to give up good, satisfying food.<br /><br />A 6-year study was recently published comparing 3 diets - Mediterranean diets with a) olive oil, b) nuts vs. c) low-fat diet. The first diet (olive oil) was hands-down the best in reducing heart disease, followed closely by the one that emphasized nuts. The low-fat diet was a real loser. The Mediterranean and Atkins diets seem very similar in some ways, so if was a great endorsement of my new Atkins lifestyle. (There's a key difference between the two, as I read it: the &#34;Atkins Edge&#34; - somewhat poorly defined in the book, I think - meaning the body's adaptation to burning body fat vs. sugars. This is especially important to type-2 diabetics and long-term weight loss).<br /><br />There
B006HL9G10|5.0|Really a fabulous timer app--the flexibility is amazing, so this app can be used for many timing purposes other than meditation--but it's an EXCELLENT meditation app!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|other than the fact that when u run out of lives u have to pay for them this game is pretty good. never played this type of game and had to pay for lives. that's crazy!
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Confused and disorganized  - In my opiniion noone should waste time watching this movie.  Better to re-read a good book.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  Lindsey Stirling is a great talent. I have watched many of her videos and her music is truly a joy to listen to.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|I think this is the best Mel Gibson movie ever! His portrayal of William Wallace, the leader of the leader of the revolution to run the British out of Scotland, is absolutely convincing! The entire cast is outstanding in the portrayal of their characters, especially, Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks. Epic battle scenes, a great story, and beautiful settings, make this one of my favorite movies!
B007X76Y58|5.0|I've been a big Dave Gahan/Depeche Mode fan for many years.  I've always loved his voice and it's awesome on this album.  I enjoyed this and also his solo albums that offer something a little different than the Depeche Mode sound.  If you're a fan, you'll love this!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great read, the story of a worldwide disaster that changes all nations and people as told from the first hand stories and memories of those tha lived it and suffered through it. From a stand point of human nature and how different people cope or don't cope when faced with a challenge or just the need to survive, I found the stories fascinating and believeable. The stories portray the best and worst of human beings.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Riveting!!  Didn't want to stop reading it.  Felt a tremendous sense of loss for this brave warrior and tremendous sympathy for the family and friends he left behind.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Good action and special effects. Really loved the humor inserted pertaining to their other action movies.  It was hard seeing Van Damme as the bad guy.
B004Y042N8|2.0|This is lame! My son is 7 and likes to draw. This app is going to make him rethink art.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I loved it as I do all of her writings. She's the best writer of our times and maybe the best of short stories ever!
B00122MWBK|5.0|😀  💛 💛 💛 💛 💛love the group and songs. 💛 💛 💛 💛 💛 💛 💛 💛 💛 💛💛
B009FZHYKU|5.0|it has it all: suspence, drama, horror, romance, crime, action-adventure, disaster, thriller.... all in one show. What`s not to love!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|The third MI restored my faith in the series and Tom Cruise in general. This one, the fourth, is the best of the lot and not only lets Cruise shine in some amazing, chair gripping stunts, but introduces some new agents (Jeremy Renner) that I'm hoping make it to a fifth film.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzel, again proves he is an excellent actor. one of the best movies seen this year. Can't wait until his next release.
B004UXY5D6|5.0|Every track has its own uniqueness but the album together flows great.  First album from Whiskey Myers I've bought but definitely won't be the last.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Many functions i can use which is for special areas. They are very professional. By the way, its UI is comfortable for me
0684859106|4.0|Cook book was in great condition, was shipped pretty timely. The recipes in the cookbook were a little less than I expected, but all in all I still like it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|If you compare this to the classic and very overpriced JP Operation Genesis you'll be disappointed. The only similarity is that you build a park. Everything else is different.<br /><br />Some negatives. First you hear sounds of dinosaurs that aren't even there yet. Ofcourse the major negatives is doesnt have what OG has and like in all other app games you need money to do things. You can either earn the money or buy it with real money. Nothing major though.<br /><br />Positives. All the characters from Jurassic Park film are in it. Also if you dont want to wait 30 minutes for your items to refill just leave the app and go back in.<br /><br />On its own it is a good app. Im glad they made it. I was not about to spend the $30-$80 for the OG on my regular xbox
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is much like Jewel Quest. I like the different choices of games and that I can go back and improve my previous score.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like this Alarm clock because it is easy to use.  It works great it even has a snooze alarm.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am a list maker and this notepad is great for that. I even get to see my items crossed off as I complete them!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The information is just great.  It is also fun to see the weather for other parts of the country.  I have family members from all over.
1400032717|1.0|Hated it. My sense of humor must be different than this strange book. Nothing enjoyable about it. I struggled through the book. Have read it, don't have to do that again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i have always liked subway surfers and now in rome<br />Awesome!!!!!!!  it makes me want to just jave fun and when i die i feel like dang it -i missed.
068484267X|1.0|The writing is beautiful. He is a wonderful author. BUT; if I read one more page of the father drinking the dole money, the evil Catholic nuns, putting cardboard in shoes, I thought I would scream.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|after watching season 1...i had to know more about this regal family and their staff...this show will hook you in fast. but well worth it....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really loved the first Temple Run game,so I didn't hesitate in getting the second one. And I'm not regretting the choice at all! Temple Run 2 is much much better than the first one. It's a lot more interactive and its a little more entertaining than the first version. Get it and see for yourself! You'll love it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|i watched season 1 at a friends request...got to know the family and staff of downton abbey..had to get season 2...still just as interesting as before....so while walking thru walmart the day after finishing season 2...i find season 3..last one on the shelf.....i grab it just as another lady walks up...was that downton? i said yes... i just verily got it...point is..this drama is sooooo good even local stores cant keep them on the shelf...i was sad in the turns this season took...but i am still looking forward to DOWNTON ABBEY season 4 !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This entire series was amazing I loved each book more than the last I can't wait for the next movies to come out!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A must read . Tells how the sniper is trained, lives & why. So sad that he died before his time.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is awesome but on kindle fire you get to play it for a long time then like 5-10 times you play and go back home and want to play it again it loads with the &quot;I&quot; thing and then it  goes home automaticly and will not take you to the place were it says play. so It apparently wont load up on kindle fire and I have to delete the app and go and re download it and it starts all over and wont save your progress. I had 11 gems to save me and 12,000 coins and didn't save any. I think that's not right and so far Ive had to delete the app 4 times and redownload.  its kind of sad all the progress you've done and u just loose it. oh well. :(
B009POCG0Y|4.0|If dark, violent, very black comedies are not your cup of tea, you'll want to stay away from this.  But this very well-written, well directed,  very adult film is top notch William Freidkin,  though not up to the perfection of The French Connection and The Exorcist.  It's almost there,  with just one or two missteps.  You'll leave the film feeling slimy, but the film is set amongst trailer trash.<br /><br /> The cast is great, Matthew McConaughey shines.  It was fun filmmaking and fun watching.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Father-daughter drama, with hints of the challenges of aging.  A little contrived ending, but the acting was great!  And if you love baseball stories, you will like this one.
B0086700CM|1.0|It doesn't work. It didn't feel my finger swipe. I never even got to get through the beginning instructions.  Awful game. Dont buy it.
B00BHU261S|3.0|With such talent, I expected more.  Interesting view of the inside goings on in Hollywood.  Nice slice of a time in Hitch's life, but I was distracted by Hopkins' poor imitation of Hitch.  The guy who played Anthony Perkins however was a doppleganger!  Hopkins was better at Nixon!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Loved this movie cant wait till next James Bond film with Daniel Craig comes out.  He played the character of James Bond to perfection. He is now my favorite James Bond.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Acting was good but the storyline repulsive.  If based on reality, very pathetic!  I could find no redeeming value for making the film except to discredit the person it was based on.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|What's this game all about, wander aimlessly about using silly tap and steer which means you have your finger in the way of where you are going, just to collect silly notes for some reason. And then silly man come up and your dead ???' I'm glad this was free as I would not be happy if I'd paid for it it. .
B0041D843M|5.0|I will be 66 years old in a month's time and have a lot of my health indicators just south of the borderline levels. I have tried putting off taking any medication that many friends and relatives have been taking for years simply because I do not want to be drug dependent. My daughter in law who has been a vegetarian and organic food devotee gave me this book last Christmas.<br /><br />It is one of the best gifts I have ever received from anyone.<br /><br />This is one of the few times that I have read non-fiction and continued on to finish it. The author's arguments for his case are so strong and backed up by facts and many studies, both in laboratories and actual case histories, that it would be insane not to follow his recommendations and modify our eating habits. Perhaps the biggest leap of faith one has to take is the extrapolation of lab studies that use whey as the animal protein diet component to ALL animal protein.<br /><br />I for one, have started modifying my diet but I do not intend to go to the other extreme of going vegan. Drastically cut red meat, fats, and dairy products in favor of grains, cereals, greens and fruits-- yes, but to forsake forever the pleasure of a capuccino or a Brazilian rodizio once in a while would also take a lot of zing from life. So far I have lost close to 8 lbs. from the Christmas holiday feasting without going hungry. My aim is also to lower my cholesterol  from  209 in January to 175 by June this year. If I succeed, I will spread the word among my family and friends to read the book and change their lifestyle and eating habits also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game,I didn't like playing any other games as much I do this one.I wish I was able to log in facebook like I used to.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It was suggested that I download it and I'm glad I did.  It's very informative.  Better than watching TV  I would recommend it.
0525952926|5.0|Can't wait for the next book - 2014 is long to wait - really like the way Follet remiinds you of the characters along the way
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Great movie for anyone to enjoy! It's touching, entertaining, silly,sweet and funny! There is also wonderful music playing throughout the movie.
0525951652|5.0|Absolutely wonderful - cannot believe how much I learned - First time i have read a book by Follett - but not my last
B009GED3HS|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is a very entertaining and often relatable show. It has both funny and sweet moments and can be enjoyed by a wide range of audiences. Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This an awesome game! Anyone who loves horses will love this game. I gave it four stars because it does glitch sometimes but otherwise its awesome! Watch out for ads.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was hesitant to watch at first because I don't like gory shows/movies however it is so much more than that! The show does have its gross parts but they are balanced out by the characters and events that surround them. I highly recommend this show!

B004EJUMT2|5.0|I bought Ghost's debut album \\"Opus Eponymous\\" just a couple months ago, and I must say, it is just absolutely awesome beyond words, there's really no other words to describe it. I love it so much, I've had it spinning in rotation ever since I first bought it. For some of those that don't know, Ghost are a heavy metal outfit from the great European country of Sweden, consisting of six anonymous members with five of them (two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist, and a drummer) being all dressed up in black hooded cloaks, while hiding their faces, referring themselves as the \\"Nameless Ghouls\\", and their frontman/vocalist known as Papa Emeritus is all decked out like a Satanic arch bishop type Pope. They all play a very fresh and unique blend of 70's style heavy/doom metal with some psychedelic rock influences thrown in the mix as well, and of course lyrical themes that deal with Demons, Occultism, and Satanism which I don't even take seriously whatsoever. Musically, Ghost's influences range variously from the likes of Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, Angel Witch, Witchfinder General, and Mercyful Fate. This album is just jam packed with catchy, hard edged, driving guitar riffs, hot piping keyboard effects, memorable sing along choruses, and superb clean singing vocals throughout. \\"Opus Eponymous\\" starts off with a short funeral like organ sounding instrumetal \\"Deus Culpa\\" which then blasts right into \\"Con Clavi Con Dio\\" which begins with a catchy, chugging bass line that shifts into a marching drum beat that will have you bobbing your head in unison, and then the clean vocals and hard driving guitars come into play. \\"Ritual\\" is without question the best song on the album hands down. This song features a batch of catchy riffing including a great 70's Classic Rock inspired melodic guitar intro and an awesome memorable clean sung chorus, and it's definately the best chorus on the whole album I might add. Other standouts on here include \\"Elizabeth\\" which is an awesome, catchy melodic headbanger reminiscent of early Mercyful Fate, as well as \\"Stand By Him\\", \\"Satan Prayer\\", \\"Death Knell\\" (which features soaring choruses, as well as some atmospheric keyboard and bell sounds), \\"Prime Mover\\", and of course the closing instrumental \\"Genesis\\" which has an old school video game soundtrack vibe to it. To me, this whole album works so well like almost a conceptual music score, it would fit so perfectly to an eerie late seventies horror film. Bottom line, \\"Opus Eponymous\\" is one album that'll steal your soul on the first listen, and make you keep on coming back for more. It is just simply awesome from beginning to end, and it's definately a huge breath of fresh air in today's modern metal for sure...I highly recommend this album, and be sure to check out their new upcoming album under the name Ghost B.C. \\"Infestissumam\\" which comes out on April 9th!!!<br /><br />HORNS UP!!!tchy melodic headbanger reminiscent of early Mercyful Fate, as well as \\"Stand By Him\\", \\"Satan Prayer\\", \\"Death Knell\\" (which features soaring choruses, as well as some atmospheric keyboard and bell sounds), \\"Prime Mover\\", and of course the closing instrumental \\"Genesis\\" which has an old school video game soundtrack vibe to it.

0812993292|5.0|Harold Fry is a sixty-five year old retired Sales Rep, who worked in a brewery.  He is married to Maureen and lives in a small English Village named Kingsbridge, South Hams.  They have a son, David, who is away at school.<br /><br />Harold's childhood was a sad one.  His mother left his father and Harold, when he was only thirteen years old.  Her reason for leaving was that she wasn't meant to be a mother, and a child was the last thing she wanted and needed.  Harold learned quickly that the best way to get along was to keep a low profile.  At the age of sixteen, Harold's father told him to leave.  One night he met Maureen at a dance and they fell madly in love and married.<br /><br />On an ordinary morning in mid-April, Harold receives a letter from Queenie Hennessy, who is in a Hospice in Berwick-Upon-Tweed.  She is writing to say goodbye.  She has cancer and is dying.  Queenie worked at the Brewery years ago in the Finance Department.  Harold quickly answers and tells Maureen that he's going to mail the letter.  On the way, he sees his neighbour Rex and tells him too that he's on his way to the mailbox.  After walking and not thinking, he passes the mailbox and so, he continues his walk to the next one.  He stops at a garage convenience store to get something to eat and the girl at the counter starts talking to him.  Harold tells her he has a friend who has cancer.  She then tells him the story about her Aunt who had cancer.  She tells Harold that science hasn't got all the answers and he has to believe a person can get better.  A person has to have faith.<br /><br />He thinks about it and decides he is going to walk to see Queenie.  He calls the Hospice and tells the nurse to tell Queenie he's on his way to see her and she must keep living.  Harold has six hundred twenty-seven miles to walk to Berwick-Upon-Tweed.  He hasn't the proper walking shoes or the clothes.  He's wearing his yachting shoes..  He calls Maureen and tells her his plan.  She is in shock and feels he'll never return.  Harold is not in shape for this tough journey, but Queenie had done him a great favour and he has never thanked her for it.  Off he goes, putting one foot in front of the other and he is on a pilgrimage.  At each village he picks up souvenirs for Maureen and Queenie.  For Maureen, the souvenirs are usually pens and for Queenie. a beret and other things that he thinks she would like.  He also mails them postcards as well.<br /><br />In the meantime, Maureen is reflecting on their marriage.  They haven't been sleeping in the same room and that has got to change.  They haven't been talking together and they haven't really been too happy.  She feels that she has to make some changes for their marriage to last.  Their neighbour Rex hasn't seen Harold for a few days and Maureen had told him Harold had sprained his ankle and is in bed.  One day, Maureen decides to tell Rex the truth.  Rex's wife has died and he too is lonely.  Maureen doesn't know what she'll do without Harold.  She feels so alone.  She speaks to her son David.  David hasn't seen his father in twenty years.<br /><br />Along the way, Harold meets up with quirky and colourful characters.  He has a hard time walking.  He has blisters on his feet and has cramps in his legs.  His yachting shoes are not for walking and he is exhausted.  He has met an actor who is willing to have his chauffeur drive him to the Hostel, but Harold refuses.  Can he continue on his walk to see Queenie?  Is Queenie alive?  Does he return home to Maureen?  Can his relationship with his son, David, improve?<br /><br />This book makes us think about our childhood, dating, married life, regrets, loneliness and death.<br /><br />I was amazed to learn that this was Rachel Joyce's first novel.<br />The writing is original, vibrant and full of heart.<br /><br />Her background has been in performing in leading roles for the Royal Shakespeare Company combined with writing plays for the BBC Radio.<br /><br />This is anoutstanding novel that merits 5 STARS.  I highly recommend it.outstanding novel that merits 5 STARS.  I highly recommend it.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|I just went to see Silver Linings Playbook in theaters yesterday and I found it to be a fabulous movie. You don't go to many rated R movies where there is a great storyline that doesn't include sex. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and the rest of the cast is great. It was funny yet emotional and very well written. I haven't been to a movie in awhile where I forgot I came with someone because I was so focused on the film. (I go to the movies about every other week) I saw most of the nominated films this year and this was the best in its genre. Loved it!
0525952926|3.0|For its genre it's OK, slightly worse than the first part of the series (Fall of Giants). I was interested in seeing where Follett would go with his set-up; and cared enough about the characters to want to see what happened to them. For World War II novels of this type (huge cast of characters, taking place in different countries) it is inferior to Herman Wouk's  &#34;Winds of War&#34; and &#34;War and Rememberance&#34;. A previous reviewer said that what he disliked about it was that all the characters are now mostly rich and important ( no more coal miners or factory workers). I agree with that. If you want a novel that shows more ordinary people across the world in the second World War,  would really recommend. Marge Piercy's  &#34;Gone to Soldiers&#34;, an excellent novel.<br /><br />So, this was OK. It passed the time and since I got it for a present for my husband (he liked it a bit more than I did, but  also thought it not as good as Fall of Giants and didn't like either as much as the one about building the cathedral.

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book right here has proven to me that the Amazon rating system is irretrievably corrupt and broken, and cannot be trusted.  There is no way this book deserves this many 5 star reviews.  The only explanation I can come up with is that the author has paid huge bucks to an online reputation management company, essentially buying votes.  Either that, or maybe she belongs to a mega-church which has somehow convinced legions of true believers that a good review for this book gets them one step closer to heaven.  CERTAINLY there can be no discerning readers who actually LIKED this utter piece of garbage.  Even your average teenager is able to recognize rubbish when they read it.<br /><br />There are an astonishing number of things wrong with this book.  I'll start with those that are not spoilers:<br /><br />1.  The writing is unspeakably poor, and it appears to have not received even a glance by an editor.  Terrible grammar, twisted syntax, endlessly repeated words, mind-numbingly boring descriptions of trivialities and nonsense, stilted dialogue...some of the worst writing I've ever seen outside of a fifth-grade classroom.<br /><br />2.  At many points the pace is achingly slow, with bloated passages wasted on exhaustive but incomprehensible recounting of Holder's minor body movements.  He touches her lips, brushes away a tear, moves his hand to her neck, grabs her elbow, leans down to kiss the top of her head, rolls to the side, bends his wrist, moves his leg, brushes her cheek...for pete's sake, a single change in position can take up half a page!  And you STILL can't picture what or how he's actually moving, because none of it gels into anything that you can envision.  He's like a jerky marionette on silly-string with limbs flying helter-skelter.<br /><br />3.  At other points the pace is ridiculously fast, giving short shrift to pivotal moments.  Key events blast by so quick, with little scene-setting or description...just a vomit of exposition with no real visuals.  (A scene with the father comes to mind - more on that later.)<br /><br />4.  The characters are absurdly unbelievable.  The Holder boy in particular - as a parent of a young man about that age, I can assure you there isn't a single 18-yr-old boy in human history who has EVER acted or talked that way.  Oh, maybe in some Harlequin-romance-addicted girl's fantasies, but not on Planet Earth.  Try reading some of his dialogue out loud, and just try to imagine a single teenage boy you've ever met in your life saying it.  Most of his dialogue comes across as the most overwrought, insipid drivel ever written.<br /><br />5.  Some characters are completely unnecessary.  Example:  clearly the sole purpose of Six is to give protagonist Sky an opportunity early in the book to spout ostensibly clever, hip teen-speak, establishing her as a sarcastic teenage anti-hero.  The rest of the players are superficial, undeveloped caricatures.<br /><br />6.  The obsession with kissing is just stupid.  I'm sorry but as shallow and boy-crazy as teenage girls can be, I assure you they don't spend EVERY waking moment fixated on kissing.  It seems this book is to trying to emulate a YA book (at least until the alarming plot points later on, which are completely inappropriate), and yes there is a market for that...but even the worst YA book is ten times more readable than this tripe.<br /><br />And those are by no means the worst transgressions.  Not by a long shot.<br /><br />***HERE BE SPOILERS***<br /><br />The biggest crime of this book is the reckless way in which it deals with a serious issue:  childhood sexual abuse.  First, let me say how tired I am of the clich&eacute; of every story about a troubled woman ending up with the unsurprising revelation that her troubles all stem from having been sexually abused by her own father.  Really?  Couldn't come up with anything just a little bit more original?<br /><br />But worse than that is the way Sky deals with her abuse.  I shudder to think that some young girl out there with REAL abuse issues will think that all she needs to heal is a smoldering bad boy who wants nothing more than to get in her pants. Yeah, that's the way to heal from sexual assault: find yourself a moody bad-boy and let him ravish you.  Talk about a cycle of abuse!<br /><br />What Sky clearly needs is a competent therapist, not some creepy, emotionally unstable young man who comes dangerously close to obsessive stalking and thinks nothing of stealing a 17-yr-old girl's virginity...mere moments after watching her own father shoot himself in the head!  The sex scene is one of the most disturbing things I've ever read, coming immediately after picking pieces of the girl's father's BRAIN MATTER out of each other's hair.  If that was real, that boy should be arrested, not applauded.<br /><br />Which brings up the most upsetting scene - the father's suicide.  This is one of the least believable moments in the entire book.  What a cop-out!  Clearly Hoover needed an expedient way to get the evil dad out of the picture with a minimum of fuss.  And it's written so sloppily, tacked on almost as an afterthought just to get it done. And their reactions - the girl just watched her father kill himself, and she immediately goes back to a hotel room and has sex?  How sick is that?  That's supposed to be HEALING?  Ask a therapist what they think.  The supposed reasoning behind this twisted behavior is the worst bit of false psychobabble I've ever heard.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but the truth is, I am well aware nobody is going to read this review anyway.  It'll immediately get dozens of down-votes from Hoover's minions (or her well-paid reputation management company), and buried under dozens more brief, worthless 5-star votes.  So what's the point?<br /><br />I've lost all faith in user-generated book reviews.  Clearly there's zero integrity in this system.

B009OCR1X4|5.0|The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to the film, Cloud Atlas, was music as enlightened and beautiful as the book and film.  As the book and film intertwined multiple plots and characters throughout varying time periods and dimensions, the musical score does the same with period styles of composition and instrumentation, ranging from the Classical, Romantic and Modern to the inclusion of even popular idioms.  Like all great Art, every time one experiences it, one finds more to discover and re-discover.

All the classic video games references are great, but you'll still have a great time watching this film even if you're not a gamer. This movie is the newest addition to my all time favorites. I've put the digital copy onto my iPod, the blu ray looks great on my TV. I really don't have anything negative to say about this movie. I'm a big fan of Disney and video games, and I thought this was a great marriage of the two.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|Love history like movies. This is truly one of Russell Crow's BEST !!<br />Sound was great. Well worth the money. The Roman Empire.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Wonderful collection of short stories. And excellent read. Good book club book. Lots to discuss.  I Highly recommend this book.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Huge batman fan all my life.Was skeptical of the reviews about how good this was going to be.But I got to tell you I'm impressed.Absolutely going to continue the story arc of this one!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Lots of copy & paste sex scenes & conversations throughout this book/series. The further into the series you make it, the less redundant it is but keep in mind it's a whips & handcuffs romance NOT a chocolates & roses romance.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|I thought it was great and with a fabulous ending!! I am not a huge fan of Helen Hunt but she was great in this movie!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|If you're not into all the copy & paste sex scenes or the Sub/Dom thing, just skip to this 3rd of the Fifty Shades Trilogy. You'll have some catching up to do but it'll be fine anyway.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Though this is fiction, it is based on actual facts during Frank Lloyd Wright's life during the early 1900's. A good read all the way through and a real shocker if you do not have much knowledge about the architect's personal life. It gives you a glimpse of what he was like and the tragedy he endured. I enjoyed the story, was saddened by it, and it encouraged me to find out more about Wright to see how events actually unfolded compared to this novel.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Well, like Topgun, once you get over the fact that it's just a movie, and not really about flying, pilots or reality--it's not bad.  Denzel plays a believable jerk and there's just enough fact to make the fiction entertaining.  sort of.<br /><br />It will not win any awards (worth mentioning) but it's a great movie to watch when you want to be entertained, want to be able to watch and 'not think' about the plot.<br /><br />Made me feel better about myself!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I am not that big of a fan of the series but watched the new Hobbit movie so needed to catch up.  Great movie at a great price!
B006YTTVHO|1.0|It's needs more info. It is short, and useless. It is free but not even worth the time. Sucks horribly
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The subject matter could have made for a dry read but Mr. Duhigg kept it interesting with the stories of real people to illustrate his examples. I find myself looking at things (i.e. friends, family, coworkers, businesses and my supermarket) with a scrutinizing eye.  I will most definitely recommend this book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Loving this game. Simple. Straight forward and to the point. Very, very relaxing &amp; calming. Based on the  classic Bejeweled principle. Mentally stimulating. This is another mind game that allows you to practice and exercise your focus &amp; concentration.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Reminiscent of &#34;The Stand&#34;, this novel combines action, a bit of philosophy, and memorable characters with a fond remembrance of a more innocent era. Totally enjoyable!
B00013RC8O|5.0|A HELLEUVA FLICK. STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW KOWALSKI'S HEART WITHSTOOD THE HANDFULL OF BENNIES...AND WITH NO WATER. WHAT A CUTE BLONDIE.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It was better, then the first 2, as it explained, what was wrong, with the hero, to be so perverted and ridiculous.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy continues to deal with todays threats. Witness our governments recent allegations of Chinese cyber threats to our networks.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|Shutter Island, had a surprise ending, that I wasn't expecting, but not my type of story.  Dennis Lehane is a good writer.
B001OG1YMC|5.0|I'm a big Prince fan, this is one of his signature albums, it represents a different time in music. No one in music history has reinvented themselve like Prince. Check out the movie for good laughs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know, that this is supposed to be a woman's fantasty.  But, it sure is not anything, I would want to do.  Ugh!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Friggin awesome, organize it like 1000 ways and search stuff an  take pictures and bullet points just go buy it you jackass
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This show keeps me on the edge of my seat. I love the character development and the story lines are amazing.
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|Great read, really enjoyed the story, the writing but the end wasn't enough, was a bit of a dad ending
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Boz Scaggs is a timeless musician and singer of songs.  He seems to only get better with age!  Beautiful collection of songs.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Really hard to put down because the players are developed well and the story moves quickly. A great read. Typical Baldacci.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. lots of levels, great time killer for me. cross between jewel quest and bejeweled. mode where your not timed as well. takes the pressure off ya.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I like this because it does give you some challenges. Color is great. Sounds are good. I would recommend this game.
0525953728|5.0|Not only did I enjoy this book but so did my 15 year old Grandson.  Made you feel as though you were there!
B008OOYALE|5.0|so fun to play! me and my kids would play all day if we could!!  Love all the different dragons!!
1451695195|5.0|Excellent science-based proof that consciousness continues after our brains shut down (meaning, that consciousness continues after death). To have this kind of scientific proof of that fact is revolutionary -- interesting that medical science, as far as I am aware, refuses to take this and other fact-based demonstrations of the primacy and eternal nature of consciousness seriously. What kind of scientists won't look at the data?
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is a suspense game. The whole point of the game is to collect pages and avoid the slenderman. If you think this game is pointless or boring you dont understand the meaning of suspense. The whole point is to leave you on edge to scare the crap out of yourself. Playing night at night in the dark is infinitely more scary then during the day. If you dont like suspense the game is not for you. Dont even bother trying. If you love suspense and thrillerS. This game is definitely for you. Its even more amusing when all your friends are in the room screaming when the slenderman gets them in their game :P
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It features characters from the movies and is pretty realistic (as realistic as dinosaurs can be). I'm obsessed with playing.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Based on a true story but with a much better array of actors this is a must have for baseball fans, regardless of your team affilation
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The original is so much better. For starters, I personally hate it. It is so much worse in my opinion butmaybe other peoples opinion are different. Just trust me. You don't want to buy it. Buy the original and see the differences. IT IS IS FREE! This version sucks so bad, its mama had to take it OFF DA LIST!
B0022W6L6G|4.0|Always good always will be. A constant reminder of what great music was. a cup of coffee and slip into the past.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Vanessa takes you on an intriguing journey of an adult strangled by her childhood. You won't easily lay this book aside. The urge to finish will keep you on edge has you seek to capture the ending.<br />Research done by Vanessa and her own life experiences bring a tremendous balance of detail and items to ponder.<br />Do we not all have some bonding issues?
B001223BLU|5.0|Hearing this wonderful music transported me back to the 60's when time was slow and enjoyable. Remembering old friends and girlfriends , comfort zone has arrived.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|You know from the price point that you'll be getting something with some amateur aspects to it.  But the story worked, the science was interesting and pretty plausible, and the writing didn't get in the way of that.  Everybody likes Robinson Crusoe stories; the question here is: do you think Mars is a more interesting backdrop than Crusoe's tropical island?<br /><br />Even allowing for his ordeal, our narrator here is kind of an annoying jackass.  I don't necessarily believe that someone like him would be picked for a mission to Mars.  But maybe a book like this narrated by a realistic astronaut would have been pretty boring.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like the idea of a mission to Mars, or of surviving alone against all odds (and telling poop jokes while you do it), you will like this book.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|phil may have problems of thinking he has not contributed to the world of music, but with the first cut from this album, you are assured that he is mistaken. he was and is one of the best with music
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Totally worth the money and the kids love being able to stream it everywhere! Nice moral and great feel, a good family movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|nice site gives what I need in weather .  very accurate.  check. it every night for next day. really love this site.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|The book is the well written conclusion of this trilogy. The biggest issue with this book is that I want more of a conclusion. The endings not bad, it just needs another book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It always scares me. The best app ever! I definitely recommend this app. Slenderman always shows up out of nowhere and sometimes right in front of you! SUPER SCARY!
B00A7OIXW6|1.0|Where should I begin? I hated it. Terrible movie! Whatever happened to good Disney movies? That being said, it is a PG rating and that rating is well deserved. One of the leading ladies angrily calls her soldiers Pussy Willows, emphasizing the first part and when another character says he is going to help her she says \\"like fun you are\\" which again when she starts you think she's going to say something else. To most people that's probably not a big deal. Most people watch TV and vulgar movies. I am not into that and found the movie to be too vulgar at parts and quite offensive.<br /><br />I guess when I saw the casting list I should have expected as such, but I grew up with Disney and find it difficult to admit they have lost their touch. Everything they did used to become an instant classic, but now it seems they have a couple of hits, but a majority of misses. I did not enjoy the humor and did not really find the message to be all that inspiring. There are plenty of better movies to watch if you are looking for a good message. Veggie Tales comes to mind. They have great message and plenty of humor that even we adults can appreciate without being vulgar.<br /><br />Also, the bad-guy self help group was just thrown in so they could show off a few classic characters. Don't buy this movie for the sake of the nostalgia the classic characters are only in the movie for a little while at the beginning. They could have done so much more with this film!! The ending was nice, but the first half of the movie was terrible. Oh and if anyone else has terrible roach phobias, they threw a couple in at the beginning (just enough to ensure I will never watch the movie again). They have now ruined many movies that way, what is up with that?
B00AFEXRME|4.0|The movie started out slow. After watching for a while it really got interesting. Denzel Washington was very good . You had to stay with it until the very end.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is great. it has more objectives than regular temple run and keeps you on your toes. gotta love it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Actor's really make the character come to life.  I like watching Downton again on DVD to catch nuences I might have missed on TV: AND, I can watch them all at once without waiting a week.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|all time classic! no wonder Harvard gave her an honorary PhD. in Jazz!!  It maybe a &#34;throwback&#34; but ever a classic!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Really good movie. We watched it as a family, and everyone really enjoyed it. I liked how it portrayed the human emotions as well as that of the horse.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|If your idea of a musical is two-and-a-half hours of non-stop singing, then this movie is for you.  It was exhausting!  And what is the deal with the little boy with the Artful Dodger accent?  I thought this was supposed to be in Paris, not London!  Anyway, they could have trimmed 30 minutes off of this one and it still would have worn me out.  I love a good musical (\\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" \\"West Side Story,\\" \\"Oliver!\\") but, please, give us some rests (i.e. unsung dialogue) every now and then!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|it sucks can't update my applications it always takes week's··  I hate this application<br />Have to b.s. tightening method for this
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always loved to play cards with my grandpa. Solitaire on line is great. You can play anywhere and anytime.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a crisp and vibrantly colored game I go to when I want to kick back with my mind taken &#34;out of gear&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is a nice way to pass time. ot also gives you creativity choice and a way to express yourself
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I was looking forward to some interesting reading but found this dealing with just sex , sex and more sex ! Becomes boring after some time !
B009K86D86|3.0|I felt like the movie had an agenda, rather than just being a straight up documentary. Not saying that's bad, but it seemed like a lot of opinion, and I disagreed with much of it. Interesting either way, and it's always good to absorb new material!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A whole lot of fun, I play it waiting for flights or on the airplane. Would recommend for challenging way to pass the time.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read this story because it was another of my book club titles which intrigued me as soon as I looked at its opening paragraphs on Amazon.  Then I couldn't stop thinking about the many issues it raised.  Who are these children growing up in the USA currently?  How do caring families interact with their kids -- kids who have somewhat secret lives?  If they dwell on the Internet and relate to one another in terms that older generations cannot even begin to understand, how should families play their parenting cards?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and recommend it because of its relevance and the writer's unique style of narration.  It has everything -- suspense, provocative food for thought, and a very good laying out of the justice system.  There is some ambiguity in the message and the plot which I wished were otherwise, but then I don't think it's necessary for a good book to have every question answered perfectly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandson and myself enjoyed this game, its very stimulating, action packed and it keep you on your toes, will not easily get bored. I recommend this game.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love this program! I love the era and especially like no cussing and no sex. When I am not feeling well I just sit around and  watch Lark Rise to Candleford.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|Grew up on HP 11C & 12C and still have them, but don't travel with them.  Now I have it all.  First time I used this app, just had to smile, so slick, and just like the original.
0307592731|5.0|Strayed delivers a powerful punch to the gut with her raw but inspiring narrative of her experience on the PCT.  Her courageous journey is one that many can relate to if we only look deeply inside ourselves and push ourselves beyond what we thought was possible.  Here's to hiking through our own versions of the PCT!
0061339202|2.0|Flow is often recommended by software designers. After watching a presentation that cited it a lot, I found it inspiring and have even recommended it--based on that presentation.<br /><br />However, I finally got around to reading the book itself, and I found that beyond those insights around what activities/conditions help create flow, it is a lot of fluff and really unsupportable derivations from the basic insights.<br /><br />My advice, find something that sums up the conditions for flow, and that's good enough. Don't waste your time on the book. Those insights are good, something to keep in mind for software design (and maybe even for yourself), but save your money and buy something else.
B00506NRBS|5.0|I love great entreprenuerial stories and people who live there lives different from the pack. This book was a fun read.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Kindle has something called &#34;X-ray&#34; - essentially a cross-reference to character appearances in the book. It was particularly useful for goon squad when characters appear in each other's stories,
B007VUA7VO|4.0|My charger is so so.Every time I'm playing with my charger in when I'm playing it'll just randomly bring me to this app
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great writing about some incredible human beings doing incredible things. Makes you want to be both a better runner and a better person. Amazing!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|One of the best and most exciting books I have ever read. I loved all the Greek mythology in it
B006OEPITO|5.0|Always worth re-reading at various stages of one's life.  This time I read it while traveling in India, which gave it special meaning.
B0081336FO|5.0|Just amazingly to watch-- So creative from Cloak & Dagger to<br />  Oh My! the use of texting and technolgy.<br />Marvelous the Chemistry of The Heroes! and Oh the Evilness of Moriarity!<br />One is held to the edge of one's seat but with humor and heart-<br />and Oh Please don't say Season 2 is the End!!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The third season is the best of the five seasons.  I can't believe is over.  Enjoy it.  The show is great
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Good graphics, enjoyable, good value for money.<br /><br />Enjoyable investigation good interaction with witnesses and suspects.<br /><br />Well worth five stars !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is fun because you get to run and you can't get eaten either.<br />You also  have to collect coins.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever at the world tour games do you see in<br />Rome you have to collect one hundred eggs I got all the eggs I lllllllllllllllllllllove this game
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is because you have to defeat  monsters  to get to the end of the game .p.s collect coins too.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I loved the movie on the big screen, and I am so glad that I will own it to show at home.  I have seen the play three times and have the 25 Year Annivery Dream Cast VHS.  This is my favorite Broadway play of all time!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It was nice to see Reacher's character progression from one book to another. The story started slow but it wound constantly  goes tighter and tighter. Unfortunately last fifty pages got to slow and too predictable. This is definitely worth reading. Not the best book about Jack, so four stars.[[ASIN:0515141429 Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, No. 1)]]
0452295548|5.0|Heard her speak on NPR, bought the book, read it, loved it... watched the TED talk and got teary eyed. An amazing story about a spiritual experience from the viewpoint of a trained scientific mind - none of the verbiage that smacks of &#34;True Believer&#34; dogma. Certainly an interesting book for those simply interested in the scientific side - the blow by blow of her stroke. But I'm much more fascinated by the &#34;unexplainable&#34; portion of her experience, and how she convincingly expresses her belief that everyone is capable of accessing that unified state that mystics of all religions point to as the ultimate goal of existence. Can ya tell I liked it? :)
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie! Would watch again. Lots of action involved. It is very much a guy movie, but I was not disappointed.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a great, almost entirely accurate, movie about the Carter/Reagan transition time period and the Iranian hostage crisis. It's always fun to finally find out what really went on in history!
B005J7K964|5.0|In 1984, disco sensation Giorgio Moroder decided to unleash his version of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS on to the public. Using color tinting, an original musical score featuring new songs from some of the top artists of the era, and new footage of the film from a recently discovered print, Moroder introduced a classic film to a new generation.<br /><br />When the film was released, some loved it while others loathed it. Some found it unnecessarily kitschy, yet others immediately took to Moroder's unique approach to the material. The film comes to life from the opening credits onward. Moroder utilizes subtitles instead of intertitles to speed up the pacing, and makes fascinating use of rotoscoping in some of the most pivotal scenes. You could say that Moroder has transformed the film into an extended music video, which would be accurate. It is immensely watchable from start to finish.<br /><br />Looking back on it now, there is a definite camp factor to the material that cannot be denied. The music dates the film and seems incredibly awkward at times, but it is still a curiosity that is worth watching.<br /><br />Available from KINO on DVD and Blu-ray.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Each story is wonderful and very, very hard to put down! More, Mr. Grisham, please, of your excellent short stories??
B00701L5XS|4.0|Used app to teach Cub Scouts knots worked great!!!!!!<br />Great for fishing as well. Only thing I would add are step by step instructions. Overall good app!
B005IQZB14|4.0|This story of a woman's redemption is wonderful. Could especially help any woman struggling over the death of her mother!
B003DT194G|5.0|I purchased this DVD many years ago, but it, unfortunately, became misplaced. It tells such a good story, I went ahead and bought it again!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This game is great for mobile devices who want animals in creative play. They only give you like 20 miniuts to play the demo and at first the controls were hard. But once you figure it out it is fun!! I like this game a lot.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|I just bought this cd yesterday and have listened to it several times already. Andrea's voice is so amazing and beautiful to listen to. David Foster has done it again.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a great game if you like to find hidden objects. I don't know why people say you can't zoom, bcs you can. Also, I always play without the timer so I never have to worry about time penalties. I love it.
B004AUFVU0|5.0|Havent seen this not in HD so cant compare original to old. This is a classic every movie fanatic should watch.
B0083Z614S|3.0|The book did not pique my interest,  so I've set it aside to read at a later time.  I think the book was written for a younger age level.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was in love with temple run until my brother told me about this game and so I got it fir freed on the kindle fire its so much fun. I would give all five stars. GET IT NOW. YOU WILL LOVE IT.!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|everytime my Internet goes down I have to restart. I've restarted 5 times and it is really annoying. I would have put 5 stars if it wasn't for this.
B000I3PA8Q|1.0|I did not watch because in my first try the movie didn't didn't download and in my second try the movie was not there anymore.<br /><br />I am very dissatisfied with Amazon and the way they handle these movies. I will not order this kind of product anymore.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love reading on my kindle.  Got this one for my book club this month.  A fast read, definitely engrossing, not the best written thing ever but decent.  Kept the pages turning.  The ending falls a little flat (sorry!) and seemed a little rushed.  Don't normally say this ,but could have used about 25-50 more pages to make it flow better I think! But definitely worth the price.
B0086700CM|3.0|My 15-year-old granddaughter insisted that I try it. I know video games are too fast for me, but I did try it. It was fun, but too fast. I don't enjoy these types of games for that reason.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thought provoking. Great characters. Well acted. Always keeps you on your toes. I Can't wait to see what happens next.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|its way to short it only gives you like 15 minutes and it wont e en let me place any blocks I t just wont if u don't want to get dissapointed don't get this app
B0060CV31C|5.0|love this movie and always have since it came out in the 90s .....a favorite family movie of ours!Great movie
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really like it but I gave it 4 stars because u cant use the craft box. u cant blow things up and u cant use the storage box either. there should be people just like the one on the computer. and animals other than that its great
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I can't wait for each episode to play each week. Great characters and plot. The killer reminds me a little of Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal. Very psychologically twisted. Love it.
B004WR125O|4.0|The adapter was easy to set up when following the directions in the provide manual. So far it has worked well streaming music from Pandora.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|An excellent book about my favorite musician, author and artist. I learned so much. It was delivered to my Kindle within minutes....
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|We love getting these to watch on rainy afternoons!! My daughter has watched them all up to this point. Thanks!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I had never seen the TV series and my son gave me a present of the first book for Christmas.  As soon as I started reading it, I was hooked.  The breadth of the saga is staggering and the endless feats of great bravery and dreadful skullduggery never cease to shock and amaze me.<br /><br />The books are very long, but Ive already finished the first three and I'm about to start on book four.  Can't wait to find out what happens next!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|A baby is scathed then this game. This shows that not everything that is free you should get. I wasted time and space. This game is disappointing.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It gives insight to the happenings and the aftermath of a boy in an Irish orphanage. Thank goodness they no longer exist.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I expected better puzzles, there is very little variety.  They should have more complex puzzles and better instructions to solve them.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book is witty, funny, hip, a mystery with some romance and an easy read.  I Recommend it for all ages.  From boomers to their children and high school grandchildren.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|I was hoping to use this with Streets and Trips on my Surface Pro, but it seems that the device driver does not work properly for this 64bit version of Windows 8. Might work well on the 32 bit version. I haven't tried. If they update the device driver, then it'd be great. Right now, the device software they include isn't recognized by my computer.
B004JHY8A8|3.0|I bought this book as I was told it was brilliant but was quite disappointed. It was readable but I wasn't dying to pick it up every day. I didn't like the main character as I thought she was over the top and that put me off the rest of the story.
B007IK44CK|1.0|Predictable, no longer thrilling; best to watch the old TV series than this movie, First movies were much better to watch
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is fun...sometimes too much fun! But if you r bord it is good way to pass the time away
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it a lot. I had a few problems here or there but as a whole I really enjoyed it.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Great old spoof movie I remember watching when I was very young brought back memories and the old actors great
B00821OX98|5.0|Didn't think that this show was going to be this good but it's really good. Noah Wiley is a great lead actor. Has matured very much since His days on the show ER. Will Patton is also very good. Blueblood could not so much...
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|Sell this season back to Hulu and Netflix... This will make my life 100000000x more easier! I am missing out on this show because I can't catch up! I hate this! Come on Amazon you've pulled smarter moves than this!!!
B003B2C92G|4.0|Spawn Blu-Ray Dvd is great.<br />This is a good movie to get.<br />I recommend everyone to get this Spawn Movie.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|I would give the show a perfect 5. However, the quality of the product, the Amazon Instant movie download, was worse than tape/VCR quality. Even fast forwarding was a true pain. Also, no subtitles. I feel like I just down graded from the home theater experience and wasn't worth the $3. I would have rather went to the movie store and rented it. I'm not being a downer, just honest. Until there are more capabilities and better quality for the price, my Amazon Instant movie downloads will be very limited.
B0035Q4AFC|4.0|An older movie, but I found it interesting and learned much about Charlie Chaplin that I did not know.  Nice performance by RD Jr.
1847940323|5.0|If you want to understand the how's and why's of change, this book is great.  The examples provided are relevant and inspirational.  Whether you're seeking to change yourself or change your work environment, this book offers concrete, easily implementable, solutions.
B008K93302|1.0|I could not get this app to open a single media file on my Kindle Fire HD.  Don't borher with this one.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Coming from a doctor's perspective and experience brings greater satisfaction to me in knowing that what is beyond is in fact real. More real than what we on earth can possibly know. I look forward to death, not because I'm anxious to go, but knowing my spirit will live on forever. Thanks for this book and for sharing your intimate knowledge of the brains capacity and the spirit or conscience capacity as well. Very cool.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I thought I knew a lot about Bob Marley's life, his achievements, and his work. Wow, was I wrong! Such an informative, honest and interesting biography of one of the most influential people in musical history.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Wonderfully sexy. Definitely keep you wanting more. I have problems turning it off. I love this show and I will recommend it to all of my friends.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|Even the first book in this series didn't really thrill me. Especially after reading other books about similar society's and rebellions, such as Divergent. (really liked that series). This book seems to take forever to cut to the chase. To much unnecessary story line, not my favorite.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Too wordy and predictable.  Soft read for a Sunday afternoon and to escape the real world stress.  The movie was better.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|for hour of fun,this takes a lot of imagination and knowledge of building things it is a lot of fun trying!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great Case. Nice to have a good protection over the earpiece with an additional charge. Perfect for purses and people on the go!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I loved the first 2 books in the series and was eagerly awaiting book 3, read book 3, got to the end and was surprised by what a let down it was. I agree with most others when I say that the book felt rushed at the end and that it should have had another chapter or two to completely close the series. We got to know the characters only to never find out what life is like at the end. I'm sorely disappointed and I feel completely ripped off by even wasting my time reading book 3. :-(
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I'm sure there are details behind this game that I haven't figured out. I have earned points in the 100,000 plus area and still do not have enough to purchase additional help. Does the purchase of additional help require an actual purchase thru amazon?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book!  I loved it!  It is both a classic and contemporary love story.  As a classic, it has all the elements of love, forbidden romance, wealthy suitor and mystery.  What makes it contemporary is that it is current, explicit, erotic and deals with forbidden subjects.  It's relevant and is some ways relatable.  Book One has left me anxious to read Book Two.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|Thoughtful, gripping and not at all like the other Stargate series. Robert Carlyle gives a stellar performance as Dr Rush!
B00479SVBU|1.0|did not work out of the box, and I try new fuse that came in the box, one more from radioshack, still not working.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie it just gets better and better.  Love the storyline, love the actors, love everything about it.....except....for the fact that it was not shot in Memphis.  I guess if you're not from Memphis, you'd never know.  However, I am, so the exterior shots were distracting to me since I could tell they weren't done in Memphis.  Otherwise this is a great movie!  I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I liked it because I got 600 coins.<br />The game is the best game ever . This game is cool rock.
B00B6DTWM2|4.0|Superbly acted and filmed.  Good storyline with a not so obvious ending.  Really enjoyed it and will watch it again.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I would recommend this s game If you like scary I love we meaning my friends and I luv e it he the slender man is awesome
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The first couple of episodes were slow, in my opinion.  Didn't know if I liked the direction it seemed to be going.  But by the 3rd episode, all was well and the show was back on track with a vengeance!
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's work is riveting and sincere.  It is a story that is compelling and intriguing.  I would recommend this book for everyone.  Thank you to Dr. Alexander for writing out his experiences and doing so with a methodology that supports his credibility.  One of the best books I have read in a long time and I am sharing it with friends and family.  Thank you Dr. Alexander!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|i didn't really like it but a lot of other people did apparently. i thought the characters were totally unbelievable, which made it hard for me to enjoy the book.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I bought this CD after discovering the group on Youtube and pouring through all their videos. This CD grabs a great selection of their works and gives the listener a great scope of their talent. Some of the songs are covers of chart-topping hits, but with their own twist on it. A great example is Pepopni (Paradise in Swahili). The Piano Guys strip the song down to a piano, cello, tribal instruments, and a amazing vocalist singing in his native tongue. It's songs like this that make the CD a great purchase whether for an adult looking to relax or a parent looking to soothe a child to sleep. Highly recommend!
B007SGM084|1.0|this is the most repetitive book i've ever read. if she didn't use the same words to describe the sex scenes it might have been more tolerable. might. it took me over a year to read all three books if thats saying anything about my opinion.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|You literally walk and find letters. That's the game. It's not scary. Graphics are not bad and I give developer credit but gameplay is quite boring. Will be deleting after post.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Works as advertised, they fixed minor annoying things and it runs really well, being able to custom mix several sounds works great, though more control such as sound playback speed would make it perfect... Overall a great app and helps sleep
B002XOTPU2|5.0|I have 5 cats & Simon knows all of a cats' funny quirks. Love the videos but gave the book to a very ill friend to help lift his spirit. Worked great, loved hearing him laugh again.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This one is wonderful for those that want to stay in the know. It's all in one place and covers whatever you want it to cover.
B0091REZMW|3.0|fun game. Every day I look forward to logging in. confusing at first, and sometimes unnecessarily complicated. but different, to say the least.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Somehow author comes across as one who has big ego. Hate people who use letter I too often.Only read 15 pages.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I liked it enough that I'll probably read it again in a few months.  I'm now reading the other books in the sequence.
B003JTHWPA|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning of the book and as it went on I found it horribly depressing... which of course, life can be but I felt like the old adage... no rest for the weary. I read it through to the end. The writing style was classic and the characters in the book were interesting. I hoped for a somewhat happy ending, but no can do. When I closed the last page I felt weary.
0425252868|5.0|Bought this for my husband when it first came out. He loved it! Very touching story! It was a fast read for him and kept him engaged! Recommended for anyone.....not just for men.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I saw the interview on TV and had to read the book.  I am a student of history and marvel at the cruelty people have displayed.  I can't believe it is still happening and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it.  From the Rape of Nanking to the Great Mao Revolution to this.  It makes you wonder if we will ever survive.  I am praying that with the internet and modern communications North Korea and other black holes of violence and cruelty will be exposed and eliminated.  I get hopeful when I seen TV coverage that shows these slave camps for what they are.  ....and I can't believe that Dennis Rodman was so stupid and arrogant as to believe he should represent the USA and visit North Korea.  This isn't the same as the American Ping Pong team leading the way for President Nixon to visit Chairman Mao back in the 1970s.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. It gives a very realistic depiction of what a zombie apocalypse would be like. However, this season is getting a little stale with how long the fight between the prison and the town has gone on. But it's following the graphic novel, so no - stars.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|All 3 generations in our house love this:  me, my son (age 27) & my Dad (age 91).  I was especially happy to hear Hava Nagilia as one of the song selections.
0230754686|5.0|What a compelling book!  When my dad recommended this book to me I was skeptical because North Korean prison camps were not a particular interest of mine, but I decided to give it a shot.  I am so glad I did!  I learned a lot about human rights violations in North Korea that I knew existed, but really didn't know the details of.  This book details the daily life at Camp 14 from the story of an escapee, Shin.  It also illustrates what life is like after being in one of those camps for those incredibly rare situations where people escape.  I couldn't put it down.  This should be on everyone's must-read list.
B00BJA2VFW|2.0|Bought this game on my kindle but it keeps on freezing. Overall I am disappointed because I love these types of games but the freezing ruined it for me.
0062014536|2.0|When I came to the end, I could not believe that it was in fact the end!  How does an author close out a trilogy with no answers - so open ended?  You need to have an answer for your avid readers, closure.  This needs to be rethought, perhaps turn it into a 4 book series, not a trilogy.  Use the last book to wrap up the story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|addicted. I can't stop playing lol. You get so into it you don't realize how many levels you completed. Yeaaah...
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is a very intense series,with many mini stories that all tie in togeather. Any one of them could be a movie on its own,but togeather it is epic!!!! I love,love,love game of thrones!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if u like puzzle games will love it there's so many fun little games some are easy and other are hard
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The book is better than I expected, based on the 1939 movie. The storytelling is simplistic, but the narrative had many unexpected turns. Overall, a very enjoyable fantasy. Cannot wait to read the remaining Oz books.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|If you are using the common, regular mouse, I would highly recommend you switch to this vertical ergo mouse now before you end up with any problems in your arm or wrist.  I figured it out too late and have switched because of tendonosis in my elbow. I have one at work and home.  And ever since getting this mouse at home, even my daughter swears by it and is really disliking the regular mouse at school.  The small size fits my &#60;7&#34; right hand perfectly and it was very easy to get used to.  It costs a fair amount compared to those cheap, regular mice, but I know it was worth it.  Wish I had known about this ergo mouse years ago but I didn't know I was working 'wrong' all this time until I got hurt.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|For all you old folks out there that fell in love with the original Nintendo game &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot;, I promise you will absolutely love this game!!!!
1439156816|5.0|I'd like this pic even if it was a \\"nobody.\\" great book. great audiobook. Only problem is he implies Rotts and Pits are inherently dangerous dogs when Goldens and small dogs bite more.It's a great book, very funny and helpful otherwise. might be the best of all.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Just like super Mario!!!! I really enjoy playing and its A great way to pass time. If you enjoy Mario I'm sure you will enjoy this too!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Amazing book. Incredibly hard to put down, can not wait to read Gone Girl. Gillian is truly an artist in my words.
1616550414|5.0|It's everything a Zelda fan wants in one single book! The level of detail is beautiful, The official timeline from Nintendo is one of the reason I wanted to get this. Concept art from most of the games, you have to get this, like now!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's a dictionary what do you think it's going to be like it is boring and I find it in useful
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it...I can't wait to start the next one...I haven't been able to put the book down since I started, maybe now I can get some sleep!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is better than other games I played before. I think there should be less time for the production of soldiers and tanks and others.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Most fun since LOST. It is so nice to watch episodes without commercials! New twists and turns at every episode.
B007TK77QE|5.0|this is a most wonderful read...I've owned it less that a year and reread it already...this book is driven by its complex characters and the ripples of effect they have on each other...I loved it!
0385344228|5.0|Disclosure: I listened to the unabridged audio of [[ASIN:B00BR9U45O Defending Jacob (Unabridged Edition) [AudioCD(2012)]]].<br /><br />For two weeks, I followed the agonizing, cleverly plotted, at times humorous, but always thoughtful drama of the Barber family. Others may have peeked at the ending, but it is much harder to do with the CD version!<br /><br />William Landay writes his finest novel here. I was immediately drawn into the drama through a short scene - a flashback, perhaps? The story begins to unfold with a perfect portrait of a family, hit by a tsunami. Again, the scene that is a flashback, or perhaps the present. The story continues, as a family drama, a novel of loss, a legal thriller, a story of men who are ruthless, and finally, ------------. An ending that was true, so true to the characters.<br /><br />Wonderful read! Audio by Grover Gardner, outstanding.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is book 2 of the of the Crossfire Novel.  Loved these books and they are only second to my favorites Thoughtless/Effortless/Reckless series.  I cannot wait for the third book to come out!  A MUST READ SERIES!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|If you have ever liked video games, you will love this movie. It is full of video game history, it's fun just trying to get all the references. The voice acting talent was top notch. The visuals were fantastic. A must see movie.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book sucks it doesn't rely tell u that much about it but the one thing I do like is the abbreviations
B006UV8DJS|2.0|Not very user friendly in my opinion.  Had to contact Amazon just to down load.  Instructions vague. Could be a good app but takes alot of trial and error to use.  Thought it would be a fun app to use and it might be in a month or more
B007HC3LHS|5.0|A book that keeps you reading long into the night. A taut and suspenseful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would highly recommend it to those who like a gripping page turner.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I was not sure this movie would really cut it for me. The movie reviews were mixed and I hated the commercials and plus I just expected Disney to rewrite the juice & fun out of it.<br /><br />Surprise surprise. I thought it was great. It is very entertaining, professionally made, engrossing, and exciting. I can criticize little parts here and there, but, the film captures the heart of the novels, the overall feeling of the Barsoomians, and of John Carter himself, though, if I were to do it, I might add a little grit to the whole scenario in a way that might make it, well, un-Disney. But I'm glad Disney did it because at the end I got that feeling you really only get when watching a well received Disney film. Like, that smiling feeling you know you'll be in the theater for the next one.<br /><br />When I was a kid I read these little paperbacks till the spines literally wore off and I had to staple the pages together. I was no less displeased by the current adaptation. More please.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is book one in the Crossfire series and my very first read by Sylvia Day.  You will love both Gideon and Olivia and this is only second to the Thoughtless/Effortless/Reckless series.  I cannot wait for the third book to come out!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is fun, addictive, eases you up the learning curve to challenging levels, and has unobtrusive ads. This is a great FREE game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It has amazing new features and more I play this app every single moment I'll wake up and play it I love it so much...........get it you won't regret it I got it for my kindle fire HE
B00005JPAO|5.0|Wonderful film.  Helen Mirren is spectacular, as usual.  I have loved every movie that I have seen of hers.  No wonder she won the Academy Award.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Sooo addicted to this game although some levels are a little more difficult to master. I've read overs reviews and can understand why little kids have a difficult time and lose interest on the higher levels. This is a very cute game. I love Om Nom! :):)
B007HC3LHS|5.0|First I sampled this book on my Kindle.  Then I couldn't wait to read the rest of it.  And what a bargain!! With my busy schedule, I can't read as much as I would like, so this book took me about a week.  I read it whenever I could - a few chapters at lunch, and then at night - on my Kindle Paperwhite - in the darkness.  I found myself thinking about the story and mostly about the characters all the time.  This is a suspenseful and violent story.  It involves Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Domestic violence.  I personally haven't experienced either, but it sure seemed believeable to me.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers like \\"Gone Girl\\".  The beginning pages are a bit confusing, but don't let that stop you from the rest.  When I finished the book, I went back and reread those first two chapters again - and it was so gratifying.  It made total sense then and really gave the book a sense of closure.  So if you read this book, I suggest you do the same:  after you finish the book, go back and read the first court transcript and the next chapter.  It's a real \\"aha\\" moment.  I can't wait to read Elizabeth Rayne's next book - it comes out next week!
1451695195|4.0|A lot of people shrug off the after-life or NDEs. Centuries of experiences are no longer enough to convince supposedly enlightened people. Yet when a doctor like Alexander has an experience like this, people say, \\"Hey, wait a second\\" and take a second look. Everything here seems genuine, with no hidden agendas. Telling his story can hardly be another stepping stone for his career. Where many just don't believe in the soul, heaven, etc. just because of what they have heard, or think they heard, Alexander shows that such dismissals aren't rational. Belief in a higher existence is not the realm of fantasy. He mentions how physics does show there is more to the world than meets the eye. Others have explained this in greater detail, as in [[ASIN:0984061487 Beyond the Cosmos]]. What religion has claimed for so long, is verfied by science. The myth of \\"science vs. religion\\" doesn't hold water under even minimal scruitiny.<br /><br />So what to make of what Alexander saw? Obviously, he struggled to put in words what he saw. This is not unlike the wild imagery used by writers like the Apostle John (in Revelation) trying to explain what was shown to him. To be fair, however, why do so many of these NDE books describe heaven, God, etc., in such different terms? Why do personal beliefs seem to color each one's experiences? These are the tough questions that most are avoiding. In Alexander's experience, he makes it sounds like anyone will be in heaven no matter what. That doesn't seem fair that you can do anything now and be rewarded later. Hank Hanegraaff's [[ASIN:1617950815 AfterLife]] gets into the tough issues others don't want to.<br /><br />As far as the afterlife is concerned, there will always be those who, no matter the evidence, won't change their mind. But Alexander's story will definitely give people something to ponder. For more on the science connection, see also [[ASIN:B003D7JYMM Why the Universe Is the Way It Is]] or why science points to a designer: [[ASIN:0801068274 The Cell's Design]].68274 The Cell's Design]].
B007EDYN36|4.0|I've always been a huge Kiss fan and knew of their troubled relationships.  It was really nice to hear Peter's first hand account of what went on behind the scenes of one of the great rock n' roll bands.  At the same time it's really sad to learn that it's not a band of brothers playing rock n' roll living the ultimate dream, but rather big business with inflated egos selling a brand.  If you're a Kiss fan this book is a must read.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|It's true that the first 15 minutes are action packed, then you get into the story, but that's the only way make the movie work.  Most people get their high after the plane scene and get bored, but I think it's a pretty good movie with a good ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this game...I spend approx. 1 hour commuting and this game keeps me occupied while the time flies by.  It also helps in exercising the mind and one's problem-solving and other kinds of skills.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have minecraft on kindle and computer and xbox - the best game ever now! I love the pocket version because you can build, survive, and craft...
B008QMMEOE|4.0|App worked well for a few months now all the unlocked content I paid for is locked again and they want me to pay again
B003YL4LYI|3.0|3 1/2 stars is what I would give the novel if it was possible. Having said that, the series is still in my opinion truly worth the read. The main reason for this rating is the fact that books 4 and 5 should not have been  written convoluting the series as a whole. Writing them both to cover the same time period made it confusing and frustrating.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am very  anxious  for the  next  novel to be released.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i totally love this game its awesome this is the only game i love its just really really cool u shoud play it too
B008B8AOQI|5.0|The cd case was cracked when it arrived and i was a bit disappointed, but the cd was fine. I started listening to Passenger on youtube and instantly loved it! I am so so happy with my purchase. I absolutely love every song on this cd. I could listen to it forever. It sort of reminds me of Ed Sheeran a bit. Recommend!
B00AFEY7QO|2.0|Overall this could have been such a great purchase. But it is marred by very sub-standard audio on the video. The concert was a decent length, good song selection, the band was energetic (although the crowd not so much). The CD is pleasing enough but could have been much longer.<br /><br />The one huge negative is the sound on the video. It really is about as bad as I have come across for a concert DVD well....ever. Know going in not to expect much from the audio. Such a shame. And how many video concerts has SOS released? It really was not too much to expect better audio. And SOS should have insisted upon it.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I like the series, I he has set up a massive world with amazing things in it.  Just wish it moved at a faster pace
B00881VLCE|5.0|Many puzzles available, and a large number of them are free! You can vary the number of pieces and skill. You can choose to have them rotated or not. Lots of fun. I'm hooked.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am very satisfied  with all of my purchases from amazon.  The purchases that were mailed and the ones that were sent directly to my kindle fire.  Thank you amazon.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am a brony and I say that this is the best app ever!!!!!!! Rainbow Dash rules!!!!!!!!!! So yea that's my review.... bye ^-^
B00004W221|5.0|This movie is so good and so necessary! We don't all have to be the same to be very special!
B009JZVT70|5.0|Fantasy meets your everyday.  What more can one say!  it does not disappoint even and i  believe it can be watched over again.  Buy the DVD for the future.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Solid Sim style game for those who enjoy either Sim builders or dinosaurs. Fun and not too intensely time consuming.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Few of us would give up so much for our country and team. His dedication and focus are what makes seals the elite warriors they are known to be.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|A young woman has been haunted since she was eight years old by odd noises and shapes visiting her in the night. No matter where she moves the paranormal activity continues. Now an adult and living with her boyfriend the strange happenings have started up again. As a way to prove or disprove what is happening, her doubting boyfriend buys an expensive camera to set up and record their bedroom at night. The conceit of the movie is that all the footage you see is from their camera. It not only films while they are sleeping, the boyfriend carries it along during the day catching conversations, arguments and a visit from a psychic who tries to help. The phenomena escalates with the boyfriend deliberately provoking whatever is following his girlfriend because he does not believe in it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the way the movie was made as \\"found footage\\" from the camera the couple used but they didn't do enough with it to make this a truly scary horror film. When you're showing two people sleeping you have a perfect set up to scare the audience with something suddenly happening but not much does for the first half of the movie. I understand they wanted the story to build to a climax but I was bored. The second half has a few creepy scenes although they telegraphed the ending so when it happened I wasn't surprised. This was an interesting concept for a movie however not enough was done to make it truly scary.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As a history major in college, I enjoy the plot twists that parallel the historical period of that time.<br />And, despite the serious drama, at moments I find myself laughing out loud at Dame Maggie Smith - &#34;Violet&#34;.  She truly is a gem.
B00A83075M|3.0|WRECK IT RALPH has a lot going for it.  It's visually impressive, has a good voice cast, especially John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch.  As with most Disney animation, there's a strong moral message lurking beneath the frivolous activities.  So why do I feel less enthused than most of my fellow reviewers?<br />It seems a little lengthy and tedious; there's nothing really new going on and it's a fairly predictable film.  Both kids and adults should find it enjoyable----I just find it ordinary, a film I will easily forget.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This TV series is so captivating.  The characters are interesting and the story is compelling.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Loved it. good for waking up in the morning. the only bad thing is that it stays open all the time wish i could limit that.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Has many features, love the way it goes through all the different types of calculators by just swiping with your hand
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Every song on the CD is great.  Good southern rock.  This group reminds me of ZZ Top or Lynryd Skynyrd
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Only problem with this series is that they change poses/exercises with no time or warning for new pose/exercise.  Otherwise pretty darned decent!
0679805273|5.0|I have had all my son's teacher's write a note and sign his book beginning with his Kindergarten teacher.  He is now in 8th grade and my plan is to keep going until he finishes high school.  I know I may not have that many signatures from high school by the end, but I am hopeful a few teacher's will stand out for him and make this book meaningful to him.<br /><br />He may not appreciate it now but in the future my guess is he will.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The pain, the fear, the excitement, the heartache...I felt them all as I read this book, hardly able to put it down.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So Much better than the default app that comes with the kindle. love this app it was a good way of logging into your facebook.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Not worth it. No twists and turns in this one. Pretty predictable from beginning to end. Over hyped in my opinion.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Article Silver has always worked for me.  I've been using it on builds for over 10 years. It's easy to use in this tube and easy to store between builds.
B002PNER9U|5.0|Have always loved the music, and they did a great movie adaptation of the play.  Love musicals?  then you will love this movie.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|This is KILLER Priest!  If you already own the essentials (Screaming For Vengeance, Painkiller, etc.) this is a solid must-have also.  Despite being one of their “newer” albums, this is one of the best in my book.  The sound is absolutely amazing.  To listen to the powerful guitar riffs with Halford’s strong voice and to think the band’s core was in their late 50s when they recorded this (Halford: 56, KK: 56, Glenn: 60, Ian Hill: 57) is utterly stunning.<br /><br />AND, it’s not only musically amazing, but lyrically, too.  Many a night I have been driving home from work, “wondering” like I often do on my 1 hr+ commute, cranking the song “Visions”.  It speaks to my soul- check it out and I think you’ll see what I mean!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Great opening half hour or so, but then John Goodman was introduced and his character wasn't in step with the tone of the film. And by the last half hour it had these comedic moments with all the cast in a hotel room, that were just bad.<br />FLIGHT was certainly entertaining but I thinking they dropped the ball in places.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|My whole family just love this game! My 6 yr old granddaughter kicks my *** every time I try  to play.<br />The iPad version runs great with no crashes. I noticed(I'm new to the Angry Birds game family) I get new items every week.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I have so much fun with these games! This one is especially challenging and funny. The dialog is almost as good as the game. The extra challenges are very well done. Can't wait for more levels.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|not a good game kinda pointless. littlest pet shops are better in real life. good for younger kids. j mills
B00005LK94|5.0|This movie is rated 3 1/2 stars out of 4.  The photography on this movie is outstanding, especially the shots from above.  It's a very nice movie which I had already seen and, had it recorded on my Dish DVR.  I played it for my grandchildren when they visited but, time ran out.  My daughter wanted me to save it for her.  Instead, I purchased the DVD for her.  It's a nice movie that you can take your children to see - the story line is about a young gal that looses her divorced mother who used to live in New Zealand and, suddenly has to live with her father in Canada - on the other side of the world!

B007BFSYMS|1.0|this app changed all my .data files so that it opens with this app kinda sucked. wish i didnt take up so much room to.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|One of the best games I  ever played. A little difficult for children. If you have to waste money on an app, waste it on this one! Lots of fun. I can't believe that some people wrote bad reviews. This game explains how to play and is glitch free. I recommend this app to people who get bored and need some fun.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|A little slow moving at times but Crowe is convincing in his role, even if the beginning seemed a little implausible.  I was engrossed the entire time and enjoyed the movie.

At first, Molly is just putting in her time--it keeps her out of juvie and out of her foster parents' house--but she is soon pulled into Vivian's story, one similar to Molly's own. Both lost parents at an early age. Neither had relatives to turn too. Vivian, living in New York City, was put onto an \\"orphan train\\" and sent West to be taken in by another family. The orphan trains ran from 1854-1929, relocating tens of thousands of neglected and orphaned children from New York City to rural America, an early version of foster care.<br /><br />Molly was placed in foster care because her drug-addicted mother couldn't care for her after her father's death. By the time the novel starts, Molly has spent years moving from one foster family to another and she has learned how to work the system in order to survive. The persona Molly has invented has served to keep her emotionally detached from her foster families has worked, but it's not an image she wants to maintain. She wants to change, but isn't sure how.<br /><br />The novel takes place in current times in Maine where Molly and Vivian live and the early 1920s of New York City and Minnesota. The reader is drawn into the tales of Molly and Vivian as they try to survive lives not of their choosing. Both are separated from their heritage and are expected to conform to the expectations of the families each is placed with. Both struggle not to loose themselves completely and allow others to define who they ought to be. This is a novel difficult to put down until story's end.olly and Vivian as they try to survive lives not of their choosing.

B0055S348W|3.0|I really like this program. However, as you may already know, Google apps do not work with Kindle. This program has Gmail, Google print and calender integration which doesn't work because of this. The good news is that it does print just fine to a wired network printer and PC based printers on my LAN. If all features worked, I would give the app 5 stars, but this is really an Amazon Kindle issue, not  a Dynamic software problem.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies more than any of the previous variants and this episode kept that streak going.  Lots of action and style and good character acting by Craig.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|It's Harry Potter--what more do I need to say?  Great adaptations of the books.  Each one gets a little darker.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Honestly, it needs to be updated. I feel lucky that it works on my tablet, but I have played on the pc and this version is far too much behind. It is missing minigames and puzzles. In fact there are only a few of each. Not to mention the missing zen garden and endless minigames and puzzles. Overall, it is far inferior to almost all other platforms that it is avalible on. Sorry, popcap...it would be five stars if you would just UPDATE IT!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book! I loved \\"The Notebook\\" so it was an easy choice to choose a book from the same author! Loved it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was hooked from the first page, great story, will look for more books by this author, really good reading
B0055B7IPE|5.0|However this is a sweet movie--and actually handles the subject very nicely.  Have loved Ed Asner for years, and he certainly delivers (as always) in this movie as well.  Just a fun, sweet movie about aging and death--which are generally not subjects that get the kid treatment.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|I was looking for a good series to read aafter Game of Thrones.This was not it. I read the first Malazan book and got halfway through the second book when I just couldnt do it anymore. After 1000 pages there was not one charachter I cared about nor was there any charachter I hated. Many times I would go back and reread pages after realizing I started to daydream due to lack of interest. Maybe the story picks up later in the series,  but I wasn't going to give it any more of my time.
0062082353|3.0|This was intersting but very repetative.  Good to hear some of the things our troups experienced during the war .
B006885FZI|3.0|The Pacific theatre is a compelling story and The Pacific series fails to deliver the intensity that this battle ground surely was.  While I appreciate the producers efforts to tell the story from the view point of those who were in action, the character development was some how flat.  I found it difficult to connect with the on screen personas and found none of them compelling enough to develop an empathic relation with.  The cinematography and production values are excellent as one would expect from a Spielberg project.  Overall, I was disappointed in the series.  I think this series probably had high expectations following in the heels of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|wool omnibus is the work of a writer who can bring tremendous detail into vivid view.  I enjoyed this story.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Good Reading<br /><br />I really enjoyed  the first book in the series. Therefore I am enjoying this book also.<br />I am looking forward to the last book in the trilogy. The characters are wonderful,<br />and the history of the period makes a very interesting book.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Really enjoyed the first season. Little smarmy and somewhat unbelievable at times, but overall is an enjoyable series.  Acting is actually pretty decent.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What an intense movie.  This movie is a historical  thriller about a CIA operative Tony Mendez who In 1979, rescued Americans that hid after the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries. Several Americans were taken hostage for 444 days before they were released.  This movie is based on real events and will keep you on the edge of your seat.

B00B7G3NFU|4.0|What a sweet movie based on John Hawkes.  John took a life that could have been meaningless and turned his life into one that was very meaningful. There is so much we can learn from others, especially those who have less but make the most out of life. Inspirational and funny at times.  Life is short so....  Live life to its fullest!
1401937519|5.0|I loved this book! It was a confirmation of experiences I have had in my own spiritual quest and strengthens the conclusions I reached from those experiences. What a joy to read.
B004M8S6FC|5.0|Most of the times when you read so many positive reviews of a book or writer, you wonder if the ratings are just over-rated because of the initial publicity hype. Old Man's War lives up to its billing of being a classic sci-fi book. The story keeps you engrossed right from the sedate start till the cliff hanger climax. I am just wondering why Hollywood hasn't adapted this into a movie script yet...
B000VHPXR2|5.0|I own the dvd as well and I juat never get tired of it. By far the best cast in my opinion.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Fun to play with friends - everyone has their own drawing style ... some our very detailed and others draw stick figures!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very cool movie, especially if you grew up playing some of these games! I would have liked to have seen more of the cameo'd characters though. Sonic the Hedgehog should have gotten more than 2 seconds... But I guess that was not the point of the movie. Still, it would have been cool.
B00263HWM8|3.0|As generic action movies go, this is as generic and action as they come.  It has it's ridiculous scenes and assumptions that it asks you to overlook in the name of fun, and in general, you will be happy to do so.<br /><br />Beyond that, this movie is nothing special and the only reason it is more memorable than every other generic action movie is the fact that it belongs to the Mission Impossible franchise.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth Hart totally delivers the full package, there is no guise, she splits open the universe and the Gods cannot help but assist her, as is evident from the moment you insert the CD.<br />Sinner's Prayer comes out full speed ahead with Joe Bonomassa's earth shaking guitar, almost like throwing a gauntlet down for Beth; which she seductively licks off of his strings as if Dante created the scene. It is hard to imagine the power didn't knock Joe back just a bit , when she sings `Keep on working child, oh in the morning' equally responding in turn as the two match scorching notes like dancing a fierce Bolero, but this is rock and this is how rock should sound, so listen if you dare.<br />\\"Chocolate Jesus\\" makes you believe Amy Winehouse is still alive and well, Beth convincing you that she is stepping aside in just the right moments, to allow Ms. Winehouse to return and sing those licks that she didn't quite finish when she was incarnated; for me this should reassure us that everything is in the hands of the<br />Greater Architect, don't lose faith.<br />At times, you here shades of Etta James, as in Beth's tear jerking rendition of \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\"; where you start to believe she has already jumped off the cliff and this is the last prayer on her way down, again, her obvious invocation of the God's an anguished plea in which Hades himself would have to acquiesce. Etta would certainly bow back, to the obvious torch carrier, who listened well to pay homage to the original songstress.<br />Though there are plenty of `nice enough' vocalists out there now, they mostly remind me of skipping stones on top of the surface, nothing deep and there is no soul baring, heart-wrenching artist's out there that has the vocal skill to equally deliver a song the way that Beth Hart can and does, on each and every song, every drop is wrung out, so there is nothing left to wring out of any single second.<br />I suppose if someone has trouble with intimacy, this may be too REAL for them, because Beth is the kind of artist whose delivery convinces you that the song was meant especially for you, it is YOUR song she is singing.  THAT is an artist.  That is someone who GIVES themselves over so completely, that the multi-faceted world parts its pearly gates and transcends worlds, unraveling the veils that were separating the soul until Beth Hart and Joe Bonomassa come along and tear down those walls and you find you are not alone.<br />By the time \\"For My Friends\\" comes ripping out of the speakers, all doubts have been utterly destroyed, that whatever life Hart as walked, she has walked it to redeem us all as one family, even a little of Toni Child's quivering timber comes out like some old friend to the rescue.<br />\\"Don't Explain\\" is nothing short of exquisite, where the soft Beth Hart has unwrapped the shell and inside, Billy Holliday has been waiting to reincarnate one more time, if only through Beth Hart, for you, right now.<br />By now, you have to get out the tissues, because as stated above, Hart is now ready to give you; \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\", she walks around the cliff with Joe, and the perfect rhythm laid down by Anton Fig, pounding the perfect beat, as if it is your own heart's plea to be listened to, before it breaks; only as anyone who has had their heart broken can attest; you only wish it broke, because you don't get out without it being completely shattered, but not to worry, Beth and Joe know exactly just how much devastation you felt, as they walk with you into the valley of sorrow.  You are not alone.<br />Now you are ready for my favorite cut on the whole album; \\"I'll Take Care of You\\", when all doubts are cast aside as to what Hart is actually doing; as she laments, `I've loved and lost, the same as you...you don't have to worry, you don't have to cry, I'll be there in a hurry to dry your weeping eyes'~ Beth does indeed take care of you.  Joe wringing out those pure notes, convinces you he is the only one who gets it too, you thank the universe for pairing these two for your own redemption song.<br />Moving back up-tempo, you are ready for complete disclosure; \\"Well, Well Getting To Know You So Well\\" leaves nothing left to debate, as only this honest and compassionate songstress could, you have been witnessed, your pain has been mirrored and your life is alive and well through the mysterious muse of Beth Hart.<br />Finally, you have arrived on the altar, and Beth has one more star that fell to earth to pay tribute to, and this one is as ballsy as it gets. Who would dare to pick up a torch that was lit by the incomparable Queen of Soul?  Beth Hart, and here too, she lets you know that even a queen can be honored by using the same gifts that made her the queen in the first place.  Yes, in this case I am talking about \\"Ain't No Way\\" originally brought to the top of the charts by Aretha Franklin.<br />Normally, when I hear someone trying to do a song made great by someone incomparable in the first place, I simply wish they hadn't tried, failing miserably and putting some cheap coating on the real deal.  That just isn't the case here, Beth not only takes on some of the best vocalists that ever lived, she redeems them all over again; reminding the listener and the valley of the God's that lives were laid bare, souls were offered up, confessions made and a whole lot of people have been ransomed, at the expense of one more extraordinary life ~ that rare brave-hearted soul that dared to steal fire from the Gods.  Beth Hart and Joe Bonomassa have opened up a volcano, get ready for their alchemical lava to burn off the dross and wake you into this world whole.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Even better than I remeber from the 60's...my granddaughter loved it and is still singing the songs.  Great music and lyrics...inspiring story!  Simply Awesome! (after all these years)

B0016CVN02|5.0|Great cd both for new fans and old fans.  I love Jumpin Jack Flash, Under My Thumb, get off of my cloud, all of them!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This series is gruesome, no doubt about that. If that kind of thing bothers you in anyway, steer clear.<br /><br />WIth that said, the story writing, suspense, acting, and effects are second to known for a TV series.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of &#34;scary&#34; movies but this is a little different. It's not so much the jump out of the dark kind of scary as it is just gruesome.<br /><br />Overall, it's a story about human survival. The desire of man to live and to protect those around them. Powerful and riveting — especially in HD.
B004TI5N38|5.0|An engaging thriller with a good hero and convoluted plot.  Surprises kept on coming.  Good read and I enjoyed it.  Now I need a nap.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This is basically a movie about a drunk/drug addict, not what i was expecting in this movie at all.  Very crude.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|No need to carry an extra alarm. My Kindle goes everywhere I go. Very uncomplicated, with just enough features to make it useful.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Title caught my eye,  book  not quite so much as I prefer  novels based in reality not fantasy. That being  said, it was well written and the descriptions of the circus were well done.
1449410243|5.0|I had recently seen the Oatmeal's comics via Reddit, and had to check more of them out. I saw this book on Amazon and bought it immediately. It had me laughing through the whole book with comics such as The Bobcats. Absolutely a must read for everyone!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book is a true pleasure to read.<br />It takes all the angles from UK, US, Russian and German &#34;Political&#34; and &#34;Regular&#34; life, and weaves them into a coherent story, which is fun to read while being educational at the same time.<br />A lot of the intricacies and the impact on many different groups in society was never clear to me until I read this. It also gives a &#34;neutral&#34; view of the German side of the war, clarifying the different population groups and their attitudes towards the War.<br />I even donated a copy to a German friend of ours, which I never would have done if I felt the book was biassed or insulting.<br /><br />This book is followed by Winter of the world, which continues the story line from the early 1930's onwards, and again was a read that was difficult to put down / turn off (I purchased the audio book for that one).  Read them both in sequence, and you may end up with a much more complete view of the two wars, just like I did. I made this a mandatory read for my teenage children.
1591396190|5.0|After several years of having this book I cans still say this is the best read I have made to get out of the ordinary.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This movie was fun and had good humor for the whole family. I especially liked the way they were able to use some of the old video game characters.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Typical, well produced and acted Bond drifting penny by penny into the  PC inclusion trap. Production values  and cine technique are over-the-top.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story kept me on the edge of my seat. I could feel the emotions of the Characters. I will read it again.
B003F17ZN6|1.0|This is NOT the Disney film you are expecting. It was done by Sony (note the Sony Wonder Film on the cover)in 2010 and is only 43 minutes long.<br />Terrible by Disney standards and only fair by high school computer animation standards. SAVE YOUR $.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game I play it to past the time. If you love horses you should definitely get this game.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|After reading all the reviews about the poor manufacturing on this product, I chickened out of buying it. It was too much money for that kind of a risk so I instead opted to buy the albums one at a time for ease of possible return.<br /><br />Listened to Help first and side one was beautiful but side two was terrible both in sound quality and massive amounts of skipping.<br /><br />I couldn't see any damage on the disc so I tried adjusting the balance on my tone arm, turns out it was WAY off balance (i just moved), somebody might has well have taped a penny to the head.<br /><br />Once I balanced it again so that the needle wasn't pressing down so hard on the record, it played perfectly.<br /><br />I wonder if perhaps some of the complaints about the quality of the pressings that others have had might be explained by poorly setup turntables.<br /><br />If you've got one of these \\"bad\\" pressings, try adjusting your system.<br /><br />The second record I got, was fine. Now I'm wishing I'd bought the whole set together.
B00A2LFXVI|4.0|Complimentary follow up to Part 1...very engaging story and interesting characters.  I would really like to see the story continued.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This book left me with wanting to reread it and try to decipher clues as to the ending. A first read from this author makes me want to buy his other works. An excellent journey into the little understood world of true insanity!  As with the Sixth Sense, I was unable to predict the<br />conclusion!  Will definitely recommend this book to my reader friends!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have been using a JVC car stereo KD-HDR1 with iPod adapter KS-PD100 since around 2005.  The cable drapes beside the center console and lays behind the passenger seat.  So, when I upgraded to an iPhone 5, I added the Apple Lightning adapter to this cable.  While I was able to get sound, I was not getting charge.  Apparently early iPods and their docks used 12 volts and until recently, newer iPods also supported this voltage as a legacy thing.  The Lightning adapter only supports 5 volts.  What the dockStubz or Scosche PassPort do is convert this voltage down and send it to the correct pins.  I did order the Scosche, but what I received from Amazon was a cheap knock off with no branding.  I decided to not even use it.  So I returned it and ordered this.  The CableJive arrived in retail packaging and, most importantly, it works!  Now I can listen and charge on my commute.  My battery is full when I walk in the door at work and I no longer fear running out of power on the way home-- BECAUSE I am now charging on my way home as well!  Also, part of my job involves occasionally documenting work with my personal phone when no other cameras are available.  The port on the side of this adapter, combined with the Lightning adapter and an extra micro USB cable in my glove box, gives me the parts I need to upload photos in a pinch.  (I could also carry a 30-pin cable with me, but I really have no use for that one other than to sync other iPods at home.)

0765325950|5.0|So I've read/watched quite a few epic stories that have spanned multiple volumes during my time as a fantasy fan, and I can tell you that at least 75% of the series end disappointingly.  Apparently, it's exceedingly difficult to craft a satisfactory ending to a story that spans thousands and thousands of pages.  Let's take a look at a few prime examples (beware possible SPOILERS of series you haven't completed).<br /><br />- Dune:  Holy deus ex machina, Muad' Dib!  So you have the holy grail of epic science fiction that fans have been waiting decades for, and what happens?  Brian Herbert drives a crysknife into your heart with probably the worst ending anyone could've come up with, that's what.  He may as well have had Paul resurrect dinosaurs and make an army of ghola raptors that he teaches the Weirding Way and face dancing, then lead his reptilian comrades to battle against the machine menace.  In fact, that sounds like a more interesting ending that having some mystical character show up and whisk the enemy into an alternate dimension.  Woof.<br /><br />- Sword of Truth:  Well, assuming you could get through the last 4 books of Richard Rahl's pedantic preaching, the ending of what was once a fantastic fantasy series sucks gigantically, for many of the same reasons Dune's ending blew sandworm chunks.  Completely unsatisfactory way of dealing with a villain who grew too big for his britches and a hero who became nearly omniscient.  Double woof.<br /><br />- LOST:  Remember back in season 1 when the producers promised certain things about the nature of the island, like \\"they won't all be dead\\", \\"it won't all be a dream\\", and \\"it won't involve aliens\\"?  Fast forward 5 years... Yeah, about that \\"they won't all be dead\\" thing.... Nevermind.<br /><br />- Dark Tower:  This one manages to stay fairly awesome until maybe the last half of the last book, when you fully realize King has no freaking clue how to finish his attempt at epic fantasy.  So instead of a grand confrontation between Roland (who, let's face it, is pretty badass) and the CK... we get a warm up \\"battle\\" with his son (Roland shoots him dead in a 2 paragraph fight, rendering his whole existence meaningless), a \\"confrontation\\" with Dark Tower's version of Sauron (who is just a feeble old man chucking hand grenades, and who must be painted out of existence for some reason), and a rare direct address from the author where he imparts the profound wisdom \\"life's a journey, not a destination\\" (i.e. my ending sucks... I know it sucks, you know it sucks, but don't you dare TELL me it sucks, you lowly peon).  Go pound sand, King.<br /><br />- Ringworld:  First book: Great.  Second book: still pretty interesting.  Third book: what in the blue hell?  I consider myself a somewhat literate fellow, but I have no freaking clue what happened in this book.  It's like someone took the absolute worst Buffy fanfic they could find, threw it into a bowl with a horny teenager, 3 bottles of vodka, and the desire to create the most disjointed piece of SF ever written.  Out pops the final few books of what was once an excellent example of enjoyable hard science fiction.  Which is sorely lacking in the SF community.  Go rish yourself, Niven.<br /><br />So anyways, back to Memory of Light.  I'm just gonna say it... it was awesome!  Sure, you can criticize points of it.  Did Sanderson mess up some of the numbers in the Last Battle (Aiel Wise Ones, for example)?  Most likely.  Was a 200 page chapter a bit much to take?  Maybe.  Were there unresolved storylines?  To some extent, but I think when used in discretion, that's a good thing (Rand's matrix-bending pipe-lighting?  Awesome.).  But on the whole, I freaking loved this book.  Major plotlines were well wrapped up, character deaths were shocking but appropriate, action scenes (basically the whole book) were well done.  And most importantly, Rand's battle with the Dark One was creative and satisfying.  No worries that he'll grin, snap his fingers, and say\\"Poof! Off to another dimension with you, Shai'tan!\\".  I closed the book satisfied and thoughtful, not hollow and confused (Ringworld), or filled with rage and venom (Dune), or wishing I could punch the writers in the face (LOST).  Sanderson did a phenomenal job in a ridiculously difficult situation, and he has subsequently become one of my favorite writers.  Congrats to him, and here's to a successful ending to WoT: a mainstay in fantasy for the last 2 decades, and now for years to come!  Praise the Light!
B00797MB0O|3.0|&#34;Young Adult&#34; follows the story of a woman who writes young adult fiction, and is coming to terms with past relationships that still haunt her.  Those expecting the cracking, witty non-stop dialogue from writer Diablo Cody, this movie runs at a more normal pace than &#34;Juno.&#34;  It's almost like Juno's next phase into adulthood, a slower pace, self-reflecting, dealing with lost loves and alcholism.  Good performance by Charlize Theron.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|It was just ok I liked the first one better but the effects were really good I wouldn't buy the movie though...
B0096I9UTE|5.0|I have been a fan of Kylie Minogue's since the late 80s, but even so I was still pleasantly surprised at how nice and lovely this album is. Kylie's voice has always been pop-friendly and pleasing to the ear, certainly every bit as good as Madonna's, but it just never seemed like it was made for anything outside of slick recording studio production and strategically placed drum machines. Her energy and amazing showmanship on stage might have almost been a distraction, at times, keeping you from wondering whether she could be both a talented performer and a talented vocalist.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong! She shines on The Abbey Road Sessions and makes a smart move in completely revamping all of her hits into something much more powerful. \\"I Believe You\\" is amazing...so beautiful and vulnerable. \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" transforms what was once a one-trick pony (who couldn't get that oddly hypnotizing song out of their head back in the early 00s?) into an actual song. \\"The Locomotion\\" keeps its original charm and then some, Kylie's voice sounding better now than it did in '87. Another stand-out is \\"Flower,\\" a tear-inducing track that will probably have you reaching for the tissues.<br /><br />I mean no disrespect in doubting Kylie's talent at first. She is not only a force to be reckonized with in the pop world (for so many of her fans she is more than just the European version of Madonna), she seems like an awfully nice person who has faced adversity with grace and style.
030758836X|1.0|It's been a really long time since I really hated a book. This was a selection for my book club. I kept hoping it would get better. It did not. The book is negative from the start. Nick Dunne is a totally unlikeable and unsympathetic character.  His life made me feel depressed. It's clear why Nick's only true friend is his twin sister. I could go on, but I won't.  I'm just happy I finally, grudgingly plowed through it before our book club meeting tomorrow. Ugh.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Very nice case, but a little heavy, although if you use the stand, not an issue.  I love the color!
0553801473|1.0|So, like most here, I'm a big GRRM fan.  We all loved books 1-3.  Feast left us a little... disenchanted.  But we told ourselves, \\"hey, no worries.  It's just a buildup to major events in book 5!  Martin is way too good of a writer to put us through that dreadful slump that many epic fantasy series go through once they extend past a trilogy\\".  And then we read Dance.  Hachi machi...  Allow me to tantalize you with a few highlights (mild SPOILER alert)<br /><br />- Jon and the Wall:  Gotta love Jon right?  The classic underdog, now assuming his rightful role as a leader and a hero.  He must have a compelling story to tell in this book. Right?  Wrongo.  Consider the Wall.  It's a fantasy writer's dream.  You've got a hoard of mysterious Wildings to work with.  You've got giants.  Skinchangers.  Mammoths, dire wolves, giant boars.  You've got an enigmatic red sorceress now.  Greenseers and three-eyed crows.  Real honest-to-goodness magic!  Dudes who love talking about how big their members are.  And to top it all off, you've got an army of frozen freaking zombies coming!  What does it all add up to?  The most boring location in the book, that's what.  How?  Because not a damn thing happens.  Jon dicks around chapter after chapter, accomplishing in 10 chapters what could've been covered in 2.  Labored reading doesn't begin to cover it.  Worst chapter:  Jon stands around for 15 or so pages and watches 3000 wilding walk past him.  That's it.  Compelling stuff.<br /><br />- Dany: How do you covert one of the most popular characters in the series into one the reader can't stand?  Simple.  Turn her into a whining, simpering girl who can barely decide what clothes to put on in the morning.  Yes, we get that she's still a young girl who is inexperienced (to some extent) with leadership.  But come on... She's commanded a hoard of bloodthirsty barbarian warriors, owns and controls THREE fire breathing dragons, has conquered at least 2 cities, is apparently impervious to fire yetstill easy on the eyes, has the blood of ancient royalty running through her veins, and earned the loyalty of thousands of people who barely know her.  I think that gives her enough confidence to not turn into a love stricken teenager for some tool of a mercenary captain, and instead get on with her war.  Worst chapter:  Dany walks through fields and fields of grass, eating berries and getting bit by ants while she thinks.  Her concluding chapter, by the way.  Awesome reading.<br /><br />- Arya's chapters: Unreadable.  I don't care about her training.  It's so damn boring I can't stand it.  Get her the hell out of there and back to Westeros pronto, comprende?<br /><br />- Unnecessary tertiary characters: Enough already.  Focus on the characters you have.  They're good, work with them.  Maybe add one or two.  But I really don't need to read about 10 more random lords or forgotten sons.  Get on with it.<br /><br />- Repeated terminology:  GRRM is somewhat guilty of this throughout the series, but cranks it up a notch in Dance.  Did he get a dictionary of obscure medieval terms and just fall in love with a few?  If I have to read about \\"nightsoil\\" or \\"leal servants\\" anymore, I might just declare this book \\"as useless as nipples on a breastplate\\".  I mean, I know \\"words are wind\\", and \\"if I look behind I'm lost\\", but how many words can you rhyme with Reek?  Maybe I'm just being a being a \\"butt boy\\" here.<br /><br />- And of course, the plodding pace.  Yikes.  I thought Ice and Fire would escape this, but it's falling into the same trap as so many fantasy series - Wheel of Time comes to mind - where the pace slows considerably, more and more characters are added, and you become less enthusiastic with each book.  Even in the worst of Wheel of Time books (and they were freaking bad, don't let anyone fool you), there was always some kind of payoff in the end: a big battle, a major magical undertaking... something.  Here we get... squat.  Maybe it's juvenile to expect someaction scenes in the book, and if so then I'm certainly guilty, but damn did this lack the balls of the first 3 books.  Deepwood Motte?  That's the best battle scene you can give me?  Inexcusable.  It hasn't quite reached Jordanian level, where an entire chapter can be consumed with 3 women arguing over dresses and the type of tea to feed a pregnant woman... but it's pretty damn close.<br /><br />To be fair, parts were still interesting.  I kind of liked Reek.  Tyrion is amusing as always.  But when Cersei's chapters are more interesting than Jon or Dany's combined, something has gone awry in Westeros.
0547133510|5.0|I bought the book to go with the Paddington Bear I found in  thrift store. She likes to sleep with the bear.
B00BHMF578|4.0|We enjoyed this movie but I think after all the hype we were a little let down.  Why does that always happen?  Anyway I enjoyed that it felt very accurate and I learned facts I had either forgotten or didn't know before.
B00B7FWWNA|3.0|It was a good movie with a very different subject matter but from the trailers I thought it would be more of a comedy/drama.
B007SXB498|5.0|Thank you Jane Austen for entertaining reading. You have made reading a pleasure. I enjoyed reading all four of your books.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Just like most free apps there are some things that you would need to spend money on to speed it up or get that certain animal. On the whole this game is great for free, so far I see no reason to complain.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Love the game. It's very addicting but it costs a great deal to just upgrade or expand the area. Also like everyone else I found the continuous tapping tedious and annoying. Would be better if the prices would come down.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|I picked a 5 star because it was what i was looking for not to expensive. I have not found any dislikes I like that you can switch from gaming to normal at any giving time by a push of the button yes i would recommend this product
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Easy mode is way too easy.  Then on Hard and Medium difficulties, he teleported right into me, leaving no chance for escape.  I saw him max 2 or 3 times in the few games I played, as well.  TL;DR not at all frightening, because he showed up so few times.  He kills you by teleporting into you.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Season 5 had some of the best episodes of the show in my opinion.  Darmok, Ensign Ro, The Game (with Ashley Judd), Conundrum, Power Play, Cause and Effect, I, Borg, The Next Phase and Inner Light are some of my favorites.  The show kept getting better with every season with the characters becoming richer and the stories more compelling.  A great season for a great show.
B000002KK2|5.0|Her music is comfortable to listen to. I love her lyrics and never get tired of listening to her smooth voice.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Great special effects, costumes and sets. Actions are very beliveable but plots can be hard to follow because there is so much going on at one time. The end of season cliffhangers are  annoying because of the long waits between the seasonal releases. Read the books years ago, then gave up on them when the author painted himself into a &#34;plot corner&#34; and stopped writting for years. Just hope he came up with an interresting ending.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I saw the movie at the theater.  It made me want to know more about the event depicted..  Then, I saw a Ben Affleck interview.  He said there was history on the DVD which could not be included in the movie, along with commentaries by the actual diplomats who were rescued.  I knew that I had to have it so I pre-ordered.  The story  is, of course, very interesting from a historical perspective.  If you haven't seen the movie, you should.  This DVD/movie is a keeper.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a great app addition to your Kindle Fire. .  Super easy to use and keeps you tweeting on the go.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I normal dont like zombie stuff or blood gory shows, or movies. However I have fallin love with walking dead just like the rest of America. Great show!!!
B005LAII8K|2.0|What a disappointment.  I could not even finish watching it.  Great concept but terribly executed. Extreme waste of talent.  Just a b movie
B005CKPQNE|5.0|There is nothing else to say.  This is one of the best series on television and once you start, you will not stop watching.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Every but of these long episodes kept me captivated. I went through this season in two nights! I really can't wait for the late 2013 release!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am obsessed with subway surfer, it's very very  very very very very very very very very very very good
B00881VLCE|3.0|The pictures are high quality. I play on Kindle Fire which might be a little small as I cannot play the smallest puzzle pieces.<br />There is a tendency for the pieces to get stuck while moving them into place and on several occasions the puzzle disappeared completely while I was trying to place a piece. Could not find a way to retrieve it and had to start again or not at all. But I LOVE jigsaw puzzles so I have continued to put up with this.<br />I do find the background color somewhat dark which makes it sometimes difficult to see the outline of the puzzle pieces. Would be nice if we had the option to lighten the background dependent upon the color of the puzzle.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I really enjoy this app!  I never have problems with it.  Easy access to all the rss feeds I'm subscribed to.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great book!  Great writing, well developed characters and suspense and intrigue at every turn.  Once you begin \\"Gone Girl\\", you won't be able to put it down.  Guaranteed.  I loved how the development of the story, alternating between the main characters was something different than I had read before.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The product more than meets our expectations with great sound and picture quality.  Just like seeing it on the big screen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it because it is fun for me to play. My friend josh show me it.  You should down load the app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000OPQ|5.0|Great movie, great soundtrack. A few dubs in there, but all comp CDs have those. Overall a wham-bam-slam 80s movie soundtrack. And let's face it, CDs are cheap.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Heard his new album on CSI New York -- had to get it.  The entire album s great.  The words are wonderful -- enjoy!!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Not only is it not scary,  it is also not entertaining.  I end up walking sideways most of the time and when I try swiping the screen to change directions I end up all over the place. Get this game if you scare REAL EASILY and like walking sideways, backwards, etc,  looking at the ground or at the sky, and could care less about being entertained.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For us that pain is part of life and that love is the best part of it this is a great book.  It points out that so many things we considered important are not.  Look in the mirror and like what you see, a thousand years from it will be nothing.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Excellent story of one woman's life.  It could make you laugh or cry!  I enjoyed the book very much! Buy Today!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|At first I didn't care much for the game but now I am super addicted! Only thing a I don't care for is now everytime I start this app there are advertising pop up that sometimes freeze up my kindle. VERY ANNOYING.  All in all I would recommend this app to others.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Well I gave it a try and I still don't know why I did. It, well, STINKS!!!! Colin Farrell as a tuff guy is hard to watch and the movie put me to sleep. I did restart it and watched the end and I did lose more of my life doing less then nothing.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|It was a gift for my husband and exactly what he wanted. It was reasonably priced and arrived in time for Valentines day.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Great story...I think I read it In 3 days...I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read other books by this author
B00004RFFI|4.0|Bought this years ago on DVD as I am a fan of storm chasers. Can't say I was disappointed, lots of action and cast of great actors, especially Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. Somw of the tornados come out of nowhere, such as the one at the drive-in theater scene, kind of cheesy. But that last scene where the monster twister comes at Helen and Bill is a bit overdone. I mean a tanker truck coming at them and it just flies above them, then they drive through the flames with their truck unscathed. Then they try to overrun it by chasing it through a corn field and the truck and Dorothy (the scientific canister that contains the balls to measure the twister inside. Of course Bill's truck is wrecked already so they just let the truck on cruise control run into the path of the tornado and bail out, only to find the twister has shifted track and they run for their lives to the barn, then the water main house and anchor themselves. A bit overdone, I think, an F5 tornado wouldn't have let them just hold onto a water pipe with some leather belts holding them in place. All in all though, it is 113 min of good, solid entertainment. HOwever, i really do think the reality series, Storm Chasers, does it the best chasing real-life twisters, but still Twister is a decent movie with never a moment of dullness, and it was nice at the end where Bill and Helen reconcile with that long kiss, that was touching.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Game is useless and has no real point. If only all the effort that went into the bogus ratings went into the game. Reviews are obviously the only thing that was successfully gamed.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I don’t even know where to begin; I loved this book, and thought it was absolutely amazing!I knew from the get-go this was going to be some kind of spin off of Cinderella, but in actuality this book is so much more than a re-telling. The plot was truly original!<br /><br />Our story takes place in the future, in “New Beijing” post WW IV. Cinder is a Cyborg (Gasp!) as long as she can remember she has always been a Cyborg. What that means, (for those of you who may not know, and don’t be embarrassed, because I definitely lacked a firm understanding of what a cyborg was until fairly recently) is that at some point she was all human, but due to what ever reasons, mostly an accident that lead to the lost of limbs or skin, Cinder now has some robotic parts.<br /><br />In the future, Cyborgs are thought of less than human, and all she knows is when she was younger, after her cyborg surgery, she was adopted by a family and is now left with an horrible stepmother who makes her work for her keep as a mechanic in the town market, and two step sisters.  Prince Kai (soon to be Emperor) comes into the market undercover, seeking a mechanic to fix his Android… And I’m sure you know where this is going.. yes there will be a ball.. but this is where the story stops being your plain old remake of Cinderella and starts being truly original.<br /><br />Me reading Cinder on Vacation - Katie<br />There is a devastating plague that is taking out many people in the villages. People close to Cinder, and Kai will suffer from this plague. The planets only help may be from the Lunars. Lunars were once regular people who colonized on the moon, but through the years, they have changed. The Lunars are rulled by Queen Levana. The queen may be able to bring an end to the plague.. but will prince Kai do anything to bring peace to our world.. Even give up his own freedom?<br /><br />Yes this story is Cinderella-esque … but that is only the beginning. If your looking for a poor girl, who is waiting for a prince to come save her, than this is not the book for you. Cinder is anything but helpless. She will do anything to help the ones she loves, include risking her life in the process. Cinder is a strong female character, and she won’t go down with out a fight!<br /><br />This book was AMAZING, Cinderella like you have never imagined!<br /><br />Check out more at Inkk Reviews<br />[...]her, than this is not the book for you.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is likeTwilight for tween's mothers - which is exactly what is was intended to be. I picked up this series not knowing that it started out as fan fiction & kept telling friends that it was like an 'R' version of Twilight! The story is entertaining but not necessarily well crafted! It is brain candy for entertainment.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|With the monumental release of this new Justin Hayward album, his first solo release since 1996's &quot;The View From The Hill&quot;, it also marks my 100th product review for Amazon.  Two milestones indeed!<br /><br />First of all, I absolutely LOVE the CD album cover photo!  Simply gorgeous!  Secondly, it is transparently clear that even at 66 years of age, Moody Blues frontman Justin Hayward still possesses strong talent as a songwriter and guitarist. Thirdly, this is a very deeply personal album, and Justin really has some heartfelt lyrics, and some are focused from an eternal perspective.  As he approaches his later years, Justin is wonderfully anticipating the eternal life hereafter, and it really comes through in some of his songs!  Also evidenced by this album, he certainly hasn't lost anything vocally!  His voice is still very tender, sweet, sincere, and pure.  Despite the fact that musically he has mellowed considerably with age, I NEVER get enough of this guy!<br /><br />As much as I love Justin's music, unlike previous musical efforts, this album doesn't flow all that well as a whole. Unlike his previous album project &quot;The View From The Hill&quot; from 1996, each song on &quot;Western Sky&quot; stands alone, and does not segue one song into the next. While gorgeous romantic ballads pretty much occupy the first half of the album, tracks 8, 9 and 10 are performed bluegrass style.  The last two tracks are shocklingly &quot;techno-pop.&quot;<br /><br />A detailed analysis track by track:<br /><br />Track #1 &quot;In Your Blue Eyes&quot;:  Easy pick for the album's opening track.  Bright, lifting, happy and romantic ballad, although the melody seems a bit repetitive.<br /><br />Track #2 &quot;One Day, Someday&quot;:  Hayward's strength has always been writing beautiful romantic ballads like this one, Lyrically excellent with lots of orchestral background!<br /><br />Track #3 &quot;The Western Sky&quot;:  At the opening moment of what is probably the project's highlight song, you will probably think you are listening to the end of &quot;Twilight Time&quot; from the Moody Blues 1967 breakthrough album &quot;Days Of Future Passed.&quot;  Yup, the chord structure is exactly identical, and probably intended!  This chord also closes out &quot;The Western Sky&quot; which is very mellow, melancholy, yet very hopeful, and heavenly Hayward magic with orchestral segments and acoustic guitar giving way to electric guitar in the instrumental middle. I have read somewhere that Justin wrote this song in memory of his brother Richard who passed away in 1986 of a heart attack.  Justin truly sings this number from the heart!<br /><br />Track #4: &quot;The Eastern Sun&quot;: Very mellow with light orchestration and acoustic guitar, and sounds like the sequel to &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; from &quot;The View From The Hill.&quot;  Also of note is another look back to an earlier Moodies-related album, as the lyric line &quot;somewhere there's children playing somewhere far away&quot; (from &quot;Broken Dream&quot;), the sound effects of children playing can be heard in the background on &quot;The Eastern Sun&quot;, giving the song a very pensive and reflective feel.  Simply a beautiful track!<br /><br />Track #5: &quot;On The Road To Love&quot;: If there is one song on the album that would be classified as both a straightforward rock 'n' roll song and comes closest to that full Moody Blues sound, this is it.  Justin co-wrote this number with good friend Kenny Loggins, and Kenny also supplies rhythm guitar and background vocals here.  The vocal harmonies and orchestration in the instrumental middle are simply breathtaking and the guitar solo outstanding on this wonderful uptempo track.<br /><br />Track #6: Lazy Afternoon&quot;: A mellow romantic number specially designed to leave your heart melting! Another gorgeous gem!<br /><br />Track #7: &quot;In The Beginning&quot;: I don't consider this cut to be one of the strongest on the album.  Some orchestration, a chorus providing dominant background vocals, and Justin's Gibson ES-335 guitar is prominent here.<br /><br />Track #8: &quot;It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart&quot;: Originally included on The Moody Blues 1983 project &quot;The Present&quot;, Justin sings lead vocal on this bluegrass style remake which was also included on The Moody Bluegrass &quot;Two Much Love&quot; CD released in 2012.  The first of three bluegrass songs on &quot;Spirits Of The Western Sky&quot;.  Always love these refreshing remakes of a Moodies classic no matter the musical style!<br /><br />Track #9: &quot;What You Resist Persists&quot;: Bluegrass tune #2 is a new song previously unreleased.  Years ago, who would have ever thought or believed that Justin would someday sing along with this style of music?  By the sound of it, he appears to be having loads of fun with this number!  The track also makes another reference to Justin's 1996 album as the song titles &quot;Broken Dream&quot; and &quot;The Way of the World&quot; are included in the song lyrics here.<br /><br />Track #10:  &quot;Broken Dream&quot;: This ethereal track was one of the highlights from Justin's album &quot;The View From The Hill.&quot;  Redone here as the third and final bluegrass track with Justin singing lead of course.  However, I still prefer the original version compared to this new bluegrass version, although this one is cool too.<br /><br />Track #11: &quot;Captivated By You&quot;: With the bluegrass songs set aside it's a return back to the romantic ballads and making the transition heading toward the end of the album.  I don't find &quot;Captivated&quot; particularly engaging, but Justin's vocals are always &quot;captivating!&quot;<br /><br />Track #12: &quot;One Day, Someday&quot;: Identical to track #2 above, except I cannot tell a whole lot of difference between this version and the first one except Track #12 is about 2 minutes longer.  Seriously, when assembling this CD why wasn't shorter version just simply deleted and insert another new song in its place?<br /><br />Track #13: &quot;Rising&quot;: Now entering the most unpredictable and puzzling section of the album.  The short 25 seconds of &quot;Rising&quot; is actually a neat cosmic intro for the album's last two tracks, but lasting a few minutes longer would have been more pleasing and an improvement.<br /><br />Tracks #14 &amp; #15: &quot;Out There Somewhere&quot;:  These are two different &quot;techno-pop&quot; versions of The Moody Blues 1988 hit single &quot;I Know You're Out There Somewhere&quot; from their &quot;Sur La Mer&quot; album.  The first version clocks in at under 3 minutes, the second at 8 minutes.  I was pretty shocked when hearing these for the first time, but with a number of listens I started to appreciate these radical departures from the norm.  Justin concludes this album in rousing fashion, as the closing track almost sounds like it was pulled from &quot;Jeff Wayne's Musical Version Of The War Of The Worlds&quot; which featured Justin's worldwide hit &quot;Forever Autumn.&quot; However, I'm also of the opinion that this final track is a celebration of his music, singing, and songwriting.  There is truly NO ONE like the amazing, talented spirit that is David Justin Hayward!  NO ONE.<br /><br />Most of Justin's fans will love this work despite the album's very uneven sound quality, covering everything from romantic ballads, a single rock and roll song, to blue grass, and then techno-pop to close out this project.  It almost looks like a desparate attempt to scrape together enough material to fill out this album.  Yet at the same time, it is hard to knock a musician like Hayward.  Coming out with anything musically at age 66, and the 17 long years since his previous project, we eagerly welcome with open arms ANY new music coming from The Moody Blues or Justin Hayward as a solo artist.  He has been, and always be my favorite male singer, songwriter, guitarist, and musician.  His devoted legion of fans will find tracks #1 thru #7, and #11 &amp; #12 here well worth the price of admission, and are the highlights of this CD.  And Justin, please don't wait so long with your next album release!  We NEVER, EVER get enough of you, whether it is you going solo, or with the rest of The Moody Blues!
030745455X|5.0|I am hooked on Stieg Larson's trilogy of &#34;The Girl&#34; series. Sadly there won't be any more of them. I've passed the books on to friends after reading them, which were just as into them as I was. It was hard to put the book down, once I started reading!
B0087URXZU|5.0|Love it. I can't stop listening to it. Joe hasn't lost anything over the years, in fact his vocals and guitar are better than ever.
B002B44KDG|5.0|This is a classic Neil Young album and one of his best; a definite tbumbs-up! I would decinitely recommend it to any Neil Young fan.
0061726834|4.0|Great Series! A must read for fan of Dystopian Societies !<br /><br />Check out my VIDEO REVIEW of Delirium on Inkk Reviews<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />under Review Archives
B00ANW33CM|5.0|3D Mahjong is  a lot more fun and interesting than the usual Mahjong games out there.  There is definitely more of a challenge to it.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|It's a fun game for everyone in my family.  It's easy to use.  I got the game because I saw a friend have it on their I-pod.
B000YIGNHC|5.0|Good as i remember as a kid. :) Mainly purchased it for the my dog skip dvd. The shiloh disc was just a bonus.
1451696191|5.0|Loved the book and the movie. I would reccommend this to a high school aged kid. I even liked the music.
B0062A5RUA|5.0|This greatly exceeds my expectations! Slash, his band really outdid themselves on this one and I daresay that is one of the best live albums released in quite awhile.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A monkey with a ball gag, handcuffed and flogged can do it, and so can you.<br /><br />If BDSM is your fantasy book, don't read this. There are much better books of any form, she says biting her lip, then a monkey lip, then a pigeon flavored statue lip, before saying oh no, yes, let's waste countless pages writing emails to fill space, you really hot kazillionaire who has no job, just soft core fantasies.<br /><br />Housewives, you can do better in writing style, originality and quality. And if you really need a fix get a VCH. Less painful than this read---way more reward.<br />I had to skip many chapters to see if there was any hope-but no.<br /><br />After being stunned by the poor quality, the crutches, (lip biting,) and unimaginative tripe-i began to think Andy Kaufman has been in hiding, scheming the biggest joke on us ever..it's flawless execution, and reaction that people take it seriously is evidence. But it is time to end the cruelty!<br /><br />Future victims are in danger of being subjected to the worst novel ever.<br /><br />There is no way, ho say, this could be for real.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Wow what a movie! That Oscar was well deserved, I have not seen a movie like this in a long time, it really kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time!<br /><br />Knowing the history behind this story like the Titanic movie did not prevent me from chewing my nails it is well crafted from the gritty look of the 70s film to the costume design, acting, script, historical footage and more.<br /><br />I give this movie a 5 star because it is a true Hollywood nailbiter from start to finish.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|This way of eating makes sense to me, as in the example of tiny tears in the muscle (damage) that makes it stronger, utilizing your bodys own healing mechanisms.  I look forward to gathering my own data as I go along!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This was a gift for my wife who is a huge fan of the show...she was ecstatic. Amazon delivered it promptly, so everybody was happy all the way around.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A sweeping tale, with multiple complex characters, set in troubled times. This book has everything to keep you riveted and waiting for the next piece.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Tough to really dive into a story as chopped up as the book was.  Still a solid piece of writing nonetheless.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|he is hot, the movie is wonderful, love Susan and J Lo<br /><br />def. a chick flick [but I am one so]<br /><br />this company was fast delivery, packed great. all good<br /><br />thank
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|You can only use it when you sign in. It is not a stand alone product, so it is useless for general note taking.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and ended up watching several parts over again because they made me laugh so hard.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's a fun way to keep me occupied:) I have no complaints  with this brilliant game other than I think the number of how many hats,guitars should be lower because only people who are addicted would unlock them.Also on Apple touch's the game is very blotchy...but other than that great job on the game and make more!<br />  -app reviewer.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love the complex story and the even more complex characters. This is a history lesson, with none of the pain!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This film had the misfortune of going up against one of the biggest box office juggernauts of last year in the hunger games. Much like Shawshank redemption it faced off against a box office juggernaut has been discovered in the aftermarket. I can't recommend thus film enuf a great Scfi action film and a classic that missed its window.
0634022296|5.0|I really enjoy this book and have since bought it for others. The chords and lyrics are accurate. I wish it said flat, so it would be best spiral-bound.
0977476073|4.0|An Amazing work of art and inspiration, that any civilian, military, political individual, regardless of being rich or poor, good or bad, must read!
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I love this game.  It's got the fun, of seek n find, and the creepiness of a murder mystery.  Boo!<br /><br />What I dislike, is sometimes, the object you are looking for, and what you are supposed to click on,are not the same.<br /><br />Example, in the loft one of the items is a Bicycle seat, but what you have to tap is a Western Horse Saddle.  Also in this scene an ear of corn can be the actual ear of corn on the left side of screen, or a sprig of wheat.
B005LAII12|1.0|The reviews were so good about this movie, and I wish I could say the same.<br />It was really stupid...I can count one out loud laugh, other than<br />that, it fell flat.<br />Sorry, guys!!<br />I expected more..
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This download is perfect for lists or any other important information that gets lost easily - I uploaded my movie list to these Notebooks so I can keep track of the ones I already have when I'm at the store.
B004SJUB8A|2.0|Johnny Depp great potential as an actor is constantly subdued in mediocre movie rolls such as this.<br />Absolutely this movie is a &#34;no-buy&#34; choice and I would go as far to say don't rent it either.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I liked this app and it really helped me know when my battery was at 100% and 20% with my personal settings...I just don't like how it beeps and wakes you up sometimes
B0031R5K72|5.0|Somehow, the tale of tragedy, loss, and pain is given an objective beauty when told by the grim reaper himself. He has experienced human suffering in all its extremes and still able to afford it an un-jaded respect. The innocence of the child, and her capacity for empathy and compassion in spite of her own tragedy, is so much more poignant related from this viewpoint. Countless books have been written about Nazi Germany and its cruelty and suffering, but Markus Zusak has created a work of awesome talent and importance.
B005HSL626|3.0|I feel like there are so many other great ways to spend your time.<br />I  feel this is  a  waste of my time.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Greta app to have on a trip or when you are not near your computer.  Has plenty of options once you learn how to use it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! My husband and I played the first Temple Run and really like it but can barely get a score over 1 million. This game is great for prizes, upgrades and being able to get a high score - we got above 8 million in the first week we played!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I didn't like this movie much but I'm not a Batman fan.  My daughter is a big fan and considers this movie as &#34;okay&#34;.  Not a strong bad guy character that you can hate.  A storage of revenge gone bad.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very funny I've never laughed so much in my life.<br />This is some funny stuff. Seriously funny
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I was expecting a thriller that kept me guessing to the last page. Not true! A good read but I was disappointed after the rave reviews. Sure, the plot took many twists and turns, but I was left wishing that it could just be over. Maybe less would've been more?
B009POHHRG|4.0|This was an awesome story.  You witness just how deranged the Joker really is and you also get provided with an origin story for the clown Prince of crime, which I found to be a wonderful addition to this book.  This is well worth the purchase price.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|While the shower stabbing scene is nowhere near as scary or shocking as it probably was 50 years ago, the movie is so well plotted and acted that it still holds up!
B00632HWOG|4.0|The Yahoo Mail app is great other than a few glitches. There are times when it will not allow me to the folders I have to check spam or drafts for example however if I am getting on just to check my email it is great.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|What a disappointment for a 007 movie!<br />This move is all talk and very little action. It comes across as a political &#34;do the right thing&#34; movie else the covert operations we perform won't be approved so lets just don't do anything and talk the audience to sleep with continuous rambling of what you can and can't do and are you capable or not James Bond to do your job and if you can't do your job we'll give you a chance and if you fail then we'll replace you and bla bla bla..... please END THIS THING!<br /><br />Boy am I glad I didn't waste money seeing this at the theater.<br /><br />Consider NOT renting or buying as your best option!
B00BHMETKC|1.0|cant beleiv they won so myuch at the oscars.  this movie was pretty disappointing.  could been longer and more in depth
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was an interesting book, but it didn't seem as good as the ratings made me think.  Just an interesting story, but I don't think more than that.
B004QBWU02|5.0|I have see re-runs of this movie several times and wanted a copy of my own.  The quality was excellent and worth the purchase price.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I am a sound technician just outside of LA. this product works hands down exactly how it should. I use it to connect my Apple TV to my system for wireless playback with AirPlay. The sound quality of this is great even when at a high volume (90-100 dB) which is where I would expect it to lose quality. It is extremely reliably and has not failed on me yet and I do not expect it to fail.<br /><br />As a tip, be sure to watch for the switch on the bottom of the unit if it does not work. Also, to any sound engineers, this is a line-level device, DO NOT make the sane mistake that I made when I got this, I had to buy a dual RCA to 1/4&#34; adapter and I use the built in attenuation when I use the Yamaha LS9.<br /><br />I use this in conjunction with an HDMI to AV adapter to view the visual output on my portable DVD player which has a composite AV input. I power both of these units together with a powered USB hub which provides enough power to both units. Hands down a great product.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very accessible and similiar design to website making the conversion easy and seamless. Great for looking at during lunch break.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I would rent this move, as I have already done.  I'm glad I didn't pay the price to see it at the theater.  It is a good movie but isn't as good as #1 and #2.  If you've seen the first two, definitely see this one.<br /><br />I would not buy this movie.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|was overall good and entertaining.  had good abck story.  th plot was good too.  this sucks as i dont like to rite stuff about the movie im only doing this so they will stopp emailing me
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. It was well written and I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for number three.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|ITS TO FAST. CANT SLOW IT DOWN. I LIKE THE TECHNIQUES I LIKE THE MOVES. I LIKE THE TUTORIAL GUESS IT TAKES PRACTICE TO GET GOOD AT IT
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so fun but after awhile my kindle started to shut off when I played also my kindle shuts off when I play game circle.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is great for giving me all of the information the website allows in a much more accessible manner.
B00000F14B|5.0|Anytime life gets you down just watch this and your spirits will soar.  No one could be unhappy after watching this movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once you start reading it, it sweeps you Long like a river, faster & faster towards the sea.  This is the 3rd of the Harry Bosch books I've read, now I'm going to have to read all the others.  Very enjoyable, believable & detailed.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I'm a big fan of Criminal Minds in general, but this episode is a standout for me because of one reason - Max Martini! I have loved him since watching The Unit, and he shines in this performance. I won't give away what happens, but it's really a good episode. If you like Criminal Minds, or Max Martini, or both, I highly recommend it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THIS GAME. ITS SO FUN AND ADDICTIVE AND YOU HATE TO PUT IT DOWN. EASY TO PLAY
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard ever! I use English and tagalog and the text prediction has no problems with me constantly switching between languages. A lot of people complain that text prediction is stupid... But not with SwiftKey!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|.....haven't finished the book so I'm not going to say anything. Amazon forced me to write a review early! Sorry
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It was a good movie and it kept mom entertained as well.  Cute concept.  John C. Reilly's voice is perfect for Ralph's character.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|We've all been hearing these songs on the radio for years but this is the first Fleetwood Mac album I've ever actually bought and the first album I've listened to several times from start to finish in quite a long time (we just don't listen to music that way anymore)... but it's THAT good!  This is also the first time I've listened to these songs with headphones and actually got into the music and genius behind it.  Classic groove that is missing in too much of today's music.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|scary as crap don't turn around.if your a Sissy your kindle or whatever will break first time playing.this is probably the best slender app because it lets you do day but if you like being scared go hard. and night.  x- 
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|GREAT GAME WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING TO DO. IO WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. THIS ONE SEEMS BETTER THEN THE REST OF SAME TYPE OF GAMES.
0062238868|4.0|Kinda slow at the beginning, but it was info needed for the rest of story. Good story about what military personnel go thru to support our country.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Scenery was very limited...whole movie took place in a dark apartment building/complex.  The plot was very weak and not very engaging.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What can I say... it's the Big Bang Theory.. always tops in my review!  Can't get enough of the gang.
0979019710|5.0|Very inspirational and motivational. Always a morning person to begin with and very focused and driven this book opened my eyes to what more I can do.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book, so sad to realize what happened to him. A true American hero! Would reccomend it to anyone to see what it's like in war.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|Always changing, never what you expect! I went years without watching this show, and am glad I have started! Full of action!
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I have purchased the set and it still goes on and on, never ending dead people to kill so much fun.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book written from a lawyers perspective. This book shows how blind one can be for your own son's wrong doings. Also what an impact the wrong doings of a child can have on a mother.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This CD is my favorite one of hers.  She has a very inspiring story and I'm thankful that her talent was discovered at the talent show.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I love this t.V. show and have since the beginning. In this 6th season, Sheldon seems to have gone through a personality change, though! He is much more &#34;glib&#34;, and I get the feeling that he is just reading line after funny line. When I am watching a really good movie or show, I never think about the writer behind the actor. In this season, I do, though.<br />I still don't like to miss an episode! It is so entertaining.
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|This movie was horrible. Dark message. No one who drank, smoked and trashed his body like that is going to live past 40 and it is hard to imagine him making any kind of a good mark on the world. I felt dirty just watching it and kept wanting it to get better. I not only wasted my money, I wasted my time.
B009PDO946|5.0|DVD MUITO BOM , COM EXCELENTE APRESENTAÇÃO COM ESPETACULO DIGNO DO LOCAL, PLATEIA E DATA<br />Blue-Ray IMPECAVEL QUER NO SOM, QUER NA IMAGEM
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This application is the best thing I have yet downloaded for my Kindle. I have 2 infants, and seem incapable at sitting at my desktop to do anything, so now I can sit in the nursery and still be on my desktop, or streaming to the ps3 in the living room, and moving folders and videos around. At the doctors office, I can open up documents to download and email to the office, instead of going home and printing then driving back! Love this app, SOOOOO worth the 5 dollars!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Spoiler alert: The long and detailed unraveling of the Krayoxx case set me up for an unexpected twist: maybe the plaintiff's last witness actually turning the case around or a former employee drops a thought-to-be-lost memo that proves a cover-up and all hell breaks loose.  But no, the case ends so utterly predictably.  How dull.  The lead-poisoning case ended well, I suppose, especially as it showed some gumption from David, but again, predictable.  And the breakup of the firm; who didn't see that coming?  Yes, it's a readable story that kept my attention, but I like mine with a twist.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased the book based on a review that I read on Slate. While the novel starts slow, it gradually pulls you in. Halfway through it, you're trapped with the characters and you don't want to break free! I recommend this book to anyone with an open mind.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|i like all of the songs on the cd. look forward to seeing the band if they ever play in the seattle area
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Just watch it, you won't be disappointed, I promise.  In my humble opinion this is THE best 007 movie to ever come out, and I've seen them all.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven was a great read.  It kept you guessing through out the book.  The characters were easy to fall in love with.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|While mostly battles, book two introduces the magic that frames the past of the seven kingdoms and promises more in the next books.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|What a way to find yourself - minus a few toes.  It was interesting how much prep she did with equipment in some ways but was so naive in others. Enjoyed the stories about people she met.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Just simply addictive.  Always trying to get those three stars;) Keeps your mind having fun. Will have you playing all day!!!!!!;)
B00A8307BG|5.0|i have several of cds that he's released in the past. i like this cd alot. i;ve seen him 8 times live through theyears
B00271HAK8|5.0|Back in the day, I enjoyed this movie on the big screen in theaters.  I recently watched it with my two sons, ages 12 and 14, who were delighted (not the word they would use, lol).  A classic, not to be missed.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|And so did I.... Vanillope is adorable !<br />Watched it many times without getting bored. Great family movie highly recommend.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Very exciting hard to put down. Continuing the great love story saga with Ethan and Lena. Page turner u will have trouble waiting for the end of this book.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|I really wanted to like this game more. There were good puzzles, a good mix of hidden object scenes, and a decent story, but it seems like in order to make the game last longer, the developer required you to back track a lot through scenes, and after a while it just seemed contrived and tedious. I can't really see myself playing through a game like this again simply because of that, and if it wasn't intentional, then the developer should have designed their puzzles better.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is addictive and easy to learn. But hard enough to keep up your interest. I would recommend the game.
B009GJCFL8|4.0|Great performance and good quality (sound and visual).  Wetton's in fine voice and the whole band is tight. Well worth the purchase price.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I hate television in general.  Truly I do.  This show is an exception.  I am a new fan as I recently discovered this series and I am having loads of fun catching up via viewing marathons.  Awesome!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Before I read this book, I looked at the many negative reviews of how this story ended. I will just say that in my opinion the ending was appropriate. This book was the best out of the three.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my. son is an animal lover and its the best way to give him an animal and have responsibility its slow loding but its a grate game app
B007REV4YI|5.0|Seems to be the best in terms of plot and action with Daniel Craig now in the role. It's certainly attention keeping.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|watching by yourself at night definitely puts one on edge...found myself looking over my shoulder more than once; and jumping o every noise in the house!
B007KOLNXC|5.0|My wife and I were watching Mad Men on Netflix after a recommendation by my Cousin.  We got hooked on the show.  When we finished Season 4, seems Netflix didn't have the rights to Season 5 yet.  Since we were already addicted, we had to buy Season 5 from Amazon.  We did.  No regrets.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|Kind of depressing graphics, low humor, unappealing. Why bother is what I say. And I have to write more words to put this on line so there it is.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This was a great book. It may have taken a long while to finish reading it, but it was totally worth it. I loved this book because it felt like I was watching these four girls grow up as I was reading. If you love coming of age stories, then this is definitely a must read for you.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This is an interesting way of looking at things and very helpful for all relationships. If the price is right, go for it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington does an excellent job at portraying a person struggling/denying addiction! John Goodman was also entertaining in his role! Well worth seeing!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|you may be scared by this if you are between ages 3 and 8 as that seems to be who developed this game. gameplay is irritating. the &quot;joystick &quot; is smack dab in center of view area. half the time I couldn't get it to show up so it was a lot of standing and looking around. when it did show all I did was walk around a dull open sparsely wooded area unclear what I'm even looking for
1457514508|4.0|When I picked up the book and began to read I had no idea where the author was going with it.  There were so many different stories going on at the same time.  I knew the area and knew some of the people he alluded to, which made me wonder how he was going to handle the stories.  Then it all changed and I had no idea where he was going with some of the characters.  The ending cleared everything up and I actually enjoyed being surprised as to who was behind all the murders.  I hadn't guessed and for me that was a change.  I look forward to a sequel and I think it would make for a good movie..
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book!!! Loved the first one....was shocked by the second one....and now off to read the last one....Can nit waut
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|this app does not work properly just loads and kicks you off or has to force close sounded interesting but kind of Sucks like most apps for the kindle
B007IXWL2C|3.0|If in any world so much could happen to one person in so little time, would like to know where. Felt the main character was nothing but an obsessed stalker and that the timeline in all 3 books was a bit unbelievable!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This cover is perfect for protecting my new Kindle Fire HD device. I wish it had at least one thumb pad on the side so the screen wouldn't get as many finger prints.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Good read, but no up to Pillars of the Earth.  Characters just did not come alive the way they did in the earlier work.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Taut, fast moving movie.  Acting was perfect for the situations depicted, dialogue was crisp and real; supporting actors made the movie.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an extremely addictive game where I get to spread plagues of different types and destroy the entire population of the world.  A friend introduced me to it, I can't seem to stop playing!  You earn genes and access to more advanced plagues as you go, so the game has a lot of variability to keep it interesting!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Awesome game very well defined hope more come out! Like to see more free games way to go amazon rocks
B009FZFONO|5.0|Once you start, you will day dream about he characters all day long. This coming from a girl that is not a fan of anything horror. I HIGHLY recommend it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows currently on TV. It is interesting and excitting. I would highly recommend this series.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|For a free game it is great. If you like the hack and slash you should give this a try.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is fun game if you are looking for a good game like the kind of Dragon city I like it because I can build my own city
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first got this game, I thought it would be like the other bad Temple Run..But it turns out, IT'S MUCH BETTER! I give it a 100 out of 100! Whoever made this game, Is awesome! Thxs Kiloo!
030771652X|5.0|No real suspense, apart from the last few pages. Still - beautiful, touching, warm, thoughtful,<br /><br />Was read in one sitting, most of the time with tears in my eyes.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|The game does a good job of reeling you in, but soon after there is almost nothing to do (and no way to expand your zoo) unless you want to buy hundreds of 'peanuts' to breed new animals and keep playing. Uninstalled.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have never loved a movie like this, it was very interesting and can't wait for many more seasons to come.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|A great 2nd part to the series..Just a nice series to watch & escape from the pressure of the out side world..
B005V5WBFG|5.0|McAfee works WAY better than Norton.  I caught a $200 virus when I had Norton. Enough said right?  I would highly recommend this product for all of your devices.
1616550414|4.0|As a long time Zelda fan I have been wanting to check out this book for quite a while and while I was afraid that the hype was too much, I'm glad to say that the book did not disappoint. While the beginning part seemed to have dragged on a bit too much only focusing on the latest Zelda game 'Skyward Sword', the book really picks up after that with the different timelines and great artwork! To top it all off there is a comic at the end that was just a great addition!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|No way anyone really finds this game scary. Or interesting. Or fun. I feel bad for those who actually paid for this. I also believe all of the 5 star reviews have to be faked in by developer.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I usually don't read about teenage characters but this was recommended by a friend.  It demonstrates the ups and downs of a teenager and it tells the other end of the spectrum, the unnoticed among us.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game! Try it you will like it. Fun and engaging. Kids. and adults will like it.  Very colorful with good and clear graphics.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|It's not Harry Potter of the Walking Dead or American Horror Story, but it will do.  I think it must be for a younger audience (I'm 43).
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|An incredible well put together show with an amazing cast of actors.  This show is not disappointing.  I love seeing the many aspects of Viking life, and how the Vikings were so much more than just raping, pillaging and plundering.  Not only do you have the excitement of the Viking battles, you also get a sense of their everyday family life as well.  An amazing show, on so many levels.  Clearly one of the best TV shows I have seen in a long time.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Okay I give this 3 stars for being completely engaging like the first two books in the series.  The cliffhanger at the end of book 2 was epic.  The writing was vivid and beautiful and exactly what one would expect with Lauren Oliver's work...<br /><br />NOW... Alex is back, Julian loves Lena.  There's a lot of action and the invalids and those in the wilds are trying to survive attacks and plan one as well!  I was completely engaged throughout the entire book and didn't want to put it down.  Then the end came and I kept going back and trying to find another page....<br /><br />It ended unfinished in my opinion.  I was completely disappointed with the rushed out ending.  After everything Lauren Oliver put into this book the ending was just not good.  There's no closure with Julian, Alex, Hana, Raven, Grace, nothing.  We don't even know what happened!!!<br /><br />I'm so mad at myself for reading this because it felt unfinished and now I feel like I need an extra chapter like this couldn't possibly be the real ending...
B0063IH60K|5.0|THE ONE THING I LOVE MORE THAN GAMES, IS MORE GAMES, SOLITAIRE IS AN OLD TIME FAVORITE. I LOVE PLAYING IT. i NEVER GET TIRED OF PLAYING THIS GAME.
0062227181|2.0|I can suspend disbelief with the best of them when the story is really good. Unfortunately, I found myself saying &#34;oh come on!&#34; out loud while reading this book. Character development & dialog were particularly weak. I give it two stars instead of one because, like watching a car crash, I couldn't turn away and did in fact finish it.
0143120530|4.0|&#34;Moonwalking With Einstein&#34; written by Joshua Foer is one of the bestsellers in New York Times. The title of this book is absolutely attracting and confusing. Is this book having any relationships with Albert Einstein? Or is it a fictional book? The answer to both questions is &#34;no&#34;. Actually, it is a non-fictional book, which introduces lots of people and techniques related to memory. The title, in fact, refers to a memory device that Foer used in the U.S. Memory Championship. It is a goofy picture that can help him to remember a desk of playing cards. Just like what the author said, &#34;If you try to picture Albert Einstein sliding backwards across a dance floor wearing penny loafers and a diamond glove, that is pretty much unforgettable .&#34; This book is an excellent book, which would tell the audience lots of experiences about the author and introduces plenty of cool memory techniques.<br /><br />Joshua Foer, who was born on September 23th, 1982, is a freelance journalist n the USA. It is surprising to know that &#34;Moonwalking with Einstein&#34; is his first book. He wrote it so well that he recieved $1.2 million advance for his first book. By doing researches for his first book, he won the 2006 U.S.A Memory Championship. For a young man like him, who is only 31 years old, his first book unsurprisingly popular and successful. While this nonfictional book is a little bit long with 11 chapters, it's such a pleasure to read it.<br /><br />This book is about Foer's experiences and introductions about lots of individuals and techniques. However, it is not a tedious book with plenty of complicated words and scientific works. Reading his book is like reading a novel. It is easy to read and understand. Second, for most of normal people with average IQ and average memory, they might worry about their memory in their daily life. Foer introduced to the audience a large number of people got their great memory just by training their brain. As a result, the book is like a hope to individuals. And it is enlightening, because after reading the book, the audience finally found the importance of brain training. He interviewed those people with unbelievable memories and he won that championship himself by doing so is pretty convincing. Third, although the book is more about his experience, it contains lots of memory techniques and he illustrates them effectively. Not like some of the scientific books, which always make people much more confusing! Forth, his book is organized so well. It catch people's attention by it's interesting title, makes the audience curious about memory. Then he introduces some methods of memorizing and his own experience of wining the US Championship. Therefore, it is an excellent enlightening book talking about memory.<br /><br />Although the book is pretty enlightening, it does have weakness. Even though the book introduces the memory palace, which is a technique to help individuals remember things by using amusing and interesting images, it does not tell the audience how to train their brain by using the memory palace. Therefore, it is not a how-to book. For the audience who want to learn how to do them, it is not a good book. Tony Buzan, however, wrote lots of books about how to train brain, For example: Use Your Perfect Memory, introduces a lot of memory techniques and he gave suggestions for improving memory. This book is about memory faces and names.<br /><br />In conclusion, it is an excellent book introducers lots of things that people do not know about memory. It is enlightening and gives people hope about their own memoris. The book is easy to read and understand, and you will feel like reading a novel. The author did plenty of researches and gave the audience all the useful information. But anyway, the book is more about experiences and introductions. If you want to learn how to use those cool techniques introduced in his book, you probably will be disappointed, because it is not a book which teaches you how to improve memories.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app that I have used! It is extremely user friendly, I love being able to download different versions of the Bible to use off line.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Best show ever, I can't stop watching it, it's become a serious problem in my life. My girlfriend is about to leave me because of it, but I still can't stop.
B006ZZANFG|5.0|I have these CDs in my car and have played them over and over and never tire of listening to them. It seems each time I am discovering them anew! The DVD has a beautiful quality to it as well and draws you right in to Loreena's concert as if you were right there in person. I love the option on the DVD to either play the concert alone or \\"take the tour\\" with her as she describes the location as she sets up each musical number. If you like new age music with an Irish feel to it, you will love this set!
1451678193|3.0|I'm working my way through a slew of unread books on my shelf.  This collection by Ray Bradbury has the Winesburg, Ohio and Olive Kitteridge sort of format wherein a group of short stories, each of which is able to stand alone and complete in its own narrative, are more or less woven together by common characters or geography.<br /><br />While a Bradbury fan, I found this book sad and cynical, without engaging characters or intriguing story lines.  Humans fly to Mars bringing all their strengths and failings--much more of the latter than the former--and play out the worst nightmares of the 1950's.  I don't suppose much has changed since then with respect to human nature, but Bradbury's skill as a story teller certainly improved in the years and books to follow.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|In this book you get a deeper sense of how twisted the Society has become. There's lots of new information that makes this a fast read. I enjoyed seeing into the minds of both Ky and Cassia. I hope they survive the next book and end up together.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating is that it is too short of a game, after you find all the pages you win. I did enjoy Slenderman but it was over too soon, I liked how it gets your heart pumping and scares you from time to time ! it keeps you looking over your shoulder to make sure he is not right behind you. And that will happen guaranteed  ! well done and the sound effects are creepy to. I thought they did a great job but made the game way too short :)
B0040I09RM|5.0|Normally I don't like the amount of profanity in shows but in this case it wouldn't be realistic without it. I am surprised how a person can start to sympathize and connect with bikers when you know their lifestyle but I find it happens in this series. I enjoyed it very much.

B00BLGZN1S|1.0|Om Sizemore has fallen a long way to appear in this one, just shows what drugs will do in the hands of the inexperienced.<br />There is a reason no one ever heard about this movie, how they kept on &#34;acting&#34; with a straight face is beyond me.

B001DUJNGS|5.0|This remains one of my all-time favorite Enigma albums.  The music is pure Enigma yet is very fresh and modern.  The sound can become quite dramatic and people really react positively and want to know what it is when hearing for the first time.  If you have the earlier works of Enigma you'll love this one.

B000J5XS3C|4.0|Good mic preamps, use it to run a condenser mic for recording bass. I also have used it to line in my guitar. The Eq's sound good even though i'll never use them, the board is pretty quiet for the most part. Feels well built. If you're looking for a budget mixer for home recording, this is definitely your mixer.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|It seems that those naughty sophisticated intellectual Europeans of 100 years ago were not casually naughty, they spent a lot of time thinking about it. On the historic side this movie introduces us to a young Carl Jung Carl a doctor first experimenting with the new Freudian psychoanalytic methods, his older father figure Sigmund Freud and the wildly hysterical Sabina Spielrein. These are three historical figures two known to us, one almost forgotten. In fact the three of them had some type of relationship although perhaps not as portrayed. There exists extensive record of close friends Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud and their breakup is a matter of historic record. The Russian born Sabina Spielrein did first enter this group as a patient and later as a leading light in founding the field of child psychology. She would know the two men quite well the record is not clear if she would become a mistress to either.<br /><br />Between the quality of the acting the costumes and sets this is a five-star movie. The problem is in the story line. Upon reflection it does not hold together. Specifically the arguments being presented by the principles and the principal visuals do not coincide.<br /><br />As A Dangerous Method would have it, Dr. Jung would become passionately involved with his former patient and provide her with the S and M sex she wanted.  To dispense with the sexual side of the movie Sabrina clearly enjoys her role on the receiving end of violent sex.  Carl is not portrayed as enjoying it very much. He looks to be experimenting with sex as therapy rather than a means of  allowing either himself or her to experience the freedom that is one of the central themes of the larger story.<br /><br />The inconsistency is that Dr. Jung argues that Freud is wrong in assigning sexuality as the single driving force behind psychology. However it is the sexual activity between Carl and Sabrina that consumes a very large portion of the movie. What in fact drove the breakup between these two founding giants. is that Dr. Jung developed a number of theories largely emphasizing elements such as racial memory. For racial memory to work people would receive particular impulses genetically. In the early 1900s there was no scientific basis for genetics at this level and the specificity of racial memory still sounds more mystical than scientific. Very little of the story line in A Dangerous Method covers or clarifies the their differences.<br /><br />The good news is that the principal actors Michael Fassbender (Carl Jung), Kiera Knightley (Sabina Spielrein) and Viggo Mortensen (Dr. Freud) perform their roles brilliantly under the very tight direction of David Cronenberg. Miss Knightley portrayal of hysteria and her transition into a trained psychologist are exceptional performances. The bulk of the dialogue of this movie is thought-provoking the sexual visuals do not support the intellectual themes.<br /><br />This is not a popcorn movie. The hysterical version of Sabrina makes demands on the viewer. The sex scenes whiel kinky are more clinical than titivating. Consequently the audience for this movie is going to be those who do not plan to turn off their brains, are not too committed to absolute historical accuracy and are not going to turn away at the first sign of a bared nipple.n these two founding giants. is that Dr. Jung developed a number of theories largely emphasizing elements such as racial memory.

B002O2THVA|5.0|A true king among westerns, and a must-see.  Nowadays they make them dirty and gritty.  Back then then they filled them with stars and the story was a simple morality play.  Lee Marvin is one of the best bad guys ever, and even makes Lee Van Cleef into a minor sidekick of evil.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Great story that brought a number of threads together from the series in creative ways.  Up there with the Wrath of Khan...
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Love this movie. It's different and silly but funny as hell. If you don't enjoy musicals or semi dark humor you probably won't enjoy this movie.

0743435729|5.0|Loaned out my copy years ago and wanted to read again. This is a great book to read, the entire series is amazing.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|A really enjoyable set.  Most of the recordings were very advanced for the time and still sound great today.  In fact, there are many recordings that I feel are better recorded and engineered than contemporary recordings.  There are some rare and desireable performances, too, that are no longer available on CD and may be hard or impossible to find on LP.  I've spent many enjoyable hours listening, making it a real bargain to buy.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Good book. Good read. humorous. Kept my attention. Easy to follow. Very much like any Episode of 30 rock. Quick read.

B002APU580|5.0|Pride & Prejudice is a lovely book and this production does it justice.  In the book, when Mr. Darcy FINALLY takes Elizabeth's hand, our hearts rejoice.  Toward the end of this production, when Mr. Darcy FINALLY walks across a gorgeous English field at sunrise toward Elizabeth, our hearts rejoice.  It's a beautiful scene and, as it should be, all is well!  Having loved the book for so many years and having seen every other production of the book, I am a tough audience, but Knightly is pretty much perfect in the roll of Elizabeth.  After Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, Macfayden was a bit disappointing at first for me, but he grew on me.  Brenda Blethyn is appropriately irritating as Mrs. Bennett and Donald Sutherland is appropriately scruffy, distant and even somewhat icky as Mr. Bennett.  Apparently the period details are accurate, but I did not see that Mr. Bennett in the book.  The \\"final\\" scene was a bit too much and a bit sappy.  However, all in all, no major complaints.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|After the sad closeure of FIREFLY series, Serenity does a nice finish.<br />If you forgot or didnt se Firefly, buy it and se that first this is the end of that serie or ??
B004P1JEWU|4.0|This book is a magnificent epos of a mysterical and troublesome fantasy world. The only problem I have is the fragmented writing style of George R.R. Martin which makes up a fantastic material for a movie or TV-series but it does get a bit heavy in a book. Anyway, this is a great book, as is the TV-series which is based on the books (even though I have not had the pleasure of watching the part made from this book yet).
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|Can't ask for more.  With Disney it is pretty much a known item, so as long as the product is in good condition, it is a winner.
0800141660|5.0|First, thanks to all of you reviewers who delve into details - story lines, character development and production values. I am reviewing the movie because of the way it makes me feel - lower blood pressure, faith that all will come out right in the end, respite from the travails of my world, etc.  This is a wonderful presentation of one of my favorite Jane Austen books with all of the players in exactly the right, believable roles.  I am not an expert on the period but Thompson makes me believe she and her production staff are.  For an Anglophile, the beautiful English countryside is as much a character as the players.  I seldom watch movies without some other household project going, but when the DVD arrived my husband and I sat down and watched this together over lunch.
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|Met expectations.  Our Grandson loved it.  The sound and the picture quality made it worth the purchase.  I am sure we will be doing this again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing because it always allows you to have fun and it gives you choices whether to update or keep the Same game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It provides for a great mindless diversion. Although you must be forward looking for opportunities to be s consistent winner._<br /><br />:-
1781164266|5.0|I'm a big fan of all the series of games, Dead Space, and it is waiting for when this book will be in my collection! This book covers all three parts of the story and makes it possible to observe a creature, such as characters, and the world series. Quality illustrations in large format with beautiful illustrations!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I went with 4 stars on this book for a number of reasons. If you like sci fi then get this quick fun read and sit back and enjoy yourself. Hugh is a relatively new writer and he is kicking some serious butt with this story about a post apocalyptic future where man is manipulated into thinking it is best to not think too much. He has a grand time flipping back and forth in time at the start of the book and weaves a number of ideas together into a mostly coherent story of purpose love and trust. It's no Hemingway or Joyce but it is fun and different. I wouldn't be surprised to see a film or tv adaptation.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|I guess I was drawn in by the publicity this book received. I found it to be poorly written and definitely poorly edited (lots of grammatical errors). There was a bit of redundancy and rambling within the book. The story was more the author's overall experience in the military than the actual story of this one mission. I found it to be boring.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lot of fun to play but a little slow to level up.<br />All in all I would still recommend it to friends
1926778103|4.0|The only drawback of this book - the lack of a hard cover. The rest of the book is good. Quality illustrations, with detailed descriptions of the characters, the world, weapons and items. I recommend to all fans of the game!
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I needed a simple mp3 player to listen to a single daily mp3 podcast from a website. It was able to play previous downloads.  But when I tried to download (from the kindle browser) a new podcast, Rocket opened but never downloaded the file. I could not figure out how to download my podcasts.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Disbelief, denial, love, trust then reality. Parental struggle is the key to this thriller. Mental health comes in many forms, both good and bad. Timely issues to be ingested and held close. A very well told tale!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|After watching the movie, I wanted a glimpse of the book. I really find it nice that this is available as an E-book. Definitely a nice, long read.
0062200909|4.0|Was expecting more from this book, despite the excellent cover and excellent quality illustrations, the book leaves much to be desired. I recommend this to fans wait for other publications.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the better books I have read so far . Nicholas Sparks hits love and how it affects people on the head . Katie , had to get out of her situation and finaly did . One thing that bothers me is there are situation in the real world like this everyday .  Have enough courage to get help early in your relationship . If someone hits you while you are dating that person . ( never see that person again in your lifetime ) . Call the police and get the hell out . Not everyone gets out some die in that situation .
1451695195|5.0|this book did not disappoint me.  i would recommend it for those looking for hope or validation.  like any book it's up to you what you take out of it
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I've read both Tolkien and Martin and thought i had a good idea of what the fantasy genre had to offer and picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend. Within the first 40 pages, I was hooked!  The story kept getting better and better as the pages flew by and the character development is intricately layered within the twisting and turning plot. I highly recommend this book, it has a lot to offer both fantasy veterans and newcomers alike.
1595827684|5.0|Very hard to describe this wonderful book a few words! This book fully conveys the best of what there is in the universe of Mass Effect. Including the story of the three-part series. Characters, worlds, stories. I recommend to all!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|What's not to love?  The tale incorporates legends of the highlands and holds attention throughout the story.  Characters are loveable--I'm especially fond of the father in this one.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1602901023 Julia's Quest]]<br />[[ASIN:1602900477 Light at Summer's End]]
0307352145|5.0|i happen to be an introverted person who has always felt i was in the minority for social behavior.  this book made me feel so normal.  it's a wonderful affirmation for us introverts [who happen to be a majority! .....  who knew?]
1936594234|5.0|For those looking for answers... this is the book.  For those lost... this is the book.  For those who are tired of life as they know it and want changes... this is the book.  Read it over and over again.  This is the book!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Provided me with several hours worth of entertainment!  Graphics were fantastic, and the story line was engaging.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Honestly, I'll give any movie a chance that includes Denzel Washington in the cast.  The story is good, with a great moral in the end...but there was something about the telling of it that seemed to drag a bit.  It works as a character study about a strong and capable, talented pilot, who struggles with denying his addictions.  In a profession where egos flare easily and stress can be high, I'm sure alcoholism can be a problem--for all involved.  It was encouraging to see the lengths to which the profession and the legal system continued to go to pursue the truth as well as justice.  No easy answers here.
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the whole series of books. Waited to see the movie. Can't wait for the sequel. Helps to have read the books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Me and my little cousins and nieces love this. We love taking care of the horses and training them for competitions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great game and all but I think that they should add a repeater like on the xbox version. but besides that it is the best game to build anything you want.
B0058EA3MS|5.0|When I first saw the film it felt slow and I found it to drag---BUT, by the end of the film, I realized how brilliant Mike Leigh (writer/director) was to tell the story exactly as it was told.  It is deliberate, the pace is perfect and well choreographed.  He takes the time to develop these three main characters (maybe four, the son is a critical character to the story, is the catalyst for Mary (Leslie Mansfield) to fully develop and shift).  The cast is brilliant, each character is wholly captivating.  These characters come back---they root in your memory.  If more people were as wise, healthy, strong, tough but kind as Tom and Gerri, the world would be a better place.  Boundaries are necessary for healthy living; taking responsibility for choices is paramount for healing.  I find that I return in memory to scenes with Tom and Gerri working quietly and calmly, simply, in their garden...their personal lives are deliberately peaceful and balanced.  It's a great film  I found that I had to own it.
1616550414|5.0|I'm pretty sure even the most casual of LoZ fans will find this book enjoyable. From the moment I opened the book, I knew I was in for a treat! I've been a fan since the original Gold Cartridge for NES and have played the games thoroughly, Cosplayed the characters and gotten into what might even be called &#34;Hylian political debates&#34; with other gamers about the series. So I thought I knew most of the things that this book was going to try and tell me. Boy, was I WRONG! I learned so much from this book it's crazy. The re-vamped timeline, the back story, and even the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; potions were not only well-written (or rather, well-translated) but also entertaining. I found myself so captivated in the lore that I almost suggested to my boyfriend that this book be placed in schools! EVERYONE should know what is inside this wonderfully put-together book. If not for the history, then for the amazing art, fun facts and commentary. I beg you, if you're a fan of the series, GET.THIS.BOOK.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoy everything with Relax Melodies.  I usually have a fan going all year, but with this I can play the oscillating fan.
B003L0HZ5O|5.0|A great album!!! I would definitely recommend the Black Keys in general; they are really a fantastic group. I hope everyone will enjoy them as much as I do!
B007QJAIUA|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie.  It's nothing more than five or six people living together and interacting from day to day, but it's such fun.  Highly recommended.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and each and every time I realize that I love it even more. Tim Burton did a wonderful job on this movie.
B008G33NFC|5.0|From start to finish is  extraordinary , you feel in a dark journey with music of the night. Tarja has done it again, lovely voice.
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|I haven't tired of this movie yet. Even though im not a baseball fan,  the personal relationships that dominate the movie help over shadow all the baseball references that are mentioned in the movie. The main characters are great in this movie; I'm beginning to enjoy Justin Timberlake as an actor. I would recommend that everyone watch this movie... over and over again!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Harry Bosch has got to be one of the great characters of all time. If you cannot find something in his dark, lonely, complex, exhilarating life to connect with, well then you are just missing it. After I finish reading each Connelly novel, I break out in a cold sweat because now I'm one closer to having read them all. Michael Connelly has a gift. Do yourself a favor and start opening it.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|great acting and story lines----characters real-genuine------watch it always even repeats....love costumes and early buggies,etc--please keep this show coming --thank you
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Very easy to very challenging puzzles. The format is simple.  If you like sudoku puzzles, this is a must -have!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn really has a gift for writing a book that not only is excellent but experiential. You feel what the characters feel and go through it all with them. For anyone who grew up in a dysfunctional home this book will be difficult yet cathartic. She is officially one of my favorite authors and Sharp Objects is the best so far!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It doesn't have all the features of a computer but I love being able to pop in and see what's going on. In fact, I just used this last night!
0060987464|5.0|I have read a lot of autobiographies but this one by fare was the<br />saddest one Ive ever read<br />Ive never bin more disgusted Paned or sad end all at the same time!
B004Y042N8|5.0|This is a collection of puzzles that you have to draw without picking up the pencil or retracing a line. Some are quite challenging.  It is a good game that you can play for a few minutes while waiting for an appointment or for longer times.  Works great on Kindle Fire.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|I've read a few Clive Cussler novels but not the Dirk Pitt series.  This seems like a reasonable representation of his work, but with a more comical twist that I wouldn't expect in his books.  Still it was worth watching.  It was well acted and directed.  Some historical fiction, action, intrigue; all of the stuff it takes to hang a good action movie together.  Some violence, disturbing images of affected victims, but no bad language, nudity.  Ok to watch with the family, but probably not good for small, or sensitive children.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love the characters and setting, but found the final episode highly contrived. The plot is sometimes too predictable, but I wouldn't miss a single episode anyway. I just wish it was a little edgier.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed the game and the graphics were very nice. The story line is interesting and follows the<br />action well. There are some HO screens that the &quot;touch&quot; does not actuate well. All in all a<br />good game.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|What a story! Inspiring and truly unbelievable. My 10 year old son is now a fan. We are going to download his music.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The game looks great and the sounds are soothing. Very enjoyable to play. The variety of levels is amazing. I highly recommend this game.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|There is no doubt that Justin Hayward is an extremely gifted individual.  Blessed with outstanding musical talent, songwriting ability and a voice that would put performers half his age to shame, it's not surprising that his new endeavor delivers more enjoyment than even this listener expected.<br /><br />Mr. Hayward has an uncanny ability to draw the listener into his compositions, to paint vivid pictures with his words.  One doesn't just listen to his music, you feel it, taste it, experience it.  And Spirits Of The Western Sky delivers a musical experience which elicits an emotional response from every facet of the listener's psyche.<br /><br />No one on earth writes love songs like Mr. Hayward and you will not be disappointed with his latest efforts...<br /><br />In Your Blue Eyes,  One Day Someday and In The Beginning are very well crafted, refreshing with lush, evocative lyrics.<br />The Western Sky is hauntingly beautiful and poignant with a captivating melody.<br />The Eastern Sun caresses the senses with a light and simple touch.<br />On The Road To Love is upbeat and original.<br />Lazy Afternoon is sensual and slow, exquisitely melancholy and bewitching.<br />Captivated By You is a study of both light and dark emotional attraction, pleasurable and intelligent in it's presentation.<br /><br />While listening to these songs you will sometimes be reminded of Justin's past compositions, a hint of Moving Mountains here and there...a memory of The View From The Hill or even Songwriter.  Signature Justin Hayward music which is sure to please those who appreciate his music and thrill his loyal fans.<br /><br />And then there are the songs which totally surprised and pleased me greatly.  I do understand that not everyone shares my opinion but, frankly, I found the following songs an unexpected delight.<br /><br />What You Resist Persists.  Extremely well written song but with a decidedly Bluegrass feel. Exceedingly good instrumental passages, clever lyrics and a strong, harmonic vocal arrangement give this song a very unique sound which brings a smile to this listeners lips and joy to her heart.<br /><br />It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart ...The Moody Bluegrass rendition of the song originally recorded on the Moody Blues album, The Present.<br />Broken Dream,  a rendition of the song originally recorded on the Hayward album, The View From The Hill with the same Bluegrass influence.<br /><br />While I love the original version of both these excellent songs, these compositions please me just as much. The Bluegrass flavor in no way detracts from the essence of the original but injects an earthy and primitive element which serves to broaden the appeal of these excellent songs.  As a Kentucky native, although Bluegrass isn't my favorite genre, I have a deep and abiding appreciation of the music.  And in this application it's extremely well done.<br /><br />The final songs....... Rising, which is a short musical bridge to......<br /><br />Out There Somewhere and Out There Somewhere (Raul Rincon remix) both of which absolutely took my breath away.<br /><br />The original, I Know You're Out There Somewhere is one of Justin's all time greats, a wonderful song and one of my favorites.  That being said, Out There Somewhere is sexy, sensual and vibrant, it makes you feel free, young and a bit wanton.  It beckons you onto the dance floor to use your body to communicate a primitive message of desire and attraction.  It refuses the idea that you are too mature to follow that calling, too stodgy to respond to the beat of the music.  This song liberates and stimulates the youthful side of our nature which is too often trapped or ignored in our daily routine.  I, for one, think the inclusion of this alteration was a brilliant idea and I give it my highest praise.<br /><br />After listening to this compilation, reflecting on every nuance, every turn of phrase and lyrical melody, I have concluded that this is Justin's finest endeavor, an undeniable success.  Mr. Hayward is still at the very top of his game and, it seems, still full of amazing surprises.  Spirits Of The Western Sky is truly Justin at his best.le success.  Mr. Hayward is still at the very top of his game and, it seems, still full of amazing surprises.  Spirits Of The Western Sky is truly Justin at his best.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Since you've probably read the synopsis of this film already, I will just repeat what many others have already stated in their very thorough reviews: This film is the best film of 2012 and will be remembered for being one of best films I have seen. Many reviewers have used the word \\"perfection\\" and I totally agree! Beautifully acted, directed and written. I sat through this filled with emotion. Just about every year, brilliant movies are utterly ignored by the Oscars; this is one of them. Loved this film so much, I just purchased the DVD. See it!
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|It is hard to believe, with all the technology and resources that we have in the movie industry these days, that a movie released in 1939 still reigns supreme over others of the same vein or any that try to duplicate, but it is true. \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\" was looking to change that. Disney originally had the rights to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" but sold them to Samuel Goldwyn, who in turn sold it to Louis B. Mayer, who created the original film. Now, it has run full circle and Disney brings us \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\", a prequel that explains the origin of the man who became Oz.<br /><br />Oscar Diggs, played by James Franco, is a circus magician in early 20th century Kansas. He's a shallow man. He's an arrogant man. He's a womanizer (they took a few liberties there). So when his time in the circus comes to an abrupt halt and his hot air balloon finds the heart of a Kansas tornado, he finds Oz, just the same way that Dorothy did. We go from black and white to vivid, 3D animation color. We've come a long way since 3-strip Technicolor.<br /><br />The beauty and 3D of the entire film are exceptional. The best part of the film was the realization of the Land of Oz like we didn't get in the original. Sure, they traveled the yellow brick road for part of the film, but we also get to see places inside the Emerald City that we could only imagine before. We get to see off the beaten path places in the land of Oz. We get to meet a little China doll girl who was the only survivor of a China doll city that was destroyed by the witch's monkeys. The imagery of the film is top notch. The effects that bring the witches to life and Oscar's friends are none short of brilliant.<br /><br />Bottom line though, if you're slapping 5-stars on this movie, your standards are way too low. We deserve better as paying customers. As I've seen a lot in recent months and years, the script doesn't match the visuals. The script is sluggish and dull, including the one pathetic attempt at tapping into the musical that the original was. \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\" doesn't even come close to achieving the magic of the first. The movie is unrealized and hastily thrown together, a money making venture.<br /><br />The writers and creators took a strange course that to me, proved very costly. Oscar a.k.a. Oz, is a ladies man. He woos nearly every woman he meets. The three women, Theodora,Evanora and Glenda are all smitten with him. Consequently, there's a lot of kissing. Not only is it hard to believe James Franco to be this person, it plays out like a television soap opera, cheapening and distracting the audience from what they truly came to see.<br /><br />\\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\" is a so-so way to escape for a few hours. I especially like the characters that Oz meets along the way; the China Girl and Finley the flying bellhop monkey. Yet, too much time was wasted building up emotional relationships with three different women and that left the scenes with the witches doing their nasty evil, in the sparse category. You'd think with something like this, Hollywood would have taken more time to make sure it wasn't just a visual treat and would have left sexual attraction on the cutting room floor.nto the musical that the original was. \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\" doesn't even come close to achieving the magic of the first.

B005BZQVJ8|1.0|It's had anti-Christian agenda that purposely use filthy language. Incorporated blatant, ugly attacks on Christians.  We shut it off in the middle.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I appreciate the historical information and detail in the book. However Follett's writing style and they way his characters coincidentally end up meeting and becoming involved in each other's lives seem a bit childish and unbelievable. Definitely not a &#34;must read&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is really fun to play  It's is so awesome I think it is a really great game to pass time with
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|So funny, I always get a laugh no matter how many times I've watched this. A little silly but still good entertainment.
B00723NWJE|4.0|This CD was different from previous ones, and I'd have to say that<br />I like her older stuff better.  &#34;Miriam&#34; is a song that really sticks with you,<br />in a dark and sadistic way.  Listening to the CD is relaxing and I think it<br />will make good pool side listening this summer.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|This was my book club's selection. Made it through the first 30 pages and decided that there are too many good books that I have yet to read, to waste time on this one.
B00138CYD4|5.0|Santana is one of the greatest.  When you hear a song, you know it is Santana from the first note he plays on his getair.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Award-worthy performance by Lennie James (Morgan is finally back!). Ingenious plot devices that even Robert Kirkman says he can't believe he didn't think of in the graphic novel.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Well this book convinced me that wheat as we know it today is pure poison to the body.  I stopped it about two months ago and it's not that hard.  Much lower appetite too.
1612183956|5.0|This is my first Blake Crouch book and I really loved it, fast-paced and very amusing, well written thriller, nice characters and you never know what's happenning until the end
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've had to delete a couple boring games, but this is GREAT! Always different &amp; l love that it has a help (idea) button!
B0061QD88S|5.0|i love this movie. it is very good quality. i have no complaints. sound is good as well. my kids love it as do us parents!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Dam you, amazon, with your faotd...just when I was getting tired! Hahahaha jk This game is by far the best one yet...this is a keeper! You GOTTA get it, you won't be sorry!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Just so a profound concept. Great insight on a lot of chronic issues that both me and my family/friends have suffered from.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|»Steal Like An Artist« is a great little book by Austin Kleon that gives good advice about working in the realm of creativity. Being it web design, art, code or design the book delivers as the author puts it \\"10 things I wish I had heard when I started out.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It is easy to read and it will contain at least a thing or two that you have never heard and it is always nice to get reminded about stuff you already know. On top it gives a few tips on how to be productive and it is packed with quotes from famous people like Steve Jobs, David Bowie, Picasso and many more.<br /><br />You can find lengthier review on my web site madeby.hm
B004G600A4|5.0|my kids are obssessed with rapunzel. this is a nice modern day age telling of the classic story. very current, very funny for kids and parents alike. very good quality.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I was looking for an easy and entertaining app that involved jumping and this one's great.  There are also a variety of other horse ownership related activities.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|The best series of movies yet.  I love Matt Damon in all them.  I also liked the way all the movies were in order. You watch one and the next one picks up where the other left off, and of course the ultimatum was the best.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great story line. We are totally obsessed! Lots of action, suspense and drama. You can really imagine living in this situation. Great actors.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Having read The Adventures of Tintin comic books as a youngster, I really enjoyed this movie. I hope more are in the works.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|This book jumped around to various places and times. Part of the book was interesting but the parts about Asia were not worth reading.
B00003CXC6|5.0|This movie is set in medieval Japan and features four versions of the same murder as told by four different people.  It is certainly not a mystery \\"whodunit\\" as someone else has suggested.<br /><br />The point is that there is no definitive truth but only relative perceptions.  The main difference between the real world and the movie is that the world does not contain four separate viewpoints but many where the majority viewpoint normally prevails.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes come from the version of the swordfight told by the woodcutter.  It is refreshing not to see swordsmen charge at each other without hesitation as we see in most other movies.  Here the swordsmen stumble and fall as such fights undoubtedly really happened.  Japan was only about a century out of its medieval era when this movie was made and such knowledge was probably still existent.<br /><br />I would minimize all the dialogue at the gate, especially at the beginning and end of the movie.  This movie basically speaks for itself and does not need any extra commentary.<br /><br />Some of the acting may be a bit overdone by today's standards but this movie is unsurpassed and probably the best ever made.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great insight of what really goes on in war. No propaganda, no politics. RIP Chris. It's a shame you were taken from your family.
B005USZML4|5.0|I really enjoyed all of Grisham's Theodore Boone series, with the 2nd and 3rd books being the best in the series.  I certainly hope he writes more books for young readers!
B000VOC90Y|4.0|Bag is very sturdy and has an amples number of pockets.  Straps are very comfortable. This back has been a life saver during my travels.  Well worth the 80 bucks I spent on it. I would recommend to anyone who wants to protect their electronics.
0060574216|5.0|Bought it for myself, then my boyfriend took it and read it too. He has come away with a lot of insight...
B003L5LEYW|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums right now. Nashville and Damian take real life situations/issues and turn them into and amazing work of art with a beat.
0345525558|5.0|My own life came to a standstill while reading this book. I feel like I actually met all the characters.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Always good so far. It has been worth it to upgrade. You can only get so far for free but not disappointed with the games made by them. Good mysteries.
B00005ASGG|4.0|Typical John Wayne Classic. Bought it for my father as a gift and he loves it...of course he is in hi 70's...
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Proably one of the best pictures with a great story about betrayal and deception..with a little revenge built in as well...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addicting no matter what your age is. I play just as much as the kids do.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I was frustrated that the &quot;free &quot; version didn't. even let you finish the chapter. If they had allowed me to finish, I would have probably bought another chapter, but I won't now just on principle.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is one you will never forget reading.  Being an avid reader who has read thousands of books, I can honestly say this one is unforgettable, and one of the most surprising ones I have ever read.  So many secrets and mysteries are revealed, and you have no clue about how horrible they are until near the end.  It grabs you from the first page, and you can't put it down.  You feel for the characters Sky and Holder.  How the author can write so convincingly about the tragedies in this book is hard to understand, but she does it so well.  And in the end, you are amazed at the strength and love that can come out of such life-changing acts.  This author has written a wonderful and heart warming book in spite of the subjects involved.  I will purchase her other 2 books, and can't wait to read them!  This book is worthy of 10 stars.  NOTE:  It's 6 months later and I just finished reading this book for the second time.  It is that good!!
B00BKEMX28|5.0|For me, I can't get enough of moody, erotic electro music and this delivers.  Puts my guests on a late Friday night right where I want them...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves this.  She gets so excited to buy riding outfits for both her horse and herself.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Peter Falk was an iconic detective and the conceit of the series - to actually show the murder and who did it - and then watch as Columbo put all the pieces together - and STILL hold your interest (rule of them: NEVER let the audience get ahead of the main character lest he seem dumb) was brilliant. the set includes all the seasons of the series plus all the TV movies - all in one box. Love it.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter is a whiz at this, yet the adults still find it aggressively challenging and fun.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I had to fight falling asleep.<br /><br />The title is misleading. It should have been based on &#34;The Master&#34; himself. Instead it focused on the life of &#34;the follower.&#34; With<br />all the &#34;hoopla&#34; regarding the misgivings of the Church of Scientology, since some claim this was loosely based on the life of L. Ron Hubbard, I just didn't see the controversy. Sure &#34;The Master's&#34; son says his father is &#34;making it all up.&#34; But for me there wasn't enough there to indict &#34;The Master&#34; for purposely misleading his followers, as many have accused Mr. Hubbard of doing.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job however, because I became thoroughly depressed watching his character.<br /><br />I wish I would have waited to see it on Netflix.
0425264386|4.0|Too bad Obama doesn't send Jack Reacher to Afghanistan.  He'd have the place whipped into shape in a week.  This time Reacher takes on a bunch of paramilitary weirdos who are taking over Montana and seceding from the Union, but not before a diabolical plot to destroy a major eastern city.  Reacher is joined by a highly-placed, beautiful FBI agent.  Will they both die trying?  Read it and find out, if you can't guess the outcome already.
B0050R0YB8|4.0|I got the toy in 1week. The seal was opened when I received it. Anyway the toy worth the price.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Cool and fun. Soothing yet interesting game. Nice music and sound effects. Good graphics not great. Well recommended for chilling out.
B00A5IXWR0|5.0|...and Breathless was the one that started a new phase in cinema history. It broke so many rules, oozed French charm, paid homage to American violence in film, and gave us two young stars. Belmondo in many ways was the first to make debauchery look cool and every new generation to follow attempted to come up with the equivalent to smoking in bed, dressing conventionally but with their own twist on it, and some memorable gesture as Michel did with Bogie' s.<br /><br />Whenever something breaks ground it never gets old because one must remember what came first.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|A/V: 9.5/10<br />Great blu ray. Worth multiple watches, and hi def rip was well executed. Very much a showpiece product.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game. Suspense throughout the whole game. Couldn't put it down. This is a<br />Must buy game.. Will be playing more of these games.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|love this show, cant wait to watch new episodes......will be watching for new ones to appear online, and get them ASAP
B00005QGAT|5.0|Before Usher, there was MJ, not Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson.  &#34;Off the Wall&#34; topped the charts for a reason, it was a well written, well performed, masterpiece.  This CD includes special commentary and studio edits.  A must have for the MJ music collector.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so good. I was on an emotional rollercoaster ride throughout the whole book! It is a book that you will not be able to put down!

B0036OP0QQ|5.0|I purchased this collection for my mother and must say it is a must have for the Whitney Houston aficionado.  It is the most complete compilation of her works and spans her entire career!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best show on TV right now. I absolutely love it and cannot get enough!! Must Watch for all!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. It's like way better than temple run. I love how you can buy new people and you can get all those upgrades. I also like the fact that there are different scenes to look at and play in.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|for the player doing a life sentence! that's how long it will take to figure this game out. it is a game for the person that has absolutely nothing else going on in there life. give the card game bridge a chance, it makes this game seem like a funeral.
B000002H38|5.0|I bought this to supplement my old LP and I must say it is great.  The clarity of sound and the sparkle of Anita Baker's voice set the occasion for strawberries and wine for the wife, and scotch for you.  Timeless music in a long gone era which included, Whitney, Mariah, Gloria, Donna, Patti Austin, and Patti Labelle.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three books. I couldn't put them down. This one had so many shocking twists in it. I actually yelled at the book when I got to the last page because I didn't want it to be over. Amazing!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it its great I think it would be a great game for anybody for kids and adults when your board at home
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I had a hard time finding the DVD for Season 2 in the local library, so I decided to buy it.  I'm happy with my decision.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|If Frank Sinatra was the Chairman of the Board, than Michael Buble is his rightful heir.  Michael Buble pays homage to the Rat Pack era musicians with a style all of his own.  Rather than mimic the era as many others attempt to do, Buble adds his own twist with varied arrangements and succeeds.
B007EECSFA|4.0|At first, thought the book was a bit slow.  After reading 40 plus pages, thought the story picked up and kept my attention.  At this point, I wanted the story to last longer.  Overall, I would recommend reading &#34;the Secret Keeper.&#34;
B00003CXPJ|5.0|What's not to like. Besides. That Hansel is so hot right now. Such a great movie. Surprise cameos full of models who are really good looking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game a soon as I wake almost every day just to play the daily challenge every day
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a funny story. If you are looking for a book to laugh and cry at the same time then look no farther. Very good read.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I decided to read Gone Girl after having several friends recommended it as well as reading some of the reviews.  I finished it today and all I can say is \\"meh.\\"  I'm not sure if it was all they hype surrounding this book or if maybe it just wasn't for me.  It took a long time for the book to get moving and grab me.  Even when I was interested in the storyline it still wasn't a page turner.  I hated both of the characters, not because they weren't well written or anything, they were just annoying.  I felt like a lot of details were repeated over and over.  Some of the twists and turns were predicable (could also be all those lifetime movies and crime shows I'm watching). I really wanted to like this book, but the ending was flat and I'm just disappointed.<br /><br />*** Spoiler  ***<br />PS I'm really sick of women using pregnancy as a weapon!  Thanks Amy!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|okay, I've been wanting this game for ages but didn't have any credits but finally free! worth the money I would have spent! pretty much Pc quality
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Got over 1 million feel so proud but probably there's people with loads but just trying to get all the eggs to get that awesome board thanks amazing game you've produce
B007CKNX28|5.0|It seems that Jack White does pretty much whatever he wants to do? If he wants to slash through hot guitar licks and scream like a madman. On the other hand, if he wants to do trills on the piano and couple them with hard edged but poignant vocals, he can do that, too. White pulls out all the tricks in creating a beautiful collections of music that covers a lot of territory.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|These men are heroes of mine and I was thrilled that the movie showed them all off so well and told their story so<br />beautifully.  The air sequences were just amazingly done and the story was so touching.  I loved it!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it!  Was a little hard to get into at first but then I could not put it down.  Loved her character.  I didn't want it to end.
B000I9WW6I|5.0|love seeing movies of times past, as in the story being told.  Kathy Bates was wonderful in this and the scene of her bashing the car in the parking lot - OMgosh, too funny- mainly because we all have been there and wanted to do just that!
B00136JS12|4.0|This is another great clasic album that anyone who grew up in the 70's and 80's will love.  Again the sound to noise ratio is significantly less on this than newer music.
B0000041CZ|5.0|Several reviewers have remarked on Gulda's \\"dryness\\",\\"attack\\", \\"eccentricity\\", and that, perhaps this is not an interpretation for first timers.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />I've listened to Gulda's \\"Book II\\" several times for the past several days. Replayed Gould's second recording and Richter's. Both of which are standard references for this supreme work. Richter is very elegant. Very beautiful. (Pity about the reverb. that spoils the sonics) Gould is Gould. Love him or hate him, you cannot get round him. A daunting musical intelligence. But I have to say that each time I came back to Gulda I was more and more impressed. Quibbling about particular tempo choices or attack dynamics sort of misses the point of this music, it seems to me. Other performers make other choices to get at other features of the music that strike them for their moment. (And often come back and change them for a later recording.) More important is the sheer musical intelligence and delight that is to be had from this Gulda performance. Book 1 for sure, but Book II is just very special.<br /><br />Unlike Richter's awful sonics and Gould's \\"singalong\\" Gulda's recording sonics are a joy. Exquisite piano preparation and mic placement. Works with ear buds, studio 'phones and speakers. Just awesome.<br /><br />Gulda was a truly great artist. But he moved from classical to Jazz and his own composing. Doesn't have a huge recorded repertoire, and provoked controversy throughout his career. Perhaps this is why he is less well known and doesn't appear on the usual lists of great performances of WTC.<br /><br />But please be in no doubt: This is truly one of the great readings and performances of WTC I & II) SO that's how he started. But it doesn't take a musicologist to just HEAR what happens. About a third of the way through the key progressions the teacher, Bach, starts to become the student, Bach. He's finding something in the process that is teaching HIM something new about the musical firmament. This is clear from about half way through and onward.<br /><br />Skip forward twenty years of banging out the weekly music requirement for the church at Thomas Kirk, plus the festivals, plus most of what we know and love. And then... And then he returns to that original idea of the cycle and what it gave him and does it again. Even in the last days of pain and anguish, blinded and dying, he returns to fiddle with and correct and adjust those final fugues. Now so much more chromatic. THIS is what Beethoven played as a young man. If Book 1 informed Bach's music for the next twenty years. \\"Book 2\\" had a significant influence on Beethoven's last piano sonatas and quartets. - If this is right we might listen to Book 1 and Book 2 for different musical insights. Seems intuitively reasonable?<br /><br />So I think the comment that Gulda might not be for a first time listener has a point. Pick a musician you trust and listen over and over to Book 1. Then to Book 2, and then go find Gulda, Gould, Hewitt and Schiff. You will be the richer for it. But do not miss out on Gulda. He has a lot to offer and you might be the poorer for not hearing what he has to offer. See the other reviews.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|I like the sleek design of this product that's why I was drawn to buying it aside from the simplicity of the color combination which are two of my fave.  It works well with keeping the wipes inside but what I do just to make sure the wipes stay wet, is to keep the original plastic container of the disposal wipes inside and remove the hard cover so it won't be bulky when you close this case:).  However, I wish the case is thicker than this so we can put a 72-wipe ct or more per trip just to make sure that we don't run out of supplies...I just had a big disastrous adventure for bringing in the number of wipes I could fit to maximize the case:(
B003GYEGNO|2.0|Gross, foul language dampened interest in reading this book. I did finish it believing it would finally take on a more complex plot.
1451695195|5.0|Where to start. I find it very interesting the range of response to Dr. Eben Alexander's experience. Most importantly, people are curious and picking up this book - and reading.<br /><br />And there-in lies the reason. Not for money, or notoriety was this book written, but simply to awaken us further spiritually. We are ready to hear this, as long as we are open.<br /><br />I could go on about how this book impacted me. What is awesome to view as a reader was the shift in Eben, his ability to see both sides of the topic, from his professional experience to his spiritual journey. I applaud and respect his honesty. And from his family, for his son to visibly witness the change in his father-his energy, that was very touching.<br /><br />I bought a second hardcopy to keep, and revisit. This book I have recommended to those I know are open, and those people have purchased, read, and want to discuss - a nod to this book.<br /><br />Books like this come along for a reason, thank you for sharing Dr. Alexander.
B0074V33MK|3.0|I can only base my heading &#34;Factual&#34; on accounts of other books I have read on the building of the Burma Rail &#34;The Forgotten Highlander by Alistair Urquhart&#34; and others. I bought this book with an interest in the meeting of the &#34;Railwayman&#34; and the interpreter of his interrogator 60 years later. It was worth reading this book for the story of that meeting and how it affected each of the people involved. With this in mind it was worth it as in my opinion we have to try and understand different cultures and behaviors and this book gives many insights to different cultures.as mentioned this is now 65 years after events and the world has changed<br /><br />However this book will probably be the last I read of the Burma railway as not to ridicule the torture and long term affects it has had on people and there lives the actual beatings and torture can only be repeated in so many different ways that it will hold the readers interest. To this end unless like this book there was an added facet &#34;the meeting&#34; I will not be reading anymore books of The Burma Railway.
B005B19UPE|4.0|Sarah's Key is a unique and compelling story about two families who are separated and at the same time brought together by the Holocaust.  The story is set in France during the German occupation of Paris.  Sarah and her family are taken by the French police, under the order of the Nazi's, to a holding place until they can be shipped off to concentration camps.  Without giving too much away, the story of the Holocaust is juxtaposed by a modern day family who is also living in Paris and ends up buying the old apartment that Sarah and her family lived in.  After several turn of events, the two juxtaposed stories twist and slide together.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed reading this book.  It is a nice easy and enjoyable read.  The events of the Holocaust are well written and descriptive.  I found the events of the modern family less enjoyable and a bit unrealistic.  One major down fall of this book is the ending.  Towards the end of the book, the author leads the reader to believe a new story line is developing, but then suddenly just ends the book.  I was disappointed by this ending and development of a new story line so close to the ending.  It was not written in a way that I felt like it was an effective cliffhanger.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book as a good summer read.
B00BEJL3IY|3.0|This film is just one of those films where you know it's not going to be great but its not going to be horrible either, thats what i thought when i went in to the theater to view this film. I had previously heard about the film being pushed back almost a full year from its June 2012 release date. But it didn't make me think twice about going and seeing it. What i saw did not impress me a all, considering all the time the film had to be made perfect.This film had major issues and major successes thats why its 3 stars instead of 2 and a half which i was originally planning on giving this film.Ok now to start actually reviewing this film. The first things are the good things and they are the acting, cast, characters, comedy, story, and suspence. Ok to start with the acting. The acting in this film from the trailer seems cheesy and fake, but its not it is actually good. The best of the lot are Nicholas Hoult, Stanley Tucci (as always),and surprisingly Ian McShane. Nicholas Houltis on the verge of star status , for me that is, because it seems like this film is going to bomb at the box office. But never the less, he seems to always dig deep into his characters as shown in his performance as R, a zombie with a heart in Warm Bodies. This timehe digs deep to find his brave, farm boy self inside. He does well, he isjust one of those actors who actually can act well. And making it seem like its not acting , that it actually is a person, or monster. And Stanley Tucci, heck who does not always enjoy his fun performances!? I mean i gave him praise for his stand out performance in The Hunger Games, and The Devel Wears Prada. He just makes me laugh all the time he makes me like him, and hate him, depending on his roles. He can get me to feel him. Now for the last one Ian McShane does well surprisingly as the brave king, who instead ofbeing cowardly and hiding in the castle stands out to fight. He is wonderfully cast and acted in the film. And as for Ewan McGregor and Eleanor Tomlinson well they didn't stick out. Their actring was normal, same old , same old. It was not special nor horrible either. Now ontop the cast. This film as i said before has an excellent cast, of mostly unknowns. The Highlights are Bill Nighy as the voice of the lead giant, Fallon. He puts great effort into his characters and succeeds in becoming a tough leader like voice fore a giant. He was well chosen for the part. And Ewan McGregor and Nicholas Hoult were also well cast in their parts. Even though Ewan McGregor's acting was not anything special he is still the only one i can see playiong his part actually. And Nicholas Hoult, well he is epic, in the part of Jack. He is a genuine, brillent casting. I can think of knowone that could play Jack as good as he could. Now onto the characters. The characters are very good. Though few in characters i, tend to like some of the characters and would hate to see them die referring to Jack, and Elmont. Now not all of the characters are develpt that great, but i'll get onto it later on in this review. The jokes are really good, they are very funny (while childish i may add) these jokes are just super goofy and perfect for this film. The stroy is really interesting and original. I never thought about Jack ever slaying giants or them com ing down here to eat people, or a crown controlling them. They brought interesting ideas into this film.The suspence in this film is high. I was on the edge of my seat as the bean stalk fell, and when Isabelle almost got slabbed in the head. I was like OMG, it was really crazy, and when the first giant appeared and the water started moving it kinda gave a Jurassic Park vibe to it. Now with every good thing comes a bad thing and this film has a few which include the screen- play, ending, animation, lodgic, PG-13 rating, and running time. Ok so the screen -play as i previously stated is pretty much a weak script. I mean you have like the bald guy come over, look down and say \\"where , where\\" i'm likewtf, and then he gets pushed over the cliff and killed. Wow. That is not good. The script is just way weak, and it effected the poor ending. There is not alot of giants, which caused me to turn on the running time as an issue. It also effects the character develpment of the supporting characters like Ewen Bremner as Wicke, Ralph Brown as General Entin, and Eddie Marsan as Crawe. Those characters are given very little develpment and are killed off like nothing. Come on whats with that i mean i know nothing about them and feel nothing for them when they finally meet their poor deaths. The screen-play includes mostly poor writing, with a couple cheesy lines thrown in for effect. The endingin this film is horrible. The whole film leads up to whats surrposed to be an epic battle between giants and man kind, but all we get is a couple tree throwings and thats it before they are all heading back to the sky? What the heck , it is a big disappointment to me. trhe film ends with no battle or anything. The whole film leads up to something but fails to deliver anything at the end. The trailers promise a epic ending but the actual film gives us non of the above. The animation is um, not great but not horrible. There was not alot of differences between all of the giants except for Fumm, Fallon, and the giant with its hair standing up, all the others are just bald and tall, they just didn't spend much time to different one giant from another. The animation also to me looked way to cartoonish and not very relistic, they just used way to much animation on their giants, way to much, it was overloaded. This film is anything but logical. I mean when the humans and giants are playing tug a war the humans almost won. And it went on for nearly 10 minutes. I mean two think that these huge big giants can't take on the ant sized weak humans is crazy. That part really upset me. This film seems way to tame for a PG- 13 film. I mean they could have shown the people being eaten like Ewen Bremner's character, and shown alittle blood coming out, they didn't half to show tons but you know atleast show it. Don't have all the eatings happen off screen or so fast that we don't catch it. It makes me wonder what happenes to those characters. Wow PG- 13 ratings have become really strict. Almost all films now get R ratings. The running time is way to small for this film. It should have been around 2 and a half, 3 hours, people could make it i know it. The script could have added more giants, and a long battle sequence, and more character develpment. And youknow more small scenes like exploring the jungle in the giants world more and finding giant monsters , some fun if you will. All and All this film had its highs and lows. It was really difficult to come up with a proper rating too. And finally alittle more praise on the wonderful, Nicholas Hoult, who was the star of the show. C+
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love Jane Austen and this was a great twist on her novel!! Jemima Rooper is a gem. A must have for your Austen movie collection
B00683JK9K|3.0|I haven't played it yet, but I hope to in the near future.  I did tap into it and it seemed a bit confusion, but then I need to toy with it to better understand the dynamics of it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My 5 yr old son loves this app.  There seems to be more functions that these birds do like have a light saber to fight those piggies.  The only negative is that after paying for the app, there are still some games that are locked and not sure if those are extra $ or they haven't been developed but that restriction frustrates my son.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Wow this film was a great rather long adventure, but its only the beginning, ha!!! This film unlike what everyone else is saying is trully a work of art. This film is sadly under estimated. Everyone is really just angry because they had to sit through a 3 hour film, but hey my motto is the longer the film is the more money its worth. Unlike the \\"Lord Of the Ring\\" series this film can be easily understood by people (like me) who have not read the book.I understand this movie might be alittle to much for everyone to like but if you clear your thoughts and just think to yourself \\"this is going to be the best\\", then it will be the best, but if you don't go in open minded you are going to find everything wrong with the film. Now on to the actual reviewing, i only have good news to review to you all. The good stuff includes the acting, cast, visual effects, length, costumes, new frame rate, and much much more. Ok the acting is excellent i loved it, the spotlight is on Martin Freeman,Richard Armitage, and Andy Serkis. Martin Freeman plays our funny little hobbit man in this jorney out of the three he is the best i loved him and his acting skills in the film, he put lots of effert into this film and he did well just as in Sherlock he is great in acting, and even though Andy Serkis is only in the film for about 20 minutes he uses his time wishly to make an impression on the audience , and he succeeds very well he is the most memerable acting of the three, and finally Richard Armitage, who gives a very realistic proformance, sorta a sad, angry man with mixed emotions , he really expresses his charactors emotions. Don't get me wrong everyone elses acting was great too, but those three stood out the most to me. The cast was.. Super, Peter Jackson knows what he is doing when casting the actors, every actor matches the charactor's personalitly , which is often rare but Peter knows what he is doing. The dwarf's actors looked like they would as dwarfs and its just great casting. The visual effects are so great, they are so well detailed, i meanman Peter score two , you made the monsters look so real, it is just so cool ,the animation is beautifully done, they looked like they were worked on for close to a year, it was just Oh My God great like Life of Pi. It was really good visual effecst that look so real, and well detailed that it looks like they are really getting thrown , or coming after the dwarfs. I don't know why everyone is always so angry and hating Peter Jackson's length in his films, everyone hated that King Kong was 3 hours, but i didn't i just thought it was even better, that we'd be able to see more excellent film. This film needed the longer running time to give us enough to walk out of the theater feeling like oh my gosh i must see more, ad its true that how i felt. The costumes were like really cool and well detailed , they looked really old fashioned and neat, they just blended with the actors really well and fit with the time period . Most people hate the new frame rate, saying that it looks to really or the charactors move to fast, well you want to know what i say? I think it makes it look great and more clear and realistic looking (in a good way) i just loved it. Really i don't care how fast the charactors can pick up items i don't pay much attention to that, i mean does it really matter? All i know is that it works - well. The only other things i have to mention is the goblin king scene , and the dwarfs. I found the line the gobin king says stupid as well as him being so easy to defeat. He says\\"well i guess it is that easy\\" when he takes a swing and Gandalf hits his head and then slits his belly like he was nothing but he was like huge. The other thing is they didn't spend any time really on developing the dwarfs, there are just to many, maybe if they had acouple die by the end then it would have been better but they didn't and that is not good. Well All an All The Hobbit was put in the hands of excellent people who knewwhat they were doing and actually cared about making this film a winner, (P.S i recommend seeing in theaters). A+
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|Great Krokus album. Does sound like early 80's. More like that than HooDoo. Classic rock, blues... Very catchy, but not cheesy. Good cover of \\"Help\\". Guitars are great on this one. Marc Storace is not aging at all.... Enjoy.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|quiet the novelity.  I enjoy playing it especially when traveling.  can the graphics be changed?  that would make iit interesting.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This a wonderful family read. You will cheer August on every step of the way and this book will make a difference in your life!
B004EPYZU8|1.0|Yuck what a piece of mess this film was man did i hate this film it was completely the exact oposite of what i thought this film would be. This film is just bad. One of those trashy films that directors think will make money so they put it in a good month instead of January or September where this film should have been. This is on my Worst Films Of 2011 list by far it is probably in my top ten now it is just yuck. How could a Director with a good acting and visuals mess this film up? Well i'll tell you starting with the good to bad. With the two things listed above being the only good things that kept this film from completely taking number 1 as the years crapiest film of the year. Ok so the two good things include the acting, and the visuals. Ok so the acting was really decent but the actors just looked to pretty as action stars there acting was excellent but as said before its not convincing if you look like a model. The only actress that gains both points for her acting and looks is... The Rising Star Jena Malone. She looks just like an action star and she acts perfect while acouple others to note are Emily Browning and Abbie Cornish while neither look totally action star worthy ( Emily Browning the main problem in looks but great in acting) they act excellent, Emily Browningthe better of all of them she just does not look the part , she did try her best but she is just to sexy and hot. Some actress's including Jamie Chung are not given alot of screen time to act in the movie they are just not in the film enough for me to recomment them or highlight their acting sadly. And so we move on to our next and last good thing which is - The Visuals. Ok so the visuals are excellent probably the reason why the film got a Solid March release date instead of an end of January release date. I mean the visuals look fantastic, they are probably the main use of the budget actually. The visuals are not ground breacking but they do look magnificent and the 3D shots with the visualeffects is pretty neat too. The visuals were well detailed as well with the creatures looking realistic in a cool and slightly desturbing way. Now on to the bad stuff people which include the script, the cast(i already talked about this so i will not say anything for it) the title (a rare catagory) the run time, the release date, the poster (also a rare catagory), the parts that are not action scenes, the director , and its sexist. Ok the script is by far one of the worst things to be included in this film, i mean the lines are stupid and one liner alot of times i mean god why did you give us this dreadful film that has little action scenes and takes place in a mental hospital a where women dance almost naked for men then the men pay for them and do it with themoh and girls are raped often. Yes that is the script and the action scenes take place when she is dancing for men Oh My God this films script sounds pretty stupid and dull to me and yes this film has alot of Sexist and Rape i hope you decide to skip the movie now its a waist of time which could be sent living and watching a good movie like The Hobbit which was amazing and actually good. Yuck !!! The Title for this film is just something horrible, thats why i decided to say something about it. I mean Sucker Punch wow its just stupid and has nothing to do with the film itself its just bad yuck i could have thought of a better title even my dog could have i swear!!! The run time for this film just dragges on and on i just can't handle it ,it is just way to long i now of some scenes that could have been cut to save time, alot of scenes actually to get the film to 1 hour and 20 minutes which i rarly support actually i usually critisise a film for being to short never for a film being to long but this film is just so dull and gloomy that it makes me want it to be shortened and thats saying something. The release date of the film was bad to i mean March 25th a solid release date and month no way nop don't waste thedate on thi \s crap, instead give it a late January opening where i'm shere it will make decent money against a mostly weak month yet still stay away from the good months which are for good movies not this. The Poster for this film was just such a lie most of this film does not have any action yet the film is being marketed as the next expendables movie. Come on who are these players playing this is just like the poster for Bednobbs and Broomsticks where they advertised the film as almost all animated scenes yet the film features about 10 minutes of animated scenes at the end of the over long three hour film come on, the best scenes were the animated scenes any way so wow. All the parts in the film that take place in the mental house place are dull, boring, and the worst thing yet i pray for the awesome 20 minutes of action that takes place all throughout the film man this film is just so boring. I never liked Zack Snyder at all he is just a horrible excuss for a director and it just so happens he also wrote this films script which i hated as well his films are just made to make money and are as boring as can be i swear !!!! And this film besides Mulan and anoher film whcih title i forgot was sexist. Men abuse the women in this film attempt to rape, and hit women and shot them and do any horrible thing they can think of to the women in the mental house it just is not right. This film needs to get burned its horrible !!!!! No women should watch this mess andthis film should only be sold at a xxxx store not at walmart this film does not deserve walmart at all. All an All this film is just crap and i hate it and i wish it was never created !!!!!! F
B0002YCVXI|3.0|Not as loved  as previous bought Ennio Morricone Cd's I have collected.. But I am not displeased that I bought it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I always enjoy the mahjong games, some are better then other as far as graphics and challenges.  I haven't spent to much time playing the games, but I feel that as I get into them they will be enjoyable.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I love that all the cd's are placed in a nicely displayed book form, with pages to turn. I am overall satisfied however my exterior casing had ripped in the center when removing the cover attached to it (by a stretchy glue), it is upsetting to pay about 90.00 on a product and it immediately look dis-satisfying on the outside. If it was not for this minor imperfection I would give it a fivestar rating, and would be highly satisfied with my order.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I don't listen to a ton of music but I do need something to listen to rather than radio while I'm driving. I at least listen to 5 tracks off of Heartthrob every time I take it with me so I consider it a good purchase. On my computer the AutoRip version has 12 tracks instead of the 10 from the audio CD I play in my car. The 2 extra tracks are not really that good so I don't mine.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love this game. It is difficult enough to keep me interested but not so difficult that it becomes frustrating. It works very well on my nexus 7 tablet.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is a great and scary game about slenderman obviously... don't listen to want the last guy said it actually gave me nightmares......... watch out someone is behind you... you have three option easy medium or hard.... and you have four playing areas the farm at night the farm at day the road at night and the road at day BEST APP EVER WOO
B000AJJNPY|4.0|Yep its sigur ros throw your money on the counter and freak out. Approaching this album with the expectation of a religious mind warp only to realize it is very polished, catchy album. The highlights are very memorable and fun to listen to. The body feels much like a continuation flowing together. If you are really shallow and love to follow all the sheeple, you will enjoy the album and experience emotional explosions. If you are discerning you will hear a very polished story of sorts that takes you on a melodious journey
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Why did sybil die? And mathew, it would have been the perfect show if the main characters didnt die. The story is really good and keeps you coming back for more.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Very addictive game just wish they weren't constantly asking you to log into facebook. Unlike the other reviewer I don't have a problem gaming on Facebook but it keeps telling me it can't link to my account.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is awesome. You walk through a farm or a road in search of 8 papers while avoiding the slenderman who pops out... don't look at him or you lose. I love it so much but be warned its really scary!!! Not recommend for children under 10

B009V3KKXY|5.0|I wanted to learn how to make this bracelets for a long time and finally found a great book. It have a lot of nice paterns, I enjoy to learn how to make this this bracelets.
B00BCQL7MG|3.0|I purchased this Walkure after listening for $.99 to Sieglinde's Du bist der Lenz.  In act 2 it was amazing to hear  real trills in Ho-yo-to-ho.  Kaufmann and Stemme were marvellous.  But Pape was disappointing as Wotan because his high notes were strained and consistantly cut short.  Many were thin.  He is a bass and Wotan is a high Baritone Role. Gergiev is very lyric and his conducting will take  some getting used to.  Gone is the bombast, the excitement in crucial moments--wotan's entrance in Act 3.  Brunhilde's entrance in the3rd act.<br /> None  of  these is the problem.  There are 46 tracks in the opera's MP Version and you get to hear each separate track as there is a hesitation between each one --sort of like in  the  old 8 track playbacks.  This is truly fustrating.  You wait for the climactic moment and there is a hesitation just before the moment is heard, as you've moved into a new track.  Plus in my download in Act 3, track 8 comes before track 7. Originally I thought track 7 was left out, but it's there---just after track 8. The download is $29.95, but for this download, it's a waste of money.  I'll buy the cd's which are incredibly expensive.  But I will buy the set on CD anyway to  listen to the singing, uninterrupted by the constant delays and clicking of the MP3 tracking .
B00B2270P8|4.0|I loved the extra footage that brought more from the book onto the screen. Of course like any book junkie, I fee like they always leave stuff out you'd want to see.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is an enjoyable game - the music and graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay stays challenging but isn't so hard as to be really stressful. My only complaint is that I played through it too quickly. I look forward to future levels being released!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Other reviewers have said it very well before me. This is a fine and worthy film to savor and enjoy - do not let the subtitles put you off one bit. Like it so much that I watched this movie twice AND wrote a review.  This film should have been in the running for best film for the Academy Award this year!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game isn't what you think. It is the legend you think. It is freaky and dark but I would say it should be about E10+ if it was a retail game
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Great book, but it proves once again, great success doesnt just come from your knowledge, but your ability to present and &#34;sell&#34; what you know to people.  You can be the smartest person with the greatest product ever, but if no one knows about it, or why they need it, you won't sell very many!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally recommend it. Since I read this book, I've been reading like crazy the other 3 books. It's great Sci-Fi for those who love it.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Few movies are &#34;must see&#34; films.  This is one of them.  Proves that, while the truth is stranger than fiction, it's also more interesting.  A truly noble, humble, good, just man who changed the world but not himself.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good book. Going the movie is just as good. Although Josh Hamel is pretty hot. G h f h f

B007REV4T8|5.0|We saw this in the movie theater and we had to own a copy of it.  We love everything Bond related so we had to buy it.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very inspiring. Proves that anyone can find hope even in the most difficult situations. I hope everyone reads this book.
B005BCE7II|5.0|I give it a 5-star because it's a great movie and I wanted it in 3D. The package came with no issues and the 3D quality delivered. I'm finding out there's more to 3D than just the shots that come out of the screen as much as depth. Overall this is a great fun fare for the family to watch together and would recommend it to anyone who has a 3D television.
0061733199|5.0|Very informative and very illustrated. I didn't think it was going to be that thick, so I was surprised after opening. Everyone should own this, especially those who are beginners. I highly recommend!!!
B0038P59A0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because it was a fast moving movie. I liked the interplay between Holmes and Watson: the level of care and respect shown by each character for the other was uplifting and not usually seen in many movies today. The witty dialog between the two also helped keep the movie going at a fast pace.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I &hearts;&hearts;&hearts; this app and would give it 10&#9733; stars if I could!!<br />Besides being Totally FREE!!...It's simply...AMAZING!!<br />It does just about EVERYTHING you can imagine!<br />Everyone that has a Kindle Fire should have the<br />&quot;PicsArt Photo Studio&quot; App!!<br />I would recommend this app to everyone!

B002PEP4SC|4.0|What a hoot! I stumbled on this book, and laughed my way through it. Love Fillion, but can't manage to watch the Castle program, after trying the first three or four.  This book is precisely what I would see his character writing. Clever, clever girls and boys...
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Good tv series dvd.  Anyone who has season 1 of The Walking Dead will want to own this dvd of season 2.

B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Although this at times was slow and strange to say the least, it was a fabulous glimpse into the film world at the time.  It was when things were really taking a swing, motion pictures where everywhere and studios were harsh in selecting the next blockbuster.  Hitchock was a great film with great composition/lighting and acting.  The story was complementary in the way it was entertaining and new... It let us see how director's even those as great as Hithcock can struggle with the next best thing.
B005R32L66|3.0|I installed this, I have no reason why! I thought that I would use it, but so far I know no one who has it on their computer.

B009MO5E10|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre and really enjoyed it. I was a foot walker for a while which is someone who takes packages from the bike couriers and brings them into the buildings so the biker can speed on to the next delivery. I could relate!

B007REV4YI|5.0|I have been a 007 fan since Goldfinger(which I consider the Gold Standard of Bond Movies). I have almost all the Bond movies on DVD. Craig looks like Steve McQueen and seems to exhibit McQueen's screen persona. The story was well written, the action scenes were toe curling. This Bond seems to put thing of Bond's past to and end, especially his personal possesions. I knew this was a good Bond movie because my wife, who doesn't care for these movies, was impressed by this one. The next Bond movie better come with it, because for action, this one now is the gold standard.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Very happy with this purchase - it was a film from my younger days, which i know i will  enjoy watching again!! It was received in good order and well packed and on time!!
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought the Katniss Everdeen doll for my granddaughter ,who was very happy to receeive it.<br />The doll arrived in perfect condition and I was very satisfied with the purchase.
0062014536|4.0|Is this the ending you desire, so that you can close the book with a smile on your face, say &#34;I knew it&#34;, and file it in with all the other predictable happy endings? Not so much. Did I close the book, with a mystified look on my face, screeching &#34;seriously?!?&#34;... Not at all. The theme of the story is bigger than any of the characters individually, even with how well they are written. And I think that's the point of the ending. You aren't left entirely hanging and wanting, but it isn't handed over to you on a silver platter either, and isn't that the point of the whole series? Nothing is!! The main character of the story, the struggle, the suffering and loss and determination felt triumphant in the end, even if every character's storyline wasn't happily and neatly resolved. As much as I read to enjoy the escape and appreciate a tightly wrapped bundle of joy delivered to me at the end of a story, I can also appreciate a story that makes you climb, exhausted, and feeling fulfilled, if not entirely satiated. The ending feels true to the characters, and the story. And in that way, it truly satisfies.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I really like this movie, it is well done and not just another boring version of Peter Pan. This is Johnny Depp's most unique role for sure!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is one of the best books I have every read. Though it starts off slow, it sucks the reader into the book<br /><br />I would rate this book 5 our of 5 stars
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love the varied games this offers and the changing<br />degrees of difficulty although I can't always understand<br />their move choices. I find I am constantly challenging<br />myself to &#34;just one more game&#34; to try to beat it! Enjoy!

B006RXPTNM|5.0|If you want to see film acting at its best this is your movie. The play isn't really anything like the film. And the story is only sub par. But the acting is amazing.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|This adaptation of Frank Miller's hallmark Batman book is excellent.  The production is well cast, is true to the spirit of the source material, and a much more enjoyable/engaging story than Nolan's last Batman movie.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|See the movie.  There are complaints about its accuracy towards the Canadians<br />(the complainers say the Canadians took a more active role),  but this is a &#34;popcorn<br />and pop, make out with your wife or girlfriend&#34; medium, not social commentary.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great app and I love that it's free<br />I have so much fun playing this game. Everyone should try it

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show, the characters and the never ending drama in Downton.  The clothes are incredible.  I genuinely care about the success and failure of the characters.  Even though thismshow has limited violence it still keeps you entertained and wanting  more.  Excuse me I must be going,  Carson is here to dress  me for dinner. :)
B005KAH7QU|1.0|Euro trash, can't believe Blanchett did agreed to do this movie.  It tried to be a version of the Bourne theme and failed.

1572814136|5.0|The colors are very rich and pictures clear.  The booklet print is not too small to read, which is really nice.
B00ALCBTWU|3.0|The film has unnecessary subscripts as to the locations, as the scene informs you where they are at. Also the opening gives you the basic plot. A group of men are trapped behind enemy lines post Battle of the Bulge and find a great weapon being developed by the Nazis. You could have figured all of this out by yourself- really.<br /><br />What makes pseudo histories are the characters. This film concentrated on one particular character, sniper Nate Burrows (Chad Michael Collins) pretty much to the exclusion of everyone else. Vinnie Jones was a welcomed addition. Some of the scenes worked well, while others were simply bad, making this a very haphazard production. I loved the scene of the killing of the German soldiers done to the opera of \\"Faust.\\" Shades of \\"Clockwork Orange.\\" However, the CG graphics of the planes and gun fire flames was noticibly fake. What really hurt this film is that they squandered dialouge which should have been better utilized to build character rather than conceal it, as in the case of the main character.<br /><br />Makes for a rental for Vinnie Jones fans. Vinnie knows bar fights.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Brief \\"Witness\\" style nudity (Melia Kreiling who plays Bathsheba in \\"The Bible\\" mini series)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American Hero. He is now gone but will not be forgotten. This book really talks about the reality of war.  Not the war we see and hear on tv.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|great book!!! sad that this is going on in the world and very few seem to care..will highly recommend to all.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is a kid and adult book I like this book . This is a great educational . I
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|This is a bold artsy unorthodox version of the novel. If you are not a fan of indie, stage, and symbolism to the point of absurdity, this isn't your film. The theme of the novel is &#34;no one may build their happiness on another's pain.&#34; This takes on a duo meaning as it not only shows us this in personal life but in the class differences in Russia. The stage is the first major metaphor/symbol you will notice. The aristocracy live their live on the stage. It is a world of drama, make believe and one that will soon draw its final curtain. The workers are off stage and live in the rafters and audience supporting the rich. Who is really happy?<br /><br />The locomotion movement and sound represented the emotions of Anna, thrusting when she feels raw passion and falling silent at the end. In addition to the symbolism, the film has the irony of Anna attempting to patch up an infidelity relationship only to fall into one. Perhaps inadvertently, the novel portrays how women are trapped inside a man's world.<br /><br />Konstantin seems to represent &#34;us&#34; in this film as he is a man who freely travels between two worlds as he seeks his happiness. While prudish, he is constant as his name suggests.<br /><br />The themes and symbolism are very heavy. Like reading a Russian novel, you feel your head explode as you try to take it all in. Not for everyone and you should know after 10 minutes of viewing.<br /><br />Parental Guidance: No f-bombs. Near male nudity. Artsy sex scenes.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is such an amazing read. I finished it in one day. I was genuinely invested in these two beautiful characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that it is soooooo awesome! My sister  had it on her KINDLE FIRE and I got it on my KINDLE FIRE. If you have trouble with it,delete and install.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was amazing in so many parts. It got you thinking of what you were doing in your life and why it meant so much to you.  It is just written beautiful. At first it was odd and hard to follow for the reason it was it a letter form but I think if it had been written any different it wouldn't have had the same effect on the reader. It's now one of my new favorites.
B000NTMWYU|5.0|Albert Finny only has a small part in the beginning of the movie but everything in the story rests on the scenes with him and Freddie Highmore as young Max. Both are excellent actors and set the stage for the story. Love the nostalgia<br />A little different movie for Russell Crowe as Max Skinner  Max goes from rich (he's got money) to wealthy (having the best of life). Marion Cotillard plays his love interest and does an outstanding job presenting her character a beautiful, smart business woman who loves love and life. The supporting actors Abbie Cornish & Tom Holland played the otherside of the coin - a match that didn't make it. Both added a funny interesting element to the story. This story runs in pairs  with the exception of Albert Finny and Archie Panjabi. Archie plays Max Skinner's Exc. Assit. and she keeps Max on track. She adds a depth to the story that moved the story along adding punctuation to Max's drama. The 3rd pair are characters Francis & Madame Duflot played by Didier Bourdon and Isabelle Candelier. Both are well known for their work in France, Didier is also a screenwriter and film director. They play the Vigneron (vinter) and his wife to takes care of the house.  Together they make an unforgettable pair of supporting actors that round out the story.<br />Go see the movie only if you want to see Max get what he deserves (what each of us deserves) and you like a romantic comedy.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I like the game overall.  It's just that at times it hangs up and I can't close it down until it asks me to wait or close down.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I wont repeat what other positive reviewers have noted but wanted to report how much I enjoy this DAC/headphone amp.  I use it as a DAC on my laptop at home and as a headphone amp with my iPad when I travel. Note that the e17 does not work as a DAC with the iPad.  For the price, build quality and functionality, I think the e17 is top notch.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Loved the story, didn't even noticed the animation (quality was great didn't distract from story or characters). Was happy it had a strong female lead - great for all our daughters

B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|While this may be one of the better mobile attempts at recreating Slender, it still doesn't achieve the same sense of dread and panic that the original PC version does. My biggest problem with this version is that slender man doesn't truly follow you around. Instead he will randomly pop into your view for a cheap scare. Instead of being scary, it just comes off as lazy game design.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've already watched this movie 3 times and have the soundtrack memorized! I didn't know that I'd love this so much but it is the combination of the incredible cast, beautiful singing and timeless themes that makes it so captivating! I'm still upset that this movie didn't win all the Oscars it was nominated for but its still amazing! I plan to buy this DVD when it comes out so I can watch it whenever I want!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Much of it was written way over my head.  It seemed to bounce back and forth between the highly technical, educated writer and a level that made it easier to understand.  I can imagine this doctor's frustration at trying to convince his fellow scientists of what he experienced.  It also seemed like a pitch for his organization to delve into these kinds of experiences.
B000001GXC|5.0|. . .Karajan, that is.  There has been a tendency since his death to undercut his achievements as a conductor -- too slick, too refined, too controlling, not a nice man etc. etc. -- but in a Karajan performance, there's always a sense of purpose and direction, and usually excellent orchestral playing in execution of that purpose.  The two Beethoven sets (from the '60's and the \\"70's), the late Sibelius symphonies, the Dvorak eighth, Bruckner, Wagner, and Puccini -- and then the Mozart operas from the '50's.  Love him or hate him, he was a great conductor and he served the music.  I picked up this Mendelssohn disc used and very cheap, for the last thing I need is another Scottish Symphony, but I'm glad I did.  First of all, the 1971 sound is unusually good -- air around the instruments, strings not screechy, all of the instruments heard -- and then there's the interpretation itself -- lots of energy after that grave start, but in no sense is the rawness or rusticity of the music prettified.  In what I think of as the \\"bad weather\\" music in the first movement, Karajan lets it all hang out, and throughout that movement, I think he gets the \\"agitato\\" character just right.  He carries that over effectively into the third movement  (after the brief, delicious second), in a reading of sweetness and depth, with the climaxes driven home forcefully.  The final movement is a delight, and the great ending, with its whooping brass, is right up there with Maag's great version of 1957.  The other items on the disc -- \\"The Hebrides Overture and the \\"Italian\\" symphony  -- were recorded with the Third in January 1971.  They too are marvelously done.
0802473156|5.0|Just like The Marriage Builder, by Larry Crabb - the 5 Love Languages should be required reading for anyone thinking about getting married or anyone who wants to improve their marriage or any significant relationship they are in.  Very quick and easy read yet so powerful - don't just take the quiz to see what your love language is, read the book too.  It is so inspiring and explains why this is so important.  We all need to love our spouses, friends, kids etc in the way THEY need love so they will feel loved and lovable.  Well worth the time.  God bless you!
B007SGM084|5.0|If one wants to run away from reality and dream of doing things that don't seem proper this book is the one.I wanted to see what the uproar was all about and I am glad I did. I just couldn't put it down. It is trully a non conventional romance.
B009AMAK54|5.0|Even in his 80's Clint Eastwood still has the acting chops he had as a young man.  This is a terrific story of a father and daughter, once estranged, who reconnect through a mutual love of baseball.  They realize how much they love one another as the father (played by Eastwood) begins losing his eyesight) and his daughter, and attorney, helps him as he scouts prospects for the Atlanta Braves.  She proves herself every bit as good a baseball scout as her father when she discovers a young pitching prospect.  Justin Timberlake is excellent as an opposing scout who falls in love with Eastwood's daughter.  This is an excellent family film and one that can be enjoyed over and over.
B00AYF5SHQ|5.0|. . . . \\"it\\" here being the balancing of the solo violin in relation to the orchestra.  Tastes differ, of course, but to my mind, this is about the ideal balance.  The violin doesn't come across as larger than life in relation to the orchestra, and yet both have plenty of presence.  This really matters in what is for me the highlight of the this disc -- the slow movement of the Dvorak concerto, which has a lot of different features to it and a lot of variety within it, but in which the violin always seems to be in conversation with some group of instruments from the orchestra in an almost chamber-music-like way.  It helps too that the orchestral colorings in the movement are beautifully realized by the sound engineers, and the whole thing proceeds in a way that isn't self-displaying on the soloist's part.  Neither does the finale offer a lot of opportunity for virtuoso display, but it's an almost irresistible sequence of slavonic-sounding dances (with some repetitions, to give the whole some shape), and again Fischer and the orchestra cooperate beautifully.  The Bruch concerto is more of a known quantity, of course, but here too the sound balance is good, and Fischer creates a unified expressive effect over the first two movements.  Her sound is slighter and she employs more vibrato in these movements than Accardo does (for Masur, 1977), but that seems appropriate to the slightly withdrawn, introverted character of the music.  She brings plenty of spirit to the finale.  All in all, then, highly recommendable -- I didn't own a Julia Fischer recording until I bought this, and I'm glad to have it.
B00BKEMX28|5.0|I chose this rating because I can't stop listening to it. Much like anything else TRez touches.<br /><br />His vocals with Mariqueen's on this album mesh really well and I heard parts of her personality shine through more than ever before. I was pleased with her range.<br /><br />I want to hear more, much more.<br /><br />Too late, all gone is the reason I bought this album.<br /><br />I disliked the length. I wish the EP was not included--great EP, but I could have heard more along the lines of Welcome Oblivion songs to fill up the remaining 6.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who loves good industrial/trip-hop like NIN, Sneaker Pimps, Massive Attack, Aphex twin or Coil!

B000HZD168|5.0|I remember watching this on ABC back when I was a kid. The special effects and so forth for the time were superb and attractive to a 5 year old. As an adult, I find the story line one of the best of it's kind. I feel that the later Star Trek movies (including the two from J.J. Abrams) have tried to re-capture the magic that this movie brought to the Star Trek franchise (the villain out for revenge for a main character plot). I believe this is also the best performance of all the Star Trek casts.<br /><br />Now only if they would bring out the Extended Edition on BluRay or HD streaming, I would be happy. The theater edition misses the fact that the boy who died by staying at this post is in fact Scotty's nephew, which is why he was so emotional when his nephew died.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I received the product fast.  Ordering was easy and no hassle.  I haven't watched it yet.  If you are interested in something more than the &#34;typical series&#34; than watch Downton Abbey.  Great Series

0525478817|5.0|Oh, John Green. You really need to stop making me fall in love with your characters.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is as depressing, heart-wrenching, lovely, wonderful, and well-thought as I'd imagined it would be. Hazel and the supported cast of characters combine to make a horrible situation, albeit one that's been written about before, into something unique and not entirely hopeless. While not everyone will get what they're looking for if someone's searching for a perfect plot or ending, I think every bit of this fit in perfectly.<br /><br />First off, I have to say that the characters made it what it was. Augustus, Isaac, and Hazel were definitely my favorites, but I also loved all of the parents, those random characters that popped in for two sentences, Isaac's little brother (and I can't remember his name). Each had their own quirks, exaggerated features, personal hopes and shortcomings and flaws. No one was perfect. Thankfully. They were as real as a reader can hope to get.<br /><br />While at some times I had no idea where the plot was going or what was going to happen next, I didn't really care. I just wanted to learn more about this budding friendship, about Hazel's health problems, and what life could bring her. There's no sweetening of the details here, or brushing over of the more technical or depressing parts. I liked how the reader is there with her through thick and thin.<br /><br />If you want to read this, don't bother trying to prepare yourself. Dive right into it, and let it take you on a ride you'll never forget.<br /><br />DEVASTATINGLY DELIGHTFUL. 5/5 stars
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved this book. Read the whole series in about a week. i loved the characters & the places described in the book. never a boring chapter!
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|It helps when you implant the ideas of math in children's minds early on.  You can't give the full story of algebra when they are 7, but you can give a few good examples of it, and those ideas will stick there for years, and when they really do start doing full-on algebra they'll have these ideas to reinforce their education.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|i originally got this as an app on my phone, realizing it was a little too big to run correctly . I Then downloaded it on my Kindle, my 4 year old daughter absolutely loves MLPs and Loves this game. I do not like that you have to purchase so many coins and things (which I refuse to do) I have to keep telling my daughter to keep playing and you'll unlock all the ponies! She loves and and so do I cause I get to do some errands and stuff while she is entertained by the MLPs
B000FIMG68|5.0|It was one of the best shows ever. Watching it over again is the best.<br />Season two is awesome. Loved meeting Desmond. Watching the tallies. Good times :)
B00555X8OA|5.0|At almost 500 reviews I'm not sure I can add anything material to either the praise or criticism of this work, but I thought I'd make a few comments of my own, and then, more importantly I hope, try to explain one of the main questions (which Kahneman doesn't get into as it's beyond the scope of cognitive research), which is why these two fast and slow systems came to be in the first place.<br /><br />Kahneman and Tversky's work on behavioral economics, like John Nash and Herb Simon before them, was ground breaking and established a new behavioral economics that would redefine how we looked at economic actors and economic activity. Prior to their work, as Kahneman says, economists had always assumed that people acted rationally. I had always found this assumption odd, as anyone with any clinical psychology or neuropsychology background (especially if one understands the limbic system and its many connections to the cerebral cortex) knows.  Although the human cerebral cortex excels in such abilities as abstract reasoning and analytical facility, in many ways our day to day behavior is still motivated and controlled by the more powerful and primitive paleo-mammalian brain or limbic system.<br /><br />This is especially true of structures like the now infamous amygdala whose baleful influence on aggressive, violent and even homicidal behavior has become well known even outside the halls of academe. In one brainwave study of death row inmates, for example, it was found that almost 40% showed excessive or abnormal activity emanating from the temporal lobes and amygdalar areas. When Charles Whitman climbed a tower at the University of Texas and killed and wounded dozens of people, an autopsy later revealed that he had a brain tumor that was putting pressure on his amygdala. Whitman (who had never been known by his friends and family to be aggressive or violent before) even realized  that there was something wrong with him and left a suicide note saying that they needed to examine his brain after he died.<br /><br />So for me, as a neurobiologist, Kahneman and Tversky's work just confirmed the fact that the behavioral economics worked pretty much the way every other aspect of motivated human behavior worked. Of course, as this book shows, they worked out the various cognitive factors in great detail in ways that still go far beyond our ability to link these behaviors directly to the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.<br /><br />I note some reviewers here have given the book poor reviews, saying the book contained too much of Kahneman's and Tversky's life story and the story of their relationship and didn't stick to the research. Worse, some have said that they found their results not particularly surprising and that much of it is fairly obvious. That might be true in the sense that to most intelligent people the average person might be more prone to mistakes of reasoning, logic, and just lack of simple common sense than a more intelligent person. However, I can tell you that from spending many years studying subjects such as logic, statistics, scientific method, and the philosophy of science that I still make errors myself despite having more background in these areas than most academics. Few people, even otherwise well-trained scientists, throughout their day routinely distinguish between all the different types of empirical information such as hearsay and anecdotal evidence, casual observation, speculation, weak vs. strong causality (i.e., deterministic as opposed to probabilistic), correlation vs. causation, quasi-experimental as opposed to rigorous experimental evidence, historical vs. non-historical, and cross-sectional as opposed to case evidence in fields other than the ones they're well trained in. My point is that even very intelligent people are probably more prone to these sorts of mistakes than even they realize and so Kahneman and Tversky's work is important in delineating what those limits are.<br /><br />There was one other issue I wanted to comment on, which Kahneman doesn't really get into in this work since as I said earlier behavior genetics and evolution are beyond the scope of cognitive studies, and that is why our brains are set up to work two different ways, with the fast system being so prone to so many problems and mistakes. I believe this can simply be explained by our evolution. As I learned in my very first sensory neurobiology class, over 20% of brain metabolism is devoted to the large area of the human brain just devoted to vision.  Humans (as are most predators like cats and dogs) are just very visual creatures.  Along the parietal, occipital, and temporal cortical borders, there are these fascinating neurons that receive inputs from all five major senses. Obviously these are multi-modal sensory association neurons whose job is to monitor information from all of our senses and to help generate the appropriate response. In many ways, humans function best as massively parallel multi-sensory associative information processing machines which even today the most powerful super computers still can't equal.<br /><br />Why all this capability has evolved, however, isn't that hard to figure out. If one of our primitive ancestors walking thru some dense primeval forest hears a twig snap, and fails to detect it or to appropriately act on it--then he could fail to make a kill, or worse--he could become some other predator's lunch. In the modern world we might not need such finely tuned hunting capabilities anymore  (although one could certainly argue that the modern urban environment presents just as many dangers) but millions of years of evolution has been honing these abilities to make fast judgements often based on seemingly insignificant or faint percepts such as a rustle in the bushes, a twig snapping, or other sounds that might signify either another predator or prey animal (or hostile human for that matter), could be nearby.<br /><br />I  believe this is the reason why the fast system came to be and why it works the way it does. Our fast acting sensory organs require an equally fast acting information processing and decision making ability for our very survival, and that's why humans still make these snap judgements and why we're often wrong. The important point, however, is that in the jungle we don't make any false negative judgements. False positives are okay since a danger should still be a danger until it's investigated and proven otherwise. But doing the opposite could be fatal. These evolutionary factors are also likely the reason why negative first impressions of other people are harder to modify and overcome than positive first impressions and why we are prone in so many other ways to make wrong decisions and judgements. Kahneman and Tversky's extensive research has elaborated in great detail how the fast and slow systems work. Now the next great task is for the neurobiologists and cognitive neuroscience experts to link these behaviors to their respective brain areas and eventually to individual neural circuits.ther issue I wanted to comment on, which Kahneman doesn't really get into in this work since as I said earlier behavior genetics and evolution are beyond the scope of cognitive studies, and that is why our brains are set up to work two different ways, with the fast system being so prone to so many problems and mistakes.

B000YJ85BI|4.0|This book was a fun, quick read. It it better than the second in the series.  The author seems to have found his stride in this universe without as much reminiscences of other stories as it felt in the first book.  It could likely stand alone, but I think I enjoyed it more for its continued storyline of evolving, known characters.  Don't expect characters to have nuanced depth, as it is the action and plot that drives the story.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|One of the most exciting, realistic spy movies.  Destined to become a true classic of Cold War style trade craft where the operator's end actions really do justify his means.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I always enjoy these books and the characters...but....it needs to come to a conclusion one way or another. The story lines are all basically the same (which is expected). So if there is to be more to this series.....give us the unexpected....ummmm....but don't kill him!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I'm 72 years old and very fond  off animation ART,so I can discern in the animation technics, I think in some future pleople will say, how a way can  this films done it, is incredible.<br />There is a scene where  a famele dog Peg act a bodeville like song in the kennel, animated by Eric Larson, in my own opinion one of the best scene animation ever done.<br />So all the film is a great achievemet.<br />Eduardo<br />Santiago<br />Chile
B001224WBS|4.0|Nice compilation of Depeche songs.  Price was right.  If looking for s true 'best of' album, this is the one to get.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game except I like the Rio version better. and I cant get it back help me please
B004S3MB2U|4.0|NeoCal Advanced Calculator was on  &#34;Free App of the Day&#34;. It is one of the most advanced calculators i have seen and well worth the full price for anyone needing an Advanced Calculator.
0316776963|3.0|This is my first enounter with the writing of David Sedaris, an American humourist it seems everyone else has known about for years. I like his style of humour and found the book to be light and entertaining. Some parts dragged a bit but these parts were redeemed by the sections that were truly hilarious eg. the chapter on his brother The Rooster. The writing is great, and although there is nothing ground-breaking here, it did give me quite a few chuckles. 3.5 stars
0385344333|5.0|If you want a good book, you should start to read Lee Child books.  My husband and I have read all his books and they keep you in suspense.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has definitely helped my wife and I make each other happier. A great and very entertaining read for anybody.
1451629184|4.0|It's an incredible story about a little girl who lost her childhood and longed for<br />her loving mother.  She later found out what her mother went through trying<br />to locate her.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Wherever this &#34;Cloud&#34; is it is an amazing part of the future.  I downloaded  all my pictures with great ease and still had some room leftover.  The real joy is to be able to access my photos for all my electronic devices.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had just read a couple of A.B. Guthrie's books, so I was initially disappointed the skill wasn't equivalent; however,  I didn't dare skim through \\"Gone Girl\\" by being satisfied reading the first sentence of each paragraph as I was while reading \\"Big Sky\\". I FELT I would've missed something crucial that would help in guessing what crazy event would happen next! It was fun to be on the edge of my seat without a clue as to what direction the author was taking me. I FELT captive until that last page was turned and then FELT lost once it was. And I have no idea why my kindle capitalized the word \\"FELT\\". Oops...did it again.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|i just loved this movie. it was really nice to see the relationship between these two. the movie true story was interesting to watch and also sad.
1439156816|5.0|A must-read for writers and aspiring writers, full of clear and helpful advice, as well as an interesting narrative on this writer's life.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I thought this app was a great use and it has very cool features. The best feature is that you can set it to wake you up with a fade in feature. Over all this app was very useful
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|First things first: This is not a straight rendition of Mansfield Park, my favorite of Austen's great novels.<br />Instead,it is a brilliant, creative amalgamation in which the priggish Fanny Price is turned into a lively hybrid - part Fanny Price (the preternaturally astute, but quite dull, judge of character) and part Jane Austen herself, as we know her from her letters. Austen was a sharp tongued genius, who loved only a few people, and thought well of even less - her words, not mine. She was an acute observer of people and had no illusions about human nature. Working on her \\"two inches of ivory\\" she created a panorama of personalities and had no compunctions about showing the seamy side of human nature.<br />Patricia Rozema, the writer/director, has produced a wonderful, lively script, and has a superb cast to carry it out.<br />If you want MP straight, this won't be your cup of tea. If you want a wonderful \\"re-imagining\\" of what a little Fanny Price mixed with a lot of Jane Austen might have been like, you'll enjoy it - a lot.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|this was a great movie. the way he flew that plane was awesome.hopefully this kind of thing doesn't happen. this movie was a movie to really watch denzel played a great part in this.
0345803485|1.0|Tedious and plodding, this book's popularity confuses me. Perhaps for those new to BDSM, there are titillating glimpses into another realm of sexuality and sexual expression, but the portrayals here are weak. Characters lack depth, writing is tedious and repetitive, it was really hard to read through to the end.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I really like the setting of this version of the story. I am a big fan of Arnold, so I wasn't prepared to like this one. What a surprise. Good watch.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars is the best game ever. The game is<br />awesome. I love it.  the best game for kids.
0141345659|4.0|This book is well written, it is positively sweet, funny, heartbreaking, and steers ordinary people to blow off any miniscule flaws that they have about themselves.<br />I only gave 4 stars bc I think the audience is more towards adolescents.  The characters are 16-17  y/o.  Also, the author uses words that people don't normally use in everyday language.  To me this upsets my reading, especially when I have to stop and think what does that mean?
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I and my wife simply loved the movie, and all it's humor, raw emotion, and pain. It takes the viewer on an incredible journey of the discovery of human spirit and how it transcends color, race gender and the bias and stigma's that hold us back from enjoying life.<br />The movie is a must see.
B0036UW09U|5.0|The music...the subject matter...the actors...it was a great movie. Kris was lucky to be in the same movie as Barbara! That final song she does I watch over and over again.
B004LROMQG|5.0|From the first season, Merlin has been a fun and campy type show.  That's why I love it.  Other Merlin shows are way too serious but because the character are played by younger actors, it's terrific.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|Another good album by the queen of pop! Somebody must have pissed her off cuz she is doing her thang! I liked all of her songs except for complicated but that 1 song did not bring this album down. Anyway, another good one from Ms. RiRi!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I absolutely love this show and become completely obsessed when I have it to watch.  I was a little disappointed toward the end of the season, with the tragic events that transpired to characters we love!  I am even concerned with the direction they seem to be taking with Edith.  I hope the fourth season does  not prove to be a disappointment!  I do love this series!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a fun and cool way to spend the day. It has awesome activities to do along the way. Try this game and you wont regret it.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Even though the plot is always similar, I love the back and forth between Castle and Beckett.  Esposito and Ryan are always good comedy relief.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Rihanna did her thang on this album! I love that all of the songs are good! I didn't any of them!..It was a great themed album. All of the songs match and it is overall a very good album!! One of my top 10!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|No words are necessary just buy it. Doesn't matter if you have already seen the movie, reading is a whole new experience
1616550414|4.0|Part of the book was dent when I open the box. Kind of still mad about it. I wish more games have this.
B0007O38XU|5.0|Not really for kids but the ribald humor of Mel Brooks is unsurpassed. Like Blazing Saddles this an outstanding romp on the genre.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Great game that includes a efficient combat system, and a interesting way to spend time when you are not fighting in a dungeon.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Not a bad song on the CD.  Closer to the Heart is one of my favorites.  Plus the free MP3 download just made it even better.  If you don't already own it, or your copy is worn slap out,like mine was, get a fresh new one!  I prefer to have a CD than just a download or to burn my own hard copy..  You never know when a fresh CD will come in handy...like when the charge goes out on your MP3 device!  Or when you really want to use it and really blast it loud and clear at a gathering or party.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have in fact seen all of the Bond movies ever made and yes, this is by far the best ever. Completely mind blowing.
B0060MYK7G|2.0|I was very disappointed. This is nothing like the Tudors- this is just another bad soap opera, albeit set in Renaissance Italy.  What a waste of history and all that delicious wickedness.  Everything feels phony and staged.  There is no cohesion between scenes or story lines.  Sure, they wear the costumes, but I don't buy Irons as Pope for a second.  The two Borgia sons, nobles by birth, act more like the rednecks from Deliverance than royalty.  They are supposed to be master schemers, but I don't think either could wipe himself clean.  And their hair is feathered and blown out so big that the men look like singers from an 80's metal hair band! (Twisted Sister does Rome.) I did not know they had blow dryers in the Middle Ages.  Hilarious!  Some of the actors speak normally, some with bad Italian accents and the star Jeremy Irons speaks like his mouth is stuffed with a wad of cotton and he's trying not to spit it out.  It's very unnatural.  The only redeeming feature is that the women are stunning.
B001VFTYW8|4.0|It goes without saying I really love all of the books I have read that Patricia Cornwell has written that I have read so far.
