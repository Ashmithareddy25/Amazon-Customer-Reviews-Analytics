B005ARYDYC|4.0|I guess there are just some movies that should be mandatory viewing and this is one of them. This has a lot of lessons to learn along with a young Kevin Bacon in one of his better roles. The blu-ray has extras such as interviews with the stars and some behind-the-scene &#34;i-did-not-know-that's&#34;. I could watch this over and over and never tire of watching this.
030789701X|4.0|It says it comes with a poster?? But my order did not come with one:( I really wanted the poster!! Other than that its well worth buying:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so fun  I can not stop playing it is a awesome game cool awesome fun cool  play it
B008JJM88Q|4.0|When I first found this app, I thought it was just a joke that there was a genie that reads your mind, but since there were good reviews on it, I'd thought I'd give it a shot. And it was worth having! He only got wrong once, and that's unbelievable! The rest he got correct! From fictional characters to YouTube stars, he could get just about anyone! A Must have!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the game I could play for forever! My 9 year old cousin is obsessed and so am I! Such an awesome game!!!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I chose this title b/c I liked the bit of romance between Percy and Annabeth. I also liked the way they had Luke host kronos In hos body. I also liked that we got a sneak peek at what he is like
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Awesome book. Full of suspense and kept me guessing all the way to the end. Love all of the Jack Reacher series. Did not want to put it down.
B00119ZMKW|4.0|But Jonas is a good replacement and the show is still entertaining.  It goes  off in later seasons without Jack and the Gould.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The writers have created an interesting and complex character in their Sherlock.  On the other hand, Watson's intelligence and ability are revealed gradually, making her perhaps more the heart of the program.  I wish I knew where the costuming department shops.  Both characters have great, laid-back style.
0857868764|5.0|The themes in this book concern the meaning of life and love, rationality and sentimentality, and reality and deception. With wit and charm, Haig provides a scathing description of all things human and the inherent redemptive quality in all those human failings - `Humans as a rule, don't like mad people unless they are good at painting, and only once they are dead'. Humans, it seems to a race of Vonnadorians living millions of light years away, have developed technology at a rate too fast for their psychology to handle. The last great quest in mathematics - the proof to the Riemann Hypothesis (that there is a pattern to prime numbers) was purportedly found by Professor Andrew Martin of Fitzwilliam College in Cambridge. That would be earth-shattering news for earthlings and Vonnadorians (for reasons not fully explained) because with that information, advancement in technology will be unlimited.<br /><br />The Vonnadorians sent one of its members to earth to kill (which he did) Andrew Martin and take his place, using the latter's form and identity to track down everyone else who might have information of Andrew Martin's discovery. In the course of which, another mathematics professor, Daniel Russell, was killed. The alien Andrew Martin then adopted Russell's dog, Newton, and carried on his impersonation, living Andrew Martin's life - with his wife Isobel, and teenage son, Gulliver. Being a Vonnadorian, and a member of a superior race, the alien Andrew Martin has superior powers and is motivated only by reason. Vonnadorians do not feel pain, have no emotion, and do not die.<br /><br />The unimaginable happened when the alien Andrew Martin, living as Isobel's husband and Gulliver's father soon transformed his alien self into something human. The process of his transformation provides one of the most fascinating insights anyone could have into what it means to be human. Could it be that only an alien can see how ridiculous it is for anyone to eat beef, not because thereis anything inherently objectionable in that, but in calling a cow beef when it is being eaten (\\"A cow is a cow even when you call it beef\\")? The Vonnadorian assessment of the human life is vividly expressed in the following passage:<br /><br /> \\"A human life is on average 80 Earth years or around 30,000 Earth days. Which means, they are born, they make some friends, eat a few meals, they get married, or they don't get married, have a child or two, or not, drink a few thousand glasses of wine, have sexual intercourse a few times, discover a lump somewhere, feel a bit of regret, wonder where all the time went, know they should have done it differently, realize that they would have done it the same, and then they die. Into the great black nothing. Out of space. Out of time. The most trivial of trivial zeroes. And that's it, the full caboodle. All confined to the same mediocre planet.\\" However, as the alien Andrew Martin was to discover, \\"at ground level\\" humans do not spend their lives in a catatonic state - they do things. Things like washing, gardening, driving, working, reading, gaming, jogging, quibbling, fantasizing, googling, hoping, striving, and sleeping.<br /><br /> The real Andrew Martin was a snob who did not like Australian wine, a philanderer who cheated on Isobel, and who neglected Gulliver, immersed only in his work and his monthly Tuesday trysts with his student, Maggie. But the alien Andrew Martin quickly but unwittingly learned what it meant to be a husband and a father. That change meant that he could not carry out his mission on Earth which included killing Isobel and Gulliver. Would the Vonnadorians permit that unilateral change of mission? A replacement killer alien was dispatched. How would the alien Andrew Martin react and protect Isobel and Gulliver - and his own life? A life which has now taught him to understand love even though he still did not understand marriage. The thrilling end should be left to the reader to enjoy by himself firsthand.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Rich scenery of the English countryside and a manor that actually exists, it's not a set in Hollywood! Sharp & witty dialog, romance, intrique...what more could you ask for in a show?  Love it!
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|More movement than in some of the other seasons and provides some more answers.  A little too much with the time jumps (contrived) and too much time spent on some of the characters without clear plot connections (maybe it's just me).  Somewhat hard to follow if you don't check in every couple of days (must be why several episodes are provided just to keep you up to speed).
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Enjoy Baldacci's new character and hope he gives us more of him. The pace was good and I was never bored. I'll be back for more.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I would recommend this as a great family series.  Thought provoking, comic relief, very good story line.  We can't wait to finish the series.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Enjoy most of Grisham's books; can read them quickly and always find something interesting in them. He has not lost his touch.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I could listen to Adele all day, every day -- she is phenomenal. This DVD/CD combo both looks and sounds amazing, and her between song banter with the audience is awesome. Buy this!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Better than American novels because of realism of everyday life balanced with spine-tingling suspense. You are inside the characters' heads at each twist and turn of the plot.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Love it! Just can't say enough about the actors/actresses, writers, props, AND Andrew Lloyd Weber's music is brilliant! It is the best rendition so far!
020530902X|5.0|Great resource for sorting out basic word use. I keep it next to me whenever I write. This is a book all writers should own.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|I had a feeling the album was going to by decent, but damn!!  These boys have outdone themselves!  Not only is this album excellent, but I think they've done some of their best work here.  Ozzy, Toni and Geezer are in their mid 60's, but have shown without a doubt that they are anything but old.  They still have what it takes to inspire generations of musicians.<br /><br />I had the album on repeat all day long, and it only grows better with each play.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|Have always been a StarBlazer fan. Remember watching it back in the 70's. Thought the movie was great, just did not care for the very ending. That is the reason it got a 4 from me.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|He jumped the shark on this one....two stars is a stretch.  The only positive about it was that I watched it free via Amazon Prime.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is very fun and now they have updated it. I know we've all have been waiting for it. Online, and buckets! They really outdid.it bringing new foods and items. Im amazed, i thought jeb would never update it. Most of us minecrafters are looking forward to future updates.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far I am liking this game.  Can not wait to let my granddaughter play with me this coming weekend.
B00499QUK2|5.0|The director, cinemetographers and writers are brilliant and the actors make the most of what they are given.  I have literally watched the shows at least two times and continue to find things to enjoy. It has also encouraged me to go back and read the series, partly to see how much they had to change to adapt it from the more genteel Victorian setting to modern times.<br /><br />This Sherlock seems to almost have an autistic personality and is far less pleasant than his literary inspiration.  At times, he is quite mean to other people in Scotland Yard and makes disparaging remarks about people's abilities.  However, he uses such wit in the process that you can't help but laugh.  Dr. Watson, to borrow from a reviewer on IMDB, has a much healthier and balanced consideration of Sherlock Holmes than his literary inspiration, who was almost fawning in his admiration for Holmes.  They make perfect foils in the series.<br /><br />I have watched the latest movie starring Robert Downey, Jr. and several episodes of &#34;Elementary&#34; and have to say that this is the best overall adaptation of the book series.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|This band is great. They rock hard and the music is really great. Maria has such a great voice. Her screaming isn't too harsh like some metal bands. I can actually understand what she is screaming. And the singing is beautiful and fits really well with the music. I just discovered this band and they have become one of my favorite bands ever. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves hard rock/metal.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book just as much a The Kite Runner. I did  initially find the different points of view and the multiple characters confusing, but in th end it all came together.Hosseini makes you feel with and for his characters, a rare feat in novelists today.<br />Can't wait fo the next book.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Love toy story 1 and 2. This was funny and entertaining and all kids regardless of age will enjoy it.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Sylvia Day's writing/story telling is fantastic and like it's predecessors this installment in the series is brilliant.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's journey continues from where 'Reflected In You' ended and we start to see their relationship find it's feet and their bond strengthen.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with this story, Gideon and Eva are both survivors of sexual abuse as children, and are still overcoming their demons while trying to sustain their relationship at the same time. Whilst this book does not contain the drama's of the previous two, it has tied up a few loose ends and has started a few new threads that should be interesting moving forward into the next book.<br /><br />You need to have read Bared To You and Reflected In You prior to Entwined With You to understand this book. Both of which are equally as fantastic and I highly recommend that you do so.
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|I didn't know anything about Aquaponics, but now I know everything thanks to this book. A bit overwhelming at times, but it all comes together in the last few chapters.
B00785P2QC|3.0|As my son suggested, SIMs would have been a better choice. I'm not sure why I downloaded this game. It's mostly about trucks and buildings...
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is an awesome game and fun but you can't light the tnt in creative that is the only problem I have run into
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have only begun reading this book.  I loved Hosseini's previous books and bought this one before finishing another book.  So far,this one is sure to spark many book club discussions on the true meaning of love, different types of love & what a person may be willing to do in the name of love. As with his other books, I can't wait to read more, yet I don't want it to end.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Few books have the power to spur the imagination in such a short span. Carl Sagans demon haunted world comes to mind, in that a combination of great story telling and love of science and nature can only produce. Thank you for this page turning and eye opening read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This update takes forever. It's ridiculously long and its a joke.But besides that the game is good. How long does it take Mojang to update a game.
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|Not that great. Android apps are not as good as apple or Windows. Um not sure how dev can fix they don't seem to have any Windows aps
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|If you enjoyed the Social Network soundtrack you will enjoy this CD.  This CD is like an evolution or an extension of the work done in Social Network and taken to a new, equally interesting place.  I suppose another way of thinking about it, I could imagine this album is the sound-track for another movie done by the same group of creative minds.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book prior to seeing the movie, but that's really not necessary.  The author is one of the screenwriters and so did a great job sticking to the plot.  It was well cast and very well acted.  Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as Katniss.  I can't wait for the sequels to come out!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|The book gives different viewpoints, some we would have never thought about.<br /><br />The characters are all interesting and have different outlooks on events.
B008D36INE|2.0|Rachel Weisz's acting ability is 'par excellance'!! This movie epitomizes this fact for me.<br />The character she portrayed was a clinically depressed woman who did the same things<br />over and over in regards to true love.  She was always left wanting and heartbroken.<br />I do not recommend !!
B0064MGU98|5.0|good writing, good acting,realistic plots, multiple interactions among interesting characters, not a soap opera. will be a classic for its time period.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I love stories where couples get married without really knowing who they married. Especially when they live happily ever after.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I bought this to show to my 7th grade class during the last days of school. Most had not seen it before and they loved it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini has a real knack for knowing how to look inside a woman's mind.  My favorite is still A Thousand Splendid Suns but this is well worth the read!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|its very fun and addictive. but the gems seem a tad expensive. multiplayer needs a better matching system.  great time killer.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I liked this book but to be honest I am upset that we have to wait for 2 more books to find out what happens to Gideon and Eva. This was supposed to be a trilogy and is now a 5 part series and not mention we had to wait 8 months instead of 2 for this book. I really hope Gideon and Eva get a HEA but at this point with all the drama they have to over come I am not convinced it will happen. I really feel like Sylvia let down her readers by pushing the release date back 6 months but she really screwed us by making this a 5 part series now. Very disappointed
B00AK57N00|4.0|This is one of those very simple game ideas but is still fairly fun. Good time waster, and will keep you occupied for a while.
B00479SVBU|1.0|Mine must have been defective considering all the good reviews on this thing. I would have attempted to get a refund or exchange except I hadn't tried to use it until about 2 months after I bought it. Lesson learned. Don't delay.<br /><br />Why is this item such crap? Let's just say that it nearly broke the electrical/cig lighter outlet on ALL three of my cars. Did not fit at all. That's a '93 Honda Accord, a '00 Mercedes Benz 320  AND an '05 Scion (Toyota) tC. THREE different makes of varying age and the stupid thing did not fit any of them. After the 3rd one the little fuse thing inside the plug actually popped out and went down the bottomless pit of the parking brake.<br /><br />Do yourself a HUGE favor and just go with the Monster Cable brand. It's half the price (if you're a smart shopper) and works great!
B004LPLU4K|4.0|A sweet story that is both magical and real on many levels. Some of the story's significance may be missed by children under 12 years old, but show it to them anyway. The magical quality will endear itself to them and they'll watch it again later for the more grown up understanding.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|This book was disappointing. I didn't even finish it because it was tedious. Nothing happened in the first half of the back except reading about the main character's mundane life with occasional flashbacks to his horrid childhood.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|I think this movie is genius on many levels, as well as it has so many relevant issues even today.  This movie show more than most movies a true representation of how life in Bootcamp as well as day to day life in the mi;litary.  This movie is an absolute classic and I suggest everyone watch it, since it shows plenty realities that confront our troops often.  Definitly a must see, imo....
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was a book club suggestion.  When I first began to read the book I was a little confused by the jump in time in chapter 2, however, once I began to read from chapter 2 on, I couldn't put it down.
B007IWG3WC|3.0|The premise is farfetched but most Sci-fi movies have that in common if nothing else.  There's some decent acting on he part of Thomas Jane, LL Cool J, as well as the supporting actors also o a great job.  If you enjoy sci-fiction as well as action in your movies, this will probably not disappoint.  Hope this review helps you decide.<br /><br />Sincerely, R.Perez
0446585041|2.0|I watch her show daily, and am mostly entertained and can see the humor in it. However this book is seriously nothing but fluff- I felt like she wrote the book just to make money off of the people who are loyal viewers who thought this would be alot better and would have stories of maybe what happened in her show. Some pages have half a page, some pages have items for kids to color, some pages practically repeat the same story and bash Harry Connick Jr, some pages are blank- which is how I felt after reading this.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Ended beautifully. I didn't think she could pull it off in a way that didn't annoy me but she did. Wonderful easy read!
B00740FMTS|4.0|Well written easy to read and a great story.  Though I read it about 1/2 though the first game, I would recommend not reading it till you at least play most if not all of the first game.
B002C949KE|4.0|The book is fun to read with a lot to learn. I guess many of his findings can be applied in many areas and probably more so in the retail business
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It is a good movie about the meaning of life and impressions rather than facts as the main message beyond how we interpret life and events.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book was fantastic...makes you think about life and death a bit differently and from another person's point of view. Lots for us to talk about at book club!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows from Sci-fi channel. The cast was great, the irony is hilarious and I just cannot get enough of the chemistry of the characters.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I picked up this book because I don't like Tom Cruse. A friend of mine was ticked that he played the title character in the movie, because Cruse is pretty much the opposite of Reacher. I was curious to know more.<br /><br />I should have skipped it. The plot twists are set up in a heavy-handed way from the start. The whole time I was hoping one of the characters would switch sides because it would have been unexpected and devastating. You'll get sick of reading how cars covered in chromium nose around the tarmac with pistols cocked and locked. Childs' attempts at description come off as redundant.<br /><br />Also, there's lots of telling us that the bad buys are bad, but not enough demonstration. I couldn't get behind Reacher and his decisions to take on the bad guys the way he did because he came off just as bad.<br /><br />In any case, it was an ok read, but I'm not going to continue the series.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game really entertaining . Great graphic for a free kindle game. I recommend this game for the great battle weapons and epic armour. Get it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not over the top challenging which is great. Was stuck a couple times but managed to figure the puzzles out. Very well done!
1592537251|5.0|The most valuable aspect of this book for me was the inclusion of how long it took to do various sketches. The various styles and locations are very inspiring.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great way to save web addresses, web pages, notes, and emails among various devices and platforms. I have several android devices and PCs between work and home. Just remember to synchronize the database when starting the program and when closing it.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|This is a beautiful, lush tribute to a legend...by a legend.  I am just delighted that Benson has returned to the studio to make more music for us.  My only complaint would be that Benson seems to be channeling Nat King Cole when I would have preferred hearing his own stellar voice singing these classic tune.
B003FFEX8C|2.0|I know that older the movie, the worse the effects are but these were very bad. You could visualize the wires.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! It was told very well and kept me intrigued the entire time. Now, I'm going to go rent the movie!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a fantastic show. The characters suck you in and before you know it, you've watched a whole season!
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|As in all his books the writing is superb.  Wonderful read.  Character development is perfect and the story depth offers the reader encouragement to take ones time reading yet wanting to reach the next chapter.  The story moves along at a great pace
B008I43DYU|5.0|Very nice app, not much to being a calculator as long as it get the job done. Changing themes is a great bonus well worth the price.
B004QSQML8|4.0|Tim Curry plays one hell of a devil and that's reason enough to buy this movie.  Fortunately it's actually a really good fantasy movie with a not-that-annoying Tom Cruise and a good story.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This was a great middle book, but i left me wanting more at the end. Martin had been good enough to give us exciting endings that led us to a hopeful future, but this book ended with no new excitement. In fact, Im a little annoyed with the Dany portions save her last two chapters.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Battery was the Canon BP511A not a generic version.  In Canon packaging as I was wanting. Was a bit pricey but I was willing to pay the difference to get the 'real deal' .  Came in in a timely manner.  I was pleased.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|It is a great book! Starts off slow, but once it gets going it pretty F'in cool! A must buy, you get TGWTDT whole series!
B000268QB2|5.0|I would listen to this whole cd over and over. it makes me feel 1) calm and 2) teary-eyed. for the sensitive poets like me, a good deal. &#60;3

B00886XQO0|5.0|As you know this is my second pair. I was so shocked when they cut the price down from $300 to $150. I've owned many turtle beaches in my gaming life and all of them can't compare to the Tangos. The presents are great; play in charge saves so much time. Overall, I'm very happy with this headset.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Originally I preordered from Google play..  My hubby got me a gift card and I thought what the heck I will just get it from there, no big deal right??  Apparently not...  Apparently it was such a big deal that no one including myself was able to get it along with all other books coming out that day... So I refunded and came to y'all... While I am not necessarily knocking Google, I am saying I now know not to preorder unless I do so through amazon.. Y'all saved my day..  And downloading was a breeze!!  And as for Mrs Day, she became my favorite from the moment I finished the first chapter of Bared to you.. I love the story, suspense and timeline in the books... I just hope and pray that I can wait a bit more for the next book..  My finger nails have just started growing back (lol).  And for all the others out there who complained about the ending, really ya need to get a grip...  So what it drops off and leaves us hanging..  Really don't cha think that life gives us happy endings at every turn??  Because I sure don't....  Sometimes it not about the cutsey happy endings but the suspense on whats gonna happen next.... In other words, not every string needs a knot!  Anyways, thank ya for taking a sec to read my review.. And will see ya one the next set of the Gideon/Eva wave!!  =)

B00AK57N00|5.0|One of the best games on the amazon Appstore, in my opinion. Some may say that it is repetitive, but the &quot;landing pad&quot; gets thinner as you advance, not to mention the different gravity strengths and wind speeds to increase the difficulty.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It is a book I read books I don't like having to be told how many words I have to write
0670024813|4.0|Jared Diamond has written a very comprehensive and thorough book in \\"The World Until Yesterday\\".  In it, he describes aspects of the cultures of different traditional societies and categorizes them into different sections, including treatment of the elderly, childrearing, religion, and health.  The book is hefty at over 450 pages, and it is not light reading by any means - however, it is chockful of interesting information.  If you want to know a lot of things about a lot of societies, then this book has it.<br /><br />So what's the problem?  It's in the way that Diamond arranges the book.  It is arranged by topic area, and each section starts with general descriptions of that topic area.  After that, and throughout the remainder of each chapter, Diamond provides various examples of how one or more individual traditional societies manages the issue at hand.  In doing so, he talks a great deal about some societies, and not very much about others.  Not surprisingly, given his affinity for New Guinea, there is a lot about the traditional societies on that island in this book.<br /><br />The result of all of this are somewhat choppy chapters which are very comprehensive but not terribly cohesive.  The book might have been easier to read if there had been sections on the individual societies, like the Inuit, but then it may have been difficult to compare the different societies' customs and traditions by topic.  So while I found the book difficult to read at times, I am not sure that Diamond could have arranged it much differently with the same content.<br /><br />Overall, the book has a lot of great information and is very interesting, if you can get past the way it is organized.  The content is very high level and not for the faint of heart.  The material is so detailed that I could see this book being used for a cultural anthropology course.<br /><br />One last comment - Diamond does not have a great reference section in this book, and in some of the chapters I wanted to see where he got some of his information.  He does have a section where he talks about his sources, but I would have preferred a simple bibliography so I could have looked up materials myself.to see where he got some of his information.

B00280LYHS|5.0|I think that this was a great book. It had twists and turns that I really liked. The heroes where very brave and its like they all knew that in the end the results of the war would be sad but would save the world.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is BY FAR the best program I have ever come across for sleep noise.  The combinations of sounds are mind-blowing, and the preset ones are excellent too!  I have put together a few for reading and sleeping, and I love them!  If you can only download one program for ambience sounds, this is the one.  I have uninstalled all others!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I Love these book could read them everyday. Now onto the the next book.  Hopefully this one is as good as this first two. Suggest these books to any adults.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is my first book by this author.  It will definitely not be my last.  It was riveting.  Now I must get to reading the next as there is no time to dither.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed the book from the start.  Could not put it down!  Although, I hoped for a more happier, fulfilling ending... Maybe it will come in the next book...

B00992CF6W|5.0|Cool app I really enjoy it.<br />It has many cool new things I hope more things are added, like use for the red stone.
B00992CF6W|3.0|this game is ok but it is hard I can't play multi player it's too hard to know what to do!!!0~0
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|The second book in the saga of the Honorverse by David Weber.  I reread them every year or so!  They hard to put down once you start reading them.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Its fun. Didnt give it a five cuz it has a tendency of freezing up on me.other than that its bingo fun
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Although the Intel video circuitry built into my ASUS P8Z77-V LE Plus is pretty good, this graphic card with its 2GB of RAM and GPU provides much more powerful graphic capability.  One can easily see improvement in game presentation and streaming video feeds.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I see that the game can be addicting...but fun as well..have progressed to level 7 rather quickly...some battles..some town building..and you are guided along the way.  Not bad.
B005PK57NU|5.0|What a wonderful series. Well written, with superb acting. Certainly one of the best series on television. I recommend it without hesitation.
0062082353|5.0|After learning of Chris' death I ordered the book, it arrived quickly & without any issues. In addition, every American should read how Chris became a hero.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This is a real cerebral murder mystery. We know who did it but the why and how lead Jude Law on a twisted journey of discovery. This movie was not what I thought it was going to be. It keeps you guessing right up to the end.
B000U6BT40|4.0|All the actors work well with each other and the store lines are interesting.  They should make a series with the talking house.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After what appears to be the beginning of a typical plot line, the story takes off with &#34;OMGs&#34; abounding.  A great read.  I definitely recommend.
B00AG297GK|3.0|Two legitimate chuckles during a 90-minute flick does not a good comedy make. Most of the jokes were either too obvious, repetitious, or slapsticky to be funny to me.
B003VS0CWO|4.0|US and UK versions (I couldn't notice the difference). Special features don't appear to work with the UK version, or it may be my Blu-Ray player is in need of updates. Interesting special features, but nested menus are a little annoying. If you are a Rocky Horror fan look forward to this 35th Anniversary edition with .... you know. If you are a RHPS &#34;virgin&#34; (haven't seen the movie in a theater), there are special feature that include live recordings of audience participation lines and other &#34;theater experience&#34; extras that may help understand why it is best experienced with an experienced audience and cast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game, is fair, unique, and fun. And its not boring like any other game because it changes its image every once in a while. This game is addicting and will get anyone playing it. I love this game and I showed it to my dad and he won't stop playing it! I'm 13 and hes 41. Obviously you need to get this game if you haven't already!
0399165274|2.0|Couple things I did while reading this novel, both of them not a good sign.  After the first 30 pages I placed the \\"book report\\" down (for that is how it read) and went online to see if Mr. Forsyth was still alive, the internet assured me he was.  The second thing I did was reread Day of the Jackal and I must report that if the same man wrote The Kill List I would be very surprised.  I haven't read any of his later books (The Afghan et al) so I really can't say for sure he is dead like Robert Ludlum who pumped out more books from the grave than while he was living, but if I was a betting man this is not the same author who penned on of my favorite books when I was a kid.<br /><br />Anyway, boring just not describe just how tedious this cliche of a spy thriller is.  From the names he uses, to the bland dialogue, to the characters out of a bad USA or TNT television made movie.  The arc of the story follows two men, the Preacher who's sermons are igniting terror attacks around the world and the Tracker (clever) the man assigned to kill him, oh and the Preacher somehow kills the Tracker's father.  Are you emotionally invested yet, I know gripping isn't it.  Gee I wonder how this book will turn out?<br /><br />There are some redeeming qualities that prevented me from giving it the one star rating as the pace of the book did pick up in the last fifty, but by that time you know the end and I can almost guarantee you won't care.  Save your money and time and find something better to read, or read this review and you basically read this book and a thousand others just like it.<br /><br />2 very generous stars.
0375703764|5.0|The book is in great shape. I haven't read it yet, but the format in which it is written looks very interesting. I also received it in a timely matter.
0761169253|5.0|Austin Kleon is a genius.  He has compiled into a 150 page book everything I have been studying about creativity for the past 20 years.<br /><br />Bravo.  This little book is a lot like Steven Pressfield's books, \\"Do the Work\\" and \\"The War of Art.\\"  They are similar because after I read both of those books I wanted to do my Art.  After I read this book, I wanted to so my Art!<br /><br />Why?  Because I got the truth, and the truth will immediately unblock you.  So, I was immediately unblocked.  Not many books on Creativity can do that, so this is the real deal.<br /><br />What I like about this book is:<br /><br />1) It is Simple.  And Simple is synonymous with Smart.<br /><br />2) I want to read it \\"out loud\\" to others.<br /><br />3) I want to buy numerous copies and give to ALL of my creative clients and friends. (Oh, I just did ..... I just NOW ordered 10 copies.)<br /><br />4) I can put on my desk or in my purse and refer it it.  A lot.<br /><br />5) It is fun.  And very funny.<br /><br />Thank you Austin.  You rocked it for me as an Artist and Musician.  You took a very deep and profound concept and made it simple, concise and doable.  That, in my opinion ...... is GENIUS!!<br /><br />So run.  Don't walk.  Buy this book.  Come on!  Trust me.  AND!!  Its $10.
0345529057|5.0|What a good deal for four of the five books of the series! Now they just need to hurry up and get the fifth book in paperback!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Took up so much memory on my Kindle Fire that it overwhelmed it, rendering it useless.  I deleted it immediately.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was very disappointed.  I loved his first two books.  This story was very difficult to follow...this included the time period and the characters.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A very inspiring inspiring book with a terrific message for all especially the young. Looking forward to sharing with my grandkids.a
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a must read.  It will evoke much disussion about euthanasia.  I saw this as a love story.  I love the title.....who was the &#34;me&#34; and who was the &#34;you&#34;....that is for you to decide.
B005LJITS0|5.0|My three year old son loved this movie and we enjoyed it as well! It had a good story and of course Ryan Reynolds was amazing!!!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|Loved this book. Very witty and thoughtful. Lots of mystery and suspense. Excellently structured. Plus opportunities for some laughs. Had a great ending which left me really excited about the next one. Definitely recommend.
0446580848|5.0|Nelson DeMille is an outstanding author.  Every book he writes is worth reading.  This book in particular is one of his best because every page contains a humorous quip.  I was amazed that he could write such funny asides so consistenly while still keeping the reader engrossed in mystery.  The book is filled with intrigue and tongue-in-cheek humor.  Very enjoyable.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Movie was terrible. Started off very predictable and the guy you want the woman to be with in the end reveals his love and gets nothing in return. She chooses the handsome cheating fiance over the reliable friend. All in all, very predictable script, and couldve ended a half hour earlier.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Much better then the movie! Great love story. The ending was shocking, makes me want to read the book over again!
B000005JA8|5.0|For those of you wondering why this is so expensive on Amazon, it's because the rights to the recording have reverted back to the Zappa Family Trust.  They've recently released a remastered version of TMR; it's available only from the Zappa website (aka Barfko-Swill).  Well worth checking out.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not bad, some parts were very bland and hard to keep me focused. Characters were relatable to real life. I
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I liked the story and all the sub-stories!  It is Stephen King &#34;show-off&#34; mode ;)  but it was engaging for me and I wasn't quite sure what was going to happen next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, wish the next one came out sooner! Definite page turner, never expected the ending! Loved it!
B00CBSYDSE|5.0|Another epic nature inspired journey through the wilderness from Scale The Summit! From Odyssey to The Traveler this is another adventurous effort from 4 of the best musicians around. Their strings are voices!
B009QW7HMC|1.0|Season 1 was exceptional, Season 2 gradually started slowing; seemed as if they hired more writers and they were paid by the word. Season 3 totally sucked. I ended up fast forwarding through about 80% of the entire season. Hours of nothing but wasted, meaningless words. It is as if the writing staff was quadrupled and each writer was trying to outdo the other. If this continues to Season 4; the series will indeed be the walking dead.
B004GYY714|5.0|There was a Seattle based radio show I used to listen to in NY that was taken off.  The only way I could listen was through TuneIn.  Like that I can listen to various channels whenever I want.
1881273377|5.0|Great priciples to apply to any marrage. Was able to give to other couples who are struggling with thier marrage.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I chose this rating because the lyrics and melodies of Rodriguez appeal to me viscerally. Being a child of the sixties and coming from a city in the northeast, it reminds me of the things I saw and heard growing up. Nostalgic is a good descriptor!!
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|The youngest member of the greatest band ever - Abba - Agnetha's newest solo album is her best yet after a long break - perfection on every track. I own hundreds of CD's, but it is EXTREMELY rare to find an album without a few (or a lot of) throwaway tracks. I enjoy every track on this album. Agnetha is always great, but this album is my favorite of hers. Well worth the wait.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I chose this rating because the lyrics and melodies of Rodriguez appeal to me viscerally. Being a child of the sixties and coming from a city in the northeast, it reminds me of the things I saw and heard growing up. Nostalgic is a good descriptor!!
B00932AA5G|5.0|Quirky off beat yes but thoroughly entertaining movie - subtitles not an issue. It takes a little time for the characters and plot to develop but worth being patient as it gets better and better with a great ending. it was my second rime viewing this film that I introduced to friends while visiting them.

B004JRVQX0|1.0|I just bought a brand new iLok 2 because it is required in order to use other software I already purchased. I set up an account on iLok.com and installed their iLok manager software as required. The software I purchased (Softube) shows up but won't run until I authorize it on my iLok 2. No problem, the iLok 2 is detected by the software.<br /><br />First attempt: The software stalls saying \\"Operation in progress\\". I give up after fifteen minutes of no progress.<br />Second attempt: Same story. Reboot. Try again. Same story.<br />Third through tenth attempts: Still failing. Open up a support ticket<br />Eleventh attempt: Oh wow, now it says I've successfully activated! But the software doesn't show my licenses on the iLok, and it still says they are available for activation. Try, try again.<br />Twelfth attempt: Successfully activated, but still not working. Reboot. Still not showing up as activated.<br />Thirteenth attempt through infinity: Well, you get the idea.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've liked QOTSA for a long time, but they've hit a whole new level with this one. Instant classic that speaks to so many other genres and trends but in a way that feels fresh and masterful. Feels like Bowie at his height: absolutely in control and very, very cool. More fun and more listenable than previous efforts. A great surprise.
143911000X|5.0|This book is funny, true, and cool. This book is worth every penny.Next purchase should be The Play Book, by Barney Stinson.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Can't help feeling JK Rowling needs to stick to her formula for writing for children which works so brilliantly. For me this just didn't come off. She has a tale to tell, but the telling is laboured and predictable. Not a literary masterpiece!
B007L24T52|4.0|He is a well-organized writer with well-thoughtout plots that sublety bring in the emotions of the reader.  Nothing he writes is marginal, all are good and some are great.  I am a big fan.

B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Anyone who has ever loved a dog will smile at this quick read.  The illustrations are really cute. Loved it.
B00C2U6G7C|1.0|When I heard that man of steel would have a complete new redone soundtrack I was a little hesitant. Growing up with the John Williams soundtrack still in my head to this day I was wondering why not keep some aspects like the main theme and do new stuff. But David S Goyer thought that with the help Hans Zimmer they could create a whole new theme. As much as I love Hans Zimmer and his work on the dark knight trilogy this fell way short of even that, let alone even coming close to the classic John Williams score. I mean I get it they waited to start over. But thought this whole soundtrack I was waiting and waiting for a theme. A new superman theme that when you hear it you know its superman. Sadly its not here at all. Most songs are very forgettable. Unlike the dark knight soundtrack that most tracks you relate with those movies these all seem generic. Nothing ear catching. From what I read about the movie as well this rebooting of Superman seems to be no so super.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It was a nice twist on all the other Zombie stuff out there.  Watched it with my teens and they loved it.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Acting is outstanding, story is moving and needs to be told over and over.  Based on a true story - does show goodness and how one person can make a real and lasting difference
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Not my favorite book. It is a little dull at parts but the movie should be much better.  I was more disappointed with the suposively love story.  maybe it will get better.
1781162646|5.0|HE IS AWESOME- GREAT PACKAGING-NO PROBLEMS. CAN'T WAIT TO START READING.<br />BRAND NEW BOOK- NO REGRETS. THANKS A LOT. GREAT PACKAGING
B000J103PC|5.0|The writing, dialogue and characters are fantastic. Ms. Streep is a national treasure is always worth watching and is perfection.<br />That is all...
B0067TQQI8|2.0|This was a great product to begin with.  I could get 2-3 charges for my iphone and my ipad.  After about six weeks it took about 2 days to get it to recharge its self.  Now it won't hold a charge and this is at the 8 weeks after purchase point.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The storyline is very familiar - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back - but it's told in a very amusing and engaging way. An easy read on a rainy day.
B005LAIH2M|1.0|Yesterday I had the opportunity to see the film. It looks like to be a good movie. I was wrong ...<br /><br />A Wired script which include Walking zombies witches, any kind of modern weapons you can imagine. The action secuence are ok, but it became to be boring due the poor script.<br /><br />The cast is expensive and atractive, but It seems to me thes famous actors are still regreting the moment when they acepted to join the movie.<br /><br />Personally the best of all of that for me is that I did not buy the movie..<br /><br />I rented at the video store near my house.<br /><br />A poor movie with very good actors.<br /><br />Rodrigo Toledo
1935597760|5.0|Although I finished reading this book about two weeks ago, I'm still haunted by parts of it, and I suspect I will be for a very long time. Centered around a man named Jamie McCloone, the novel tells of Jamie's earlier days in a Catholic orphanage in Ireland and how these years continue to affect him as an adult. While parts are the story are amusing, even funny, there's always an undercurrent of sadness. Poor Jamie. Will he ever find love? What about companionship and acceptance? And what about a dose of self-esteem?<br /><br />The book begins with a snapshot of the adult Jamie as he awakens to face another day of hard work among his animals. It's a lonely life, and the author soon mentions that Jamie's childhood was a brutal one that scarred him permanently. \\"Such were the effects of those seminal events that, over the years, had carved deep pathways into the lumpy geography of his brain, rendering him incapable of forgetting the injury that was done to him...forcing him to live a lesser life, full of empty dreams and broken hope, without much joy, without much meaning, without much love.\\"<br /><br />Jamie isn't the only lonely person in town. Lydia Devine, an unmarried school teacher who takes care of her elderly mother, needs an escort for an upcoming wedding. With the encouragement of a friend, Lydia soon places an ad in the newspaper announcing her interest in meeting a gentleman. With the encouragement of friends Paddy and Rose, Jamie too places an ad. Will these two 40ish people like each other? Things seem to be going along well until the unfortunate hair incident, but then Lydia's mother dies, and the situation (at least for Lydia) takes a back seat.<br /><br />The plot is wonderfully thought-out, the scenes are richly described, and the characters are well-developed. I especially like the way the author skillfully writes about the present and then surprises the reader with a dark passage on Jamie's past. The latter scenes were so brutal and harsh that I skimmed some of them. How can people defile, molest, starve, and brutalize little children to such an extent?<br /><br />I closed the book with a smile. And then I called my brother.immed some of them. How can people defile, molest, starve, and brutalize little children to such an extent?<br /><br />I closed the book with a smile. And then I called my brother.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm just beginning to use the app, but I really enjoy it. The graphics are great and it doesn't freeze up.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Not a family show due to MUCH gratuitous nudity. However, I gave it 5 stars because there were not 6. Awesome show, lots of well thought out plot lines, and they must have spent a fortune on it.
B00CWVM1AC|2.0|I was disappointed with the direction the movie took.  It was too maudlin and didn't give the viewer any greater insight to the main character than the first movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very very different book. I liked it very much but really had to think about it a lot after I finished to decide how I really felt about it.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|A classic in the true sense of the word! Big guy helps little guy! John Wayne is a true iconic movie star who plays a hero that has a hard shell but a honest heart!
B000U6BT40|5.0|This is Great Family entertainment.<br /> It is especially Great when watched on Amazon streamed video without commercial interruptions.<br />- I highly recommend this series
B005COO1X6|3.0|It's a good short story but a short story none the less.  I found the ending too pat.  Too deus ex machina.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The case is water proof as advertised BUT I had to take it off of my phone and will no longer use it after only having it for 2 weeks because I can no longer stand not being able to hear anyone that calls or even my ringer at all! Also, anyone who calls me has a very hard time hearing me as well. It is almost unbearable and I could never use my phone or hear anyone if I was not in a very very quite place. To me this case is definiatly not worth the trouble.
B00004VVND|5.0|Classic movie, and the quality is surprising good for a movie as old as it is.  I remember watching this movie with my dad when i was younger and as soon as i saw it available i knew i had to get it.<br /><br />Even back in the 70s they knew that machines would be the death of us.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|The characters though different in appearance continue to be recognizable.  The story lines are all very good, you have the murder, the motive, and a new way to view it all, then in pops the copycat. A reported you'd love to kill yourself, and the private life dramas of all the players.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Having never read the book or seen the original movie, i would have to say this remake movie is really good, its in my top 10 favorites.  I like the concept of having a child vampire, its an angle that is not normally considered in vampire movies.
B00C68JXAW|5.0|Enjoyed the movie in BLU RAY -the sound and picture are a big improvement on the DVD.Delivery was prompt,and the movie arrived in perfect condition.Best Regards .AG
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Great series, glad to add this to my collection, especially on blu-ray.  Recommended for anyone who loves the series.  Great price.
006054094X|4.0|I've heard a lot of criticism of this book, but it is a fascinating read. People nick-pick about details and some of the author's inductive reasoning. However, 1421 is written from a sailor's perspective, not an academic's. Reading this book, I couldn't help but wonder what would be left of America's history in 600 years. Will people be living in thatched huts and scoffing at the \\"fairy tales\\" about Americans walking on the moon?
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Love this collection, especially since its on blu-ray, the action sequences are amazing way better then on VHS when i first saw these movies.<br /><br />The specially features are pretty good too, nice addition to the collection.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Added several games to my kindle fire for the kids to stay busy on a long road trip.  This game is currently my boy's favorite.  Nicely done.
B0032CVAQQ|1.0|Hope this book helps someone. Clearly not meant for us. Starts out with a chauvinistic slant and goes from there. Overall message: Women be better more obedient wives, Men you really might pay more attention.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was a great read, the characters are very well developed and this fantasy world feels so real.  I read this as well as listened via audible.com, it works great with Amazon's Whisper sync.
B005AUWY90|3.0|One thing I always appreciated about Pixar was their ability to tell a story for kids and adults alike.  Cars 2 is the exception.  My granddaughter (3 years old) is obsessed with Cars, the movie, and I bought this sequel for her.  We watched it together,but I'm sure I enjoyed it more.  It is well done, but darker, more sinister and  has a story that is more convoluted than a typical Pixar movie. I guess that's why it went direct to DVD.  If you have someone older to watch it, they may enjoy it more than a younger child.
B001HDWKMA|4.0|My favorite album of his is still \\"God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise,\\" but this is still a very solid album. Right up there with \\"Trouble\\" for my taste. He just keeps getting better with every album.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Love this movie, can not see it enough times. Love the music and dancing. Patrick is such a great actor.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I have been really enjoying the Outlander series, but this one was by far the best one yet.  it is fast paced and leaves you on the edge throughout the book.  it has a little bit of everything in it.  While I have always felt that all the books are good, this one is Great!.  If you have read all the books coming up to this one, you will really like this one.
B004T5R2HQ|3.0|I completely love this app. I do not purchase apps at all because I find none of them necessary, but this one I would happily pay for. It is the only app I find actually useful.  Unfortunately it doesn't always work.  Right now it is not working for me.  It takes the picture, trims it, but when it's done trimming it it goes back to the main screen.  I've got the app on 3 other phones and it is doing the same thing.  It doesn't need updated, I have uninstalled and reinstalled it, nothing. I even purchased the license to see if it was a problem that way, nothing.  I contacted the developer, no response. I just got off chat with Amazon and they refunded my purchase. I went on and found \\"Handy Scanner\\" and it works the same, if not a bit nicer, than cam scanner, so I'd recommend that one also.  I'm giving cam scanner 3 stars because it's just not working. However, it is a free app.  If you get it and it's working for you, great! It's the best thing to have.  No more writing down recipes out of magazines or ripping out pictures to save for later. It's all nicely stored in your phone or sent to your computer and super easy to use.  If you have this app and it's not working, try Handy Scanner. It works the same, just as easy to use, and currently it's WORKING. =)
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Trekkie or not, this is an epic movie!  I usually don't see movies multiple times, but I'll watc this with the kids every time.
B000H7J9QM|4.0|Turn your brain off, rev your engines and make some popcorn.  Not a great story but a fun watch!  Give it a shot!
B003UESJEM|5.0|Great story, wonderful script, amazing performances from some of the best actors making films today.  Don't understand why it didn't do better in theaters.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I play on my Ipod and kindle fire.  on my ipod I got the latest update and I always build big buildings so I ask my brother to help me with the walls and flooring.  but my kindlefire still hasn't gotten the latest update so he cant join the game because it says that I have the outdated version. so ya gonna have to do the flooring. and wall by myself.  :(
B001KT6JPA|1.0|Story is poorly conceived and acting is fair at best except for Hopkins who is always good. Class B flick
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Excellent, excellent, game and I might add a great app for the kindle fire hd.  There's no way to explain why I liked this game.  Keep up the good work.
B0046W5E0Y|4.0|if my nice love it, i will love it too so that all that matters. it a week story but the animation is good and the voice work is done right. [[ASIN:B0060CX43M Tinker Bell]]
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I really like decorating the fish tanks. I would keep playing until I had enough points to by the really expensive stuff. I also like when the fish told me what to buy.
B004W1GCNC|2.0|Perhas it was unfair to watch this so close to the Downtown Abbey Season.<br />this series was less &#34;believable: as historically real.
B005R32L66|1.0|I have uninstalled skype from my computers and tablet.  They are invasive and are constantly changing their software.  I have found some earlier versions that work great and do not constantly try to run in the background, but no matter what I do, updates override the version I am happy with.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A good show with witty dialogue. This show follows the same general outline of others. Stubborn protagonist, empathetic unlikely friend, stern boss... yadda, yadda. But I find the subtle humor to be really refreshing. Gabriel Macht is great as Harvey.
193700788X|2.0|While I admit the last several books have failed to live up to expectations, this was an insulting finale to what had been a great series. Harris had repeatedly said that Sookie wouldn't have a happily ever after... Go figure she'd give into pressure. The writing was insulting to say the least.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is fun and EASY to play. Looks like the cartoon, even sounds like it. If you like my little pony this is the game to play.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|Description said it works for iphone and other cell phones but it doesnt fit my cell phone (Samsung Galaxy 3). Very dissapointed!
B0044C5SCU|4.0|While this season isn't one of my favorites the series has had it is still good.  It just seems to drag a little bit to me and I find myself losing interest from time to time.  Still...it's a great show and season 4 seems to be picking back up ;)
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|These are the coolest movies. I am going to the theater on Friday to see the third in the series. So much fun.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Samsung Galaxy Note.  A lot of fun and the graphics are great.  I recommend this app as a great way to spend time.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|This film is up with the likes of &#34;The Uninvited&#34; (1941) and &#34;The Innocents&#34; (1963), as far as being a classic, slow-hand-on-the-shoulder ghost story.  None of the blam!-out-of-the-blue crap like you see in Hollywood films, this is beautiful, dark, foreboding, and in the theater I giggled with delight as the audience reacted to it, even applauding at the end.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I was surprised I had not giving this series a view before.  I really enjoy the action, and story lines.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|the story line is a complete pile of crap but the pq was very good over all is an ok movie after all
B0019GO58C|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT STORY. SAW IT MANY YEARS AGO AND WANTED TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION. SHIPPING WAS FAST AND SECURE. THANK YOU, PATRICIA
0345525558|5.0|What a pleasure to find a writer, who can use language so beautifully and has some fresh ideas to offer. The protagonist is both compelling and repelling, but always completely believable. The story kept up a good pace. I wanted to keep reading and was quite moved by all the characters, their eccentricities and human foibles. More like this please!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter LOVES this app! Great for something to keep her occupied on long car trips. For a free app, it's really well constructed.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I LOVE this game it's fun and exiting G5 games are the best games ever EVER you should get all of their games
B002N44XSG|5.0|Awesome book. I really recommend this book. The short stories are great. If you like Rick Riordan's books,you will love this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game challenges your mind. Giving you clues that could help you escape. I'm personally addicted to this games. The clues are so difficult but gun to figure out the the number of animals equal a code. Or random boxes equal a patter you need.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'd give it 5 stars because it works good. No loading longer no overloads and I recommend this app to people who enjoy  fb.

B003XE3G9M|4.0|These shoes were way too small and I ordered the same size as previous Crocs.<br />Cute shoes though. They were made in Mexico, not China as advertised.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|The war that none of the politicians cared about.  Soldiers know when those who are in control don't care.  A look back.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|Loved it!!!  And, totally worth the price. Thank goodness for Amazon.com when we are looking for a favorite movie that cannot be found in any store.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|Fast, Runs cool. I use for everyday computing and moderate gaming. Have not tried to overclock, so I can't comment on that.
6305428042|5.0|We did an entire Halloween Party based on these characters....What a Blast!<br />They need to make more movies like this.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is definately a \\"must read \\"book although I liked his first two books better. Dr. Hosseini cleverly wove the lives of his characters together, making the book varied and interesting reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is the best app ever I love it if u like action and r bored off.the usual get this and you'll never get bored GET IT NOW
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|My wife and daughter were talking about this series and apparently it is supposed to be popular amongst the younger crowd.  I enjoyed Harry Potter, another series geared toward tween-to-teens, so I thought I'd give this one a spin.<br /><br />It is well worth the read and I'll be reading the entire series.<br /><br />The way the author combines known legend, lore, and history with a touch of modern flair is fantastic.  It's good to see the art being practiced so well.<br /><br />And who knows...perhaps Nicola and Perenelle are still alive, brewing their potion after so many centuries, and they'll even enjoy this novel....
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I chose this book after reading the sample and became invested in the characters almost right away.  It was uplifting and sad at the same time with an end result that was predictable but surprising as well.  I finished it in no time at all which, for me, is quite unusual.  It was a different type of story and held my interest.  I am a mature reader but I feel it will appeal to young and old alike.
0764197843|4.0|Practice exams are very similar to the real exam, so whatever you score on the practice exams you will surelly score on the real exam.<br />I don't rate this book with five stars because I also had some problems with the audio CDs.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Thank you Slyvia Day for wasting my time thinking this would be the end to a good series instead your being money hungry and dragging on what used to be a good story! No spoiler alert here just don't even bother same drama as first two books with RIDICULOUS amount of fluff!! Horrible ending waste of a read. Returned the book and got my money back!
B008133MDK|5.0|Kept me involved the whole time.  The Characters are great. There were many surprising twists and turns along the way.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This show has been on TV for a some time and I had never viewed it until now. Man was I surprised to find that it is an outstanding show and I am up ti Season 3 now.

B006MGB31Q|4.0|The set doesn't come with a bunch of extras, but these classic movies look great on Blu Ray!  A great set for an Aliens fan.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|it took a little time to get to my house. but after i got it worked good then the spring broke. it still worked just not as good<br /><br />BTW: make sure that your phone is an iphone or the same size because the iphone has a hard time fitting
B00A8ECU24|5.0|neat little game. if your a brony or pegasister u will enjoy this game. and with a free price tag how can u go wrong?
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a good free app that lets you see in a very easy format where you stand with your battery.
B0026Q8EWW|3.0|As a lawyer, I found the movie entertaining, but frustrating at the same time because the courtroom scenes were ridiculous.  Closing arguments were the worst.  Just about the entire content of Rudy's closing should have been objected to and a mistrial declared.  Ridiculous.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|This is a great cd for BVB fans & will make this awesome band some new ones. All 19 songs are great!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read this book with great anticipation  and found it fell short. I find the book superficial in the way he chose the characters and how he than described them. While I found &#34;  A thousand yellow suns &#34; a great book with much insight<br />On the lives and tragedy of the two women,  I ask myself &#34; What did the mountains echo?<br />No, I do not recommend this book.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I've heard all of the complaints about Bill Ward not being there.  I've also heard a couple of different &#34;sides&#34; to the story.  Who knows what is true and what isn't.  The one that really stuck was Oz saying that Bill had a bunch of post-its on his drum set as &#34;cues&#34;  now even back in 1999 I read that Vinnie Appice was backstage warming up with para-diddles in case Bill took the big header...don't know if that's true either.  But it  does make one question his health and how it would of course affect his ability to play.  Enough of that.  I love this album, I feel it's truly great.  it does borrow from some past Sabbath classics...but isn't that the Sabbath we love?? &#34;Damaged Soul&#34; is my current fave...The whole album is a &#34;Slab of Pure Sab&#34; in my book!
1623420148|5.0|I loved this book. Drew is so realistic, he sounds like my brothers. I still not quite certain the author isnt a guy writing under a female pen name.:) funny a strong female funny wait did i mention funny.<br /><br />Arc for honest review
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Great story line, and the twists kept me wondering, although I had a good idea. Great actors who did a great job.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|These books only get better. I just hope it doesn't take a long for the next one to come out. I almost had forgot the 2 before.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|It seems to have some trouble in guessing some famous people it should know. For instance, it asked about 15 questions that I answered properly, but instead of answering Ringo Starr it came back with Pete Best (OK, he was also a Beatle but how could it miss Ringo)?  It took finally about 60 questions to get it back on track to guess Ringo. Sometimes when I answer with the proper gender it will go in another direction by asking questions pertaining to the opposite gender... what???  This is limited to guessing people, which can be boring. I suggest for more fun, to get the little hand-held electronc ball called Q20 that includes everthing, and starts by asking if your item is animal, vegetable or mineral. This Akinator is a fun diversion, but limited in scope. It is amazing, though, that it can \\"read your mind\\".
B005FLX1HS|3.0|I really loved the Scary Monster cd, so I was excited to buy Bangarang. Maybe I'm still getting used to it, but it's just not as good as Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.
B004K58GSO|5.0|I love old westerns, and this is one of my favorites. Seeing it in hd just puts it over the top.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Finally!! Please Fallen Tree make more games like this it's great, the graphics are mind blowing please don't take this long to make another Quell version.
0307476464|4.0|I was handed the single volume binding of this trilogy by a friend and delved into it with curiosity as I had never read anything from Haruki Murakami. The ability of the author is plain to see; even if he indulges in a bit of narcissistic lecturing on what it takes to be an author, I feel he's earned the right to comment given his technical skills at authorship. There is somewhat of an authorial soliloquy around page 178 where he has Tengo utter phrases like: \\"The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a single problem into another form.\\"<br />The story is curious, idiosyncratic, dystopian, fantastical, overtly sexualised - all this and more over the course of some 900 pages. It was a book that commanded my time in a comfy chair over a few hours. It was a book that grabbed attention, slowly built characters and linked them together through coincidence and Fate yet...by the final few pages I put it down disappointed at the abruptness, the multitude of loose ends, the explanations that failed to come. Murakami hinted this would happen with his tiny excerpts from Air Chrysalis which also just...stops. Despite trying to encourage the reader to focus on the unfired gun of Chekhov's insistence, I found I sidestepped such a clumsy ploy, sat on top of the slide in the playground, stared at two moons and couldn't help thinking every time I put the book down...\\"Isn't this just 'The Borrowers' evil cousins at work?\\"<br />Of course, the nature of a fantastical dystopian novel is to perplex, confuse and beguile. We're not really meant to be led, rather encouraged to empathise, to seek our own 'voices' in the Little People; to try and relate to the introverted, self-centered characters that litter the text. The only thing that separates them in their little bubbles is the occasional dysfunctional motive when they try to engage in emotion.<br />For me, a stand out novel is littered with sentences you want to quote to people; of crafted words that resonate with personal beliefs, fears, thoughts. IQ84 is such a novel. Here are some examples that stood out for me, starting with a sense the poesy inside Murakami's prose:<br />\\"Hundreds of butterflies flitted in and out of sight like short-lived punctuation marks in a stream of consciousness without beginning or end.\\"<br />His sense of cynical humour:<br />\\"Constipation was one of the things she hated most in the world, on par with despicable men who commit domestic violence and narrow-minded religious fundamentalists.\\"<br />We see more philosophical views:<br />\\"'Without a doubt you have done the right thing. But your act must not go uncompensated. Do you understand why?'<br />'No, not really,' Aomame replied honestly.<br />'Because you are neither an angel nor a god'\\"<br />Murakami voices his distaste with extremely dogmatic views:<br />\\"'Any religion that would prohibit life-saving surgery simply because it goes against the literal word of the Bible can be nothing more than a cult. This is an abuse of dogma that crosses the line.'\\" or \\"'there is always just a thin line separating deep faith from intolerance.' Ushikawa said.\\"<br />and lastly a poignant statement that will resonate with many: \\"His daughters might forget all about him, but that blood would not lose its way. Blood had a frightening long memory.\\"<br />Of course, there are hundreds more; there are long paragraphs where characters reflect on matters that are personal to them. Whether we agree with those or not is not the point; it is the understanding that Murakami draws us to opine in the silence of watching his words on a page and makes us pause from his narrative for some time before moving on.<br />I don't intend to speak of what the novel is about because, for me, the book has not prompted me to review it in that way. Rather, the stories of Amomame and Tengo set against the fantastical of the world of IQ84 and those who revolve around them are expertly drawn, always interesting, faintly plausible.<br />At times the book is shocking in its sexual brutality and violence given life in Aomame, at others breathlessly poignant in Tengo's elegance; yet, for all that this is a novel that left me slightly dis-satisfied. It satiated my craving as I flicked through the pages, left me not particularly wanting more as Aomame and Tengo climbed back up the ladder to the Expressway. I would encourage people to read it, which might be slightly odd as I believe you will put it aside with a sense of losing a moon, but there is no denying the beauty of the prose, the deft handling of the characters, the futility of their motives.s the book is shocking in its sexual brutality and violence given life in Aomame, at others breathlessly poignant in Tengo's elegance; yet, for all that this is a novel that left me slightly dis-satisfied.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book skipped around ,it was a while before I learned who Markos was. Too many characters were left undeveloped,hanging ,left me with&#34;what happened with that one?&#34;.I hate that! It would have been a great read!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I cannot believe that she ended the series in such a manner that was so disappointing. I feel that she left so many things still up in the air.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first book.  Saw a drop off in the second book in terms of story and interest. This third book is just boring.  Is Sylvia Day just trying to make as much money as possible by having this series continue?  Entwined to you is just a book of sex scenes.  Every time there is an attempt at a story line it is halted. There is no reason why this book did not finish the story of Gideon and Eva.  Could not believe that it just ended, and that another book is coming out.  Back to the sex scenes, they are so frequent and explicit without any build up. As such, they lack the titillation to make them erotic.  At points, I just skimmed through them.  Enough with all the sequels. Authors are losing their credibility.  A great story like Bared to You becomes an attempt to just cash in in Entwined in You.
B003OUXECE|5.0|M journey to discovering this book started when I first started seeing adverts for a videogame called Bioshock Infinity earlier this year. I bought the game used and when it arrived, noticed it came with the original Bioshock game as well. I played the first Bioshock and was shocked by the surprise ending when I beat the game. I bought Bioshock 2 to continue the series as the Infinity game is a completely different take on the series and is not related to Bioshock 1 and 2. Then one day while perusing through Amazon, I came upon the Bioshock book by John Shirley. I quickly put down the game controller and picked up this book. John Shirley brought the story and characters to life in such a way, that you will think that he created the entire world of Bioshock. He fills in the gaps and tells the story that the video games in the series fail to tell in the midst of melee attacks and audio-phonic recordings in it's RPG world. If nothing else, read it for the awesome sci-fi fiction that it is. You don't need to know that this is a video game.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Interesting take on the traditional Star Trek formula.  Episodes are not predictable and hold your interest.  Special effects are alright but nothing spectacular.  Primarily, I find this series entertaining based on the interaction of the actors rather than getting caught up in any special effects.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I read this one within a few hours and found it very entertaining. The authors involved really know how to spin an original storyline.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great show. I would recommend this show to anyone. Too bad they only did one season. The movie doesn't answer enough questions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the calculator . I only wish it had more color . Other than that it is perfect and does everything a calculator should do.
B00BGIC170|5.0|This is a really funny and honest movie. If you don't laugh at it then you need to grow a sense of humor! Apatow does what he does, he's the best, and Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are hilarious as usual. This is kind of an extension of Knocked Up, with a focus on the life of the two supporting actors of the film. Also, Apatow and Mann's kids are adorable and really funny.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome but just one thing that I do not like about this game you can't walk,! But I still love this game
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Mostly pretty banal humor.  Probably very funny for a thirteen year old, No where near as good or original as Borat,
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Be Good was an Excellent purchase.  I would buy Anything Gregory Porter makes. I will be following him so I can catch a live performance
B0016OMFNY|5.0|In years gone buy, I owned this CD on cassette tape.  It was always one of my favorites and I was happy to find it again.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started reading these books because I love the HBO series so much.  The books are very good and cover a lot more detail than the HBO series.  Even though I knew what was going to happen next, the books were well worth the read.  I'm excited for the get to the next few in this series.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris is a true American hero and a good person you really get to know him. He tells the his story like it is and no holding anything back.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. I love a book that elicits an emotion, and this book definitely did. I hope that others enjoy it as I did.
B00CFQMVLS|2.0|This is beyound the doubt the worst in the DIE HARD franchise.  Nothing like the previous.  The son concept must of been developed to transistion to a younger star.  Even the chase scenes became monotnous after a while.  By the way, does Moscow have any police?  You can just blow up 200 cars and no one even wonders what is going on?  Ridiculous.
B007EQGTX0|5.0|A friend lent me this on CD. After the first track I was online looking for the vinyl copy. Katie's music is custom made for vinyl, just absolutely beautiful vocals and instrumentation. I like every track on this album, plus you can take it with you in the car (as it comes with a free cd version). Buy everything of Katie's , she is magical.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|One of the best games  I have played lately and I am not into playing app games on my Kindle or Droid because I use them for professional things. BUT this one is worth being on my devices.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Excellent, heartwarming movie. Very family friendly.  Better for children over 8 only because they may better understand.  I easily let my 6 year old watch, however I had to explain more.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Kept hearing about Angry Birds so I bough a copy.  Spent a couple of hours playing it last night.  Great fun.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Game was very interesting the only thing I had trouble with was findind the hidden  objects sometimes they are in very dark places. I do like the use of thd hint button with no penalty.  I would recommend this game.
B00000G3I2|5.0|This pre-Thirty Something movie and soundtrack hosts a cast of beloved actors from the earlier parts of their careers telling a moving story about a reunion of sorts at a friends funeral. The music is so great!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it all the time it's really addicting but in a good way. Great for kids. The message of vandalism in the beginning is not the best but most kids wouldn't even get that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been waiting for this update to come out on my tablet it was worth the wait even though the update came out on my ipod befor my tablet it was worth it
B002N44XSG|5.0|This is a really interesting book and it really shows what happens in camp between the books. I really love it because it just cracks me up. Great is the only word to describe it.
B0092SQ5EG|1.0|another narcissistic celebrity tell-all! Does anyone really care? This is what America's Got Talent ends up being? Over-indulged and over-exposed!!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the best thing to play with the kindle fire HD because angry birds has never had lightsabers before now :)
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Seems to be the most powerful lighter adapter on the market. I use this to keep my tablet & Bluetooth GPS charged up in my aircraft... which puts out 28.5 volts... If you want full charging speed to an android device on the apple port...pair this with a &#34;Red Band&#34; USB charging cable. Works great!
B00003BDXG|5.0|I had specifically asked for non-directors cut 'cos I like that version better. having said that, timely delivery and great quality. Would do business with again. Thank you. A+
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to use. Makes for great entertainment. Glad they added more vehicles and courses. Please add more - maybe a boat and a jet ski
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Did not ask for blu-ray. Specifically avoided it. haven't played yet since don't have blu-ray. delivery was fast and I'm sure it is great. Would carefully do business with again.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very well told movie.  Ben Affleck really showed the world what it was like to be in the middle of a political battle.  The truth being told about the bravery of the common folks who had their fates tested every day and the alliance of Canada to support the U.S.  I recommend everyone see this movie and appreciate where you are.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game to get on any device especially the kindle fire I have this game on every device and it is all ways good<br /><br />This game is the best game to get on any device especially the kindle. If you get this game you will not regret that $7.00

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|great acting, little slow at some points, but still never felt like it was dragging. Very entertaining flick. Would definitely recommend
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This app is lame do not get it<br />Because I put a alarm it didn't work and I was late for work and got fired once again don't get it
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|this was a good and sometimes challenging game but the bonus part seems extremely lame to me. Wish there was a follow up
B00BMTX2QM|4.0|I'll admit to starting to like Cathedral a little late in the game considering I remember hearing \\"Ride\\" back in 1993 and brushing it off. At the time, compared to other metal acts like Sepultura, Napalm Death, Carcass and Morbid Angel, Cathedral seemed slow and oddly retro. Which, in its own way sums up what most people need to know about Cathedral: They don't care about trends and what other bands are doing, they are doing to do what they want to do. That philosophy is demonstrated on The Last Spire, which according to the band, will be their last album as Cathedral. Things like that tend to change, but for now I'll take them at their word.<br />Through out their 20 year career and 10 full length studio albums, Cathedral as shown an amazing amount of flexibility, finding ways to blend slow as molasses doom metal with progressive and 70 retro elements. Some of their CDs are more straight ahead metal (Ethereal Mirror, Garden of Unearthly Delights) while others (Guessing Game, Supernatural Birth Machine) explore some pretty far afield musical ideas. Spire combines elements from all of their albums so as to be a almost a recap of everything they've done, although I think the doom elements outweigh the progressive elements.<br />The doom elements are things like long, around 7 minutes on average, sludgy songs that are about decay, death and all the things you'd expect lyrically. The progressive elements show up in some very abrupt time changes, retro elements like xylophone interludes, and melodies that somehow remind me of the Beatles. As other reviewers have mentioned the first track is appropriate, but a complete waste of time. Its filler that goes on just a little too long. The first single, Tower of Silence, contains what I believe to be a good-bye to their fans as Lee Dorian growls about the wheels of time stopping and the Tower of Silence calling him. One thing I noticed is that this album doesn't have a single song about witches on it, which I think is rare forthem.<br />Production wise Spire is top notch. Gaz Jennings guitar work is thick and sick as usual, Brian Dixon's drumming is a little withdrawn because of the slower tempo of the CD, and new bassist Scott Carlson sounds good although he lacks some of Leo Smee's style. Some people have never liked Lee's voice, and that won't change with this CD. Personally I think his performances usually match the tone of the songs well.<br />Where this album falls short for me is that some of the songs are too long and a little random, almost to the point of being meandering. Some of the songs could have been broken into 2 that would have been more cohesive. This is also their slowest, \\"doomiest\\" CD since Forest of Equilibrium, which fans of Sleep or Electric Wizard will enjoy, but my death metal inclinations make me prefer faster beats.<br />Cathedral has gotten this far by doing whatever they hell they wanted, doing it for themselves and their fans, which is a brave decision in this world of music charts, focus groups and careful marketing. They never reached some of the high platitudes of their peers, sacrificing income opportunities for musical integrity. My hat's off to you gentlemen.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Because this CD is their last by choice, the band has made a statement about their musical journey that says \\"In case you missed it, here's what we've done.\\"<br />Fans of Cathedral will find something to like on this CD to like regardless of what aspect of the band they like.<br />If taken completely out of the context of the band, this is a wonderfully dark and morose album.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The bass and drums are a little uninspired due to the slower tempo of the CD.<br />The songs can be a tad ponderous and take hard turns.<br />I can't say I'm in love with Cathedral's fascination with 70's psychedelic cheesiness. I know it's their thing, but I don't get it.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />It's kind of sad to see these guys trudge off into the murky darkness, but as they point out in their songs, all things die. The Last Spire is a strong final release by a band whose musical identity is trying not to have one. Current fans and fans of doom metal will enjoy this CD; most of everyone else will shrug it off as a curiosity, as they have for 20 years, and move on to something else.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This is the second of three movies (the third now in theaters, June 2013) by the very original director Linklater and all three are a total treat--smart, funny, sexy, original. They follow the joys and tribulations of two people, one French, one American, who meet for a night in Vienna (Before Sunrise), then 9 years later for a day in Paris (Before Sunset), and years later we find them together again in Greece (Before Midnight). It is all talk, but of a calibre of conversation and banter seldom caught in any but the best of novels.
1476733953|3.0|Wool starts strong, but then it drags and ends weak.<br /><br />The writing really cries out for editing. For all the talk of how the Internet-publishing revolution is turning publishing on its ear, this book shows the downside of it. A good editor would've reigned things in at points, cleaned up the copy, and punched up the text.<br /><br />The writing is not great, though the story is good.<br /><br />I do plan on reading the next installment--which I bought for Kindle midway through reading Wool--but I'm in no hurry.<br /><br />There is too much description and long exposition about processes in this book. It reads very technical at many points.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book breaks ground in understanding near death experiences. It is highly important to understand that this was a highly advanced medical doctor sharing his experience. I highly recommend it to the skeptics as  well as believers.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|Don't bother wasting your time on this movie, unless you enjoy napping with the TV on.  Such a disappointment.  I threw the DVD in the trash right after watching it.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|It was a quick read, not a very complex piece of fiction. He was much better with the continuing Dune series.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The first book was very good - I found Eva a little too annoying, a little too blunt, but the scenes were hot, and Gideon was intriguing.  Second book - very good, kept me entertained, interesting twists.  Third book - what the heck?  She spends a lot of time circling back on characters and reminding us that Eva is new to New York (really - like I couldn't tell!) - for what?  No one would read this book without the other two.  And then it's drawn out, stretched, and it feels too thin... because she's adding more books.  Aha.  The trilogy becomes five books.  Why not just tell the story as it was intended, then add a second trilogy with another chapter of Eva & Gideon's life?<br /><br />Add the frustration, the annoying little phrases that Eva tosses out (gotcha there, Ace), the lack of any real intimacy or growth in the characters (especially her roommate) and it becomes just a countdown until their marriage.  Or their second marriage.  Whatever.  My advice?  Read the first two, skip the rest, and if you want to know what happens, nothing happens and they live happily ever after.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Fun game app where you move pudding globs around until they are connected together. The main goal is to cover all the squares on the board with a blob. Each level increases in difficulty while you are also given different types of pudding globs and powers to accomplish your goal. All ages will enjoy this game since just getting all the blobs to connect is enough to finish a level regardless if any of the squares are covered or not.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|This film was a surprise in that it was far better than I expected it to be. The initial purpose in purchasing it was that it appeared silly, there are times when well done foolishness is just what you want.<br />The spin on witches was excellently conceived, there was an great detail given to provide something creepy and new. They succeeded impressively.<br />Where it falls is in the atavism. Certain amounts are fine, as in the beginning when they were putting pictures of missing children tied to milk bottles. It is when they break out of their own rules that it becomes a problem.<br />Hansel and Gretel are equipped with not only automatic weapons but a taser. Everyone else in this environment is reduced to the standard medieval peasant weaponry of pitchforks and torches along with basic ball and powder guns (with the exception of the \\"Sheriff\\" who carries a six shooter).<br />Some of the plot points are cliche and painfully obvious but thankfully they do not factor largely into the overall development. Along these lines, though, are the reasons why I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Hansel and Gretel\\".<br />While trying to avoid spoilers I will say that as you're sitting there thinking, \\"Okay, this is going to happen\\", the opposite develops.<br />At points I was reminded slightly of Terry Gilliam; the dark use of strange subject matter. If this sort film is not to your taste than avoid it.<br />If, however, you are intrigued by the bizarre it is worth at least one viewing. Just realize that you are dealing with Hansel and Gretel, a certain amount of credulity is required. Once you get past the ridiculous nature of the subject matter it is quite enjoyable.
1781162646|5.0|I want to start my review by copying/pasting a post I wrote in the amazon discussion boards in response to all the complaints about there not being an e-book for this novel available at this time. This also goes out to everyone posting a 1 star review for the same reason. Also I use the words TRUE FANS in my review title because real and true fans of Stephen King could care less about the publication form and collect his works because there are few authors who can write the amazing novels/short-story collections that are so imaginative and descriptive and in so many genres as SK does.  I understand that there are some readers who need e-books for reasons of eyesight, arthritis, etc. I have enough faith in SK that he will eventually put this novel in other forms besides paperback like he has in other publications that were released in only one form to start with.<br /><br />SK has a long history of publishing his stories/novels only in certain formats for the express purposes of creating an atmosphere. The ones that come to mind are The Mist, The Storm of the Century, the joint publications of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer and Rose Red, and finally UR. The Mist was originally published as a \\"3-d sound\\" audiobook. In the hopes of enhancing his readers imagination this short story was made into an audiobook with a unique 3-d sound stereo effect. With the background noise, excellent voice actors, 3-d stereo effect, etc. the fear and panic the characters feel was geniusly portrayed (if you can find it I highly recommend this to all). This was eventually published in a short story collection, adapted into movie format and can also be purchased individually. The Storm of the Century was published as a \\"novel for television.\\" SK did this not only because the larger cast of characters would make this almost impossible to publish it in just one book in written form, but in order to portray the immensity of the storm. Once again this was eventually released in written form (the script was published in paperback). I have both the script and the movie and I love to read the script while watching the movie to see the differences. Another concept SK tried in order to enhance the atmosphere intended was the joint publication of the book The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer and the movie Rose Red. Under the pseudonym Joyce Reardon SK published in paperback form The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer in order to provide a more detailed background into not only the characters, but also the house (a character in its own rights) Rose Red. The cover of the book has a note for readers to watch Stephen King's Rose Red. Publishing the book before the movie once again helped to enhance the readers (or in this case the watchers) imagination and create the intended atmosphere. Last on my list is the more recent UR. Because of the theme this was originally published in e-book format. You definitely would have not shared the characters feelings if this was first read in paperback form. Hence SK decision, once again, to publish this in only one form at first (this can now be purchased in audiobook form.<br /><br />on to my actual review. this novel was as much of a great read as all his others are. I don't want to go into any detail of the story and ruin it for other readers with spoilers, so here is a small description. the basis of the novel is about a college student who gets a summer job at an amusement park, makes friends with others that are both living in the same boarding house, but also on the same \\"work team\\" at the park. at the park learns about the local legend regarding the funhouse's history and the resultant haunting. from there it just gets better and better as only Stephen King can do. the story's main character, Devin, is now much older and is narrating the story through flashbacks. at times while trying to tell about a certain part that happened during that summer the character seemed to get sidetracked with other side stories. at first I found that annoying.but, I started to think that that is what people do in real life so why is that not portrayed as much in novels. So I actually found that feature to increase the realism of the story for me. yes, I know this is fiction, but we all read books with our imaginations flowing as if the story is happening for real.<br /><br />in conclusion I encourage anyone who is a fan of mystery books to give this a try. Even if you aren't a fan of SK I think you would enjoy this novel as his descriptions aren't as \\"hard core\\" as some of his longer books. some have stated they dislike his work if he gets too descriptive with violence and/or sex for their taste to handle. that is not the case here so I think you could take a chance with this one.but, I started to think that that is what people do in real life so why is that not portrayed as much in novels.

B00BUADSMQ|2.0|The problem with \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" was evident with the apparent fear the movie makers had in their own subject matter. As you watch you can hear the voices whispering in their ears, \\"They really went after Sylvester Stallone for being to old for Rambo\\".<br />What they hadn't considered was that Bruce Willis has enough charisma to carry it off, as evidenced by the last film in the franchise. Once they finally get started there is a car chase that feels as if it will never end. This nightmare of a sequence really seemed to be aimed at, \\"John McClain can still drive a car even if he can't dangle from skyscrapers\\".<br />The other side of this was the break with the \\"hook\\" of the Die Hard series of McClain being a reluctant hero. He is a man forced into doing things he really doesn't want to do. Here they actually say \\"The family business is killing bad guys\\". They come off like Dexter without the sense of humor.<br />From top to bottom this film was a failure and was just a transparent rip off, trying to grab at the consumers cash by offering up substandard fair with an established product.<br />While it isn't worth the rental, getting \\"A Good Day to Day Harder\\" via On Demand is much better than allowing this disc to take up the quarter inch of shelf space which would be better used collecting dust.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|You are given a board filled with colored marbles. The goal is to move the marbles and make a line of three or more to clear different squares on the board. The difficulty increases as the game progresses. What I really like is that even though you technically only have three lives (with the possibility to earn more) when you run out of lives the game will restart at the current level. So you really have unlimited lives. In the latter levels you may have to replay them several times to finish the level, but I like that I don't have to continually restart the entire game. There are about five boards per level.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|The 1939 movie, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" has developed a life of its own and a huge following of loyal fans. To try and produce a movie tied in with that classic would be a formidable challenge for anyone. As fans will do they start filling in the story gaps left by the movie in their imaginations and creating their own versions of the unexplained parts of the story.<br /><br />Any movie that comes out will be compared to countless personal versions of Oz and either applauded of condemned based on the extent to which it either measures up or fails to measure up to each personal standard. On first viewing of this movie I left it with serious questions unanswered as to whether I liked it or not. As I reflected on the movie I later came to feel it was better than I was initially willing to give it credit for and began to feel it had merit on its own.<br /><br />I believe once one is over the initial adjustment period with the movie that it will wear reasonably well; I'm actually looking forward to watching it again since I've had some time now to digest what it was trying to say. Being a collector I'm glad I've added it to my collection and hope to come to terms with what it is trying to say to the viewer.<br /><br />While it is not what I expected I would be hard put to accurately define what exactly it was that I did expect. If you're a fan of Oz I recommend you give it a chance and see it its message strikes any resonant chords in your expectations.

B0041D843M|4.0|Rarely have I read a book twice. Never have I read a book on this topic twice.  I am absolutely convinced that this is life-saving, critical health improving data. I stopped eating meat in the early 70's, a demonstration of a modicum of discipline.  Since reading this book the first time, I've exhibited true discipline by dropping dairy and eggs. My beloved butter, cheese and cream are off the menu.<br /><br />To be honest, I have been eating a small amount of fish on occasion but I'm weaning myself off that as well.<br /><br />You cannot read this book and say you're confused about the mixed messages regarding what you should or should not eat.  It's an easy read and from my perspective a 'quality of life' message that's critical for everyone.  I used to feel that I shouldn't push my food beliefs on others. I now feel compelled to get those I care about to read this. After that if they continue their old dietary habits, I will know that I tried to get them on the right path.<br /><br />I'm fired up and planning to have blood work done as soon as possible to see if I have improved on my already good to excellent stats.<br /><br />If you believe that good health is one of your top five quality of life issues, read this book and put copies on the e-readers or in the hands of everyone you know and love.

B00797MB0O|5.0|Ignore the whiny reviews of \\"oh, this film is sad\\" and blah blah.  This film does a fantastic job in a deliciously bittersweet kind of way. The characters are so real you can almost smell them. If you like business-as-usual, cookie cutter rom-coms, please don't review this film; you're hurting its rankings. If you like outside-the-box commentary on generational issues, women's issues, coming-of-age issues, and life-balance issues, then please watch this film, and say a silent prayer for Diablo Cody, in hopes that Hollywood will keep funding her movies.

B001VNB54A|5.0|The content is excellent, but restricted. The scope of the subject material is so large, any audiovisual treatment cannot do it justice.<br /><br />I find though, that the product I received has an audio track that deteriorates starting with disk 4 and continues to the final disk.<br />After checking through my Panasonic Blu-ray w/Dolby, the audio track in those disks gets worse, fading in and out.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|If I was to pick one book in the stacks of self-help books I have been exposed to in my life, this one would not be on top of the stack...<br /><br />It would replace the stack.<br /><br />Bold statement, eh? So lets say that in one fell swoop, someone shows you how to get whatever your heart desires. First by establishing it as a truth that one's subconscious mind accepts as truth. Then by daily affirmations. Really... just that simple.<br />The conscious mind comes up with the question, desire, etc. The subconscious mind goes to work (actually its always at work waking or sleeping) to get what you have placed before it. A lost trinket. a missing word that you're looking for? The next day in the middle of breakfast it comes to you! (example). That's the subconscious mind on the job!<br />Murphy uses such authors as Mark Twain to bring out his point. Ask and ye shall receive!<br /><br />The mystery has been revealed! But there is danger.<br />The subconscious mind can't take a joke! You say perhaps, I can never get to work on time. This, your subconscious mind accepts as truth. Firstly because it is received on an emotional level. (that look your boss gave you!) The subconscious mind  then goes to work make sure your words are obeyed &#34;I can never get to work on time.&#34; becomes the reality of your life. scary!<br /><br />Take heart, though.<br />This is just a small sample of the negative direction things can go. The book is laden with happy and healthy affirmations.<br />I finished the book... and started reading it from the beginning.<br /><br />Never been a religious person. I like science. This book does not insult one's intelligence with dogmatic statements but places scripture where applicable to the content. Totally pallatable.

B0089LOG02|5.0|If you like historical fiction, and even if you don't, read ORPHAN TRAIN.  While sadly realistic, it was also uplifting.  The characters show that many people have endured difficulties they never should have to experience, and still rise above their circumstances to live good, happy, and even outstanding lives.  Also, the story should remind all of us how lucky most of us in the USA are to live now.

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I download a bunch of random TV shows onto my Kindle, and this little beauty removes the trouble of having to convert them via Vuze. You can even download straight from the internet onto the Kindle and then play it with Mobo.

B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game, I could play it all day long.  It is easy to play &amp; lots of fun.  It's appropriate for all ages, so adults &amp; kids can enjoy this game.  I'm an adult and I spend lots of my free time playing this game.  I like that it can be played without the wi-fi(wireless) feature because I can enjoy the game in the car, at the mall, or where ever I am I can really enjoy playing this awesome game.
B0072OFM28|2.0|I didn't really like the stories and what was happing. They killed off some of the actors and actress from the first season in a way that i didn't like. The sex just seemed to be in for not a very good reason. The two gay men were not shown doing very much at all not like the first season. I think they got cold feet and didn't want to go very far. I don't see why they couldn't have gotten someone to play spartacus that had a lot more muscles. I told a friend that I did't think it was worth buying and will not get if for my collection.

1781162646|4.0|I enjoyed this novel very much.  That might be because it was a quick read.  It might be because King's tendency for characters to occasionally speak in nonexistent slang that sounds ridiculous (I wanted to throw The Stand across the room every time the phrase \\"happy crappy\\" was used) actually makes sense here, as several of the characters are carnies, who really do have their own secret language.  As a fan of the Dark Tower series, I was glad to read a Stephen King story that had NOTHING to do with that series.  Joyland is a straightforward coming-of-age tale about a college student who gets a summer job working at a dying amusement park in North Carolina.  Along the way, he befriends a single mother and her dying son, and investigates a decade-old murder at the park.  Joyland is King's second book for the Hard Case Crime imprint, but despite that, and the pulp-style cover, this is a Stephen King story through and through.  There are ghosts and physic abilities involved, but these elements are kept to a minimum and don't overshadow the story and characters.  The characters are well-drawn, likable, and relatable (which King's Constant Readers can usually count on), and the ending, unlike that of 11/22/63, feels satisfying.  Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I have played this game before, but it is nice how you can change the playing background on the card table.  Also you can change between Vegas &amp; standard scoring.  I don't play it as much as some other games, but it is an ok way to pass the time.

You can even flip through the pages as if reading an actual notebook.  It is one of my favorite note taking apps.  I'd recommend it for anyone that likes to take their info. with them, just type it in &amp; the app will save it for you to read again later.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this game is the suckys game I have ever played!!! who the hell made this damn game? you suck bigtime!!!!!
B0064MGU98|4.0|I really like this show. I was surprised at first because I figured this would be something my mom would watch, but the acting is so good. it is a courtroom drama with side plots that are actually interesting to follow.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I didn't even know about Fringe until my son told me about it a few months ago.  I recently subscribed to Amazon Prime and have been watching Fringe every change I get.  I can't believe I missed such a great show.  I'm only watching a couple shows a week so I can really enjoy the series.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always played on my computers.  Playing on the kindle is easy and so much fun. I want it on my phone too.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Downloaded for free.  App does exact what it says.  If I had go pay for it., I would pay for it.  Shows how much battery time I have on my fire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, now I wanna stop writing this review so I can get back to the game FLOW. Like I told you, ADDICTING!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My favorite Bingo game, and I have many downloaded!  I just wish credits were more plentiful!!  It is very enjoyable...even addictive!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my sons favorite game. Keeps him busy when you need him to be. Great entertainment for someone if any age.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Worst book ever, bad stpry line too. I think after dog days thiz book went down heel.cabin fever, ugly truth, and this one is pretty lame
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think these readers are being so harsh! When I read these types of books, I expect guilty pleasure, not Pulitzer Prize winning fiction. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to Book #4!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Read the Book and had to see it in the Movies.<br />They did the Movie just like the Book which is Awesome!!!
0399160450|5.0|I never miss a Clancy Jack Ryan book. I bought this once read and it arrive in bookshelf new condition. A great way to enjoy a good. Also came with a buy back offer!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It might be weird that girls like me are interested in these kind of games but it is an awesome game. One thing that u need to know is that u can't say that girls can't play games it is sexist u know what I mean and not in that kind of way. Anyway, it is an awesome risk taking game. I want u guys to get it if u don't have the minute u play u will fall in love with it. Anyway, get the game.
0394721772|5.0|Got it about 30 minutes ago, and I'm already a third of the way through it!!! I cannot wait to cook something out of it!!!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Think about it.  How many of Tony's age peers are putting out stuff nowadays as good/heavy as this?  I can only think of Lemmy.....but he's a bassist.  Eric Clapton?  Uh, name anything post-Cream that is listenable. The guy's a wussy.  Blackmore?  Now plays renaissance minstrel music. Ditto wussy...even more troubling since he used to play thru 200W Marshall Majors and smash the Strat at every gig!  Beck?  Hasn't been heavy since Beck-Ola. Has the chops but plays jazz/fusion/everything BUT heavy rock.  Page?  Except for the one-off Zep reunion, nada.  Ted Nugent? ONly cares about hunting and right-wing politics. Yet here we are in 2013, Tony has freaking cancer and is pushing 70 (as the rest of them), and we are given this slab of doom metal with 3/4 of the original Sabbath that shows the kiddies how it's done.  Simply Amazing. Sure without this you could sub  Uncle Acid or Orchid but these guys started it all. Buy the vinyl and  Play Loud on a good stereo system(none of this crappy MP3/iPOD junk)!!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|this app worked better on my Iphone. now I have a Galaxy and I cant ever get the map to work right.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This is a good solid action movie with an interesting story.  It did a good job of keeping me awake, passing some time, and wondering what kind of secret stuff our government is up to.  But was it an amazing movie, the kind that really makes me think, and that I'll remember for a long time?  No.  But that's OK, I didn't really expect that.  Hence 4 stars.
B005544V6A|5.0|A few of the plot twists are less than believable, but you don't really care.  Its a fun ride, yeah.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|A student of mine turned me on to Lindsey's music.  As someone who is quite a geek, I really enjoy her music especially when driving.  I tend to focus more on the violin when I am listening, so the techno / dub-step is more just background.  I listen to a variety of music ranging from classical to heavy metal and this just fits with certain moods and situations, such as driving.  I would love to see her in concert after watching some of her videos on youtube.  I hope she puts out an album of some of her cover songs like the video games.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Since we now have a BlueRay player, there was no reason to only buy the DVD Saga....and so glad we got this in BR.  It's great!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I am 13 and finished it in three days. I have a disabled brother so I really enjoyed it a lot to see how he may feel sometimes.  I highly recommend this book, great read. Also It teaches you a lesson
075666733X|2.0|Made for Jr. HIGH.....NOT FOR ADULTS. VERYIMITED INFO.RETURNING...& I am not one who returns items often. Also, 2 day shipping is no longer on time .  Budget cuts??????
B0080BFVPU|5.0|This movie is one of the few that I will watch many times over the years. The incongruity of Cusacks character, Joan Cusacks awesome office assistant role and Dan Ackroids hit man organizer character entertain again and again
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Good character and plot development. They wrap up the legal stuff in a nice bow every episode, but give tease you with nice social cliffhangers to make you want to watch the next episode immediately.
B0060D2SU6|4.0|I am a sometime fan of his but this movie tickled me. Ohh Billy. Anna Faris is always spot on and Rachel McAdams had a part that was somewhat small but you can see the actor that became Irene Adler in Sherlock Holmes
B00821OX98|5.0|I love the show because it is fresh. Suspense in every show. Just overall a wonderful and exciting series. I was like a kid on Christmas eve awaiting the Sunday premier of season 3
B0086213XW|4.0|Not much into blood and guts but sure like just a nice &#34;real&#34; time movie.  This was very entertaining.<br />In fact, it was so good that I considered running it again.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this cd very much! My fav songs are: Gorilla, Natalie and of course the ones they are playing on the radio. This boy is very talented! I hope he keeps it up!
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|In the first five minutes of \\"Gangster Squad,\\" one man is torn in half at the midsection, while another has his hand lopped off by an elevator. And that's just for starters.<br /><br />Set in 1949 Los Angeles, this low-rent version of \\"L.A. Confidential\\" mixed with \\"The Untouchables\\" is based on the true-life account of Mickey Cohen, a Chicago mobster who's using prostitution, drug running and gambling as a means of building his own empire on the west coast. Trouble is, in the process, he's managed to not only alienate his former partners back in the Midwest but to fire up law enforcement in L.A. (those not already in his back pocket, that is) who feel that he will soon take over the city if he isn't stopped.<br /><br />Enter homicide detective Sergeant John O'Mara, an upstanding Irish war hero who's been assigned the unenviable task of driving Cohen out of business by whatever means necessary. This involves gathering together a merry band of like-minded, trustworthy individuals (the \\"gangster squad\\") who'll help him do the job. But how far outside of the law are they willing to go to bring about their desired end?<br /><br />As directed by Ruben Fleischer, \\"Gangster Squad\\" could not possibly feel more halfhearted, enervating and hackneyed at this stage in movie history. The screenplay by Will Beall is practically an encyclopedia of mob movie stereotypes and cliches, and the dialogue and voice-over narration are often jaw-dropping in their banality.<br /><br />Sean Penn scowls his way through the part of Cohen, while Josh Brolin, as O'Mara, sleepwalks through his. Ditto for Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone and \\"The Killing's\\" Mireille Enos, whose roles here are unworthy of their not inconsiderable talents.<br /><br />With so many fine crime dramas floating around, both in movies and on TV, there's really no reason to settle for so thoroughly generic an offering as \\"Gangster Squad.\\"
B009IUH1N2|2.0|it is difficult to get. I thought it would be a good game for my grandson but its not. I even have trouble playing it
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Personally I really enjoy the game. Yeah some of the ponies are over priced (I'm 2 gems away from Rarity) I've never bought any gems, and don't  plan to. It's still an enjoyable game. Add me: ninjahsamurai
B003Z49LYO|4.0|It didn't end the way I expected.  It seemed to be the usual &#34; poor girl&#34;  story  -but I don't want to give it away.
B00004RFG0|5.0|always loved this movie, glad i was still able to get it, was in great condition thank you so much  angie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you love post apocalyptic or dystopian society stories, you will love this!! I am absolutely hungry for more. A definite must-read.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|I enjoyed this game a lot. Then it glitched and i lost about 40,000 game dollars that i had spent on gadgets because it all locked up. I sent a message to halfbrick but no answer. Disappointing!!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Her last few books have been such a dissappointment. The series must be taking up all her time. Too bad for Sookie, she could have had such a better ending
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is amazing!! So many levels, so much fun, so many bloons!!! A few complaints; the agents and other things that cost monkey money should be cheaper, and the level-ups should be easier to get. But so addictive!!!! Can barely put it down. Thumbs up!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I give it five stars if you get it on the kindle fire HD not blotchy at all I like how hard it is to get a new character like titanium or spike I also like the daily challenges and extra characters that are only limited time very interesting and detailed game!
B005PK57NU|5.0|This third season continues to hold interest with the twists and turns of the legal cases.  Amazing how involved one can become!
B008OOYALE|3.0|It's an ok game, but dragonvale is better. Honestly, this was an amazing concept, however dragonvale was thought out better, has better graphics, and has hundreds more dragons.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I downloaded this through the Amazon app store. Works and runs great. Awesome time killer and my nephew loves to play it as well.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is awesome and very interactive. Enjoying playing with friends. Can not wait till the next phase opens up. Would recommend.
B00821OX98|5.0|Saw first episode and got hooked!! Must watch! Alien version of walking dead. Suspenseful, action, drama. Season 3 just started!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app, great features, accurate, check it every morning, every night, count on it for planning my outdoor fun!!
B004DK49DW|5.0|I think other people summed it up pretty clearly - this is a great album.  Fits Social D's  style, but has enough newness to keep you interested.  I dumped this set of mp3s on a memory stick with three or four other albums - my own &#34;Social Distortion mix tape&#34;, and played it non stop in my car for weeks.  These fit in with the rest of the songs, but still stand alone.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is the best strategy game I've ever played, very addictive game ,might even be better then cut the rope!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game. Have had to reload twice due to freeze ups which means starting over - didn't like that - but overall a good game.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I recently decided to upgrade CPUs.I was previously on the Intel i3-3220.This CPU has been at a steady $220 for the last couple months.When I seen it drop to $199, I ordered right away.I thought the price drop was permanent due to Haswell releasing, but no luck.<br /><br />So far I have had ZERO problems with this CPU.Also, going from Dual core to Quad core has a clearly visible impact on gaming, my primary use for my PC.<br /><br />If you are currently on an i3, or lower, I recommend this CPU.But if you are looking for a boost in game performance visually, get a good graphics card first, then upgrade processor.<br /><br />My games used to get semi-laggy which I thought was my connection or GPU.But after putting the i5 in, that was the problem.<br /><br />Specs:<br />i5-3570k<br />XFX 7870 Double D 2gb<br />8gb (2x4) GSkill @ 1600mhz<br /><br />Edit:This processor is still 100% working properly.I do not have a chipset that allows me to overclock, so I am running it @ 3.8 ghz.It is running about 30-35c idle, and maybe 55-60c at load.I primarily play Battlefield 3.This CPU has drastically improved in-game quality since upgrading from the Intel i3-3220.<br /><br />Even with Haswell out, I think the 3570k still should be looked into.If you are serious about PC gaming, the i5-3570k is the best choice for you, unless you can afford an i7.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Although I wanted a bit more closure at the end, this is a great John Corey novel. DeMille is getting more sarcastic (via Corey) but that actually makes Corey more likable....the bullies don't win in John Corey's world.
159463176X|4.0|I'm going to steal from another reviewer's title as it sums up my feelings exactly:  \\"Brilliant beginning; waning ending.\\"  I couldn't put the book down when I started.  The depictions of life in rural Afghanistan were so well drawn especially the character of the young boy who so lovingly takes care of his little sister.  The life of a woman who takes care of her disabled sister is heartbreaking.  The \\"selling\\" of the young girl to a wealthy woman and the person of her husband are so well portrayed.  The relationship of that husband with his chauffeur/cook is also believable and touching.<br /><br />Then something happens.  The skipping around between time periods starts to become a bit hard to follow.  Characters begin to appear that don't seem to quite fit the picture.  And there is one chapter set in Greece where a young boy and his disfigured friend are taking a picture with a \\"homemade\\" camera which totally threw me.  I honestly thought perhaps there was an error in the download - did I miss something?<br /><br />That aside, this is still a very good read which portrays how families are split apart, both literally and figuratively.  This is a story of survival and recovery.  It is a story of pain and of love.  It is a story of a people in a country torn apart by war and poverty.  Perhaps this is not as gripping as \\"Kite Runner\\", but it is still a worthwhile read by a very good author.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in awhile.  It does remind me of early Scott Turow with the building suspense.  I had a hard time putting it down.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|ok this is a great saga and a big stepping stone in scifi (the original trilogy being the stepping stone). i love star wars watched it first at age of 5 with parents walked into theater after episode 4, empire strikes back, had started and was love at first sight but there are caviots that everyone knows about that watched the first trilogy and their continual editing of those 3 as fx tech improved. first they changed the visuals making objects added in less see through no big deal there then they added scenes they had already had actors in but couldnt finish originally cause... well its hard to make a giant slug the size of a man walk around while talking to Han lol. that was a bit of a >.< moment but i thought ok i can live with that it was actually cool to find out that george actually thought to get han to do that scene for when tech could make jabba walk. then there was the part that i really really hate, changing darth vader's ghost of anakin at the end of return of the jedi, i have to admit i have only heard of this as i refuse to watch that movie cause of that change. why cant they just leave loved classics alone instead of making them \\"better\\"
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|\\"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.\\"
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|Lots of action, good guy flick, although the plot is a little unbelievable.  The special effects are well done, sappy ending.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|The movie was entertaining enough but not nearly as good as other in the &#34;crime/mob&#34; genre. Sean Penn did a nice job as did Josh Brolin but the movie dragged at times and some of the characters were so quickly defined that you didn't really care about them and their situation.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the book. Hope the movie is as good as the book (whenever it gets made).  Can't wait to see Catching Fire later this year too.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Everything in the book resonated with me and some of the experiences described are uncannily and uncomfortably familiar. I wholeheartedly agree with taking the movement forward.
B00821OX98|5.0|Plenty of holes and unexplained things through the story line. But over all this is just great sci-fi. Things do become clearer the more you watch though.
B000SI939S|5.0|One thing I found about this book that was so great is that it tells you what happens to the characters and adds some that weren't in the movie. I DEFINITELY recommend this book!
B000BISBDY|5.0|ALWAYS LISTENED TO HIM WAY BACK......HAD EVERY ALBLUM HE EVER PUT OUT!  WAS A GREAT CHOICE........GREAT SONGS........GREAT VALUE  RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book but thought his first 2 books were much better.  This book jumped around a lot and could be a little confusing.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Young folks are so sure of themselves and the world has so much to teach. Either be wise or develop some \\"special skills\\".  Think about it . . .
B009AMANBA|5.0|I cannot phraise this purchase enough. I was very impressed with the quality and delivery of my selection. What a wonderful viewing experience...Like being there on the battlefields or in Washingon, D.C. during Lincolin's Presidency. Thank You Again. DCAdams
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies & I can't wait for the sequels. Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress & the movie's pace is thrilling.
B007STXHTM|5.0|It worked perfectly got the underwater video feed back to normal and with no fish eye plus added the Red filter and now the colors are back into a natural state!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I thought the story had promise but you never understood the characters problems. Why did she live in the Blue Room, have the baby almost alone, suffer so with nursing, starve herself ?  Why did he live alone, learn to love her, finally make peace with his aunt?  Why did the aunt suffer alone all those years, seek foster care or even want a child?<br /><br />So many questions but so few answers.
B0000029AP|5.0|When I first heard this album, yeah it was on vinyl back in the mid 70s,I didn't know what a Toy in the Attic was,,, now I can't seem to get rid of my own.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|My son got this and loves it.  I have to say he hasn't cussed about the game not responding correctly so I assume it means this mouse is more accurate than a normal control.
B004PZ4HC8|3.0|This was an easy, casual read. World war Z randomly chronicles the war against the zombies through the viewpoints of different relevant characters around the world and the part they played in the fight. I didn't fall in love with the book, but I found it mostly entertaining, nevertheless. I'm curious how the movie will parallel this book, if it does. It was worth reading, but don't expect the best book you've ever read.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The only reason I gave it 4 stars is b/c of cost. Otherwise it's an awesome game with a good story line, great graphics, and spooky music. Love the hidden objects,you actually have to spend a little time looking :)
B008H04T84|5.0|The book showed up in perfect condition and it's a great book so you should totally read it! :)<br />Thank you!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I liked this novel and would recommend it for reading. It has various unexpected plots and twists that will keep you interested in the outcome.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun game. The vehicle upgrades add a good bit of variety, as do the different maps. I also really like that you can get items without paying real money. It takes a while but it's fun.
0988936402|4.0|Think you had problems adjusting to college your freshman year? Compared to what Owen Sage faces, it was nothing. His initial problem of deciding which clubs to join quickly pale to deciding how to adjust to two different realities. Owen is transported from Easton Falls University and the everyday world and to Everville, the other dimension, where the battle between good and evil rages, threatening even his world. With the help of the Keeper in Everville and the Fron, as well as the help of his college friends, notably Anika and Dante, Owen struggles to keep the evil Them from simultaneously destroying Everville and his world. I liked the way the author handled the back and forth between the the worlds. I thought the ending was a bit rushed, but other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Can't wait till the next in the series comes out!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The main characters and all the supporting characters have very nice chemistry. I hope that season six flows with a little bite more.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|this was a great facility and enjoying amazon prime. picture clarity was good. when is blu ray clarity movies coming to amazon.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book is super smart and entertaining. Orson Scott Card is a brilliant writer. His books a breath of fresh air.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I own several calculator app's-- this is the ONLY calculator where you can actually see your input up to the final calculation.  This is important, especially if you've got more than 10 lines in a calculation.<br /><br />Great app, fa sho!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I just got my kindle fire HD a few days ago and this app has already crashed a bunch of times. a little disappointed.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|When Amazon finally upgraded SBP for 2.5, you have all of the features that the SBP for iPad has.<br /><br />Although this is a priceless drawing, illustration, coloring app-- it has literally hundreds of different brushes and the ability to make more-- there's definitely a learning curve to be able to use all of the tools that are offered.  If you're a fan of Copic colors and multiple layers options, this upgrade will suit you very well.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Loaded with political and personal manipulation, sex, betrayal, and beheading. What's not to love? And personally there is no more beautiful a woman than Natalie Dormer.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Highly recommend for anyone! I wish all Christian movies had as good of a story line as this. An all-around WONDERFUL movie!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Whatever happened to games, now you have to pay to play. If you wanna do the basics it's an ok game but if you wanna do more you have to pay.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have read all three of the Theodore Boone books and love them.  He always gets into some sort of mess and has to think his way out.  Good read, fun and you find yourself rooting for this young man!
B00B78AIV0|5.0|This novel hits a home run. The characters, especially the young female narrator, but all the others in the family, are very well developed. The violence is evident from page one, but it is SO hidden. It's never overt, but couched in Christian values, that are always understated. So many issues like the competition to love the father more, to say what he wants you to say is SO chilling, so believable. The disdain for all things non-Christian is palpable. This African family grabs you in ways that few families do. Their truth is universal. I will definitely read this author again.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|You have a variety of sounds/music to choose to help you relax or even to concentrate.  I love to hear the ocean waves hitting the shore, the seagulls calling and the rain falling.  So soothing and I am off to sleep in no time.  Choose the combination of sounds you like and give it a try.
B009JBZH54|3.0|its really a great collection to have spatially if you are mad about ( batman ) movies but the only thing i don't like that the collection doesn't come with DTS sound system and is poor of spatial features
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|Easy to use and handy when you can't read it yourself but there is no inflections, no emotions and the punctuation isn't always noted.  Very computerized voice.  One word at a time - that's it.  For example:<br /><br />&#34; Chapter 8 Mike ran to the window he saw a large vehicle coming towards him it was so scary. &#34;  Word by word.  Very disconcerting!
B005LAIH9K|5.0|i just love the last American pie movie<br />and the must important thing in the movie is all the people who actor is back again
B009R659L8|4.0|Interesting book with an interesting plot and twist.  How believable was it?  Well, I'll let you figure that out.  She's a good writer and I enjoy most of her books, this one included.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham must have high expenses.  Lots of wordsmith work but not much to keep reading it, put it down anytime and pick it up when you're bored with other reading.
1608955702|5.0|Ok here it is. Best book on photography yet. Not only is it laid out so it is easy to read it is also intuitively put and easy to understand. I felt so inspired after just the first 1/2 that when I saw this gorgeous unique girl at the food court I stopped and ask if I could have her information so I could photograph her (damn not bringing my camera with me to the store!). This book is very encouraging and inspiring. In fact I probably shouldn't tell everyone about it since there is this thing called competition. Oh well. Read it!
B003QTSMXE|4.0|I don't like animated flicks but my husband does, and he roared with laughter during much of it....It put me to sleep, however, some of the parts were quite entertaining...with a good theme.
B00CABLXU8|5.0|Came in yesterday. No scratches or nothing, looks like I bought it directly from a store. Listening to it now!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really like this book because it has a deformed kids life. I have learned something from this. I think you should read this book.
B001XV09UG|5.0|I usually like to read about the movie or watch the trailer, but with this one I just went for it with my husband.<br />Definitely a film to see with your couple, it gets the best and worst of emotions at once, specially because I'm the type of person that  talks to the TV.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Author did a phenomenal job with the first two books. This was my least favorite.<br />Still a big fan of Hossenini.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I recently jumped back into building Legos and I wanted something challenging. Well this model delivers that! The scale of the model is awesome and looks fantastic finished. I have seen quite a few pictures of it completed on the internet but those really don't do it the justice it deserves when it is finished and sitting in your own space.<br /><br />Hats off to the design team! They managed to keep the model relatively light yet fairly solid when finally assembled. I really enjoy seeing unique solutions during the building process and has given me a few ideas for some MOCs of my own.<br /><br />A couple of cautionary notes: This model has a ton of small 1x1 modified bricks, and 1x2 bricks. If you are not paying close attention to some parts of the instructions when building out the longer portions of the ship's structure you could run into alignment problems later on. However, I was very pleasantly surprised how well everything matched up and fit together at the end.<br />Working through the Numbered bags and spending the extra few minutes to sort the parts helps the build process and is well worth the time.<br /><br />Might be a little pricey but given the amount of Legos and the finished results I felt well worth it. Very satisfying build!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoy any book that involves a good story line with witchcraft, spells, vampires, etc...  This book series seems to have it all with love, tragedy, suspense, heartbreak, intrigue, etc..  I look forward to the next book.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|the game is a little difficult to play. i like how you are able to unlock characters as you play, but it some have ridiculous prices, considering the amount of money you earn in a run and how far you go. this is a good time-passer and if the game were 99. cents, it wouldn't be worthwhile. But considering it is free, it is a good game to have if you tend to let others play on your kindle or other device, it will catch their eye.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I really liked this movie because I loved the special effects and the awesome sound quality. I don't believe this was as big a hit at the box office as it should have been but I enjoyed it far more than Batman, Clash of the Titans, and many more of the sci-fis.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|What a fun game you have fun you can't put it down.My grandkids love this. I gave it five stars because of the fun.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|First two books were better.  A bit slow and long winded in areas. Good story line but you need long periods of quiet to sit and read it.
B00684J49U|5.0|We love this show!<br />Finally broke down and bought all 8 seasons<br />All DVDs are in great condition.<br />Watching them over and over again.
0765325950|4.0|It's hard to review this book, because I never thought I would see it.  I feel like it was already asking too much to get an end to this series, but Mr. Sanderson acquits himself well with trying his best to tie up the important loose ends.  The pacing is excellent, the story gets a little off course, some of the established characters aren't quite themselves, and the newly introduced and expanded characters (especially Androl and Pevara) are the highlight.  There are even a few genuine surprises.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think I could have excepted better, even if I wanted to.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|We love this show!<br />Finally broke down and bought all 8 seasons<br />All DVDs are in great condition.<br />Watching them over and over again.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very entertaining because the choices constantly change and challenge me to find the matches. I like this game. Enjoy it for yourself.
B00005JO9J|5.0|We love this show!<br />Finally broke down and bought all 8 seasons<br />All DVDs are in great condition.<br />Watching them over and over again.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|R.Lee Ermey does a spectacular job with this movie..Best vietnam movie yet! Matthew Modine amd other cast could not have been cast no better!!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|This CD is just as good as all their others. so many good songs.  Have been a huge fan and was not disappointed at all in this CD.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Just love their music.  Anxiously awaiting their next album.  Their music is unique and creative! &#34;CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT&#34; states my 11 year old granddaughter.  My daughter got me hooked on them and then I got my granddaughter hooked on them!
B007HO392S|5.0|There are so many good songs on this CD it makes it so worth the money.  I am happy I purchased this.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Everything I want for my daily weather is on my page, yes this page beats looking at three or more apps, thank you
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Great CD-full of wonderful songs.  I'm a huge fan of Zac Brown and this did not disappoint.  Well worth the money.
B008YBXQ7Q|3.0|Because i needed led lights to install in my expedition but i thought tht it would be a power source cord or maybe instruction on how to install them. & where can you install them i liked tht the strips are waterproofed but other then that i want recomend them to anyone unless they knew what they was doing
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I have played this game on my computer at home but it ended with a level that I wanted to continue.  I purchased this and find I am filling alot of my free time to this game.  Love it.  Recommend it highly to anyone.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|To store my pictures and files online so i can free up more space for my tablet to download more app
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Book 1&2- good, this one is bad.  Even the sex scenes were contrived, some out of place!  The character development of the receptionist was interesting but never finished.  I got the impression that the author was committed to writing this book by a deadline and rushed the book.  The sex filled in the gaps in the story line.  Too shallow for me!  I'm done with this author unless its a 99 cent book!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game it is definitely something to play when you have a little free time to yourself good luck to those playing
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The Best app I have purchased for my money. I ain't kidding. If you want something LIKE an alarm clock but NOT an alarm clock this is it. Enjoy!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is family fun. Great for kids or adults. I play all the time and so does my husband. There is quick level advancement so you don't get bored.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. You don't have to spend money but it does help in some instances. I play about once a day and it's an enjoyable time waster.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read this because I liked 50 shades. I was disappointed thought because I just didn't feel the chemistry between Eva and Gideon. I felt the description of the scenes were good but the whole romance just started way to early. I wish they could have had the courtship drawn out more instead of falling in love in day 1. it made it now real in my mind. I also felt like it was too much just like 50 shades.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My son has the game and it follows the story line of the game.  He really enjoyed the movie and watched it over and over.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's nice... but it's boring after a few weeks... LONG WEEKS!!! Other then that, I LOVE IT! I'm tired... good night.
B00A4SJ61W|5.0|This was a very funny movie. All of my kids liked it. There ages range from 10 - 16 years old. I wish they would make more movies like this that are family oriented. Rating from a stay at home mom.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|LOVE this series and can't possibly be done with it!  My biggest concern is  Will miss the announcement of the next installment!
B00APJLEGA|5.0|This was a fantastic movie and not scary at all. Very family oriented. But people of all ages would enjoy watching this one. Definitely put it on your list for summer movies.
0762445262|2.0|Seriously, this thing only makes a signal on a while tall when it's less than a foot away from it - Batman would shake is head in shame!
B009ANP4F4|4.0|If you're a fan of dancing, hit music, a love story line, then this movie is easy to love. As the franchise goes on and keeps pumping out movie after movie, it loses some of it's &#34;star value&#34;, but overall this remains to be a very good film. The Revolution protesting brings an interesting twist to their dancing. Check it out if you're a fan of the first three for sure!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|After watching &#34;Serenity&#34; I wasn't sure I would enjoy the TV series.  Fortunately, they are entirely different shows despite the same characters.  I saw that Firefly was described as a space western and I think that's an accurate description.  What makes the show &#34;work&#34; for me are the characters.  The diverse cast plays their roles with complexity and depth.  I really enjoyed the series.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Based on a book, which unfortunately I had never read--this coming-of-depressed-age story is one that any teen, young adult, or just an adult can enjoy. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller shine as costars and wallflowers. Very good movie, I'd recommend checking out this gem.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|When I looked at the rating of this film on Amazon, I couldn't believe it was only 2.7 out of 5 stars.  Then I looked at some of the bad reviews and it was clear why.  It seems most of the bad reviews are from people who want all of the DVD formats when buying this film on DVD.  Perhaps Amazon needs to have separate review areas, one for people who want to review the actual movie and one for those who want to complain about packaging and price of DVD's.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Disney did a great job with this prequel to the Wizard of Oz. If you watch the movie trailer and it looks good to you, you'll like the movie.  Just ignore the comments about DVD packaging, unless getting every DVD format at once is important to you.
B00005JLKN|5.0|This movie is excellent. Much better than the original movie made based off of Red Dragon. Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton both give excellent performances, while Ralph Fiennes reminds us as to why he was the perfect Voldemort.
B003EYVXXW|4.0|It would be better (for me) to have the director's comments in English, but the English text was still of benefit.  The physical product is good.  I did not buy it for entertainment, I am glad I didn't. The effort to mix scant history with art was a nice try.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|The growl of Bon Scotts voice calling &#34;Its a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n Roll) started the badder set of boys than &#34;The Rolling Stones&#34;. The music was a challenge on where rock and roll would turn as everyone who is old enough to notice the changes from one decade to another. No insult to the Stones or their fans. I have albums, CD's and DVD's. AD/DC cranked it up with &#34;High Voltage&#34;. Receiving waves of alt rock from the U.K. and Western Europe kept our rock alive.
1781162646|5.0|@ClubSTEPHENKING  I just finished Joyland and as always his novel just performed in front of my face with no awareness of reading. But I have  1 question. There is a loose end and I'm wondering if I missed it or its just dangling. I won't say what it is so as not to spoil anything but if anyone know what it is please let me know  Judy Hartman
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I think the photography was the best part of the movie. The story line and acting were excellent as well. Which story do you want to believe?
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story. A touching love story with a suspenseful ending. This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have read. Looking forward to reading more from him.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is a great app.  it's always good to be able to check the weather before you go on a trip. local weather news don't ways get it right
B002WJI66C|3.0|Ordered this for my son.  Totally surprised to find it ships from China and not Amazon.  If this was mentioned on the webpage it must have been well hidden.  As of now we are still waiting.  It seems it will be here next Monday, which while OK for a trip half way across the world is not what I was expecting.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is not a friendly user.  You have to search for what you looking for.  I have better luck on my phone. It's ok, not the best for me
B001XUYA0W|4.0|I don't like Sean Penn and Tim Robbins because of there politics but they are good actors and a this is a good movie.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|was very disappointed..i may give it another try at a later day. It was not simple enough for a search engine
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|OK, 14 epics books to this series but it I loved them all. Brandon Sanderson did a superb job of completing the series in light of Robert Jordan's sad passing in 2007. Absorbing characters, epic battles and a great mixture of magic and swordplay.
B002KKCVT6|5.0|Size 10 was way too big for my husband, although that's the size he normally wears in other shoes.  Return was no problem, and the size 8.5 that we purchased instead fit very well.  My husband is diabetic and suffers from chronic foot pain, but the Tevas give him excellent arch support without putting pressure on his feet.
B009X01C64|4.0|Great case for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch. The only thing I wish it had was a pocket on the binding for a stylus. Everything else about this case is great, I wouldn't change a thing. Highly recommended.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|The Reunion album showed great potential with additional tracks (psycho man & selling my soul), in hopes of a new album with the origional four.  But as time went on, nothing could get done.  Years later bypassing egos & lawsuits,  Black Sabbath comes out with a new album.<br /><br />At first, I was very skeptical on how this albumn would sound given the fact it took this long to get it done.  But listening to the songs, it was like taking a time machine 40 years back in time.  There are elements of the first five albums (More specifically their self- titled debut album & Sabatoge) in 13.<br /><br />Just like Black Sabbath of old, not 12-15 mediocre songs just to please the record labels, but 8 great songs.  The guitar riffs are true Sabbath form.  \\"End of the Beginning\\" is what it is.  It prepares you for the storm!  Geezer, Iommi, & Ozzy sound really good.  I am really impressed how this album came together.  This album gets better as I keep listening to the tunes.  This release is truly an instant classic!<br /><br />Reading some negative reviews, I really don't know what they're looking for.  I disagree with most of hate, but they're entitled to their opinions.<br /><br />Only gripe I have is I'd love Bill Ward to be a part of this album, but Brad Wilk did a great job behind the kit.<br /><br />There's nothing more to say other than it's a great album.  I didn't think they could do it, but they pulled it off.  Yet again, the four fathers of metal get it done.  Hope you enjoy the album.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I've read the books and am now a ways into the movie. Like the book the movie is set in South Carolina. I live in South Carolina and had this movie stayed in theaters longer than a weekend or two we might have had riots over the HORRIBLE accents. No one here talks like they do in this stupid movie. It's not even CLOSE to a Tennessee, Louisiana or Mississippi accent. It's a joke. Shame on you for being such crappy actors.<br />Signed, Every Southerner alive.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The puzzles are well proposed, the  graphics are as good as always. Very enjoyable puzzle game! Recommended for logical thinkers.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|StS's latest release is excellent, absolutely as good as the last two albums.  Once again, Scale the Summit prove themselves masters of both metal and melody.
B0094LU2TU|4.0|This movie has a good bit of originality to it, not just your run of the mill flick. It was also pretty entertaining, worth checking out.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is pretty cool it is pretty easy at first but gets harder further along. Definitely worth the price of free.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|typical adolescent comedy, not much subtlety here.  at least i watched the whole thing, so i guess it is not really bad bad.
B001R22TBI|5.0|Simply brilliant!  Eva Cassidy meets Norah Jones in a delivery of musical excellence. I heard the album being played in my local Old Bar cafe and was immediately drawn to the fine vocals and qurky choice of songs backed by some magic music. Apart from a brief encounter with Nine Million Bicycles (never knew who sang it) Katie Melua was an unknown to me until that sunny morning in the Little Favourites Cafe. Look out for the jazz version of Canned Heat's On The Road Again, Thankyou Stars and If You were a Sailboat are standouts. The clever Mary Pickford is an interesting history lesson on Hollywood Studio, United Artists.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.<br />I have gotten recipes, nail designs, garden ideas<br />and since I'm a teacher I have found many ideas<br />to do with my kids and have put some of my<br />ideas on there
1936608898|2.0|I had read the rave reviews on Amazon.com, so I bit the bullet and got this book. I wanted to look like the beautiful people who wrote the book, but I just can't commit to not eating grains. This book wasn't for me. I want to recommend a different title for those who would like to know more about nutrition and how to eat. [[ASIN:159463100X Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease]]is about the obesity epidemic, but the author gives solid advice for keeping your blood sugar low and eating high fiber and protein. This makes more sense to me.
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|I actually live in Cabo San Lucas Mexico were this film was made and I may show off that I was one of the archers on the walls of Troy!!! how do you like that?<br /><br />Amazing movie!!! you must have seen how long it takes to make a 20 minute scene fighting on the walls of troy. I have read the oddysee (I believe that how you write it in english), and in depicts it almost accurate!<br /><br />A must have collection movie
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have seen many reviews of people saying they didn't like how she ended the book. It kind of discouraged me, but I bought it and read it anyway. I am soo glad I didn't let their negative reviews stop me from reading it. I loved it. I think it is awesome there will be another book! I have something to look forward to!
B00D4E9BDQ|5.0|Easily one my favorite releases this year.<br />It's one of the few dance 'albums' that holds up as a singular work of art. There's enough variety to hold your attention and the production is warm and sparkly. Reminds me a bit of Rae & Christian's sublime \\"Northern Sulphuric Soul\\" from a few years back. I can't wait to see what these guys do next.
B007R0WHMK|3.0|Phenomenal cast; amazing cinematography.  But a repugnant storyline and weird main character.  He's certainly no hero; not an anti-hero, not even an unlikely hero.
0061537969|1.0|The only parts of this book I really liked were the first and last chapters. Everything in between was so incredibly depressing and morose, I don't understand why so many people like it. It was one bad thing after another. First the dog is so happy and then he hates the girlfriend (later wife), then he thinks she's sick, then there is a \\"possessed zebra,\\" then she's dying and then he can't get custody of the daughter. Spoiler alert, this is the worst book I have read in the last couple of years. It really is beyond me why this is a best-seller. It was like, every single bad thing that can happen to a single person was all crammed into one book. I didn't like it at all, and I think you should only read it if you want to be so irritated about the plot that you have to stop reading it and take a break.<br />Anyway, don't read it.
B009G41CG2|4.0|A little hard on the eyes,  and no hints, but it's a good game anyway! Try it out...for free, you can't beat it!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Facing challenges and staying focus to acheive your goal is the key to success.<br />Best movie for hope and success
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I liked it. Held my attention, I intricate puzzles,etc. I just wish it was longer. I would purchase part 2 for sure!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this is easily one of the best games on the market! It's free and the graphics are really good. I'm glad tye designers behind this app made a part two. It's very creative with new levels, challenges, and even new characters.
0979019710|5.0|I have known Hal for about 15 years now, and he is one of the most inspiring and genuine people I have ever met.  The practical and insightful information contained in The Miracle Morning has been such a great influence in my life that I have now bought and shared over 200 copies of his book with my friends, family, and clients.  Everyone has had rave reviews and loves the changes that this book has created in their lives.  Thanks Hal!<br /><br />Isaac Stegman<br />CEO- The Stegman Group
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|When the film starts with a veteran sniper randomly shoots down 5 people along Pittsburgh's waterfront,<br />I said to myself \\"Oh, no, not again!\\"  Haven't we had enough senseless killings in this world?<br /><br />This film is based on one of the books of the prolific crime writer Lee Child.<br />Christopher McQuarry mounted a nice looking film noir using Pittsburgh's unique locations.<br /><br />With Tom Cruise as a 'modified\\" Jack Reacher, the film is a good ride as far as crime film goes but with<br />a hollow center.<br />The simple story line may be able to get away with in a novel but for a film of this nature, you need much more<br />than that.<br />While watching this film, I kept on thinking of Clint Eastwood's \\"Dirty Harry\\" which this film should have been.<br /><br />That being said, Tom Cruise always delivers.<br />You can sense his commitments to this film and his energy while watching the film.<br />Rosamund Pike was given a meaty role this time and she delivered in flying colors.<br /><br />By turning the book into a film, Jack Reacher the protagonist might have lost some of his sheen, e.g. the 6 ft 5 in<br />250 plus frame drifter/crime fighter who doesn't own a car or a weapon except being handed one.<br /><br />By turning Jack Reacher as described by the author in his books into Tom Cruise, it further watered down the uniqueness<br />of this central character.<br /><br />A good ride, but not a very satisfactory one.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game, not forced to spend money in game. Does use quite a bit of battery. Not encountered any problems. Happy days
B005S9ELVC|3.0|The title of this film says it all, (police)squad vs gangsters.<br />Critically speaking, it is a Saturday matinee entertainment using the police and gangsters in the late 40's Los<br />Angeles as a springboard.<br />The film is well-mounted with a team of young actors fighting against Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen.<br />Josh Brolin as a tough cop fares the best.<br />He's the only one who acted and resembled someone from that era.<br />Ryan Grosling's acting was mannered, looked too contemporary and out of place(stop using that damn toothpick!).<br />It is an entertainment, not to be taken seriously.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I found the the book to be very entertaining. Holds the reader's attention. The negative reviews here I find to be very harsh and overly critical. It's ENTERTAINMENT not a thesis...
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Steven Soderbergh had claimed that he would pull out of movie making business.<br />In the meantime he continues to produce high standard medium budget films such<br />as this latest one.<br />To fully enjoy the film, one must not know anything about this film prior to watching it.<br />It is a Hitchcockian mystery with a relevant subject matter.<br />Steven Soderbergh directed with a seasoned hand based on a well-written script.<br />Rooney Mara gave another impressive performance as the \\"heroine\\" in distress.<br />She was ably supported by Jude Law who gave one of his recent best performances.<br />This film is about drugs, psychoanalysis, deceit, murder and revenge.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005176F|3.0|I knew I didn't know any songs from Blur other than Song 2 so I went at it with an open mind. There are a few good ones on here, but I can't say that I enjoy the whole album.
0762439009|5.0|Tried to pick out a birthday gift for my son-in-law. Then I remembered he is a huge Lebowski fan. Ordered and received this kit without any issues. He loved it!
B008Y768XO|5.0|Well cast movie, full of actors that did very well in their parts, including the dog(s) that played Hachi. I would recommend for anyone who wants to shed some tears.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I see so many applications of this information. I feel I can use it personally. I also see uses as a teacher and parent. It makes me think about my habits and how I can improve them and how to help build them in others.
B004G0SJU8|4.0|All of the actors were well cast; the music was excellent and well-timed, but it apparently did poorly in the box office. I thought it was well-directed and meg ryan is such a beautiflu lady all around.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love this game but on my kindle fire it normally says like jet pack joy ride is not responding but other wise i love it! :)

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I ended up liking this show. I can't wait for season 2. (Season 1 was like 23 episodes)
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Not being much of a Beach Boy fan, I was new to the story of the Smile project. I've owned Pet Sounds for some years, along with a mid-60's vinyl greatest hits album. Having recently seen and been inspired by the Showtime special on Brian Wilson's 2004 presentation of Smile in London, I researched and connected the dots finally to the Beach Boy's Smile Sessions album. It's a journey that was well worth the effort.<br /><br />Having listened all the way through the mono album about a dozen times now, my thoughts have come together on this tremendous work and I wanted to share them here.<br /><br />Many say this is a disjointed effort, appropriately named \\"Sessions\\" because it is an unfinished work hobbled together years later to create a product where none existed before. I can't agree with this at all - it's clear that this work had absolutely no hope of coming together in any sort of cohesive way at the time it was made. In fact, I'd say if he had more time and energy to spend, Brian Wilson would have simply expanded the frontiers even further rather than try to pull anything together. The \\"component\\" approach he took, recording 1 or 2 minute musical \\"themes\\", simply created an ever-growing set of puzzle pieces that must have seemed exponentially harder to sort out with each passing day. But with the 2004 template finally in place, at least some sort of road map could be used to sequence the whole thing, and that's how we get to the Smile Sessions album.<br /><br />The document we are left with is as authentic a \\"Smile\\" album as we could have ever hoped to have, now or in 1967. Because this is the POINT of the album - it's a kaleidoscope of sound, audio cotton candy, a comic book of colors and images.  That's the joke, that's the smile! As these changes wash over us, one after another, with impossible musicianship, singing and melody, that's what you do - you smile! Because you can't possibly be listening to what you are hearing.<br /><br />There are a few anchorsto hold onto - Heroes and Villains, Surf's Up, Cabin-Essence - these provide the glue for what is essentially a tapestry of sound excursions we encounter along the way between them. Like a ride in an amusement park where each turn is met with new images and sounds that make us gasp with delight.<br /><br />The material itself is gorgeous. There are riches, and then more riches. The closer you listen, the more you will discover. It's actually quite ridiculous how much genius shoots by, one bit after another. Brian's voice is amazing, the harmonies unbelievable, the detail of the music so fine grain and finished like so little music actually becomes. It is so compelling you cannot easily walk away from it and not take it with you. I've found myself chanting the \\"cha's\\" of \\"Father of the Man\\" in the shower, mentally replaying that wonderful sax solo at the end of \\"You Are My Sunshine\\", tapping on the dinner table the eerie percussion of \\"Fire\\", or laughing out loud at the thought of the \\"doings\\" in Cabin-Essence. I suspect this is going to go on for a while.<br /><br />I've coincidentally been listening to a lot of Guided By Voices recently, and to my ears I hear something very similar going on here. If Robert Pollard had the musical capabilities of Brian Wilson, but retained the GBV approach, what you'd get would sound a lot like Smile. A handful of mature, anchoring pieces and a collage of soundscapes tying them together. Brian Wilson was doing this almost 50 years ago now. I suspect that at the time he didn't know exactly what he WAS doing, only that he tapped into something he obsessively followed because he knew he was headed in a special direction. When you consider his fragile nature, and the tightrope he knew he was walking (consider the weight of responsibility to deliver when you don't know where the artistic trail leads), it's easy to see how doubts from his mates were enough to crush the whole thing. This was just too much to do alone.<br /><br />Fortunately the tapes survived and now it finally belongs to all of us.<br /><br />Smile is unique in rock music history - nothing else is nearly like it. Listen to Smile, then go back to Pet Sounds. As lush and beautiful as Pet Sounds is, it is missing a dimension present in Smile. A depth, a daring, a confidence in being different  - in CELEBRATING being different.<br /><br />Is Van Dyke Parks a little TOO clever at times? Absolutely (I cringe at \\"adieu or die\\" every time). And shouldn't \\"Wonderful\\" be 30 seconds longer, with a few more refrains of that beyond-poignant chorus? Of course. But in the end, these are insignificant thoughts - there is so much treasure here, I doubt I'll ever finish counting it.<br /><br />You did it, Brian. Thank you.
B0064MT1U8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever! I love it!! It has romance, comedy, drama, no real adventure or horror but I'm not into horror movies.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book reads quickly you become very involved with main character  ard to put down made for some late night reading
B000FCK65W|5.0|This was the first novel I ever read. I was eleven and had just moved from East New York, Brooklyn. I read it again at thirty and now I am sixty-two. I feel as if I read three books. The rich language and vivid setting are exquisite. I may have become a teacher because of it.  You cannot read this story and not be affected. It moves you. The saddest part is finishing it. You will want it to go on and on and on.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great story well written similar to his other book in style but different context hard to put down  you get involved with the characters
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so refreshing, funny..I like how it's from the male Point of view. Read it, it will open your eyes on how men think sometimes. I loved it.... The author did a really good job.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Once you begin, you won't want to put it down and you definitely don't want it to end! Best book I've read this year.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best series ever written. Scenery is beautiful. You will absolutely get hooked. Looking forward to Season 4.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I was listening to mark and lynda s podcast when they played an acoustic jeff lynn song and i had to find it. during the search i found this concert. being a beatles fan and georges i had to check it out. its really really good. at one point there are nine guitars on stage playing at once. thats never a bad thing. and the indian music in the beggining is very interesting and good.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I sent this item to my sister in Texas. She called me screaming because she was so happy to finally get these albums.
0525953728|5.0|Read this before you see any of the movies made. I feel like it's much better and more informative than what they show in the movies.
B0006L16N8|4.0|this item was also a gift and it was sent a bit earlier. Though it wasn't a set it was still on my sister's to 5 list
0062082353|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. I also recommend his new book American Gun. If you're thinking of buying this book, please do. You will not be disappointed.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I want more floors.  Great workout for your mind. Love the logic challenge!  It is very addictive. cant wait for more levels.
0316044695|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. You can get an autographed copy of this book and his other book Service at marcusluttrell.com<br />I also liked American Sniper and American Gun and No Easy Day. Great books from true American Heroes.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This is a nice app that works well, except that it is unable to save the edited photo, making the app completely useless.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest producers, writers, and film makers of all time. Without a doubt this movie is one of his greatest.  My only wish is that none of what happened during the Hitler era had never happened.  There is so much hate in the world.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wanted a version for my kindle and this one fit the bill. Recommend for all ages and skill levels.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Excellent movie.  My granddaughter loves it.  I thought it was pretty entertaining myself. The whole theme behind the movie, priceless.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I liked the book overall, but did some times find the lack of one clear maritime voice difficult to follow.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled does it again. A gripping tale of how so many lives can intertwine.a phenomenal book about family friends love loss & war an excellent read !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game to put on your devices. You can upgrade to different places like Miami and Easter island
B007N8RULO|5.0|After my computer-fixer friend showed me Spider Solitaire I quickly got bored with the too \\"easy\\" (all spades) version. However I soon got hooked on the \\"intermediate\\" level (spades and hearts). Now, nearly 6,000 games later, I admit I'm hopelessly addicted. When our minister recently confessed an \\"addiction\\" during a sermon...everyone sat up and paid attention. Turned out he had just kicked the habit of Spider Solitaire. (Since then he's slipped and admits to playing again.)<br /><br />I defend our addiction to Spider Solitaire because it is distracting and relaxing, and good for eye exercising, eye-hand coordination and concentration. Interestingly, it is a life lesson in karma: one has many choices each minute and each decision leads to a certain result with a chain of results to follow. Yet one can backtrack, correct errors and make different choices, take one's time, and test one's memory and logic. Then when it seems that all is lost, one can regroup and maybe even win the hand. As with the law of karma, cheating is impossible.<br /><br />Beware this enjoyable but time consuming addiction!<br />NBS
B008JFUMDS|4.0|Enjoyed movie.  I'll probably see it again.  Beginning and ending of movie are best, middle little flat.  Otherwise I enjoyed it.  Purchased soundtrack
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the best book in my opinion! They are all great, but for me this one was the best. The whole series is 5 stars!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I can't get enough of Doctor Who. David Tennant is the best Doctor. Definately a must watch. Catherine Tate is so funny.
B00B596VB2|3.0|So I just got this in, and I was super excited to continue my RG collection, only to be immediately angered by the fact that one of the elbows of the skeleton have a piece that was broken during shipping, at this point I don't know if I'm going to be able to complete the model, So great product, but I would wait until a different vendor has it in stock, Value's Japan obviously doesn't know how to handle fragile packaging
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is a good game . It's the same thing as cod b o 2.I have a good time when
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I WAS SO PLEASED THAT YOU HAD CAPTION ON THE SERIES.  THE STORY WAS INTRIGUING, COULDN'T WAIT<br />FOR NEXT EPISODE. COSTUMES-SCENERY, PHOTOGRAPHY, ALL DONE SO WELL BY BBC
B000TENKV8|5.0|I've heard snippets of Mazzy Star throughout the years but finally found out who they were so I purchased the album So Tonight That I Might See.  Perfect date music, excellent tunes to paint by and great Sunday morning melodies that can waft through the leaves as I have my coffee.<br />Just excellent music, this. I'll be purchasing more of Mazzy Star in the future
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|As I read, I can see in my mind exactly what is happening just as well as I can see it on Tv.  Great.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|How will I go through the day with these emotions coursing through me, yet no one beyond me knowing what is going on in my mind?!<br /><br />You WILL want to stay up all night to finish Wonder.<br /><br />You WILL want to carry copies in your pocket to hand out to everyone you meet.<br /><br />You WILL look at everyone differently as you move through the world.<br /><br />And you WILL offer &#34;more kindness than is necessary.&#34;<br /><br />The Natalie Merchant song has always been one of my favorites...I've sung it to my daughter for all of her 7.75 years. I won't be able to sing it without choking up for many weeks to come, but that is as it should be.<br /><br />This book will change you.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Have had a ton of fun with this app.  Tried several times to stump it.  Have only managed to do so a couple of times.  I have thought of obscure characters and it still manages to guess them every time.
1449433251|5.0|...for collectors of great newspaper comic strips. Bill Watterson has created a masterpiece with Calvin and Hobbs and didn't beat it to death. He knew his product was complete and stopped at the right time.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I thought that they could have developed the characters and remained closer to the book, especially the whole ending which did nothing to want to bring me forward to a conclusion
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had trouble putting it down.I was always looking forward to what was going to happen next kept me intrigued
B005MLOKXA|5.0|There are times, I'm sorry to admit, that we watch as many as four episodes a night--and we've never ever been TV crazy.  The show features fascinating characters, a rich core plot, and literally dozens of courtroom dramas otherwise unrelated to each other.  Each week, the writers create a story that advances the series' great concerns--whether &#34;the good wife&#34; will reconcile with her unfaithful husband--as a frame for the trial offered that week. THE GOOD WIFE is like watching a well-crafted episodic novel--wonderful characters, fascinating plots.
B00A2AU314|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies I have seen in a very long time. I greatly recommend this movie.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I have to admit that this 3rd book in the Chronicles was not as fast moving and attention holding as the first two, but with his other books, Archer has done it again. And leaves you hanging at the end of the book and wanting more. I am looking forward to the sequel.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Tesla was quirky and different, and was pushed into a corner by the more popular, but less talented Thomas Edison.  Edison pushed DC while Tesla pushed AC.  As you know, virtually everything today runs on AC.  However, Tesla didn't have powerful friends like Henry Ford and Teddy Roosevelt, like Edison, so obscurity was his lot.  Thankfully, he is finally rising to prominence, and books like this help.  He was a man half a century ahead of his time and it took time over half a century for the American public to catch up with him..
B00002MZ12|4.0|I was browsing the used CD bin at my local record store here in Cincinnati the other day and fell upon this, for literally next to nothing. As I was a huge Alanis fan around 1996 to 2004, I decided to give this a try and bought it. Glad I did.<br /><br />\\"MTV Unplugged\\" (12 tracks; 54 min.) was released in late 1999, about a year after the \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" album, which was quite a good and ambitious album that nevertheless was doomed to failure in the long shadows of the \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album. So this unplugged/acoustic album features a mix of Pill tracks and Supposed tracks, with a couple of previously unreleased songs thrown in for good measure (\\"No Pressure Over Cappuccino\\", \\"Princes Familar\\") and a well-known cover too (The Police's \\"King of Pain\\"). The Pill songs are most revealing for me, as they are now wholly-exposed, there is no hiding behind a wall of sound, and when you listen to the lyrics, it's at times chilling. It is also clear that the Pill songs are simply better than the Supposed songs.<br /><br />In all, I found this to be a welcome addition to the Alanis catalog. I caught Alanis in concert a number of times during those years and she never failed to give her all on the stage. \\"MTV Unplugged\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fas of Alanis era late-90s!
0425252868|4.0|A good yarn, just that, in places, it moves at a very slow pace.  Well researched, but perhaps too much of the research ended up in the book.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|The only problem is that it is very repetitive. Again, I have nothing against it; it's great for a free game! But it seems like the levels get randomly easier or harder! It doesn't seem like the difficulty depends on the level. Different people have different opinions on different games. I hope this review is helpful!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It's like all the rest of the \\"jewel\\" games. But, I find certain levels hard to get past as you get higher with your scores. So for me, it'd a slight challenge.  Fun and entertaining.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I avoided the Downton Abbey craze for years, but decided to give it a try. Now I'm hooked!<br /><br />I just wish season 3 was offered as part of Amazon Prime's subscription.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this Abb and use it all the time.  It has been very helpful.  Great stuff.  Great when traveling
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and I love the upgrades to different places around the world and the fact we can save our life's with keys . But what I don't like about it is it you can't really find keys or flamingos and if you do its only like 2 or 3. But my biggest problems is with the keys you can only find one key for about another billion coins !!!! Please fix that but I love the game overall thanks to whoever created it !!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm on facebook all the time and how can't you help but love this APP * with my kindle /HD * great stuff
B00499QUK2|5.0|Moffat's modern adaptation retains all the wit and charm of the stories. If Jeremy Brett is the consummate Victorian Sherlock, Cumberbatch is his brilliant heir. Freeman's wry delivery is the perfect compliment.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|Running and running. Its not that challenging but its still a great app for whenever u wanna jump some obstacles.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|These books are soooo good!!! Puts twilight to shame and I can't wait to see what they do with the movies!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Shooting and more shooting and best of all... Lasers. Love this game. Good for killing time while traveling or when u are in a boring meeting
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is a great movie- i saw it after i watched the trailer.  one that will make you cry and laugh.  i really enjoyed it.  would definitly recommend!
B0087EACJK|5.0|It gets frustrated at times which is a good thing because u feel the need to come back and play it again if u didn't pass one challenge. Great app.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|this is a cute game at first, really nice graphics and its fun building your reef and attracting fish. but about level 15 or so,  and if you aren't willing to spend your hard earned money than you stop advancing the levels. its too bad,  my nephews and nieces really enjoyed playing it,  but we're stuck now. make it a little easier and get 5 stars
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I've had the original cut the rope and i haven't had the opportunity to play with cut the rope experiment some i was so happy to download it when i saw it was the free app of the day. I love the game looks so simple and yet challenging.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was a replacement for my kindle charge cable that wasn't working.  Much better design, and can use it to hook my kindle up to my computer also.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is awesome i love playing with it. I definitely recommend it to everyone that wants to learn a little bit about dj. Sure its not the real thing but come on its a great app.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a page turner for me.  I saw a world I did not expected.  I read gone girl first (and glad I did) this was great.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great app. It takes you back to old times with arcade games. Love it and it doesn't get boring. More more more.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Sound was very good for an inexpensive turntable, but could not get sound out of my laptop when recording.  Instructions and disc seemed easy enough but did not help.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Dont let the cat catch you. Good app for whenever you feel like doing nothing and want to see a little mouse risking his life to get a piece of cheese.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game keeps me on my toes. It is an workout for the brain. I will recommend this game to my family and friends. I plan to order similar games.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I've had the free version of this app and i loved it. Luckily for me and im sure for everyone else this wonderful app was one of the free apps of the day.
B00168OIP8|5.0|I've loved this movie since it was in the theaters, and finally updated from VHS to BlueRay. It arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A friend at worked programed Pinterest into my phone. I'm loving every minute of it.  So of course I have it on every available media in my home.  I've done so many of the garden and home projects.  I cruise thru Pinterest everyday.  It feeds my creativity and  I simply can not get enough of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is full of courage, strength, passion. It's a true 'Love and War situation'  From Friends to Enemy's. A never forget book
B0063IH60K|5.0|The Solitare game is wonderful.  Now whenever I'm waiting in line or in a doctors office the time flies by.  It is so nice to have this distraction.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This season is as good as the last!  Each character keeps me wondering what will happen next - I'll be watching!
B003B02O7I|5.0|I was riveted from page one.  Mr. Grisham is a great story teller.  His characters become a part of the reader's life.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Loved the DVD and CD. Glad I pre-ordered it. They truly love what they are doing and watching it it even better than just listening.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I have fallen in love the cast.  I want to learn more and can't get enough.  Keep up the great work
B007THA4FI|1.0|Honestly, I am a HUGE fan of Joanne Rowling....this book was horrendous. Too many characters, the language is foul...please just read the harry potter series again, and forget you even heard about this book!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Becasue the title &#34;The Good Wife&#34; sort of turned me off I didn't give this series a look until late in season three.  I was quickly hooked and so watched the first season to see how the series started.  Cops, doctors, and lawyers are the standard stuff for TV shows but TGW is really a cut above most.  The legal cases are often interesting or involve interesting characters, the work-place politics are ever present, and the marital/family stress is real enough to empahize with -- overall a good recipe.  We're on to season 2 now.
B0014BECF8|5.0|I'm very happy with the CD 25. There is no other to compare to George Michael. I can hardly wait for his new CD.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|Very good reader. Very easy to highlight or underline. Bugs were corrected and I love this reader. Very useful on my study.
B00190KZUU|5.0|I have seen this movie many times.  There is always something new to find each time I view it.  The characters remind me of certain family members, real, true, honest.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|Just an enjoyable CD even if you feel like you have every essential Marley album, I highly recommend this one!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Entertaining writing and a great cast to perform it.  Eureka is a Guiness moment on the screen.  On to Cafe Diem!
B00CW665VI|2.0|It wasn't that his book was poorly written. Quite the opposite actually. I enjoyed the plot as well as the characters. However, what I didn't enjoy was the nonstop use of the &#34;f&#34; word as well as every other curse word you can think of nonstop throughout the story. Only read it because I hate to waste money, but I am not a fan of foul language and felt guilty and offended the entire time I was reading. There should be ratings on books anymore i guess similar to movies for those of us who don't enjoy all the language.
B00C2AXDAU|4.0|This is a really nice collection of songs from Kurt Vile. His vocal style probably isn't for everyone, it can seem really lazy at times. With that said he is a great musician and puts out some awesome songs.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|The quality is better than I thought possible. I really appreciate the quality because Mad Max is one of my favorite films. I have a film library and this version compliments the library. Thank you!
0385343248|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it very educational from a historical and cultural perspective.  I even picked up some Japanese while reading it.  I can't remember the the last time a read a book that was close to 1000 pages so quickly.<br />My only issue (and why I can't give it 5 stars) was that the book didn't end where I wanted it to.  I felt like the story deserved a sequel. The author tied up everything so quickly from a character perspective, but there was so much left to say about the events that happen after the last page.  I can't say more without spoiling the ending.  I CAN say that although the book centers on Blackthorne, the book is really about the Great Game played like a master by the main warlord, or Daimyo, Toronaga.<br /><br />This book is skillfully written and and an amazing work all around.
1591845556|5.0|Josh Kaufman is back with a new book on learning - The First 20 Hours. His first book, the mega-selling Personal MBA, was a brilliant approach to business and broke down massive complexities into bite size chunks for us to grasp and retain.<br /><br />Like the book before it, The First 20 Hours is a step by step deconstruction of the learning process. My favorite part is that Josh gives a lot of credit to the reader. His tone/writing style is welcoming and shows the discovery of his process as he went through it. He asserts that skill acquisition comes down to 10 major principles and 10 major effective principles of effective learning. The best part: he gets to the goods. This isn't some long book with just a few points, by chapter 4 we're into the lab of experimentation. It's like we're reading his journal of trial and error of these principles being put into place.<br /><br />I definitely think you should pick this book up, especially if you're into making your life better. It's no secret I've been in the Kaufman camp for some time and my own experience is that Josh knows his stuff. He's thoughtful, intelligent and has a track record of killer insight.
B00C061I3K|4.0|In no way am I saying this is a bad album; it is not, but the hype wagon for this was armed to the teeth, and that should not sway my opinion, but it certainly sets up the expectations that this is some epic Led Zeppelin 3 level stuff.<br /><br />That said, this is as solid as it could be, for what it is. The problem is that in some regard it reveals the limitations of the core concept behind Daft Punk. The expectation that we should take their helmets and robo-voice persona as seriously as Quincy Jones real persona, is a stretch. They have made fantasy characters out of themselves, and no matter how kick-ass the helmets are, or how sweetly they nail the vocoder parts, we are still enjoying characters rather than real people. The fact that their Tron soundtrack gig extended into cameos was the ultimate no-brainer.<br /><br />The problem with this is that they are actually extraordinarily gifted producers, who used this schtick to catapult themselves to their current level, but now cannot escape this character identity. So you say \\"what's wrong with that?\\" as if Deadmaus was not somehow the Slipknot of electro-dance. He even changes to different helmets, and they are all corny as hell. I am pleased that most listeners don't see it this way, but eventually the steam will run out on their character mask/voice concept, which this album seems to indicate the beginning of an attempt to transcend said identity. Are we to assume that they actually wear these helmets and communicate in vocoder-speak when they produced parts of the new Kanye record? Oh course not. It's just that it is limiting, compared to the ever-changing intense costumes and variety of scary vocal effects or character voices used by The Knife.<br /><br />So, now that I have dropped my Amazon ranking by being honest about my hang-ups, please note that I give this 4/5, because the identity limitations are my main problems with it, and it's not as important as the music, right? They are trying to get out of the way, by swapping out electronics for studio players, and hiring an all star cast of not just musicians but vocalists.<br /><br />When Pharell comes in, everything falls into the pocket. \\"Get Lucky\\" is an easily identifiable single, that is as close to a flawless disco jam as possible, and in many ways the best song he has been a part of since the first N.E.R.D. album. However, when they hire him for a second song, they pull a classic cheap-DJ move and attempt to stretch out a small phrase to repeat for as long as possible (IE: \\"The Return of Dr Octagon\\"). It nearly works, for a good 2 minutes or so I found myself saying \\"wow, this is repetitive, but it works\\" and then 30 seconds later, \\"I take that back\\" and start thinking I might skip this song next time.<br /><br />Paul Williams feature, contrasts the other vocals because he sounds sort of like a disco Willie Nelson. I wasn't feeling his song much at all. However, I absolutely adore the Panda Bear feature, and in fact I think it's the second strongest song, after \\"Get Lucky.\\" For the most part, when they do turn off the robot voices, remove their persona distractions, and just coast on the disco-funk mood then everything goes fine. I'm just not like going crazy as if this was a huge breakthrough for music. There is no new territory explored here, but just a strong reinforcement of disco as more of a timeless and less fleeting genre, where the modern textures are neither obnoxiously preservationist, nor a diversion from the original core sound of the genre or the group.<br /><br />Basically, these songs for me are simply a welcome addition to my Pandora/iPod shuffle (minus one or two) of indie-dance, 80's retro, vintage electro, and soul/funk. It is neither new ground, nor a huge disappointment, to any of these genres which it pays homage to. It is more-or-less what you expect it to be, nothing more and nothing less: clean, efficient, and professional; it is dance music that, for now, appears to have a somewhattimeless feeling. Maybe I will get to see them live one day, so I can appreciate the masks and character voices.timeless feeling. Maybe I will get to see them live one day, so I can appreciate the masks and character voices.
B00A537BE0|5.0|My favorite children's author!  I had this as a cassette when my girls were little and was so excited to find it digitally!  Can't wait to share it with my grandchildren!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best you can move look build spawn animals its the best people can join your world creative or survivel its the best it cost money a lot for a game but its worth it deftly.
B004NELBPC|1.0|If only the font were larger this app would be better. I have not been able to increase the font at all
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We started watching Downton Abbey during season two and are now hooked on it.  We ordered this set to see the first season and to watch season two again.  While we have not yet watched all the extras included, the programs are great and we are every pleased that we purchased it.  I would recommend it for those who want to &#34;catch up&#34; on this show.
B003E74B24|5.0|I found this to be a very interesting book. It would definitely be worth reading if you are a fan of Gordon Ramsay.
B001CN2WXM|4.0|An enjoyable detective story line. I have only reviewed one of the discs.  I would recommend this to anyone liking 1930 genre.
0812992784|3.0|After a while this book loses its pacing.  I was interested in reading about his time living under the threat of fatwa, thats there, but the book concerns a lot more about the author and his life and history than I had anticipated, or was particularly interested in.
B0029BXMAI|5.0|British humor at its best. Fantastic actors. Smartest screenplay. Sometimes it seems that these stories might be quite real after all! Absolutely must have and must watch.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|And waiting for the next one.  It was well written and kept my interest.  I tried this book on a whim and glad that I did.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|After reading this book, the first words that left my mouth were, \\"Are you kidding me???\\" The book just ended, as if the last two chapters were missing. I understand that \\"Eva and Gideon's story isn't over,\\" but I feel like this was a rip off. I need some form of closure, rather than an obscure mention of another book to follow. I'm disappointed, Ms. Day!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game! the horses are very well animated! very easy to level up an gain everything. exactly what i was looking for!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|easy to start. hard to master. hours of fun. like the simple controls but getting the balance right is not so easy. has real driving dynamics
B0063IH60K|4.0|Other than a few pop up ads this is a great game and I play it all the time.It's very entertaining and very much like a real card deck.
B00BX3KZAS|4.0|CoB is a band I've heard a few songs from here and there, most of which I thought were awesome, but after hearing Transference I decided to get this day one and I'm not disappointed.  There's not a bad song on the album.  Dead Man's Hand on You and Damaged Beyond Repair don't sound quite as good as the others on the first listen, but they may grow on me in time.  I highly recommend this for all melodic death metal fans.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|Before my kindle slow and froze, after app couldn't play any videos had to reset my kindle and start over
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I listen to this every night to help me sleep and I've yet to find an app better than this one. The binaurals are the best feature by far and with all the possible sound combinations it's definitely worth the $3!
0670014893|4.0|As usual LeCarre' comes through with another good read.  While not as exciting as some of us previous work I highly recommend this book along with all of his novels..
B005LAII8A|5.0|Liked: Very stylish direction, nice visual effects, very well done shoot-outs, very nice character development (mostly talking about Young Joe)<br /><br />Disliked: One big plot hole that if you think about it too much it may ruin the film for you, weird prosthetic make-up on Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a very poor explanation of time travel (actually there isn't one they basically say deal with it.<br /><br />Overall I really liked this film despite it's flaws and think that it's one of the best Sci-Fi films in years.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie is thought provoking and a reminder that the disabled have  sexual needs.  The writer and director took a sensitive  issue and desensitized it, if only for the length of the movie.  Superb acting.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Liked: It acknowledged the franchises past without getting carried away, every cast member was great, I;m one of those people that hate shakey cam, but it was used very well here and added to the intensity of the situations, It was quite funny in some scenes, Zachary Quinto specifically NAILED the role of Spock.<br /><br />DIsliked: While I like the humorous scenes it got a little excessive at times. That's about it.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6-year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.<br /><br />The cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the megastar) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his `boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful facelift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a `new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.<br /><br />There are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful. Grady Harp, May 13g outfits ever created.

B007HUD6OS|3.0|I've read the other Theodore Boone books, and enjoyed them. This one was my least favorite though. The subplots seemed to be disconnected and never fully developed. The ending seemed abrupt, almost as if the book was limited to a certain number of pages and there was only one page left for the conclusion. The book was still entertaining, just not the best one of the series in my opinion.

1591845556|4.0|What stands between you finally being able to sit down at the piano to accompany yourself or a group of friends--or navigating a foreign country using the native language, or any other tantalizing prize--is not the 10,000 hours of practice made famous by Malcolm Gladwell; it is, Josh Kaufman insists, a mere 20 hours of the right kind of practice: focused, thoughtful, disciplined, and orderly.<br /><br />He outlines the basic steps necessary for this kind of rapid skill acquisition in the first three chapters, then spends the rest of the book reporting on his own application of the methodology to learn six very different kinds of skills: yoga; a programming language; a non-QWERTY touch-typing system; an ancient Chinese strategy game called \\"Go\\"; the ukulele; and windsurfing. As you read through where he hit roadblocks and how he overcame them, you start to understand not only how it worked for him, but the way rapid skill acquisition might be applied to pretty much anything you might want to learn, along with the differences and special circumstances likely to occur with different types of learning situations--valuable added knowledge before investing your own time and energy on new projects.<br /><br />There is a lot of supplemental material pointed to in the book, as well, which I've not yet looked at: web pages, videos, etc. My guess is that having a digital, web-connected device handy while reading would help a great deal in bringing the lessons to life. (I will absolutely do this when/if go back and re-read the section on learning Ruby, when/if I get off my own lazy ass and decide to learn a real programming language.) But the text alone does a fantastic job of making clear the decision tree involved in settling on flavors--equipment, instruction manuals, etc.--once the general decision to take a particular hill has been made. (And again, both parenthetically and with delicious symmetry, given how programming works, the chapter on learning Ruby does a masterful job of this.)<br /><br />Full disclosure: this review is based on an advance reader's copy of the book sent by the author, who is also a personal friend. This makes reviews harder, not easier, for me to write, as I have an almost pathological need to be liked, even by strangers, and particularly hate the thought of disappointing a friend. So it is with great delight and relief that I read this author/friend's book, which I fully believe will make learning easier for many, many people for years to come.job of this.)<br /><br />Full disclosure: this review is based on an advance reader's copy of the book sent by the author, who is also a personal friend.

B009PU2KIQ|5.0|Finally, a fresh take on the blues with overtones of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Gary Clark, Jr. has as unique approach to the blues as either of the the two aforementioned artists. There just is no better way to describe him without listening to him. Understated but adventurous. Refreshingly brilliant. My best suggestion is that you just listen to his work and you will see where I am coming from.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|had the single. god is dead for a month...took awhile to grow on me.Its like two different songs in one. Listening to the album now..its the same.

030759565X|3.0|I received this as a gift.  The pictures are lovely, and I really enjoyed reading the stories about each recipe.  However, when making the recipes, I have found some of the instructions confusing.  For example, a recipe calling for dark brown sugar says to cook it until its &#34;medium amber&#34;...how is that possible when its already dark brown??  While the recipes sound really good, I am finding that I need to alter and adjust most of them.  I do think it is full of good ideas and combinations of ingredients that I would not think of, like spaghetti squash tacos, so I will keep trying the recipes.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Accurate depiction of bi-polar disorder.  Cooper and Laurence were very good.  I would strongly recommend this movie to any and all.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This show could be called the \\"sequal\\" to \\"Catch me if you can\\" where the conartist, having been imprisoned for many years offers to assist the FBI for more freedom than prison.  The basic plots of each episode is entertaining and intersting.  The overall plot for the whole season is a little too fantastic and at the very end, the event that occurs seems a little too much, but overall I really like this show and am going to watch seasons 2, 3 and 4.  The humor in it is cheesy, but enjoyable with the paranoid conspiracy theory sidekick, then later in the season the exotic theif (you'll find yourself questioning the overall plot with this character.)

B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I was drawn to this book having read A Thousand Splendid Suns as well as a review of And The Mountains Echoed. Whilst a little hard to follow and pick up again, especially after putting it down for several days, the characters re-emerged and continued to reveal both the heartbreaks of loss - country, lives, families and the joys of humanity and re-connection with family and life's memories.

B0068THAGY|4.0|I love that this film is an homage to Spielberg. There are scenes in Super 8 lifted from many of Spielberg's films, including ET,  Schindler's List, Close Encounters and others. The kids are fantastic! The scenes where the kids are filming are the best, as is the short at the end. It reminds me a little of Stand By Me. the second part of the film with the Alien is too over the top, aka Abrams, and lacks Spielberg subtle power..
075640407X|5.0|This book had me reading it for 8 hours straight one day. Think Harry Potter, The Elder Scrolls, and The Inheritance Cycle combined, but written with a skill approaching Tolkien's.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|How can you go wrong with Julie Andrews?  And who would think that Christopher Plummer would grow up to be such a handsome dude starring in movies such as &#34;Must Love Dogs?&#34; Lovers of musicals should have this as part of their collection.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Disappointed on my levels....the story dragged, the sex scenes not nearly as intriguing; actually found it hard to finish. When I did it was just cut off in the middle, no conclusions to any of the story lines created. You wont get my $$ for books 4 and 5, nor will I but your other books. Pity I thought the first two in the seria were great.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this installment. Thank you, Mr. Martin.<br /><br />Having been a fan of this series for well over a decade, I can honestly say Dance did not disappoint. I put off reading this one because long format fantasy has lost its hold in my busy life-- I've begun to prefer shorter genres. Nevertheless, Dance plunged me back into GRRM's world, themes, characters, and compelled me to come back to the book day after day.<br /><br />I find I have become picky in my writng tastes of late. There is quality writing in this series, from the sentences to the storytelling. It is a joy to read. This is still true with Dance.<br /><br />I found Dance to move the story forward in some large ways. The backstory was significant and appreciated by this reader. For anyone who came out of Feast feeling discouraged or lost, I would suggest pursuing some of the online forums or rereading the books. Attention to detail pays back in satisfying dividends.
0486278077|5.0|Eight days have passed since I finished reading Dorian Gray but I can't stop mentioning it or going back to it's postulates. This book told me the only sin in the world is ennui, it told me that women get remarried because they detested their first husband while men remarry because they loved their first wife, conscience makes egotists of us all...<br /><br />I have read a dozen books this year including some classics like Anna Kareneina, Crimce and Punishment, The Idiot --- have sifted through some great fiction like Gone Girl, Girl who kicked hornets nest, Extremely Loud and Incredibly close, some others but no book comes close to the effect The Picture of Dorian Gray seems to have had.<br /><br />Through the cynical and might assuming Lord Henry, the author delivers sermons and wise cracks at the world. He talks about almost everything and when you finish reading a quote, you think how true, oh how true.<br /><br />I am to believe Oscar Wilde wrote just one novel and this one was it. This is a riveting effort that will delight your senses, your intellect and most of us all make you want more.<br /><br />I have a list of quotes from the book, the sense of humor is quite apt.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is not at all preachy. Its very strength lies in the finity of the characters and the infinity of their words.<br /><br />My first crack at English literature and boom.<br /><br />May I request you to leave a book recommendation in the comments for i really loved this book.<br /><br />Thanks

B0067EKYS6|5.0|The thing about Great Gatsby is that it surprised me from the very get go. The story is being narrated by a gentleman played by Toby Maguire. He is refreshing, earnest and his voice over the sequences seems to have a transient effect. The movie begins with him talking about Gatsby, there are many sets in the film and the 3D is certainly rewarding. I found that despite the limited storyline the film is poised very well, the sets are fabulous, the acting is consistently good, the humor is good, while the music is great.<br /><br />I have not liked a Leonardo Di Caprio film since The Departed. He does these agonizing roles just to prove a point to himself but he is perfectly suited to do a role such as Gatsby.<br /><br />I haven't seen this good a film since i saw the place beyond the pines earlier this year. This is tied for the film of the year spot with that film.<br /><br />Strengths are great acting, wonderful sets, very fast paced and intriguing direction, gripping storytelling and an overall feeling of sufficient intrigue and euphoria.<br /><br />Would I change anything about Gatsby? No.<br /><br />Was the end good? No, it was amazing.

Several times I ordered coins or Dollars and the app did not give me the coins or the dollars and I was still charged for them.  I also wished you could play the entire game again once you have finished the whole circu and prize winning.  I would like to have a time  of solution recorded to see if I could better my results.  I still would recommend this game and I think most gamers will enjoy it.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Another not great ending to a long and storied franchise.  Hopefully Martin will take note with his Song of Ice and Fire.  Minor spoilers follow.<br /><br />The books written after Jordan's death were clearly of a lesser quality.  However, the previous two were still interesting and exciting in their own ways.  Memory of Light does not measure up.  The scenes are choppy and overly long, the characters are wooden and lacking most of their charm and the world just seems grey.  I suspect the intent was to create a sense of the end, a dulling of vibrancy if you will.  This book mostly felt like an extended scene of the Iliad.  Someone killing or being killed by a Trolloc in some gruesome way.  I suspect more than half this book is devoted to battle scenes, it's too bloody much and made for a slog through reading rivaling any of Jordan's previous verboseness.<br /><br />The death of major characters was, several times, handled woodenly.  I've followed these characters for over a dozen books, I should care more when they die.<br /><br />Rand's battle with Shai'tan was extremely anticlimatic and mostly uninteresting.  It did not feel like the focus of the book, much less the series.<br /><br />There are positives of course.  I don't expect a better ending could have been written absent Jordan, it was quite a labor of love.  Sanderson does his best to finish strong but the lack of notes shows more in this ending.  However, the actual plot is solid and interesting and I feel like this is an admirable conclusion to the series.  The best that could be had at least.

B00B9366VO|4.0|Stevie Nicks, Paul McCarney, Neil Young, Rick Springfield, Tom Petty, What more needs to be said? This is a story of musicians who cared.  Audio Technicians who cared.  Not like these formulated digital money machine bands of today.  This is Analog.  This movie is about full real sound.  Real to reel or should I say real on the tape reel.  What you hear is what was done live in the studio.  In todays studios you have harmonic correctors that correct vocals.  Now is the time for William Shatner should make a recording.  They could make him sound as good as the likes Elvis Presley, Freddy Mercury or Mario Lanza.  They even correct instruments out of tune or speed it up without changing the pitch.  Now a five year old beginner can be made to sound like Zakk Wylde.  In the time of tape the musician had to retake if they made an error.  Either you got it or you don't got it.  Its true with multi track tape (Thanks to Les Paul) it would only be one instrument that would have to be done over.  But that track had to be done over. and over until it was done to the producers liking.  In other words.  Correctly.

1400052181|5.0|\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" by Rebecca Skloot<br />Rebecca Skloot, who authored the book, \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\", was inspired to write the story of Henrietta Lacks, a woman whom she learned about in a freshman high school biology class.  The story gripped her and made her wonder how Henrietta would feel knowing that her cells `helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, [and] in vitro fertilization' (Skloot, 2013).  Rebecca's main goal in writing this book about Henrietta's life was to give the HeLa cells a name.  Skloot sheds light on the circumstances surrounding the cells and how the family was unaware of the HeLa cells and their contribution to the medical community.<br />Rebecca spent countless hours researching, interviewing and studying the life and family surrounding Mrs. Henrietta Lacks.  Mrs. Lacks was a black woman living in the 1950's, who had ovarian cancer.  While undergoing surgery her cells were taken without her permission.  The HeLa cells are still alive today.  What was really interesting about this book was how Rebecca Skloot stayed true to the ethnicity and realistic view of the family and the life that Henrietta lived from the beginning when she got her initial diagnosis of cancer.  Skloot stresses the fact that `this is a nonfiction book...no names have been changed...dialogue appears in the native dialect' (Skloot, 2010).  This gives it a very authentic feel.  The reader is able to hear the way people spoke in Clover, Alabama, using slang and mispronouncing words.  The first part of the book, titled \\"Life\\", provides background detail on all of the major players in the book.  Details are given about everything from Henrietta and Day's upbringing to Dr. Gey, the researcher who would eagerly await testing samples and occupied a small space in the basement of Johns Hopkins Hospital.  Dr. Gey's miniscule budget relied on samples taken from patientsunder an agreement reached with the attending doctor.  He and his wife, Mary built the makeshift lab which ran tests on multiple cell samples which all died except the HeLa cells.<br />Part two of the book, which is titled \\"Death\\" recounts the death of Henrietta and the story surrounding her cells and what happened to them.  The documented conversations that Rebecca Skloot had with the family, showed how the family was left behind to answer questions which they could not answer.<br />Part three is the immortality of the HeLa cells and how they went on to being a part of just about every lab around the world.  They can be attributed to finding numerous medical cures and countless hours of research.<br />This is a well written book which has received countless awards such as: `2010 Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Nonfiction, the 2010 Wellcome Trust Book Prize, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Award for Excellence in Science Writing, the 2011 Audie Award for Best Non-Fiction Audiobook, and a Medical Journalists' Association Open Book Award, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was featured on over 60 critics' best of the year lists' (Skloot, 2013).<br /><br />Works Cited:<br />Skloot, R.

Her writing is concise; she gets to the point quickly and is easy to understand. Her writing is also very human, sensitive, and fun. She is positive, encouraging and motivating. She inspired me to experiment with some new ideas. No matter how much you think you already know, if you are very sure you are as healthy as can be, you will still enjoy this book, and you may learn something new. If you don't already know it all and are looking for some practical advice on being healthier, you will find it here.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I'm shocked at the reviews on this movie.  It is one of those very rare movies that I can watch over and over.  Making a movie that is a prequel to a 70+ year old classic is no small job and I believe this film was wonderfully made, exciting to watch and held true to important parts of the original classic.  Compared to the majority of movies that are cranked out today it is a great, family friendly film.  I've seen it in the theaters several times, on a Disney cruise ship and am looking forward to owning my own copy.  Don't let the reviews fool you, if you have seen the original you must see this movie.

B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as she really loved it.  It is a moving, realistic movie.  We can never know the terror of this kind of event unless we have lived it.  This movie is well done and well acted.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|No instructions on how to use.  I am an elderly woman and I'm not up on all the new ideas.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I saw this movie and had to buy it.  Kudos to Ben for making this movie.  It is a different story than the American public has been told.  If it is true, we have been told lies for some time.  I can't imagine Ben would fabricate such a thing.  Either way, it is worth watching.

0812550706|5.0|I don't usually go for science fiction but with this series I couldn't put the books down. I ended up ordering the whole series because I really wanted to know what happened to the characters. I have 2 more books to go in the series and I'm hoping to find out what happened to Bean, Petra and thier kids by the end of it, but I don't think any of the books are going to cover it!!!
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I bought this for my mom's kindle Fire and she loves it.  The leather is great quality and it provides adequate protection for an adult.  I've used her Kindle and my only complaint would be the cover didn't close all the way (lay flat) in the beginning but it seems to be laying more flat as the leather wears in.

0385349947|4.0|It was great to read about successful and happy women. Wonderful for men and women to read. Women and men need to understand that being a successful woman in business and have children means that men have to lean in and help with the children. Women should not be expected to do it all. People need to quit judging smart successful women.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Wish I had this App years ago. It is one of the best set up tools I've seen for WiFi in your home.  Easy to use, and very responsive to find the hot and cold spots around your home WiFi Router.  It really helps you understand why some wireless devices don't work so well in certain places.  Has to be one of the best Free Apps out there related to WiFi use.
030758836X|5.0|The story is well written and has lots of twists and turns in it. At times it was really hard to put down. My husband and I both enjoyed it immensely. Lets all hope that we never have to live with an &#34;Amazing Amy&#34; !!!

0307352153|1.0|I was disappointed and lost interest half way through the book as the author went off on too many tangents.  I love the subject but I lost interest due to the way it was written...

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really liked this book.  I reviewed it over on goodreads and felt compelled to post here as well simply because I want more people to read this series.  I loved the world, the pacing, and the characters.  It reminded me a bit of the Farseer trilogy by Robin Hobb at times and the Kingkiller Chronicles in setup and narration.  There are some editing issues, but they're not as bad as some people have made them out to be.  I found I could ignore them and pay attention to the story.  I think this a great series and I really want the author to continue.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|First try at Reacher novels, liked it a great deal, finished it on a delayed flight from Phoenix.  Interesting character design albeit unlikely.

B005CRQ2IU|5.0|One of the best graphic novels and read. I have the original comics and got this when it popped on kindle sale. Couldn't turn down a cheap digital version of one of the best!
B00B19DW0E|4.0|How cheesy do you have to be?  Well, if you're John Carpenter, about five slices above muenster.  First, you take your classic 80's tropes:  dystopianism and 'futuretech' and then you throw in Kurt Russel to chew up some scenery, give it the barest bones of a plot, layer it all with analogue synth drones, and throw in Isaac Hayes for good measure.  Stir it up, film it, and let it rock!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|It is a Gabaldon. Of course it was a good book. I love historical fiction. I felt like I had traveled back in time myself.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book was very confusing and a very slow read. I guess because I didn't understand as well as more younger adults would. I'm a teenager. The book got really good toward the end. I'm disappointed kinda, it's not as good as I hoped it would be. But overall I'm happy I read it. It gave me a different outlook on life. :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this entire series.  The first book kept me wanting more of the story so I read this book and it got even better.  I highly recommend the whole trilogy!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've noticed that I have to watch the clock or too much time flashes by. My grandchildren love to play it and when we are in the car it gives themselves something to share and do to make time pass.

B001DUDKEY|5.0|Persuasion is possibly my favorite Jane Austen novel, with its story of love triumphing over bad choices and inhospitable surroundings. I've read the book several times and still cheer for Anne as she slowly overcomes her family and reaches out to her one true love.<br /><br />This is not a story that gets adapted for the big or little screen very often. It's a rambling story with no one central location and a lot of subplots that make up the tapestry of the story. The heroine is so virtuous she's almost too good to be true, and yet she has to be engaging and clearly wounded by life or you won't want to follow her for the whole story. And -- most important, I think -- it's almost impossible to capture the romantic lead, Captain Wentworth, onscreen. He's a bit of an enigma throughout Austen's novel, but he has to motivate the entire story. Producing Persuasion on screen is just as challenging, in it way, as producing Jane Eyre -- most of the Jane Eyre adaptations out there just don't capture Rochester, and without Rochester there is no story.<br /><br />This 1994 BBC production of Persuasion hits it out of the park on all these fronts. Most obviously, Ciaran Hinds IS Wentworth, injured by love but a dynamic, powerful man. Through his sheer physical presence, subtle acting and the spot-on dialog he's given (most of it lifted directly from the book), he's completely believable as a man tormented by an old love rekindled, but also he's no wilting Romantic poet -- this is a man you could see commanding a ship of the line, a man who is rising through the naval hierarchy like a rocket, the James T. Kirk of the early 19th century.<br /><br />Anne Elliot, as played by Amanda Root, is a similarly successful character. She's a wounded bird, large-eyed and wasting away, but through the writing of her dialog (again, mostly lifted intact from the book) and the sweet, engaging performance, she's immensely likeable and also (very important) believable as a woman of her time. Very slowly over the course of the movie, she blossoms into a beautiful, strong person not afraid to step out of the long shadow cast by her family.<br /><br />And finally, the writing of this adaptation is wonderful. Somehow, the whole complicated story gets tucked up into a few hours, and yes there are some events omitted or streamlined, but none of the subplots are lost, the secondary characters are three-dimensional and true to the period, and it's all done at a liesurely pace that is true to Austen.<br /><br />So, all in all -- if you're a fan of Austen and especially her novel Persuasion, this is the movie for you. It's a wonderful cozy few hours of romance and redemption.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Loved the movie. Have actually seen it 5 times over the yrs.  Watched this with my 14 yr old son.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|This is probably one of Audrey Hepburn's best acting performances & I think all of her movies are great. very good & entertaining story.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The remastered episodes have excellent picture and sound quality. The theme song is WAY louder than the show, but other than the theme song being much louder, the sound is a consistent level - no sudden loudness.
B00BL0MGB4|5.0|The perfect accompaniment to The Colon Ring. Really leaves you with a satisfying sense of fullness. I would recommend it to anyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this app u need to get it this app is good im 11 and my friends 10 play it so does my 7 year old sis.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Overall, great show.  Great selection of songs and the sound is tight even though KK is no longer with them.  The new guitarrist kid seems to fill in pretty good, but he has a long way to catch up with Tipton's and KK's playing.  He needs to concentrate more on the music and 'delivering the goods', rather than the looks and the trying to look cool on stage with the old masters.  I have one little complaint as well, Scott Travis looks like he's going to a 9 to 5 job nowadays.  He seems bored and disengaged while playing.  Altough he keeps up well.  Looks like his heart is not entirely in the love of playing anymore; unlike Glenn, Rob, and Ian who after 40 years of Rocking they still enjoy being on stage, and enjoy giving their fans what they like.  Other than the visuals, 5 stars for the quality of the music.  The sound, the end result is what matters in the end.  Thank you JP for putting out this on DVD.  It was a pleasure to hear some of the early stuff from the 70's albums, very well executed. A true treat to your fans.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|One of my all-time favorites and such a classic, no matter how old it is, I could still watch again and again.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I grew up with the original trilogy, and adding the Blu-ray collection was a no-brainer.  Picked it up as a deal of the day at a price that you can't resist for 4 movies plus the special features.  Obviously these are enhanced versions to HD, and not as good as native modern movies.  But you can tell that they have better resolution that the DVDs.
B000Q7B8FS|5.0|great movie and i would personal recommend it to any one no mater the type of movies they like.<br /><br />worth the 10$
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Although many are still arguing if the new Star Trek movies are arguing, I enjoy them and enjoy the music just as much.  Great music from Into Darkness.  Long the piano London Calling track.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|cool movie, nice twist on the living dead movies we know and love. It is worth watching I'm sure you will enjoy.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|it needs more stuff to do like the smurfs like gardens and what not. and you need to be able to expand to other places
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie. It was fun to watch, Good action, blood and guts movie. It should keep you entertained.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|well I was,Eaton poppeys when I saw a notice saying would you life to purchase temple run 2 so I downloaded it I was so surprised. the graphics are amazing I love it No one can tell me this game is not worth purchase.
B001QFZADA|4.0|When a friend suggested I read it, I thought it would be a re-hash of religious concepts that I had heard so many times before- but it's not. There is sound psychology here to improve relationships. If you are religious, there are religious and spiritual elements in the discussion. But understanding the behavioral and psychological dimensions of human desire to love and be loved and using these 5 basic patterns seems like wise advise. For those of us that may have grown up in somewhat dysfunctional families or with one or more parents that was unable to emote, this is book provides ways to heal. it may be particularly helpful for people who have the same repeated relationship failures. The case stories are helpful at first, but got a little repetitive by the end of the book. I would still recommend reading this book- for help with personal relationships and even with co-workers and for single parents with their children.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|its so awesome you and your best friend for life has to play it. I'ts very cool I'm kiddind its a bad game
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I must say that I have been looking forward to this book with some impatience. And it fulfilled all of my expectations and even went beyond that.<br /><br />Fantastic story - both the romance and the more thriller-like aspect. Nalini Singh really knows how to keep the tension up until the last page. One of my favourites in the series, definitely.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This is a kidnapping movie with lots of action. Didn't know Liam Neeson had it in him, but he is slim, trim, and has all the action moves. Those more savvy than I will tell you about the director, actors, and plot. All I know is that I enjoyed it, and enjoyed Taken 2 also. The movie reveals what Muslims are really doing in the present world. They are real villains. I only had to suspend disbelief a few times, as when Liam manages to kill large groups of the villains; but then so does Bruce Willis. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that I reserve 5 for movies like Avatar, Back to the Future, and the original first three Star Wars movies. If you enjoyed Liam Neeson in The Grey, which I would give a 5, you will enjoy Taken. Forget all the fancy analysis and just see the movie. I liked it.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|The movie was a fun popcorn flick, but it lacked heart and humor. Once he was Captain America, their wasn't building sense of action.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|having been a fan of dungeon hunter 3 this game is an great improvement for the most part. I particularly enjoy the free roam feel even if the game is quite linear. I am definitely pleased that certain glitches from the previous installment such as foes not appearing thus causing a mission to fail was vexing. The graphics also seem to be sharper and the addition of a story line is a wonderful improvement.  Another feature i enjoy is the charm slots allowing one to customize your weapons i will say that the random nature of slots on items is annoying id much rather be able to choose the type of slot also the fact that charms become increasingly almost expodentailly more costly to not only merge compared to their sell value as well as the fact the higher level charm the more expensive it is to remove detracts from the customization addition. Now onto my gripes. By far my biggest is having to pay gems for health potions granted for those like me who strive not to use them its no big deal save there are times when the controls malifuction and before u know it your hitting the attack button and its causing your potions to be used and once used it keeps trying to buy them thankfully i have brought any gems and i know if i had and they been spent because of the glitch i would be very unhappy.  My only other gripe is i wish the game had more levels and a larger varity of foes i see really no new enemies save bosses the from previous installment other then the corrupted fallen soldiers and commons<br /> abbots and mages are just like the spell casters  from dungeon hunter 3. If the issues could be fixed id give the game a perfect score.<br /><br />.

B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|Maria Callas was the supreme Norma of the last century. She interpreted Norma in a manner that was more consistent with the traditions of Bel Canto than had hitherto been done in the Twentieth Century. However, she was still a child of her time which meant that even though she approached the part with a keen appreciation for the principles of a much older generation, she was nevertheless influenced by more recent musical movements such as Verismo. In addition her supporting casts were often even less attuned to the Bel Canto traditions thus resulting in performances which while often supremely effective did not exactly replicate the sound-world of the time of the opera's composition. To further complicate matters her conductors... and this includes the venerable Tullio Serafin... most often took a more grandiose (and not to mention cut) version of the score. While the performances were effective given their timeframe, they most likely did not represent something that Bellini would have readily recognized.<br /><br />The first attempt at introducing some corrective measures to this approach occurred with the appearance of the first of Joan Sutherland's two recordings under the baton of her husband Richard Bonynge. For the first time a lighter and more lyrical approach was taken... an approach that attempted to bypass and ignore the traditions propagated by Serafin and other older maestros. In short, Bonynge's version was the first attempt to perform the opera in a early Nineteenth Century manner with a respect for the piece's Rossinian pedigree. Cuts were opened, cabaletta repeats were embellished, and even some textual variations based on Bellini's original autograph score were introduced.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there was never much of a follow through by succeeding conductors who continued to follow the older approaches. Still, while it was eventually recognized that the role of Adalgisa should properly be assigned to a lighter soprano as would befit her younger and more virginal character... a darker mezzo was still most often assigned to the part. In fairness it should be mentioned that Ricardo Muti performed and recorded the piece in a critical edition as prepared by Haydn scholar H.C. Robbins Landon. However, aside from using a lighter soprano Adalgisa and eschewing cuts Muti's conducting did not deviate much from tradition, nor did Robbins Landon's edition deviate much from the traditional score as published by Ricordi... Yes, there were differences, but nothing that the casual listener would find too glaring. In contrast, the edition by Maurizio Biondi and Riccardo Minasi as realized in this recording by conductor Giovanni Antonini will cause some eyebrows to be raised... and even if some of the variants can be heard in both of Joan Sutherland's recordings under Bonynge... such as the extended version of the first act Norma/Adalgisa duet and the inclusion of Adalgisa's strophe in the succeeding trio.<br /><br />Now to the recording at hand, where the ultimate attempt is made to return us to the sound-world of a much earlier time and place. In fact this recording represents such a shock factor that I can only accurately describe it by making an analogy. Imagine that you were only familiar with Handel's Water Music from the archaic and bloated Hamilton Harty transcription and were then suddenly faced with the lean and mean original instrument version as recorded by Nickolaus Harnoncourt and Concentus Musicus Wien!!!!! A shock factor indeed!!! Such is the impact of this recording!<br /><br />First, not only are original instruments from Bellini's time employed, but the tempi chosen are much faster than on any previous recording of this piece. Attacks are also precise and often vicious in their approach... hammer blows of sound... no make that \\"colpi di canone\\"... explosive cannon shots of sound bolting throughout the orchestra.<br /><br />In general the voices are much lighter than tradition would dictate... and again as based on the piece's Rossinian pedigree. All the singers chosen have a number of Rossini operas in their respective repertories. Cecilia Bartoli first broke into the scene as a Rossini mezzo and then graduated to a number of soprano roles over time. She approaches the part in a lighter yet dramatic manner and since she has a darker sound than her Adalgisa is able to sound more imposing and authoritarian as a result. Still if this were the good old days her Norma would have been blown right off the stage by the likes of mezzo Giulietta Simionato as Adalgisa. However, with lyric soprano Sumi Jo as the younger priestess the voices are in perfect proportion and blend mellifluously in their two extended duets. Tenor John Osborn has made a career of Rossinian and Bel Canto roles and his lighter approach is in stark contrast to the likes of Franco Corelli and Mario DelMonaco both of whom often partnered Callas. Somehow a loud boisterous tenor works in the role, and can be considered a guilty pleasure, but they are emphatically not anything that Bellini would have recognized. Those used to a more hefty sound will think that Osborne's pleasant lyric tenor voice sounds feeble in comparison, but that is part of the point of this recording... Bass Michele Pertusi has also made a career singing Rossini. However, while he does quite well he is less steady of voice at this late stage of his career... Basses on earlier recordings have given us a more buttery tone.<br /><br />So we have a recording that attempts to transform us back in time. It is effective and informative in its own way. Any lover of the opera and/or Bel Canto ago must hear this recording if only for the many interesting vocal embellishments (not even Sutherland embroidered the second verse of \\"Casta diva\\") and textual variations. Indeed, the trio that ends the first act is totally different from any recording or performance I have ever heard. I do recall seeing something similar to this alternative version in an old vocal score many years ago... and had almost forgotten that it existed. In addition the \\"Guerra\\" Chorus in the second act is quite different as well. Some of the differences in this Chorus are heard in Sutherland's second recording, some but not all.<br /><br />In summary, I feel that many of the interpretive decisions made on this recording were done for their shock factor as opposed to musical decisions. I am not totally convinced by some of the fast tempi... yet there is much to enjoy and the sound of the old instruments confirms that Bellini was a better orchestrator than he is given credit for.<br /><br />Still my two favorite commercially recorded studio versions are Callas' second recording (Damn! In spite of the vocal problems at this late stage in her career the woman simply WAS Norma!) and Sutherland's first recording. Both give diametrically opposed versions of the score that are based on sound musical and interpretive considerations. The former as conducted by Serafin gives a large scale yet noble vision of the score. With the latter we get an earlier attempt to return to the musical world of Bellini's time by utilizing more lyrical voices supported by a less imposing orchestral palette. The recording featuring Montserrat Caballe is also worthy of consideration as she was the third of the great triumvirate of Normas of the past century preserved in sound. My overall desert island recording is the live 1955 La Scala recording with Callas, Simionato, and Del Monaco. There was nobody like Callas in the role of Norma and here she is at the absolute peak of her powers... the perfect balance of vocal perfection and dramatic insights. The performance might sound strange to 1831 ears... but it sounds vocally and dramatically convincing to these ears... With time perhaps the recording at hand will grow into my ears... and something tells me that with repeated hearing it just might do so!<br /><br />Finally, a word about the sound quality which enhances the vivid effects of the original instruments and a caveat regarding the packaging.  The CDs are encased in an attractive book-like case with extensive essays.  However, this makes the discs almost impossible to remove from the case.  Once removed I would advise storing them in a separate slim-line double CD case if you want to easily and conveniently listen to them in the future.old vocal score many years ago... and had almost forgotten that it existed.

193700788X|5.0|It was a nice way to end the story, but I do wish there was more ! Way better than the  TV series.
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|the music is fantastic, you have to dance to it; and his love for his new wife shines through everywhere...it's even better if you are watching him perform it...again, the music is so wonderful.  Yay!!
B005PK1G76|4.0|I bought this organiser recently and so far so good. The only thing is - it had strong smell, so I had to leave it to air for a couple of days.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book!  Can't wait to read more about Gideon and Eva's life together.  There is much you learn about Gideon and his past that keeps you reading.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I found this series to be a warm fuzzy, but then I'm a fan of the British Period Pieces.  Enjoyable characters, comical story lines in just the right places, adequate acting.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Another great film by Quentin - great action, acting, casting - wonderful film. I rented this for my KINDLE - can't wait to watch it again on my big TV.
B008I43DYU|1.0|Just for grins I tried 900/2.67  Answer is 3.370787e2? Not on my planet. Whole numbers it can divide, decimal, not so much.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|Not much to add to already glowing reviews except to say I'm in total agreement this is one of the more outstanding of the many productions from Pat Metheney. Have been a fan of his for many years. Excellent band. Love Chris Potter and the drummer here is really exceptional.
B004742Y68|5.0|Look up critic sites regarding the movie review itself. This is one movie worth seeing in HD. The kids will be scared but not absolutely, with the crazy stuff out now. Actually a wonderful movie about family, not a family movie per se. Streams just fine with right high-speed connection (we used wifi on our blu-ray player).
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|so in the strangest review yet....i just wanted to take time out to send a message to ozzy,tony,geezer,and brad. THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!!!!!!!! (and brad wilk did a HELL of a job, don't let anyone tell you different. as far as bill goes...it is what it is). I would give this record five stars but......IT DESERVES 13!!HAHAHAHAHAHAHA (insert ozzy's evil laughter here....)
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I love all the Die Hard movies and even Bruce Willis but this thing sucks! And its not the kids fault. There is just a stunning lack of chemistry and a poor script.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Compared to several of the other path choosing games this one seems a lot better balanced and a lot of fun. The difficulty curve feels right as the level progresses you feel that it gets a lot more intense.<br /><br />It's also better weighted than many of the games in that not every little bump pits you out of the game. Instead if you just clip an object the game puts the security guard right behind your charachter.
B0028OF7TA|5.0|THERE'S WAS NOTHING I DISLIKED, I LOVE IT. I MEAN I'M A MJ FAN AND I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. :-D
B0063GORYU|4.0|Once I get into the game it seems that I need play more than  one and next thing  I know I've spent quite a bit of time  playing it.
B00D3V85FA|4.0|I had low expectations when I heard they were coming out with a new album. I was not a fan when Ozzy went solo. Then came the reality TV show and the pointless \\"Ask Dr. Ozzy\\" column in Rolling Stone magazine. I was also disapointed they couldn't work things out with Bill Ward. \\"13\\" doesn't top my favorite album \\"Sabotage\\" but I really like it. Ozzy sounds dark and serious like he used to rather than like the cartoon character he became. Tony Iommie is in top form considering what he's going through. The riffs are there! Geezer Butler sounds great on bass and I like the lyrics. Brad Wilk is a tighter drummer than Bill Ward but he seems to fit right in. The recording mix is fine. It doesn't grab me by the throat like \\"Sabatoge\\" does but I am not disappointed. The extra tracks on the deluxe version are definetly worth it in my opinion.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have really enjoyed this app for playing with the grandkids across the miles!  Simple, relaxing fun for the whole family.
B000I186FW|5.0|It was a great movie when it first came out and it is even more relevant in today's political climate.
B001U3ZMHW|5.0|purchased for sons 9th birthday. arrived on time and in store shelf condition. very happy with purchase.  He is very happy with the numerous minifigures included in kit.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Ms. Adichie has finessed a notable achievemnt, crafting a work whose significant depth probes both class and racial attitudes and realities. I recommend this book without qualification but especially to those open to challenging crippling stereotypes regarding color and culture.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Yes I get pop ups but it's free.  They have to pay for it some way. I've purchased other similarities games without the pop ups but to me. I just play this to pass time.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|I knew of Hayley Williams and her connection to Paramore due to her vocals in B.o.B's song Airplanes, but I had never listened to her main band's music before. After seeing Brand New Eyes go on sale for $5 I decided to give them a listen.<br /><br />This was the first Paramore album I bought and listened to. I don't know how Brand New Eyes sounds compared to their previous work, but this album is simply fantastic. Almost every song on the album is full of energy and managed to become catchy as heck to me. I'll break my opinion down by song:<br /><br />Careful - An excellent lead-in, and one of the more catchy songs on the album. Hayley puts in a wide variety of emotions into the vocals in this one: powerful, desperate, aggressive to name a few, and the end result is amazing! 5/5<br /><br />Ignorance - The biggest \\"in your face\\" song on the album, full of anger and sarcasm...and I love it! One of the defining songs on this album. 5/5<br /><br />Playing God - Sounds calmer compared to the previous songs, but filled with lots of sharp lyrics like Ignorance is. The last quarter of the song is the best in my opinion. 4/5<br /><br />Brick By Boring Brick - Interesting lyrics, and a great-sounding chorus. 4/5<br /><br />Turn It Off - Decent song, doesn't stand out as much as the previous songs. I love the instrumental ending though. 4/5<br /><br />The Only Exception - The first slow song on the album, a bit repetitive but it sounds great overall. I can see why this is a popular song for them in general. 4/5<br /><br />Feeling Sorry - This song picks up the pace after the previous one, and it sounds more mature compared to the other faster-paced songs on the album, and it sports some intriguing lyrics. 4/5<br /><br />Looking Up - VERY catchy song, particularly the chorus. It's got milder lyrics that lack accusation and anger, which is a good change from the rest of the album. Love it! 5/5<br /><br />Where The Lines Overlap - A happier song lyrics-wise. Not the biggest fan of the chorus, but the immaturity of the song plays more to its strengths than its weaknesses. 4/5<br /><br />Misguided Ghosts - An acoustic, slow song. It's not very expected after listening to the rest of the album, and I think that hurts it more than anything else. Seems like something they just threw on at the end to add album content. 3/5<br /><br />All I Wanted - This song just screams 'desperation' to me, with frequent repetition of \\"all I wanted was you.\\" Not one of my favorites but not a terrible song either. 3.5/5<br /><br />Overall I give Brand New Eyes 4/5 stars. The energy felt from the stronger songs more than drowns out the weaker ones, the latter of which is hard to find on the album. Looking forward to buying more Paramore albums if and when they go on sale.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|This was not the best by any means. It was unfortunate, because from the previews, it should have been great. I guess they hold true to Hollywood standards with this one... All the good parts in the trailers!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't buy that many game apps for my kids because I want them to spend time doing other things, but this one seems to be helpful in terms of encouraging design, building, and creativity as far as video games go.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|This set of games is kind of flat.  Sure it might help 'brain training' but the games are so so.  The graphics in most are pretty lifeless.  Some of the games are like looking at a page in a text only quiz book.  There is a sudoku if you like that.  There's a matching game with unattractive drawings to match, not even as good as most free clip art.  There are 3 or 4 dozen games but more than half I really dislike.  There are a few that kept my interest, but how to I explain this--I'm kind of disappointed.  Games like this make me wish I had sprung for an Ipad instead of a Kindle Fire.
B00821PCJS|4.0|You might want to compare this series with V, and in many ways they are alike, with aliens coming to Earth with plans of conquest and subjugation. But on V the aliens were subtle and sneaky, on Falling Skies they came raining fire and they didn't prentend to be anything other than what they were, bad guys.<br />This is the first truly original scifi series I've seen in a very long time. A drama about the struggles of freedom fighters battling the alines and their daily struggles.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Great album.. if you like kendrick lamar/miguel/the weeknd you will love this guy. One of the best albums of the year!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|These books get better and better. I loved the Fifty series but the Bared series quickly became my favorite. The story line, the characters, the writing...it's all done so much better in this series. I'm not sure how long I can wait for another book; this wait almost killed me!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|We do not watch horror films, so this is the closest that we will come to a scary movie with our 8 year old.  He set his popcorn aside, eyes big during the scary scenes, and actually held our hand.  He was happy with the ending, and wanted to watch it again and again over the next few weeks.<br /><br />Warning: there is some language that I wish was not included, some silly efforts at teenage kissing, and a dead body that keeps falling in the arms of the children, but in fairness, nothing outside the realm of a well-rounded pirates story.  We discussed the film afterwards with our son, and actually enjoyed the &#34;learning moments.&#34;  If you are extremely protective of your children, this may not be the film for you.  If you supervise your children through classic literature, science fiction, novels and history, then this may be an enjoyable vacation into the fantastic.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love Firefly. I rewatch episodes often.It is so sad that Fox didn't have the vision to see the gem they had.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I would have rated Ms. Flynn's first novel, Sharp Objects,  4 stars if I hadn't read her second and third novels, Dark Places and Gone Girl, respectively.  Ms. Flynn's stories got successively better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Kept me guessing for hours. So fun. If you like a challenge or have a child you need to keep entertained, this is worth playing. Get it!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|A lot of classic songs, tributes to Dennis and Carl singing, wonderfully produced for a live album with crystal-clear vocals.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|After falling in love with TFIOS, I had extremely high expections for AUOK. It couldn't even come close. I felt the plot to be really flat. There wasn't even a good climax, and the ending seemed forced on to the reader much too fast. The footnotes were also extremely frustrating to flip back and forth between, especially because I was reading this on my kindle. Now don't get me wrong. If you like that kind of thing, this is definitely the book for you.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I really think Haley should have won American Idol. I haven't heard a bad vocal yet. I was THRILLED when I had the opportunity to by this CD. I have her on Pandora, too!<br /><br />You rock it, Haley!!! Thanks!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is a great game. I love how it tests your reflexes and how fast you can shoot or get out of the way of the obstacles.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Watched this movie over and over as a kid and it is just as awesome as an adult. This movie will always be a classic.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many interesting things to look at!  Lots of things to make yourself , can't get enough spend alot of time looking at things.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits has a wonderful mix of both comedy and drama.  I love how the show is a relatively clean show as well.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It continues the story started in Beautiful Creatures.  All the books are just too fantastic to even pretend to believe.  But for fantasy books, it is okay.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Holy crap this game is addictive. I plan on playing this game for a very long time. And here are some more words to reach the min.
1449437524|5.0|This should be the gift anyone who has owned, loved, and even lost a dog.  The drawings are so vibrant and portray the all the love and exuberance a dog brings into a person's life.<br /><br />Keep the books coming!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had Kindle for Android for quite some time now on my laptop but I needed to have it on my phone as that is on me nore often in areas and times that I cannot use my laptop. I can now get to read my favorite downloads with almost no effort and it is beautiful reading on my BLU 5.3 Android phone. Kindle for Android is the best!
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theater, and it was excellent. I know people don't think it's like the classic Wizard of Oz but it is a new millenium. I heard OOOO and AHHHH at the movies so let your kids watch and they will enjoy.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|You Tube on my computer and iPhone are much easier to navigate than this app.  I will probably not use it when my computer or iPhone is available.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Was a good movie and would make a very good TV series. The way it ended a sequel or prequel movie could follow.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is easy to navigate.  Can have several locations saved and switch back and forth easily. The radar feature makes it easy to zero in on a particular location.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Summary - allows charging Apple device with lightning connector and Apple's adapter when plugged into 2010 Nissan Murano iPod interface cable.<br /><br />I recently purchased an iPod nano to replace my venerable iPod mini, and I was dismayed to discover that it had a new plug - the \\"lightning\\" plug. To make it work with the interface cable in my Murano, I shelled out some more bucks for the lightning to 30 pin adapter. Good, so it plays, but ... it did not charge.<br /><br />After reading a few reviews here on Amazon and on various forums, I learned that the CableJive charge converter will often solve this problem. It didn't seem 100%, but close enough for me to give it a try. Viola! It works. It looks ugly having two adapters plugged into the bottom of the little nano (especially since Apple's designers apparently got lazy without Steve on their backs and designed their adapter so that it is offset when plugged into the nano). But it solved my problem, hence I am completely satisfied.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|I've been a big fan of the Transformers franchise since I was a kid. I watched all the cartoons, read all the comic books, seen every movie, and even bought a few action figures (yes, I am nerdy like that). But this movie lost me a few times and I found myself getting bored!  The special effects were great (which allowed me to give that third star), but the storyline could have been better. Thank goodness I was able to watch this through Amazon Prime.  I would have kicked myself if I bought the download or worse yet, the DVD...My rating system is based on three options...1. Spend the money and see it the theatres!  2. Rent it 3. Wait for it's cable TV release.  This is definitely a &#34;wait for cable TV release.&#34;  So sad. To sum it all up, it was boring...
B008Y720JU|5.0|It was a very good, wholesome movie with a message.  The acting was very good, too, which is always a plus.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Pretty good game! I l like the graphics a lot. It just sucks that you have to be connected all the time to play it! I wish there was a default mode that would let you even when there is no WiFi. I still gave it four stars though.
B000HZHBIM|3.0|The movie moves slow and the actions are extremely predictable.<br />The TV crew does their best to adapt to the big screen and Kirk's attitude and acting is no hum.
B007R21JJK|3.0|On the face of it, the board appears to be great. Reasonable price, plenty of features, great conncetivity. However, there are two annoying problems that prevent me from recommending this board completely. The first problem comes with a couple of USB ports in the back that periodically turn on and off. From the literature, Intel and VIA provide drivers for the USB ports, and as fellow reviewers have pointed out this causes numerous headaches for users. I updated my drivers and BIOS, but the intel ports still turn on and off. I even tried disabling the rapid charge tech they advertise. Not sure if I have a defective board but it renders those two ports completely useless. So instead of having 6 ports in the back, I have 4, which is not neough these days. The front ports are just not convenient or aesthetically pleasing for long term usage, so I am forced to use a USB hub.<br /><br />The second issue, concerns the incredibly long start up times. The board starts up, POSTs, and then the screen goes black for several minutes. Looking at the board , there arent any glaring error messages. In fact, if I shut off the computer via the power button, and start it up again, it will boot normally. I am not sure if the issue is with my video card (GTX670) or what but this happens on a random basis. I don't have the exact code that it flashes when it hangs, but after I did a quick search online it seems to be a common issue with no resolution. Here's hoping they figure it out soon.<br /><br />Otherwise the board is a solid performer, lots of options, and great for OC. Just wish I could figure out those two problems and then this board would be a champ.
1936608898|5.0|I was in need of a change. I felt sluggish all the time, my 4yo skin was always breaking out in rashes. I knew food was a big issue here. I always thought I ate pretty \\"clean\\", but after reading this book I realized what I was putting in me and my sons body was doing us damage. This book has changed our lives and eating habits for ever. We feel great, more vibrant, no bloating, skin looks and feels wonderful. I recommend to all my friends.
B0026O475M|5.0|Wonderful movie!  Very moving and emotional.  Those with a strong sense of empathy would be hard put not to feel for the characters.
B00021R7CG|5.0|THE HBO MOVIE WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN.  I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM ONE MINUTE TO THE NEXT.  VERY ENJOYABLE.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|Saxaphone music is my favorite and this CD does not disappoint.  I am new to jazz saxaphone and got this suggestion, believe it or not, from reading Michael Connelly Harry Bosch detective novels. If you read the series you will get all sorts of excellent hints on smooth jazz music to buy.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|This movie was so good and the ending was a super surprise i never saw coming.  I loved it so much!!
B007YZWW5K|4.0|Great buy, look forward to reading this book; I just finished The Silmarillion and am about to finish The Children of Hurin (I recommend both!). The only minor issue I had with the purchase was that the cover art was not the same as it is in the ad on amazon. Not a big deal, but if you want a consistent collection consider buying new. Otherwise great book/condition and it was shipped in great haste!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I love all books by John Grisham, he is by far my favorite author.  Looking forward to his next book in October.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|This is one of several in a series about Jesse Stone, a police chief in a small town.  Intriguing and worth watching.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Good building fun so far. My children can watch too which is great since they like strategy games too. We'll see how it goes.
B009C7JS14|1.0|This app is pretty look at, yes, but it's disgustingly inaccurate. Spoilers: It's completely useless unless you just want an app that lets you look at clouds scroll across your screen. It gets a single star for failed potential.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I like Queens of the Stone Age, but I get tired of their albums pretty fast. I've been playing this one at every opportunity, and I simply haven't been able to hit a 'get enough of it' limit yet. There's, as always, an undertone of sexy to every song, and a hint of melancholy.
1591845556|5.0|Once you have mastered a skill it takes a lot of time to make small improvements.  But, as this book explains, if you know nothing about some skill then with a small amount of the right kind of practice you can quickly go from incompetence to adequacy.  This book provides actionable advice on learning a new skill from scratch and then the author explains how he applied his technique to several domains including yoga, ruby, and go.  The book is kind of a generalized \\"Juggling for the Complete Klutz\\".
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I have always loved Arthur C Clark... a very imaginative writer.  it is incredible how &#34;right on&#34; much of his writing was in predicting future events.  I enjoyed the movie when it was new, but frankly, the book made much more sense.  Since this is one case of the movie and book being written together, the movie plot follows the book very well.  I think the entire approach was novel.
1594746168|4.0|I received this book as an Early Reviewer LibraryThing giveaway in exchange for an honest review. It's actually two books in one; the first is a biography of Dr. Spencer Black, a man who turned his medical genius to the creation of hybrid beasts, and the second is a bestiary of all those creatures he created through the dark surgeries he conducted. I really enjoyed this read. It has a delightful old school feel telling the tale of a mad scientist raised by a grave robber who becomes a carnival showman and descends into madness. Hudspeth's prose is a delight, and the anatomical drawings are gorgeous. My main regret is that the collection of drawings in the ARC I received was not complete.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Very creative and fast-moving storytelling.  I liked Mr. Cumberbatch in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, and he is fabulous in this series.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|The BeeGee's from 2001.  A couple of years before Maurice passed away and a decade before Robin left us.  The band is in top shape, the production was in Vegas and it was top shelf.  Lot's of disco fans in attendance.  The only disappointment with this concert is that the oldies where rundown in a medley format and there a few of those I would have loved to see fleshed out and given their proper due.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I like Blu Ray 3D and can watch that in my living room. I also have several DVD players throughout the house (kitchen-doing dishes) and portable DVD devices for trips.<br />I refuse to pay double for what should come as a combo set.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This installment seemed to jump all over the place.  There was plenty of great sex, but where is the great storyline that I read in the first two books.  So many unanswered questions .... Hopefully the next book will be a better read!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so excited to read the final book of the series only to find that it wasn't really the last book. The story is losing its interest and the love story is just being drug out to fill pages and create a fourth book. I'm not sure I'll be buying the next one.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|My dad was the first to start playing. I checked the game out and played it a little bit. It was awesome! I got it on my kindle and it is as good as the versions on the computer and Xbox 360. This is a game that I would immediately check out and get, plus, it it is free so you don't have to mess around with stuff that would get in you way. I spend almost every day playing on it, upgrading my samurai and farmers, preparing for wave 50. The zombies rising mode is also great. You get to unlock the shogun at wave 30 and the spider lady on wave 21. The shogun is pretty pathetic at level one though, buy gems and level him up. Both modes are the bomb and the allies are sick. This game is the best and you should buy it right away.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My wife wanted to see this so we rented it.<br /><br />It was great, kids can watch it and adults won't feel like they lost 2 hours of their life they won't get back!!!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I've following Star Trek since its inception. Having the collection is my dream come true. They've all been re-mastered and the colors are beautiful. I'll be watching these over and over again.  I originally had the collection in VHS.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Above all else this movie is a great lesson in Economics without the boring classroom lecture.<br /><br />After you watch the whole movie just ask yourself what happens on the day after the movie ends????<br /><br />My bet is within a year everyone who had all the time at the start of the movie would have it all back.<br /><br />Oh and look closely Johnny Galecki of Big Bang Theory and Roseanne makes what amounts to a long cameo. I did<br />not recognize him the first time I watched it!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A touching love story with cameo appearances from Kite Runner characters. Life doesn't always get tied up in neat little packages.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series gives a glimpse of what that day and age was like in regards to the social and economical classes. It's a revealing look inside of that era.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching each season.
B0094K20FK|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek movie next to Search for Spock (Star Trek III).  You just can't go wrong with a cast that has worked together so well for this long.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Barbara Demick catches us up on a world few people know. A country moving backwards by a government that does not want to lose control. She does a good job of filling the reader in on how North Korea got in its current economic position. She explains the decisions that we made by the government and the results. It was sad to read about a country that was torn apart and now continues to grow apart. I pray that one day Korea can reunite and the people of North Korea will become free.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Thought I would really like this.  Although the costume and set design is great, the story interpretation is not.  Very confusing to watch, stiff acting.  Couldn't finish watching it.
B005ZI3E46|4.0|My wife and I are big Taylor Swift fans and we really enjoyed this concert DVD, but the video is not really blu-ray quality. The audio quality is good, and if you have a good home theater sound system, crank it up and you'll feel like you're there.  The concert footage switches from onstage to crowd-based view from time to time and when it does, it takes a second or two to refocus which can be annoying. Having said that, this is as close as you're going to get to experiencing one of her shows other than actually being there.<br /><br />The extras were kind of cool, and the rehearsal footage shows how much work goes into one of her concerts. The home movies are very sweet and remind you how young Taylor is, which you kind of forget because she's such a pro.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good its like the subway version of temple run and its also got power-ups. the game is worth your time. The only complaint is that it doesnt have a story line(that i know of).
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This is one of the most disjointed books I've read in my life.  It skips between so many different groups of people and different timeframes that it's almost impossible to follow the storyline.  Unlike The Kite Runner, where you really got to know the characters and really cared what happened to them, this book doesn't develop the characters at all.  Come on Khaled!  Give us another Kite Runner!
B008F9E306|4.0|Glad to see Tip out of jail and back to doing what he's good at. Which is making good music.<br /><br />Wont bore you with a bunch of ranting he's still one of the best at commercial club bangers, chick songs as well as street tracks. It's not his best cd but it still better than most the crap out there now.<br /><br />Here are my Fav's:<br /><br />Trap back jumpin<br />Ball (despite Lil Wayne's lack luster verse)<br />Sorry<br />Can you learn<br />Guns and Roses<br />Who want some
B00CTERB2A|4.0|I love this show & I miss it. Funny, heartfelt, & entertaining. There were times I wished they go another direction, but good sci-fi.
B002ROKQJM|5.0|It Is a good tale of rags to riches showing how being in the wrong place at the right time can lead to success
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Differently a good read, this would be one of those books that you could lay out on the beach or curl up by the fire. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Excellent acting and cinematography, very clever writing and all around this was a delight.  Disney at his best!  I'll probably watch it again!
B009AMANH4|4.0|Enjoyed it--was a refresher course on Lincoln for this older lady.  My older children also enjoyed it and I hope they keep it for our very young grandchildren to watch in the years to come.  Holds your interest!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Vampire Weekend sure did not disappoint with this album. Almost all of the songs are 5/5. My favorites include Hannah Hunt, Step, Finger Back, Diane Young, and Ya Hey
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Thought provoking and inspiring movie! I could watch this movie over and over. Hopefully it motivates people to contemplate the significance of their actions
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book grabbed me from the beginning and never let go. This is the story of a normal family turned upside down in the midst of a town tragedy. As a parent, I found this book completely relatable. We always want to think the best of our kids and if their character comes into question, you would do just about anything to protect them. This book keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Worth reading!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I'm an adult who loves cartoons....good, there, I said it!!! The characters are great...I loved trying to figure out what type of animal they were.  Johnny Depp did a great job with Rango!
B00004W3L3|4.0|I really liked this cd.<br />This band was one of the best in the past.<br />All songs of this album are good.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I enjoyed both season 1 and season 2 with a 5 star for each ;  just wish there was more to come
0385344228|1.0|The book just did not work for me on many levels.<br />The Plot:<br />It felt like he started with a set of outcomes and just spun the  book around those. ( I could be specific but that will involve putting spoiler alert)<br />The plot is not clever. It is very mediocre. The shock element is achieved simply by stringing something unexpected. This is similar to the movie \\"Sixth Sense\\" only a lot dumber<br />The plot is not well structured or well researched. most of it is trivial.<br /><br />The characters:<br />They are very ho hum. No one is lovable no one is cringe inducing. They are just uninteresting. Only mildly interesting characters are the prosecuting ADA and the defense attorney. Both are woefully underdeveloped. The main characters are complex because of all the stuff they carry. Kind of like a badly designed yet fully loaded car. There are tons of things to \\"figure out\\" of but none is interesting or useful. Even if you figure it out, the feature is not worth the trouble you need to go through.<br />The supporting cast ( Derek, the shrink The Grandfather, the thug, Patz, the judge all are ill-developed despite the use of ample print space)<br /><br />The narration<br />This is where the book really stinks. It is plainly bad. It is tedious. You could skip pages after pages. They do not add to the plot in a meaningful way ( perhaps because the plot is so lousy?) neither they provide insight, nor do they entertain. The whole conversation with the shrink is a waste of space ( and the reader's time)<br />The dialog is not snappy. The prose is not flowing let alone lyrical. Neither is it entertaining  (even if in a frivolous way a-la-Grisham )<br /><br />The court scenes:<br />They may be the only half decent part of the book. They feel realistic but once again nothing spellbinding or captivating here.<br /><br />I read two books by the swimming pool on weekend so far this summer. The Innocent by Scott Turlow and this one. Innocent was a decent score, this was atotal miss.
B00AEFXEZE|5.0|I remember going to the movie theatre with a girlfriend at the time, when this film first came out. She turn too me all flushing when Mr. Richard G. roll out of the bed in full nudity, just standing there by the window..\\" and Lauren Hutton caressing the sheet.. An American Classic..!
B004SGWYVA|4.0|I have to say I enjoyed this anime and put it in my top 10, considering how many anime series I've watched, probably close to 70ish.  This anime has tons of humor, though not as funny as &#34;Is this a Zombie&#34; it is still quite funny.  It has good character development which is very important if you are a true critic.  It has lots of eye candy if youre in to that kind of thing, I'm not really huge on that but it does have quite a bit, to me they put a little too much emphasis on that instead of continuing the story at times.  I give it 4 stars and I rate anime pretty hard, I would recommend this anime.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I know that we are about to get update since the iPhone has BUT I beat the game and NEVER got the final prize. The message said to look in my inventory but it was not there. Not nice. Some ponies are still too pricey for rubies and there is not enough magic shards given for the needed purpose in Canterlot. Fix What about visiting or sending gifts to friends via Gameloft?? That started to mess up right after the last update.<br />I still love this addictive pony game.<br />Fix these issues and I will give it 5 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I hope this becomes a movie one day!!  I will never hold my husbands pinky and not think of this book!!<br /><br />It touched on some sensitive subjects but also teaches the art of healing and trusting!  What an amazing story!!!
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I have been waiting for this move to be released on Blu-ray for a while. The price was great and it looks great on Blu-ray!! It also comes with a DVD copy which is useful for traveling and use in a portable DVD player. This is an awesome movie!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Gideon more and more throughout these books.  This is a MUST read.  the &#34;dirty language&#34;  does make my cringe at times... and mind you I've read a LOT of similar books.... but she seems to take this to a different level at times.  Regardless I love the series and will continue to be a loyal follower!
B009R659L8|5.0|I started reading this book and couldn't put it down.  I love all of Mary Higgins Clark books.  You can't go wrong with her.  They are good clean, fun, mysteries!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Can't stop listening to this CD. With every CD that I buy, there is  usually at least one song that I don't like that much. This CD has broken that trend for me. LOVE IT AND HIM!!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I downloaded this public-domain classic during a book-club meeting, when a fellow member had forgotten to bring his copy. Then I realized I had never actually read the original, so I did. Dickens was a true artist with words. I love the sense of period I get when I read his work.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I will use this review to complain about Amazon:<br />#1.  I gave this book 4 stars; that means it was pretty good, not the best ever but pretty good.<br />#2.  If it was bad I would have gave it less than 4 stars, maybe 2 or one.<br />#3.  The fact that Amazon requires you to write an essay at the end of every book you want to rate is outrageous.  I am not a writer, author, or poet.<br />#4.  You may be thinking 'why does he write a review then?'.  Well I like to rate the books I've read because of the recommendations that Amazon provides.<br />#5.  Don't get me wrong, I love using Amazon and I use the site a lot and my Kindle never leaves my side.  It is this \\"required\\" written review that really drives me nuts.<br /><br />Well, that's all I have to complain about during this book review.  If you made it this far into it thank you for your time.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Every so often I read Grisham's latest; not because there is anything of value but they are fast reads and do not clutter my mind.  This isd typical.
B004AKCME8|5.0|The product was in good shape and a welcome addition to our collection of movies that the whole family can enjoy.<br />The Seller provided a product that is in great condition and will be used frequently
B001KL3GY0|5.0|This a great disk! If you don't own this you should purchase it right now! No throw away songs on this! Great Stuff!!!!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|My kids love it when the trunchbull gets her just desserts.  They keep replaying it in the dvd player.<br />It was in good shape just needed cleaning and then no problem
B000HL09MG|4.0|Strange story line, kinda jumps around a bit. Left a few un answered questions which was okay. Overall a good film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best ever!  Where's Season 3?  I spent at least a day and a half watching both Seasons 1 and 2.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book. Can't wait for the next one.hope that the movie can keep up with Flynn . Love the series of Mitch Rapp
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book is simply a joy to read. The story is told with such honesty and clarity that it feels good to read about Francie and her life.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this game is sooooooooo dreaming fun you get to be a big buff guy a sniper a medic a soldier and a stealth Man
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Super Hollywood, full of chases and special effects with no real other content. Boring. Bond isn't even that suavely handsome to keep it interesting.
B005HSL626|5.0|This was a really fun game. The graphics and sounds were terrific. My niece who is 5 played with it for a long time
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I'm completely appalled at Sylvia Day. I've waited for the finale of this trilogy only to reach the end and find out this isn't the last one. That's misleading and quite frankly I'm disgusted. The storyline was repetitive. Disappointed that it took me longer than seven days to read it...I can't get a refund. Buyer beware!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I enjoyed the graphic design. Challenging levels and it was fun to play. I enjoy the series of this particular one.
076115678X|5.0|One of the best books for girls with curls. I have used many techniques within this book and I get compliments daily on my hair.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|The plot was somewhat predictable and the acting was tolerable.  Not one of McConaughey's better flicks. I watched passing the time in my hotel, so it served the purpose.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use the app to down out hubby's snoring as I am falling asleep. I love how it can automatically set it's end time as soon as I open the app. Thanks for fixing the issue that was preventing me from downloading new sounds!
B007L6VR6M|2.0|I really did.  All strapped in ready for some side-splitting laughs and guffaws and yet these movies (Moonrise Kingdom, The Life Aquatic, Royal Tenebaums) really don't hold a candle to the original Rushmore perhaps due to the era in which they were released (Bush/Obama 2000s vs Clinton 90s).  I know they're not sequels or supposed to be related in an way even though many of the actors are the same.  It's just that as supposed comedies, there's a hell of a lot of down time between laughs, too many serious moments and an emphasis on cleverness and useless information that I just don't need.  These generally aren't funny movies, they're interesting movies, some scenes of which are wonderfully filmed and acted out.  Beautiful scenery, sets, imagination, special effects.  All the films have their humorous moments but for the most part, they seem to rely and focus on life's quirky little oddities, strange coincidences and the \\"just keep it safe\\" factor is in full swing, rarely venturing into LOL territory as Rushmore seemed to accomplish at all times.  Bill Murray has done a wonderful job over the past decade (or maybe more) of reprising his role as some kind of manic-depressive, mid-life crisis husband or divorced father of three who can't wait to frown on camera or say something average.  Kids will probably get a kick out of these movies because there is a fantastical, Harry Potter/Finding Nemo feel.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I can not believe this is the author's debut novel.  I laughed out loud several times.  I loved how Kate was such a challenge for Drew and made him work so hard.  Where did the author get her male insight?  It was too funny!
B005USZYDU|5.0|this book is a great page turner and is a great murder story.  I was a little dissapointed with the ending but still a great book by Grisham
B0000042MY|5.0|I gave this soundtrack as a gift. The person has already listened to it dozens of times and loves it.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|An awesome CD by Phillip Phillips!! The guy is amazing and this is a great CD. You will love it.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I bought this for residents of a nursing home. They enjoy the songs and old time story. Many of them remember seeing this when it was first released.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was frustrating but once I figured what a clue meant, it was like a high! I loved it! Would recommend it to friends!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Yes buy it now and check out ma youtube (same user)  BUT BACK TO THE GAME, THROW MONEY AT THIS GAME ITS REALLY  GOOD! !!(FOR PC AND APPS)
B007IK44CK|3.0|Even with this plot having been done before with some of the 007 movies  it is Ok.  While I am not a Tom Cruz fan he does alright in this movie.  You can watch it maybe 2 time  to get some of the finer points and plots.  I was not impress with the female lead in the movie. Techie guy was funny and good and the guy who was assigned to protect Tom wife was good too.  The Bad guy is the kind  of villain that been done before and needs a real facelift and something new. Not this super crazy guy who keeps  showing up in all the MIF & 007 movies.  Something along the lines of Jaws or maybe super evil person like Red Skull
B003O86FMW|5.0|The whole series is absolutely great! It is well written and hard to put down once I started. Couldn't wait to get to the 3rd.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Good movie, one needs to know a little about Lincoln's history to really enjoy the movie, other wise it could be on the boring side.<br />I'm familiar with Lincoln's history and enjoyed it. Wanting to watch it again to really get the full value of the show..
0756404746|5.0|Was a great book. Bought it after having it recommended to me by amazon and do t regret it. It's cool how the story is told by Kvoth himself
B00D611UMM|5.0|If you are a fan of Alison Moyet or of her old band Yazoo, you won't be disappointed with this album. I can't tell you how many times I have listened to it since I bought it. Great album from start to finish.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The premise of the series is somewhat different from other 'cop' series.  Patrick Jane assists a team from the California Bureau of Investigation as a consultant by using his exceptional gift of observation.  In this way, the team is able to close an exceptional number of cases.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm not really a fan of zombies shows/stories but I can't get enough of this show. It totally freaks me out. The suspense kills me more than anything else but I like the show, I think it was really well done and the music by Bear McCreary is fantastic!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|What a family!  With such early influences, no wonder the mafia grew up in Italy (Sicily).  An intriguing and much anticipated series.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This season is a little slow, especially when they're just hanging around on the farm but I really like the show. The last few episodes made it worth it.
B0064J6P8W|3.0|It was entertaining. It's a good rainy day or nothing else to watch movie. You will like it a lot
B002VPE1WK|1.0|I've used this backpack on and off for over a year. Recently, two of the zipper pulls ripped off during normal use.    If you were wondering what this backpack's life expectancy was, I can pretty comfortably say that it's about a year.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|I found this both confusing and not very convenient.  i have removed it from my Kindle and will continue looking for a different calendar/journal
0307010856|5.0|My husband and I read this book to our 30 year old son when he was a baby, and now we bought it for him to read to his son.  My son was ecstatic that he is able to continue the tradition - a true classic.  Highly recommended!!!
B008IJT0CE|3.0|Good sounds, but I erased it before I was able to put it to the test (it takes too much memory!).
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app was great until they started placing unclosable ads in the center of the videos making videos unwatchable. Completely useless now.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is better than Google reader. I love the categories and the colors. It's easy to navigate. I really love it.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Okay folks, no one goes to see a Tom Cruise movie for his &#34;depth of character&#34; portrayals, with that said, &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; doesn't disappoint.  Reacher is a specialized military policeman who is very good a tracking and apprehending wayward soldiers...highly trained soldiers who have special skill sets.  The plot thickens in this &#34;kick-butt&#34; action movie when a sniper shooting takes place in Pittsburgh and the Local police detective and District Attorney close the case all too quickly.  The suspect requests Jack Reacher and miraculously Jack shows up from &#34;off the grid&#34;.  Lots of reallty good  hand to hand combat scenes and gun play.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This is a great mouse for the money. The buttons and feel are pretty solid and the added weight makes the mouse feel very nice. Great product.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Wasn't interested in this series in the fall when it started but caught part of episode 3 and was hooked!  Have seen all of season 1 and can't wait for season 2.  A good story and a good thriller so far.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Love FREECELL and this is a good game for the money.  I would like to have a restart button with the buttons on the top without having to access a separate additional button first.  Also I like to have other versions of the game so boredom doesn't set in as I REALLY DO like FREECELL!
0738711500|4.0|Great book and card set for acquiring a basic understanding of the tarot and then getting your feet wet with readings. Very easy to follow - you will not get bored! :)
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I love the speed of this charger! I was really impressed at how fast it charged my Kindle. Very happy with this product.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was so intrigued - I didn't want the book to end! Jacob's character is a reminder of how many parents don't realize that their child needs help.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Love this show! I am so happy I can stream it now because it just got cancelled. I will be watching it a lot!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|My fiancee and I started watching this series casually since we had heard good things about it and we were instantly hooked. It's very violent, though, and I doubt I'd let my 14 year old watch this if I had one. (Well, maybe they could watch it with me so I could answer questions as they came up.) It's very well written, my fiancee is a big fan of the movies and she likes this new series as well. I made the mistake of watching this while eating, I wouldn't recommend that but you can if you'd like. Also wouldn't recommend watching it in a dark room by yourself but I guess that's more of a personal preference.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I downloaded this app thinking that I would use it a lot but I really don't use it at all because I can't get the full keyboard on my iPad and that is irritating. It's hard to play anything when you have to stop to hit an arrow to get to the next key.
0670022411|5.0|I've really enjoyed this series.  I'm waiting for the last book of the trilogy.  In fact, I check every month to see if it has been released. I highly recommend this book to friends.  I have a wide variety of books I read, this series meets my needs in several categories; historical fiction, science fiction, fantasy.  Get this book you won't be disappointed, unless like me you are waiting for  book three and then you might be disappointed every month.  I'm sure<br />Ms. Harkness is working hard and I will not be disappointed when it is finally released!  Thanks, Deborah!
B000T45CDM|5.0|This may be my all time favorite Johnny Depp movie, Al Pacino delivers an excellent \\"Lefty\\" in a self deprecating role that should have everyone convinced he's not acting. There's laughs, there's serious moments, and all in all we have a peek at what a real Undercover FBI agent went through to break up a chunk of the Mafia. This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00ADMYN9E|5.0|Forget about all the other ufo books, this is the only one you need to read to find the truth about what is happening in our skies. I could not put this one down. It answered all the questions that I had about alien visitations to our planet. I don't know how this book hasn't made front page news in every newspaper and tv news program's around the planet. Do yourself a favour, read it and be enlightened.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I took the whole family to see this movie and they couldn't wait til it came out on DVD.  Once it finally did it was bought within hours of being released and watched.  It came with the digital upload which I did.  The family is most pleased.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Our pastor mentioned this movie... along with several friends.  The absolute epitome of biblical love portrayed; well, at least about as good as it gets in this world!!! We will be buying this movie -- I just HAVE to see it again :).
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I love the game so much! The only complaint I have is how long it took to get to my house, but that really has to do all with the seller.  However I did get it from England because it was the cheapest shipping so I can't really complain! :) But the game is really good though.  If you like Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, then you will like 3 because there is so much more you can do and it actually makes it seem more like a real park!
1623420148|5.0|I know one reviewer who didn't like Tangled because of the liberal use of profanities. True but that's just how the story demands it. Andrew Evans is rich, spoilt and does not believe in love or forever ever after. He's a complete man-whore and he loves it. I've had to stop reading a few times because I found him a bit off putting in the beginning. Fortunately, he has a few redeeming qualities which saves him from being an absolute pig. Drew gets his come-uppence when meets a woman he wants but can't have and thus begins his journey into hell and then complete redemption.<br />The story is told in Drew's voice. He is hilarious and really quite lovable. I still can't believe this book was written by a woman! This is a well written story with a very endearing and memorable character! A definite must-read!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|a waste of time,  i could follow but did not want to, simply put a bad movie. your time is worth more than this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You'll have a lot of fun reading this book! It doesn't matter your age or if you like romance or action. It's got it all!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game helps me move my thoms faster only if I listen to music you should too just do it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I did like the book although it could have been shorter.  The genetic influence made for a good story as well as the dad's refusal to face the truth.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book provided insightful easy to follow step by step details on how to prepare your work template for creating good looking, functional ebooks. I personally even learned some things about Microsoft Word that I didn't know about before.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am a HUGE HP fan and I watched each movie in theater. I waited a few years after the last came out to get the set and it was very worth it! The price was great and shipping unbelievable! I had myself a HP weekend and was one happy person! Thank you Amazon!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I've finished the trilogy.  Zipped thru the sex and enjoyed the story.  Some great cliffhanger moments.  Really a great human interest story
B002E0JL4A|5.0|xcellent and special movie everyone should see. It has content is fun and most importantly a really beautiful message of life.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Such an epic journey and a really informative read :D  I'd recommend it to anyone - even those who don't run!
B002NZK5RI|4.0|I love thrillers, and I somehow managed to miss COPYCAT until now. I can't join the reviewers who carry on about it as if it were the greatest thriller ever (it isn't), but I enjoyed it. Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are an interesting combination, and it's always nice to see not 1 but 2 strong females in one story, especially this kind of story. But the plot is rather routine, and the characters (nervous woman psychologist, tough woman cop, sensitive male cop, mother-fixated loony, wisecracking gay assistant, disgusting incarcerated serial killer who offers to help find the new killer) all seem to have come from Central Casting. They're all \\"types\\" rather than 3-dimensional human beings. Other than their actions in this story, we never learn a single thing about any of them. Do they have families? Friends? Other interests beside their jobs? Political or religious beliefs? Plans for the future? We never learn any of this, only what they're doing right now, in this moment. Where they came from and what will happen to them after the final credits roll is a mystery.<br /><br />Still, it's very entertaining. The most interesting aspect is the direction of Jon Amiel--he piles on the style, making everything look dark and dank, even the \\"normal\\" places (Sigourney Weaver's well-appointed waterfront home looks positively sinister). There's never enough lighting in any scene, and that's obviously deliberate--it makes you feel nervous even when nothing horrible is happening. Amiel took a standard \\"serial-on-the-loose\\" tale and made it look and sound a lot better than it probably is, and the cast is excellent (a particular shout-out to Harry Connick, Jr., who's downright creepy). Lots of stylish touches, lots of thrilling sequences, and a satisfying conclusion add up to a good. solid--but not very profound--popcorn movie.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this game doesnt work well on kindle fire hd. there is an app called hill climb that works really well that is more advanced and easier.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|In my experience it is exceedingly difficult for something to be both educational and entertaining. This book finds the balance perfectly.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Free and fun you can't get any better than that and it works on kindle hd which is good. I recommend it to any one add me as a friend Sadiyq 101
B0089LOG02|5.0|I get so tired of reading mystery, and its hard to find something fiction, but historically correct also. Characters in this book are well developed, plot line is great. I devour books, so if I give it a 4 or 5 you should read it!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best  book ever! I used to think JK Rowling was the best author ever, but I was totally wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book is awesome and is totally not a waste of money and time. If I had to recommend a book,it would be this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun!! It teaches you how to care for horses like feeding them and training them.It is the best game ever!!!!!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|One of the best books ever! You have to love the characters in this book, especially Hazel and her cussing magic horse, Percy and definitely silly Chinese Canadian baby man  !
B006M4RN3U|5.0|My husband, son and I play this in the car when we go on long drives and we play a few of the songs over and over and sing as loud as we can.  It is so much &#34;fun&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter has been playing non stop! Great for car rides & waiting around at gymnastics, dance etc. good clean non violent creative fun
B008J34466|5.0|This is a really terrific album.  My five year old loves the songs. Beautiful singing. I recommend it for all ages.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I don't know what to say about a song.  You either like it or you don't.  It's way different than most Daft Punk so there's that I guess.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I really enjoyed this album, in particular the very classic jazz feel mixed with modern electric. The songs featuring Pharrell are also very likable.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I found this tale of self-destructive behavior to be really depressing.  It was a waste of my time and money.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|My first experience with The Neighbourhood was last summer when I heard &#34;Female Robbery&#34; on the radio.  I was hooked on the song and asked my friend if he heard of the band and the song.  He was impressed and I was hopeful that I wasn't listening to a one-hit-wonder.<br /><br />Come this year, I found Neighbourhood's other singles and was not disappointed.  What sealed the deal was &#34;Sweater Weather&#34;; God, this song gets me hot and bothered!  I couldn't wait for this album's release and once I received it, I always find a reason to listen to it.  There is something for everyone on each track and nothing is the same.<br /><br />My favorite song is &#34;Flawless&#34;, hence the title.  The arrangement conveys such emotion of what an insatiable love affair sounds like.  Second: &#34;Alleyways&#34; which tells the story of a troubled adult (undertones of an addict) reminiscing about the carefree days of being a kid.  It's a deeply emotional, powerful track that anyone can relate to.<br /><br />The Neighbourhood has such an original sound that I can see being around for a very long time.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Love a movie where you have to keep track of what's going on from the beginning in order for the end to make sense.<br /><br />Also fun to watch the actors go through different personna.<br /><br />Seldom do I watch a movie that sticks in my head the way this one did.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I think the story is original and thought out really well by the writer George Martin, the characters have depth and you feel you are a part of the story as it goes and the reader (at least this is true for myself) starts hoping for their favorite character to come out on top. I would highly recommend these books to anyone who likes high fantasy or political intrigue.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Yeah, 2 CD's and a DVD of 33 videos, all for $11.99? You kidding me? This is a great purchase and is a great compilation of Garth!
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Not a family movie, per se, Burton's films rarely are, but really entertaining and witty. It is easily my favorite film from Burton, a classic dark comedy film we still watch from time to time.
B002QBS9KE|4.0|While I love my Voyager bluetooth ear-piece I hate that the eartips wear out. The replacements should last me longer than my mobile phone or mobile phone contract. If you have a Voyager ear-piece get the extra eartips they'll be worth it in the long run.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|this is such a good movie, not just for the girls but my husband loved this movie to, already talking about watching it tomorrow!!!! ( I barely EVER watch the same movie 2 times)
B00632HWOG|5.0|Regular Yahoo mail would not work correctly on my Impression I10 Android Tablet, but this app works wonderfully for me.  Now I can actually reply to emails, delete Spam and other things I could not do before.  It is designed to be very easy for the user.  Also, it blocks the ads that ate up my bandwidth before.  5 stars to this app and the designers of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love everything about this book. Now that I've finished the trilogy, I m sharing in Katniss' thoughts and viewpoints.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Absolutely thrilling! With plots constantly twisting and pulling at heart strings. Amazing. I really hope There's another one coming.And soon!
B00AEFXAH6|5.0|great chemistry between two high powered actors makes this one of the best films of the action buddy genre Nolte and Murphy are off the charts good togrther
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|What can I say, it's Nalini Singh. She can do no wrong in my eyes, but I must say this book was beyond superb. Excellent job!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love it. Big Bang is a great show. Makes both me and my teenager laugh.  We do not usually think the same things are funny.
B001ER4CTI|5.0|big scale, cool items incide, reasonable price!<br />amazing art photos, good editional materials on a dvd discs.<br />very thrill art book with a lenticular
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I loved this movie, but it did leave me right at the most exciting part; so I am anxious for the next one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daugter loves this game she is really into my little pony.  now she has a game she can play
B002RXS1NQ|5.0|imagine being 10 years old and sitting in a theater in 1931. and you see the monster for the first time. i have to believe you would be hiding under the theater seat before long or hiding in the bathroom as the monster walked thru that doorway for the first time. this film never gets old. there is one scene that is stange but also humorous at the same time. it's the scene where dwight frye starts to ascend a set of stairs and stops to pull his socks up. was he giving himself more screen time? was he saying that even though i'm a henchman, i still understand the idea of style? it's just a weird little moment. but, anyway. this is a great film that is truly unappreciated just like the sequel. the scene in the windmill and the fire that &#34;destroys&#34; the monster is one of the best of all time.
B009NY43NY|2.0|While not quite as terrible as the last two books in the series, the book was not phenomenal or even on par with earlier books in the series.  Some things are wrapped up, as befits the end of the series, which was nice to see.  Other things were left wide open.
B0013V33DG|5.0|This is a funny opera, well performed by all the singers, especially Natalie Dessay, who is quite comical and Juan Diego Florez, who sings his heart out.  Donizetti himself would be proud of this production!
B00633W614|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Can't wait to read the next book in the series. Jeffrey Archer has come up with a great storyline.
B0084O8P9C|5.0|Like other reviewers, I, too, like to listen to this CD where it is convenient to skip a track.  But, the music is haunting and fits the theme &#34;water&#34; theme of the movie.  I admit it's not for everyone, but it suits my taste.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'VE PLAYED IT ON FACE BOOK BUT ITS EVEN BETTER ON  MY KINDLE,, I DO SO MUCH BETTER,, I ALSO DO GOOD ON MY IPHONE.. I AM ALWAYS ON THE HIGH SCORE FOR THE WEEK.. ITS A CHALLENGEE ALSO TO GET AS MUCH OF A HIGH SCORE AND OUT BEAT THE OTHER PEOPLE PLAYING .. USUALLY FROM FACEBOOK WHOM ALREADY HAVE PLAYED THIS BEFORE.. I WOULD GIVE IT AN A++
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like survival mode because u can build a house without unlimited resources. I just wish mojang would make it so you can switch from creative mode to survival mode and vice versa.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|WASTE OF TIME , ENERGY, AND EYESIGHT... TRY IT FOR YOURSELF BUT I PERSONALLY DIDNT LIKE IT AND REMOVED IT SOON ENOUGH
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great movie. 4 copies!! Funny at times, dramatic at others. Definitely Tarantino at his finest. Quality is incredible. A Must own if you have a Blu-ray Player!
B004SRNH10|3.0|I got this app thinking that it would be a good addition to my tablet. For some odd reason I never found a use for it. Could be very good since no one creates something without a purpose, but I just didn't see the purpose.
0425263924|1.0|Don't waste your money or time.  This book was truly awful.  There is absolutely nothing good to say - furthermore, this was supposed to be a trilogy and is now a quint.  Dirty trick by an author.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|i chose this rating because the back kept coming off and would not function properly. i would not recommend this product to anyone. i ended up taping it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Well put together plot and great acting equals terrific movie. Nolan and Snyder need to work together again. I hope there will be a second one. This blows iron man 3 out of the water.
