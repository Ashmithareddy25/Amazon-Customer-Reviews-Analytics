B008645YEE|5.0|Love this music!  Hans Zimmer is of course amazing, and you'll feel like you're enjoying the movie all over again.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It was a good read. I have become a Blake Crouch fan and have read many items of his work.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I love science fiction and this movie was very creative.  There were some loose ends and the pickiest of critics might spaz over the flaws, but it really gets your imagination pumping, and has a slight grittiness that makes it feel real.  Love it!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I have all of the other Train CDs and love them and this one is no exception.  Great songs, great beats.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I love watching this movie with my daughter. It is very kid appropriate and the characters are relatable. Your child will love this movie.
B001HN6922|5.0|I ordered this movie at the request of a small boy who would not have got the gift he wanted otherwise.  He loved it!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|A little repetitive but overall fun and sometimes challenging.  Would rate higher if occasionally levels would bug forcing me to wait out the timer to retry.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I. think this game is a very impressive piece of art the game is really fun except that it takes a long time to get polnt which is annoying when you want a game.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|From the extras disc interviews it appears that Clapton was the catalyst to reunite them after 37 years; Baker was not too keen; and Bruce sounded like he wanted to keep on going. Years have had their toll; all 3 play with less intensity and more finese but the songs still hold up.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is perfect, especially for the kindle fire hd since there is no indicator light. I also love that it tells you exactly how much time you have to do various things. cool visually too!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Started with the 4 Hour Chef and my boyfriend and I love it so much we bought the other books in the 4 Hour Family as well. The book is well written and witty which makes it a pleasure to read and since its full of useful information and quick tips, the content is readily applicable to our time in the kitchen. For example, The Sexy Time Steak tutorial has revolutionized our steak night. We used that one right away. I highly recommend this read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|What a fun game. Starts off easy and gets a little tough as you progress. A lot of fun, And my seven year old enjoys it as well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My exact beliefs put into clear and concise words, thank you.<br />I would like all my friends and family to read this, but in reality I know they are not all open and ready for such knowledge.<br />Joanna
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book really helped me to come a long way in my book writing process. Only problem is, does it cost me anything? Can't tell well guess I'll just have to find out myself.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not believe that this book could rate so high before I read it.  Now I know why it did.  The writing is so good.  I did not want it to end.  Enjoyed it, can't wait to read anything else from this author.  Her first two books are good, this one is awesome.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|One of the best cast, and subjects... Like the idea...,and time line.. all in all I see this movie getting a lot of awards...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R.R. Martin writes this book in the view of many different characters.  Each chapter is a different character's viewpoint,  which at times can get a little confusing until you've gotten a grasp on who is who.  It is mainly about the main houses of the kingdom: the Starks, Lannisters, Targaryons and Baratheons.  It is exactly what the title says, a game of thrones.  It is each house fighting for the throne at one point or another for very different reasons.  It is very well written and amazingly detailed.  It is very interesting to see how every small thing each character does affects the other characters.  You will also root for some characters and hope and pray others are killed.  Just an FYI, don't get too attached to any character, he likes to kill off the much loved characters more frequently than the much hated characters.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's a make a zoo game like others.I've only had it two days but I'm not rushing to feed anyone.my seven year old who loves animals didn't really show any interest. That Would probably be different if she had her own device.  I like the graphics.my elephants do seem to wonder past their enclosure. I like the rescuing part of the game,that seems to be different than others I've downloaded.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I believe that this is the largest book in the series and it seemed to take forever to read but every moment was enjoyable.  Fighting for the throne has calmed down a good deal in this book while everyone is licking there wounds and replanning their attacks.  We get to read in Jaime's perspective, how I hated him in the first two books, and now I actually kind of like him.  George R.R. Martin kills off quite a few of his main characters in this book.  One of which I had been wishing for all along.  That alone makes it worth reading this book.  A couple of others I was SHOCKED about but I guess you cannot get too close to these characters.  This book is so far my favorite in the series.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|A very good book. A must read for all Rom-Com fans!! :):) Its simply superb. My favourite Sophie Kinsella book so far!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book continues on where the first one left off.  More characters are introduced as they become key players in the game of thrones.  It is hard to discuss it without giving too much away.  In the first book there is only one king, in this book there are 4 kings: Joffrey, both of Robert Baratheon's brothers and Rob Stark.  The Starks would like to avenge the death of Ned Stark while Baratheon's brothers are trying to take the throne away from Joffrey.  Danaerys is on the other side of the world trying to get prepared to take the throne back when the time is right.  This book is a little more exciting than the first.  There is fighting and large battles taking place everywhere.  And of course key players also die in this book so don't get attached!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This did not work at all with my kindle fire.  Maybe it was defective, but i'm not really sure.  Would not buy again.
0756666937|5.0|Great book. My 8 year old loves it! Wonderful illustrations and interesting info throughout. He is always reading this it seems. Stirs up imagination for sure.
B002361MLA|4.0|I read a lot of books on spirituality and this one follows the same line of thinking. It's a little academic and I'm not sure it simplifies the concepts of Being, inner peace ect.. In a way that the average reader would be able to grasp. It isn't written for the beginner in this journey.
B005LAII62|5.0|Paranorman is one of the most progressive movies I've seen in a long time. The story consists of relatable characters, an intriguing plot, and excellent animation. Paranorman is a film that appeals to all age groups and is very much a family-appropriate movie.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This was a great purchase for my niece for Christmas! She was excited! Great purchase! I would recommend this item.
0060872675|5.0|This is a good book, fun for children and adults alike, though it might not be for all children.  As with any book you give to your children, make sure to read it first.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD has some really incredible music on it.  My son and I both play cello, so we have a great appreciation for it, but even if you don't play an instrument, you will be blown away by the arrangements.  The Piano Guys have lots of videos online as well.
B000XXGMUQ|5.0|This boot is what you are looking for if you like high quality. I &#34;used&#34; to wear Polo boots but not anymore. The Earthkeepers are light and they have an outstanding grip on the ground. Wear these boots with some starched jeans and you become the man.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So, I accidentally downloaded just the first book and got to the last pages and screamed \\"NOOOOOOOOO!!!\\" Luckily, after a quick call to my friends who recommended it, they told me I needed to buy the set and keep going. My fingers couldn't hit \\"purchase\\" fast enough. I just needed to keep reading and reading.....and finished in one day. Initially I thought, oh boy, another variation of The Lottery. But no, much more depth, personal relationships (I cried once) and the winner that kept me going. Thank you, Mr. Howey
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|OMG! one of the worst movies Ive ever seen! Reminded me of those 1980's B movies they use to do by a company called Golan and Globus. You know the same people who did superman 4 . The fighting scenes are stiff and the story laughable. And the ending really stupid. I promise you that at the end of this flick you will be saying \\" is that it,  that's the ending \\"? What a crock!! So don't buy it cause you will regret it.  I still do!
B003O86FMW|4.0|It deserves four stars for painting such a clear imagine in your mind of what is going on. At times I got a little confused but overall the book was great and I can't wait to read the third !
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|even though i had not read the first two of this trilogy first, knowing a lot of these characters first made the book interesting,  glad to see this.  will read the previous two soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is most likely my favorite hunger games book. It sucked me in and I finished it in less than a day!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was a amazing book filled with suspense and adrenaline. I can't wait for the next book in this series.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|As a Mars geek, I'm pretty jaded when it comes to stories & movies about Mars. Most are awful but I grabbed The Martian based on some good reviews. What a surprise. Weir nails the science and engineering and lingo of Mars. If you've followed Spirit & Opportunity and MSL, you'll appreciate the technical details. If you haven't, no worries. All that just provides a backdrop to a great adventure tale which is also at times, laugh out loud funny. Highly recommended. Up there with WOOL by Hugh Howey as my favourite reads of 2012. Support this independent author. For $0.99 you can't go wrong.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I like this game . it is fun for the Kindle . that is all I want to say about this game .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!!!!  What a beautiful story. The characters are fabulous. There are parts that made me laugh, and cry. This story is intense! It only took the first two pages and I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. I kept telling myself just one more chapter and then I would go to sleep ....next thing I know it is 2 am.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Amazing book!<br />Recommend to people who like action books and movies,this was the best of all three books. Thumbs up.  :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Didnt like the ending the rest of the book was great i could not put it down hoping the next one picks up pace
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy did it again!  Action filled I was unable to put it down. Cannot wait for the next one. Jr follows in his dad's footsteps.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is the best tv series and worth the price. It is not only about zombies but about life and how we interact with others.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|I loved the Soundgarden, Led Zeppelin, Temple of the Dog and Audioslave songs Chris did.  The most please surprise was the cover of Led Zeppelin's &#34;Thank You&#34;.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Completely captivating.  I couldn't put the book down.<br />The author brings all characters to life brilliantly.  The suspense was intoxicating.
0786889284|5.0|I loved this book!  Oh my gosh it was an edge of the seat - can't wait to find out what happens next - quickly turning pages book.  Wow... another great book by Ridley Pearson and one that I will definitely add to my favorites list.  I love Lou Boldt and the other characters and the plot has more twists and turns than....  Be prepared for some violence and descriptive moments and hang on to your seat!
B005LAII12|5.0|This is a great product as well as service.<br />I received the product in a reasonable amount of time without any difficulties.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|My Mother loves hearing anything by Phillp Phillips and she was so excited to receive this CD for Christmas. She played it later in the day when guests came over to celebrate Christmas dinner. Her favorite song is of course Home but she has enjoyed the CD many times from beginning to end.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book. Have read it many times over the years. Would recommend it to anyone. Nothing but enjoyment to envision the changes in these children.
1452110581|5.0|This slim volume is a perfect gift for any cat lover.  Yes, you will find your cat in these pages of feline poetry written by poets with purrsonality.  Just fun!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Maybe things will be more clear as the game goes on but right now I have no idea what I should be doing or who I am fighting
B008B4KVS8|5.0|Great movie, great music, and great acting!<br /><br />The movie has a suspense-filled plot with so many twists, I was unsure who was on what side even after it was over.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have seen the Liam Neeson movie a hundred times always wanting to read the book.  SO glad I finally did!  There was a lot more philosophy than I had expected, but it enriched the characters so well that it became a vital part of them.  One thing that was frustrating was the lack of definitions for many of the words.  Even with a strong vocabulary, it was difficult to catch some of the intricacies due to the language.  Overall, an absolute thrill to read.  For anyone who enjoys a brilliant story where no detail could be spared, this is a great classic to pick up.
B006JSXYPA|2.0|I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed.  I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had.
B0086700CM|4.0|My daughter loves this game. She plays it on her Kindle Fire all the time. Are you kidding me, whats up with the word requirement??
B006LSZECO|3.0|Warning: somewhat of a spoiler.  I'll keep this short because I don't think this novel deserves a lot of my time. The author can write and tell a story - I'll give her that. I've read all three of her novels.  If you define a \\"page turner\\" as something you read on the exercise bike, not paying close attention and with no desire to ever read it again, they're page turners. Flynn gives us dark characters, twisty scenes, mindless entertainment. But at least her other novels offer somewhat multidimensional characters and some surprises. I found this one totally predictable and guessed where it was going even while rolling my eyes.
B008476HBM|4.0|I will not go as far as saying this is one of my favorites. However, it is a classic that demands respect and carries with it all the elements of a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Truly moving. I cried so hard and I just couldn't help it. The emotions ran through me. Through the chaos there is finally the well deserved bittersweet happy ending.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half!! It was so grabbing that I just couldn't put it down and just wanted to keep reading more! I stayed up super late just cause I wanted to know more. Kind of a dumb ending but definitely a must read.
B002361MLA|5.0|Thank you for the Kindle owner's lending program. I found this book among the lendable books without knowing how famous it was before.<br />My favorite part is \\"The power of choose\\" this answer my question throughly - why  7 years ago I chose unfit career field.<br />Mr. Tolle's explanation about \\"high degree consciousness\\" versus \\"conditional mind\\" give me new perspective and hope.<br />One of new year reading books.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am 9 years old and I absolutely loved this book. I like how the whole story was told be other people's side of view. August is very heartwarming in this book. It is so nice that Jack, Charlotte, Henry, Miles, and Amos was so nice to him. I spent all week reading this and I really truly enjoyed the book! Thank you, R. J. Palacio for this amazing book. :D
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I let my 4 year old play with this app and she ended up spending $20 on a bucket of jewels. Not cool! I deleted the app.
B00005NGAK|5.0|This show is performed outdoors in a London Park and the visual effects are stunning.  If you like Michael Flately, the dancers, singers, and performers, you will not be disappointed by this production.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book but it is to short but I still like the book<br /><br />Still it was to short
B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowling does a classical study in defining parental toxicity, its effect on teenage children and ruinous political policies beset with destructive self agendas.<br /><br />A polar opposite from the fantastical and heroic characters of Harry Potter, the plot and charcters of Casual Vacancy grip us with in~your~face reality.<br /><br />if you don't recognize these charcters and their impacts, youre not paying attention.<br /><br />Jan Dean, Honokaa, Hawaii
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Does more than just white light. Gives off a great red light for using at night in the cockpit - saves night vision.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|yes, there were some funny moments, but overall, it was a waste of time. Wasn't quite ready for a foul-mouthed teddy bear.
1891252089|4.0|This is a very practical yoga book but there are a couple of typos.I feel like if you pay over $20 for a book it should have no errors.
0394806220|5.0|This is one of the most fun books to read aloud ever!<br />There isn't really any \\"plot\\"; the main character is the titular Mr. Brown, who has not only the ability to make a great many noises, but the will to go around doing so.<br />Kids love the idea of a grown-up going around making animal noises, and many will join in the fun as you read it with them. Learning takes place without boredom!<br /><br />As with so many of Seuss's works, there is some deep pedagogical stuff going on beneath the playful surface. Take the word \\"Moo\\" in the title. Children who know that cows go \\"moo\\" don't have to be told that two o's together make an \\"oooooo\\" sound; many will see the cow, see the letter M followed by some letters, and unconsciously figure out that this is the sound \\"Moo\\"!<br />You can ignore all that if you like. It's a fun book that many children will enjoy having re-read to them until they can read it themselves, and what could be better?
B0096BIENY|5.0|Although a lot in Italian - this CD is the greatest.  great song choices  and versions  -  Superb sound. We listen to  it daily
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Django was unchained, but Samuel L. Jackson was \\"off the chain.\\" It is very easy to see why Samuel L. Jackson is one of the hardest working actors in the industry. He delivers every time. Mr. Jackson played the role of Stephen; Calvin Candie's trusted house slave, and took the \\"Uncle Tom\\" character to a whole new level in this movie. In fact, he may have stolen the show. I literally held my stomach and laughed out loud several times while watching Django. And, I wasn't the only one who was nearly falling out of the chair with laughter. There were so many funny scenes in this movie. Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) bounty hunting techniques; the conversation between Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) regarding Django (Jamie Fox) being allowed to stay in the big house; the hooded head \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" with Big Daddy (Don Johnson) and his crew; and Broomhilda's (Kerri Washington) ability to empty a glass of water while fainting were just a few of the many funny scenes in this movie.<br /><br />The entire cast was outstanding. Kudos to the cast for taking on a sensitive subject matter such as slavery and creating a movie that was poignant, thought provoking, dramatic, and hilariously funny.  In fact, I am not sure what genre this movie actually falls under. Although there were some gruesome scenes in the movie; that were difficult to watch, they do reflect many of the African American experiences during (and after) slavery. Only Quentin Tarantino could come up with such a poignant, yet hilariously funny movie.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|This is a must have for me  Had to replace the one I left in a rental car  Try Big Log while driving down A1A (Florida)
0316069434|5.0|The \\"Black Box\\" is a must read that is impossible to put down. Once again we are taken on another adventurous ride through the streets of Los Angeles with Detective Harry Bosch as he tries to uncover another murder mystery. Harry has been assigned the task of solving the mystery behind the murder of a freelance reporter; nick named \\"Snow White.\\" However, this \\"opened unsolved\\" just happens to be one of the cases that was initially assigned to Harry during the infamous 1992 Rodney King/Los Angeles riots (20 years ago). As Harry uncovers evidence and valuable information from key witnesses, he realizes that things are not always as they appear. To make matters worse, as Harry gets closer to connecting the dots of the murder mystery, he is faced with opposition from the higher ranks.  Although there is no high jingo involved in this case, there is a concern about the possibility of public outcry if Snow white's case gets solved before some of the other victim's of the 1992 riots. Since I am not a \\"book spoiler,\\" you will have to read the book for more details and to see how it ends.<br /><br />I will say that if you want to read a good murder mystery that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat; waiting for the other shoe to drop, then I recommend \\"The Black Box.\\" If you enjoy reading novels that are filled with mystery, suspense, and the thrill of the chase, then I recommend all of Mr. Connelly books.  All of Mr. Connelly's books are great page-turners. His books are so addictive that it is very easy to loose track of time while reading about the very memorable characters such as Harry Bosch, Mickey Haller, Rachel Walling, Terry McCaleb, and now Maddie Bosch. Mr. Connelly writes with such descriptive detail that it is very easy to visualize each scene as they play out in his novels. You almost feel like a third partner taking a car ride with Harry Bosch and Jerry Edgar, or Harry Bosch and David Chu as they travel through the streets of Los Angeles.  If you area fan of music, you will also enjoy how Mr. Connelly incorporates and associates specific music (i.e. jazz) and artists with the character's mood and case.<br /><br />There is just one caveat: Once you start reading books by Michael Connelly, you may find yourself doing pre-orders for his upcoming books.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I thought this book was a very well written book. One of the best I have ever read. The plot was very interesting and creative.
B00866JL96|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for my oldest Daughter. Very good product. I was very pleased and my Daughter was very happy.

B005LAIGSM|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for my oldest Daughter. Very good product. I was very pleased and my Daughter was very happy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written.  Every step of the way, it became harder to stop reading.  It keeps you constantly wondering what will happen next.  Can't wait to read the next two books!
B003YHSE7W|4.0|A worthy sequel to the original with some added characters that enhanced the series. Robert Downey plays the main character with just the right amount of dry humor.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy and read it in 2 weeks. You cannot put it down. Want to read more about Christian and Ana.
B00138H1MS|5.0|This album has proven to be one of the best I have.  It covers a great variety of his music and is very entertaining.  My 14 year old grandson thought it was really great for old music.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|It is a good book to have.<br />And thats it.<br /><br />I dont have any more to said about the this book.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love MLP but seriously. I have had it trying to buy gems in this game. I'm playing on my Kindle Fire and every time I try to purchase anything it processes for about 3 minutes and finally says the appstore is not responding. So thinking it just didn't process, I try it again. Still pops up with the same error message and the gems don't show up in the game. A couple days later I check my bank account where those charges have shown up! First time this happened I called Amazon and they refunded me saying that they'll only do it the one time. Now I tried making a purchase again SAME THING HAPPENED!  Is this some sort of scam??
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|Its just as good as all the other resident Evil movies! A little on the short side I felt like they kinda rushed through this movie a little bit but otherwise awesome!!!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Super 8 gives Spielburg a different corner of the sand box to play with pre-teen innocence pitted against adult indifference, callous martial bigotry  and a lonely, misunderstood space monster.  The special effects are good, specially so if you like train wrecks.  Some benign reference to drugs and alcohol but the real enemy is our own society, mainly in military uniforms.  There is violence, mostly directed at those deserving uniforms, but not pervasive or particularly graphic.  The main characters are substantial for the most part, dealing with loyalty, honor and an awakening sensitivity to the opposite sex.  This movie is really like another view of ET with a more menacing alien.
B00A757EFW|2.0|the directional controls are a bit wonky, making it difficult to go around corners and such.  i tried both the in-game control pad and the finger-swiping method.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|This movie was very entertaining for both kids and adults.  Excellent story and very funny.  Great family movie.  Highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|very entertaining  I cant wait for the next episode.  I was glad to be able to watch all those episodes at once
B003CYKCHW|2.0|I can't seem to find a driver that properly functions with my system, I'm on windows XP professional SP3 32-bit.<br /><br />Mouse occasionally jitters and moves on it's own, freshest drivers from the website don't help anything - actually manufactured by Mad CatZ I believe, which if I had realized prior to purchasing I wouldn't have done so - this company's hardware has always been B-Grade.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I decided to download Wool (#1) because it was free. I was immediately hooked and bought the omnibus. Just a great series.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|This is a good book for those who love the Halo series. I found it a bit watered down as a sci-fi / fantasy lover.
B000F3LXLW|5.0|I would write a really long and detailed review of this amazing book but what for? I mean, If you really want to know what its about, look it up on Wikipedia... or better yet, buy it and read it yourself. Although this book is short, its simply amazing and deals with so many issues. Enough said.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Game play is excellent on my Kindle Fire HD. I haven't had any of the issues stated on the other reviews. I also have the game on my HTC Thunderbolt and I like it on the kindle a lot better.  You do run out of energy but it's totally up to you if you want to spend real money. That's common in a lot of games now. This Game is great, I definitely recommend.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I got this book for free on sale and I love it! I'd recommend it to anyone and its a great read
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I found to be excelent. I remember reading this years ago and the story is still facinating. Reading on the Kindle FIre was very nice and portable, and you do not lose your place.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|Just saw this today.  The singing done by Hugh Jackman (who sings some of my favorite songs from the musical) and Russell Crow ruined the movie for me.  I understand that the director was going for realism.  However, this is first and foremost a movie based on the musical.  So, the singing is key.  Some of the actors did a good job.  However, as I've said before, Hugh Jackman (whom I love as an actor) and Russell Crowe (not so much), ruined the songs they sang.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this calculator. the display is really easy on the eyes and I like the way it functions.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Enjoyed the story, humor, and the great read. look forward to the next book. Loved the characters and their counterparts.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|We have purchased a lot of trucks over the past few years, and Bruder trucks really are the best. They are durable and heavy and a good size for 3-+ years. We like them because they are very functional and my son loves to play with garbage trucks that actually work. Shipping from Amazon was the fastest and very reliable. We found the best pricing at Amazon.............good luck to all u truck fans
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Best bang for your buck, came with, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD AND a digital copy cd!<br /><br />Well worth it, recommended to anyone who loves, The Lion King!
B006R4H5FG|3.0|This book was required for a class at Oregon State University and I ordered it for use in the class.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Perfect cover for throwing in a backpack or purse. Bought for my son to protect his new Kindle and he is already using to carry back and forth to work and home.
1609611543|3.0|Hmm...where to begin. I think I will start by saying who this book is good for. It's probably pretty obvious that if you are unhealthy, pre-diabetic, High VLDL, insulin resistant, that diet it where you start. Most likely you got this way because a number of reasons. You were genetically pre-disposed, you live a rather sedentary lifestyle, you eat too much fast food and sugary products, and you don't get enough sleep. No one cause, will make you this sick. Sure, Wheat can be to blame, but to come out and say Wheat is evil, and Wheat is toxic is somewhat misleading. I would say Wheat is probably less than 5-10% of the problem. Carbohydrates in general are the bigger problem, as well as all these other factors mentioned. How do you explain all the other people with perfectly good bloodwork, who eat Wheat 7 days a week, 365? Sure, some people have an intolerance towards Wheat or Gluten, but it's not universal.<br /><br />I think if you are healthy, then keep eating Wheat. I am already super healthy as it is, and eliminated all Wheat Products. I must say, I do feel better, but the lack of variety in my diet sucks! I now must have 2 cheat days a week where I can eat whatever I want. This book almost puts all the blame on Wheat, which is unfair. Genetics plays a much larger role. I say quit Wheat to lose weight, but total elimination is too boring. Pasta and Pizza once in awhile is a must for me to be happy!

The building combinations are endless and the pigs and birds are adorable and well-made.<br /><br />I'm really happy with my purchase.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I have had a few Kindles and covers before, but this cover is perfect for me.  Light weight - I did not wish for a bulky cover that added weight and it is washable. It holds the Kindle Fire snug and allows for easy access for controls and charging. I wanted a cover to protect my Kindle and this is it!
B004PAHZMC|5.0|We have enough Legos at our house to fill a room! I'm fanatical about keeping them organized, so we have several storage containers. We own two of this particular design and I love them! They are cute and can be used as a play mat as well. I love that my boys can tote them around! Now if I could just keep them from dumping the whole thing out on the floor... *sigh*<br /><br />I highly recommend this :)

B006CBSE86|5.0|I've listened to this cd prolly 5 - 6 times.  Catching new stuff with every listen.  I LOVE it already and bound to love it more with every listen.  So much going on in every song.  A great follow up to Dark Passion Play but not quite as good as that one.  Didn't expect it to be though.  DPP is one of the best cds ever released in my opinion. Thought I'd let ya know I've only been a fan since Dark Passion Play.  Buy this one!

1575666286|2.0|The book was ok. Its a long slow read,I agree with somethings in the book but most people would not be able to afford the methods that they suggest. It is sad though that this cant be practiced in the US.
0345803485|1.0|Every female I know (with the exception of two people) loved this book and I just don't understand WHY. I couldn't even read the whole thing. BUT, as an aspiring writer, I feel the need to thank the author for giving me confidence and hope. Because if people actually liked this catastrophe, maybe, just maybe, I've got a chance.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This sounds nuts, I Love the game - BUT . . . . I also think it has lots of problems.  Its fun and entertaining and challenging, but it has a lot of flaws that could easily be fixed if the designers chose to do it. It takes hours of waiting to accomplish anything. I started playing this game while recuperating from an illness.  I could play 10 or 15 minutes and then was done and had to wait for an egg or for a breeding. I never mind paying for the golds because the designers deserve recompense for their work. But I hated waiting long periods of time and wanted to use the golds to purchase expansions or items. The higher the level - the longer the wait.  That doesn't make sense. I think they put that in to make you buy golds to speed things up.  That is a lack of integrity imho. You can \\"gift\\" 3 golds a day and you should be able to earn or buy golds if you earn enough coins. There should be diversity in the challenges. Otherwise I imagine most people quit when they get to the upper levels. But still it is fun enough that I continued to play and purchase the golds.  Because it IS FUN.<br /><br />The other problem I had is its Best if NOT played on kindle for many reasons. So maybe my problem with the game is actually a problem with the kindle.  One - You don't get everything on the kindle that you get with other devices. So you can't really play fully or level up like you'd want. There was so much I would have been willing to spend golds but I can't access them.[[ASIN:B008OOYALE Dragon Story]] The worse thing that happened is my NEW kindle broke. It was still under warranty, and I got a replacement kindle. BUT after spending hours and loads of $$$ buying golds. I lost everything. I was at level 78 and had only played 2 months. IF I want to keep playing I need to start completely over. Amazon claims its a TEAM LAVA thing. I don't know . . . All I know is it is a great way for both TEAM LAVA and AMAZON to make more money without providing anything for it.
B00169N0BK|1.0|I was shocked when I tried it. there is a very subtle difference between before and after profiling.<br />I do not think it is worth this price.
0321885112|5.0|Sketchnote Handbook has really inspired me to get a sketchbook and some good pens and take more handwritten, creative notes!  The book was laid out beautifully and was easy to read and understand.  I loved the text font they used in the book besides the handwritten items from Mike. The book was well made, and I loved the cover material they used, it felt very comfortable in the hand.  The video that accompanied the book was terrific!  I LOVED watching Mike do his sketching! Overall a great book and video and thanks to Mike for bringing it to us newbies to Sketchnoting!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book.  It really kept you wondering what would happen next.  Definitely worth reading if you like suspense books.
031620157X|5.0|I purchased this book for my granddaughters.  We are reading it as a chapter book together each night.  A super read to share.  Just love it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading the Bible and with this I can enlarge the print so it is easier to read.  Thank Yiu.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|If you're looking for a book that will keep you on edge, this is the perfect one. You will wonder how everything comes about until the last page. A must read!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have just started the book but so far it appears to be very interesting, plus I can adjust the print size.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decide to read the book because my students love it and then they made a movie so I just wanted to check it out.  I was sucked into the storey immediately.  I couldn't put it down.  I tend to take a long time to finish a book, but I finished in 3 days.  Can't wait to read the next one!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun for Grandchildren.  They love it. would recommed to others. Good of you to give it away, Thank you much.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book. Really makes you think about relationships with God, animals, the elements, and oneself. Writer creates vivid pictures. Thoroughly enjoyed!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Did not come with way to get instructions. Time consuming, but challenging and graphics were very good. Can't beat the price!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|After reading The Son of Neptune, I waited a long year for this book and I had high hopes.  It was suspenseful and exciting with just enough humor and a little romance.  It starts with the Greek demigod from Camp Half-blood on their way to find Percy Jackson and two more demigod for their quest at Camp Jupiter. Percy and Annabeth are happily reunited.  But before they could make peace with the Roman demigod someone fires on the Roman camp.  They quickly leave on their quest during which they face many dangers and near death experiences. You will have to read it to find out more.  I will warn you though, it ends with the worst cliffhanger yet and if you can wait another year to read this and the house of Hades in a row, I would highly recommend it.  All in all this was an amazing book and even greater than I expected
B001OQCV6K|5.0|This joint arrived right on time, love it when things arrive when they're suppose to. I will undoubtedly be placing more and more orders in the near future
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard a lot about these books and I found them very well written and couldn't put them down.  The characters were well developed and each had their own distinguished personality.  The ending left you on a sort of cliffhanger, leaving you almost no choice but to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay as well.  I highly recommend this book and the rest of the series. I have enjoyed all of them and the Gregor the Overlander series by Suzanne  Collins that I read years ago.  All in all it wad a very good book and series.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was an amazing price for all 8 movies. I am totally satisfied with this purchases and my kids are very excited!!!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Mahjong is a very interesting game and this version has a story with it plus instructions that are very easy to follow, I like it.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This movie is one of my Christmas favorites. This DVD is great because it's two disc with lots of bonuses: comes with the classic black-and-white movie and a colorized version too. I'm a huge fan of the original movie with Maureen O'Hara and Edmund Gwenn - the writing is so good and very witty, I just love it! (I didn't care for the remake of this movie with Mara Wilson)<br /><br />I ordered direct from Amazon and you really can't beat the prices + shipping. When I ordered, they were offering free overnight shipping for Amazon Prime members, but they offered an alternative 2 day shipping plus bonus Amazon Instant Video credit. I chose the 2 day plus credit and still got my movies the next day! If you shop Amazon more than 3 times a year and you're not a Prime member you're missing out.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is my 3rd pair. I've been using these for work for years. They stay in place on on my head so much better than the in-ear type. They are durable and take alot of abuse. You can wear a beany or hearing protection over them easily.

B0001I55SS|4.0|bought this movie because of one of the lead actors in it and I enjoyed it, not an academy aware movie however
B00068TJM6|2.0|Pros: The watch is attractive and is comfortable. Both of these are qualitative descriptions so take them with a grain of salt.  The four circular numerical rings, the four faces and six hands gives the watch a busy but yet nicely detailed look.  I find the smallest numbers a bit of a challenge but at 54 years of age I can read them without glasses or contacts.<br /><br />Yes, it is heavy, but men's dress watches often are and should be in my opinion. For those with issues perhaps your wife/girlfriend can find you something lighter or let you use hers.  Come now get a gym membership.  What an embarrassing complaint.<br /><br />The locking design of the crown is most welcome.  I won't wear a watch with a stopwatch feature and no locking crown and have stopped wearing other watches because of repeatedly finding the stopwatch running.<br /><br />I have had the watch for years now and am an active person.  The watch has seen many hours of outdoor activities including advanced home repair.<br /><br />Note although the watch is advertised as one for an active lifestyle take care it not very durable.<br /><br />Cons:  Following up on the previous statement I have had to send the watch in for repair at least two and I believe three times.  The issues have been the stopwatch hand refusing to reset to 12:00 and the last time for the second hand falling off.  I have recently found the reset button not working but don't plan to return the watch a fourth time since I don't use the stopwatch and because I have other nice(r) watches.  None of my other watches including the Seikos have had these or really any issues.<br /><br />Although a Seiko fan I can not recommend this model due to the issues I have had and continue to have.  Nor would I buy another Seiko chronograph.  I gave it a two star rating because these problems should not be occurring however the repair facility has been great about quick turnaround on repairs and would receive five stars if they could.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I like the story and just wanted this kindle addition for my library.  Will probably not read it until next year.

B007N9FKCY|1.0|i can't find any instructions on how to play the game and i can't figure it out.  this message goes for all the apps that was free and some i paid for.  it is annoying.  so i don't use the game (any of the games)  the logical thing to have is instructions.  is there a book out there that gives instructions on the apps?
B00321GTJU|5.0|This is a must-see for everyone.  I cannot  believe the footage that they obtained.  Beautiful nature shots.  This makes us realize just how small we are in the universe.
1250006341|4.0|A great book that reveals so much about the making of Downton Abbey.  If you like the show as much as I do, I highly recommend this book.
B004I744AS|5.0|Filled with words and even games to play, links within help you find out even more about the word and related subjects. I was expecting a regular dictionary, but pleasantly surprised with the extras.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this popular history book. By approaching the presidency through the relationship these men have had with one another, the authors give a fresh perspective on well-known topics. The sadistic back-stabbing and outright treason in the Johnson / Nixon relationship alone is well worth the cover price.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I was disappointed as I had read this book before. It is a feel good story but the ending is predictable. Save your money.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|Only day two of using product and the edges started to fray.  I like the design though.  Need better edging.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I'm only part way so far, but it is one of the best books I've read. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a fine writer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definately a good read! Written from two perspectives, I like how these are separated by part 1 and 2 of the book. Captivating twists I did not see coming! A very thought provoking deep book. A look into the lives of those who seem completely normal outwards, but very disfunctional at a closer look!
B00932AA5G|5.0|I have always had a big interest in Scandinavian films. I don't often come across them in my neck of the woods, but almost always I end up loving their films. Once I saw the trailer for the Norwegian film Headhunters, based on the novel by the increasingly popular author Jo Nesbø, I just had a feeling I would love it.<br /><br />The film is introduced by its main character, Roger Brown (Askel Hennie), who gives us the insight into his life. One the outside, the relatively short man has a glamorous life complete with a fancy house, nice car, expensive suits, and a gorgeous wife (a breakout performance by newbie Synnøve Macody Lund). As they usually are, things are different behind the scenes for Roger. Aside from some issues with his marriage, Roger happens to also have the secret of being an art thief when he's not doing his day job as a corporate headhunter.<br /><br />Roger's wife, Diana, happens to own an art gallery. As fate would have it, an acquaintance of Diana's, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) tells her about a very rare painting he is in the possession of. Upon hearing of this, Roger decides this is his next mark. Roger, along with his accomplice Ove (Eivind Sander) coordinate the heist. The situation turns out to be more than what Roger bargained for when its discovered Clas is a former mercenary and a big wig of a tech company that makes GPS tracking devices.<br /><br />The film's sly sense of humor and charismatic lead immediately drew me into the picture, but I have to say once the action of the plot kicked in, I couldn't turn away. I honestly didn't expect the action the film had, and the several twists and turns it took. The movie just doesn't let up, but it's far more than just being about the action. The storyline is clever and exciting and the film does a great job of building on the characters and making us feel something for them.<br /><br />Headhunters is yet another example of how the Scandinavians are doing something so right that Hollywood can't seem to grasp. The movie was an exciting thriller while also having a well thought out plot and well written characters. What I really appreciated was the amount of dark humor the film had, which wasn't arbitrarily added in, it naturally added some comic relief without being turning the film into a farce. There's also the drama between the characters, especially Roger and Diana, that felt genuine and again built on our feelings towards the characters.<br /><br />This film is likely my favorite of the year. It had it all: crime, action, plot twists, and the pacing was perfect. The film looks great and has a cool style to it, but it manages to pull of being a stylish flick without showboating or coming off as being full of itself. Headhunters is certainly a serious film, but it's intelligent way of combining the many aforementioned traits keep it quite entertaining.<br />Source: criticnic.com 28 December 2012
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is so addictive I play every chance I get.  The graphics are amazing. I can't wait to see what each new level brings.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Prometheus was one of my most anticipated films of the year. The mysterious Ridley Scott project showed promise of being a modern sci-fi masterpiece while at the same time building off of the world created by a classic sci-fi masterpiece (Alien). Now, I won't go on pretending to be an Alien expert, it's been years since I've seen the original film and science fiction isn't my typical go-to genre. However, I love a creative and imaginative sci-fi flick when I do watch them, and Prometheus seemed like it had everything I was looking for.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly than the overall look and concept of the film, the initial reports of the film's cast had me intrigued long before I saw any images from the film itself. Noomi Rapace quickly became my favorite actress from her demanding performance in the Swedish The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and sequels. I've since sought out all her other work I could obtain in the States, and was only more in love. Her exposure in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was only a teaser for her U.S. film debut, the true test was her leading role as Elizabeth Shaw in the futuristic epic.<br /><br />Aside from Noomi, the rest of the cast would leave movie fans dying with excitement. The powerful Michael Fassbender and the always amazing Charlize Theron, along with a promising supporting cast offered much to look forward to. Needless to say, the film set its expectations fairly high, which usually always ends up in fan disappointment. But hype aside, I can honestly say I loved this film. I actually felt that my relative unfamiliarity with the Alien franchise gave me some benefit in enjoying the film, as I didn't put pressure on the film to live up to anything else. I took it in for what it was, and I think that's always the best thing to do when watching any movie.<br /><br />Aesthetically the world in the film is stunning. The barren wasteland of the far away planet our group of discoverers arrive on has a decrepit yet mystifying beauty to it. The space scenes are gorgeous as well, which are prime examples of how modern effects can be used efficiently. Then there are the \\"Engineers,\\" who are crafted with such beauty and eeriness. Every aspect of the film visually was spot on, which one can greatly appreciate when watching the Blu-ray. Visually speaking, the film is a work of art.<br /><br />But of course a film has to be more than eye candy. So does it truly deliver? The story for me was very interesting. Many questions are asked, and just as many left unanswered. Perhaps this is what frustrated some moviegoers, but that's something I can really appreciate about a film. Our main characters, doctors Shaw (Rapace) and Holloway (Marshall-Green) lead the voyage on which they seek answers to the origins of life. We're presented with images of ancient beings throughout the film, and our characters experience several events that only build up the questions and complexity in an otherwise straight-forward plot.<br /><br />One of the potential pitfalls the film fell victim was its urge to cut to the chase. After watching the Blu-ray, I dove into some of the special features. The commentary on several deleted scenes revealed while certain scenes were cut. These cut scenes added more dimension to the characters, made them seem more real and made us feel more connected to them. They were cut more or less to save time. This is the one aspect I felt held the film down. The mentally intriguing story, astounding visuals and superb cast were the building blocks for a truly amazing film. This is one of those films that could easily be near 3 hours long, and I wouldn't complain (such as with the Harry Potter films). That extra time dedicated to building on the characters gives the film that humanity that makes it more of an emotional experience than a titillating thrill ride.<br /><br />Putting that one aspect aside, this film was fantastic. Whenever a film comes with a huge hype surrounding it, it's bound to letmany down. It's tough to avoid the advertisements, articles and gossip about blockbusters like this, but the effort to do so pays off in terms of enjoying the movie. I loved Prometheus, and it really left me wanting more. I just hope for a possible extended, uncut version, and potentially even better, a sequel that can be as good as the original while making up for what this film left out.<br />Source: criticnic.com 5 December 2012

B004IK8Q86|5.0|Excellent! The English language as it's meant to be. Not the lazy, meretricious speech of our texting, tweeting youth of today.<br />I would wholly recommend this meaningful exploration into the social customs at a time before people felt compelled to report every trite activity in their daily lives as if anyone really cared.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Everything was perfect! Shipped on time, great condition, and an exciting movie. I actually bought it as a gift, so the condition was very important. I wasn't let down!
B009JBZH54|5.0|All three movies are great, and the book was a real nice addition to the pack. If all three were bought separate then the price would almost be double so that was a huge bonus.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very well written book about the origination of cells that are used for most scientific research. The author wrote it in a way that was easy to read and pulled the reader into the story.
1451695195|1.0|I received this book as a Christmas present. It is a bad premise and the doctor never gives us a reason to believe this book is not just a delusional state caused by the infection. Further he does not explain how one \\"sees\\" other dimensions. Not worth investing the time to read it. You can cut the time down by skimming the family BS.  Thankful I didn't put hard cash out for this travesty.  I am going to give it away so the next person won't contribute a royalty to the author. However, if you listened to the nightline program and some of the promos you wouldn't buy the book anyway. An Ecoli infection of the entire brain would indicate that this physician indeed has admitted what most do not, he has manure for brains.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got this on Cyber Monday for $3.99! Great deal on a gift was buying anyway! Kids have watched it everyday since receiving it!
159420229X|4.0|Foer does a great job entertaining while enlightening the reader. As a high school teacher, I was drawn in by statements early on in the book, such as \\"Buzan believes schools go about teaching all wrong. They pour vast amounts of information into students' heads, but don't teach them how to retain it. Memorizing has gotten a bad rap as a mindless way of holding onto facts just long enough to  pass the next exam.\\" (very similar to what I expound to my students regularly about the downfalls of cramming for tests), and he teases the reader throughout the book with hints that have you expecting some usable revelation of technique any moment, but ultimately he fails to reveal more than the hints. I cannot say that I did not like the book, because I did. I can only surmise that, like most movies produced for the big screen in the last 10 years, this was an opening for a future book that will, no doubt, reveal all that the reader had expected from Moonwalking With Einstein.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|It would only print one thing and then said I reach my limit and would not print any more. Useless!

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I loved this book and I just couldn't stop reading it. (Maybe that's why I finished in a day) I have enjoyed the whole series of books that Jeff Kinney has written. I gave this book a 4 star because it was interesting and exciting at all times. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because towards the end you can kind of predict everything that's going to happen. I am in the sixth grade and I started reading the books in 3rd and I am still reading them, so I recommend this series to people of all ages.
1476719071|5.0|I love this book!!!! Read it in a day and half and had to pick it back up and read it AGAIN! It is a perfect example that true love doesn't always happen perfectly...... Love, love, love it! I think a movie should be made from this book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very engrossing game!  Once I started playing I couldn't stop. The puzzles are both fun and challenging and the hidden object games are entertaining. The game also has an interesting story line.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really easy read. If you loved the first one this is better! I can't wait to read the next of the hunger games books.
1451688091|5.0|A great read that is informative and well written.  This is a side of the Lincoln administration I had not looked into before.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|After hearing so many good things about this movie, a few friends and I settled on the couch over the winter holidays to watch what he had hoped we be another great comedy along the lines of \\"Bring It On\\", \\"Mean Girls\\", and \\"Bridesmaids\\". Unfortunately, that's not what we watched.<br /><br />Yes, the storyline is tired. It has all been done before. The leadership of a singing group with high accolades is passed on and there is pressure to return once again to the stage at nationals, but this time win (Hello \\"Bring It On\\"). Of course, we have a misunderstood protagonist and she has a quirky, likeable love interest. However, I don't mind what vessle is used for a comedy. We watch comedies because we want to be entertained and laugh, right?<br /><br />But there weren't many laughs... I'm not going to make any friends when I tell you that the humor in this film appeals to the lowest minds in our society. Fat jokes, puking, making fun of lesbians, stereotyping Asians (and redoing the same joke about 5 times thoughout the movie). That is the caliber of humor in this movie and even that may have been fine if each joke wasn't crafted to smack the audience over the head with a 2 x 4 in order to make sure that they get it. There is a lot to be said for subtlety and cleverness when it comes to comedy (see \\"Modern Family\\").<br /><br />\\"Pitch Perfect\\" is a watered down \\"Road Trip\\". It's the same old 6th grade humor with slightly less disgusting potty humor and less sex in order to make it a little more wholesome and acceptable to the entire populace. By the other reviews, it clearly has succeeded, but if you appreciate witticisms, sarcasm, or irony in your humor, you'll be better served by something a little less juvenile.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I purchased this season for my brother n law as a christmas present. He loves the show. I've seen a few episodes and it seems pretty cool.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Miserables is the best musical ever. If you don't have a chance to see it in person, this dvd is just like being there.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Obviously if you loved the movie, or even the songs themselves, you should definitely own this version. The music is still just as emotional as on the screen. I am very happy with this purchase as a long time Les Mis fan and I know I love the styling of this CD.
0307987647|5.0|have watched both seasons on HBO and also have both seasons in DVD, but wanted a challenge, so I am doing them in audio, it's going to take a long time but as I said it's a challenge.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great app. fun to play. I' 'll buy more apps for on Rovio. I would suggest it to anyone. thanks
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was entertaining but pretty low bar. The humor was crude but the story line was enough to keep you watching. A lot of random cameos by actors which was fun. Otherwise glad I waited to see it on Amazon and glad it was a cheaper movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book! I felt every emotion Katniss felt. And I might have cried a little too, but still.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|- I personally chose this rating because it really helps me with the way I use words and it truly is a big help with my English language arts homework and class.<br />- what I like about the dictionary would be that they have lots of  stuff that helps any one with their use and choices of  words. what I dislike about it would be its choices and the limiting its words.<br />-I would recommend the dictionary  to anyone who would like to improve their  English.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I do every thing on creative and survival mode is awesome two they just need wolves to tame and also for animals to mate
B002O01I9Q|5.0|I picked this up after hearing Knopfler play the opening act for Bob Dylan (October 2012). While I was familiar with his Dire Straits work, and some of his solo work with Chet Atkins, I had never heard him with his own band. What a treat! This album is very representative of his current live act and definitely deserves 5 stars. Just get it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is very funny and keeps you reading it.  I can guarantee that it will be very hard to put this book down.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A very predictable mystery, and predictable very early.  I routinely stop reading him for a few years, and then get duped by a newspaper reivew.  Good research on the prison system process.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing!! It has everything you want in a book and much more. I just couldn't put it down and I'm wishing there was more. If you're looking for a great read... start here.
034553154X|5.0|Who could not like Song of Ice and Fire art?  It was a gift for my son and he loves it.
B00099BJ48|5.0|I ordered this for my grandson in France.  He was very happy with it and  watched it the very day it arrived.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|A little MIB mixed with The Fugitive for TLJ! If you like him, then this might be for you...the rest of the cast is weak and the story line is predictable.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Sent as a Christmas gift to son living in France.  He is a true Dylan fan who recently saw him in the Basque region.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|Unfortunately, this movie leaves you wondering things like \\"was that really true\\". Biographical films sometimes leave you craving more information but usually not from a basis of wondering if it was an accurate portrayal. Since J. Edgar Hoovers run in Washington spanned an incredible length of time its surely tough to pack everything in to a 2+ hour movie. For that, I give Clint credit for making the film interesting and inserting as many nuggets as possible. Thats why this gets 3 stars. Despite longing for a little more about various topics and despite how the movie jumps around in timeline the film is well done. The problem to me that really pulls the movie down in the end was that it ends up just being a relationship movie about J. Edgar and Clyde Tolson. That storyline gets so overplayed and it overwhelms the entire story.
B008KWHL6G|4.0|Just to recap, Pitchfork gave The Throes an 8.5, What the Toll Tells a 4.8, Two Gallants a 6.9, and The Bloom and the Blight a 5.5. In my opinion, What the Toll Tells is by far one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. Two Gallants have always been about telling a story in the form of song. The lyrics are unlike any you've ever heard and, for me, What the Toll Tells changed the way I looked at song writing forever. There hasn't been that much heart and emotion in a song since the days of Bob Dylan. The flak that they caught from \\"Long Summer Day\\" is null, as far as I'm concerned, listening to that poetry still sends chills down my spine (in a good, non-racist way).<br /><br />With all of that said, The Bloom and the Blight is a great album. Yes, it abandons those long, poetic and erratic drum beats and swinging guitar picking that made Two Gallants unique, but it still portrays their heartfelt expression of emotion. These songs are more structured with way more distortion. The lyrics are more repetitive, and the drum beats are more tight (Song of Songs comes to mind), but it still holds true to their frame of mind. \\"Halcyon Days\\" is a fantastic opener and sets the stage for some of my favorites such as \\"My Love Won't Wait,\\" \\"Ride Away,\\" and \\"Cradle Pyre.\\"<br /><br />Basically, if you've been following these guys since the days of What the Toll Tells and their self-titled album you might be surprised, but it'll be the kind of surprise that will soon be played as much as their earlier work.
B009KY1XI0|4.0|Eva Cassidy truly had the most beautiful voice. Who would have thought she could improve on standards like 'Over The Rainbow' and 'Imagine' to make her sound the definitive performance? This collection is a fine one, although they seem to have been squashed together on to a single CD. Would it not have been more fitting to hasve a double length CD? Some favourites have been omitted. I would have liked to hear 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' and 'American Tune'. Many other Cassidy fans will come up with other examples.<br /><br />I was also rather displeased at getting the CD in a tacky cardboard holder. I see now why there were two options, although Amazon did not point the difference.<br /><br />Naturally, I would give five stars for Eva's singing quality, but a star has to go for the reasons listed above.
B00005LOUP|5.0|This movie is really a classic.  My husband has watched this movie about 5 times since I got it.  it is really<br />one of his favorites.  Jim Carrey is a good actor, especially in this movie.  Thanks!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Nor quite finished but am enjooying it very much. Good to see all the familiar people along with some very good nedw ones. Will hate to see it end.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is another great Quell game. Challenging but relaxing too. It's also lovely . I appreciate a different game and this is. You actually feel like you spent time well, exercising your brain! Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|This movie is about a princess on a good will tour who has had enough pomp and decides to escape her responsibilities and rigid schedule to see and experience for herself how the common people live.  My favorite scene in the movie is when Gregory Peck puts his hand inside the Mouth of Truth [...] and pretends he can't get it out.  According to Hollywood legend, he really fooled and frightened Audrey, but they kept it in the movie.    Wonderful, bittersweet ending.  I enjoy and prefer watching onscreen characters take \\"the high road\\" instead of cheating or searching for loopholes.  Refreshing!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game and the one after it too. I use it on my Kindle Fire and have had no problems.<br />It is a beautiful, relaxing game but a challenge too. Will grow on you till you are addicted  Best to plaiy when you have lots of quiet time. It's fun to see if you can get through each game without using hints.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a great movie! Great romance!  If your a fan of Zac Efron this is one you want to add to your collection.  His movies get better and better every time he does one.  I would recommend this movie.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|One of the best movie that my kids liked..<br />It is also the best among the ice age series movies!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|You have to have the First Season then purchase the Second Season!  This came on time in the mail and I would recommend this.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you like Family Guy, you'll like this romantic comedy.  Quite funny albeit a little crude.  I selected the Unedited Directors cut for a little more raunch.  Fun!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I would recommend watching this movie!  I would recommend purchasing this movie.  It is one you will want to see.  The acting is very good in this movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Alot of nice ideas. and friendly people!! I think I will use this program a lot. I enjoy learning new ideas
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My son actually got me started watching these movies cause we both like zombie movies.  I would recommend watching the first season.  If you like zombie movies these are great to watch!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent acting and storytelling. If you are as sick of the crap this country puts out as I am, try looking across the pond. The Brits know how to put a show together. They don't use nudity and profanity as a substitute for actually having a good idea.
B003NS1JHY|5.0|This is a great movie!  I would recommend this purchase.  My son loves this movie!  This is a funny movie and has a great story.
1609611543|5.0|Really good information!  Everyone should read, it may change your thinking, attitude.  Great help for wheat sensitive & celiac persons.<br /><br />A very needed resource.  Thank you
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett is one of my favorite authors, however, I found the first half of the book did not hold my attention, but I'm glad I stuck with it, because the second half was OUTSTANDING! Looking forward to Book Three....
B005H0IW6W|5.0|My first CD I ever bought of this artist and would buy another but I am to picky.  The music arraingements are awesome and he has a wonderful voice.  My 7 yr. old grandson even likes him. I liked his duos also, specially Feliz Navidad.
B003SQVI54|4.0|Very funny... I've enjoyed each episode... Just keep playing one after another... I'm glad I discovered this crazy comedy and would recommend it to everyone...
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Saw Avengers (great movie!) so I had to go back and get the other movies that is out there for the characters in it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Best book ever! Its got me hooked to all his other book but I must say next time don't make it super depressing it makes us<br />think differently about life
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I saw this one first before watching the Avengers and loved it.  The special effects in the movie are great!
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Great Headphones, good sound. They get pretty warm, which is nice in the winter but not otherwise. No other problems though.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This movie is fiction but the characters and events are very realistic. The acting, decor, language are superb. No detectable errors in historyrical association of any kind. Lets face it, the Brits take the crown when it comes to decent entertainment.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have to admit I almost lost interest in the show after Season 5.  Season 6 was pretty good I thought (Edward James Olmos in a villainous role was kind of fun and I thought he did a good job).  But Season 7 has just been great and for so many reasons.  First of all there are lots of very poignant jewels of wisdom in Dexter's reflections on life and these ring true even for those who are not serial killers.  Second, they shifted the plot up in season 7 - it's not just Dexter against some new psycho, but rather Dexter in love with the new psycho, not to mention other interesting subplots, including one that develops in a big way and will lead us with great anticipation into the next season.  This anticipation for the next season was something I didn't experience after season 5.  But it's here in spades at the end of season 7!  OK, and finally, the last reason I like this show is that it's often darkly humorous.  Among other things, it's kind of funny bringing Sgt Doakes back into the picture - every time Doakes comes into the picture I just gotta laugh.. He's like a smaller version or Mr T, but on steroids!!!  I really started enjoying this show once I accepted it for what it is - a show!!  I don't demand perfect logic or beleivability in every scene, though I appreciate them when they're there.. but rather I am happy to enjoy the show in the same way I might enjoy a comic book.  It has that quality about it, and it doesn't make it any the less enjoyable.  Great screenplay writing in this season - very imaginative and creative and good on many levels.  Now let's see how far they can push it!  They've certainly crossed into new territory and seem to have backed themselves into a corner - well, that's what a good cliff-hanger's all about!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I loved the way this app delivers such accurate weather services.  Definitely more advanced than the other free weather apps.  Keep up the good work!
B005KDWUFA|3.0|The music and singing was easy to listen to but I have heard much better singing,the goup was ok though and was maybe expecting Mario Lanza,which they were not
B000IZ0KRK|1.0|for a Depressed person ... NOT A GOOD IDEA - make sure you check out this history on this before you rent - if you are not depressed - then it's perfect for you.
B001A4LYN2|2.0|Spoiler alert.<br /><br />There doesn't seem to be much point to this movie. It doesn't say that all businessmen are bad, it just depicts a misanthrope who becomes progressively more vicious.
B0034CNSFU|5.0|The man defined ROCK lloonngg LLOONNGG . Did he have take his fingers to a LUBE SHOP before preforming ?
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|I'm running a wireless network to the tv that has the Amazon App.I rented the movie for an extra dollar for HD. 90% of the movie was super blurry. I did not enjoy watching the movie as there was too much pixelation.<br /><br />I have no problem when I watch movies on Netflix on the same tv. I know that prior to ordering the movie it tells me that the movie might be shown in standard format but even then a standard format does not mean poor picture quality. I think I won't be paying for rentals anymore. I'll just stick to the free Prime movies.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have enjoyed Shanghai on our Mac for years, and now I can enjoy its sister Mahjong on my Kindle. Love it, love it, love it!
B0006J28BO|4.0|I bought this movie for my daughter.  I let my daughter chose the rating because she said it was a very good movie. And she would recommend this movie for anyone over 7. It truly is a great kids movie.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|What a great movie, ensemble and story! It kept the intensity through out the movie. Can't wait to read the novel as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have it on my phone and seeing it on a full screen made it even better to use on an everyday basis.
B000NYT1M6|1.0|I ordered this dump truck for my grandsons for Christmas.  It arrived the friday before and I wrapped. However, when the boys opened and went to play there was a part missing leaving the truck unable to what it was suppose to -dump. I called and was very quickly given instructions for returning thru UPS. I spoke with a young lady named Tessa who was very polite and helpful. Had the truck been in working order two little boys would be very busy.  It is a good looking truck. Would be more stars but due to being inoperable only 1.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great logic app that makes you think a bit.  I find it quite enjoyable for winding down.

B008K8VDPU|3.0|I was babysitting a 9-month old and this became my new saving grace. She was entertained and I was relieved. Soft music to my ears.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|I followed up a class reading of Dicken's A Christmas Carol with this version, and the first half of the movie was dead on; however the second half of the film diverged from the story significantly in some ways (tiny Scrooge); even so, I would not hesitate to show it again.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|I can't figure out why this book has such high reviews? The whole story was lacklustre. Very little build up and very little chemistry or emotion between the two main characters. I did manage to finish the story but it was a struggle. The author did a better job explaining about Richards childhood and forming his character than he did Minnie's. This was my first book by Courtney Milan and I don't know if I will try another.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Love it; love it; love it; love it; love it. Did I say how much I loved it? You'll laugh; you'll cry (tears of joy); you'll love it too.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Keine Abstürze des Spiels. Es wirk aufgeräumt mit guter Grafik und super Handling - alles was man sich wünscht. Werbung vertretbar und nicht störend.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Wish I could win more often, but still a very fun game to play!  I don't know why I don't get very many &quot;winning deals,&quot; it seems that there are only a certain #  of those available...but like I said, still very fun!!! (~:
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Really liked it! Great movie, if you like the show you will like the movie more.  Highly recommend watching it.
B001O7JHSE|4.0|American History X comes out as a film that will stick with you after watching it with it's great performances, great writing, and some very well thought out and realized characters, yet one can't but feel it missed the mark on a couple things that could have made the film more than what it is.<br /><br />To start off, the performance by Edward Norton is what really carries the movie by playing as Derek, a neo-nazi before and after his time in prison, and he is essentially the leader of a surprisingly large neo-nazi group in LA, which includes his young brother, his friends and his girlfriend. Of course, this group is very violent and filled with hate and serves as the focus in the film on how they react to their local community.<br /><br />Norton and his character really shine by despite being a man filled with irrational and misdirected hate he is able to bring up numerous great arguments and points, making him into an obviously intelligent person and less of a simple racist stereotype. Yet I had trouble believing in his shift of nature that occurs as the focus throughout most of the movie, where it seems to be less of a slow change and more of just because one or two convenient key events, which I felt, made the movie considerably less subtle and even impactful.<br /><br />I also felt that while still heavily invested in the characters and the events they find themselves in, it all felt a bit predictable. Once realizing the grim nature of the film, one will eventually start predicting the twists and turns before they even happen.<br /><br />Like many great movies, this one has many scenes be made into wonderfully tense and powerful. Often tense without the use of violence or something to that effect, just tense with the use of great writing and performances from the characters where the hostility towards one another could be cut with a knife.<br /><br />While not to degrade the movie, the only release for this movie on Blu-ray serves as very bare-bones, with theonly two special features being the trailer for the movie, and a short handful of deleted/extended scenes that are pretty good though. Yet the video and audio quality is pretty good, surprised to see the numerous black and white sections to look the best.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie as more of an emotional then intellectual look at modern racism in America.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack joyride is so fun.I've beaten it three times and it is not boring.I get lots of coins and the gadgets are AWESOME.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|The first thing that must be said,amongst all the other griping being levied at the band for not touring again after this 2007 show,is Thank You,Led Zeppelin,for releasing this concert at all! To not have put this film out for all to see would have been a great disservice to the musical community at large.A tragedy,one could say.Even though the passage of time has left the band a bit greyer of hair and maybe all those high pitched vocals aren't as attainable as they once were,this is a band firing on all cylinders and surrounded with love at the O2 Arena that night.The set list,albeit one leaning a bit too heavily on the more predictable catalog(Stairway,Rock and Roll) is a good cross-reference of Zep's best.The stand-out cut has got to be &#34;Kashmir&#34;,introduced towards the end of the show.It makes quite an impact with the generous bottom end keyboard notes supplying all of John Paul Jones bass melody lines.Thank god for updated recording technology which really gives the listener much more of an accurate representation of this band's sonic heaviness.<br />  The second thing that must be acknowledged is that, without the participation of Jason Bonham( filling in for his father John on drums),this whole project would never have come to such marvelous fruition.There are, no doubt, untold hundreds of drummers,both famous and unheard of,who could sit behind that drum kit and play all of the parts accurately and competently,but NO ONE could have brought as much spirit and intuitiveness and pride to the project as did Jason Bonham.He truly deserves MVP honors for his role in this concert,and,judging from his onstage reactions to the love that both the audience and the other band members were showing him,I am certain that he had a sense that nothing as incredible as this night might ever happen to him again.One can only hope that they bring it back again somewhere down the road.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This is one movie that I plan on watching many times. I saw it in theaters and knew I had to own it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a must read.  Once I started, I couldn't put it down!  Very intriguing concept and I can't wait to read more!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the auto finish. But the fact that it won't  really realize that you have<br /> lost the game is a little annoying. But just slightly. It's great for road trip time passing. I would recommend it to everyone who loves solitaire.  The only other thing is that it Doesn't  do the three cards at a time thing. Little monkey rule.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my all time favorite novels.  It is a phenomenal read and well worth downloading.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|You have to wonder why some people bought this... they complain they don't like Seth MacFarlane or Family Guy.. but the idiots bought the movie.  I loved this in the theaters and I love it now on my Kindle Fire.  Funny Funny Funny... childish... vulgar... of course... but you'd have to be an absolute idiot not to expect that...<br /><br />If you don't like Family Guy.. don't buy it... if you're not sure if you like Family Guy... don't buy it.. if you are sensitive... don't buy it... If you have a sense of humor... and sometimes laugh at a fart.. for god's sake buy it....
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I bought one of these for my husband, two sons, and a son-in law for Christmas. They all were very pleased with them. It is the type of item, if you get one of them for only one, you are in trouble........They are all &#34; Walking Dead &#34; fans.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Downloaded to my kindle and works well for my elementary age children. Bright colors, calm music and easy to understand. The object is to collect pets and care for them. When you do a good job of feeding/grooming etc. you earn earn coins. The coins are used to buy new pets, play-houses, radios, paintings etc. I would recommend this for parents wanting good - clean fun for children, both male and female aged 5-10 and the bonus is that there are NO commercials.

B00005JOHC|4.0|Chuck Lorre is a brilliant man; a complex but calm man who has realized that as the boss in a performing arts company he must remain calm and staid because almost no one else will, He got his start, as most of the Hollywood writing staff did, on Roseanne, where his writing skills were honed under the demands of a woman who planned out an entire series between season two and three.<br />Roseanne was making a plug for women's rights and it centered on the fact that women were capable of doing just about anything. Sadly, in the late 80'ws and early 90's the methods she used were by making men seem like idiots. John Goodman is not only a brilliant actor and a man who clearly wanted out of his  contract in season nine, managed to come across as a wonderful man; a feminist who refused to give up his maleness. Still, we watched Roseanne hit him in the head with a cast iron skillet one too many times. When Roseanna (who had a philosophy that any writer had one or two good season in him and then it was time to cut him loose- she was wrong) released Lorre, he went on to create Dharma and Greg, Becker, Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. Lorre manages to do well by surrounding himself with outstanding people and allowing them to do their jobs. There is plenty of laughter on the set and Charlie Sheen aside, there are no \\"stars\\" on his shows. The Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of ensemble work we haven't seen since Marta Kaufman and David Crane gave us \\"Friends.\\"<br /> Two and a Half Men is about two unmarried brothers. Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen), two years older, who has managed a career as a musician writing jingles for advertising- bringing in vast amounts of money, a house on Malibu Beach and an endless supply of single malt scotch. Alan (Jon Cryer) is an anal retentive chiropractor- not quite a doctor- who was kicked out of his home a la Felix Unger by his wife of twelve years named Judith.(Marin Hatch) They share custody of a boy, Jake (expertly played by Angus T. Jones) whp is lazy, fraqnk and has the typical locker room humor of a young adolescent. The premise- at first- was to see how an adolescent boy would co-exist with a single uncle who is living with a Peter Pan comp-lex, bringing in woman after woman foir meaningless one night stands, developing a reputation where by almost anywhere he goes woman are saying \\"Hi, Charlie\\" or \\"Charlie, you filthy creep! You ruined my life.\\"<br /> On the surface, Alan comes across as the better behaved of the two and we strongly suspect that Lorre intended this. However, Alan begins to make up for last time and despite the many jokes about Charlie thinking with his penis, we noticed that soon enough Alans penis was doing all of HIS thinking and at a substantially lower IQ than that of Charlie's. Aolan spends all of his time comp0laining about how easily things come to Charlie while he has had t5o dfight for every single failure in his life. What is left to us to see is that Charlie has just as many challenges and failures as Alan but has learned not to complain about them. His relaxed attitude serves him better than Alan's constant anxiety and explosive diarrhea. Still, it is often Charlie who gets a surprise trip to the Emergency room. Charlie is the one who's got a stalker and had his testicles super glued to his thighs. Charlie is the one who is a kind man and wants nothing more than kindness in return. Alan is unable to see this and thus feels great jealousy about the fact that he feels that he struggles and struggles, loses everything, while Charlie has gold falling from the sky.<br /> Alan wastes every opportunity he has. His second marriage comes about a year and a half after Judith has thrown him out and he ends up in a weekend long sex marathon with a girl whose body is spectacular and her very loe I.Q. somehow makes her even more sexy. She is enamored by Alan;s sweetness and doesn;lt mind that she is half his age. She struts around the house in a bikini, to thedelight of young Jakes and, during a foolish moment in Las Vegas, Alan marries her. Fifteen minutes later a single coin in the slot wins him a half million dollars and then four months after that she has thrown him out and he has eleven dollars left.;<br /> And Charlie is the fool?<br /> The show doesn't make any attempts to teach us lessons and this is nice. After all we wept through Family Ties, M*A*S*H*, Designing Women and even Roseanna, but it is nice to have a TV series where there is never any growth- a pure half hour of comedy.<br /> As each season passes we see that both men are destroyed by childhood issues stemming from a terrible mother played expertly by the clkassic Holland Taylor). The boys father died when they were swtill in elementary school by food poisoning of fish. \\"( I was a new housewife and learning to cook, \\": Said Evelyn- their mother, \\"How was I to know that fish couldn't be kept in a drawer? \\"<br /> Charlie contends that his father KNEW the fish was bad and he ate it anyway. Alan refuses to discuss it. After his death came a string of \\"Uncles\\" who helped to raise the boys. Alan became the type A child who did anything he could to please but never succeeded. Charlie simply began to drink and have indiscriminate sex. They endured boarding school, Charlie got out as fast as he could and Alan married a duplicate of his mother. Alan gets reamed for both Alimony and Child Support. He loses the house, all the money, the furniture and the car. Why? Because Charlie couldn't heolp himself and slept with, then dumped, Alan;s attorney.<br /> Similar episodes occurred with Jake's Karate teacher, den mother, fifth grade teacher and countless others.Charlie falls in love more often and Alan ends up in terrible situations because off his loud but stupid penis. (a true highlight is his venture into computer dating when Alison JAnney plays a date who leaves, saying good night to Charlie, explaining she has to get up for work and that Alan has turned into bed for the night. Charlie who is plagued by being in love with a ballet dancer who will be traveling, enters Alan's room to see him cuffed at fours in red stockings, arm gloves and leather corset and panties.<br /> Alison Janney is an excellent example of the remarkable guest stars that visit this show. Martin Sheen plays an emotionally unbalanced father of Charlie's stalker, Rose (perhaps the gem of the series), Robert Wagner plays the boys father and as a result of a fun conversation between Chuck Lorre and the creator of CSI, a switch of writing staffs occur creating a hysterical episode here and a wonderful CSI parody. CLoris Leachman  moves in next door, Sean Penn and Elvis Costello play themselves in a support group with Charlie. Martin Mull is a remarkable pharmacist trying to compete with the larger chains and copes by delving into the sample drawers. He pays three sets of alimony but not a cent of child support. It goes on and on.<br /> The gem of the series is Conchetta Ferrall who plays Berta, Charlie's housekeeper who does much more than keeps house. She is part of the family and her wit and wisdom is curt and cute. Nothing disgusts her (one morning after finding a bra abd panties on the kitchen table with the bananas and the butter says, \\"Good God, I'm workin;' for Caligula.\\" She's a good woman, the mother of a handful of failure girls for whom she'd face a meth chemist to extort $5,000 in pre-paid child support. She could have only five lines in a scene and still manage to steal it. The house can't run without Berta and she and Charlie have a strong relationship, well defined and honed over the course of many years.<br /> Okay. The writing is full of 8th grade fart jokes but they're cleverly written so that one must delve into intelligence to get the meaning. There's a great deal of gas, as a result of a 12 year old boy who will (and can) eat anything and has no shame. We have watched only up to season six and we suppose that there's not a soul in America who has not heard of the medical condition that crashed Charlie Sheen. We have not seen that final season as his illness took him down nor have we viewed any of the new seasons with the adorable and perpetually adolescent Ashton Kutcher. The series is approaching it';s 200tgh episode, something rarely seen in television so that there are 8 seasons before Mr Sheen's illness affects the show- if at all. We will revisit this subject when the time comes, but in the mean time, score this one as a way of understanding men- of making up for the men hating Roseanne and at looking at two emotionally damaged men and why. All the women in this series are depicted as equally damaged with the expception of Berta and Charlie's stalker. There is the regular appearance of a therapist- a [psychiatrist who still does therapy at $250 an hour and from time to time all two and a half men have sat with her. She played a phys ed teacher on Old Christine and now has a lead in the show Glee- the only actress in Hollywood taller than Alison Janney, she spends most of her scenes seated in her expensive chair making jokes at the expens fo Charlie or Alan and helping them to come to terms with what haunts them.<br /> Yes, it took us years to open our arms to Two and a half Men because at first, it appears to be arm-pit farts and network Pokys, but it is ever so much more. This is a good one for everyone and even more so for any man who has been under the control over the stronger sex.bed for the night.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really loved this book, and for many reasons. Mostly because of the little details, but I really liked the detail the author put into the Christmas characters.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I love this movies and Gary Cooper is amazing!  Being a History teacher I love to show this movie in the classroom!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved it! Couldn't put if down, and finished in one sitting. This book a has something that everyone can relate to in it, and in the end will inspire you to be present in life.
0312600844|2.0|If you are a white, affluent, mainstream American you might enjoy this novel. However, if you do not possess the aforementioned hallmarks of Western privilege, you might find Freedom rather offensive and insularly ethnocentric as Franzen relegates \\"others\\" to the peripheral of his white narrative. In addition, the fact that Franzen references/alludes to works by great writers such as; Leo Tolstoy, George Bernard Shaw, Henrik Ibsen, etc., makes you wish you were reading one of their works instead. It's kind of like listening to Justin Bieber sing about the Beatles, or having the words filet mignon seared into your hot dog.
B004SBQAL0|4.0|I read the book, \\"I Am Number Four,\\" and was excited to know there was a movie coming out.  I was quite surprised that the film did less than stellar box office, particularly since this was released during the Twilight craze, and it seemed that this film would appeal to that fanbase.  I was even more disappointed to learn that there appear to be no plans to release any sequels (last I heard anyway,) so I suppose we will have to be content with this one film.<br /><br />The film hews closely to the book, which is a good thing.  Alex Pettyfer is always nice to look at, but he typically acts with a somewhat blank expression.  This is not a problem for him here; after all, he's portraying an alien!  Teresa Palmer as Number 6 was just awesome.  I had not seen her before, but I can't imagine another actress in the role.  I'm thrilled to see she's got a huge slate of films lined up - we already know how well she handles action, but I'm ready to see what else she can do. I don't need to say much about Timothy Olyphant. He can do no wrong with me, and he was great as 4's guardian.<br /><br />The minor problems I had with the book were less of a problem on screen.  One character's seemingly out of the blue personality transplant seemed more believable in the film.  And near the end of the book, there seemed to be a constant string of: \\"Let's put 4 and 6 in some impossible situation, and then let's give them some magical tool to escape.  And repeat!\\"  Again, this just did not seem as noticeable and repetitive in the film.<br /><br />Special effects were adequate, and I think they were what could be expected from an untested first film of a potential franchise, without a huge budget.<br /><br />The blu-ray offers some nice special features.  I'm always happy to see some bloopers!
B00003CXI1|5.0|The movie is great, would recommend it to a friend. It arrived in excellent condition and on time as described. I would choose the seller that I bought this DVD from again.<br /><br />Robert Gaskill
B001992NUQ|5.0|Am I one of the few who was actually surprised by the ending of the movie?  When I first saw it years ago, I was blown away.  Watching it again on blu-ray was a wonderful treat. This film is a must have for even my meager blu-ray collection.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love the book just waiting for the 3book, loved the history behind every character. How they were strong enough to overcome their past.
B00ARAO720|4.0|A decent movie, thats energy packed. Good acting (all the character are in awesome bike riding shape).<br />The lead character is a hottie.
B000W91RUG|5.0|My daughter was more than excited to get this for Christmas. She's a huge fan of the show and specifically requested this as a Christmas gift.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|All Clint Eastwood's movies are great. The plot is good. The actors perfectly chosen for each role. Its a movie with a believable happy ending. Client Eastwood rocks!
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This game is really fun. It was exactly as advertised and I am glad that it was chosen as the spotlight free app.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted, will leave you laughing on the floor laughing. He is raunchy, perverted, and lacks any type of manners.<br />Cute movie.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Was an all right movie. You could guess what would happen next. Probably wouldn't need to watch it again. All right.
B00797MB0O|4.0|This movie is ok. I expected more because Charliez Thereon (i know I spelled her name wrong) is in it.<br />Interesting movie because I think we all know a crazy chic like the main character. (crazy, alcoholic, narcissistic, slut) LOL
B007MJSQSK|3.0|Was an all right movie. The kids didn't like it as much as we were expecting. Not as kid friendly.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Bought this for my sister for Christmas. She loved it. She's a little behind watching the show and doesn't have Showtime. She was thrilled to get this as a gift.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This works to keep my mind busy when I dont' want to think about real stuff.  It only freaks out occasionally which is a relief.  Great work!
B0091LS07E|5.0|This girl IS SOOOOOO on fire. She is matureing into the potential God has placed in her.i Listen with closed eyes and just feel the places she takes you
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Absolutely amazing to the point of being able to read the whole book in a matter of 3 hours easily...
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|This movie was cute and fun. The quality was great and I had no trouble with it at all. Definitely would recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought the book was amazing! The way the to are so different, yet they managed to fall for each other! And geez, Christian Grey..let's just say I think every man should have a little Grey in him
B004AQR29C|4.0|... and I did too. I know action movies like this aren't highly praised by most critics but for those of us in the real world, a good old fashioned butt-kicking action flick with a fun cast of characters is just plain fun.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Greg needs a date to the dance. He's lucky to have Rowley,his wingman, at his side. The wingman finds the perfect date, but steals the lady in the end.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|It was okay during the movie but now it is just annoying. Red, the color of my anger after listening to this more than once.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is an amazing sequel to the wonderful Hunger Games. It's full of a lot of plot twists and so action packed that it's almost impossible to put this book down. The ending wasn't my favorite however, but I'm sure the third book will more than make up for this cliffhanger ending.
B005MM02P4|5.0|Classic movie in blue ray.  Shipped quickly in standard packaging, no complaints. Not much else to say. Good movie, good price.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This is the only way to continue using Firewire hard drives on Mac Air. And it doubles the speed. I am glad I got it.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I would recommend this movie, especially to Alien fans.  Looking forward to the sequel or sequels if that is what the future holds.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is aacrate weather information delivered in an appealing way.  Love the vraphics snd options for checking the weater any where in the world!!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This was a nice period film exploring the life of prohibition in a rural county. Violence and bloodshed but still enjoyable.
B003Y6GJD4|4.0|Liked it as a thriller. Well crafted. My family wasn't crazy about its political message. The ending could have been better.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was great. I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down. I look forward to more stories.
0866119817|4.0|fast ship. Good book for my 8 year old son. He is a good reader and loves these Great Illustrated Classics.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Freezes up for no apparent reason, forcing me to wait until it unfreeze before. I can continue.  This is a disappointing purchase.
B008KE3960|2.0|I am having  a hard time trying to figure it out.  I will most likely try it at again later.
B004WJRJUE|4.0|Even remastered this cd still sounds raw ! Under the Blade has some great songs on it What You Dont Know is one of the best opening songs for a concert that Ive ever heard and TS used it just for that. Under the Blade, and others make for a great album and mark TS for what they were, which was a metal band. I recently had my 21 year old son with me on a 3 hour drive and played Under the Blade , You Cant Stop Rock n Roll, and Accepts Objection Overuled for him. He later called me and simply said nothing he had been listening to seemed like rock n roll anymore and he wanted to know just what in the heck I had him listening to.<br /><br />  It would be great if more young ones would go back and listen to the great rock and metal classics of the past, instead of vibrating their vehicles apart with big sound systems blasting out todays crap that they call music.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Love this game.  My grandson and I spend quite a bit of time playing it.  He likes to try and get more points than me.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|You want something deep? Track 29, Mother.<br /><br />Or maybe some adrenaline for your exercise? Tracks 20 & 21, Tennyson & Enquiry.<br /><br />The score for that scene in Shyfall that made you chuckle? &#34;Eject me, see if I care.&#34; Track 22, Breadcrumbs.<br /><br />The thing is, Thomas Newman takes the music for James Bond in a bold and enjoyable new direction much like David Arnold did after 1997.<br /><br />One caveat though. Adele's song is not in this album. You have to buy that one separately (which I did and I'm very happy).
B0055S348W|1.0|I downloaded this for kindle hd but it will not work properly can not get into menu and it will not read our list labels for gmail so if possible is like a refund I have this app on different device and it is working fine but it is through Google pay plz refund
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased a 4th gen IPad for my older child and a Kindle Fire for my younger this XMAS along with protective cases for both products.  The IPad received an Otterbox Defender Series Case and the Kindle a Lightweight Microshell Folio Case Cover.  The Otterbox was relatively difficult to install and while it included a screen protection film, it's also has a separate hard plastic screen cover which snaps on/off.  Without question, the Otterbox is extraordinarily durable and strong.  However, it's snap on/off screen cover tends to be set aside and not used effectively weakening its protective capability.<br /><br />The Kindle's case though was much easier to install and the folding screen cover - which is more durable than the Otterbox film alone - simply flips over making it much more likely to be used.  The net effect is a higher level of protection as the result of human behavior.  The Microshell Folio Cover's folding screen cover also forms a stand which is a real plus when viewing for long periods of time (e.g., watching a movie) as the Kindle, despites its small size, can become heavy.  Sure, the strap feature of this case helps hold it but at some point, you'll want to set it down. While the Microshell Folio Case Cover does not include a screen film layer for scratch protection as part of its system like the Otterbox, it can be added separately if desired.  Our position though is that it's not worth the side effects of a dull screen that is less responsive to touch.  This is a tradeoff I'm willing to make given the relatively low cost of the Kindle to begin with.<br /><br />Which protects better if you're comparing the two cases when used properly?  The Otterbox to be sure; however, it adds a lot of bulk and weight to the IPAD in the process.  However, in our case, the IPAD was 460% more expensive than the Kindle Fire which we felt warranted the additional level of protection given the rough life it'll likely receive going off to college.  Short of forcefully dropping the Kindle onto a very hard surface though, I think the Lightweight Microshell Folio Case Cover is more than adequate for the risk imposed at home.  So, given the functional benefits of the case, ease of use and installation, color selections and price, I don't think you can beat it.
030759565X|5.0|As a long-time follower of the Smitten Kitchen blog, I was thrilled when Deb announced that she was making a cookbook.  I waited impatiently for word on its availability, until just before this Christmas when I realized it had been released.  I added it to my Christmas list and was so excited to receive it as a gift.  I have always loved Deb's writing style - she writes creatively, but also with personality, which makes her cookbook stand out from others.  I was pleased to see that the majority of the recipes (all but 15 or so!) were not simply taken from her website (*ahem* Pioneer Woman), but were created especially for the book.  Photographs were beautiful, as expected.  Recipes are mouth-watering and I've already picked three of them to make for dinner this week!<br /><br />The only con?  As much of a sweets lover that I am, I found that between one third to one half of the book is sweet recipes.  I'd have preferred more entree recipes, myself.  Nonetheless, I still love the book and plan to use it often.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You'll get no complaints from me about book two. Can't wait to start number 3 and read the conclusion of this epic tale.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Not sure what to say.  Most people thinking of buying this know what they're getting.  If you aren't familiar with Bob Marley, this is a good introduction to him.
0061733199|5.0|Simply put, this book contains nearly everything one needs to know in a survival situation. The rest is common sense. But if you don't already have that, you're probably not going to be doing much surviving. No book will teach you common sense.
B0099G3I96|3.0|Music is good. Lyrics are mediocre at best. I hoped that No Doubt would mature a little bit, but Stefani is still writing about looking hot. At 40? Come on. This album confirms that her brother was the lyrical genius and Gwen just doesn't have it. Still, it's a fun album for background music.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I paid less than $10 for the cd and my hubby and I love it! other places wanted closer to $15 so I am glad that I got it from here.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because of the history and the fact that it gives me hope for the future of humanity- that we can stop killing each other based on silly differences such as race, religion, etc. Rather, that we can unite under a shared goal: survival.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I loved it. My friend told me I had to read it so I got it and instantly fell in love!!!!! I recommend this book to anyone.
B003XZ0WPM|3.0|It was just ok. Easy to watch, kids make believe movie. Wouldn't purchase it to keep though. A movie to pass the time is all.
B003MAOTP2|4.0|Good historical fiction with enough action to keep my husband engaged. Plenty of big names to peak his interest to watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well, i really love this game, but EVERY time i unlock a character and click back to the game it starts me COMPLETELY over and makes me restart the entire game...what's going on?
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Better than movie's i think by a long shot. Much more detailed. I should have read the book  before movie.
B008NW67E0|1.0|It generally takes me a while to get into an album and I just don't have the desire to go there.<br /><br />First one was great and then they released this one.  Why?<br /><br />The sound quality of the mastering job is abysmal.  Scratch that... unlistenable.  There is absolutely no reason to purchase anything more than the .mp3 version of this recording as the engineer obviously set everything to the max, turned on the limiter, and left to take a dump.  Not that the first recording wasn't compressed to within an inch of its life but there's no excuse for this.<br /><br />Follow up: HDTracks 24/96 version MUCH better than the CD.
0984999302|5.0|A clear and concise introduction to the startup game - It clearly identifies the difference between 'business as usual' management and startup management. The book is clearly laid out and each chapter has recommended actions and activities. I purchased 'Business Model Generation' as well and find the two books to work well together.<br /><br />The Startup Owner's Manual has stimulated a lot of constructive conversation between my co-found and I as well as concrete actions.<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone new to the startup space and keen for a crash course in entrepreneurialism.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this story and read it extra slowly, rereading many passages that resonated with my childhood memories of that time. I was especially happy that King didn't turn it into a supernatural gore fest, but treated the time with veneration and respect.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I purchased it for him because it was on his wish list.  I think he has collected all of them by now.
B009DH371K|4.0|Excellent Blu-ray.  The set list is not much different from \\"Wembley\\", but it's still full of surprises.  The fact that this was shot on film, not video sets it apart from other Queen concert videos with it's amazing picture.  The cutaways of the band members rattling around Budapest was an interesting little addition.  We also get to hear John Deacon speak, which is a fun bonus.<br /><br />  I'd recommend this to any Queen fan, or any fan of live music for that matter.  Queen prove that they're the best live act that's ever performed without inflatable pigs or giant video screens.  This is a perfect for fans of the band or for anyone looking to explore Queen's music.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was really good!! A great romance novel very easy to read couldn't put it down kept wanting to know what happened next
B000P0J0A6|4.0|Forget Ralphie, Jimmy Stewart or Charlie Brown.  If you are going to buy one Christmas movie, this is it.  Joe Dante balances horror, camp and comedy like few others can.  The animatronics still look great.  Just don't feed this movie after midnight.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Setting button config was easy... Adjusting the sensitivity took some time, maybe more than an hour... But once it wasdone, it felt like I was playing on a pc... Love it.<br /><br />Tip: getting a good mouse is key. I got the lg G500 and it works perfect!

B001F12J0C|5.0|thanks you for getting my product to me fast.  it was in great shape and my mother loves it !
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great light read, surprised me at some points. Finished in four hours, I couldn't put it down! Wish it was longer.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm not much of a reader....but I so couldn't put this book down!!! Can't wait to get started on the third one!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is hard to imagine a more convenient and user friendly tool - plus, it's free! ( the best things in life often are )
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was awesome I would recommend this book I really enjoyed it I wish the series would continue hope you will like it to
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like it a lot better than the one on my phone because the ads are much easier to skip.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every page. I was able to visually see in my mind how each page would've acted out. Definitely a really good book to read.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|We are looking for more quality TV/Movie time.<br />We don't go to the movies often because there aren't storylines anymore, just shootings and explosions.<br />The casting was good and it held our interests.
B00A757EFW|2.0|this is only a so so game. i didn't much care for it. I don't recommend it for anyone to buy.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I went into watching this movie thinking it was gonna be really stupid,which it was, stupidly funny! I have not laughed so hard in forever, and the old flashbacks to the 60 and 70's superheros was awesome. This is a greatmovie,meant for adults dont let the teddy bear fool you.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a very fun game that I can easily recommend to any one to play. And since it is free, try it!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|As always lee child grabs you and keeps you sucked in from the first paragraph. I love the reacher series and the ease of amazon having  them listed in the order written, the only thing I dislike is the books cost more on amazon than they do at walmart or other retailers, and when you buy a hard copy book you can share it. I would think electronic media books would be cheaper as there is no paper cost as well as binding ect.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I played all the other hungry shark games but this one has the most action. I was like wow. Because I can't stop playing the game
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is one of the more graphic violent reacher novels, I loved it. Lee child hits it out of the park. As always. If any flaw its thats each reacher book is so expensive and I would have thought being electronic media they would have been cheaper. Walmart carries the reacher books cheaper than amazon, but they dont always have all of them, especially when your trying to find them in order. So if you want the ease of them being in chronological order use amazon, if your just looking for a good affordable reacher book they are cheaper to have the actual hard copy fromwalmart then you then have the ability to share with someone else
B004TI5N38|3.0|Book was good. Like the new hero. Fast action. Good plot. Well written.<br />Like better than The Forgotten.  Peggy Garrett
B0094BB4TW|4.0|If you love facebook this is the app for it, there are some things that could be easier such as sharing a photo or tagging someone, someone would assume that the app could be streamlined for it,but overall it works well and hey its facebook right? anything is better than no facebook
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I first need to emphasize, I don't watch American Idol. I purchased this cd based only on hearing the song &#34;Home&#34; on ( of all things, commercials) and listening to the sample tracks from Amazon. I am not disappointed, and very impressed with his first cd. Phillip Phillips is very talented and deserves the favorable comparisons to DMB. I am looking forward to his next cd.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Written so well.<br />This book is highly relatable, in my opinion. It's written in a capitative way that makes you beg for more, and you also find yourself falling for the characters through their personal little quirks, humor and humanity.<br /><br />I completely see this book becoming one of the best movies of the century, and am extremely thrilled that they chose to actually make a movie about it.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who likes a good movie, but really feels they should be doing some more reading.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I could not put it down until I finished it.  I loved all of the characters.  So well written in dews you in and steals your heart.  Wish there was more to it!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Bought this for a HUGE fan of Barbra.  She sang from Florida to North Carolina along with this CD many , many times.  She loved it !
0345803485|4.0|I admit I haven't read anything like this since I was in college. Once I got over the fact that this was not meant to be a great piece of literature, I actually enjoyed this book, because somehow the characters just drew me in and it was hard to put it down. Keep in mind too that it is written in the voice of a 22 year old. And when was the last time you ran into a 22 year old who was wise and brilliant? I can't wait to read the 2nd and 3rd installment!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this in one day and I loved it and I can't wait til the next book comes out:)<br />!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great a bit gory at parts but over all a great read. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|True genius from beginning to end. A gorgeous, macabre but fun opera. I could watch it over and over again. Burton and Elfman are extraordinary talents.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is as old as the hills, but the e-version ramps it up a level.  It's a great time filler when I'm waiting for someone or something.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|And I would know, I've read literally hundreds of them. This TNG era timeline combined with the writers ability to tell a great story makes for one awesome novel.  The fact that he's written this entire trilogy quickly convinced me to purchase all three. I've just finished this one, book one, and am merely seconds away from starting book two. In David Mack, I trust.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Goin back to play some more! Really fun, the little story comic book makes you feel like your Indiana Jones.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't stop playing this game, it is very additive. I love this free game.  Have stopped playing angry Birds temporarily.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Seems well finished, does exactly what it says (video and sound) for my macbook air. A little pricey, but worth it.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|It was as I expected.  My case cover was more expensive, but I liked this one just as well.  Good value.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Excellent film, very well done. Definitely see if you're a fan of \\"Drive\\". And absolutely see if you're a fan if Tom Hardy. Insanely good performance.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|The best I love it more pop in it I would recommend this CD to anyone she's number 1 worldwide UK and so on the girl makes powerful music you just gotta love her
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint brings in another fabulous performance and proves he is one of the best directors in Hollywood.  Performances by Amy Adams and Justin TImberlake rounded out this movie making it enjoyable and heartwarming.  Great job guys!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Tapping feature makes the game go more quickly.  Wish there were more variations - types of solitaire, etc.  However, for a free app -- this is great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I highly recommend this book! I couldn't put it down at all. It's so good. The whole story is amazing
034580404X|5.0|I don't think I have to say much about the book. It's great!!! I got the whole trilogy. I couldn't  stop reading it.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This app is very informative, all in one easy to understand page. The background also adds a very nice touch
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The wolves need their eyes, and their coats to be the color of the dead tributes hair.  The action was good, however.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It is the best game played by angry birds creator I would definatly refer this game to all my friends and family
0345803507|4.0|Don't know what all the fuss was about. Difficult to believe this is what women crave or want in a relationship.  Maybe they were not aware if such activities. Read Joy of Sex
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to see it.  It was worth the wait.  Brad Pitt was so hilarious.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Came in on time for Christmas. Good quality material and hefty size. Expected to last for some time. Cost was worth it.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I really like the monster fights and the graphics are super cute and very crisp. however the game is constantly shutting itself down and rebooting when doing any game interaction. feels like this game was not made to run on a kindle fire :(
B009MO5G90|1.0|Horrible script to what could have been a smart and intelligent idea to move the series along. The action was really cheap and stilted. The CGI was not impressive and neither was the 3D. A few gratuitous 3D moments are in the movie (glasses or a knife being thrown at you) - but even those were really weak.<br /><br />Really a disappointment. I almost shut it off but I was already falling asleep and didn't feel like reaching for the remote ...
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Have used non-pro version for a while. So far not sure if the pro is much better, but no ads [always a good thing].<br />5 stars if the ability to schedule recordings is added.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Good book with graphic detail...the end leaving you wondering what's next.....would have  been great to read about Corrine getting the boot.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite dramas to watch! Lots of surprises and good characters. I'm excited to watch more and see how the series turns out!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase.  I'm not sure if I purchased it for my granddaughter or my daughter and myself or all 3.  This was exactly what I wanted.  There were no problems with this purchase, price, quality, or time.
B006YC74E8|3.0|i was also dissapointed that I had to download an app for the camera to work and you can use it like a real camera but the app works fine
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who can read that can take in some drastic parts. I got really interested in this book from chapter on  I was hooked couldn't stop reading and then I found another book that I couldn't stop reading forcing me to put down this one and when I came back I was determined to finished it took me nine hours of interrupted reading to finish but I'm glad I did.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this, and have loaned the books out to many friends! I really enjoyed the back story, it kept me reading more than the ovbious reasons.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|I really like this movie! It had lots of great dancing but I don't really like the lead female character all that much. I'm not sure if it's just me who didn't like her acting but she is a phenomenal dancer.
B0086700CM|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game! The graphics are great on the kindle fire HD I would recomend this game to a friend.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love Fat Amy...err Fat Patricia. She and Jesse make this movie! And the singing is great so whats not to like. Definitely recommend this!
0553801473|5.0|This book, like the 4 others in the series, is highly readable and grabs one's attention.  Some familiar characters return, along with new ones in a complexity of subplots.  Not as captivating to me as books 1 and 2, but certainly worth reading.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I like the classic google better than this app. I find the format of this app confusing and not at all user friendly.
B009EV7GF8|5.0|On her last record Animal and Cannibal EP, Ke$ha explored the dance-pop and electropop genres, while on this album she delves into a more electronic rock and pop rock sound thanks to the help of rock and roll legend Iggy Pop. Ke$ha's latest album Warrior is full of heavy drum beats, shredding guitars, combined with a dance-oriented pop sound. Here are some song reviews:<br /><br />1. \\"Warrior\\" (8/10) - This is an amazing pop rock song and the perfect album opener.<br /><br />2. \\"Die Young\\" (9/10) - The album's lead single. Its a great dance-pop/electropop song that was the perfect choice to mark the return of Ke$ha after an indefinite hiatus.<br /><br />3. \\"C'Mon\\" (10/10) - The album's second single. It has a really good beat, catchy lyrics and is Ke$ha at her best.<br /><br />4. \\"Thinking of You\\" - When I read the title, I thought it was going to be a ballad, but I was wrong. It's a hardcore pop rock song that doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />5. \\"Crazy Kids\\" (10/10) - One of the album's many gems. This is a really great song and I love the whistling at the beginning of the song (so creative). It also shows off Ke$ha's rapping skills. This song should be released as a single ASAP.<br /><br />6. \\"Wherever You Are\\" (7/10) - An okay song. It's basically a love song set to uptempo dance-pop/electropop beats. It's not the best album cut, but it's also not the worst.<br /><br />7. \\"Dirty Love\\" (featuring Iggy Pop) [8/10] - One of the album's many gems. It's a sexy pop rock song about hooking up with a guy and getting his \\"dirty love\\" (and I know you know what I mean).<br /><br />8. \\"Wonderland\\" (10/10) - Another gem. After all of the upbeat songs, it's time to cool down with a midtempo soft rock song that's about looking back on your life and reminiscing. Another should-be single.<br /><br />9. \\"Only Wanna Dance with You\\" (7/10) - A mediocre song. Its about saying that Ke$ha doesn't want to dance with anyone else but the object of her affection.<br /><br />10. \\"Supernatural\\" (8/10) - Another gem and another should-be single.<br /><br />11. \\"All That Matters (The Beautiful Life)\\" (9/10) - A great dance-pop/electropop song. It's sort of like \\"C'Mon\\", but it's a lot more wild. Another should-be single.<br /><br />12. \\"Love Into the Light\\" (8/10) - The album's second ballad. The song talks about coming out of the dark and into the light and letting all of that negativity wash away in the process.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />13. \\"Last Goodbye\\" (7/10) - Like \\"Wherever You Are\\", it's a ballad set to uptempo beats and is about breaking up with your love interest. This track isn't necessarily one I would have on repeat, but I guess it's okay.<br /><br />14. \\"Gold Trans Am\\" (8/10) - It's a hardcore pop rock song about having sex in a car.<br /><br />15. \\"Out Alive\\" (9/10) - This is probably the most energetic song on the album.<br /><br />16. \\"Past Lives\\" (10/10) - The best song on the album...hands down!!! It was the perfect closer. It's about you thinking that your relationship with your lover occurred in several of your past lives and thinking that no matter how many times you die and are reborn into a new body, your love will still exist.<br /><br />This album also shows us that Ke$ha has grown and matured. I recommend this album to all Kesha fans (hardcore and casual), as well as anyone who loves to rock and roll. Ke$ha, if you reading this review, this was a smart career move and I can't wait to see what you have in store for us next. Keep up the good effort.
0394721772|5.0|Not much to say here, Julia Child is a legend.  This book is all the recipes she wanted to publish in her first book.  The publisher wouldn't allow it, plus the book would have been too big to use in the kitchen.  Get volume 2 if you love the food in volume 1.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|If I had to describe this album in one word it would be... WOW!!! Christina Aguilera's latest album Lotus, I believe is her best work since Back to Basics. It's full of hot, dancey songs and powerful, soulful ballads. Whoever co-writes these songs with Christina and does the mixing is a genius. This is definitely an improvement over her previous album Bionic. The dance songs on here are catchy, well-produced (not overproduced), amazing, hot and sassy and the ballads are moving, powerful, touching and amazing as well. I rank all 13 original tracks and the four other bonus tracks that are on the deluxe edition five stars. If you love Christina, then you will love her new album. This album is a grade A in my book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would give this book a million stars if I could. I am seriously in love with it. I want someone to make a movie out of this book! I'VE READ IT TWICE!!! LOVE!!!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Not as good as previous Bourne Legacy movies, but it is a good action movie. It is a bid slower than other Bourne Legacy movies, but I will recommend it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Lots of fun for the grandkids and myself.  Now just need to get better than they are! Wish me luck.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I had a difficult time finding this specific season in stores. Glad you were able to help me out in finishing up the series
B008C40218|5.0|These guys have created their own niche in the music market. Lead with beautiful melodies and and interesting harmonic changes, these guys are awesome. If you love los lobos or the Iguanas...you should add this album and their others to your collection.
B00000J0O2|5.0|I will continue to buy C3906A Cartridge from you only.  It is a perfect suite to my Laser printer.  That is why in enjoy shopping on Amason.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I have over 1000 dvd collection and this one has the worst quality. It was blurry and yellowish all throughout the film. It seemed like a bootleg copy. I'm so disappointed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game involves strategy, planning and good for a variety of ages.  The game board differs each game so it's hard to get bored.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|It's funny for the first 45 minutes, then recycles the same old gags and gets tiresome.  So what if you can recognize the Griffin family in the voices.<br />Not recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really like this game it is very easy to do ! I baby sit and the kids I watch are 4 and  up and they all like to play
B007IXWKUK|4.0|What an ending...can't wait to read the next one. The author really knows how to keep the reader interested. Loved it
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Kindle version must have worked out many problems listed in the past reviews.  My son has the Nook version and it is poor and glitches all the time.<br /><br />There are still issues with visiting friends but I haven't had to restart Kindle but once.  Fun but takes a long time without purchasing coin or acorns. Free doesn't always mean free.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Very nice look to it, elegent design. Shipped quite nicely and it is totally worth the price. I love the simplicity of it.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|This was a good movie-it was a Christmas gift for a family member. Loved the old Dark Shadows series on TV!
B008M721MS|5.0|I love my kindle fire hd. it's exactly what I need for school and enjoying my kids couldn't have gotten one at a better time
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Such a great read. Really makes you think of all that we take advantage of. Such an inspiring book, I loved it!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|?????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????? Huh and yellow card is this really good for all your friends and family members who are never getting back together again and family members to the camera and a question that has been the time to time for all your own project
B000000OU0|1.0|Ordered the \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" cd and it did deliver as scheduled. However, the cd was cracked, really nasty finger prints, smudge marks etc all over the cd. It did not even play past the 5th track.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|was good but could be a little more districtive on the characters and their personality but all in all it was great
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen and watch her everyday. She is the only comedian that I can laugh at all her jokes because they aren't vulgar and they don't put anyone down. However, I didn't think the book was amazing and I wasn't laughing the whole time. It seemed like there were chapters that she wrote just because she had to meet a certain amount of chapters. It was fun at times, but I won't read it again. I'm glad I only bought it for $2.00.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|What a Great book love the story and the events that happened. I Can't wait to read the next book.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|My boys love the show and of course they love to have the real Chuggington trains as well - fit the standard wood tracks - Perfect!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An inappropriate and yet enjoyable story. I can't wait to start the second book in the series. I will definitely read again!
1439170916|5.0|Studying oncology for a MS degree, they made this book required reading for the class. Initially I thought the book was going to be written at a level far below my current understanding but I was incorrect in my assumptions. The book it very well written and provides a great insight into the early and modern days of cancer treatment and research. The author gives an excellent explanation of some complicated concepts that make it easy for everyone to understand.<br /><br />I've loaned this book out to a few co-workers (not in oncology) and they all said it was one of the most interesting books they've read. For patients, doctors, practitioners, students, anyone...this is a really good book to get a broad understanding of cancer and the history behind it, as well as some ideas on where treatment is headed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book is awesome!!!!!!!!!<br />Yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay
B00AECGQF2|5.0|i played the first toca hair salon once and was disapointed it wasnt on my kindle so i was soooo happy when they got it :) this app is rlly fun! it is fit for any age and is worth the money. i have had no problems with it and i can play with it for hours and not be bored :) you can even save the cool hairdos! if you are reading this, buy the app RIGHT NOW because its so fun :) i love it!
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I am a big Clint Eastwood fan but this movie felt flat to me. It was way too predictable and Clint is once again cast as a grumpy old man. This could have been a lot better. I won't be watching this one again.
B004GYY714|5.0|It works beautifully on my Kindle Fire HD. Even though I had more than one person say it couldn't be done, I found Tunein via a recommendation, downloaded it and whala! I can receive the stations I love.  :&#62;)  Lovila HansenHill
B009A9BF5G|2.0|I saw the concert live in Philly - and I was excited to get a DVD that captured the concert ... But this DVD is a big disappointment. The cuts are so excessive that one gets a headache from watching it. The music is great as is the commentary from the band. But why is it all mixed together and why different venues - instead of having one concert from start to finish is difficult to understand.<br /><br />Their first concert DVD is so much better ... Maybe next time the find a better producer ...<br /><br />Don't buy this one - except you are a hardcore Coldplay fan who has to have all their CD's and DVD's ... But even then consider hard before you spend the money.
0316228532|1.0|Basically, Rowling must have been just trying too hard to put out a \\"grownup\\" book. If you take out the F-word, the tome would be 200 pages shorter. The characters are unlikable and the situation too mundane to be of any interest. Too bad.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Not only do I play her music every day; I begin each semester of college classes with .the song &#34; Full of Wonder.&#34;  Many students say that it inspires them to make it through the year.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am firmly in the camp of those reviewers who've said \\"This is the best hard sci-fi I've read in a looong while\\". Got it as a bedtime read - finally had to surrender to sleep at something after 2am. And was right back on it first thing the next morning (thank goodness for the holidays).<br /><br />Mixes the best of the HW Bush era SEI program with Zubrin's Mars Direct. Takes the dry details & brings them pulse-poundingly(is that a word? even hyphenated?) to life.<br /><br />One of the best 99 cent books out there. I'll definitely be looking for more from Andy Weir!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Instead of downloading, I bought the CD since every song is memorable and worth haring numerous times.<br />They SHOULD win a Grammy!!!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|The original Packman game was faily easy with the joy stick.  This game uses the touch screen. During play, I tend to put pressure on the joy stick; however,, if I go past the range of the touch screen joy stick, the stick goes to neutral.  I am having a great time relearning the game sith control.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Loved all the music, I just wish it had more of the songs on it, such as &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#34; and the second &#34;Look Down.&#34; Hopefully they release the full soundtrack soon!
B001HN694K|3.0|The story is okay but not one of his better roles.  Recommend for young adults that want to be entertained
B002FOQY2M|5.0|This album has a very playful spirit to it.  The lyrics are &#34;fun&#34; and sincere and the songs are anything but routine.  One of my favorite albums and bands in several years.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series so far. Can't wait for season 3 to air in the US. Very nicely done
B006M4RN3U|4.0|The good songs on this album are the best Fun has done.  As an album, I like the first Fun album better...the collection is more satisfying and a little more undeveloped (in a good way).  This one seems a little more produced and his still a good album on its own, if you had not heard the first one you would probably like this one at a 5 star rating.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|love love love it whoop whoop whoop whoop whopped whoooooppppp cutest ga.e cute pets cute things cute shops cute town cute ponies cute horses
0451232852|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I got completely lost in the book and read until I finished it!  I also own the second book of the trilogy and can hardly wait until the third book comes out!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Never a dull challenge!! It passes the time and then some. I would suggest this for all who own the Kindle Fire HD
B000YDCFRE|5.0|A well constructed boot that has a classic look. They look great with jeans and very comfortable. Only recommendation is go a full size smaller than what you normally wear.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This is the 2D disk included in the Real3D package that I ordered. It works fine of course but I like my 3D disc better.
0316789798|4.0|My 4 year old was able to start right away on some of the simpler drawings. She was drawings worms and birds that actually looked like worms and birds within a few hours. The only difficulty is that some of the first shapes are tiny, which is difficult for a small child, just learning to write, to master.
B001F12J48|3.0|I really thought I was getting Real3D such as in the movies but was shocked to see it used paper red and blue glasses!<br />The 2D was fine though and the movie was 5 star in story and content. However I was disappointed that the 3D was the old 50's<br />style.
030759565X|5.0|I have been visiting the Smitten Kitchen blog for awhile now so when I noticed Deb had a new cookbook out I immediately ordered it from Amazon.  It came quickly much to my pleasure.  How many great things can I say about this cookbook?  1) The recipes are all insanely good.  She doesn't publish a recipe unless it's truly worthy. 2) Each recipe has pictures!  She takes them herself and they're great.  If you're like me and like to see if you're food is on track with the recipe then these pictures are priceless.  3) She not only lists ingredients in cups and tablespoons, but also in grams so I can use my digital kitchen scale and only dirty one bowl.  4) She has a personal story for each recipe which I find thoroughly interesting and makes me eager to try the recipe even more.  5) If you lose the jacket cover the hardback is printed to still look appealing 6) It lays flat when you open it.  7) She has breakfast, salads, sandwiches, vegetarian entrees, meat/fish entrees, many desserts and even a few appetizers--what more could you want?  Be forewarned there are more dessert recipes than entree recipes, but that fits me just fine.  8)Also worth noting is these aren't your average recipes.  She takes her own creative spin on tried and true recipes, making them even better.  They're not the same old recipe you see time and again cooked by someone different.  They are unique and exciting recipes you will be eager to try.  Spice up your repertoire!<br /><br />The only thing I wish it had was the length of time expected for each recipe.  It doesn't have this feature so I have to be sure to read the whole recipe through to see if I have enough time to complete it (they're not quick 15 minute recipes).  As others have mentioned, the recipes in the cookbook are not on her blog.  There are a few overlaps, but the majority are brand spanking new recipes-which excites me.  I didn't need a book form of what is already on the blog, because let's face it, I can just go to my computerfor her other hundreds of recipes, no need to take up shelf space.  This is the type of cookbook I will try most everything in it, make notes in it and pass it down to my children when I am old and grey.  Someone else mentioned they found the format inconvenient because the recipes mostly span 2 or 3 pages and you have to flip the the page back to get to the ingredient list.  Sure, but it's not a deal breaker for me.  I often cut the recipes in half, so I have the ingredient list on a separate paper anyway.  I personally love the detail Deb gives for each recipe and would rather 2 or 3 pages instead of 1 page of condensed directions.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this cookbook more.  I  have already told a friend about it.  She bought it right away and loves it too.  My husband can't stop raving about all the meals and desserts I make from this cookbook.  It's the best cookbook I've ever owned!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|So much fun! More fun (and more addictive) than any other the other A.B iterations, IMO. If you enjoy the other A.B. games, and you're a Star Wars fan, you'll have a blast with this.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you like Wes...you'll love this movie.<br /><br />Characters all feel familiar (not a bad thing), and the formula is perfect.  Laughs were had, and everyone felt great after it was over.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Kinda scary, really! This little dude gets it right almost every time, as long as you are honest with your answers. Pretty amazing.<br />But after 20 or so games, you get tired of it, even though you're amazed at how he gets it right all the time.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I was very pleased to have purchased this movie at this price. Especially the fact that its the blue-ray version. The price could not be beat, so I purchased this movie without hesitation. Thanks for the great online experience!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Such a sweet up and down love story didn't want to.put it down!  One of the better love stories I've read recently well worth the read.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|I was happy to purchase the blue-ray version of Iron Man II. My family really enjoys marvels action movies and for the price this was a steal. Thanks so much!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great ensemble cast, sweet story, perfect line (&#34;Everything will be all right in the end... if it's not all right, then it's not yet the end.&#34;).
B0034G4P8A|5.0|My family really enjoyed this movie when we watched it at the movies. For that matter, I was very pleased to find the blue-ray version of this film. The price was great too, and the overall shopping experience was exceptional. Thank again!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Hated this movie!  I remember 20 years' worth of entertaining, sometimes darkly humorous, edgy Batman movies that I've loved.  Where did this come from?  And really... Batman needs to get over the &#34;I'm a tough guy so I've got to talk like I have a bad cigar hangover to cover up the Christian Bale lisp&#34; - and what was it with Bain's voice?  All too distracting and not entertaining at all.  Seriously, kid climbs out of a pit and becomes World Terror #1 (or #2 - your interpretation)?  Morgan Freeman's and Michael Caine's parts were even reduced to gratuitous throwbacks.  Ugh!  No more, please.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I am really enjoying this game. I play on the original Kindle Fire. The game plays very smoothly with no crashes or glitches. The screens are visually gorgeous. I am on level 12 and I can't wait to explore more of the academy. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is, for me, it is super easy. I continue to play because it has a decent story line and, as I said previously, beautiful graphics!  Worth the money. if you want a fun, relaxing, beautiful game this is for you! C'mon,  it's only &cent;99.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Beautiful and touching. It brought me to tears.This is something I will definitely re-read. The only thing I have left to say is wow
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Not a too predictable movie with good humor in it for all ages. Must-watch movie for anyone who likes animated films.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book! This is a classic Christmas story that never gets old. A must read every year at Christmas-time.
B00999DFP0|5.0|The extras are very good, with behind the scenes tours, and bloopers from each season.  It's nice to see the whole show, including little pieces that are cut out now because of commercials.  Very enjoyable!
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Great story. well written. Kept me interested though out. Would like to read more by her. Hard to keep me from knowing the ending but this did well.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|This young lady has an excellent voice.  Lot of fun to listen to.  Will buy more of her music in the future.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I enjoy playing my little pony, download it for my daughter but I play it more than what she does, if you like smurf village you would like this one.
0064400557|5.0|Grandson loved the the book. Great product, timely shipment.  Nicer than what i though it would be.  Recommend to anyone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it is not any different than the app in your phone, it is a little faster and easier to use.
B000JQUMPI|3.0|It was a book about four young ladies. I would read it if you liked somewhat sad books and somewhat romantic.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this is a great movie from sherwood school in albany ga. it is a great movie about believing in god and spending time with your kids
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I kinda liked this book because I like to look up some really cool and difficult words. Now I'm done
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great. Could  not put it down. I have read several of his books and never let me down. Always great.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|goes on. The story is different and has a little of every thing in it. She does a great job of making each book complete yet<br />making you a little surprised but only too happy to find there bis yet another book.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It was an awesome movie as the others but I didn't think as good as the first. The first one was my favorite, but it is good enough for a second watch.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Tracks time, moves, scores. Ads are annoying at end of game, but you can close them quickly. Sometimes moves cards on its own if you just.tap
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's good but it can get kind of weird at some parts. But other than that it was such a good book!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Hello,<br />I heart this game, a lot. I m mad that we can only design four people. People are paying to have your app...why not give them what they want?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this novel. One minute it's hot and steamy the next it all in your space with truth. With a man that never really gives up on what he wants or thinks he want either way it's dicey.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|People have been saying things... and... they should really make a thing that is special not to say a word.
0345803493|1.0|I really didn't see the appeal in these books. I thought It wasn't written well.  The characters are annoying too.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This movie was absolutely incredible! And the music on this \\"Highlights\\" album is breathtaking, I've had it on repeat since I bought it.<br /><br />Also, please note- it says \\"Highlights\\" from the Motion Picture Soundtrack because it's NOT the full length soundtrack. (I don't understand why people are getting so upset about that- it's pretty clear that it's only a Highlights soundtrack. They are not advertising it falsely.) Don't get me wrong- I also hope they will have the full length soundtrack out soon, but for right now I'm very thankful for this. And you will be too!<br /><br />Also- you can get this for $5 here on Amazon- compared to $15.99 on iTunes! Thank you Amazon!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is for your preteens who don't have a Facebook or Twitter or that other junk its almost as fun as Facebook games
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very simple,yet challenging. This is a game that I can enjoy as an adult as well as my six year old son.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing, left me on the end of  my seat, good ending, many twists and turns, couldn't put it down the whole time
B0086700CM|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is challenging which makes it fun. I like that you have to move by moving your Kindle but I am easily entertained.
B00742BVW8|5.0|&#34;Red Cliff&#34; is a close second.<br /><br />I love the story and the use of color.  There's nothing like it.  i recommend it without reservation.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews for this bag - it is an excellent, well-made bag for the price. I definitely don't want to advertise that I am carrying expensive camera equipment so not having a famous logo on it is a plus. I have 3 shoulder strap-type Tamrac camera bags ranging in size from small to large and after a while, the weight would start killing my shoulder. That's when I start doing the \\"shoulder shuffle\\" - moving the bag from one shoulder to another to alleviate the pain for a few minutes. I decided to get the Amazon backpack after walking around NYC for hours taking pictures during this Christmas season - which was painful as I am not a kid anymore and the weight was just too much to endure.<br /><br />As for the backpack, it is as advertised: it's not too big, appears to be durable, with well padded straps and back, it has plenty of space for my lenses, flash, cameras, and accessories, and the mini tripod carrying capability is a bonus - although that will defnitely advertise what you are carrying inside the bag. My 10\\" Tranformer tablet with the docking station easily fits in the front pocket - and I still have space for a few more items.<br /><br />I carefully looked at the stitching and seams to ensure this thing would not fall apart on me - which would be a disaster, and I'm happy to say the bag is extremely well made. For $29, this bag is an absolute bargain.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|The book is full of violent and nauseating images and certainly not for easy reading.  I am sorry I bought it and cannot see the movie, however well done.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a great book I recommend you buy it. It is a great book that anyone can read. Every page I just kept wanting to read more and more. It's a great book and you should read the whole series
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book had light-heartedness and was not some dark Scandinavian genre.  It also did not have a lot of unpronouncible names to remember. It is a good read for escape.
0307744434|5.0|The most artful, unusual, entertaining and well-crafted novel I've read this year.  Better late (for me) than to have missed it.  Could not put it down.  The author has conjured up a beautiful bit of magic!
B003NTSBUG|4.0|Not a fantastic narrative, but the visuals and matching music were worth it.  Kinda contrived at the end there, but see for yourself.
030758836X|1.0|This novel was utterly a waste of time.  Characters were shallow, superficial and unlikeable.  Plot was not interesting enough to finish the book.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Rather, if someone wants this kind of entertainment, watching it on cable tv programming would be more of a stimulant.<br /><br />Very disappointed, and feel it was also a waste of money.
0446554995|3.0|I'm sad to say that this new 'Pendergast' novel is just not up to the usual high standards of Preston and Child. For some inexplicable reason the book is broken into three stories: the main story involving the main protagonist, Agent Pendergast and also two additional stories involving other characters which have been included in other Pendergast stories.  The two side stories lend nothing to the main story and make no sense being included.  The main story is fine although the authors seem to be searching for more and more bizarre cases to involve Pendergast. The main story starts out nicely with some gruesome murders - but then it suddenly changes course and moves into a different story - most inexplicable. Hopefully, Preston and Child return to the basics of what made Agent Pendergast such a terrific character.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|Fun entertainment for the whole family. A pity that it was not shown on big screen in the cinemas here.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This was an epic film! This incredible film is broadly scaled cinematically, extremely visceral in passion and extremely personal for the audience.  Director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech, John Adams) did a forceful job of making a true musical of passion and feelings truly come alive with real compassion on screen.<br /><br />Having seen the stage version of the original production of Les Miserables many times, I went in a little skeptical that this kind of production couldn't be translated from the stage to the big screen and not lose its essence. Boy was I proven wrong. Hooper did an outstanding job with everything he had to work with. Based on the original book by Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Alain Boublil, (from the original novel by Victor Hugo of `Hunchback of Notre Dame' fame) with the masterful score by Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg, the movie is packed with extremely compassionate moments of the heart and soul of every one of these characters.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Reel Steel) gives the most colorful and compassionate performance of his career as Jean Valjean . Hugh is amazing to watch as he stars as the man who stole bread for his sister's son in order save his life. He intensely shows his 19 year imprisonment angst and his redemption of character with a true spirit of love and healing. I was impressed with how much of a range Hugh can really play.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway (Alice In Wonderland, Get Smart) gave a literally wrenching and tear evoking performance of the most recorded song in this plays history, \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\". She is passionate, visceral and real and you can only imagine what her character Fantine is going through. There wasn't a dry eye in the theatre when she sung her last note.<br /><br />Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Beautiful Mind) surprised me as the military leader Javert because I first, could not believe he could actually sing and then second, he played the passion and confusion of the man chasing the bread-stealer over decades as a real person with a misguided mission only to end up realizing he did the wrong thing all these years.<br /><br />Other stunning performances vocally came from Samantha Barks (Grover High) as the confused and heartbroken Eponine as well as Eddie Redmayne (My Week With Marilyn, The Other Boleyn Girl) as Marius who are both star-crossed - almost - lovers. Samantha swoons for Eddie and he swoons for Cosette played by Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, Red Riding Hood). Samatha has an amazing stunning voice as does Eddie's commanding vocal passion while Amanda sweet subtle and compassionate notes (as she always does) weaned the desire for love throughout.<br /><br />Young Cosette was played by first time performer Isabelle Allen with such realism that she personifies the poster that has always immortalized the play for decades!<br /><br />Special note for Sacha Baron Cohen (Hugo, Borat) and Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter, Alice In Wonderland)  playing husband and wife Th&eacute;nardier and Madame Th&eacute;nardier with the frolicking musical number \\"Master Of The House\\". They couldn't have been cast better and their chemistry together is pure comical magic together.<br /><br />Director of Photography Danny Cohen (The King's Speech, Pirate Radio) did a masterful job at capture broad panoramic images and a dark mood of the troubled times of the French Revolution. Coupled with amazing matte photography and more than period extended sets, the visual were stunning as well.<br /><br />Overall the film is an amazing and extremely dynamic with all the real passion of the original stage production has, but done in a believable and visually artistic way for the big screen. I thought it couldn't be done - and it was done - and done well. It's operatic and may be considered somewhat slow for those expecting car crashes, kung-fu fights or gun battles, but its filled with a real story and characters that should move you if you understand the personal angst of what makes these characters real to the story.  Masterfully done on an epic scale, Les Miserables is an amazing cinematic production.to the story.  Masterfully done on an epic scale, Les Miserables is an amazing cinematic production.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app. fun for slow days at work. works great on my kindle fire, no complaints at all
055357342X|5.0|Just finished book 3 and I have already started book 4, I have to say so far the storytelling is better than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. George R.R. Martin doesn't bore me like J.R.R. Tolkien did, as a matter of fact I think I stopped reading \\"The Return of the King\\" for Tolkien had whole chapters describing flowers. Talk about a snooze feast and hopefully book 4 of Game of Thrones series is just as intriguing as the first 3 books were. Game of Thrones is definitely not for children, well at least children who are too young or immature. For it does contain very strong adult issues such as rape, incest, violence, and so forth. All I know is when I reading G.O.T. it is like I'm transported to a different world or a different dimension. If you are a person who doesn't like fantasy then I would recommend that you read something else for this won't be your cup of tea.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm so picky but this simple game of solitaire is one of my most used apps on my kindle fire HD. It's great animation and variety of personalized settings can please anyone who love a time old classic. Must have on your tablet!

B004478GN8|4.0|I bought this for an 8 year old. It was smaller than I expected. I was told my nephew loved it
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|One of two of my favorite shows, love the twists and characters.  It is wonderfully cast, acted is fantastic and written superb.  I have season one on DVD and have season two on my DVR. So much happens that you have to watch it several times so you don't miss a thing.  Buy it you won't be sorry!!![[ASIN:B009RX8MQ0 Revenge: The Complete Second Season]]
B008476HBM|5.0|Though the language used throughout this book, is the stilted,formal verbiage of an era long past; the charm and humor of the protagonists is readily recognized.  The first time I read this book, was a required reading for a literature class.  Being a more \\"mature\\" reader, has greatly increased enjoyment of this volume.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I usually try to wait until the price comes down on recently released novels, but the novels written by Vince Flynn are so suspensful and easy to read that they are worth ehe cost.  This didn't disappoint
B005I3PAUO|4.0|Fans of Baldacci will not be disappointed- especially if you enjoyed The Camel Club, The usual action and twists and turns are in abundance here
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Disturbing.  Relevant.  Thought provoking.  Well written.  Collins creatively weaves a love story and relationships into to this timeless moralistic social dilemma.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book holds your interest from beginning to end. A great love story. A very realistic picture of World War 11 as fought in England.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've had my kindle fire for over a year now and haven't had any problems loading. I'm surprised people are having this much trouble.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|. . . but whenever I try to purchase the Space Eagle (extra help), it keeps \\"spinning\\" and stays frozen, doesn't proceed beyond that;  have tried many times, but it never goes beyond this point, so I can never purchase the extra Space Eagle.  Other than that, it is pretty good game.  I just wish it would allow me to purchase the extra help.  I may remove then reinstall and see if this fixes the problem.
B006LQQ1GE|2.0|...the rest, not so much. Their signature song is fantastic...but the remaining album is meh or perhaps even semi-meh. Buy the one song online.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I can't add anything to the other reviews except to say I hope that the current or future generations see what true genius is about. Led Zeppelin will be remembered with the same reverence as Mozart and Beethoven are today. Just an incredible experience.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Nicely balanced and not overwrought with screaming big band sound. Well executed and good song choices...kin of retro even, like the old Rat Pack.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The overall story was incredible. I very much enjoyed this book. I cannot wait to read the next two. However, I do feel the book lacked in a few areas, which is why I held back two stars. First, the written errors were bothersome, especially given this was my first book read on my new kindle fire. Given this book has been out for many years and this is an electronic copy I feel there should be no errors. As for the story itself, I feel inserting some snipers of how the family members, close friends and characters who had previous interactions with the Game's players were dealing with the Games, or at least those of district 12, would've be been key to an even better book. Additionally, given the normal response for two individuals going through a tremendous event, like the Games, is to fall in love, or rather mistake the intense chemical/physician responses they are flooded with for love, I feel Katniss should BE in love, especially since there was no developed love or any real hint of love between here and Gale. I am hoping the second book fills in these gaps. Lastly, length...it was too short of a book. Much more could have been told...Much more.
076790382X|5.0|Great book to read while making long trips, especially for overseas flights.  Always good to see our culture through another's eyes, especially with this level of humor.
0446580848|5.0|After all the bad news of 2012, I wasn't expecting to laugh when I started reading this book. I'd forgotten how funny Nelson DeMille can be, and I had at least five laugh-out-loud moments in the first few pages of Chapter Two. His observations are a hoot, and they help bring human nature back into play, even in the midst of real horrors. I have known funny men like Corey in my life, and I just want to say how much I've appreciated a little levity in dark situations.<br /><br />As for the rest of the book, which I am still reading (sorry!), I know more now than I ever wanted to about Yemen. Not gonna go there!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Better than the first. A must read for everyone. Can't wait for the next one thanks Amazon.  A a a
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I am thirteen and I thought this was a really great book and I love to read diaries about how other people see the same world that I see but I would not recommend this to friends my age maybe rather older adults but not thirteen year olds.

B007OV9EYG|5.0|You can never go wrong with Dr. Seuss. Love the stories that turn into movies.  Great cast. Great for the family.
B009LRE040|4.0|eh, it was an OK finish to the 3 movies. The deaths overshadowing this kind of downplay the movie aside from that the more human side of batman was a nice touch. Felt like a rehash however. The instant video quality was bad, so I bought the DVD still the movie for some reason I can't place my finger on is lackluster.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|Sometimes interesting but other times self-serving, seems to think he is gods gift to either sex and the most tortured rock star since Elvis.  A good, not great, autobiography.
0151003084|5.0|Oh how I love holding this small but unique book again. I was one of the few that read it in the YA section and hid it beneath all the other checked out books in hopes that it would be overlooked...Years later I love reading this to my mom's horrified ears...Edward Gorey is legend in my book...
B004NELBPC|5.0|ry good news site. Huffington Post has a very well rounded news site that covers every thing from up to the minute news to science.
B00846REIS|4.0|It's kind of like Fifty Shades but different. The characters and story line is different. It's good in its own way.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I bought the complete series of Dr. Quinn, [[ASIN:B002C6A6N6 Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series]] because I remembered when it was on TV, and caught a few episodes and truly enjoyed it.  It did not disappoint. Since I have bought my set, I have bought two other sets, for friends and family.  They would come over and start watching it with us, and pretty soon they were hooked as well.  It is something that the whole family can watch, a little bit of violence, but nothing like what is on  everyday TV today. Highly recommend, something that I will watch again at a later date.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I guarantee you'll end up reading the whole series.  Without fail a great series with complete characters and plots to keep you entranced.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|At my age and considering how slow Martin is, I may not see the end of this series because he's older then I am.<br /><br />I'm reading the whole series. This whole series is great, but Martin needs to write faster. There are so many characters and the plot is so complex its hard to keep track of everyone.<br />At the third book I had to go back and reread one and two because of the time that had gone by. At that time I thought there was only to be three books.
0545265355|5.0|My husband and son's read at least one chapter a night and got through the whole series.  Great books and they came quickly.

There are so many characters and the plot is so complex its hard to keep track of everyone.<br />At the third book I had to go back and reread one and two because of the time that had gone by. At that time I thought there was only to be three books.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book gives good insight to the dominant, submissive relationship. The author must have had a relationship like that, minus the love part (on Christians side) it's very close to the real thing.
B00514HDNW|4.0|The movie was much better. I have completed the comparison. So that can be marked off the list! Two words.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was prettty funny but vulgar and dirty at times......still it was entertaining. Exactly what you'd expect from Seth MacFarlane.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I'm reading the whole series. This whole series is great, but Martin needs to write faster.

B00A3XQVKW|4.0|It was good, but kinda hard to believe. I'm a Christian so I have a biased opnion, but still a good read if you take it all with a grain of salt.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is very fun. it is soooooo addicting very fun love how you have to earn your money once I got my kindle I looked to see if they had made this game they did not so I looked a month or two later and it wad there I was so so so so happy now I am addicted to this game it is so so so so fun like totally!!!
B008OIQYTG|5.0|I got everything I expected from this CD because Lee delivers everytime with something different but yet you know that this is Lee Ritenour that's playing.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|I loved this movie and completely fell in love with Thomas Horn as Oskar.  He moved me to tears multiple times during the film but when it ended I felt good rather than sad.  Going to keep an eye on this young actor.  Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, as always, lend perfect performances but this story is all about Oskar.  Highly recommend.
0439023521|5.0|My favorite out of the 3 Hunger Games books. Read this before you watch the movie! You won't be disappointed. Good for all ages
B0000669JL|5.0|It had all the wonderful Marley tunes that my late husband & I enjoyed; I sent it to my sister-in-law.

B00ADIT8U2|1.0|This is the worst game of its kind that I have ever had the displeasure of playing. Don't buy this.
B006O6F932|5.0|i had got this for my 6yr old daughter cuz she is a monster high fanatic she has 14 dolls and the car and some of the other things and this just topped it off she was wanting it so bad and for the price it was great i got it cheaper on her then in a retail store !!
B000YABS8E|5.0|This movie is a great family movie, funny and is appropriate for all ages I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good family time movie
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|This TV movie is just excellent.  As are all of these series.  Beautifully filmed.  The pace of the movie is so relaxing, it reminds one of the way movies used to be before all the .... well I don't know what the movies are about these days, other than explosions and noise and noise then more noise.  If the noise doesnt do it for you then the movies have become the bastion for four letter words.  Just a sad commentary on what is supposed to be entertainment  these days.
1878424777|5.0|This is one of the best audio C/D's in my large collection. Truly inspiration and informational. It's the absolute best.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|It was a really awesome movie and $3.99 was well worth the price. I tried to play it on my iPad but the color theme seemed a bit too dark. The plot is excellent. Could have more scenes for Alfred though. Hope to see the next episode soon.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|liked it.  sherlock is alittle stranger then the first one. but nice liked it never the less.<br />you have to pay attention or you won't know whats going on.
0545265355|5.0|Bought as Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She flipped out when she opened this...hasn't put them down yet. Nice box set and quality
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Lots of interesting plots.  Well written.  Deep on so many levels.  Enjoyed the journey of how two people worked out their issues.  Enjoyed the journey of recovery and finding love and happiness.  Can see how Part III is developing.  Very emotional...a book actually made me cry and laugh out loud!  I'm sure while reading this book my facial expressions were all over the place. Ana's inner voice is hilarious (writer gave me visuals I could relate to)!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book all way until up to the end.  I guess I was hoping for a different/complete ending but overall it was a clever storyline with a huge twist mid way through.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|I have spent plenty of time with this game and enjoy it thoroughly. Very cool. Will probably spend hours more...
B00992CF6W|4.0|OMG omg! The zombies get me every time. I get sooo scared when go like omph on me! Thats my only problem.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Like order I will order again if needed. It was a gift for my sister it's great purchase thank you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter wanted me to add this to my Kindle HD for her to play. I started playing it and was quickly addicted.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great way to spend an extra hour or two.fast paced and fun give it a try, you won' t be disappointed.
B001KQ031Y|4.0|This movie always makes me laugh. Nice to order and get it so quickly in the mail. Popped it in quickly and remembered why I liked it so much.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I am going to be strict and give only four stars, although emotionally, I'd like to give 4.5 (if fractions were allowed). Cloud Atlas finishes very well, better than I thought it would mid-way through. Here are six story streams diverted in mid-course, yet kept on course by a main stream of meta-narrative leading to an ultimately satisfying gulf. It is an original, albeit at times challenging, delta to navigate, but Mitchell is a master of maintaining motifs and tying up loose ends. What I found most difficult were incongruities in the prose of certain sections. While the Adam Ewing, Zedelghem, and even Timothy Cavendish sections connected well for me, the Luisa Rey section felt out of place. The prose here stood in a bothersome contrast to the rest of the book. I could not figure out who or what Mitchell was trying to emulate, or if he was trying to emulate anyone or anything at all. Both Luis Rey sections felt like a sudden, and odd divergence into a young adult novel, like a tributary that snakes off into woodland outside the delta before returning to the interlacing main streams. To his credit, Mitchell makes this section of the book more tolerable by filling it with action and continually increasing the pacing (esp. in the second half). The other section where I struggled with prose was the Zachry section set in a far future post-apocalyptic Hawaii. The dialect Mitchell invents, while not too difficult to navigate (it took me about three pages to click into it), feels contrived, if not a bit gimmicky. Normally, such an invented dialect would not bother me, but I felt like there were inconsistencies in it, as if Mitchell invented it on the fly, rather than basing it on plausible linguistic patterns. Perhaps it might have been better if he had mimicked or modified an existing form of pigin English? I don't know, but I found myself wearying of traversing all the bumps, jolts and odd flows of this particular narrative. By far, my favorite were the Sonmi 451 sections where Mitchell takes some now unoriginal sci-fi conceptions and deftly reinvigorates them. Moreover, his understanding of East Asian cultural mindsets is accurate and does not fall victim to common Western misconceptions. His dystopian 22nd century Korea is thus all the more believable. Criticisms aside, Cloud Atlas is a marvelous read and I would recommend it to anyone with an appreciation for speculative fiction. Readers who stubbornly insist on realism only in fiction may be frustrated with this novel, but that is their loss in general anyway.<br /><br />Iain Mavro Coggins is the author of [[ASIN:B008CBZE2I Lost Apple]]
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Playing on the kindle fire hd. I 've lost my entire game once already, and while I was compensated for the problem, it never should have happened.<br /><br />The &quot;friends&quot; portion is ridiculously glitchy. It doesn't work at all most of the time. Actual gameloft friends are impossible to visit.
034580404X|5.0|I purchased this item as a set and have just begun reading.  I'm not very far into the first book; however, I know it's going<br />to be 'good company' during these winter nights.  The price was great and I was able to use points earned from previous purchases.
030758836X|3.0|It starts out slow. Picks up alittle in the middle and ends ridiculously. Keep looking. You can find a better read out there. But<br />if you're like me you won't take the word of a stranger. It's not the worst book I ever read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy playing virtual city. it is very addictive but fun I would recommend it to a friend. play it its great.
0738727326|5.0|I'm new to tarot and had a old deck from a family member. I'm very pleased with this deck and the beautiful illustrations.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great book! Had me laughing & crying. The characters are so easy to fall in love with and care about their story
B0086700CM|3.0|Its really fun but subway surfers and jetpack joyride are a lot better. I don't see why people love it because its popular.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book has a good story line, a great cast of characters, and has a cliffhanger ending can't wait for book 4!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was excited to read this book and had no expectations other than enjoying a different read from a talented writer.  Even though the review is two stars I cannot say the writing in itself is terrible.  It's just the way the story is laid out.  It skipped around too much and took way too much time to get to the point.<br /><br />The story would have been better if it had fewer &#34;main characters&#34; and was shorter.  I got the point, as I'm sure other readers did, that the Casual Vacancy was something people wanted.  Perhaps there were meant to be more in-depth messages than that, but I didn't really get them if they were there.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this book is a well rounded ......... it has a good story line with a ending that was buried behind. I find that this is the best story out of the series so far. In other word  this book is imply flawless
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So good! Loved it!<br />One of the best books I've read in a long time! Love all 3 books.<br />Awesome
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it  so much it is awesome =)<br /><br />I'd read it a million thousand times I'd recommend it. It will make you laugh. The best  Diary of a wimpy kid book yet.<br /><br />  GOOD GOING JEFF KINNEY KEEP<br />  WRITING YOUR AWESOME DIARY<br />  OF A WIMPY KID BOOKS :)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey must write another book.  I laughed and still am about many of her stories.  She shares my sense of humor and I loved her on tv and even more in this book.  Thanks Tina for a great book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was so good I couldn't stop reading it! By far the best book I have ever read! Great book.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Funny amusing and interesting I liked the movie ally actually the talking bear is funny and Seth McFarlane is great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so good, I can't wait to read the other two books! In some parts it caught you off guard and you didn't know stuff was going to happen and the romance between Peeta and Katniss was incredible.
886613077X|3.0|I was hoping to find a good cheap planner for the coming year, and was excited about the small size at first. But when it came in the mail, I found that it was just about too small to write in. If you've got small writing and only put in the highlights of your plans, this could be the planner for you. But if you need to record any sort of details for your week with average-sized handwriting, you'll probably feel cramped for the whole year.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Superficial for history, not a history book, story set in backdrop of the great tragedy of WW I and the destruction of Western Europe
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book made me sad, angry, laugh, and cry all  a few 100 pages. This was my first book to read by Colleen Hoover, and I will definitely be reading them all!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have totally enjoyed book two and am looking forward to book 3. I am also looking forward to the movie!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very smart game that helps exersize reflexes and concentration. Super addictive and time consuming. Must Finish It.
B00406TRU4|5.0|Engaging, non traditional plot, close enough that you know the basic story. Wonderful actors, Colin Morgan is astonishing as Merlin, especially as the series goes on.<br /><br />Love the use of the castle at Pierrefond in France, and the use of the Andalusian horses.  The involvement of the horses grows over the series as well as the actors learn to ride; by season 2 they are doing most of their own riding.<br /><br />May be a little violent for sensitive children, but never any blood or guts. Even if someone is obviously run through by a sword, it emerges bloodless.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series!!
B0018CMJSU|4.0|Just a splendid return to old days and fond memories in comfort at your own place and in your favourite armchair.
6305388458|4.0|At the time this movie was made, no one was really to provide financing for the project. Thankfully, one of the &#34;Beatles&#34; put up the money.  It is great humor.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Definitely a worth while read. I read it in two days, I couldn't put it down! The beginning starts a little slow and it leaves you wondering about Katie, but by the end all questions are answered and the last chapter left me shocked!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|All of the other resident evil movies characters / monsters slammed into this movie.  Great Action!! The ending always leaves you waiting for the next movie release in the series.  If you didn't like the other resident evil movies then pass on this its the same plot /action which I loved.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Really good book definitely should read it funny, hilarious,and awesome best book of them all but a little short ok.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|I literally had to watch this movie three times before I was able to appreciate the creative beauty that is Cloud Atlas. I actually gave this movie a bad review before giving it a chance to speak to me. Perhaps the first two times I was tired. I did not allow myself to sit until the end of the movie both times. Although I knew from the many great reviews, there just had to be something worth while in the story and I really needed to give the movie an honest effort for the 3rd time. For the simple movie viewer, much like myself most of the time; and to those who enjoy films that are easy to understand, I recommend watching Cloud Atlas with an open mind, no distractions, and let the story evolve. If you allow yourself to focus on the story and characters, you will understand the depth and enjoy the story.<br /><br />\\"Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we are bound to others. By every crime and act of kindness we birth our future.\\"<br /><br />I now plan to read the book.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I liked the book very much, it was a good read . The book  Will keep you glued to the pages! And it's better to read at it at night so that you are able to enjoy the flights and scares I give the the book 5 stars!!!
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I have the full blown version of this on my laptop and I love the app to draw, doodle and sketch ideas.  This is much better than just a basic drawing program and it gives me a way to practice some skills in a portable manner!  I highly recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Downloaded this to Fire after my grandsons IPAD broke. He said it was a beeter then IPAD version. Not being a game player I would not know.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|Just got my Kindle Fire...so this is my first experience with this type of game.  Good one to start with as there aren't a lot of controls to figure out and I was up and racing immediately.  As I practice I get better at it.....and may try a different one but this is a great place to get started and see what it is all about!
1419705849|5.0|My grandson is in to the Wimpy Kid series and I bought this for him at Christmas. Found out that he got another one from someone else and he said he would keep one at my house and one at his house so I guess it is a good book for young folks.
B007KAJG3K|3.0|Got this for 3.99 on Black Friday. I think it's still only $7 at the moment, which isn't bad at all. The product description says there are no special features but there was a least 3 little \\"featurettes\\" so that was a pleasant suprise<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I thought the first movie ended on a mostly serious, and somewhat grim note with a lead up to what was supposed to be an epic showdown in the second film. But upon starting the 2nd movie the antagonist is no longer in the shadows so to speak, and the movie takes a turn for the comedic. It feels as though things are a little too light hearted at times, even though some very serious things are going on, and just comes off a bit disjointed for that reason. There are a few breathtaking action moments but a lot of the appeal and witty charm of the first movie seems to be lost here for some reason that I can't put my finger on. I would still recommend it, just be aware that it drags in the middle, but the showdown ultimately is worth it and has a very satisfying and smart conclusion<br /><br />Worth a watch, and at this price worth a buy as well. Doesn't live up to the first movie, but I do hope there is a third
0307352145|5.0|I bought this for my son who has aspergers. I thought he would like to read about others who kept to themselves while others around just talk and talk. I didn;t know if he would be in to it but he jumped right in a started reading so I hope it helps him.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy never disappoints . Love this book and the entire series of Jack Ryan. Hope there is a another one coming.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I wasn't sure about this show at first but now I'm hooked.  The actors work well together, the plots are believable and the sets interesting.  This is really the best program on tv at this time.  May it have many, many seasons to come.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I had to read a &#34;Great Book&#34; for my 8th grade class and this is what I chose. And yes, I am a boy! Nonetheless, it really was a great book!

B00AESN8XY|1.0|Do not buy this app you're wasting your money to unlock things its $16.00 total! These kind of scams need to become public and the customers need to be warned about spending on these kind of games!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I debated whether or not to give this book one or two stars & in the end, the truth is I really didn't like this book.<br /><br />It was just a mish-mash of every high school cliche & really tried OH SO HARD to be so thoughtful when really, it wasn't.<br /><br />After thinking about it for a few hours after reading it, I think my problem with the book is that it never could decide what it wanted to be- or rather, it wanted to be every stereotype of every problem high school kids have- like a giant afterschool special or the entire run of Degrassi all rolled into a couple hundred pages: suicide, unrequited love for the unattainable senior girl, gay high school quarterback, the step-siblings who just \\"get\\" each other, abortion, drugs, alcohol, socially awkward teenager who mysteriously gets accepted by the \\"fringe\\" of high school society, depression, bullying, abusive relationships, homophobia, you think of an issue, it gets tossed into the melting pot of this book... honestly I rolled my eyes so often I thought they were going to pop out of my head.<br /><br />The real issue with this book, however is that the voice of our narrator- Charlie doesn't feel like it has one ounce of truth to it.  He sounds as if he has a mental illness.  My first thought was that he would be autistic, or even bi-polar- which he may be, but none of that is discussed.  In the end they come up with another explanation which makes some sense regarding his behavior, but doesn't account for the voice with which he speaks throughout the book & which made me even more frustrated, since I was waiting for some sort of resolution with regards to why Charlie was the way he was & I felt that it was never fully explained.<br /><br />There are so many better books out there about the contemporary high school experience.  Pick one & skip this.  Or just rent Degrassi- it's far more satisfying.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|it was so fun until I stiled playing for a couple of days then I came back to it and it started closing me out.:(
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well done. Suspenseful. Well acted, written and executed.<br />I could not stop watching it and hope they will continue the series
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I like the quality and feel of this item.  Kindle fits perfectly in it.  Well made, zipper is sturdy.  I recommend this.
1439156816|5.0|I recently purchased Stephen King   On Writing - A Memoir of the Craft.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, the man is a professional, knows what-the hell he's doing and as such, it behooves me to pay close attention when he writes about writing--impressive, to say the least.<br /><br />First, producing a seminal book on writing is a stellar achievement, and not an easy feat, as Stephen King would remind us with the opening sentence of his Second Foreword:  \\". . . most books about writing are filled with bullshit.\\"  Yet, Stephen King has managed to shoulder his way onto an elite list with an incomparable reference for writers.<br /><br />Personally, I was tickled to find that many of my writing routines are similar to Mr. King's and I agree with most everything else.  (We all have our professional preferences.)  I was also elated to discover his pearls of wisdom.  You can bet I will put them to good use.<br /><br />The only shortcoming is attributable to timing.  On Writing was first published in 1999, long before the current Print On Demand/Self-Publishing evolution; and his advice on agents and publishers is outdated.  Otherwise this is a timeless classic that belongs in every writer and reader's library.<br /><br />Secondly, the method Mr. King uses to convey these pearls of wisdom is captivating, cloaking practical advice in a revealing glimpse into the man and his life.  It's a man of honesty and integrity that will speak the truth about his personal life--too tempting for most to air grievances and/or pound a bully pulpit.  Stephen King does not flinch, giving you both barrels of the bad and the ugly.  Well Done!  While from afar it may look like a bestselling author's existence is a dream come true, he lets us know his life hasn't exactly been a bowl of cherries.  (But then, whose is?)  Trust me Stephen, we all have our Bryan Smiths to confront.  And the more fortunate among us have our Tabitha Kings.<br /><br />I found myself not only agreeing with his astute observations on writing, but flat out liking the guy.  This is a fascinating read for anyone--writer or not.  As a result, I'm eager to read more of his fiction.  Here's to Mr. King's continued success.<br /><br />I highly recommend Stephen King   On Writing - A Memoir of the Craft.tute observations on writing, but flat out liking the guy.

B0030B1WBM|4.0|Jim Carrey's version of the Grinch is the best!  Watched it with the kids and there were plenty of laughs and giggles. The film was well done and even though this is the 7th time we've watched this movie, it's still awesome and entertaining.

B000I9W08I|5.0|Yes, it's a musical. Yes, it's got a few years on it, but it's still a classic musical.  Fit for viewers of any age.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This show is absolutely spectacular - it is very interesting and portrays the Roman empire as it might have been - the human drama and depravity - the interaction of greed, envy and lust mixed with the need to survive their own culture is well portrayed by the actors - it is easy to become swept away with the almost constant action of story!  I have thoroughly enjoyed Season One!
B008LSVL6U|5.0|This is easily the best sounding concert Blu-ray I've heard on my high-end system (yes...it really is high end, not Bose or some other mass marketed mediocre gear).<br /><br />The next best are as follows:<br /><br />  Toto: Falling in Between Live<br />  Jeff Beck: Performing This Week...

This book has eased my heartache and I feel I will move forward thinking of my son as being happy and joyous. He deserves it.  Thank you Dr. Alexander for sharing this book with us.

B009GEEMLY|3.0|Perhaps over hyped, The Avengers was a fun movie but not anywhere near the quality of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. It seemed to take a long time to get going with so much exposition required first. Always a difficult task to appeal to those who know the comic books (I don't) and those who don't, perhaps a Marvel fan would give the movie a much higher rating. The stand out actor/character in the movie was Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk.
B007KAJG3K|3.0|i was very excited to see this one in theaters but after listening to people bad reviews about the movie. It sort of discourage me, but i went anyways to see it. as i said in the title this movie is continuation of the first, but it fell short. i was disappointed; at times it was boring. there is less mystery  in the movie. this is okay, because they miss the big opportunity here just rent it on netflix or amazon prime or android play store.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A really great book for  kids and adults around great book a must have. In my opinion it is the best book in the series so far .
B001OQCV6K|5.0|12.99 thats the great price plus if you are amazon prime member amazon let you stream it while you are waiting for the order to arrive for free. The only thing is its only 48 hours rental. This is the must watch movie, dialogues, acting, location, actors and actress every piece in the movie is well done. This particular Sherlock adaption is different than earlier adaptations. The tv shows is more sophisticated than the movie. In movie you will fine more fight scenes but at the same time you will see Sherlock brilliant mind and his theories. Shows were more about his brilliancy. I loved the movie, i liked little bit of both this is why this is my favorite movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great. I use it all the time. If you don't have this app I reccomend it. You should try out the Pin It button where you bookmark it and you can pin anything.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very addictive.  I love that it moves a line of cards to a matching suite with one tap. When playing with 4 suites, almost all hands can be won using the undo option. I'm hoping to win one without it.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Batman is so cool, this movie just never gets old. I could watch it a million times and still not be sick of it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Enjoyed it very much.  Hard to put down.Keepsyou on edge.Have we come so far and still left the door open?

B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a nice easy read if you are looking to be mentally challenged, this is not the book for you.If you are looking for a cute easy read, I would recommend this book
B001VLXNLU|4.0|When I began reading this book I did not know if it was going to keep my attention. A couple chapters in I could not stop reading.  It was strangely addicting
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This is such an addicting show. We purchased the first 4 seasons and can't wait to move on to the 5th. Excellent storyline, great characters, and crazy events unfold in every episode.  You must watch this series!
030759565X|5.0|Great Cookbook!  Gave it as a gift but couldn't resist thumbing through it before wrapping.  I wanted to try every single recipe (even wrote a few down) so will have to purchase one for myself.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Bought this for gaming and was considering getting the i7 processor instead, but this thing performs so well there is honestly no point in getting an upgrade for it. Gaming-wise that is.<br /><br />For those of you looking to play Planetside 2 (the new crisis when it games running like ass) this processor combined with my GTX 660 runs the whole game on the highest settings at 60fps (Even during big battles, e.g. Bio Domes/Amp Stations)<br /><br />This thing is a Monster.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I love this dictionary!!! I think it is a great resource!!! I don't like the wording, its hard to read!!!
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|wAlthough there were 1 03 two songs we really liked, we were a little disappointed in this album as a whole.  So many of the songs sounded the same.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|I love the Beatles and that's why I spent the money for this box set. It's a fantastic reproduction of the studio albums and past masters, but if you already own all of the albums and aren't absolutely dying to get your hands on the book, I wouldn't worry about it. Like I said, I'm a huge Beatles fan and that's why I bought this.<br /><br />I read other reviews where people were having quality troubles with the way their stuff was shipped or something about the box or vinyls being damaged, This was not the case with me. My Vinyls arrived very quickly and in fantastic condition.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love all diary of a wimpy kid and rate all of them five star but I would rate them more if allowed diary of a wimpy kid is hilarious!!!!!:)

B0079R8IYW|4.0|handy for travel and for holding the Kindke while I read or watch a movies.  I am learning how to use my new Kindle Fire 7 &#34;
B007SGLZP8|4.0|What can anyone say about Grisham other than awesome!  I have all his previous books in hard cover, this one on my Kindle.  &#34;The Racketeer&#34; is gripping, although not quite as much so as some of his earlier works.  However, I'm sure the subject matter has a direct bearing on one's opinion of this.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys legal thrillers.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Both books brought a freshness  to my memories of that time. Well done. I look forward to the next one.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed the book, however there were many spelling and grammatical mistakes. I am a professional student and I believe if someone is going to write such an important book, that they should have checked this book before releasing it. To me, mistakes like this knock a few pegs down from a great review about an important mission for Americans.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|I absolutely love this album, came early and was reasonable priced! No scratches at all CD plays right on to perfection!!! Very satisfied!

B007FJFDXS|1.0|I played this game almost twice on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\". During the 2nd play my Kindle crashed to a black screen and was unresponsive. I remembered having read something about pressing the Kindle power button for 20 seconds if it becomes unresponsive. After doing this a half dozen times the Kindle finally restarted. The battery status was 61% at the time. I've had the KFHD8.9 for 3-1/2 weeks and I've used it for several hours each day with nearly 60 different apps I've downloaded. This is the first time it has crashed while any app was running. I assume the crash is related to Edge Extended, so I deleted the app. It wasn't very playable and has a clunky looking screen.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this is better than one, and that was not easy to do! I cannot wait to see what season 3 holds! Love the historical aspects in this show, and the gore is top notch! Not for the squeemish! Would have given 100 stars for sure!
B00ARAO720|2.0|Despite strained efforts at building excitement this was a boring film from start to finish.  The plot is poorly conceived, and the character's are one-dimensional stereotypes.  As for the plot i ask: Why is the bike messenger required when the woman requesting the delivery ended up at the destination at the same time as the bike messenger?  She obviously had plenty of time to take the thing herself.  I understand suspending disbelief in drama, but this really tests the viewer's intelligence.  That said, if you have 90 minutes to kill on a poorly conceived vehicle for 20 mph action where the biggest looming threat is an opened car door, then by all means spend your $3.99 on Premium Rush.
1469984202|5.0|The unexpected part was the price, the treasure part was how long this book hung around my thoughts. It begins so simply that you don't really think you will keep reading, maybe it's a little elementary... But the next time you come up for air, notice it's now dark outside, oh gee what time is it, really? And just like that, you're fully hooked. The five books collected in the Omnibus went by much too quickly, and I'm now starting on First Shift-Legacy. Some reviews say it's better? We'll see..
B00005S6K8|1.0|This movie  only plays on USA DVD machins I live in England and could not play it, it was out of my reagen Sabrina
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I felt as if I were apart of the love story, I could feel the pain they felt as easily as the love they had for one another.
B0063IH60K|5.0|nice way to  pass away time when you're bored. you can get addicted to it. would. recommend it. I use it every night
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I'm not the best at chess, so the computer, if higher than halfway on the difficulty spectrum, usually beats me. So that's frustrating, but expected.<br /><br />I haven't tried playing human v human, but I expect it to be equal amounts of fun.
B004OZZ624|2.0|A few flashes of entertainment, mostly dull, good acting. It seemed good from the reviews but the story developed way too slowly. Lots of inconsistencies.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The movie came and was the perfect gift for my kids for Christmas.<br /><br />I purchased this on sale and it was well worth the money. My kids probably have this movie memorized by now
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Simple story told on screen with style and grace. Great use of space and camera movement. Beautiful film visually. If you like coming of age films this is one of the best I have ever seen.
B006RXQ800|2.0|The movie is awesome!! I give the movie 5 stars.<br />I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, and he was a little disappointed. I guess I didn't see where it said that the movie is on 2 disc. You watch the first couple hours and then get up and go put in the second disc to watch the ending of the movie. Thought that technology had gotten us past that, but not for this movie.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Hugo certainly knows have to invent, create and introduce characters. This book belongs in everyone's Kindle. It's length is like a great part time job one loves. As I read this classic I can see it as a template by what can happen in America's future. It is must reading and do it slowly. It is that enjoyable.
B004EPZ034|5.0|My daughter was very happy to have this movie show up Christmas morning. This Mom was very happy with the price!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game and would recommend it to others. you will have lots of fun. Kids will love it also/.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We enjoyed our Harry Potter marathon! This was an awesome deal. We will enjoy these movies for many more years!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Grabs you right from page one.  I laughed and cried.  A quick read because you won't be able to put it down.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Finally found the whole set to replace my vhs tapes that are starting to show their age. Great price!<br />Only complaint, can't use the repeat option to replay the movies.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|I down loaded this from Amazon Prime, it kept cutting out.  The movie sucked so bad that I didn't care too much.
B000077VR3|5.0|Moulin Rouge was not what I expected, in the good way. It had been recommended to me for years, but I only recently watched it - I can't believe I waited so long. The music is entertaining, adding drama or excitement to every scene. Ewan Mcgregor will make your heart break (and has a surprising set of lungs.) The bohemians are hilarious and provide great comic relief.<br />They give away the ending at the beginning, but the style of the movie allows you to forget that, (hoping for the best) and still get the surprise of the ending.<br />I love this movie. You should watch it.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|Better than the first release! Colin Farrell pulled it off, much better than Arnie.  Gary J. Glenn  Huntington Beach, CA
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game love it!!  Wished I more time to enjoy it.  My Godchild found it for me and loaded delighted with it!!
B008KNZ4LO|5.0|the best action movie in years!!!!<br /> I just sat thru the mega budget Expendables 2 and I thought I was watching an Asylum movie..<br />Nothing compares to this just amazing
B006ZZANG0|5.0|I really enjoy the music and voice of Rufus on this album only. I really enjoy the lyrics he wrote.
0451228731|5.0|This book covers all kinds of infrastructure weaknesses and the weakening of society. Shadowy conspiracies and constant twists. I got sucked into this book hard and finished it in a day. Was very sad to find that it didn't really have a clean ending. This book and it's sequel Kill Decision really feel like they should be one book, that would make for one long read though. Strongly recommend this series to anyone that is a bit more tech oriented and can appreciate the realistic technology, social engineering, and clever plots that Daniel Suarez details.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|My whole family love Pinocchio. A Classic movie that every child should see always. It is really lovely and make me remember my old days :)
B008MM9630|5.0|My daughter loves this game.  Easy to use.  Great graphics. Works great on my Kindle Fire HD.  I was not able to connect it with my Face book account.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Had wonderful packaging, lots of extras came with it. Shipped on time, and got here safely. Couldn't of asked for better service
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great tool and very easy to use.  Has made my life much easier now that I have some of the apps.  Would recommend this product to others
B000F8O35U|2.0|I am feeling a bit ripped off.  Went to enter the Disney code only to find out this was used and the code not valid.<br />Too late to return, so beware
B000VWE5OY|5.0|BBC has such great shows! I'm not sure which one I love more (right now it's a toss-up between Torchwood, Being Human and Primeval),. Great adult sci-fi drama with humor and occasionally hot scenes; but not for the narrowminded. John Barrowman has reprised his role from Dr. Who as Captain Jack Harkness and is the head of a covert team who hunt aliens and scavenge their equipment. Each team member adds his or her special talent to protect the public and foil the aliens (and sometimes misguided or evil people). Capt. Jack is my favorite character; an outspoken rogue from the future who cannot die, and is bisexual. He has more charisma and charm than anyone should have. Eve Mendes, who plays Gwen Cooper is my second favorite. Described as the heart of the team, she's an ex-policewoman with a quick comeback and the strength to stand up to Jack:I love their scenes together. The CGI effects, acting, storylines and beautiful Welsh countryside add up to great entertainment!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really like this game and it is really fun to play with! Don`t get me wrong but I an about to be 11 years old.and I think that this game is really fun.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love how I can set the alarm to gradually get louder instead of startling me awake. I can set the alarm for different times on different days and not have to change it constantly like a regular clock. I can also set more than one per day for when my husband and I wake up at different times.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is suspenseful, romantic, and sad all in one. For me it really picked up halfway through and I couldn't put it down. I cried like a baby in the ending. A must read.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|I chose this rating because the movie, even with all it's action sequences, had no plot whatsoever.<br />And while, in the trailers, you get excited because you're curious as to why they brought back Jill Valentine as well as other characters, you find that after watching the movie, there was no purpose for their return at all.<br />The acting was mediocre, unfortunately.<br />It just seemed like it was a movie that was made just because they could; with no possible quality story line or plot as well as reasoning. AND, as I had predicted, it trails off at the end to reveal that there could possibly be another movie. But why? There's absolutely no reason for it.<br />I was so disappointed in this rent.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finally they got a happy ending.after having to fight to survive .having the ones they love die.having to kill to stay alive.together they are strong.and now they have a son and daughter to cherish.I loved these books.....
B00A31UXLW|5.0|This book is up to the usual standard that sees Bosch pitting his wits against the baddies and his senior colleagues.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was such a perfect book. Made me cry. I absolutely loved it.  I would recommend this to anyone! Spectacular.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I'm not sure what I missed, but I do not see why so many people thought this movie was funny.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that pocket edition could use a few more blocks and a less complicating nether portal because I get a little ticked off that I can't ever remember how to put it together.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very well written! As others suggested it is similar to FSOG but there are many differences as well! Sylvia Day helped me thru my FSOG withdrawals and I CANNOT wait to read more by her!!! Excellent book!!!!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I loved the book but I was truly sad /mAd that Tim and Therese never ended up together so yeah.
B00129H7VS|5.0|My son loved the Series when he saw it on TV. I saw a great deal on it and bought it for him. He was delighted to receive<br />it and said it is his favorite Christmas gift.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Bests kids app ever a little annoying but F-U-N fun you need to buy this app I love it tom ( the cat ) is so funny he says what you say you can step on his toe punch him pull his tail and much much more he makes me LOL best:)
B0029XFNA8|5.0|This is an all time favorite that we watched on TV for years. We are very happy to have it in our collection.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett shows again what an awesome story teller he is.  However, there were too many &#34;small world&#34; coincidences for 5 stars.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|My husband loves old war movies and this was one he did not have. He was very happy to receive this one for Christmas.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I downloaded this as FAOTD and because of the great reviews.  Well I'm obviously the lone idiot here because I tried and tried to figure out the game.  It started with no tutorial or even an explanation of what do do.  All I could do was fling blobs of glie around and nothing happened.  .Very boring.  Glad everyone else is able to enjoy it though.
0793563836|5.0|This is a pretty basic book and will get teh beginner into the basic very quickly. I would recommend this as a good starter book
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It seems initially a bit of an oxymoron to say that I loved this book. Yes, the writing was clear, informative and held my interest very well. Yes, it clearly described the events chronologically while also providing necessary historical background. But what is so scary is that this book seems as though it was dreamed up in Hollywood as some dramatic action-adventure. Unfortunately, this story is true and fact is, indeed, stranger than fiction. It is hard to beleive that in this day and age, places like this still not only exist but that their government thumbs their nose at the outside world and due to ignorance, politics and whatever else, atrocities like this are still present today. Have we not learned anything as a global society?<br />The book is very thought-provoking and is a real eye-opener. Although I pay attention to main-stream media, this book takes you completely beyond those evening highlights; I will never view news from here (or other places) the same and it has forever sunk itself into my memory. How would I have fared in such as situation? Not so well, I would have to admit.<br />Highly recommended.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Like &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; it is entertaining and educating, an easy way to gain an historical perspective of the early 1900&#34;s.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What can I saw about this movie?  I have seen the broadway musical twice.  I have watched the Les Mis concert presentations (10th and 25th anniversaries) which include amazing singing but leaves out the acting.  I have watched about three different non-musical dramatic movie presentations.<br /><br />For hard-core broadway buffs, this movie will not satisfy.  The singing is not perfect, there is a raw element to the  singing and the tempo changes within songs based on the actor's portrayal.  As a straight musical, the lack of perfection can be a distraction from songs that theatre buffs know by heart and expect to hear sung brilliantly.<br /><br />But looking beyond perfection, this movie adaptation of the musical brings to life elements that cannot be placed in the live theatre.  A lot of close-ups, showing dirty, scarrred, and uglified faces of the people that must have been in the streets of 19th century France.  There is a raw grittiness to the scenes... nothing is pretty, even Anne Hathaway comes across as emaciated and steadily declines in appearance as her hair is roughly chopped off and she has  teeth pulled for a few francs.  Hugh Jackman's appearance is startling.  The theatre cannot do justice to the rough appearance of  early Valjean that Jackman portrays.<br /><br />The singing is a huge part of this movie, and it ranges from spectacular to passable.  I have read critics who panned Crowe's singing, and although he is certainly not a match for some of theatre's great presentations of Javert, Crowe sings at least decently.  What he lacks in singing he makes up for in his presentation and acting, and all in all I thought he made a fine Javert.<br /><br />I saw this on Christmas day this year and now am waiting impatiently for the DVD.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I like Jason Mraz's new music.  Nice easy listening music with so much passion for such a young artist today.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Going into this book, I was skeptical of how much I would like it or if I would even be able to finish it. But honestly, Charlie is so relatable, remarkable and just straightforward. He doesn't try to hide his imperfections or mistakes,but rather shines a light on what he thought of the situations. To me, this baring of his soul to the reader, that was what made this book epic. When reading it, taking in all the words and emotions of Charlie, you can't help but to feel...in infinite.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Good effort from Rod Stewart on this holiday recording.  Enjoyed listening to this over the Christmas season this year and look forward to many years of holiday listening in the future.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|What a great coming-of-age book. The way the story is told is so originally perfect.  What a captivating, original read!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Great music from Van Morrison as expected.  He continues to create wonderful sounds and am enjoying this new set of recordings.
034580404X|5.0|This set of books was great and in geat condition.I got them in soft covered books and will enjoy letting my friends read them and like them as well as i did
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The way the story blends with the original Bourne stories is incredible and believable.  Full of action, suspense and intrigue!
B004AQR29C|3.0|lots of shock and awe.  Little storyline.  previews and trailers made it look a little better than it actually was
B003INBOAG|5.0|I love it
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I bought this book from a recommendation from a friend who read it, I was unable to put it down and finished it in 2 days!!!
1419704400|5.0|When I first saw this book I was a little scared because it didn't have a look inside feautre (as other books do) but I went ahead with my instinct and bought it. The book is really large and heavy about 40-45 cm in length, and is a hardcover book.<br /><br />Expectations I bought this book for my photgrapher girlfriend when she saw it her jaw dropped and every thing page she saw she said \\"awesome\\" thats how good it is. The book is filled with high quality, huge fashion photographs, it includes modern and classic pictures even famous ones, as a whole it is a very beautiful book totally recommended as a gift for a photographer, or anyone who appreciates this form of art. Besides this is one book you could keep in your living room and draw a lot of attention!! Five stars for me!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It's more then someone can bargain with. This book will take you through many feelings that life throws at you. You'll fall in love with the two character's.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Product is in great condition. CD case is new and there are no scratches on the CD. Been playing it since it arrived.Perfect shopping experience.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I watch this movie every Christmas!!! Love it!!!!  Got parts from this movie memorized- can quote it as it plays.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|I love the series but I also love extras.<br /><br />There was no director commentary and access to the extras is pretty confusing. Another thing is that just because it's on Blu-Ray does NOT mean they are of higher film quality. They are just stored on Blu-Ray discs and not of high definition.
B005S9EK1S|3.0|This has a slower story line.  Overall it was pretty good I wouldn't watch with children it is a little explicit.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|Take Shelter is a gripping tale of an average man caught up in his own mental illness.  His reaction to his dreams and  premonitions have huge impacts in his relationships both personally and professionally.  Nicely paced and well acted.  A pleasant surprise of a movie.
B003JBHQP4|4.0|I use this product many times and it saves time putting differt meroy cards in the slot it may go in. Works as well as it says it does and would buy anoyher if I had too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a good book. What a Great and easy read. I Loved it! Now On to the next one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly has once again written a great Harry Bosch novel. The story holds you until the end and you can feel what Harry is thinking and his emotions. Great book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Started out enticing but fell flat and got a bit boring near the end.  didn't like the end.  I love mysteries and thrillers, but I have read better ones that kept up the suspense longer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. Very suspenseful and frightening! It's interesting how so many marriages run into these type if marital issues without the whole frame and kidnap aspect, just the root of all issues. I however absolutely hated the ending. Neither if them got the justice they deserved, the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars. I will be looking into other books by Gillian as this is the first I've read if hers.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Kept me playing almost all day. Wasn't thrilled that the free version ended mid scene wanting me to purchase to continue, but I did and it was good. Really enjoyed playing.
1601251505|3.0|My cred, briefly:  I've published a feature article in Dragon Mag.  I've DM'ed off and on for 30 years.<br /><br />Why I'm writing:  I've sat on the sidelines during these past few years of D&D chaos, but I wanted to write here, as the best way for my 2 cents to be noticed by 5th edition designers, and their PF competitors, in hopes of helping them to take a better tack with the next gen of our favorite RPG.<br /><br />My take:  Back in A.D. 2000, D&D v. 3.0 really breathed life into a game which had been thoroughly trounced by Magic: The Gathering during the 1990s.  People who hadn't played in a decade began playing again.  We saw the irony in the fact that Wizards (the publishers of Magic) had purchased and reanimated the corpse that they had helped create, and we clearly saw the rapid publication of 3.5 in 2003, only 3 years after 3.0 came out, as a naked money grab.  But the game was really well reimagined and redesigned, and so we kept playing, and really enjoyed it.  Right through 2008, when they announced and then brought out 4th edition, which to most of us veterans was a true travesty.  `Healing surge' pretty much says it all.<br /><br />So I switched to Pathfinder, or at least I tried to.  It's good; better than 3.5, but, in the immortal words of Bono, \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for.\\"  Why?  The problem is that the 3.5 redesign's flaws have become increasingly apparent as the system ages, and as it has been torn apart by 4.0 vs. Pathfinder wars.  What problems are these, you might ask?  Please allow me a brief list...<br /><br />1)  Pathfinder, like D&D 3.5, suffers from 'overdesign.'<br /><br />The designers working on these versions are professional 'game designers:'  masters of system for system's sake.  Gary Gygax & co were, first and foremost, history and literature buffs.  Do you see the difference?  I open the PF Core Rulebook to p. 327, and find the spell 'Rage.'  The description runs: \\"Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC.  The effect is otherwise identical to, etc. etc.\\"  My point is that spells, feats, abilities, etc., are all designed in this game to give bonuses to one another, first and foremost.  Fantasy 'reality' is not even necessary, but almost gets in the way of the designer's 'system.'  In 1st edition, the effects (fireball, lightning bolt, sleep) came first, the storytelling came first, and rules came second.  Now, generations of designers raised on generations of video games and other game `systems,' have gotten so entangled in this self-referential metasystem, that the fantasy 'reality' of what it is supposed to represent has been neglected.  The new games should be playable in your mind first, and tabletop second - this is a test for whether the game is story-based or rules-based.  3.x and PF are at heart too 'tactical tabletop.'  If I want that I can play Warhammer.<br /><br />2)  PF does not feel enough like it is based in medieval history or literature, but rather in 'game system-land.'<br /><br />My point:  future edition designers absolutely must start with medieval history, not with a 'system.'  And they need to start with historical literature that comes from and compliments that history.  Not just the derivative stuff, but the real historical literature that Tolkien was familiar with.  Medieval Arthuriana, Beowulf, the real thing.  They need to know medieval economics, and art history, and how to tell a story.  So much has been discovered in these fields in the last 30 years - the designers should embrace this richness and weave their stories from it.<br />Story Driven also means that 'game balance' should not be some sacred mantra.  Who cares if the Cleric spell 'Command' is overpowered for 1st level?  That's why it was so awesome!  Poison should kill you, not just do 1d3 Con damage!  Ditto Level Drains.  And 'Eyes of Charming,' can't be randomly worth 52,000 gp, when a good horse is 30gp.  Those eyes are not worth 1,700 horses, guys.  There has to be realism in the economics, too.<br /><br />What else did we love in 1st Ed, that is still missing here?  Another aspect is Tiamat, Orcus, Demogorgon, Odin.  We loved the real, historical mythologies:  demons, devils, angels, dragons, gods, and demigods.  That was by far the most awesome part of the game.  Give us history, give us real mythology.  Who is not embarrassed at the idea of worshipping 'Wee Jas'?  As Eric the Cavalier (from the old CBS D&D cartoon) would say, \\"Gimme a break!\\"  What is a 'Wee Jas?'  Or, in PF, a 'Shelyn?'  Get real... literally, and people will get much more excited again.<br /><br />3)  Storytelling, in modules, has to be key.<br /><br />And a third element that's missing from 3.5 and PF:  compelling modules.  Notice that not a single memorable module has come out of the whole 3.0-era movement, which is now 12 years old?  There is no Tomb of Horrors, there is no Ravenloft, no Pharoah, no Against the Giants.  Why is that?  I fear that even RA Salvatore, who has been enlisted by Hasbro to 'save' 5th ed., is too immersed in this self-referential 'fantasy island,' to write a truly good module.  How do you do that?<br /><br />Part of the problem is that the 3.x and PF modules have been designed using 'Systemese' calculations such as \\"Challenge Rating.\\"  First off, I find I can take a single basic character and beat the average Challenge rating for a party of 4, so the modules are designed pretty whimpily for a smart player.  But then, again, so many 3.x and PF modules I have tried also have so few interesting monsters... why is this?  Often, it will be 80% kobolds, or orcs, and perhaps 1 or 2 more interesting monsters.  Who wants to do that?  This is 'realism?'<br /><br />In the good old days, 'monster ecology' was key.  Whole articles in Dragon were devoted to it.  Now, it's Challenge Rating.  Again:  note the difference.  Before, it was story driven, now, encounters are 'built' using number crunching.  What's wrong with throwing in (even by accident) a monster that's a bit too hard for your players?  Isn't that half the fun, deciding when to play, and when to fold 'em, when to walk away, and when to run?<br /><br />4)  Idealism is the heart of fantasy, and it shows in the art.<br /><br />Why do we still like Luke and Han, Aragorn and Legolas, and yes, even Harry and Hermione, after all these years, when so many other heroes have been forgotten?  The true key, is that they embody idealism (and their villain antagonists, negative idealism).  Too few of the characters and NPC personalities churned out in the 3.x and PF era are imbued with this.<br /><br />For me, the ideas at the core of an RPG are immediately apparent from its art.<br /><br />Who were the best DnD painters of all time?  Elmore, and Easley.  Why?  Because Elmore in particular was a total heroic idealist.  His covers for Dragonlance embodied nobility, intelligence, and in short, the best aspects of heroism, which are also present in Luke, Aragorn, and Harry/Hermione.  His evils had the grandeur of Vader and Sauron.<br /><br />I open the 3.5 PhB and find \\"Kerwyn,\\" leering out at me:  a listless, unidealistic punk with excessive piercings and nothing in his noggin, and, worse, no raison d'etre.  I look at the art in PF and find a barbarian on p31 with a ridiculously oversized sword, which throws any sense of historical realism right out the window.  PF is not `final fantasy,' it is the heir to DnD.  What would Gygax say to this, who lovingly spent untold hours researching medieval polearm design and meticulously reproducing them in the original Unearthed Arcana?  The goblins and ogres in PF look like idiotic cartoons; no real sense of menace, or realism.  None of the PCs, likewise, have anything sympathetic in their brows or their gaze.  They all look self-absorbed, power-hungry, random, and ultimately, self-referential, like the game system-land that is their Alpha and their Omega.<br /><br />Thus:  people say the art in PF is 'great,' but I say, it is a slight improvement over 3.5, because it is slightly less banal.  But what would really be stirring, would be a surprising, compelling new heroism, something that made me think that fantasy was a place where the ideals I fall short of in the real world can be exercised and given life in cooperation with my friends.  If all I wanted to do was exercise my base desire for repetitive violence, I could just go fire up a first-person shooter on the x-box.  RPGs have always, at their best, been much more than this--they have embraced heroic idealism--and I hope that the games designers of today and tomorrow will stand up and take notice.<br /><br />-t.e 'built' using number crunching.

B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Still spooky, but it was on the verge of jumping the shark.  It had vastly different genres of scary going on in the same story line which seemed a bit disjointed and over stretched.<br /><br />Still appreciated the actors high quality performances and creepiness.

0525478817|3.0|I confess I'd never heard of John Green but the plot seemed intriguing so I bought the book.  I wanted to love it, like the 5-starred readers did.  But I didn't ever find myself relating to the characters.  I found myself wanting to know the backstory of the main characters' illnesses.  To understand more what experiencing their deathly diseases was like.  What was it like when they were diagnosed?  The reaction of the parents.  The reaction of the kids.  The reaction of their friends.<br /><br />I guess I was looking for more substance.  Like  what I'd find in a Jodi Piccault novel. Instead, all that I had expected was replaced by a peek at Augustus' sisters and kids, Hazel's girlfriend and Van Hauten.  They were so quickly introduced and then gone (except maybe for Van Hauten) I felt they brought no relevance to the story.  Van Hauten's first appearance made sense but once with him was enough.  His second appearance was totally implausible.<br /><br />I'm 61 and I know this a YA book.  Maybe that is my problem...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was one of the most fascinating books I have  ever read.<br /> It is a comforting book if you have recently lost someone and it's a reminder that we are all connected.

0395389496|1.0|this book is a wonderful classic Christmad book.  However, I was extremely disappointed when I opened this book and many of the pages were damaged.  I ordered several other books at the same time and their pages were also damaged.  I have ordered books from Amazon before and this is the first time they have not been perfect when delivered.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I have read all of the other books by the fantastically awesome John Green and I am happy that I saved this one for last, but I don't know why. It is beautifully written and did not disappoint.
B004BSFC46|5.0|I bought these for my 4 month old son for Christmas and he LOVES them! They keep him entertained for hours at a time and doesn't irritate his delicate skin! I love the fact that he can hear them rattle, but it's soft enough to where it doesn't annoy me or my husband! Very satisfied with my purchase!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|\\"Team of Rivals\\" provides an in-depth account of Abraham Lincoln's inner circle of friends and political adversaries and how he navigated a tumultuous period in American history with these men at his side.  It reveals a man of great depth, insight, and political acumen.  While not quite a biography of the \\"rail splitter\\" there are many stories and accounts of his personal life as well.  Even if you were well acquainted with Lincoln's life previously you will learn a great deal more.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|This book just feels like I am being played by the author.  Many of the chapters barely move the action along.  I was really invested in all the characters and wanted to know the outcome, but I lost patience about half way through.  It really feels like there is about two full books worth of ideas and action being stretched into six (or seven) books.  If you can read chapter after chapter without any real payoff or reward, then you have more patience that I do and you may enjoy this series.  I am done.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Perfect holiday flick. Don't know how I missed it originally, but glad that I finally found it. Big fan of this one!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A detailed history of the European aspect of WWII, told around fictional characters that flesh out the facts.  It is easier to read than the first novel in the series, which was based on WWI.  It clearly illustrates the problems with the various forms of dictatorships and the warped thinking of the leaders.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|If you are looking for great training details, and very little substantive information, this book is fine for you.  The prelims for the book were very high, but the delivery not so much.
B000HEUYQ4|5.0|I had previously read this book and had it on my best liked list.  I bought this one to give to my High I. Q. nephew.<br />He l liked it so lwell he started seeking out other books by John Lecarre.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Fun read for those that consider themselves a little nerdy especially those that remember the 80s. Starts off very strong but 80s references and IT jargon begin to feel a bit like a crutch. Still some very novel use of integrating classic sci-fi and video game story lines into the main thread of this story. Easily the best piece of \\"fan fiction\\" I've read, which while it technically isn't, is exactly how it reads.<br />I feel $10 is a little steep for this in ebook form, but should definitely be picked up if it ever goes on sale.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|We read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Lots of death. Lots of action. Lots of love. Good date book.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I like all their songs but I think this album is my favorite.  There isn't a bad song on the whole disc.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|These young singers are the best that I have ever heard.  I can't for the life of me, understand how they lost to a dog act, on BGT.  They are going to be great stars, and I for one will always love to hear them sing.
B00003CXIP|5.0|My 14 year old asked for this for Christmas, and has already watched it more than once!  It's a classic that has held up over time!
B009SJ3Q14|4.0|I missed this on tv, so I bought it off amazon live. It's a good early episode in this hit show. The only complaint I have is that the show doesn't have any customed villians. Well one that is on the island. But the green arrow is only as good as his villians and he needs more radical villians. And the press would have dubbed this guy the arrow or green arrow, not the vigilante. That's what they do. Minor faults in a great show though. This is a well acted show too. Top notch.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Watched season one on netflix, and missed the beginning of this season on tv. Now I can watch the entire season as it is released. Not suitable for weak stomachs-thought provoking and gory. Very interesting and entertaining.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|One last run for the MIB crew, was a pretty good movie with some typical amusing scenes between Smith and Jones.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|LWhat an incredible depiction of a man who believes it is more important to do what is right than what is popular!  I recommend this movie to anyone who finds themselves in a compromising position over truth.  DON\\"T EVER EVER GIVE UP!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have intel i5 2500k that I have not overclocked yet and probably won't. I bought that cpu because it was a good deal and I might need the quad cores for VM's. Anyway I have an ASUS P8Z77-V PRO LGA 1155, and EVGA 560 Ti FPB GPU and a Thermaltake Mk-1 chaser... lots of rooms and several 200mm fans. I tried the stock cooler using the pre-applied paste. I just stuck it on there on the cpu as I had no more paste and the small round surface area of the cooler was covered with paste. So, my experience with the stock cooler was 90c to 98c when running prime95 and I even got 70c when running the Windows Experience Index test. I installed world of warcraft just to see how my system performed. I put the settings in the game on Ultra and also tested Medium settings. The cpu would quickly rise to70c and stay in that range. After I installed the Hyper 212 plus with Artic Silver paster the drop in temps was dramatic. The Prime95 test now only reaches 50c (thats at 100% cpu load) the WEIndex test only briefly reached 45c. WOW, on Ultra settings, now runs at approx 35c-40c. I can't comment so precisely on the idle temps but I know they are lower too. I am pretty sure pre-install the cores were in the 35c range now they are 25c-30c. I only have the one fan installed on the CPU cooler and I can't hear it at but I do have the sound of the case fans which is only 15dba which is quite low. So I am very pleased and impressed.<br /><br />Installation was not very difficult though a little tricky. I did not remove the Mobo, my case has a cut out on the back side. Not bad, just watch a you tube video on the subject and you'll be fine. I give it 5 stars ++<br /><br />The only Con I have is on start up of the PC I get CPU fan error that delays start up and I have to press F1. I do have it plugged into the 4 pin cpu fan connector. So far I haven't seen a way to change this in the bios or found a solution online. If anyone can clue me in , thanks in advance
B0032FPVKE|3.0|It's protective and compact...but aside from holding an SLR body and short lens, there's little room for anything else. Not for the accessory geek.
098478280X|5.0|The book was really great in refreshing all those algorithms that we sometimes forget. The book has many questions and samples to work through that are fun, and are representative of the kinds of questions that some of the more technical interviews ask.<br /><br />I used the book to prepare for an Amazon interview and it greatly helped me in preparing for the technical questions that would be asked during the interview. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to better their technical interview performance.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|The writing and acting in this movie is surprisingly good.  Nothing feels forced...the cast blended well together with the exception of Nick Fury's go-to agent...her high pitch voice trying to sound 'solid' is a bit annoying but thankfully her role is small.  Hints of comedy accompany scenes with seamless one liners.  I'm not a comic con person but am impressed with the action scenes and how the stories are intertwined to bring you The Avengers.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read this year.  I loved this book and would highly recommend it.  I was obsessively reading it all weekend- I even turned my kindle to &#34;text to speech&#34; so I could listen to it in the car.  It is one of those books where you &#34;miss&#34; the characters when you finish and I immediately looked up for anything else the author had written as I loved this story so much and had devoured it so fast.

B000001FMX|5.0|I love this record.  If you love punk rock you must have this.  These guys influenced the Ramones.  David Johansson's voice and swagger are so much fun - as far as front men go, you don't get any better.  It is Johnny Thunders, for goodness sake...what else needs to be said???  This is such a fun record and highly under appreciated.  Great, great music.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites, and the back-of-the-box description really doesn't do it justice. Yes, the main character is a cyclist, but that's not what the movie is about. It's about relationships, friends and family, and the awkward period of time after high school when you're legally an adult but still growing up.
B000002N2N|5.0|Great live Ramones stuff.  The sound is good, the setlist is good, it's the Ramones - 'Nuff said.  You can't go wrong with this record - total fun (and you get to hear DeeDee shout 1-2-3-4 28 times!).

Got me wondering so I googled real vs fake and found the following video.  Very, very subtle differences, but the one from Amazon is a fake! I hope amazon will return it.  My first indication was when I went online to verify that I watched the videos it told me my id number in the case was not real.  I still want a lifeproof case, as my boss has a great one, but I will make sure it is a REAL one and order directly from Lifeprooof.  [...]
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The cinematography is outstanding.  The actors do a phenomenal job and the story is extremely engaging. There is nothing deficient in this show.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Characters ageing but great addition to the cast. We really enjoyed the story and did not want the movie to end.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I like the show. I watched on TV about 6 mths ago. And now I want to have the DVD.
B00A77II0U|4.0|very entertaining, once I started it was hard go put down. I would like go see more games like this with higher levelof difficulty
B000XO2R22|5.0|Brilliant. Dylan-Gordonlightfootesque. Just when you think you have him figured out he goes beyond genre. Takes you back to place you've never been, yet seems so familiar. A must-have.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The Polar Express is a delightful story of BELIEVING in the magic of Christmas.....for the kid in all of us!

B005KMX866|5.0|Been a big Chris Isaak fan for many, many years. This has to be one of his best albums yet. Rates up there with Baja Nights. Got 2 cds. One for me and one for a gift for my boss. He loved it also.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|my favorite MJ video/shirt movie ever. the blu-ray itself turned out surprisingly good too! MJ will always be the king.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|my husband loves watching this classic series  with the amount of time he spends traveling, it was the perfect gift for him
B004EBZX6W|2.0|I don't see the point if this app sorry it seems redundant to me. My phone shows me what wifi signals are around
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|I saw this movie and it was great plus my brother plays in this movie in the fight seen when they bet Hugh Jackman up. My brother is a actor  kinda and has been in a few movies in small part and that is one of the other reasons why I am buying this movie.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This movie is full of witty dialogue, great characters and strangely perfect ending.  Each actor fits there role extremely well.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I have read and saw the movies and history on these guys and would have to say they had BALLs This movie is great and I would buy it for the price.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I saw the movie first and loved it.  Then I decided to read the book.  It was a quick read for me as I enjoyed it so much.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I saw this movie at the drive in and on CD. I thought for the price it would be great and fun to watch I love the movie and it is one of my favorits
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have nothing other to say than that this was truly fantastic.<br />This review requires me to use more words, so I'll just say that I am looking forward to reading more of Green's work.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this app is a great time waster for people of all ages. once in a while there is a challenge, but it is really just for fun. enjoy
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun game and the comments/story are funny too, So I would give it a five star. The Pirate comments are also funny..
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I had seen this movie at the cinema and like it.  Therefore I bought it.  I would deinitely recommend this product.  --  GREG
B0002XV30Q|5.0|I have been collecting the recordings of Saint-Saens' music for 50 years, and have had this set since it first came on the market. These concerti are all superb and wonderfully varied. Like all great music they reward repeated hearings and different interpretations. I find that these performances are among the very best. Collard and Previn are well matched in service of the music- and best of all, they take a romantic approach, Collard takes the gorgeous central section of No 4 slower than most and the exceptional beauty of the music comes through, just one of many striking moments. His technique is stupendous. I would not be without this set of these 5 great concerti. Other wonderful sets are the Roge/Dutoit and the recent Malikova/Sanderling. Both show different approaches that are very rewarding. I was so disappointed in the Hough recordings that I got rid of the set! Hough flies by most of the music- and the orchestra is not well recorded (the ravishing second movement of the Fifth Concerto is probably the worst in Hough's set- all I could think was \\"where's the fire!\\")<br /><br />This set will reward years of repeated hearings, each time revealing new insights.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|We can only hope that you've seen \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" and \\"Albino Alligator\\" at this point. Because \\"Inside Man\\" has joined their ranks as a film about surrounded criminals with no way out! Clive Owen is the masked mastermind behind the robbery, and he's one step ahead of all of us. Denzel is the detective on the scene, but he's already in hot water with the NYC top dogs. Foster is the....inside man possibly. Her client (Plummer) has a vested interest in resolving the robbery standoff and recovering certain items from the real Inside Man, but will her persausion work on Denzel and/or Clive? We must pay strict attention to the happenings inside the bank, especially involving Clive. But, inside or outside of the bank it's hard to tell who's a good guy and who's a bad guy. Victim or suspect? Police or Criminal? Of course, the story being set in NYC makes it even more difficult to answer those questions. But here's an answer: Spike Lee delivers! \\"Inside Man\\" is a must see for Bank Heist Film fans and anyone who follows Clive, Denzel, Spike Lee and NYC.<br /><br />2.342
B0036OS3H4|2.0|It is a comfortable boot, but I can't really call it a winter boot since it does not stay dry. The seams between the rubber part in the bottom and the sides are not waterproof. And since the seam is placed very low, even stepping in a small puddle results in wet socks and feet.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great story...can't wait for the next one<br />Never disappointing.<br />Making my husband read it too.<br />Fast paced and interesting the whole way through
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Tom Clancy should fire his associate writer for &#34;Threat Vector&#34;.  He is obviously used primarily to add fill-in fluff.  In addition, the story line is so unbelievable it's insulting.  The Chinese president and General Su insulted my intelligence with their actions and maneuverings, and &#34;Central&#34; was unbelievable.  I will never buy another Tom Clancy novel that has another novelist as a byline, and I will also be very cautious before I buy any other Tom Clancy novel.
B005723JSQ|3.0|Good story.  Very light and not intense. Easy read, entertaining  and funny.  I always enjoy Sophie Kinsella and the humor of the characters.
1439127700|3.0|Too much time was devoted to the Johnson and Nixon era clubs. Would have liked more about the current club members.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I purchased this product to track blood sugar and blood pressure on the go because it is supposed to be Microsoft compatable. It totally destroys date formats no matter how many times I load the file from my computer.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product at all to anyone for any reason!!!
1601251831|4.0|This book covers most of the monsters that are a staple of pen and paper RPGs.  The monster stats are well layed out.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I guess the game is alright, and maybe my aim isn't the greatest, but I'm not that crazy about playing this game, I tried it out of curiosity, but think I'd rather spend my time playing something else.
B006RXQ3GO|4.0|All the ladies liked it.  I had seen it before. That is all I have to say.  Happy new year
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Real cool games nd fun omg awesome try it your self I dare you lol blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
1601252463|4.0|The additional classe options offer a new level of variety in gameplay.  The rule mechanics are sound.  The book artwork is OK.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|This movie sucessfully engages you with a seemingly cliche time travel dialogue with top notch performances by both Levitt and Willis. Then Emma Stone enters the movie. Brilliant screenwriting and untouchable special effects. BRAVO!
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Having grown up hearing the sweet sounds of ELO on an old single speaker radio, this homage to the songs Jeff Lynne enjoyed as a child is a genuine pleasure.<br /><br />The songs are wonderful - presented in Lynne's melodically lovely, upbeat fashion.  This collection will be enjoyed by anyone with a heartbeat  (and possibly those without one.)<br /><br />God had a 'Blue Sky' day when he gave us Jeff Lynne.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Lady GaGa is one of the best musican/ singer out there and boy can she write songs about boyfriends and or religous things.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute and fun escapist story. There is a bit of formula to it (uber-rich and psychologically damaged businessman falls for not so financially stable woman and then takes over her life; can you say FSOG, The Blackstone Affair, This Man....) but it's a more vanilla take on things, a light read and you can't beat the price.
B000031XCR|5.0|I would  recommand this cd to someone who loved the movie Titantic because Celine Dion has one of the best vocals of my lifetime.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book...Will make you grab the third one immediately! Can't wait to see how the story ends, what a trilogy!
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Really good singing and great lyrics from this candaian singer- songwritter and also Justin Bieber had found this great person who had came out with one of the best songs of 2012
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I have published only one book on Kindle and this was the biggest source of help I had. Not having any experience before hand, I was able to do it with little to no other outside aid.
0061801313|5.0|Best well written book series about 4 teenaged girls who are friends who keep on getting strange messages from this person or group of people that say &#34;you better do what I say or else I will tell everyone your little secret.&#34;
B00846F1YW|1.0|Nevosoft...Fix it or give me my money back!<br />I cant believe I have to come up with more words. Still not enough.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I expected something less soulful and more sophisticated.  I will listen a few more times before writing it off.  I guess I should have read other reviews.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Much of her thought processes reminds me of my own. I like how available she makes herself to the reader. It is a very humorous book and she has a lot of wisdom to share. On the surface, though, she probably seems like a mean b#tch, but I still admire her.
B00756GKBA|4.0|Hard and sophisticated.  Its better than a couple of Madonna's recent attempts but not the top of the charts.  give it a try.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this movie for my infant. Ok, so he doesn't really &#34;get&#34; movies yet. But he does enjoy music and colorful cartoons. This movie is a visual treat for both of us, and the message is really important. I will definitely play this one for many years.
B007SGM084|5.0|all i can say is that it is a cant put down book  great read but a little naughty.<br />love it.
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|Good old blues with nasty, dirty guitars and a dash of funk thrown in here and there. If Led Zepelin and Muddy Waters had a baby, it'd be this album.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|First off I really love musicals and ABBA music. This musical is really bad. The only one who can sing is the girl who plays the daughter. Everyone else just looks uncomfortable to be there  - especially Brosnan. The acting is terrible...very campy.  I was actually embarrassed for the actors/actresses while I watched it. It was like they realized part way through filming that since no one could act or sing they should make it as cheesy as possible. I would rent this instead of buying it if you feel you have to see it.....buying it is just a waste of money. It's a just ghastly train wreck!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I think that this book could have been better than what it was. It was still a good read, with a lot of angst. He was a little to hard headed and back and forth for me. I would have left him long before she did.<br /><br />Thats all that i will say except there is a HEA.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Great follow-up to the first one. There were a few slow segments, but didn't stop the flow of the movie.
1465001123|5.0|This calendar is one of my favorites! The pictures in it aren't always super special but it's nice! It came quickly (2 day delivery) and was worth the money! Bought it so I could count down the days till I see her live. :)
B008EQIA7W|3.0|It was an okay movie. Not as much action as the original, and kind of slow as well. Still enjoyed.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I found it easy to go through game and only had to check the hints a few times. Mainly because occassionally it was unclear as to the next step...not overtly logical sometimes. The only real problem was the annoyance of having to constantly go from one end of the scenes to the other...over and over again. still it was enjoyable and relaxing. It is not complex and does not demand a lot of brain testing.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Received this movie after purchase in just a couple of days. The movie is supposed to be a prequel to Alien, but for me I didn't really get that feel from it and just like to think of it as an awesome stand-alone sci fi movie.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is decent game, and I think the price of the full version is quite reasonable compared to some. The Facebook prompts are a little annoying, but I can ignore them easy enough.  The biggest issue I have with g5 games is every once in a while one of the clues will be vague or confusing ('burner' for a torch or just 'clipper' when there are several types of clippers). Still a fun game, though.
B005HSL626|5.0|I was amazed at how easy this game was and that my 4 year old loved it! It is a lot of fun!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app. is exactly what i was looking for. It gives me fast access to the info I need.  In one word perfect.
0525953728|5.0|this is a great easy to read book, think it is close to what really happened on the ground these were brave men
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I cant stop!!! The more I play the more I want to see those coins and prizes fall. This is my new favorite game.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Loaded this as part of the solution to get Adobe Flash on my kindle. so far it paritally works.<br />to get the flash loaded on the kindle
0812984412|4.0|This was another book club book and for once I actually finished the book.  My favorite parts were the futuristic sections and especially future Hawaii after `The Fall'.  I liked that best because I do a fair amount of reading into the ancient past and what is interesting to me is the cyclical fall of civilization and empires from cycles of plague and cosmic catastrophe that have happened in the past.  It is bound to happen again whether in our lifetimes or not.  So to read the authors take on how the future unfolded through the eyes and story of an inhabitant of Hawaii was most entertaining.  I didn't catch the exact meaning the author was trying to portray with life connections and if I hadn't read about the book because of the movie then I would have been even more in the dark on this aspect.  Overall, not bad for fiction and I'll eventually get around to reading another book by the author.  Recommended.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|got it for xmas for my nephew he can't stop using it, and i was able to use my discover miles for purchasing it
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I can't understand the negative feedback for this book.. As far as I'm concerned this book was excellent as always.. I read a lot and have never found one of Lee Child's books to be predictable or boring.. The same for this new one.. I just hope he keeps on with writing because I'm looking forward to the next Jack Reacher .. I do have to agree with everyone it was a shame to put Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher, in fact it was pitiful..
0307155102|5.0|I have given this book many times to first time parents.  We read from it every day and my son is now a NeuroScientist.  Each picture is done with nice detail so there is always so many discussions filled with learning opportunity for your child.  I would highly recommend this book as it will provide many wonderful times together with your child and or children. Take 5 minutes or 45 minutes, and give the gift of time and learning.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This was a good movie with good acting and great casting choices. I would definitely recommend it! You will truly enjoy :)
B006LSZECO|1.0|The story hooks a reader with its deep first person point of view and alternating voices: well done, sharp, harsh narcissistic, neurotic. Extremes meet, dance, enact their own Venus Flytrap version of call and response, and then devour one another. Before long, the relentlessly self-referential rant in both voices, and both voices channeling the authorial voice, feels like the verbal equivalent of watching kudzu strangle a Sweet Gum sapling. It's a morbidly fascinating view into symbiosis as mutually-assured destruction; a cause for reflection, in a natural history of literary oddities sort of way. Difficult to sustain and nearly impossible to create character arcs with satisfactory closure. There is something too self-satisfied and self-referential in the way it self-cannibalizes its characters' stories at the end, announcing the sequels to come.<br />Smart, sharp and harsh.<br />But can a thriller continue to thrill when both main characters are such self-hugging antagonists?<br />Not for this reader.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It is amazing!! You get to draw whatever you choose and you can play with friends. And you can also play with random people that you can talk to, too!!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Cool seeing Sly and the gang keeping it real with the action hero genre.  A recommended rental and a must have for action movie buffs.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I am exactly in the middle of the book, and find it hard to put down.<br />It's a page-turner.  If you don't mind the interruptions (tales aren't<br />finished in chronological order), which I don't, you will find this book<br />very interesting and entertaining AND thought-provoking.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Bats is at it again saving Gotham.  This is a must see for the Batman enthusiast..  I wish it would have had a &#34;nod&#34; to the &#34;rumored&#34; Justice League movie(s)  This is the last time (we are told) that Christian Bale will done the Cape and Cowl.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I particularly like the references to King`s other works.  In the fact that he avoided the most basic of pitfalls (attempting to postulate a solution to the assassination), he writes a very intriguing book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the same version that you see on your home computer or laptop.  Perfect for your device!  Must have!
B0053O89U6|5.0|Makes me laugh so hard! It is one of the best shows on television today and I only hope they can keep up the humor
B0054JZC6E|1.0|They let you play games only with points you win from previous games, so if you run out of point, you have to pay to play.  Not really free that way!
B000062V9C|3.0|With no one's fault other than my own...I had no idea that Region 2 meant it would not play on an American DVD player.  So needless to say it's not very good for us
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great version of Spider Solitare.  It is just like the one on your home computer or laptop.
0439023491|5.0|This is an excellent book! I received it on time for a good price. I can't wait to see the Catching Fire Movie! I recommend the entire Mocking Jay series!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It is not the same Mahjong app that is for apple products but you can still play different levels and layouts.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|This was a perfect small xmas gift. I cannot review the movie. I have not watched it. If you know you want this movie, absolitely order from this seller.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Well this is coming from someone whose never read any of the books. I had no clue what this movie was even about before I watched it. Well, it ended up being a pretty good movie. I would recommend it to everyone I know.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|We got this movie on time for a great price! This is an excellent film! I hope it is able to win somekind of Oscar.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|This lightweight cover adds protection for your tablet and a handy built in stand. The elastic closure is sturdy. The interior is soft. A plastic frame is fitted into one side to hold the tablet. Very glad I chose it.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I think I'm going to end up writing a mostly critical review of a book that I really liked. Odd, I know.<br /><br />1. I'm afraid my judgement might be clouded by the excerpt from the second book in the series that I read immediately following this book. I thought the excerpt, which is in Will's voice, seemed kind of really cheesy. But I will still obviously read the second book.<br /><br />2. I fail to understand why this has been cited as being one of the leaders (for lack of a better word) in this new \\"new adult\\" genre. To me this read like pretty traditional YA, besides the ages of the main character (18) and her love interest (21). Otherwise there was no sex, no drugs, no drinking, no cursing (that I remember, correct me if I'm wrong), and no violence. And death is a pretty common theme in traditional YA.<br /><br />3. The cover is so bad, I can't believe S&S didn't change that. (I am highly critical of covers though.)<br /><br />Ok, that's all the bad. Now the good (I'm in a list mood).<br /><br />1. Th entire story was so relatable and felt so real. Both the story lines and the characters seemed like people I could know and things that could happen to me or people I know.<br /><br />2. It's a really interesting premise that I honestly can't believe no one has thought of before. I won't spoil it, but the thing that shakes up Layken and Will's relationship is so simple yet so devastating.<br /><br />3. I even enjoyed the poetry and I never thought I would say that. I hate, hate, hate poetry and I find people who are so into poetry completely pretentious (just telling the truth) which is one of the reasons I put off reading this for a while. But I actually loved the poetry in this book. I thought the poems were really creative and the perfect outlet for teenagers.<br /><br />That's my bad and good. I really did like the book, I read it in a couple of hours and I just couldn't put it down. There were times I laughed out loud and times where my eyes filled with tears so it definitely affected me. I will also say I thought it was extremely well-written, I've found certain books in this genre to be lacking in writing finesse, but Slammed was great. In fact I got to the part about \\"basagna\\" and I couldn't believe there was a typo! I got so annoyed before I realized that's how it was supposed to be written :)<br /><br />I should also say I'm excited that the film rights were optioned. Hopefully it does end up getting made into a movie and that Hollywood doesn't totally teen-movie cheese it up.ars so it definitely affected me.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its like timple run buy more fun.I got cause my friend had it too.I think it is really good for kids.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I was fully prepared to give this book 3 stars the entire time I was reading it, but then I got to the end and I loved the end so much that I think it deserves 4 starts. I'm not going to ruin the end, but I will give a few thoughts on the book overall.<br /><br />I didn't love the main character. I'm all about reading books with flawed characters (who wants to read about someone perfect, right?), but I have problems with characters who take no responsibility for their own actions, which is how I saw Serena. She even says, at one point (and I'm paraphrasing), that things just happen to her, she doesn't make decisions, which drives me crazy.<br /><br />The prose in the book is very Ian McEwan and there were definitely some very descriptive parts that I found myself glossing over. I also had mixed feelings about Tom's stories that were included in part or in full. I found myself enjoying some and no others and I don't really know if they were necessary to include.<br /><br />But it is a very interesting, if maybe improbable story, that I would recommend overall, but especially for the ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely AMAZING!! Hopeless is by far one of the best books I have read this year! Ms. Colleen Hoover you have exceeded my expectations and dare I say I liked this even more than you previous books.<br /><br />I am totally in live with Holder...
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Beter than I expected it to be. Even my husband thought it was good, even if it was a &#34;chick flick.&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't stop reading and hope that the story keeps going. Will be looking for more titles from this author right now.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|Find a local college radio station to hear the real music before big business takes over all the airways - or hit the search button on your satellite radio and explore everything. Make it your own not what someone else tells you is cool. If the music speaks to you and is honest, not gimmicky or aimed at the lowest common denominator go for it enjoy it and see them live in a small club. That's the real grass roots music scene. Always has been always will be. Think for yourself. This is just all marketing based on product testing and past unit sales generated by coordinated hype in an effort to separate you from your money as quickly as possible. There's no integrity here the sounds from this disc are about money.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like seeing how much time I have left depending on what I am doing.  Differs by app. Very handy.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I saw on the other reviews that people complained about the ads. In all honesty, I didn't even notice them but maybe I'm just so used to them in everything.  I like the game.  It has a story theme if you like that sort of thing. Because of the story theme, the tiles change every five or so puzzles. So once you sort of learn the tiles and get really fast they change so it keeps it challenging.  The puzzles are pretty easy to clear and I can usually finish each one in four to eight minutes...so it's my go to game when I have a few minutes to clear. I run it on my kindle fire he and haven't had any problems with it crashing.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|If you like the male/female groups with tight harmonies (Lady Antebellum, Little Big Town, Sugarland), this is another group for you. The sister/brothers team wrote or co-wrote several of the cuts. It's a very musical album, not just country-pop to gain radio airplay (which they've done anyway). My favorite cut is the hit &#34;Postcard From Paris,&#34; not just because of the great harmonies but also because the lyrics cover the &#34;what might have happened if . . . &#34; part of life.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|We bought this for our granddaughter.  They didn't have these when our children were small but the baby loves it!  We would recommend it to others.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|IT'S PERFECT FOR MY KINDLE VERY EASY TO PLAY ON IT . WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO OWNS A KINDLE.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Well worth the money. Lots of hidden objects great puzzles and clues to collect to solve the mystery. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was an unexpected find.  I love Sci-Fi, but the genre is getting a bit worn out with bad stories and social engineering.<br /><br />Weir's book has emotion and action, and it is easy for the reader to suspend disbelief.  The story becomes real and it is hard to find places to stop reading.  The science involved is believable.  I have a strong background in physics and chemistry, but I'm not going to push the envelope and try and see if there are errors.  The story was amazingly believable.  I thought the sand storm near the end might be the end of the book.<br /><br />In many books where there is a lot of emotion, you tell yourself, \\"This is just a book.  The hero always survives, right?\\"  Throughout, I was never certain how the book would end and I won't spoil the ending, but towards the end I was with billions of people of Earth rooting for the outcome I wanted.<br /><br />I read a lot of books (several a week), and it was such a please to find an inexpensive book that made reading pleasurable again.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Intriguing and gripping.  A hopeful story despite its tragedies. Couldn't put it down, and I still don't know what to believe, but the reader is called upon to make a choice.
0545275326|5.0|Thank you!  Great series.  My son loves it and is reading from it every day!  It is a great series for kids.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Started and finished in 2 days. Draws you in quite fast and holds you till the last sentence. Read it.
075669812X|5.0|My grandson needed some new reading material that he was interested in, and this was it, a great find for him!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Incredible, wonderful! beautiful - this was the best I have seen in years and years.  I love the character and it has something for everyone.  while children love it - I believe it is a story for adults with wonderful messages. It has such magic!! Please do yourself a favor and buy it for your library
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Works great and cushions my Kindle Fire when I drop it.  What more can you expect from a case?<br />Would recommend this.
B009VB97EY|5.0|It's not a cinematic masterpiece, but it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a movie about male strippers.  It's a great girl's night out movie.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|fun light escape movie for the holidays and long weekends<br />especially with Arnold, Chuck and Bruce.<br />better than the first movie
B007URVZJ6|3.0|The project I was trying had too many graphics to work on Kindle.  The book would work for text only publications, but was not adequate for what I needed.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|More for the novelty. Not near as good as the original. Fun play but way too easy. Should include path of the Jedi with purchase. That would have made it worth the two bucks.
B009157BWU|5.0|It was facinating to watch the movie and the interaction between the chimpanzees.  It was an excellent movie for the entire family
B001AZI1W8|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase of this dvd.  Plays well.  Price was great too.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Shipment came on time and in great shape.  I would buy from the seller again.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was entertaining and the music and comedy were extremely good. A great family movie. I love watching acapello singing.
B008NW67E0|5.0|It starts out a little slower than their debut album, but once you give it a little more of a listen, you won't want to take it out of your cd player!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The script left a lot to be desired in this one.  The other Bourne movies were much better.  Relied too much on the action and too little on the plot.
140911631X|4.0|As usual I received this book from GoodReads as part of a giveaway. Also as usual, despite the very kind and generous consideration of getting a free book, I give my candid opinions below.<br /><br />The year is 1986.  Eleanor, a teenager abused by her stepfather and neglected by her desperate mother, meets Park, a nice, normal boy of the grunge set.  The rest is left as an exercise to our potential reader.<br /><br />Qualitatively speaking, I found Rowell's rendering of this all-too-common situation uncommonly realistic.  Having myself been a boy immersed in new love many ages ago, her descriptions of the all-encompassing palpitations of youthful amour rang with truth.  Her style is easy to assimilate and makes for a quick and leisurely read.  She also renders her chosen setting, 1986 Omaha, with skill and accuracy.<br /><br />I will say that as a 'young adult' novel, which I believe this to be designated by the publisher, it comes off a bit strong.  There is little content of a directly sexual nature but the profusion of four letter words is bothersome.  I suppose it depends on what your definition of 'young adult' is but I'd feel a bit wrong handing this to my daughters until they are late in their teens.<br /><br />In summary, Rowell does a great job of capturing that spark of youthful love that we all hopefully find at some point in our lives.  Her characters are well rendered and one could easily believe she knew these people in real life (as I suspect she did).  It captures well the fleeting and potent emotions of youthful love.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book. I saw the movie first and then read this and it was an amazing read. Can't wait to read the next
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Such a great story. Makes you want to find a true love like they did lol. Even though it's all a fantasy.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Have had a couple of these over the years, nice economical workout headphones that allow hearing of other noises also.<br /><br />Prompt shipment, no problems.
B004SBX112|1.0|I would have enjoyed trying this game, but it was never sent to my kindle.The ninety nine cents was deducted from my account.  :-(
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|i enjoyed the game until i found you only get 3 birds.  Thats not enough to truly enjoy the game.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I would have also enjoyed playing this game,but it was never sent to my kindle.The price was deducted from my account.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I went into this book with a very open mind. I am willing to hear from a scientist when it comes to the idea of an afterlife. This book may have changed what I think is possible about heaven. Everyone from skeptics to true believers need to read this book. I discovered the book at a difficult point in my own spiritual life and it has given me hope that I've almost never had.
B0086700CM|1.0|its okay don't buy it beacase it won't download behyzyyd hrhud hdhud hfjfhhfyf heyydyf hdhhryt hrryyr hrhhyr hrhyr hfhgt gt hhgfhdhsjeihey hey
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Almost impossible to put down, although it does contain some Stephen King weirdness (\\"jimla\\", anyone?) that doesn't seem to go anywhere. But I loved the characters and I think it would be a fantastic film.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Every issue it had has been fixed it works really great now. Happy that now i won't get notifications 15 minutes late.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|If you want an engrossing, well-paced movie for a Friday evening this is it. The sheer scale and detail of the fx designer's imagination is what deserves applause.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very moving, I didn't get bored one time. I absolutely loved it and you would love it too.
B0064W67IM|4.0|This was the first digital comic I've read and it was very intriguing.  The digital medium didn't detract from the art and the story was quite addicting to read.  Can't wait to read the rest.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought it just left you hanging at the end of the book. I wanted to know a little more information about Greg at the end. But other than that I thought it was an ok book
B005LAIH4A|5.0|whats not to love . my 18mo and 4yr old grandsons were gluded to the movie.loved it,good story no vilonce.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love it amazing to the top limited to be able to be a little bit about the rec and other
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A warm, and inspiring story. It should be read often so we don't forget that Christ did come to bring peace on earth and goodwill to men. If we allow him into our lives and hearts.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I ran across Paper Towns after reading TFIOS,another book by John Greene. Both books have taught me so much about myself as a person. I have never been one able to separate myself from a work that I have read. The people become part of me and teach me lessons in which I feel the author meant for me to learn. Each person must learn their own lesson. As for me, I recommend John Greene's books to all.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|That was fun having been a teen in the 80's. Wanted to force my kids to watch it. Between this, Dazed and Confused, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High the 70/80 generation is documented for history.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|good book, short and easy to read on my kindle (tecnically a kindle app on my iPad). But nice, easy and a good read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a good book, and nice to know it was free thanks to my prime membership and the kindle learners' library.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This is such a good book, and compared to some of the duds I've been getting halfway through only to abandon them lately... well, what a relief. The characters are likeable and multifaceted. The plot is well-crafted and does that really satisfying thing where details and minor events from earlier in the book turn out to be important in the end. But the absolute best part is the world. The alchemy, clockworks, elderglass... it's a place I want to return to over and over, which means Scott Lynch has gained a loyal reader in me. The last time I felt this way about a world it was Jacqueline Carey's Terre D'Ange. And that was a while ago (I also really loved McCaffrey's Pern).<br /><br />My only quibble is with one character who seems to serve the same purpose as Wilson the neighbor in those old Home Improvement episodes--you know the one, you never see more than his eyes peeking over the fence? There's a character in this book who is only ever referenced, and while she would seem to be pretty important to the main character, you never get to meet her. I kept expecting her to turn up at some point. But hey, as flaws in a novel go, this is pretty minor.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to anyone who like adventure stories, although be aware that there's some pretty harsh violence from time to time. It's not for little kids.
0316227706|5.0|after a hard day at work or when you have stress on your mind.  flip open this book and your worries melt away.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|This blu-ray didn't actually SAY it was blu-ray. When ordering this disc, I saw the blue bar across the top of the box but didn't notice the bar did not say &#34;Blu-ray&#34;.  When it arrived, I worried that I had gotten the wrong version.  The only clue was that the back of the box listed the frame aspect ration as 2:40:1. Odd.  Other than this, it arrived sooner than expected and was in perfect shape.
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|Trailer told me: time travel and Bruce Willis. Bruce as a \\"Terminator variation\\" perhaps?? Well, sort of. Have to pay attention (too much perhaps?) to get plot line sorted out and in the mean time, characters I don't much care for other than the Mom. Movie is ok as did not either hate or love it. Watch it a second time? Nope. Recommend it to another? Nope.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This was a decent action flick.  The movie moves forward and backwards in time through a series of flashbacks so you'll be confused if you step away from the screen to grab a snack. There were some really violent scenes that may be too intense for kids and squeamish adults.  You won't be bored watching this film and you may need to pause it so you can catch your breath during some of the chase scenes.  Enjoy!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Rented as \\"chick flick\\" for my wife and after we watched it, \\"She liked it\\" and she has not said that in months and months of chick flicks. SO, this could be an excellent \\"date night\\" flick as it has enough for the \\"chick\\" and enough Eastwood and baseball to keep you from falling asleep. My only negative is that the plot, character interactions, are so bloody predictable. There is not one surprise in the movie and it must have been written by a TV script writer because in the last 10 minutes, everything and I mean everything, comes together, resolves..... UGH! Enjoyable. For the chick in your life.
0316287059|4.0|Fresh work, but not much new from his two previous books. (I have all three.) The cover is, if you `get it' is a great example of Kevyn's ability to see what we would have never seen. Kiara Kabukuri and Amber Valetta \\"...in a dual composit image that `suggets' the merging of the world's races.\\" His concept here is an excellent representation of his uncanny ability to see beyond the obvious. If you can look at this book (or his two previous books) with this same `eye' as Kevyn did possess, then you can fully appreciate his book (s). A great example is of `Linda Evangelista' on pp. 144-145 (actually Alex Peruzzi) done up like Linda from his The Art of Makeup p.111. The resemblance is unbelievable. So do not expect to get an incredible makeup lesson here, this is just a vehicle to showcase more of his incredible work.<br /><br />Bottom line: A must-have for any MUA's inspiration library.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Could have used a time edit (2 hours +) but plenty of car crashes, bomb explosions, gun fire, ACTION, ACTION, ACTION. On a cold winter's night, it will do.
0316286850|4.0|I have reviewed all three of Kevyn's book, and this review is much the same. Do not expect to learn anything specific that will give you inside knowledge on how to do looks like Kevyn has. He tells you how he basically applied the makeup, but only in general terms. Comparing Kevyn's work to many other MUA's (makeup artist's), Kevyn was a genius. He could see a face, and the potential that one would only believe after they see his results. His books are for a MUA's coffee table or inspiration library. Many of the pictures look retouched, so they are not a true representation of how the subject looked. For example, you do not get a fair glimpse on how the makeup sits on the skin, how heavy it is applied, how some imperfections are addressed. So his work always looks perfect, which is a fair representation of the end-product results. (High-fashion and celebrity work for glossy spreads.) Much has changed in the last dozen years in the world of makeup products, so I wouldn't consider the instruction in this book to be up-to-date for 2012.<br /><br />Bottom line: Useful for an inspiration library, but do not expect to replicate any of Kevyn's looks. Kevyn was a genius and could see things in face that most never could.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Liked original but this....just can not get through it. Have started it several times and seems like all action and no plot. If you do not know the first one, not sure you going to get this one and I found special effects a bit weak. Watch the orginal and skip this one.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is a great book. Entertaining to read but I didn't give it a full rating because I was a little disappointed in the ending. I wanted to know more!! Looking forward to reading the next book if the trilogy!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is a lot of fun trying to get a better time for each game. Best Mahjong game I have ever played.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is so wonderful and makes my belly laugh,  She is a great writer as well as a comedian. LOVE!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was interesting, entertaining, and enjoyable!  It was easy to get invested in the story and hard to put down. I highly recommend it!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|While I'm not a huge fan of docu-drama type films and mini-series, this one ranks as one of the best I've ever seen. The cast does a really outstanding job. I have to admit I was skeptical at seeing Paul Giamatti in a role like this since I'm really used to him in a more comic role. But I'd say he really nailed it in this series. Others like Laura Linney as Abigail Adams and David Morse as George Washington lend to a very enjoyable and enlightening experience. I can honestly say I really didn't have a good appreciation for this time period in history before viewing this series. Though I studied these events in history class, this series gave me such a better understanding about how difficult things really were at that time. Having just returned from Boston, and standing at the site of the Boston Massacre, it brought back memories of the series and how John Adams came to the defense of the very soldiers that threatened their way of life. If you want to have a better understanding of this pivotal time in US history and want to enjoy some great acting, consider watching this series.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|This was a very creative movie for kids. Loved the story and the claymation.  My son also loves it and we have already watched it several times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game will make you think. It's great for kids. It's addicting to all ages. It's a mind blowing game.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Trailer is deceiving. This movie is NOT fast paced and well written.  The stars must have been desperate for money as there is nothing about the 20 minutes of this movie I could stand to watch that justified any actor with judgement to have agreed to play in this stinker.  Don't waste your time and money.
B00A0HQ7H8|3.0|not as good and intense as the debut album.<br />Tracks 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 are good. I didn't like<br />track 4 and 7 found them to be too repetitive. Didn't like<br />track 5, sounds too much like a Christmas song.<br />Her debut album was released on January, 2012 and this<br />EP album was released on November, 2012.  So I'm guessing<br />that this EP album was not as great as the the debut album<br />because of the brief time between the two albums and thus<br />less time working on the songs.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|Another great translation to BluRay! This is a really great movie in the surperior quality in high definition! I recommend this purchase.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Usually an album has only a few good songs and most are just filler songs. Very rarely do you find an album that<br />you can sit down and listen to from start to end. \\"Born to Die\\" is that very rare gem that you can actually<br />sit down and listen to it in its entirety. Every single song on this album is good. I recently discovered Lana Del Rey through the Amazon recommendation, and I can not stop listening to the album. I have been listening to the entire album at least twice a day. There is just something about her voice, music that really click with me. Her music is kind of similar to another singer called Diamond Rings(listen to the album called \\"Special Affections\\"), although I think she is much better and I enjoyed her album much more.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. He writes so honest it breaks my heart and reminds me of the times when I felt infinite.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Without cable or dsl at home (as many folks choose these days'), there becomes no way to see these videos other than on ones' phone.  Great, however this leads to a viewing experience that is less than satisfactory at times,  and totally inadequate, or just inconvenient/impossible at others. With streaming media devices attached to tv's now,  and this being a more preferred way to view this media type, there is a real need for a program such as this, and I for one,  am glad to have found it, and embrace it as a very good and functional tool.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is great for the amateur photography and even a pro. For me it holds my camera body, lens attached, two more lenses, my light sphere, and my flash. The additional pockets hold my additional memory cards and batteries. I highly recommend this bag.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Hard to find in the stores. Great purchase and nice to own a copy of an incredible movie.  Nice packaging on DVD
B007SUW24W|5.0|First time I heard Ed, I thought who is this Jason Mraz Knock off.  But I will say this he would have to give a hat's off to Jason, but he actually flows waaaayyy more smooth.  His ability to tell story's and give a great chorus is way more mature than you would expect from some one so young.  And best of all every song on this album is  tolerable if not great.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies! Such vivid color and imagery. I love things full of magic and message. It's beautiful.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I read this year's ago and loved it then.  I enjoyed reading it again, wonderful book! This was the first book I read on my kindle, awesome!
0071766588|5.0|Bought this for a friend in Mexico in order to prep him for the TOEFL. He has nothing but good things to say about it.
B009P13RQY|5.0|I just discovered this band the other day, but I've listened to this cd several times over the past few days and I like it better each time.  I agree with some other comments that they remind me of Black Sabbath, but they do so without sounding like they are copying Sabbath.  This is a tight band and you can tell how each of them are excellent musicians on the live tracks.  The music is muscular and very well produced.  If you like metal from the earlier days of the genre, you will like this, but in saying that, it is not just a remake or copy of anything, it's new and fresh but will remind the listener of several bands and sounds from the past. The lyrics are a somewhat gloomy at times, so you may have to be in a certain mood to listen, and that is why I would have given it 4.5 stars, but the lyrics tell the story so who am I to question their subject matter? The music rocks hard and has soul, muscle and groove.  I highly recommend this one.
0345803485|1.0|I need to really drag myself to finish this book, finally did it in 2 weeks, with 3-10 pages each time max, with so many skipping pages. It's kinda boring with many repetition of biting lips, roll over eyes etc.. Though I like some of the email parts (spoiler). Anyway, I can't see myself connect with this book and I don't know how I will finish the other two books! The good thing is I bought it from lightning deals, so don't hurt too much.
B000W21HB2|5.0|I don't feel the need to say a lot... this is a great record by one of the seminal bands of American southern / blues rock. (Any recording with Duane Allman playing is special.)  Their first album was perfect, this one is different, but stands up to the standard and actually raised the bar slightly.  This is a must for any Allman Brothers fan.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cord is so much nicer than the previous versions. i love how long it is, so you can charge from afar lol. great job Amazon!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun with a lot of variety. The only problem that I have with this game is that you need to gain a lot of points in order to unlock another game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this series my favorite books were the first 2 books.  They both flowed well and were exciting and written beautifully. my only complaint was the last book i found it to be depressing i t was written well but i thought it could of gone in a different direction but really overall i loved it and would recommend anyone to read it!!!!
B007N9FKCY|4.0|This game is really fun and it will keep me occupied for a long time. It gets really hard after a couple levels though.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I have been searching everywhere for this movie!  I was so happy with the cheap price and quickly delivery. this is one of my all time favorite movies!  One of the funnest romantic comedys i have every watched. you never stop laughing!!!<br />&#34;OHHHH?-- this-- problem---?&#34;
