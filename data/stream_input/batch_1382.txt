B002KDUDG6|5.0|I know I gush, but I've truly enjoyed every song I've ever hear Michael Buble perform.  He does not disappoint in concert (his talent is real, not studio fake), he puts on a very entertaining show.  His self-deprecating personality makes him more endearing and hearing the classic swing/Sinatra era songs in an updated version is exactly what I want to hear.
B005HSL626|1.0|do not get this app for your tablet it does not work like in the game it will just turn off
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Velvety smooth voice, amazing talent and all around great entertainer.  What is there not to like?  Do yourself a favor and see him in concert, you will NOT be disappointed!!

B005723JSQ|5.0|I really loved Twenties Girl, and this one is even better! This stand-alone had me laughing out loud, and racing to the end of the book. I loved Poppy, and Sam was a dream come true. Well done!

B004X2M3N8|5.0|The Doctor is back for another season in what has got to be one of BBC best shows.  Following the life of Amy (Amelia) Pond, many questions will be answered this season as the Doctor faces some of his biggest challenges yet.  A great cast and wonderful script make this show a number one in the hearts of millions of fans, myself included.<br /><br />If you like space travel, aliens, humor, or even just like british people, then this is the show for you!
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|This book, may have been a hit for many, But truthfully I found it tedious and unpleasant to read.<br />I cant quite put my finger on exactly what it was that caused me to feel this way, It felt like it was slow to get to the<br />heart of what it was truly about.<br /><br />The whole descriptive narrative was great, your really got a sense of doom and gloom, but something was just generally unpleasant about reading it/.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|it is awesome. it is fun. I like to knock over the red blocks. the controls are grate.I love the game.
1564148793|5.0|As a witch who works in an occult shop, I can say firsthand that this is THE book to have behind the counter.  It covers all forms of psychic attack, from ghosts to black magick to possession.  The author is obviously well informed and well practiced in his craft.  Most of the spells can be used by novices and adepts alike.  I feel that Protection and Reversal Magick beats anything coming from the mainstream publishers on the subject, and I recommend it to anyone who needs to do protection spells quickly and effectively.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is like playing in a arcade it has all kinds of cool games and nice points to earn.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the graphics are cool the controls are easy for my kids to use and I don't have to worry about having to supervised them
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Fits the Kindle perfectly and has a somewhat rubberized texture which makes the device easy to hold. Good design and very functional.  Wish other companies would offer this cover for their devices.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Plan on just canceling all your plans until the books are finished. I couldn't put it down once I started it!<br />The story of Katniss grips you from the beginning and doesn't let go!

B004EPYZT4|5.0|Conan the Barbarian (2011)<br /><br />I didn't watch this in the cinemas because I was not at all impressed with the previews and trailers. Watched it in regular DVD today. I actually liked it. There is good reason why.<br /><br />This one has no connection nor shared mythology with the wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of the 80s - this one is a good followup though it failed to reboot the franchise at the box office. It is a good pulp action movie. Everything you would expect from a costume-sword-sorcery-legend. I didn't like the first few minutes with the narration, they should have worked it into the plot. But I guess if they did that, they would have to make long drawn out boring trilogy like The Lord of the Rings which is still not as worse as the boring snoozefest written by Tolkien. But after that brief narration, when this movie starts, it starts in amazing style and drama. You have to watch it to realise it.<br /><br />This is an engaging remake of the original Conan the Barbarian movies. Much better production of course, thanks to improvement in technology and design. I don't understand the criticisms of this movie. Sure, it is a predictable pulp fiction plot. But that is why I am watching it, no? A real pulp no-holds-barred thrill.<br /><br />The pace is good. The story doesn't rush forward. It unfolds its plot well. The action is on a grand scale. Real war. Million times better than watching a bunch of dwarf kids running around with a magical ring in Middle Earth. Conan rises. He is the prodigal son born out of war and death. His father raises him under due discipline. But Conan has wild barbarian blood in him. The child actor playing the young Conan, Leo Howard is brilliant. He does a good job showing the cold-blooded brutality and harsh reality of a savage world of an ancient era. The man playing his father is also a very good character actor here. The son grows up alone and he seeks revenge. He slays and pillages and loots. He has comrades. Butthe man he seeks, he shall fight him alone. This raw energy is well portrayed by the actor Jason Momoa. He is a fresh change from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course the image of Arnold as Conan the Barbarian shall be imprinted on our minds forever. But see this movie as a new one, a fresh narration. Actor Jason Momoa is an athletic, intelligent and impressive man, not the bulging angry hulk that Arnold portrayed. Jason Momoa is also quite handsome and delivers his lines well with good amount of emotion and strength in his voice. That dialogue delivery alone takes him up a few notches to match up with the legend that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a more realistic depiction of an ancient warrior.<br /><br />During the making of the Arnold version of Conan, many scenes were cut on the editing table because of graphic violence. This 2011 version doesn't suffer that fate. Here the savagery is naked and startling. But the Arnold version was true to the sword and sorcery genre. This 2011 remake is more mainstream and seeks more \\"realistic\\" depiction of ancient warfare, chaos and belief systems. I like both. I can't pick one over the other. Both as they stand alone are beautifully made and well directed. The 2011 version is in epic proportions, a lot more money having been spent on making this one. The cinematography and lighting is very complimentary to the storyline as it progresses.<br /><br />Jason Momoa is a great find. I haven't seen any other movies of his. I would like to. I hope his career isn't affected by the boxoffice results of this Conan adventure. He has great potential as an action hero in any type of movie, period or modern. His talent shines here and carries the movie on his broad scarred shoulders as he rampages against an evil warlord. He is one good reason to go watch this movie. The other is the costumes. It is not overdone like in Gladiator or The Lord of the Rings. Here the costume doesn't steal the limelight and attention from the actors playing their vicious roles. In Conan 2011, the costumes blend in and become an essential accessory of the storyline. We don't get distracted. It just makes everything more real.<br /><br />The franchise has a real chance of surviving. It needs better brand management among other things. Such as a whole new storyline, updating the ancient Robert E. Howard texts by making it more attractive to modern day sword-sorcery-fantasy fans. This would mean a real reboot of the series. There is so much that can be done. I hope a serious director takes up this project in the near future and rebuilds it as it deserves to.<br /><br />The sets and location of Conan 2011 is spectacular. It overshadows any compliment you could give to the 1982 movie. The climax especially is in epic proportions and righly so. Lot of good work has gone into this movie and this is apparent as it progresses through the second half.<br /><br />Among other memorable characters, there is a real talent in the actress playing the evil daughter-witch - Rose McGowan. She exudes evil and she lives it in the role of Marique. Stunning! The other villains also steal the show. They are more memorable than say Conan's allies such as his pirate-friend or the master-thief. Stephen Lang does justice to his role as a warlord. He is not overtly evil. He is patient and wise and calculating. Well portrayed to bring a worthy adversary to Conan. And of course there is the incredibly recognisable and impressive narrative voice of Morgan Freeman retelling the legend of Conan.<br /><br />Actually, the movie needed better marketing effort. I now wish I had seen this on the big silver screen in 3D as it was meant to be. Never mind! Watch it, you won't be disappointed - it is a entertainer and awe-inspiring effort too. I am giving this 5 stars. The Oscar winners don't know what fun they are missing!<br /><br />Those who are complaining about this movie saying it is a travesty or saying that they liked the 1982 film but this one is horrible - you know, these are the same people who would have given bad reviews to the 1982 film if we were living in 1982. But now, they call that a great movie and call this poor. LOL.
B000LB7G00|5.0|It works great although you need a bit of time to get used to it. At first you would move in more than one direction because you're not used to it and don't know what amount of pressure to apply. Navigating is much easier than using the scroll/3 button mouse.<br /><br />I bought it to use it on Sketchup 8 and after browsing the other compatible software I found out about Blender an open source CG modeler. The only drawback is that you can only install it in one computer, which is weird for an accessory. And also it is not compatible with older versions of Photoshop.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|never thought I would enjoy this but I really do. wake up checking my food to make sure it didn't go bad.

0156027321|5.0|This was a great book.  The only problem I had with it is that there was a second ending.  It was not needed in my opinion.  Otherwise, this book is a must read.

B005UDD1R6|2.0|Agree with another reviewer about aspect ratios. Even videos which have a narrower ratio than the screen are distorted, regardless of the stretch setting.<br /><br />Also, when opening a hid from another app, avis doesn't return to the calling app when you press the back button.<br /><br />This app is unusable for me.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|I want to play the DVD, but it does not play on my equipment, perhaps due .......... to a different encoding or something...........would love to see Jon singing Prince Rupert awakes
0439023521|5.0|I had honestly never heard of the Hunger Games until I saw the trailer for the movie, and that alone made me want to read it! I'm so glad I did, the book is a great read from start to finish, I couldn't put it down!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I couldn't stand Before Sunrise. The first time I saw Before Sunset I didn't like it b/c of the ending but I must have fealt or noticed something b/c about 6 months later I watched it again and loved it. I now also like Before Sunrise b/c of the contrast between the characters. They're older and more mature compared to impulsive and dreamy in Before Sunrise
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, It is very suspenseful where Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman keep you on the edge of your seat and very confused. Great supporting roles also
0553582038|4.0|Well, it was hard to get into. There were a lot of new point of views and it was confusing at first. About half way through though it really picks up and the Cersei and Jaime chapters were the most interesting.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|A neat idea, cleverly executed, and suitable for all ages. I love the facial expressions on the blocks as they hurtle off into space. I do wish there was a hint button, and more block types could add some richness, but as is it is outstanding.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|[[ASIN:B004P8JPS6 The Affair: A Reacher Novel (Jack Reacher)]]<br /><br />If you like Lee Child's JACK REACHER novels you will thoroughly enjoy this one.  Couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B007BLCGNU|2.0|Just terrible terrible story-telling. Nothing dramatic. No suspension. No greater-than-itself meaning. Just a plain old tear-jerker, following the templates of 1950's Classic. Don't know who should be called out for this, the screen writer or the director? But it is just such a lame movie.
B004132HZS|5.0|I absolutely love this TV show! It adds a new freshness to the old stories of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Any fan of the books should love this 21st-Century adaption.<br />The acting is flawless- Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman, Rupert Graves, Mark Gatiss.....they play it perfectly! Highly, highly reccomend it, especially to Sherlock Holmes fans.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is among his best albums. The album is closer to \\"Nebraska\\" or \\"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\\" than say \\"Born In The USA\\" or \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\". The first single \\"We Take Of Our Own\\", \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\" and \\"Wrecking Ball\\" are actually the closest to the classic E Street sound. Elsewhere the album takes on a folky-Irish-almost country feel. For me the album is one of those that ends and you start from the beginning again. A few stand out tracks, \\"Shackled And Drawn\\" (with it's Irish pub feel), the very simple piano ballad \\"Jack Of All Trades\\" (one of my favorites from the album), the Irish funeral march \\"Death To My Hometown\\", the gospel/with a rap \\"Rocky Ground\\" and finally \\"We Are Alive\\" with it's \\"Ring Of Fire\\" trumpets. If you get the deluxe edition you get two more tracks, the plantive \\"Swallowed Up (In The Belly Of A Whale) and \\"American Land\\" which to me sort of sounds like a rocked re-write of Johnny Horton's \\"Sink The Bismarc\\" if done by The Dropkick Murpheys.<br /> Throughout the album Springsteen continues singing about the everyday Joe and his struggles to get by. The album is heavily influenced by Pete Seeger and Ireland. If you're a long time Springsteen fan you won't be disappointed, if you're looking for another \\"Dancing In The Dark\\", you won't find that here. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" will certainly be on several \\"Best Albums of 2012\\" lists.

0385534639|5.0|A circus unexpectedly appears in town. It is open only after dusk and closes before dawn. The circus tents are merely black and white. Gone are the brilliant colors of an ordinary circus. This is no ordinary circus. This circus is based on magic, where the reality does not merely seem to be defied, but it IS defied. This circus has a hidden purpose. It is a contractual, compulsory, and deadly competition between two students of magic. The displays of magic become more and more remarkable as the circus travels from town to town around the world. But how does one end the contest? Does the circus have to end with it?<br /><br />Written in a style very reminiscent of Susanna Clark's Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, it is otherworldly subject matter, written in such a convincing way, that the far-fetched seems very possible.<br /><br />The acts and the tents in the night circus are incredibly imaginative. Bursting with unforgettable imagery and realistic, doomed characters, this book is utterly remarkable and memorable. Its very personal style of narration directed toward the reader, draws the reader in as a full participant. It is an adventure, a love story, and a bit of dreams all wrapped up in one!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is very entertaining. But I don't like the whole point system that it has. Despite. that is a very fun game and was designed well.
B000FC1336|5.0|If you enjoy Clancy and Dale Brown, you will enjoy this book. It is something that could happen in real life.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game, it is challenging but keeps you busy it is so addictive. the best part is you don't need wifi!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I like this tv show it was one of the best shows that i used to watch on tv growing up back in the 70s real good dvd hope to see the rest of the show release on dvd soon
B000PDYVVG|2.0|My creative writing teacher showed us a clip of the author speaking.  I fell in love with her immediately, and I really wanted to read this book.  However, the book was very disappointing.  Pretty much the whole thing is about her whining about how miserable her life is and being completely selfish with her friends, monopolizing their time to talk about her problems.  She didn't seem to gain a single scrap of wisdom from her entire year of travel, which was the whole point.  There were a few good lines and ideas, but most of those came from other people, not from the author.  I hoped for a lot more out of this book.
0545425115|5.0|One of the most captivating books I have ever read.  The world that is created has so much depth and fascination, it was hard to do anything else until I got to the end.  Then, I couldn't wait to read the second one.  Can't wait for the movie!
B0055SWM08|5.0|challenging and doesn't get boring like other games. you wonder how to solve but then it comes to you. very unique in all the levels who thinks this stuff up?
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I recently down loaded The Hunger Games to my Kindle from Amazon. I actually bought the trilogy. I have since read the first book and having no idea what it was about, was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't put it down and finished it in 24 hours. I am waiting for just the right time to start the second book of the trilogy as I want to be able to read it uninterrupted.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|As solid as the original a with few new twists! Always addictive game play. Music isn't my taste, but still well done.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Extremely fun. Incredibly addicting. A great challenge. It will definitely make you think outside of the box. I highly recommend.
B000024D4R|5.0|An excellent masterpiece which is typical of Pink Floyd. This is great traveling music. Put in the CD and head away. Good for the soul. I have purchased three of these albums over the years. Animals is clearly a masterpiece with instrumentals and lyrics that go deep into the mind and body.
0786958731|2.0|I haven't played D&D since the 80's. Now that I'm older, I'm looking forward to some game nights with family and friends and this seemed like a perfect choice.<br /><br />I am writing this review immiediately after trying the solo adventure, I wanted to be familiar with it before trying it with others.<br /><br />After getting everything ready, the gameplay seemed to devolve into me moving my Drizzt character to the edge of a tile. After that, a new tile was placed, with a monster. Monster attacks Drizzt, maybe does a little damage. Drizzt attacks and kills monster. Recieve treasure card, which has no picture or any visual exitement to it. Repeat. Come to end of game.<br /><br />I don't really like the low hit points everything seems to have. There is a confusing typo on page 5 of the manual. By the time I got to the \\"end\\" tile, I didn't bother to finish. I was bored and realized I would just kill another monster with the roll of the dice and collect my last meaningless treasure.<br /><br />The figures are pretty descent, though. I am hoping that playing with a group will be more rewarding (not sure how though)
B0044E9LW6|5.0|I'm not generally a big fan of live recordings.  In fact, other than MAIDEN's \\"Live After Death\\" and PRIEST's \\"Unleashed In the East\\", I don't own much live music.  I've always liked DIO, however, and thought this might be something worth trying out as I was a freshman in high school when \\"Holy Diver\\" was released...<br /><br />These sets are AMAZING!!!  Classic, full of energy and a super mix of songs from BLACK SABBATH, RAINBOW and his own stuff, these shows must have been perfect!  DIO was a legend, is still, and will forever be one to all true heavy metal fans.  This 2CD-set belongs in everyone's collection, on their ipods, or on their computers.  It's that good!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|a little hard to do at first. Not really impressed. But it will do to past time. Glad it was free.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Creative and consistently challenging.  The obstacles are sufficiently random that you do need to consistently be paying attention to gain new accolades.  Well done!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|its just a fun and addictive puzzle game! the first time I played it, I played all the way to level 40 bc I couldn't put it down
B0073LWEXK|2.0|On my Kindle Fire and it stuck on Chapter 6.  I am pretty bored with having to use the map and hints, but I decided to finish the game. I guess since the hint about the rope does not work, I am finished.  I don't mind using hints to move the game forward, but there's no logic and no way forward without the hints and map on every step past the first chapter.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This book is very difficult to read.<br />The writing style is \\"traumatic\\" and often confusing.<br />It is incredibly depressing.<br />I've actually been to Pyongyang (I'm a pediatric surgeon), and I believe the author's depiction of that city is accurate.<br />The relentless, dehumanizing, brutality of North Korea is very hard to take.<br />If you read this book, prepare for clinical depression.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Such an amazing story about a disturbing subject. This book opened my eyes to events I had not known much about. A definite must-read.

B00526ZKYS|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games, I was on the hunt for another dystopian story to dig into (glutton for punishment, I know!) when I came across Delirium. I was intrigued by the idea of the book, so I figured I'd give it a shot - and wow, I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />Aesthetics<br />Hardback and Kindle covers for this book leave something to be desired; that being said, the paperback copy of this book will be released in February 2012, and the cover art for this version is beautiful. One of my favorite elements of this story is that Oliver is not just telling you a tale - she's creating an entire world for you. Each chapter begins with an excerpt from \\"educational textbooks\\" and \\"required readings\\" that the society has been built around (and, if you visit the author's website, you can learn even more about this literature). This really makes it feel that this society, while not necessarily real, is at least possible. For me, this added a new and interesting level to the reading experience.<br /><br />Plot<br />This book is relatively long, in YA terms (it's a whopping 480 pages - and, unlike Twilight, NOT printed in super large font), and there's a lot going on. I, for one, devoured this novel the first go around, before I even knew that it was the first of a trilogy. The explanations and details of the everyday life of the characters draw a connection not only to the narrator but to her friends and family. Because of this, I found myself caring not only about the decisions made by the main character but by her supporting cast as well. The romance is sweet without being cheesy, and I loved watching the main character grow as she steadily learned the truth about her life.<br /><br />I will say that I was slightly disappointed when I found out that this was the first of a trilogy and not a stand-alone novel. The story has so much power on its own that when I finished it I was just - in awe. Speechless - which, for me, says a lot (at least when it comes to books!). I truly hope that the other two books are just as wonderful as this one.<br /><br />Overall Readability<br />Wow. WOW. Oliver was born to write. She weaves words together lyrically, as if writing a song that you could listen to over and over again. I love the metaphors and anecdotes that she includes within her prose. I felt like I could highlight the whole book with quotes that I loved.<br /><br />That being said, I have recommended this book to a couple people who just couldn't get into it. The story starts somewhat slowly, and really stays relatively sluggish until the halfway point - some readers will find themselves wishing that they could fast forward past the details and get to the point. I, however, was sold by the first chapter.<br /><br />Recommendation<br />This book ranks up there as one of my favorites. I've read it twice (so far), and I loved it even more the second time. Even though I knew what was coming, the ending still knocked me off my feet and brought tears to my eyes. I hope that you all pick it up and give it a chance - and are as strongly affected as I was.

The book is a first person narrative by a brilliant, thoughtful and careful Pakistani young man about his experiences leaving Princeton, becoming a Wall Street analyst, and living through the a world changed by America's reaction to the events of 9-11.<br /><br />The book is a work of fiction and not an autobiography, but from the author's background, I would guess that some of the protagonist's insights have come from the author's experience.<br /><br />As the book points out, Pakistan is the world's sixth largest country by population, and American interest in Pakistan has waxed and waned depending on other global American interests.  From the protagonist's point of view, the lives of those living in Pakistan have no meaning to Americans except as collateral damage.  As an example of his belief he points out that America failed to intervene to protect Pakistan from Indian aggression as the United States was engaging in the run up to the invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />American papers did report and continue to report about tension between India and Pakistan.  Until reading this book, however, I, blindly, failed to empathize with the ordinary Pakistani who was just as traumatized by the potential of a nuclear exchange with India as were residents of lower Manhattan by the attacks on the Twin Towers.  Moreover, the disruptions to the normal life of people living in Pakistan: officers billeted in homes, freeways being closed to allow the airforce to practice emergency take offs and landings, and gun emplacements near summer homes, may be even greater than the airport lines the average American has had to endure.<br /><br />In this age of globalization, many foreigners come to America and learn how we think.  Their compatriots in their home countries learn only how weact.  This book provides a valuable insights about  how others may perceive us and may help to remove the blinders of our natural national narcissism and give readers an idea how we may be perceived by others, and why.

B005HS00V4|5.0|I had the opportunity of experiencing this concert live when Peter Gabriel came to Argentina. This Bluray was a great way to relive that experience and with better sound quality. I still long for some of the songs that were left back from the concert I attended (Hero from Bowie and Gabriel´s own Secret World) but that is only a sign that this was so good we keep longing for more. I agree with the review I saw on the newspaper after the concert: this is not the first and certainly will not be the last collaboration of a rock artist with a classic orchestra but it will be difficult we will see such a classy, professional, and full of purpose example. It is not a cover´s album but a real reinterpretation of songs where Gabriel really looked for a coherent work and included not only classics but basically songs that made sense with this approach. If it is not clear my message: I certainly recommend it!

B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved this book so much I was prompted to write my first review of a book ever. I was taken on a journey of laughter, tears and learning of what it must be like to have a disability. It was so insightful, I find it amazing that it was written by an able bodied person. Thank you so much for the hours of enjoyment.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|Daniel Espinosa's \\"Safe House\\" is an efficient spy thriller that gives viewers a gratifying number of heart-pounding moments, even though it evaporates from the memory fairly quickly. Denzel Washington plays Tobin Frost, a rogue ex-CIA operative captured in Cape Town and brought in for questioning. Through a series of violent events that is no fair to reveal, Frost ends up in the care of rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), whom Frost openly mocks as a greenhorn. The car chases and shootouts in \\"Safe House\\" are absolutely state-of-the-art, and the screenplay is clever enough to blend the plot exposition in neatly with the action. It's too bad, then, that none of the characters is really memorable, even though the film boasts a glittering cast--not only Washington and Reynolds but also Sam Shepard, Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Robert Patrick and Ruben Blades, all playing characters who may or may not be what they seem. \\"Safe House\\" will give you a good time if you like the espionage thriller genre, but don't expect anything more.

B0009RCPY8|5.0|This includes the classic Ghostbusters dvds with Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2.  I decided to order these after my 5 year old boy went to a Ghosterbusters birthday party and he loves them.  The 2nd one is a little less scary than the first, but they both seem to be fine for a 5 year old boy.  If you like the classic ghosterbusters movies with really corny humor, this is for you.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|John carpenters cult classic \\"The Thing\\" is considered a horror masterpiece, and it is for good reason. Its dark, atmospheric, creepy, scary, and suspense that grabs you by the scruff of your neck and refuses to let go. I guess you could say the Thing gets ahold of you, and you never forget it. Supported by great acting and superb directing, it's easily, if not the best horror film ever made. Period.<br /><br />The 2011 prequel is set several weeks/months before the John carpenter classic begins. It revolves around the Norwegian camp that MacReady and the doctor visit in the beginning of the carpenter film. Where we see the \\"Split-Face\\", the man who slit his throat, and the ice block where the \\"Thing\\" broke out, as well as the camp being burned out and disheveled. The film for the most part, is a great prequel and one of the best I've ever seen. Certainly gives the star wars prequels a run for their money.<br /><br />It has a mix of CGI and practical special effects. On Blu Ray the movie looks great, and way better looking than in theaters. The special effects look more polished and realistic, and the use of practical effects and realistic models blend well with the Carpenter classic.<br /><br />Much like the carpenter film, this movie does a great job of setting up an Eire of mystery around who really had the \\"thing\\" inside them, and who's really human? It's handled fairly well, and does keep things intense and within the tone of the film. However there some continuity issues going into the carpenter film, and some within the 2011 film itself, but they really don't effect the overall film, and can be explained by the \\"Thing\\". But fairly minor overall.<br /><br />The acting is handled very well, and pretty believable. Everyone did a great job, and it never got bogged down into bland uninterested characters, it kept the characters within the situation and seriousness of the subject matter. So overall I was thoroughly surprised by its quality and attention to detail from the Carpenter film, as well as telling its own story. I really suggest giving this movie a try, and if you have John Carpenters \\"The Thing\\" on Blu Ray, this really is a great complement.
1451683405|5.0|Mr. Harris brings an intellectual clarity to complex issues that is simply wonderful.<br /><br />Having slogged through quite a few other books on free will while getting my philosophy degree, I feel I have a solid understanding of what the issues and historical solutions are.<br /><br />Reading this book my simply summary would be - \\"good grief -- why has no one else thought of this ?\\". It is so obviously correct where the 'solutions' of others are not.<br /><br />The reason of course is that now we have science starting to look at the topic, investigating the issue in a way that the armchair pontificator never could.<br /><br />An important work that should be read by anyone with an interest in free will, and all the other folks too.

I have read it at least 4 times since and everytime I learn something I missed before.  Now I give to others.  I highly recommend that everyone should read this at least once.
0763644765|5.0|We just received this book a few days ago, but it's already become one of my daughter's favorites! She's about 21 months old and we are starting to introduce the potty to her. It's a simple book, but really easy to be interactive. You can ask questions, and my daughter answers the questions that are asking in the book. She's even 'read' it by herself a few times.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I got this a while ago as part of the free app a day program but never really used until now. I just got a Toshiba Thrive tablet since even my 3lb laptop was giving me back strain, and was worried I wouldn't be able to take notes properly. This app is fantastic, since it lets me do almost everything I can do on a Windows machine. Powerpoint is a little weird so I'd recommend using it for Word and Excel only. It even links up with Dropbox, which is where I keep all of my classwork. Such a great app!

B006UG90RM|1.0|If you like old VH school, look somewhere else, Mike voice is missing, no one can replace his voice in the current band (the rest besides Dave, are unable to simply sing) and themes are really boring...A total waste of talents...Since 1984, nothing has come out from those guys really worthy!!! With the exception of the Dave solo albums...and not all of them either!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book put a light on the SEALS that needed to be out there. It gives the best description of their training that I've ever read. It shows true brotherhood and teamwork, and the insane courage these guys have.  This is a must-read for anyone who has any sense that our military are not heroes, one and all.  This SEAL Team were all 'ABOVE AND BEYOND'. My heart and prayers go out to all their families for their loss, but know that these guys are true American Patriots. Hero isn't a strong enough word for each of them.
B0015DROBO|5.0|OK,<br /><br />I've stopped giving five star reviews overall because a book has to literally blow my socks off to qualify, and most books just don't do that for me.<br /><br />But this one did.<br /><br />Five Stars to this book. FIVE STARS.<br /><br />ONLY, and after, let me point out, #364 pages of back-story.<br /><br />Then, all of a sudden THIS THING ERUPTS.<br /><br />A current No-No in fiction, but we can't tell Stieg that now, can we?<br /><br />Seriously, someone needs to edit the first third of this book, but, I don't see that ever happening - so, on with what impressed me.<br /><br />Lisbeth and Mikael's relationship.<br /><br />It explodes suddenly after they meet. And so does the action. Larsson is brilliant, the way he wove all the mysteries together. I certainly couldn't have done it all in 644 pages. But he did. He told a story that knocked my socks off - I'm so glad I didn't put it down. He wove current issues of Stock Trading fraud in-amongst a thirty year-old murder mystery with a twist even I didn't see coming, all within a current-day psycho-murderer-sex-offender plot that took my breath away.<br />(I love it when the creeps really get it in the end, don't you?)<br /><br />I'm telling you people, you want to read about Lisbeth Salander and how she navigates her place in the world. She's a heroine with GUTS that I'll be sad to see disappear with the end of this series.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about her unorthodox methods is I have two more novels in the series to discover her actions and motivations in yet-to-read novels I can't wait to get to. I read this book for my local RiverStone Book Club Spring assignment, and I must say, hats off to Peggy for including it on the list.<br /><br />I wrote my novel, Careful What You Wish For... in 2009, before I read this, and now I feel like I'm back in elementary school compared to Stieg Larsson. Seriously, I'm not worthy.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a GoodRead.<br /><br />Paula Millhouse
0061689246|4.0|This book is a great one for quick, fun reading.  Gaiman's style here comes almost as very fairy-tale-esque, and at times this almost reads like a children's story (though Gaiman is quick to remind us that it is not).  The writing in this story is very simple and straight-forward... Gaiman doesn't use a whole lot of flowery language, so this book isn't difficult to read in the slightest (but the plot of the story is enough to keep advanced readers interested as well).<br /><br />It's accessible enough to be enjoyable to teenagers and adults alike.  I wouldn't recommend it for children younger than about 13 because there are brief instances of cursing and some suggestive content (nothing explicit, but still).  But for anyone of teenage years and above it is a delightful and imaginative read.  It was the first book by Neil Gaiman that I've had the pleasure of reading and I definitely look forward to experiencing more of his work.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the first book, the second one is better, but there are SO many characters its hard to keep track of them all! Cant wait for the movie to come out!
B005TBN3EU|5.0|If you are pleased by experiences which affirm your assumptions; Disgust, boredom, and confusion will likely be your experience.  If you realize and perhaps embrace how ones perspective on reality is as accurately expansive as your willingness to be wrong, then this may be the funniest movie you have seen in years. If the intersection of tragedy and serendipity that defines an attentive life is an experience which you prefer over one based on a fearful rigidity, I enthusiastically encourage you to watch this film. Really, I love the movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well, where do I even begin....First of all, this book is basically a BDSM version of Edward & Bella's relationship.  There is so MUCH similar dialogue from the Twilight Saga that it may as well be verbatim which really annoys me.  I think for as much reseach as the author did in BDSM sexuality (unless she practices it), she really could have been much more original in the dialogue as well as the characters.  Christian (aka Edward) has bronze, unkept hair, he's like a Greek God, perfect in every way physically, etc. and Anastasia has long dark hair, (the only difference apart from Bella is that her eyes are blue instead of brown)extremely clumsy, hates dancing,skinny & pale, etc.  It's ridiculous really.  Also, this author is British and it really shows in her writing style and the way she uses dialogue with the characters which I wouldn't care either way about except that they live in Washington State and all other places their families live are in the states.  It's just \\"off.\\"  I am not into BDSM so I cannot relate to this kind of sexual conduct but to each his/her own.  It's very graphic and sexual from start to finish. Also, Ana is a 21 year old virgin and has NO experience even kissing whatsoever. Yes, another one of those.  Really?? Not likely. What I will say is that I was instantly intrigued at seeing their relationship build and the fact that Christian had so many \\"issues\\" that I wanted to know so much more about him and how Ana was going to relate to all that.  It definately had me reading quickly through it because I was dying to know what happened to him, what it was all about, and whether he'd let her help him through it and finally let someone love him.  For those reasons, I couldn't put it down.  Some of the dominant/submissive sex scenes really would piss me off that he would treat her that way because he is so messed up and that she would allow him to.  The things people do for love, I suppose. SPOILER ALERT** I will also say that when they break upat the end, it is devastating because even though Christian is such an inward wreck, you can't help but be pulling for him & YES, I have already purchased the 2nd book because I had to know if they work it out and what happens.  These books aren't for the faint of heart that's for sure. LOL! I wish the characters had much more originality in the descriptive department & that there wasn't so much Twilight ripped off but I am sure I will probably finish this trilogy because the characters and the story are so intriguing.  I will likely review book 2 as well.
B004EWFV9K|3.0|I have loved all of the other Wallander books, and knew that reading this one would be bittersweet. I'm really curious why Henning Mankell wrote it after a span of years from his previous book. It does resolve the fate of Kurt Wallander in a very depressing, but not completely inappropriate way, but the focus of the book- a spy story- is so unlike the other Ystad books to be really alien. I enjoyed the other books because of the insights into human, and especially Swedish, nature. Other writers can do espionage tales much better. I hope the author considers another Wallander book, which would take place chronologocally before this one, but which would be a better complement to the entire series. I still think Mankell is a wonderful writer, but it is a shame to see the series end on this note.

0061969656|5.0|Cornwell's Viking age series is mind candy for me.  Since reading the first of the series, I have consumed each additional one like a glutton.  The hero is an unapreciated warrior who mostly speaks his mind, loves the wrong women, and fights for a cause that he would rather avoid, to keep his word.  I'd like to think that for the most part, I've followed that pattern myself, so it really struck a cord with me.<br /><br />For maybe  3 or 4 years,  I had  a bookclub copy Bernard Cornwell novel in my book case.  One day a year ago, I picked it up and read it.  Almost cover to cover  I consumed it, in  one long,  single session. Now I have read, and given a number of his books away as gifts.  By now, I've read most every book that I can find, that he has written.<br /><br />Enjoy it for yourself.
0316067598|5.0|Excellent book. Heartfelt and filled with an accurate account of the war and media feelings surrounding it. Best SEAL book I have read and also one of the best books I havce read in recent memory.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Where many have tried, Paul McCartney sings the old standards as never heard before. This CD is a must have for all McCartney fans and fans of the old standards. I give this CD a \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\"!!
B000001ZSE|1.0|This one is a weird edition, album backcover says it's 1991 17-track issue, but CD itself contains 1997 20-track remastered version. I was completely disappointed by this considering I was searching for old 17-track edition. I wouldn't recommend to buy this edition. Images is a great compilation, and if you want it, get \\"true\\" 17-track or 20-track issue.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books must have been named \\"The Hunger Games\\" because you don't even want to stop to eat while engrossed in the trilogy !<br />Just received photos of granddaughters on a roof terrace in Fes, Morrocco on holiday and there was the sixteen year old sitting off by herself with her head bent over the book.  In our case it covers ages 16 to 72 and it entertained us both.  Something for everyone.<br />Now, back to Amazon for more good reading.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This was one part of the Kindle Fire gift I gave.  The Cover works just like it shows and it gives some extra protection to the Kindle. I would reccommend it for all the Kindles.

B002M3GPOI|5.0|King Crimson's deluxe, multidisc \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" and 5.1 surround is the perfect match. Because of the way the album was recorded -- very open sonic spaces to begin with, plus a rather stately tempo throughout -- it invites sitting in the midst of one's speaker array on a rainy day, simply absorbing..<br /><br />The title track benefits most from the remix, with some excellent decisions having been made regarding the false ending. I don't want to say more for fear of spoiling.<br /><br />Other elements of this big package: Declicked original album mix, alternate takes; the usual stuff, really. But King Crimson never would record another album quite like this -- for the most part, ITCOTKC is airy, atmospheric, pensive. Yes, elements of future KC albums would sound like this, but they dominate here.<br /><br />As recording of this album was concluded and a brief tour undertaken, Crimson would suffer the first of many crushing breakup/personnel changes, but somehow would carry on. Hear this for a sonic snapshot of what they were near their very beginning.

B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Well after Working on a Dream, I figured Bruce was running out of steam. That album had a few good tracks but was not a favorite in my book. Now this album just listening to it turned up you can tell he is awake and alert and ready to rock n roll. Out of the 13 tracks (including 2 special bonus tracks) I only dislike one. Now thats getting your moneys worth. 12 out of 13 is a win everytime. Here is the break down-<br /><br />\\"We Take Care of Our Own\\"-Instant classic song, reminds me of Born In The Usa. Very powerful and tho strong lyrics still light hearted and fun to listen to. Liked right from the first listen. Hence the single was picked.<br /><br />\\"Easy Money\\"-had to listen to a few times to like, at first didnt care for it but it runs well with the next few tracks. And like some movies/songs after a few listens I rather like it and look forward to hearing it.<br /><br />\\"Shackled and Drawn\\"-like easy money only I liked this song a little more, nice strong voice from Bruce. Listen to them loud and take them in.<br /><br />\\"Jack of All Trades\\"-good lyrics, slow song. Good to hear tho, reminds me of what hope is. And no matter what we will make it through.<br /><br />\\"Death to My Hometown\\"-this song I dont like, I have tried and its not the singing or the lyrics, its the damn irish tone or whatever he has on there. Reminds me of bag pipes or some crap. Dont like it no matter how many times I listen to it. Never will.<br /><br />\\"This Depression\\"-great slow track. Anyone that has lost someone/something they love can feel it. Beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\"-another instant classic, liked from the first listen. a little less aggressive than the track released by itself. Which is good and bad, I like them both.<br /><br />\\"You've Got It\\"-nice love song, one you can write down the lyrics to your wife/gf. nice groove to it as well. instant classic.<br /><br />\\"Rocky Ground\\"-song that will stick in your head, nice song only downside is the rap (yeah, thats right.) its in there....and not like hardcore gangster rap but it still rap. I hate....and I mean I HATE rap so I didnt like him adding that. good thing is its quick and painless. I dont know why he added it but its in there. Still a good track, just 5 seconds of it should have been edited out. no one is perfect.<br /><br />\\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\"-my favorite track on the cd, if you need any reason to pick up the cd make it this song. I dont have enough room in this review box to write how much I love this song. One of bruces best songs ever. Never released on cd, only live. This is a beautiful track, with beautiful lyrics and heart. One of the best songs written in the past 30 years hands down.<br /><br />\\"We Are Alive\\" \\"Swallowed Up (In the Belly of the Whale)\\" -Both great songs, nothing really to write about, just good sounding music that fits with the album. \\"American Land\\" good song, doesnt sound like springsteen tho....so good but strange to listen to I guess.<br /><br />All in All great cd, pick it up today.ght.) its in there....and not like hardcore gangster rap but it still rap.

B005IZLPME|5.0|What a great movie. I loved the movie settings. I think the movie directors caught the feel of the 30's and 40's
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a really good app. Although, it does leave out parts of verses. This app is good for reading on the go but it requires an Internet connection in order to highlight verses and create notes. There are lots of permissions in order to create your account but an all around good app.

6304712936|4.0|My favorite movie, had it, this was a replacement because the \\"borrowers\\" must have taken the original. If you like Mozart, you'll love this film. It really showcases his many opera's and other musical pieces. F. Murray Abraham is FANTASTIC as Salieri, Mozarts rival in the music world. Tom Hulce as Mozart is outrageous. A music lovers movie
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I loved the idea of the app working with Google Tasks, but sadly, it isn't quite as harmonious as one would like.  I do appreciate the different views of looking at the lists (individually, with all tasks combined, sorted by due date, etc.) but would be happier with a more Google Task-oriented app.

0439023521|5.0|Wow! This was really great! I was hesitant to read it, because of all the hoopla over it, but I finally gave in. I rarely find a \\"cannot put it down\\" book for me, because I am easily distracted. I found myself aggravated with stuff that kept me from reading on!<br /><br />This book is violent and scary, but therein lies its message. The future may hold similar terrors if the powerful become mad with control.<br /><br />I read another review that said basically the plot was flawed, because there is no way society, especially parents, would send their children out to fight and kill each other; that there wasn't enough evidence in the book that the parents have tried to cry foul and stop the Hunger Games. **WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?** Notwithstanding any future horrors, we participate in this every day! Young people from everywhere are sent to war, whether forced or volunteered, parents have not been able to stop it. Is anybody old enough to remember THE DRAFT, back in Vietnam and prior? Parents and sons worked to resist it, at the expense of becoming outlaws. So who thinks something like the Hunger Games could never happen? They are only sending a few, where today we send them all.<br /><br />Anyway, I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. Kudos to Suzanne Collins for a chilling allegory into human nature, politics, and power.
B003PIS5XI|5.0|Okay. I bought The Last Starfighter because it was a blast from my past. It's hard to believe it's the 25th anniversary edition. The film is note-worthy for three things: It was the first sci-fi film to use CGI, it was the great Robert Preston's final theatrical film (wherein he plays his trademark flim-flam man) and the usually urbane Dan O'Herlihy is made up as a lizard. The DVD comes with cool extras, but more importantly, it's a fun film that the whole family can enjoy. I won't give away the plot if you haven't seen it, but if there is a video gamer in your family, they will love this movie.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|This movie was terrible!!  No other way to describe it.  It is stupid and not worth watching.  I can only recall 2 scenes in the movie where there is some driving, there could be more but obviously they were not very memorable.  This is a crap movie.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|YouVersion of the Bible is quite nice.  It has several plans for reading the Bible, such as daily for an entire year, or during specific seasons of the Church Year, Advent and Lent, for example.  There is a short devotional reading followed by a Biblical passage to read.  If you want to read more of that day's chapter, you can easily tap on \\"View in Context\\" to continue.  You can also go to any book, chapter and/or verse fairly easily.  I started the year-long daily reading plan and am quite happy with the short passages, short 'sermon-type' devotionals and the check-off system/calendar, so you can go back and catch up or read ahead and yet, you always know what you've completed.<br /><br />My gripe with this App is that for Lent, I started the Lenten Daily Reading Plan, which has a couple of glitches.  One is that the dates are from 2011, beginning on March 9.  It's quite confusing to figure out which day you're supposed to be on, too, since it ALWAYS takes you to Ash Wednesday, even though we're already nearly finished with Week 2.  However, there is a calendar, so you can see what you've finished and just go to the next date, click/tap on it, and you're in.  It's just annoying that I have to do this every single time over 40 + days.  My MAJOR GRIPE is that I contacted the website and told them of the problem with the March 2011 dates, 2-3 weeks before Lent started, and they thanked me, said they would address the problem and, DID NOTHING!  I hate being patronized by webmasters or whoever answers e-mails!<br /><br />I hope they have this fixed by Lent of 2013, and are not just re-running Lent of 2011, yet again.  I also hope that by the time we get to Advent of 2012, this same problem won't crop up.

B003UYV08E|2.0|Overall, this movie missed the mark entirely for me in the story department, despite the incredible visual effects.<br />Unfortunately, I saw Iron Man and I thought it was a great movie. It had a great story, excellent action, fun dialogue, etc.  So it set a pretty high standard for the franchise. Iron Man 2? Was a dud for me.<br />The story follows Tony Stark, about six months after he confessed to being Iron Man (the end of Iron Man, the first movie). And he turns out to be a pretty arrogant cuss, thinking he's all that and a bag of chips. Enter the \\"Bad Russian\\" who is ready to take him on (for some hokey revenge issue about his dad). And of course there's a big final blow-out battle at the end.<br />Obviously, visually, the movie is great. The acting is great. Mickey Rourke did an excellent job.<br />But it gets a little hard to keep track of all the senseless and distracting subplots going on that do nothing really, for the story. The subplots they had going on in Iron Man, seem to have been dumped into the waste basket for the 2nd installment, which is confusing as all.<br />It's a shame really. They poured a ton of money into this movie, and yet all those visual effects and great acting skills, do not a good script and story make.<br />I would not buy this movie for my collection. Though I would buy the first movie.
B0062A5RUA|4.0|This album gave me everything I expected.  It's got a good clear tone (high quality record).  I liked Slash's album and I was interested in hearing what the live act sounded like.  I'm fairly impressed with Myles Kennedy.  This is a live CD worth looking into.
B004TSXUWY|2.0|Another review I spent some time thinking over, because after all the great reviews for this book I was very disappointed. It is a one-dimensional story, and without giving anything away, it was repetitive partly because of the nature of the story but it got to the point where I was screaming for the story to move on and let something happen.<br /><br />When the denouement finally arrived,it was was too long winded and quite condescending to the reader with one major key plot point that was completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Then after all that the last sentence left me completely infuriated.
B004R6JG7Q|2.0|'[[ASIN:6301915445 Red Line 7000]]' and '[[ASIN:B000FFJYCU Grand Prix]]' wannabe.<br /><br />Not happy to ding this flick since I'm a fan of McQueen, but this static monstrosity can only be liked by hardcore F1 aficionados.<br /><br />What truly stunned me was it was nearly 40 minutes before I even knew who was who - I mean the filmmakers don't even identify characters or explain their relationships to one another. Plus, I honestly could *not* believe that you had to listen to the public address announcer, who was in essence, laying out the story. Probably one the most idiotic things I have ever experienced in film.<br /><br />Worse yet, that critical information so vitally important in understanding the plot, is played in the background, jumbled in and amongst the other ambient audio tracks.<br /><br />Stunning. In the same way that most of MTV's moronic reality programming could be considered 'amazing'.<br /><br />I will say that the final ten minutes of the movie was exciting, if viewed from a somewhat coldly distant perspective, given the lack of our involvement in either the characters or superficial screenplay.<br /><br />Likely McQueen's weakest production where he was the lead actor.

However, what makes this series so intriguing is the intense love story between the tortured hero Christian and his Ana.  Read the series immediately.  You will be enthralled in the first 5 pages..I promise.

B004TF3HZ2|5.0|An impressive live document showcasing most of the material (6 out of the 8 tracks) from OUT OF THE TUNNEL'S MOUTH by Hackett and his crack band. My personal feeling is OotTM was his finest release in 30 years so hearing it essentially performed live within months of its release is fine by me. Given Hackett's lengthy body of work one gets a clear indication of what his most meaningful/influential periods from the past are; If I'm not reading too much into it, that would be mid-'70s Genesis and SPECTRAL MORNINGS('79) and DEFECTOR('80) from his vast solo canon. LIVE RAILS includes five Genesis cuts from 1973-76 as well as five more from those two solo albums. Here is a premier guitarist redefining (perhaps even rediscovering) what it means to be in one's prime, backed by an extremely talented group, many of whom have honed their skills with Hackett for a few years. Nick Beggs (Iona) seems to have settled in as this band's bassist with his hard-driving and intricate playing. Drummer Gary O'Toole also handles vocals on the Genesis tracks (sound familiar?) \\"Blood on the Rooftops,\\" \\"Firth of Fifth\\" and \\"Broadway Melody\\" but fully distinguishing himself from either of that band's two lead singers. Keyboardist Roger King continues his role as Steve Hackett's right hand man.<br /><br />Steve Hackett is not resting on his laurels. He is continually exploring new sounds and expanding his comfort level. Given the resounding success of the follow-up BEYOND THE SHROUDED HORIZON, I submit, an artist on the upswing.<br /><br />Hackett fans already know what he's all about. However, if you're generally a rock music fan but somehow unfamiliar with this man please get LIVE RAILS and OUT OF THE TUNNEL'S MOUTH and BEYOND THE SHROUDED HORIZON and just concentrate on the songs, the guitar playing. There's a good chance you'll be amazed.<br /><br />...Or if you've turned 60 and think there's nowhere to go but downhill, perhaps this will serve as inspiration to forge ahead with strength andconfidence.

B005FITILO|5.0|Young Adult (2011)<br />Comedy, Drama, 94 minutes<br />Directed by Jason Reitman<br />Starring Charlize Theron, Patton Oswalt and Patrick Wilson<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 4.5/5<br /><br />Jason Reitman's first full-length feature was Thank You for Smoking and he followed it with Juno and Up in the Air. All three films are among my favorites and I was eager to see Young Adult in theaters. I consider Juno and Up in the Air to be just about perfect, so expectations were sky high.<br /><br />Diablo Cody won the Oscar for her Juno screenplay, but Young Adult is very different in tone. Juno MacGuff was extremely likable, but Mavis Gary (Theron) is anything but. She's selfish and doesn't consider anyone worthy of her time. She barely functions as an adult and is in all likelihood an alcoholic. The title refers to the fiction she writes for the teen market, but her series has run its course and she's writing the final installment.<br /><br />When she receives an email showing that her ex-boyfriend, Buddy (Wilson), is married and has recently become a father, all she can think about is going to her old home town to win him back. The fact that he is happily married is a minor convenience. After all, she has baggage too.<br /><br />Mavis makes the trip back to Mercury, Minnesota and calls Buddy. They arrange to meet the following evening so she visits a bar on her own the first night she's in town. It's there that she runs into Matt Freehauf (Oswalt), who had the locker next to her in high school. He was the victim of a hate crime in school because a group of thugs thought he was gay. It turns out that he wasn't, but it's left him unable to walk without using a crutch.<br /><br />Matt becomes an outlet for Mavis and he's used as a device to show the audience how deranged Mavis really is. She's not shy about announcing her intentions to wreck Buddy's marriage and steal him away. Matt casually informs her that she's mentally ill. The two form a kind of friendship which is aided by Matt's ability to brew alcohol and her need to talk about Buddy and stay permanently drunk.<br /><br />As you can tell, Young Adult isn't a typical comedy. Most romantic comedy has a likable woman pursuing a man, with the two ending up together and living happily ever after. This film is more of a character study than a traditional comedy. You'll laugh at Mavis because she's so outrageous and completely clueless about the negative impact she has on other people. You'll never really root for her, but something makes you want to see what she is going to do next.<br /><br />There is some small ray of hope for Mavis at the end of the film. She may not achieve what she sets out to do, but she does have an epiphany about her depressing existence. As usual, Reitman and Cody come up with a few surprises. Whatever you think of Mavis, you'll probably agree that the film is well-made and intelligently written. Some of the observations are funny, while others are sad, but they all fit the characters and feel authentic.<br /><br />Theron does a good job of appearing unlikable. We even see how Mavis transforms herself from a virtual zombie who can barely function into a woman attractive enough to get Buddy's attention. Mavis might not be a woman that you will like or recognize, but she's never boring. Oswalt's portrayal of Matt is vital and the film wouldn't work without it. He's funny, but his acting ability also gives him a convincing vulnerability. He's very honest about his flaws and he's a character that is easy to like.<br /><br />On first viewing, I gave Young Adult 4/5. After two further viewings, I'll raise that to 4.5/5. It doesn't have Ellen Page or George Clooney to help place it among my absolute favorite films, but I'm very happy to own it.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is very good. Detail is strong and I didn't detect any weak points. The audio does exactly what it is supposed to, but the film is driven by dialogue and you won't be blown away by the sound. if you liked the film in theaters, the Blu-ray is worth picking up. With an audio commentary and more than an hour of special features, it's a good overall package.ve Ellen Page or George Clooney to help place it among my absolute favorite films, but I'm very happy to own it.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is very good.

B004UXUX7S|5.0|The Descendants (2011)<br />Comedy, Drama, 115 minutes<br />Directed by Alexander Payne<br />Starring George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Nick Krause and Amara Miller<br /><br />***Spoilers within***<br /><br />It took me about two minutes to decide that The Descendants was going to be my kind of film. It happened during Clooney's opening voice-over in which he observed that, just because they live in paradise, Hawaiians aren't exempt from the usual problems people face. That statement caught my attention because it's true, but it also alerted me to the possibility that the script would be both truthful and more intelligent than most.<br /><br />Matt King (Clooney) is the kind of character that I can identify with. He's a lawyer and his job is more important to him than his family. He regularly travels to neighboring islands on business and hasn't had a proper relationship with his wife and two daughters for several years. When his wife has an accident which places her in a coma, Matt's life changes instantly. He has to be a father to his daughters and he's completely unprepared.<br /><br />His younger daughter, Scottie (Miller), is 10 years old. Matt last took care of her when she was three. His other daughter, Alex (Woodley), is 17 and is in a boarding school to help her overcome alcohol and drug problems. When Matt learns that his wife will never wake up, he takes Scottie to collect Alex from the school. Alex is drunk when he turns up and openly defies him early in the film.<br /><br />Place yourself in Matt's situation for a moment. How would you attempt to console your daughters? What would help you establish some kind of connection with them? If you're all they have left, how will you make them feel as if everything is going to be all right?<br /><br />Matt isn't happy with Alex because she argued with her mother the last time they spoke, but her reasoning is sound; she found out that her mother was cheating on Matt. Alex insists that her boyfriend, Sid (Krause), stays with her while she is home. Sid appears to be fairly dumb and occasionally stoned. Matt is not happy.<br /><br />The story really takes off when Matt takes Sid and his daughters to a neighboring island in search of his wife's lover. Another story thread explains that Matt and his many cousins are descended from Hawaiian royalty and own a piece of land worth around $500 million. Matt is the sole trustee and must organize the group of cousins and decide who to sell the land to. A complication emerges later in the story which could have a major impact on his decision, but I won't reveal any more of the film's secrets.<br /><br />I've watched Clooney develop as an actor over the past few years. He used to be criticized for \\"always being Clooney\\", but I think he's proved that there's a lot more to him. His timing is excellent and he always delivers his comedic lines well, but he has to show considerable range as Matt. Many of the scenes require him to show his feelings without the use of words. He goes through a lot of emotions during the film and pulls it off perfectly whether the situations are positive or negative. His performance is human, real, touching, emotional and understandable. I thought he should have won the Oscar for his performance in Up in the Air, but this latest oversight is a glaring error.<br /><br />What I really liked about the film was the character development. We see Matt grow as expected, but I was stunned by the development shown in Alex and Sid. They both have more to them than meets the eye and I ended up liking both characters tremendously.<br /><br />The conclusions that Matt reaches by the end of the story seem plausible and fit well with his development as a father and as a responsible adult. I might have reached the same conclusions if I were placed in his shoes.<br /><br />You'll definitely laugh during The Descendants and you may even be moved to tears.<br /><br />Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash won the Oscar for theiradaptation of Kaui Hart Hemmings' book and it was thoroughly deserved. It's rare to witness a film with such intelligent writing. The characters and situations are always believable. If you were in their position, you might find yourself behaving in the same way.<br /><br />The Descendants is my favorite film of 2011 and, in a few years, I suspect many will wonder why it didn't win for Best Picture when we find out whether The Artist has lasting appeal.adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemmings' book and it was thoroughly deserved.

B0006ZE7G2|2.0|I am a huge Pink Floyd fan but I have to admit, this movie lost something since I was a kid, although I suspect I'm just getting old:(  Very strange movie, hard to follow, but great music & I must admit, Bob Geldolf did a great job as Pink.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|This movie is primarily about the importance of a father in the life of a child.  That is not all it is about though.  It also showed me that I can't hold on to the wrongs that others have done to me.  I can't use what others have done as an excuse to waist my life.
B003LSTK8G|3.0|As a transplanted European I found the observations fascinating.  However as a weekly reader of 'The Economist' I didn't find much surprising nor enlightening.  There are other books with much more information, such as Morgenson & Rosner's 'Reckless Endangerment' which gives lots of information on how our leaders have failed us, from Alan Greenspan, to the bodies of the Senate, House of Representatives, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve, to mention just a few.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|this is a fun simple game. good for kids and bored adults. I just got to level 30. surely addicting
B005GET42K|5.0|The author starts by saying he was invited to teach a class on TRANSLATION.  But he asked the interviewer, Define translation, which the latter could not.  This book is the result.  Such questions as, what is an exact translation, what is a good translation, is a translation ever as good as or better than the work in the original language, and how does a written translation differ from an immediate translation as in the UN Security Council.  If you are interested in languages and linguistics you may find this book hard to lay down.  I recommended it to a close friend who is 87 years old; he found it the best book he' read in a couple of years.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|The 3rd season just keeps getting better and better...not that this show needed improvement!  I love that no thread is left untied and that each of the main characters is made so human.  This is one TV series that we'll watch over and over again.

006197806X|4.0|pandemonium is set six months after the first book in this trilogy, Delirium.  In a brief recap, Lena was due to receive her procedure that eliminates deleria (feelings of love).  Living in a controlled Dystopian society, the government believes that deleria (love) is just messy and people are better off with out it  When Lena meets Alex, a boy her own age who had managed to avoid having the procedure done, Lena starts to have second thoughts and a plan is made to escape with Alex.<br /><br />Now, six months later, pandemonium opens with Lena having survived (barely) to make it to the Wild's where a small community has formed of those who have not had \\"the cure\\".  Outcasts, Intruders as they are called.  Lena now has to learn to live in a very different manner and it is going to take all her strength and determination to make a go at this new type of life.<br /><br />Thrown back and forth between this new world, and the one she came from Lena feels she is living a double life.... which however holds the real Lena's heart?<br /><br />Ahhh.... pandemonium how I have waited for you!  It has been almost a year since I had plunged head first into Delirium which left me with a huge cliffhanger that I wanted to know what would happen next!  Pandemonium did not disappoint, taking off right from where Delirium left off I learned quickly that author Lauren Oliver has no problem making the hard choices when it comes to what characters will carry on.  Shocked at first (but pleasantly so) by the direction that the book went... I found the more I read I read, the harder it was to put down.<br /><br />Written in clever alternating chapters of then and now, you read this book in two different times, Lena's time in the Wild's from day one, and then an alternate later time where Lena.... well, you will just have to read that yourself.  :D<br /><br />Highly enjoyable and oh snap if it does not leave me with my mouth hanging open and a smack to the head.... now I have to wait for that third book!third book!
1612130283|1.0|I purchased this as an ebook after hearing it was getting rave reviews. After just the first paragraph, I began to regret my decision. I continued reading in the hopes the reason it has been setting readers afire would become apparent. I finally gave up that hope when I got to the deflowering. This reads like the Harlequin novels I read as a teenager, except with a BDSM twist. My literary tastes have matured since then. The characters are wholly unbelievable, the dialogue is unnatural, and the one sex scene I read was blah. I want my money back.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is a game with challenge that you can still play in bite-sized pieces. It's fun, tricky, and keeps me interested board after board.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We have really enjoyed this series and can't wait until season 3!<br />It was great to be able to watch it again and again!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|This was a good, solid adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs source material. The film manages to capture the essence of the character and create a decent traditional adventure story. Everything is simple and straightforward driving the plot along. It would not be exceptional but for the fact that so many other film makers would not be capable of doing it. The film is exceptionally well paced aside from the beginning which takes forever to get going.<br /><br />Some changes were made to the source material. Mostly useless and unnecessary changes in my opinion that are each somewhat associated with modern obsessions:<br /><br />(minor spoilers follow)<br /><br />- Carter is given baggage and angst based on his civil war service. This wasn't necessary and thankfully the film minimizes it.<br /><br />- Rather than the ambiguity about how he got to mars that features in the books, we are offered in the film a definitive pseudo-scientific \\"alien technology\\" reason. I liked the original non-explaination of the book better but obviously people today would think that getting to mars through a cave is \\"silly\\" while talking about alien technology is the ultimate in scientific seriousness.<br /><br />- The conflict with the apaches is unnecessarly politically correct. It would have been enough to simply have the US Cavalry at war with the apache and use their attempts to draft carter to make him \\"man in the middle\\" in the conflict. But instead we are given apache pacifists who only start fighting after the army shoots at them.<br /><br />- One of the more silly elements is making Dejah Thoris into a scientist who is going to save mars through technology. First, at the heart of the original concept is that mars can only make progress when its peoples start working together. Making science the savior is against the basic concept. Second, its unnecessary baggage for the character. Someone obviously read the books, thought she wasn't a serious enough character and launched into overcompensation to \\"fix\\" it. It extends to the point of calling her \\"professor\\". There were ways to freshen up the character short of the blunt and overly obvious ways they decided to go about doing it.<br /><br />- The worst change is to the Therns. The Therns are changed from the useless reminants of the proud technological past of Mars into all-purpose world destroying alien villians. This was no doubt added because people who see films today want easily identifiable archtype villians. Making the Therns responsible for everything on Mars undercuts one of the basic themes of the book which was the fall of a civilization through a natural disaster and that bringing the people of Mars together was the only way to make things better. The message of the book has a certain amount of relivance to modern politics today. But of course the idea that there is an easily identifiable villian responsible for all problems is even more relivant to the paranoid world of 2012.<br /><br />The Therns should have been presented, in my opinion, as a disinterested small elite on the planet with technology, obsessed with intellectual and religious debate among themselves and no longer interested in the fate of anyone else.<br /><br />The idea of the Therns as manipulators wasn't a bad one. But they could have gone in a better direction with it. Having the Therns, for example, manipulating and pushing an agenda that they considered as improving mars as a whole but without regard to the consequences to individuals such as Dejah Thoris.<br /><br />If they do more films, they should keep the action strictly on Mars. Nobody wants \\"tarzan in new york\\" with Dejah Thoris playing Tarzan.<br /><br />Despite the lengthy comments, I liked the film and I like the fact that they given a blueprint for how to do an adventure film that others will hopefully take up.
B002VECLVY|5.0|\\"A Single Man\\" is one of the best pieces of dramatic art I've ever seen on the silver screen.  Major kudos to director Tom Ford for bringing out the hauntingly poetic and deeply emotional scenes that are peppered throughout this film.<br /><br />Simply put, the overarching plot theme is one of lament over the loss of a loved one and how one copes with that loss.  During the lamenting and grieving process, the individual (George Falconer, portrayed by Colin Firth) comes across experiences that not only pose a challenge to his own grieving process, but also give him reason to continue living life to its fullest.  Evident in this film are discussions of extremely philosophical issues such as life and death, fear, friendship, intimacy (both male-female AND male-male), and love.<br /><br />I've watched \\"A Single Man\\" twice so far, and the second time was better than first.  There are scenes in this film where George has these intense discussions with a few of the characters, and you're left on the edge of your seat with that feeling of \\"will he do it?  will he?!  what's going through their minds?!\\"  It's just GREAT.  The element of dramatic pause is also used extensively in this film, and it really hits the mark with increased on-screen tension.  As for Colin Firth, THIS was the role that he should have won the Best Actor Academy Award for, not King George in \\"The King's Speech\\"!  The scene where he receives the phone call that his lover died was enough to literally hand him that Oscar.  Thankfully, he did get his rightfully deserved Academy Award, but I think it came a little late for him.  Also, this film was snubbed from the Best Picture category, and I think it should have received a nomination at the very least.  I know for a fact that I'll be watching this movie many times over the course of my life...it's just that amazing!<br /><br />FIVE STARS
B003629IPW|5.0|Absolutely, beautifully done.  Fortunately \\"This Is It\\" DVD captures the essence & passion of Michael Jackson, performers, producers preparing for tour.  It is difficult not to be emotional in my review about how I am left after seeing this DVD and what MJ was creating.<br /><br />After seeing this documentary the appreciation I feel for having been here while he was on this planet, now grows daily.  I was moved and inspired by what he created around himself and for others.  Wow.  This is a story about a pinnacle event for all in collaboration with Michael jackson for his tour and it makes me wonder what life is now like for those individuals.  Michael created team players and they all won.  'It', the tour, did not happen, (too bad) and 'it' did happen- the embodiment of Alan Watts novel \\"This is it\\".  \\"This is it\\" is unfortunately, it, the last time he would be filmed and I can not be anything but sad about that.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I did not know that there were other birds on this game. I love them!!!! din t like the green boomerang though. :c.<br />i think angry birds seasons ties with the originol.
0131479415|5.0|Extremely useful book, filled with first-hand tips and thoughts. These pan out immediately when you have taken your first steps towards Agile project management. The book answers the mirriad questions you're faced with, or at leasts puts you in the right direction. I consider it a must-read for all team members. It helps, though, if you are already familiar with Agile and - preferably - Scrum. If that is so, I can' t imagine a better read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|super fun and its so cool being able to have all those games my favorite game is the wishing one
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Well, just got back from seeing the film.  Wow, I was impressed, I guess when you spend $250 MILLION dollars, you better get your bang for the buck, and Disney really does here!  I loved the books as a lad, and to see the world come to life was pretty darn cool.  I'm getting to be an old fogey (45), and I find myself mostly scoffing at the \\"look at us we can make ANY effect we want with CGI go crazy\\" movies.  But, I got into it here.  As a popcorn movie, this is right up there with all the other over the top super budget, super special effects laden extravaganzas, so you know what you're getting into before you see it, hey, this is a review right?  I will buy this on DVD, and I guess my overriding feeling after just seeing this, is that they have brought to life Edgar Rice Burroughs book, and they have made a tribute to his wonderful imagination.  What a storyteller he was, just how he came up with this stuff is beyond me, but his books brought a lot of enjoyment to me once upon a time, and now, the film did the same, cheers.  Here's hoping that it makes back enough money, maybe even enough to try another film, by the way, really agreed with the \\"official\\" review that the guy did on this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First one is usually the best. The sequels are usually not as great. Having said that you still would want to read the whole trilogy. The first on really sucks you in. I agree the story is twisted. But the twistedness and the awful things that happen in this book is never glorified. Evil is never OK. You will do unjustice to this trilogy if you don't read all the books.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|delivered fast. the album was NOT as good as made  out to be. matalica needs to go back to the old days.
B002AKKLIY|5.0|This album has many of their hits. I bought this because I had most of the songs on tape and wanted to finally get them on cd and this had the same songs on the album plus more good songs.
B006362ZR6|2.0|This is a creative album, different from any of their other work yet. It has a few catch songs but it is not an album that can keep your attention and leave you wanting more.
0061719544|5.0|Great read. It really makes you think about how lucky we are to have been born here and not somewhere else. No whinning, bitching or crying. No blaming others for his shortcomings or bad decisions. This was just an up front, in your face, I did this and this is what happened because of MY CHOICES. This includes the choice to become an American citizen BY CHOICE. How sad that he espouses Americanism more resolutly than many of us that were born here and take it for granted. By it. Read it. Ponder the nuance of each word. Enjoy.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|The quality of the acting was good but the pacing was slow.  We watched this in a group and some liked the switching back and forth and some didn't .  Sometimes it was hard to see which timeframe they portrayed.  It was a true character study but sometimes a bit dry.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Fun and engaging and it is well made too and some levels get quite challenging but I have to get a few more words in to submit.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|It's been years since I've read a book from cover-to-cover in 2 days! The moment I began reading Anita Moorjani's story, I was drawn in. Her words leapt from the page to my heart. I was often moved to tears--in a good way! The wisdom of Anita's words truly resonated with me. This book is a treasure and I recommend it to everyone! Peace
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|To be quite frank, it's good.  I liked it, but I'm 100% glad I didn't read it in print. It's a little bit slow that I probably wouldn't have gotten through out.  Thank goodness for audio.  It's entertaining enough to listen to during my oh so long work day.<br /><br />Check out my full review at: [...]

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game rocks. It is awesome and I haven't ran into any ads in the paid version. So I highly recommend it
0316098329|5.0|\\"Room\\" is a totally unique novel. Written through the eyes of a five year old boy. He know's nothing of the world outside the room he shares with his Ma.<br />I found \\"Room\\" so enjoyable. You feel all of the young narrators emotions, from the unconditional love he feels for his Ma to doubt and fear and all the emotions that come in between. It makes you remember how confusing life can be for a child. It makes you remember how trusting children are and how much they rely on us as parents.<br />Read \\"Room\\", it's sure to make you remember your childhood emotions, no matter how happy or unhappy your childhood was.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|An enjoyable listen from start to finish that leaves you wanting more.  A definite recommendation for any Black Keys fan or any fan of good music.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Initially, I loved this game. Good leveling experience, the recipes were fun, the graphics are very decent, and the social part was kinda fun as well. But a lot of the really fun stuff that you can buy with your restaurant can only be bought with gems, which is, ok...you do get a limited amount but the developers made it so rediculously easy to accidentally spend you gems...probably to encourage you too spend your real-life money on replenishing them. But I completely stopped playing this game when, after 20 levels of saving and collecting gems, I accidentally spent nearly all of them, in 4 accidental transactions in 2 days! Wtf. I would have paid a subscription! But to be &quot;tricked&quot; into spending something I leveled and worked hard to collect destroyed the experience for me. :(
0307593312|3.0|I'm not sure what to make of this book. I was hooked until book 3 or so, where everything takes about 300 pages to tie together in a very unsurprising way. The little people, which make a startling entrance early on, actually become in the larger scheme of the book just a symbolic tool more than a real plot element, which is what I expected.
0143039431|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic book illustrating the difficulties of many Americans during the depression (and the strength of a family to stick together and fight for each other). Though it is definitely not a page turner, and frequently slow, this is perhaps the only book I've read that I find myself frequently telling people they should read.<br /><br />I had a difficult time appreciating the book while reading it; however, I greatly appreciated it upon completion (about 4 years ago) and my appreciation keeps growing. I find the book to be very relevant and a good reminder of how life was for many just 80 years ago, especially when I hear people talking about how difficult or unfair things are today in the US. It's a sad reminder that, although I wouldn't wish the Joads' life on anyone, our society is far removed from the difficulties that instilled strength, resiliency, and a code of honor that made both that generation and this country great.<br /><br />I'm tempted to give this book 4 stars because it's slow and sometimes difficult to get through (though I am a fan of the chapter structure where Steinbeck alternates between long chapters involving the Joads and short anecdotes not involving the Joads but showing further insight into life during that time), but due to its impact on me and my continued frequent recommendation to others to read it, giving it less than 5 stars would be an injustice to this book. Also, I'm not sure who I would broadly recommend this book to, but I would not generally recommend it to younger audiences (who may lack sufficient insight into life and history) as I didn't read it until I was nearly 30 and still needed some time after reading it to fully appreciate it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I confess my daughter recommended this book and at first I thought I wasn't going to like it but I was quickly proven wrong.  While it is somewhat twisted the storyline is easy to follow.  I was disappointed at the end to find that you really don't know what the end is - can't wait to read the second book.  There are three books in the series.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|really fun game that is really easy to get started but includes challenging puzzles .  the physics are reliable and the levels are balanced between easy and difficult.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|great app with a use of my phone's touch screen capabilities.  so far no problems. why does my review have to be so long?
B004HW7JMO|4.0|When it comes to gladiators my only recent film experience to compare this to is [[ASIN:B000NU2CY4 Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]]] . In comparison, this series is much more bloody and explicit in its depictions of Roman decadence. I have no knowledge of how real the depictions of Roman life are but if it were like this, I could see how that civilization fell. Slavery, treachery and orgies are depicted. The story is engaging, but obviously not for everyone with the amount of gore and sex depicted. There are several featurettes, one where the wardrobe designer states she used ancient murals to get the show's designs. I don't know if all in the show is that researched, but some things, like the public bathroom depiction, are interesting indeed. So, I recommend it, especially if you had any interest in Gladiator or ancient Roman society.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My family has this app on every phone, we use it as often as we can. Sadly we have replaced our bibles with it. The convenience of having it with you at all times is great. The only negative is I cant always get every version without a net connection.
0307959856|4.0|If you are a fan of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then this novel will not disappoint. There are multiple Austen spinoffs, but this one, along with Laurie Viera Rigler's Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict, are a fun read.  Having never read a P.D. James novel before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  There was some definite apprehension on my part that it will not live up to the original spirit.  Those trepidations were soon gone, however.  At first, it was a bit strange to read about my favorite characters from P&P, but they were handled with respect and care.<br /><br />A ball was one day away from being held at Pemberley.  But Mr. and Mrs. Darcy had to cancel festivities due to a murder on the premises. Many of the characters from P&P came alive again, in the spirit of Jane Austen's original vision. It was fun to read about Bingley, Jane, Georgina, Colonel Fitwilliam and even Lydia and Wickham.  Even the Gardinars and Mr. Bennet had small parts. The only downfall was not having Kitty in the mix. I thought she could have been used to further the plot without complicating it.  Especially since she was influenced by Lydia's behavior while growing up.<br /><br />I applaud P.D. James for a job well done.  Death Comes to Pemberley was written by a great mystery writer, who was able to add suspense, new characters and yet remain true to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|My favorite Jane Austin story and movie period. Loved the movie from start to finish and I watch it often.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|Red wrecker is challenging puzzle game that will keep you occupied for a very long time. The characters are simple blocks,circles,lines, smiling, frowning but has it's own character & fun to play. Even-though the objective is simple (Save the Green characters) in the game it is very difficult to achieve at times. But that is what that makes this game interesting. The game plays perfectly on Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Kudos to the developer for making this challenging and at the same time making it enjoyable to play.<br /><br />Worth 99c!

B005D9MUWY|4.0|After using SwiftKey for a few days, it becomes very easy to write almost an entire SMS text using the predictive typing suggestions. SwiftKey has, by far, the best prediction of the Android keyboards I've used. I switch between this keyboard and Swype. Swype is faster in some ways for typing with one thumb (simply drag across each letter in the word). I prefer SwiftKey's autocorrect and word suggestions, though.<br /><br />Swiftkey frequently goes on sale, and I'd suggest picking it up any time it does.

B005HBP75K|5.0|Wasn't sure if this would be the type of series I would watch.  Once you start it you will not be able to start.  Story lines are great and the actors really fit their part.  Try it and you'll be sucked in.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Serenity is an excellent sci-fi/action film, with great characters and very entertaining. I had seen part of the movie prior to watching the TV show (Firefly), but watched all of Firefly before I went back and watched the whole movie. It's a great film regardless, but I think the characters and their relationships mean much more if you've watched the TV show.<br /><br />I bought the DVDs of both Firefly and Serenity before I had a blu-ray player, and I will say the blu-ray is a noticeable step up in quality. This blu-ray is an excellent production, and I would recommend (and have recommended) this show to anybody who enjoys an action film that still has a good story and personable characters.

There is so much hidden inside, I simply cannot imagine how Erin Morgenstern does it.<br /><br />The first chapter, wow. So many little nuggets of confusing information. The writing is fluid and captivating. Although it's hard to fall in love with the characters until you're a good chunk into the book. I think this is because the circus is what you are supposed to focus on, but it made it hard to care about the characters. I wanted to see the circus take on a life of its own, since it is supposed to be a character. But instead of that we find out things that have much more impact. (No spoilers, I promise.)<br /><br />The story is one big ball of twine, dropped from a skyscraper and unraveling before your eyes. Secrets come out of the corners, flying at you like the paper birds Marco creates.<br /><br />My one regret with the ending, it was perfect and simple and just wonderful, but I don't really understand why. I don't want to give things away so I'll attempt to explain. Someone is given something, and it just seems like this someone is pulled out of thin air. I don't see the reason. Maybe that just means I need to reread!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I pre-ordered this from Amazon and had it in my hands on release day.  It was with a little trepidation and great excitement that I opened the album (OK, CD, I know, I still roll with the old school Album). First thing I did was pop it into the computer and upload it to iTunes and on to my iPod.<br /><br />I listened to this in pieces, the way I usually do. I'll play parts of a song to see what it's like before I sit down and give it a straight listen all the way through.  I could tell this was going to have a more somber feel right from the start. More \\"Nebraska\\" than \\"Working on a Dream\\".  I've mostly listened to it in the car as I drive to work, at lunch and driving around. The night the cable was out I finally had a chance to give it a listen in one sitting.<br /><br />Haunting, uplifting, poetic, dark humor, soul stealing, passionate, beautiful... All words that came to mind when I listened to it start to finish. Lyrically top notch, musically rich, emotionally moving and satisfying at the same time.<br /> And then there was the sax. Or the lack of it. It was definitely noticeable to me.  But the music stands on its own. Solid. It's just that I could hear the parts where the Big Man would have been... over all, this is a brilliant album. Solid music, superb lyrically and a rich full sound.<br /><br />The booklet that comes with it is fantastic with wonderful photos and a very moving tribute to Clarence Clemons.  The whole package is definitely a 5 star product, especially for a die-hard Bruce fan like me. I would heartily recommend this to anyone.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|My wife and I have been to the Phantom twice and loved the show. Like any live event, there are parts that we weren't able to see as well because of where we were seated and the fact that we were at a live event. We recently watched the video on a 92\\" screen and decided that it would be impossible to have a similar experience at a live performance. The filming and editing were terrific. The sound was amazing. My wife's only complaint was how the crashing chandelier was staged. If you are a fan of the play, you must own this video.
044022425X|5.0|Just finished Drums of Autumn and have already bought The Fiery Cross. This book definitely had a different pace and style than the previous three in the series but I loved it just as much. The book switches POV a lot and sometimes it takes a couple of paragraphs to catch on. I really liked getting to know Brianna and Roger more and LOVED life on Fraser's Ridge. The pace of the book was a bit odd as some sections were very long and only covered a few days and others were shorter and covered months. All in all, though, I have been absolutely delighted with the whole series and I'll be sad to say goodbye to Claire and Jamie in a few years when the last book comes out!
B006P3HXZG|1.0|We  preordered  3-D \\"Puss in Boots \\" and \\"Hugo\\" in  January and got both movies  for kid birthday party. That's why we did not watch movies immediately after we got them.  How much all kids in glasses were disappointed when after long struggle  we were not able to load disk  \\"Puss in Boots\\" , we got \\"damaged disk\\" sort of response. \\"Hugo\\" was loaded and played, but kids counted aloud how many times it was frozen: 27.

1427208476|4.0|In her novel, \\"Sarah's Key,\\" Tatiana de Rosnay works to keep the atrocity of the Holocaust alive, known and unforgotten by ensuring that the modern reader fully understands the long-term effect of the Velodrome D'Hiver roundup of Jewish citizens that occurred in Paris in the summer of 1942.  With knowledge comes regret and perhaps the ability to ascertain that such an event never happens again in the history of humanity. While the novel successfully reminds its readers that the past does not always marry well with the present--the sadness of old ghosts permeates and weakens pillars of hope and the right to happiness--main character Julia's personal quagmire--her unexpected pregnancy, her husband's failure to age gracefully and her anger with regard to what she perceives as the ambivalence of the French people as a whole--trivializes the impact of Sarah's ultimate decision to let the past win with an improbable ending that seems more an afterthought than an actual foregone conclusion.<br /><br />In order to underline the effect of the past on the present, the story is told from alternating perspectives that are relayed along with their 2002 impact as they are discovered.  De Rosnay presents the events as they happen to ten-year-old Sarah Starvinsky who with her mother and father are forced by the French police to deport to an internment camp with thousands of other Jewish/French citizens.  While researching a story commemorating the infamous events associated with the Vel D'Hiv sixty years later, journalist Julia Jarmond suspects that the family apartment which she, her husband and daughter are about to renovate and inhabit was acquired by her in-laws during that fateful summer of 1942.  Bells of alarm trigger Julia's subsequent investigation of the property and its former denizens and what she uncovers disturbs not only her family's fragile equilibrium but shakes her faith in society's negligence in allowing such an event to occur and still call itself humane.<br /><br />Clever and precocious ten-year-old Sarah locks her younger brother in a hidden closet in their Marais apartment in order to hide him from the gendarmes when they arrive to take her family away. Although she physically survives a horrendous ordeal that will forever etch pictures of unspeakable sadness upon her mind, she must then live with the consequences of not only her actions, but those of a frightened world spinning out of control--a world where, in her eyes, safety no longer exists.  De Rosnay drives home the point that the impact of this event on Sarah's ensuing short life symbolizes the death of the integrity of rational egalitarian society, where nothing can be counted on to go right--that personal gain and collaboration with humanity's enemy will come first if such atrocities are allowed to be forgotten without accountability.  As a Holocaust story worthy of remembrance, De Rosnay's story hits its mark with a bleak reality that filters into the present day with all its uncomfortable implications as the story of the young girl and the journalist converges into one.<br /><br />However, even though Sarah's tale draws to its fizzling conclusion through Julia's intrepid efforts, De Rosnay muddies her primary message with too much sentimentality and coincidence with regard to Julia and her self-identity issues.  Presented as an American in Paris--she has lived in Paris as a journalist, wife and mother for over ten years and yet she is still an outsider--Julia struggles with Bertrand, a husband she does not trust, her un-French viewpoint that clearly labels her as an American and her own feelings of failure with regard to not being able to conceive another child.  When she discovers she is pregnant, her initial confusion gives way to joy until she realizes that her husband is happy with his life as it is--without an additional child.  As she experiences a sense of disillusionment for all she has come to rely upon, Julia makes some hard decisions with regardto her future and must \\"come of age\\" in terms of who she really is.  After discovering so many disturbing events that relate in a rather secondhand way to her extended family, it seems reasonable that Julia will indeed feel the effects of post traumatic stress in some degree.  However, De Rosnay almost belittles the sadness of having her characters \\"move on\\" by throwing in the unsuspecting William as a romantic interest at the end of the novel.  The two are drawn together by their knowledge and their participation in the denouement of Sarah's story.  However, their entanglement seems contrived, unnecessary and uncomfortable in light of the more important \\"don't forget\\" Holocaust message.<br /><br />Technically, the book works well from the perspective of its alternating voices.  Sarah's story is told in a third person narrative that strongly suggests the pain of a young child who separated from her beloved parents can only think of the devastating wrong she imposed upon her small brother.  Julia's more contemporary first person account underlines the \\"sins of the father\\" theme of history penetrating modern life with its lessons in passivity and apathy.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation; the reader adequately captures the emotion and abject melancholy of the piece while still maintaining the listeners attention.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"Sarah's Key\\" by Tatiana De Rosnay is a worthwhile Holocaust remembrance piece set in the France of 1942 and 2002. A young girl who may have escaped the death camps cannot move past the sorrow of an event for which she takes full responsibility. In 2002, a forty-year-old journalist researching the 1942 Vel D'Hiv roundup of Jews by the French authorities discovers a family connection that spirals her married life to an unhappy conclusion.  As the mystery of Sarah's key is solved within the first two thirds of the novel, the technical addition of Sarah's voice is abandoned, replaced only by romantic contrivances by De Rosnay that attempt to pull the threads of the story together to create a happy ending.  Recommended with reserve because of the rather hurried and flat conculsion.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"to her future and must \\"come of age\\" in terms of who she really is.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you like Tina Fey (and if you don't, why are you considering getting this book anyway??), you will like this book.  She is funny and smart and it shows in this book.  I like people who don't take themselves too seriously.  And it's always been my stance to laugh at yourself before anyone else has the chance.  Love her.  And love this book.  You want a serous memoir?  Go read about about a president or something.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love this season of The Big Bang Theory.  I brought it to work & we watched it during our lunch hour.  Everyone loved them.  Now they're showing reruns on tv.  All the characters seem to work so well together and Penny seems to balance them out.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Having been a Star Trek fan since watching the original series when it first aired, and enduring the viewing technology of the day, it is incredible to see the series again in the modern format made available today. The picture quality is pristine and sharp. Here is the perfect opportunity to have your kids develop strong, wholesome, character traits from an era gone by. You won't be disappointed. Fascinating!

0439023521|4.0|I just finished this novel after a co-worker recommended it to me. I've seen it on the shelves in bookstores as well as in Amazon recommendations.<br /><br />This is one of those rare books that once you start reading you cannot put it down. The story, the characters, the settings into which they are cast, is entirely plausible from beginning to end. It focuses less on how things happened to bring our Country to this future point and instead places the very well developed characters front and center.<br /><br />You feel as though you are IN the Hunger Games...thrust many decades into the future where a government has been erected out of fear rather than out of liberty.<br /><br />If you love suspense, then this is a definite MUST READ. Do not see the movie first. Read the book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is somewhat annoying because of the adds but they aren't as bad as some of the reveiws make it out to be but it is not worth five stars. also I don't know why someone said it cant be downloaded on the kindle fire I had no problem.

I recommend it.

1609611543|5.0|OK. After reading the first ten pages I am convinced!  The author describes me exactly!<br />Based on what little I know about genetics I am  inclined to agree that modern wheat bears little resemblance to ancient wheat. And wheat is not the only thing that has changed! Dogs. Chickens. Cows. Other crops. Indeed humans have changed too! How about \\"round-up ready\\" soy beans anyone? B-T corn? OMG what does THAT code for??<br /><br /> A few years back my grocery store offered \\"Bible Bread\\". It was made with Spelt! I wonder if it's still there?<br /><br /> So I challenge you to a simple experiment: Get off wheat and watch what happens. See  if you don't start feeling better and losing weight. Heck get off carbohydrates as much as possible. If you just have to have it try to find products made with older varieties of grain.<br /><br /> This is the best use of ten bucks I know about. Buy the book or download to your iPad or Kindle. Start down a different path. The path to recovery!

B003O86FMW|4.0|I read the hunger games a week before I read this book!  It was great to hear whats going on in district 12.  What goes on kept me in shock till the end! I liked the first book better and I didn't expect most of the things that occurred.  It was such a good book and I'm looking forward to the 3rd book!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|simple, moderately challenging, and enjoyable. enough variety to maintain my interest. well designed and entertaining. I would have paid for this game and I look forward to more!
B005VTS4EY|3.0|Gets much more challenging as levels go. Good way to pass the time.<br />Not bad at all. No complaints since is was free app of the day but I might buy anyway after a little demo play.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|I rented this to watch on a long flight, so I didn't need it to be great, just mildly entertaining. And I had heard that it wasn't very good, but I liked the idea, so I thought I would enjoy it. But it let me down, even from those low expectations. It was really dumb. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money. There is no credibility to it. It's just foolish.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Just as good as the day I saw it in the theater way back in June 1989.  Some elitist fans bag on the Burton and Shumacher films but I find the two Burton films hold up extremely well.  Keaton is still my all time favorite Batman/Bruce Wayne.  Burton's films have always had a nice balance of comic book fantasy and reality, I don't think anyone has done it better than he has.  I find the Nolan films to fall flat in this area.  He tries to make them far more realistic and it's kind of hard to take seriously when Christian Bale sounds like he has a speech impediment while playing Batman.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Everything worked great. It was a good price on black firday. We watch it over and over. Excellent story. Shipped quickly.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Three years ago Barbara Demick's penetrating journalistic skills revealed the ever-present desperation of North Korean life in Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea. Now comes Adam Johnson with an equally brilliant book, a novel, that digs beneath the artificial veneer of life in North Korea to examine the mindless lives of its people, from the lowliest convict to the Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, himself.<br /><br />Johnson's Orwellian story surveys life in an orphanage; the experience of a tunnel rat, trained in hand-to-hand combat in the tunnels leading under the DMZ to South Korea; espionage and kidnapping trips to Japan in \\"fishing boats\\"; the life and lifestyle of the country's elite military commanders and of the Dear Leader himself; the vain efforts of an official torturer to retain his humanity; and the semblance of life that is existence in a North Korean prison mine, where citizens who run afoul of officialdom are worked to death underground with picks and shovels.<br /><br />Johnson's themes are the loss of identity in a setting where every aspect of life is controlled from above; the disparity between truth and propaganda; and the struggle between love and loyalty.<br /><br />The experience of reading this complex and wide-ranging tale is shattering. It took me twice as long to finish this book as it might ordinarily have done, because so very often I had to set it aside to catch my breath or stanch the tears that threatened to come. I was deeply moved by Barbara Demick's book. Adam Johnson's novel upended me, with its unsparing portrayal of the extremes of pain and degradation to which the North Korean people are subjected.<br /><br />Adam Johnson is a San Francisco short story writer and novelist who teaches creative writing at Stanford. He spent three years researching this novel, including a trip to North Korea, where he visited several cities and learned first-hand what life is like under a truly totalitarian regime.<br /><br />([...])
B000JQUKKU|4.0|I have enjoyed this book, as it is for kids over 12 the reason i like it is because it is a wonderful classic to our kids. it does talk about the original play and if you have seen it is is really good. the book is based on that. i have seen the play and now have read the book. it is most enjoyable to read when watching tv. or just having some time to read. thanks for this great product hope i can sugest it to others as well.<br /><br />  rebekah mccallie

B001L4NJIO|3.0|I found this DVD/CD combination packet of The Police Certifiable live concert recording in Buenos Aires on the bargain rack at my local Ross Stores. Mmmmm, good. That's just the type of thing I look for and under 10 bucks. The Police were one of my favorite groups back in New Wave Days of the late 70s and early 80s. This package contains two DVDs of the concert itself, and I'll note it first. Then, in addition, there are two CDs of the live reunion concert and I'll devote the last part of the review for them.<br /><br />It's great to see the Police again and they look to be in good form. All look fit and healthy, even after 30 years. Their music is delightful, but it's nowhere near as good as their original recordings. Well, you could say this about most music groups so it's not fair criticism. Obviously the crowd loved the performance and I can easily understand. The visuals are quite good but the sound is terrible. You don't really notice this all that much when you're watching the performance as your attention is split between the visuals and the sound. It becomes much more apparent when you listen to only the CDs and I listened to and commented on the CDs first. Visually as viewed on the DVDs, it's a great concert and it's fun to watch.<br /><br />Please note that the rest of this review is for the two CDs only. First and foremost, the sound on these CDs is just awful. I'm a bit of an audiophile and I have a stereo system that is fairly good (100 watt amp per channel, two three-way speakers with 12-inch woofers and an 80-watt powered subwoofer). The sound on many CDs comes across as clean and clear and crisp on my system. The deadmau5 \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" comes to mind. Well, the Police CDs are way too loud. I like loud music, by the way, and play it that way all the time. However, with these Police CDs I have to turn the stereo down a couple notches. It's that loud over my ordinary listening level. And even then, the sound quality is miserable. Everything sounds indistinct and \\"mushy\\" and my household furniture is rattling even at the lower volume level. I'd have to guess that part of this is due to very poor concert hall acoustics. I feel fatigued after listening to one CD, let alone two.<br /><br />A second part includes the songs. I love them. But, they're nowhere nearly as well done as they were on the original 80s recordings. Not even close. I suppose this is to be expected. After all, everyone in the group has aged for three decades and that takes a toll. Plus, they haven't played together for a long time. So, what can I say? If you're a big Police fan, then you're going to have these DVDs and accompanying CDs. I can understand. If you just want to listen to some pristine Police music, get the old LPs or their unaltered CD equivalents. They're excellent! Absolutely pristine! You'll love them!<br /><br />In one of the reviews, someone said they cried when they heard the Police again on this reunion tour, and I can understand. Well, I felt like crying too, but only because the songs were so poorly rendered and with such low sound quality.<br /><br />Gary Petersong sounds indistinct and \\"mushy\\" and my household furniture is rattling even at the lower volume level.

0618001905|5.0|Hochschild's wonderfully written history of Leopold's outrageous colonial scheme brings to life remarkable personalities, presenting a vast canvas of human suffering and some of the heroic attempts at redemption. The fascinating array of personalities and historical forces makes this book a page turner from beginning to end. Leopold's disgusting avarice and the greed of his minions brought horror on a scale unimaginable in those times and created the first modern \\"human rights\\" campaign. This book is a \\"must\\" for serious students of colonialism, Africa, and human rights, to name but a few areas of study it touches on.

014241722X|4.0|As a mother who screens everything her 12-going-on-13-year-old daughter reads, I remember when I picked up my first John Grisham: \\"A Time to Kill\\", and, as a result, I was totally hooked on John Grisham, then, later, Umberto Eco (\\"Foucault's Pendulum\\"), for the longest time. I was torn being skeptical and excited when I heard that John Grisham had written a book for middle-schoolers. After all, Rick Riordan and Kathy Reichs had both also written successfully for adults before writing for younger readers. Was John Grisham just jumping on the bandwagon in that sense? Or did he actually have something solid to offer this increasingly competitive market of children's literature?<br /><br />Although I found \\"Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer\\" a little heavier than necessary on legalese, I appreciate that kids who aren't so in tune with the nuances of law would welcome the information. I loved that the adults in Theodore Boone's lives are not all duds (see previous reviews) and are, in fact, given credit for his life savvy. My take on the book itself: I think John Grisham writes better for adults. That said, I thought it was a really good introduction for said daughter to legal thrillers - and I can't wait for her to pick up John Grisham's other books, including the Theodore Boone sequels. Now all we need is for Dan Brown to write a middle-school thriller! Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\"The book, `Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer' by John Grisham is an exciting read about one boy and his role in one of the biggest criminal cases in his city.<br /><br />\\"In the small city of Strattenburg, there are many lawyers, and even though he is only thirteen years old, Theo Boone considers himself one of them. Theo knows every judge, policeman, court clerk - and a lot about the law. But then, when a man murders his wife for her life insurance and is about to get off scott-free, Theo suddenly finds himself in the court room a lot sooner then expected. But will Theo be able to prove the man's guilt? Or will the guilty walk free?<br /><br />\\"My favorite part was definitely when Theo helps his friend, Sandy, out when his family is about to be evicted from their house by giving them free advice and telling them what lawyers they can go to, who are good and who will help them. I think that it was very cool how Theo helped him for free. I also think that it was cool how Sandy did exactly what Theo told him to do - I mean, how many people do you know would trust their house and family's future to a thirteen-year-old kid?<br /><br />\\"My favorite character was, of course, Theo. I think that it was really funny how he was a better lawyer than most of the real adult lawyers in the court room, and I liked how he handled the murder case when he found evidence and a witness to it.<br /><br />\\"I would give the book 4 stars: two stars for the plot and two stars for the characters. However, I didn't like how the book just stopped at the end without saying what happened next, so I hope there is a sequel! :-)\\"

0679731725|5.0|I wish I had read 'Remains' before I saw the movie (still one of my faves)so many times.  Would I have heard Stevens'voice differently? Anthony Hopkins' and Emma Thompson's brilliant preformances narrated the novel for me...almost like reading an audio book.<br /><br />But having said that, it is a beautiful read. As other reviewers have said, this author packs more emotion, character developement, and history into < 200 pages than most of his contemporaries do in 1000. As perfect as a book can be.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is an ok app. I was not really all that impressed with it and some of the games are a little childish.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my son and I really enjoy this app. it has a lot of different challanges that are fun and not just frusrtrating. I would reccomend it to anyone. worth the wait.you should definetly get this app if you have kids it will keep them busy while you run errands or go to doctor visits.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|A great packaging for a great TV series.

B007IQX1G4|1.0|This movie was horrible! I was so boring I couldn't even make it through the entire movie, even though I tried four times. I wouldn't recommend it to others. Really drags on... I'm so glad I didn't see it in the theater like I wanted too!

B004IE9X5W|5.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels. The life lessons to be learned are dispensed in a gentle, non judgmental manner, and the characters could be met at any time in any age. A must read (as far as I am concerned)I purchased the Kindle version so that I have it with me when I travel. Here my issue is that the reproduction was choppy.
0340881542|5.0|My 13 year old son can't get enough of Robert Muchamore.  I've been trying to get him to use his new Kindle, but he is so wrapped up in Cherub books!!  Can't wait for the rest of the US to wake up and see what they've been missing in Muchamore!
B00729GQ0A|4.0|3.5 of 5 Stars<br /><br />Sophia always knew she was \\"different.\\"  However, after a night out gone bad, she learns that being \\"different\\" is relative.  In one night, Sopie's life is drastically changed when she is targeted by supernatural beings and thrust into the world of the paranormal.  In order to stay safe, Sophia must accept her \\"curse,\\" learn how to live in the new world of the supernatural, and hopefully keep her new lover.<br /><br />It took me a little while to get into the story.  At the beginning of the book, the pacing is pretty slow as Sophia slowly learns about the paranormal world and gets to know Charles, a man who seems attracted to her but also determined to avoid her.  I felt that for a girl who has always been different, Sophia is pretty slow to accept the paranormal.  She does spells herself, but still doesn't fully believe in the paranormal beings that she has seen with her own eyes.<br /><br />As Sophia starts coming around and accepting the new revelations, the story begins to pick up.  The enemy changes up a bit, the plot begins to thicken, and Sophia and Charles' relationship starts to heat up as well.  I do like the relationship between Charles and Sophia, there is definitely no instant-love.  While they are both very attracted to each other, they don't just jump into a full relationship, and I appreciate the believability of their relationship.<br /><br />By the end of the story, I was fully engaged with the characters, and enmeshed in the plot.  There are twists and turns in the end of the book that fully set up future books in the series and change the nature of the story.  By then end of the book, Sophia is no longer a timid, \\"different,\\" girl.  She is a part of the paranormal world and there is much to come for her and Charles.<br /><br />With an inventive and fresh paranormal world and a sweet, not overly sensual romance, The Forever Girl is a satisfying paranormal read.<br /><br />There may have been a slow start, but the plot picks up and the paranormal world created is inventive and fresh.  So, I rate The Forever Girl 3.5 out of 5 Stars.  For readers who enjoy urban fantasy and paranormal books, I recommend giving this book a try.<br /><br />*I received this book for review*ks up and the paranormal world created is inventive and fresh.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is an awesome product.  Its very convenient that I was able to purchase all of the movies in one set.  It was less expensive too to purchase them together.
0060899190|5.0|This was my very first Post Secret book that I not only read, but own as well. There were some very interesting bits in the book and some very shocking ones too. I swear I felt normal after having read a few of the entries and also had a few of my friends read some of the book. It helped a few to feel better, to laugh, even realize that the situation they were in wasn't as big of a deal afterwards.
B003YV0A02|5.0|One of the best action movies ever. One where the bad guys are not complete idiots and have a little depth of character. The first one is still the best in the series. Hollywood at it's best.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I purchased this movie on the day it came out, and gave it to my 21 month old daughter for Valentine's Day. Although, long feature length movies don't hold her interest the entire time, the movie was packaged well and was a fantastic price.  Who can go wrong with Disney and Amazon?
B003V1WTMM|2.0|It was a struggle but I finally finished this book. Why is another question. Perhaps because I loved Forgotten Garden and just kept assuring myself that the author I so enjoyed there would finally make an appearance here. Sadly, she never did. This book just went on and on and on....page after page of 'description' with nary a word of dialog, not a thing to advance the plot in sight. The 'names' of people, not 'characters' that took up space. Nothing about them drew or held my interest, no development to lead me to that caring place, nothing. A real let down for this reader. Only pure cussed stubborness allowed me to finish and even the pay off at the conclusion left me with a huge yawning, so-what feeling. If this is your first exposure to Kate Morton I fear it will be the last and you will miss this excellent author in much better efforts.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Challenging fun game especially after level 30, Permissions seem to be slightly more than those that would be required for this game, but not excessively so.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|The latest installment of Jane Eyre does its best to separate itself from the many other film versions, and, while some areas are effective(scenery, mood, atmosphere), there are too many flaws that keep it from being better than average. As it is , it is a mediocre telling of the story, passable and worthy of a viewing, but nothing beyond that.<br /><br />Told in an unconventional way, this version uses flashbacks as a basis for getting through much of Jane's story, pretty much ditching the \\"voice over\\" narration. We are taken back to Jane's early upbringing and subsequent arrival at Thornfield, and then fast forward to later portions. While this is a fresh approach to the story, the one negative is simply that it is  harder to get fully invested in the plot's momentum, one minute Jane being a young girl, the next a governess, then back to her as a young girl. The jumpy narrative destroys a little of the novel's power.<br /><br />Another issue is characterization. For instance, the scene where Jane and Rochester meet could have been handled better. Fleeting moments are scattered throughout that depict Jane and Rochester relationship, but for the most part these are taken on in a superficial fashion, a bit dumbed-down. Rochester, cynical and alienated in other films, comes across as way too sympathetic. Not only that, but where is Rochester in the film's first thirty minutes? There are several scenes that really don't capture the power they could have had, either because they are glossed over artificially or they lack any conviction. Also, this version misses chunks of significant plot essential to forming characters and their motives (such as the relevance of Grace Poole).<br /><br />I don't want to be overly critical, because it is a decent film. One plus of this version is simply the ambience, the dark feel of the story, especially at Thornfield. A mystery lies within those walls and we can feel that in Jane's exploration of the place. The scenery and \\"feel\\" of the story is definitely there.<br /><br />However, this film doesn't have any qualities that make it noteworthy. In the end, I felt it was a lukewarm effort, where you really don't feel too much either way how things turn out. It's difficult to be too invested in any of the characters, either.
B002DZX94Y|5.0|Something I've been looking for.  A large collection of the many performances of this magnificient lady.  Put them in my CD changer and have hours of great music.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have a lot of spare time on my hands, and this game well 101 games makes it go by quicker. the games are simple yet challenging in some ways. overall the games is great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading the WOOL omnibus. I was very pleasantly surprised. My expectations for kindle books have not been that high in the past (what do you expect for $0.99).<br />However, that was not the case with WOOL. The story was good. The dialogue was good. The characters were believable and realistic. I don't recall noticing a single typo in the entire omnibus. For the \\"cheap\\" sci-fi I've been reading on the kindle, that's a first.<br />Thanks for the great story. I'll be passing along the word.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Requires thought. You earn enough hints to move on but not so many that the game is too easy and you lose interest.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been an EverNote User for years. this works on my new kindle fire exactly as I expect it to.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Awesome CD, Amazing Voice... Takes me back to Frankie... A great CD to unwind to with a class of wine, or play when having a evening dinner, or on a date.  Or whenever you are in the mood for some classic tunes to dance around to, this is a choice that will not let you down!
0307959856|5.0|I found this book to be not only entertaining for its content but for its literary style as well. I feel that P.D. James captured the essence of Austen in this book while presenting a good mystery story with a surprise ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to other Austen fans.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|the reason I gave this game 3 stars is because it can get boring.don't get me wrong,this game is super fun it just gets boring.over all though,this a a good buy.I would highly recommend it for little children.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Spark's books. This was by far his best ever for me. It had a twist and kept me turning the pages until the end!!!!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Great puzzle game.  Works great on the Kindle fire. Will be one game that I will be sharing with the grandkids.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is even better than the 10th Anniversary Celebration. First, is the whole musical, all the songs...The  images<br />are fabulous, very clear. The performers very good, one or other not so good as in the 1995's presentation.<br />The conductor is the same. The choir is also great, hundreds of singers. Almost 3 hours of a great show.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fun app to purchase. Great variety of games and fun for all. Passes the free time quickly
B006OCM0G0|5.0|omg!!! I liv this game I just got it and I'm already spending most of my time on it!!!! I love how u get to own ur own resteraunt its soooooooo much fun!!!!!! get it and u wont be sorry I got it for my fire and I love it!!!!:)
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Indeed, a fun game to waste time on. A few of the levels are frustrating, but I breezed through all 100 stages in only about 90 minutes of actual playing time. Needs more stages, higher difficulty settings, a challenge mode...
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I love Cohen but I agree that he has (as do all artists) gone up and down over the years. This album is an up one - no doubt about it. Yes, it's melancholy yes it's dark and gloomy but, I'm thinking that the man knew what he was doing while the tracks were being laid. Now, an admission, I bought the album on the day after its release  - I'm listening to it fr the first time today. What a great Sunday afternoon treat!
B003L77G06|5.0|Modern Family brings a breath of fresh air to television, as it is reminiscent of the good old, family friendly shows of the early 90's (ie- Family Matters, Full House, Step By Step, Boy Meets World, etc). Each episode is packed full of hilarious moments, running plots, and always ends with a positive message for the viewer to really think about.<br /> The acting is first class, the characters are easy to fall in love with, and lets be honest... who doesn't want the chance to see Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and Claire (Julie Bowen) in all their beauty for a full half hour?<br /> If you want a break from the monotonous lineup of reality shows and Jersey Shore-like characters TV currently offers, then I highly recommend getting into Modern Family. Start with the 1st Season, as it will help you build an understanding of each character, their personality, and their history. By that time, I guarantee you will be hooked, and purchasing this (second season) won't be a second thought for you.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|fun and challenging I wasn't sure if Iwould like the game but figured my kids would. I was wrong and the kids have to beg to get it from me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really enjoy this Bible especially the daily reading plan. You can also receive a reminder so you don't miss a day of reading
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Well balanced game, a couple challenging levels.  Good visuals and sound effects, kids screaming always a plus!  Runs great on my Thunderbolt.
0060506989|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie. Patriotic, heartbreaking, endearing...a war story...a love story...a man's movie and a woman's movie. Worth every penny to buy it...worth every minute watching it...over and over and over as we have.<br /><br />Sherry
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The start of this book is wonderful and makes you go back to that first love that you will always remember. I loved it! BDSM is not for everyone. I personally have tried the dark side of these acts and it was good for the time.  James did a very good job at the description giving \\"vanilla\\" people a look into another side.  Bravo!  I'm off to read your second book. I hope it as good as the first one.
0545425115|5.0|I have never read a book so quickly! This book was amazing and I couldn't put it down! I like YA fiction but don't read them enough. This has renewed my love for YA books.<br /><br />I've been trying to describe this book to others without giving too much away and I think it's a combination of Survivor, 1984, and The Hatchet. While we know there's going to be death, it's not gory or gruesome while still keeping the reader interested. Also, while there's a bit of romance (it's YA and therefore a given) it's not sexual or inappropriate at all. The vocabulary is appropriate for the age. The pace of the book is fast! There are no page breaks in the book. When there is a point where a time break occurs (i.e. overnight) Collins just forges ahead in the next chapter. All of the chapter endings are cliff hangers which make you want to keep reading even more!<br /><br />Yes, it's about death and it's a YA book. If you're not sure if it's appropriate for your child to read, you read it first. Don't dismiss these books simply because of what you think you \\"know\\" about the plot. There are many opportunities for discussions about \\"what if\\" with a young adult regarding the story and how it may relate to their life. I don't understand adults who feel the need to restrict reading material based on the subject, especially if the adult hasn't read it themselves yet. It's reading! It's better than TV and video games, isn't it?!?<br /><br />I can't wait to read the second and third books, starting as soon as this is posted! And \\"may the odds be EVER in your favor!\\"
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I got this from Audible on one of the $4.99 sales - after listening to about half of it, I bought the 2nd book because I didn't want to have to wait to start it.  The writing is excellent and the narration is excellent also.  I hope the 3rd book comes out soon.
B001B93H0O|5.0|Excellent customer service! DVDs arrived quickly. One was mislabeled but the company immediately sent me the<br />correct one after notification

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|*Spoiler ahead*<br /><br />  I did not listen to the warnings from the reviews of book two and I was extremely glad that I did not. While there were irritatingly too many moments of \\"choose me Katniss\\" moments, the book overall was fairly satisfying.<br />This is not a review of the second book, but given the cliffhanger ending of two... The reader is obligated to read three. In my opinion, this is a flawed approach when such promises lead to a very empty reading experience given what we had before.<br /><br />  The third is a bit slower in some ways than the other two, but it really felt like the ship rapidly losing its wind halfway through the book. Aside from the characters devolving (no other word for it) into caricatures of their former selves, with the all too timely placement of Deus medicalis stringing the readers hopes along of a return to better character development for much of the book, the ending crashes in a heap of lost potential.<br /><br />  The ending cascades between multiple characters dying, the rebellion ending in success, and Coin receiving her dues. One of the central pillars of the series (protecting Prim) is thoughtlessly discarded, leaving at least this reader with less of a \\"gut punch\\" literary effect and more of a complete dissociation with characters that made this series good before. The reasoning behind such an act as killing Prim is a poorly executed and rushed affair. There's not much else to say on the topic really, since clearly this book has a divided fan base.<br /><br />  So my warning is this to fellow fans, this is not the book you will expect. This will likely not be the book that you will first grab to re-read if you grab any one of the trilogy. With that warning, know that reading this is mandatory if you like the series, I just wish that the author had kept the magic throughout the series and given it the ending it, the fans, and the author deserved to see.<br /><br />2/5 from me, based only on its pedigree and the few portions of interest the book held.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|this is one of the best free apps amazon has offered. don't hate just download it. If you can't run it buy a real phone.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This seasons is definitely more challenging than its predecessors. I like the extra 'dragon challenge' on each level. I find it more difficult to obtain 3 stars. All in all, the progression and added effects are very fun. I'm hooked and will continue to work at it until all are defeated.
B000E33VWW|5.0|I thought this wasnt going to be good quality but it was, no scratches or anything and it played fine.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|If you love Supernatural and are a fan of Bobby, you have to read this book. The whole time I was reading it, I could totally hear Bobby's voice (they should get Jim Beaver to do the audiobook). I felt that it was very true to the show and the character. Another awesome thing about this book is that it answered several questions that I've had forever about Bobby and his past. This is a definite must read.
1451648537|5.0|This book has a vision of someone that had the opportunity to talk, see and live next to Steve Jobs in his last days. You get to learn about the ways of a person who change the way we perceive the world.<br /><br />Great reading for those who are pasionate or haven't found what to do with ther lifes, here is an example of somebody who found very early his purpose and the consequences that had in many others.

B000J5XS3C|4.0|The unit itself is a joy to use - not a problem at all. The thing to watch, is the power supply. There is no facility on the Amazon website to specify the type of supply for your region of the world, so it defaults to the USA type. Understandable for an American website I suppose, but not so good if the product comes with a selection of supplies for differnt parts of the world.....
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game and worth the small cost.  Many levels are very challenging and all have nice graphics.  A great way to stretch your thinking outside of the box.
B0063GORYU|5.0|good stuff works great few ads though. keeps your high score. free. good. great gameplay. the graphics are alright. keep same deck.
1469984202|5.0|It's not often I feel the need to write a review about a book, but after staying up several late, late nights in a row - and at the expense of my graduate studies- sorry Professor!- I realized I haven't read a story this rich and genuine in a long, long time.<br />As a big believer of life is too short to read bad or mediocre books, I enthusiastically give this as many stars as possible.<br /><br />I'll admit, I'm late to the Wool scene, so if you're like me and intrigued by the reviews on here, I HIGHLY recommend you dive right into the Omnibus. The compilation of all the short stories seamlessly blend into one meaty and engaging story. I honestly couldn't tell you where one short story ended and another began. I find it very hard to believe that the author didn't have the entire concept in mind from the beginning. It's THAT well-written.<br /><br />So if you're wondering if you should get this book, stop wondering and get it already. You won't regret it.<br />You can thank me later.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoyed the challenging puzzles in the new Quell game! I also loved the soundtrack! I'm a sucker for some good classical. :)

I have a lot of c programming guids and books on the shelf however none are as portable and quick but good ref to the ANSI c standards.<br /><br />I just wish the quality of the paper was better also the font they used can sometimes hard to follow specially during the midnight. I really like this and i would buy it again if there is a better quality of print available.<br /><br />thanks you Dennis and Brian and all other guys whoever worked on this artwork.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading the New York Times trend story on Grey I felt it must have enough merit to warrant a read. Wrong.<br />I have a couple of fundamental issues with this book. First the plot was entirely predictable. Those comparing this story to Twilight hit it spot on. Second...I dont understand what is likeable about either Anastasia Steele or Christian Grey. Both are severely flat characters and I didnt get any real character progression other than Anastasia being a complete virgin and then suddenly engaging in erotic BDSM sex. Third..the writing. Ive always read tha writers should write what they know. If this is true...EL James must have grown up in the eighteen hundreds. I caught myself spontaneously laughing throughout the book simply because the dialogue was so unbelievable. Lastly...was this book copyedited...I got distracted by the amount of typos and misplaced commas.<br />If this is the book to revive your sex life I feel sad for you. Find something with better writing and some spicier characterization.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Although this story takes quite some time to develop it eventually grips the reader and holds you to a \\"hard to put down\\" story.<br />Well worth the effort to read the firt half of the book before thee story moves into top gear and races to the end of the third book.<br />Pity we wont see any more from Larsson
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book was so exciting I couldn't stop reading.  I love all the characters, even the evil ones.  You just never new what was going to happen.  No one was safe.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book may have been targeting teenagers? But I couldn't put the book down and enjoyed the character telling the story.  The premise was interesting and of course if you want to draw analogies to the present day, the parallels between the first world (Capitol) and the third world (Districts) are clear.  It is sort of a toned down Margaret Atwood story. All that aside, just a good action read, recommend for the beach and can't wait to see the movie...
B00004YYDI|5.0|As something of a hyper-critical film-lover, I was stunned by the 'Uncut International' (ie made-for-intelligent-grown-ups) version of this fantastic movie.<br /><br />At the heart of this darkly-textured tale is one of the most touchingly tender love stories I've ever witnessed on film. Any suggestion of 'paedophilia' (I'm sure that not ALL Americans have popcorn for brains) is simply risible.<br /><br />Unless you're merely interested in the gun-play (spectacular though it is), DON'T waste your money on the 'American' made-for-people-with-small brains-but-big-hang-ups version.<br /><br />And if you've been misled into expecting a little (forbidden) sexual titillation, don't buy EITHER ! This is NOT `Lolita-with-Violence.'<br /><br />More like `Silas Marner-with-Guns'.<br /><br />Instead, you have that rare thing - a thriller with a beating heart.<br /><br />Leon is a professional hit-man from Italy - emotionally and intellectually still something of a child. He doesn't even know how to read properly. But in the Dark Arts of killing, he's a Zen Master.<br /><br />Mathilda is the abused Cinderella of a dysfunctional slob family: Ma's a hooker, Dad's a drug-dealer, and Big Sis is an overweight and vindictive bully. Only her much-loved little brother gives her life meaning and purpose. In short, she is already - at the tender age of 12 - old beyond her years.<br /><br />What is more (Horror of Horrors), she smokes !<br /><br />She is played with stunning (and heart-breaking) professionalism by young Israeli-born Natalie Portman.<br /><br />(And I defy ANY middle-aged man not to fall at least a LITTLE in love with her himself !)<br /><br />Into her life - following the brutal murder of her family by corrupt cops led by the most wonderfully insane character in Gary Oldman's distinguished repertoire - comes Leon. He becomes her emotional refuge and protector - and a reluctant teacher of the skills necessary to a professional killer (in order for her personally to avengethe murder of her family).<br /><br />What a comment upon Modern American Values, that the (supposed) moral dubiety of a `forbidden' relationship between Adult and Child should arouse more fierce criticism from the ethically-purblind than that of tutoring a 12-year-old how to kill !<br /><br />The tender bond that develops between them is what gives the film its satisfying emotional appeal. Desperate for love herself, she offers him (eventually) not only such love, but also her body. He declines the latter, but becomes aware of a gnawing need for the former.<br /><br />It is in this sense - and this sense only - that you could describe their relationship as something of a `love affair'. But if so, then it's one of most chaste and innocent kind. One might even say `Platonic'.<br /><br />The Woman in Mathilda's child instinctively recognises Leon's emotional needs.<br /><br />And the Child in Leon's adult responds accordingly, his long-repressed Desire for Life re-kindled by a precocious child. The tender irony is delicious.<br /><br />Love, you see, does not always obey the laws of an accepted societal formula. Nor is it particular about the environment in which it flourishes. It is its own fulfilment, and writes its own rules of engagement.<br /><br />And if you can witness their final parting without a sense of loss and sadness, then you have clearly never been touched by it yourself.<br /><br />Just buy it !

0307346617|4.0|The history of the Zombie War. This is meant to be fairly contemporary and historically accurate, with actual places (cities, towns, countries) with actual names and culturally relevant occurrences that reflect historical events that preceded the war. For instance - one minor reference to Portland, ME's \\"Deering Oaks Park\\" - I used to live right across from it, and a few mentions to Burlington, VT (my home state).<br /><br />Through a series of `interviews' the author connects the dots of a) where and how the Z-germ spread (China, z-germ, Black-Market organs); b) the first theories and hypotheses (`African Rabies'); c) militarization, d) civilian action, e) government infighting & many other hazards of the war.<br /><br />Most interesting to myself would be the theory of it all. To see the ever growing number of Undead, Ghouls, Zedheds, Z's or whatever other pseudonym they took - to get to the root of the `how' and `why' then witness the subsequent military action, both joining together and falling out of categories of people (Quasies, Ferals, Rebels) based on their psychologies. It seems that Brooks has accounted for a plethora of reactions to the war. Ranging from near immediate suicide for fear that tomorrow would be the same to psychological stalwart with the `quasies' near the middle (akin to Stockholm Syndrome). He also, albeit very late, espouses the importance of dogs (`K's') in sniffing out, baiting and reconnaissance of the Z's during the war.<br /><br />The tactics of war changed and left many unprepared although it seems all too easy. Zombies are slow and `can be outdistanced at a fast walk' but the military's super-weapons were rendered useless - the Airforce was rendered good for one thing: supply drop - while hand-to-hand (with weaponry; not necessarily firearms) and the sniper mantra `one shot; one kill' were the most effective ways to eliminate the droves of Z's. It is difficult to believe that so many perished when the enemy had one advantage, and only one: pure & replenishable numbers.<br /><br />While this is nothing original it was a certainly unique style with which to write the fictitious history of WWZ - each P.O.V. building on the next with a few narratives over-lapping to confirm or insult the other (political at many points) and eventually leaving off with the world in a state of relative tranquility but still suffering a few `white-zones' but attempting to get-on and rebuild.only one: pure & replenishable numbers.<br /><br />While this is nothing original it was a certainly unique style with which to write the fictitious history of WWZ - each P.O.V. building on the next with a few narratives over-lapping to confirm or insult the other (political at many points) and eventually leaving off with the world in a state of relative tranquility but still suffering a few `white-zones' but attempting to get-on and rebuild.
0385344325|4.0|There is no point in reviewing Lee Child.<br /><br />You know what you are going to get.<br /><br />The setting changes, the situation changes and in The Affair we are told this is a flashback to the early days of Jack Reacher as the legendary and all-powerful Mr. Fix-It.<br /><br />So Reacher is allegedly younger but still, the formula is the formula. We know Reacher must both tease and battle the mysterious forces and put his fist in a few faces and, of course, bed at least one lady, usually the most mysterious and alluring and most visible one on Reacher's radar.<br /><br />There's the toothbrush, the personal upkeep, the clean shirts, the math, the ability to track time without a clock, the lack of wordly possessions. Reacher is a bad-ass bohemian. He's Batman, Bond and Clint Eastwood in \\"Hang `Em High.\\" He's the Lone Ranger and Jackie Chan and Buford Pusser. He can't be intimidated, never flinches and feels cheated if he only gets to take on a handful of punks at once. He kills with his hands.<br /><br />The Reacher novels are carefully defined mystery-thrillers that pack a satisfying wallop of entertainment. Events are fantastic. The enemies are uniformly formidable. Reacher needs no help. We see what he sees until Reacher is already on the move, about to mete out considerable justice before he lets us in on who did what to whom and why.<br /><br />For consistency book to book, it doesn't get much better than the Jack Reacher series.  The situations change but Jack Reacher does not. The Affair is another solid entry--over the top and lots of fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a bit skeptical at first.. I most definately shouldn't have been. great games for all types. highly recommended for those who strive for better gameplay
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Challenging and enjoyable game. There are lots of levels and a decent progression of difficulty. Well worth the 49 cents.
B005VTS4EY|1.0|This review is based solely on permissions. It looks like other people think this is a good game. But everybody is right. How can you charge money for an app that uses you for information. If we get enough people to just give every app that does this a one star review, it might eventually make a difference.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Excelent episodes and storyline. The people spoke with the selection of the show in the people choice award!! Congratulacions to the stars, writers and all who colaborate with the development of the program
B00351YEVC|4.0|This is the first book I've read on the subject and on a Kindle read the ending was rather disturbing. You're getting drawn into a story and there are no pages left to turn.I'm glad to have read this book.I didn't know!
0393338827|5.0|The Big Short is a very thorough research on the few people who foresaw the recent housing market bubble and how they had to fight to get their ideas through.<br /><br />As always, Michael Lewis is a master at storytelling, and he skillfully leads you through the financial universe, explaining how decisions were made, (or not made), and how the regulatory institutions failed the american consumer and the world in general.<br /><br />A must read.
B005M2A4D4|1.0|The episodes are good, but the PACKAGING STINKS!  Two for two I've sent the series back because of MULTIPLE SCRATCHED DVD's AND DAMAGED DVD HOLDERS.  Stick to the individual boxed portions of this series & you're lees likely to run into this issue!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Let the Great World Spin is one of my all time favorite books.<br />McCann has a way of drawing the reader in, and you don't want to leave.<br />I remember the day that Philipe Petit walked across the wire, and I love the way<br />events in the story were woven around on that day, bringing it all together.<br />Beautiful writing!<br />Terrific story!
6303201245|4.0|This is one of those movies that even though you have seen it before,<br />a couple of times, it is worthy of watching it again. Very well done<br />musically as well as fine acting.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I was very happy overall with this product.  This is a great movie  and i especially enjoyed all the fun stuff that came with this like the book with pictures of the making of the movie and the real family.  Great product!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A character-driven story that comes close to blowing it with incredulity.  However, a fun read. Jack \\"Reacher\\" Reacher is a man's man who can be surprisingly vulnerable around the woman he plays off.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is an awesome game! Some of the puzzles actually make you think! It is nice to have a challenging game...finally!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i looove this app, it is easy to use and helps me to remember to read my Bible daily.  just picked a reading plan, then liked it so much i picked two more plans. am reading my Bible daily now!!!!
B007H51DQG|4.0|Sorry Dale but you can't have your humanity and expect to be alive in a zombie outbreak...Since episode 7 the show has pick up some speed and have all these twist and turns.  But I think Rick needs to step back because he is making some serious bad decisions and getting the group in more deep trouble than he realize.  Now with the death of Dale, there is no voice of reason anymore.  Maybe T-Dog can step into his role? I will be watching the next 2 episodes and Season 3 coming this fall.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the best game ever!!!!!  it is so fun and addicting. there is so many different episodes that are amazing. love it!

B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham always delivers a great story, with courtroom underdogs and down-trodden clients. This one includes some surprising characters that make it a must-read!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is an awesome case for the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />It's light and solid, it has a nice feel thanks to the rubberized shell, it provides great protection against shocks and scratches, it doubles as a simple stand, and it's relatively inexpensive. The elastic band is a nice touch, too (I wish my Kindle Touch case had one).<br /><br />Buy this case. You won't be disappointed.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This product was a surprise gift for my spouse.  It was truly everything I expected in both quality, price, and delivery time.  I would gladly recommend this product to anyone!

B007HNFP62|5.0|Wow!  An incredible must see show!  Finally a dynamic top quality script with all the bells and whistles geared towards adults.  The underlayment of Marilyn's life is captured through intertwining scenes while the real Marilyn pulses through every character.  A delight to view.  I hope this show continues and look forward to the next episode!
B005VTS4EY|4.0|I like this game it's fun . Nothing masterful,  but quirky fun. Kids could do well with it I'm sure. As I said you don't to be a brain surgen to play it, just simple fun.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|Love this book, it is better written than the first one that came out. It makes the diet easier to understand and follow. Not that the diet is hard to do. I have lost over 30lbs. and have energy to burn. Love the information in this book and would recommend this diet to anyone who wants to lose without hunger. Don't believe me, try it. Give it 2 weeks and you will see. I have tried just about every diet out there and this is the first and only diet I have tried that does not leave me hungry and tired.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty decent game considering its free. The ad pop ups can get annoying but otherwise not bad. Good variety of games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion pretty much has all the versions you'd care to use.  I really like the ability to bookmark and highlight passages.  This app also provides various Bible study guides to help kee up your reading each day.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I've come to the Bible fairly late in life, and it's not easy to understand.  Joyce Meyer really brings the lessons to life.  I don't think I could do this without the help of her daily readings.  Thanks!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it because it is only 1 game but it has 101+20 games in it so that is why I like it so so so so so do so so much.
1451626657|5.0|I picked this one up because I wanted something funny to read. It became my favorite book of all time.<br /><br />It's hilarious, exciting, entertaining, touching, and ultimately sad in some parts. Nothing's quite like it, and everyone should read it. I won't go into details about the plot to avoid spoiling anything.<br /><br />I doubt this is even necessary, but I do feel that I need to warn some readers that this isn't a book for kids. It's about war and the army, and nothing is spared- death scenes, of which there are plenty, are gruesome and tragic. Prostitutes and loose women are extremely common topics. Lastly, war profiteering and betraying your own country in war for profit makes up a large part of the plot. This is all to say- 16+ at least. I read it when I was 18.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Excellent movie. It's sad that this film is not getting all the credit it deserves because of the controversy of its message. I watched Anonymous with a completely open mind and a desire to be entertained, and I was not let down in the least. The acting was superb--Rhys Ifans was absolutely stunning as Edward de Vere, capturing so well his passion and pain as the real author (according to the story) of Shakespeare's works. I thought Sebastian Armesto did a fabulous job as well as the tortured Ben Jonson who must keep quiet about de Vere's identity. Movies should not be rated by whether or not a person agrees with the message the filmmakers were trying to communicate--they should be rated on the acting, the script, the cinematography, and the overall quality of the film. Anonymous excels in all areas. It is a fascinating and intricate story, beautifully told. If you like to watch movies of really great stories, then you will love this film.
B006UKFFE0|3.0|Every startup has it's good and bad days. Question is, what to do, when you find that your initial idea is not quite as good as you expected it to be.<br /><br />Ash tries to answer this question by providing clean path to the success. By describing various aspects of running project he will show you issues that are particularly worth addressing. I have to admit that Ash provides you with lots of valuable information regarding issues you will probably encounter during project.<br /><br />Generally, problem with this kind of books is that evaluating provided solutions is very hard. You can't definitely tell that solution will work for you as well. In \\"Running Lean\\" you go through various aspects of running business with CloudFire project in a background - serving as example. Question is whether solutions good for CloudFire will be good for you?<br /><br />One thing I definitely found interesting in the book was Lean canvas - variation on a Business Model Canvas. Comparing to Business Model Canvas it better fits small projects. In fact, Lean canvas can be applied not only to a whole project but to a single task as well. This is quite convenient if you want to describe the tasks before proceeding with solving it.<br /><br />In general, I think this book addresses some general issues but covers topic too much narrow. It is hard to tell how it fits into general concepts of running projects if you don't have any other sources related to the topic at your bookshelf.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Works great on the XOOM. You could easily get through all 100 levels in a sitting, but there are a few confusing levels. Might be too hard for very young kids and some adults lol
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I came here to order another DVD as I have my first I kept from redbox... and its clean and I know how to look for that, but it hesitates and stops then skips ahead. So I will order it again. I am 53 yrs old and my father passed in 2008. He was and probably still is a Marine in heart wherever he is... heaven and in peace. I read some of the reviews. I can see why we can't elect a good president or get away from the very poor educators and the lack of understanding is here in the population of America. Ignorant weak idiot people.<br />OK... I said where I am coming from... my father was trained at Pendleton I was born nearby and lived on base, and my Grandson 3 now was born on base... when the hell are you people going to be smart before you talk? Know what you are saying? Sure this is a little or a lot hollywood... but the principle, do you know what principles are anymore? The principle is true! These men and women will go this far and do the beyond to achieve. They don't quit. They don't run away... unlike other ground forces in the military.<br />So... Dad was of the first battalon- first Marines in Korea... nobody knows what that means right? Well look uo WWII in the Pacific or the CHOSIN RESEVOIR in KOREA thousands went in a few hundred came out.<br />The film is hollywood the 'spirit' of the USMC is absolutely correct and spot on.<br />So you fat popcorn self-indulging aholes here in American with your less than clever false posturing opinions... remember WHY you are safe - those guys - the ones portrayed are REAL and they die so you can live. Wake UP America!
B005SAP45I|4.0|This movie was cute.  It was good entertainment for children with a positive message.  I teach preschool, and from the way my students talked about the movie, I'd say that it was a hit.
1932100385|5.0|A college chemistry professor of mine highly recommended I read this book to me when he found out that I was studying to be a nutritionist & dietician. I now understand why. This is an amazing book that brings the research and facts to the table. This is not a book for those of you who are stubborn and closed-minded because this book will most likely contradict a lot of what you think is true about health and nutrition. However, if you are someone who is in search of the truth, this is your book. This book contains invaluable information that could not only improve and save millions of lives all over the world (especially in the United States).
B002MQYOFW|2.0|There was so much hype for this novel, it couldn't possibly live up to, and it didn't. I found the writing very sloppy and the plot loose, with some pretty shaky characterizations thrown into the mix to give it that real sloppy joe flavour. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if the themes and ideas hadn't been done so much better by Stephen King in \\"The Long Walk,\\" and \\"The Running Man.\\"<br /><br />But, if it will keep your kids reading, I suppose it's worth it. Just don't ask to read it after they're done with it.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This game definitely teaches patience to all who play. Some of the buildings were a bit difficult to build without toppling over, but all in all the child is happy, and that's what counts :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are good, others not so much. you need to earn or buy credits to unlock other games. not terrible for a free app.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|This is a funny movie with a great cast. Be prepared for a bit of crude humor, but lots of laughs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was probably the best one I've ever read. It's that good.  Starts out a little slow, but as soon as the Games start, you're hooked and you won't be able to put the book down.  I can't wait to read the next book, which I've already ordered because the end leaves you hanging. All in all, amazing  book worth reading.
B002GNTDTI|5.0|ignore the guy who reviewed this based on the price, it's worth the money. The story is about superman as a teenager before he takes up the mantle of superman.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|I found this game to be a lot of fun, with a novel concept and puzzles that were challenging enough to be engaging, but never hard enough to be frustrating. My one complaint is that the included 100 levels were only enough to keep me busy for an hour or two.<br />Definitely worth the price, but I'm reserving the fifth star until we get some new puzzles.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great story of a genius of our times. Well written, superb history of the creation of futuristic (at the time) technology products and the driven \\"crazy man\\" who created them. A must read for all who use the Apple hardware and software.

B001IF252M|5.0|I absolutely hate how Apple forces their proprietary output ports on their customers. It's daylight robbery to be charging these prices for an adapter in the absence of a generic market. These things cost something like 2 cents to make!!<br /><br />That said, that issue is outside the scope of this review. This adapter works fine for my 13inch MacBook Air bought in Dec 2011. Hooks up with projectors and external displays as needed and has never fallen out or glitched. I hate having to carry one around, but like I said, outside the scope of this review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good games. they are entertaining and addicting.  these are a must have for people who like a variety of simple.fun games.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I will say first off, that these books should be for the older side of the young adult genre. The Hunger Games start with a ferocious intensity that does not stop throughout the series. Through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, we see the bleak world of the future. A future where an all powerful Capital lead by President Snow forces what is left of the United States(divided into 12 districts) to send one boy and one girl between 12 and 18 from each district into a horrific arena. An arena full of deadly surprises where the children must fight each other to the death live on television.<br />We watch as Katniss volunteers when her beloved sister's name is called as one who will go into the arena, is prettied up for the nationally televised games, struggles with her affections towards fellow team mate Peeta and her best friend Gale back home, her struggle to return home to her family, her ultimate defiance against the Capital and her internal healing after being forced to kill and survive in the arena.<br />The second book is about Katniss's choice to be the flame that starts the rebellion in all 12 districts and the horror of being forced to compete a second time in The Hunger Games deadly Quarter Quell tournament. As I was reading Catching Fire, it was hard not to be engrossed and even awed by how intricately planned out these games are.  It was not a repeat of the first book.  It definitely held its own.<br />The last book, Mockingjay, delves deep into Katniss's mental and emotional state(she seems to be modeled after a POW or war veteran, which I suppose, is exactly what she is.) as they go further into the war between the rebels and the Capital. Katniss is again used as a pawn in these wars just as she was in the Hunger Games themselves...leaving you to wonder if Katniss will ever in her mind, heart or spirit ever truly leave the arena?<br /><br />I loved each book.  They flowed seamlessly into one another and I could not put them down until I had finished them all.I will recommend them to everyone I know.

0385534639|5.0|I honestly have no idea how to start this review... I'm still a bit in awe of The Night Circus. Morgenstern's debut is one that I picked up based solely on recommendations and reviews, as I'd never heard of it before blog posts and blurbs started popping up. I'm really not sure I even read the description prior to deciding to buy it. Still, it sat gathering dust on my bookshelf for about six months before I found the time to sit down and read it... and  immediately begin silently berating myself for letting it sit unread for so long!<br /><br />I was 30 pages in when I realized just how amazingly well-written and fantastical The Night Circus was going to be. I think I knew, even early on, that this novel would become one of my all-time favorites. It's been quite awhile since there has been a story that comes close to rivaling my long time favorite, Jellicoe Road by Melina Marchetta, but The Night Circus came close to causing an upset. Both novels feature a plot that slowly builds in intensity, a gorgeous love story, and wonderful secondary characters.<br /><br />I think it's the secondary characters that have the biggest impact on my opinion of these novels. Comparably, it isn't that difficult to write a lovable main character or romantic interest, but it takes skill to write a troupe of three-dimensional characters, each with their own unforgettable traits.<br /><br />I've always found the circus to be a rather magical place and this idea has only been reinforced by The Night Circus. I really can't even express how much I adored Morgenstern's descriptions of the various circus tents... I wanted to lose myself in those descriptions forever. It was almost like the Harry Potter effect, in which the reader finds herself wishing and wishing that her own letter would arrive inviting her to study at the infamous Hogwarts and she'd promptly be whisked away to a castle with moving staircases and secret passages. If this magial place was real, I think I'd run away to join the circus.<br /><br />I truly don't have words to describe how deeply moved I was by The Night Circus and how very highly I recommend it. Read this book... you won't regret it!e circus.<br /><br />I truly don't have words to describe how deeply moved I was by The Night Circus and how very highly I recommend it.

0062082353|1.0|This book was poorly written and the protagonist is the least likeable one I have come across in a long time. I knew I was going to dislike this guy as soon as I read how he put country before his family! who the heck does that?! nothing comes before my family. The guy is also an immature thug. what grown man goes around getting in bar fights? like I said, the least likeable person I have read about in a very long time. This is all mixed in with the fact that they guy likes killing people and thinks it is fun and easy. I am angry I paid for this book let alone paid too much for it! I will be avoiding this publisher like the plague from now on. utter rubbish. If you want to read a real good book on Iraq Sniping, please read \\"Sniper One\\", that is an incredible book and makes this one look like it was written by a 12 year old.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Heavy lies the crown on Bruce Springsteen's head. Alone among his generation or any subsequent generation, actually he has shouldered the burden of telling the stories of the downtrodden in the new millennium, a class whose numbers increase by the year, a fact that weighs on Springsteen throughout 2012's Wrecking Ball

1612130283|4.0|While listening to the \\"TODAY\\" show, Ann Curry mentioned a teaser intro for the upcoming interview, with \\"The #1 Bestseller book that has wives everywhere talking, Fifty Shades of Grey...  Unfortunately, I had to leave for work before the interview came on, but having just finished the last book on my Kindle, I decided to just download this bestseller.<br /><br />I began reading and was somewhat shocked at the byline - as I would never have bought a book that was so.... well... blushingly detailed.  The story quickly grabbed me and kept me turning, page after page, one blushing interlude to the next.  I was somewhat shocked and deliciously inspired, much to my husbands delight.<br /><br />The second book in the series, Fifty Shades Darker, really begins to tell more of the actual story line. I have very much enjoyed the second book, which really develops the characters and begins to explain what lead to the main character, Christian Grey's complex personality.  In fact, you quite come to have compassion for him and begin to fall in love with his inner personality that he keeps so guarded, and rooting for Ana to continue to pull him into the light where love and joy is found.
B00338QENI|5.0|One of those books every person should read, yet will probably be unknown by most.  I was amazed that I have lived so long and not heard of this lady and the contribution she and her doctors made to the world.  Even more so, that not one of my doctor friends have heard of her.  It is riveting. Medical/ legal ethics, historical insight of racism in our country, amazing medical discovery, family courage, hope for future discovery, it has it all.  My wife died of MSA, and I pray someday she might live on through her brain cells which she wanted frozen to perhaps help someone in the future.  It worked for Henrietta, and she didn't even volunteer.
B001PILRGC|5.0|From the beginning of the Stargate series through all series, seasons, episodes and permutations, it was a SciFi junkie's Disneyland.  If only they would start it up again as this final episode ended.  This was a great finale only to be followed with SG Universe which was a major SciFi disappointment in my opinion.  It appears to be pandering to the soap opera / reality show entertainment of the day and lost all of the imaginative abandon of good science fiction.  Maybe one day we will hopefully pick up with the same mind set and imaginative fun that this episode ended with.  Leave Stargate Universe for those who need to pry into everyone's personal baggage and privacy \\"all the time\\" instead of just having some good, wild-imagination adventures; that's what science fiction is all about - Congratulations to all the SG1 and SG Atlantis crew and writers, you are among the best and are missed!
B0025UHKNS|1.0|It wouldn't allow me to follow the step-by-step instructions in the Quick Start manual. (It wouldn't respond.)

I went to the Garmin support site. It didn't respond to anything suggested there. So, I returned it.

B00005AQF7|5.0|Continuing the heavily instrumental, hedonistic celebration of Dr. Dre's The Chronic, Doggystyle became the perfected, stylistically superior achievement of the Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg partnership. Dr. Dre had finally found the ideal representative of his g-funk production, having in Snoop a uniquely talented and iconic deliverer. Snoop's delivery is as equally laid back as gritty, capable of pulling off a seemingly careless showmanship of moody, versatile verses in an irreverent gangster thematic.<br /><br />While Snoop makes the personality of the verses, it is Dr. Dre who steals the show with his high end production techniques. Dre was able to lay out the lyrical delivery in a silver plate of multiple, harmonic synthesizer/organ melodies with a boastful rhythm section, incorporating a unique savvy of low-end heavy bass and drum loops, trademarks of his production style. Whereas Dre is conveying captivating party starters (\\"G-funk Intro\\"), tetric celebrations of counter morals (\\"Serial Killa\\") or funk inflicted smoothness (\\"It Ain't No Fun\\"), Dre adapts his instrumental input to fit the mood to perfection.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Gin & Juice\\" and \\"Murder Was The Case\\" are staples of not only Snoop's career but also rap in general, while the all star string of Death Row collaborators (Daz, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, Lady Of Rage, RBX) are also relevant, if not occasionally stellar, contributors. One of the 3 absolutely essential releases from the Death Row label.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Summary:<br />In this final novel of the Fifty Shades Series, Christian and Anastasia are trying to settle into their life together. They are deeply, passionately, and crazy in love! New sets of challenges come their way as Ana tries to establish herself into Christian's luxurious lifestyle. Christian's past continues to haunt the couple and more secrets are revealed forcing Ana to make some difficult decisions.<br /><br />My Take:<br />Ahhhhh....How I adore my Fifty! I was so sad to see their story end. I could keep reading about Christian and Ana always! I love how the story begins. I was worried we would miss out on some events leading up to where the novel starts, but E.L. doesn't disappoint! We get to see the whole story from where we left off in Darker.<br /><br />I continue to love Ana and adore how she has grown throughout the series. She's a strong, independent woman, who has the ability to love unconditionally. Christian *sigh* is still wonderful, dominating *wink*, and sinfully tasty!<br /><br />One thing about this series that I haven't mentioned before is that the dialogue between Ana and Christian is hysterical!!! I love \\"Laters, baby!\\" and \\"We aim to please.\\" Also, make sure you read their emails in detail. It's easy to miss some of the little things, so keep your eye out!<br /><br />I love how the story wraps. I'm a big fan of epilogues. I feel an intense need to know what happens after and when life settles in, etc. I cried happy and sad tears. I laughed out loud. I blushed A LOT! I had thoughts of \\"Hmmm...that might not be so bad!\\" Most importantly, (if you can't tell by now) I fell in love with Christian and Ana! What a ride it's been! Thank you and BRAVO E.L.! Most eagerly anticipating your next adventure!<br />[...]

B007CKB2AS|3.0|\\"The record basically started out as folk music - just me and a guitar singing these songs,\\" Springsteen told Rolling Stone in 2012. \\"Then Ron [Aniello] brought a large library of sound that allowed me to explore - like maybe a hip-hop drum loop or country-blues stomp loop.

0374275637|4.0|Kahneman has written a very readable book about the way people think and react to<br />various stimuli, touching on phenomena such as priming, seeing pattern in randomness.<br />Kahneman puts a lot of focus on the 'illogical' choices that people often spontaneously make, although I did not find this to be<br />the most interesting part of the book. First of all some of these choices seems to me not so<br />illogical as he does. One exampel he writes about is that most people prefer buying \\"4 plates, $40 in total.\\"<br />to \\"8 plates, of which 2 broken. $40 in total\\". In Kahneman's world this<br />is illogical as you get more whole plates for the same money in the second deal.<br />But to me its not illogical at all, as the information that 2 of 8 plates have broken in the second<br />set signals that these plates may be fragile and of poor quality. There are many more such instances<br />where I'm left wondering why Kahneman does not see the way most people would reason.<br /><br />I fint the most interesting conclusion in the research conducted by Kahneman to be the way people<br />judge risk under different circumstances. When faced with only bad options, people tend to make risky<br />choices (the make extreme gambles to avoid any of the negative outcomes). These results go a long way to<br />explaining the behaviour of people put into very bad situations.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle has a story telling style that not only brings you along on his long strange trip from the farm to the front lines and ultimately to his being confirmed as America's Number One Sniper with more enemy confirmed kills than anyone else in our history.  You not only feel like you're there with Chris, but you also feel like you want Chris as your friend and would do whatever it takes to earn his respect. A fantastic story that will have you cheering and smiling for one of America's real warriors.  I won't call him a hero, as I'm sure Chris would reserve that title for those who died paying the ultimate price, and which is clear by the end of the book, that Chris would gladly pay that price at any time to protect others he doesn't even know, let alone his own Seal Team buddies.  A must read if you are an American !
0307719219|5.0|\\"Why Nations Fail\\" by D. Acemoglu & J. Robinson (2012).  This book is very valuable in exposing how governments have created various monopolistic businesses to enrich those in favor with their government.  I believe that the first two chapters are rather disjointed in their presentation of the authors' contentions.  The authors seem to make small minor points regarding several countries and then try to prove their contentions far too early in their discussions.  I believe this book would have flowed better had they outlined their contentions more clearly and succinctly in the first chapter, then devote a separate chapter for each country they were discussing, and then conclude.  It just seemed that they would present a few brief contentions, then bring in half-developed monopoly examples, all of which left a disjointed presentation.  Another shortcoming was that they lumped all types of \\"monopolies\\" together without carefully explaining how various monopolies develop: political versus natural.  The authors critiqued the 1900s U.S. \\"Robber Baron\\" monopolies without detailing how they were created: did these businesses provide lower priced goods to obtain market share, or did they collude with various governments in obtaining special legislation that prevented competitors from offering lower prices?  This book detailed the foibles of government-sponsored monopolies, it does not address the issues of government `over' indebtedness, nor how government 'tax breaks' are like mini-monopolies in favoring some (uncompetitive)businesses over others; nor currency (fiat) inflation [okay, one with Zimbabwe].  (See also: \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor\\" by D. Landes; and \\"The Unbound Prometheus\\"  by D. Landes; \\"Decline of Muslim States and Societies\\" by M. Islam; \\"The Closing of the Muslim Mind\\" by R. Reilly; and \\"The Book That Made Your World\\" by V. Mangalwadi.)

B005OCFHHK|3.0|Got this for my oldest son for Christmas. Everything was great except for one chapter in the Order of the Phoenix. It skipped like crazy, which made no sense seeing as how it had never been out of the case. There weren't any scratches or smudges on the disc, so I'm leaning toward bad encoding on the disc itself. Not too happy about that fact.
B0028OF7TA|4.0|\\"The Collection\\" is the compilation of Michael Jackson's solo albums \\"Off The Wall\\" (1979), \\"Thriller\\" (1982), \\"Bad\\" (1987), \\"Dangerous\\" (1991) and \\"Invincible\\" (2001). The first 4 are the special editions released in 2001 with bonus material that includes new tracks, demo versions and interviews with producer Quincy Jones. The discs come in paper sleeves that resemble old LP vinyl covers housed in a clamshell box. Very collectible item. Recommended for every fan and everyone who doesn't have all the albums yet.

B0007YN74A|5.0|We got this book passed down to us by a friend.  My daughter (now 3) has loved it since she was two.  We have the full version, not the board book.  The story is charming and I love the counting.  My daughter often picks it to be read to her.  She loved the drawings, charming rhymes, counting.  She loved the scene where they crash into the apple cart.  A great book.

0756991145|5.0|Every once and a while a book will come along that affects you in a profound and moving way. I believe Mister Pip is one of those books.<br /><br />There was something really lovely about this novel. Mr. Jones managed to take a horrific situation - a civil war - and turn it into something beautiful and sensitive. There is a real feeling of humanity in the way he describes the characters and their lives. Despite all of the horror and sadness going on around the families, the focus is on the relationships between Mathilda and her mother, Matilda and her absent father, and Mathilda and her teacher.<br /><br />As Mathilda learns more about the outside world, she discovers ways to escape her surroundings. As per the title of the book, she does this through exploring the world of Charles Dickens Great Expectations and the world of Pip. Through Pip, Matilda discovers how to live and explore. Pip helps her death with the death and sadness around her - he becomes more than just a character, he becomes an integral part of her being.<br /><br />Eventually Mathilda leaves her world to discover another. However, she always carries with her the lessons she learned from Mister Pip and her old teacher back on the island. As a life-long lover of books, I can relate to how Mathilda clings to this character throughout her life. Even though her feelings towards Mr. Dickens and Pip change a bit as she grows, they are still this anchor to her childhood on the island.<br /><br />This may be one of the best books I've read in awhile. Now, I know I say that a lot, but I've been on a really good reading streak lately (in terms of quality, not quantity). This is one book though that I immediately added to my collection, and which I will probably return to in a few years fondly, lovingly. It really was quite amazing.

0307594009|5.0|It is unnecessary to describe the plot - everyone knows what happened to the young girl and her family. Instead, I will briefly describe the brilliance and highly emotional writing of the young Anne Frank.<br /><br />She grew up in the Secret Annex at  very difficult time for any adolescent. She was hormonal and emotionally dynamic - just starting to challenge authority and discover love. Had she been allowed to live in the outside world, it would have been fascinating to see what type of women she grew into. Sadly, she was forced to mature inside a few very small and silent walls which made every movement and emotion heightened. She was remarkably insightful given her age and had a wonderful ability to describe her surroundings.<br /><br />While you will probably cry at the end like I did, this is certainly something that everyone should read. Out of all the books and memoirs I have read about war and terror, this one struck me a bit more than most. Perhaps it is the realization that this would have been one remarkable women, but she was killed solely because of her religious beliefs. Anne Frank's Diary embodies - for me - the phrase 'Lest we Forget' better than anything else I have ever read.
B001U887VU|1.0|Over the years, especially while living on a boat, crocs were the perfect shoe....Now a landlubber, [[ASIN:B001U889YK crocs Unisex Blitzen Polar Fleece Clog]]I still wear them nearly every day and can walk forever in them, the support is perfect for me.  But these Blitzen were a big disappointment, the cut was wrong, the toe was wrong, the 'spring' in them was wrong...somehow they did not even feel like crocs, but cheap knock-offs, although they had the crocs label on them.....sadly I returned them...big disappointment. Most I can say is they looked great in the box!!!!<br /><br />Several months ago I purchased two other crocs from Amazon and kept one pair since I had worn them (and they gather dust in my closet) and returned the other...same thing, they were stiff and just not like the earlier comfortable make of crocs....whatever that company changed, it was not for the best.
0143119680|5.0|I don't read a lot of fantasy, mostly because....well....they can be so farfetched and unrealistic that I get bothered. There are exceptions to every rule though, and I never fail to hope that a good witch story will draw me in. A Discovery of Witches was that long hoped for book!<br /><br />This was - at heart - partly fantasy and partly romance. This novel was so much more than simply one genre or another. If I can be so bold, I would compare it in some aspects to the Harry Potter series. I'm not saying there was a parallel in terms of content per se, however both featured a highly imaginative and detailed world which they create throughout the novel.<br /><br />Granted, A Discovery of Witches does not draw so much upon a new scenery, however in terms of information it gets full marks. Ms. Harkness develops new world rules using science and philosophy to explain witches, warlocks, vampires, and such. I didn't feel like I was reading fantasy so much as fiction. Let me explain. Fantasy requires the drawing of a imaginary world apart from our own. However, the characters and situations in A Discovery of Witches didn't feel like they were part of another world, they felt like your next door neighbour. Other than the whole vampire thing of course.<br /><br />I was also drawn into the secret of the novel. I was utterly terrified that questions wouldn't be answered, and, alas, my fears were founded. When I did a quick google after finishing the novel, I discovered that this is the first of a trilogy. I will be waiting on pins and needles until the sequel comes out. At the end of this first novel, all I wanted was to devour more, which is a herculean task considering the length of the tome!<br /><br />So, I cannot recommend this book highly enough! It was entrancing and exciting!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it!!!!! I lie how when you win the cards do a victory dance. This game is perfect when I'm traveling.
0552998486|5.0|I think most people have seen the movie version of Chocolat with Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche. Although that is one of my favourite movies, I actually think I much prefer the book which it was based upon.<br /><br />There is something really beautiful about the way Ms. Harris writes. Every phrase is lyrical and enticing. I love how her fiction creates a perfect balance between fiction and magic. When I say magic though, I don't mean magic like Harry Potter, but like the excitement of growing your own herbs, seeing a beautiful sunrise, or listening to the wind in the cliffs. She writes about the magic underlying everyday life, with a bit more thrown in of course.<br /><br />I assume most know the plot of the novel. A young single mother and her daughter move to a oppressive french village where they open a chocolate shop. The local priest tries to get rid of them as they inspire liberty and freedom amongst the villagers.<br /><br />The biggest difference between the novel and movie is the protagonist. In the movie, the bad guy is a local aristocrat instead of the local priest. The change makes sense though as the movie doesn't place as strong an influence on religion as the novel. Regardless, they both serve their purpose and play the role in a similar way in each medium. The familial relationship is better explored in the novel version as well, in particular Vivianne's background with her own mother. I do feel that this added a level to her character that the movie lacked. Nonetheless, both are incredible!<br /><br />I cannot recommend this novel more highly. I have read it a half a dozen times, and love it a little more each time. I also love the sequel The Lollipop Shoes, where we re-encounter the family living in Paris.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didnt have any idea what the story was, as I got into it, but I am so glad that I did. It is such a touching story. I am already almost through Catching Fire now.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This is one of the most fantastic books I have read in a long time - even if I have no idea how to categorize it. Some might call the book a mystery, which works as there is certainly a mystery within the story. Others might call it a thriller, which also works as there is plenty of subtle drama to keep the reader fascinated.<br /><br />At the end of the day though, I don't care what category you place this book in. I simply think it is incredible.<br /><br />It is tough to give a description of this novel without giving too much of the plot away, but it starts with an aging famous writer engaging a sad young women to write her memoir - her thirteenth tale. The writer had been notoriously private throughout her career but was willing it seems on her deathbed to reveal who she really was.<br /><br />There are many sad and tragic twists to the writers life, including a few rather large ones in the end which will have you skimming back through the entire book again determined to find a clue you might have missed. I really wish I could say more than that, but I truly would rather other people read it for themselves.<br /><br />This is actually the second time I have read this book. I first read the book shortly after it was released, and adored it. I have to say though that I got just as much enjoyment - if not more - from the second reading than I did the first. This time I was able to scour each and every conversation to find hints of the surprise ending, though found very few. The author does a remarkable job of surprising the reader with her conclusion. So I say, read this book! Assuming you haven't already.

0553801473|3.0|I just finished this book tonight. When it started it was a chore to read, but in the second half the pace really picks up.<br /><br />The first half backs up to have the same time line as the previous book, but from the viewpoint of characters not covered in that volume. Perhaps necessary, but the read felt very dry.<br /><br />I felt the second half did more to advance the story line, and brought many of the the characters (but not all) I was curious about from the previous volume back in to the action, and there were even a few surprises. I sincerely hope that the next volume picks up as fast as this one left off. As a previous reviewer noted, by this time in the story, the plot should be advancing at a faster pace.
B001HN6922|5.0|I enjoyed it even if the world didn't.  I thought it was just as enjoyable as the first.  Racing enthusiasts may have a few problems with the logistics.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a Hollywood adaptation of Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's mystery novel. The film, of which story is dark and often violent, is directed by David Fincher, who is known for such thriller as \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Zodiac.\\"<br /><br />The film is about a Swedish journalist and co-owner of the magazine \\"Millennium\\" Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who, after losing a libel case brought against him, sets out to investigate what happened to Harriet Vanger, grandniece of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a retired CEO of a family industry, when she suddenly went missing about 40 years ago.<br /><br />To do so, he enlists a help from a genius computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), who has gone through terrible experiences as you will see in the film. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is more about the luridness of the truths than the process of finding them out, and about the characters who can be very brutal without remorse.<br /><br />Considering the subject matter, David Fincher is the right choice for making an English-speaking version, though it seems as if the director has lost interest in the film's final 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />Some nay find the film's English-speaking characters (played by the international cast) in the Swedish setting a bit strange. But perhaps the film would have looked stranger had its story been set in somewhere in America. After all remaking a film is not copying the original, but changing it, so something must go.<br /><br />With Jeff Cronenweth's effective photography, Fincher's version looks more polished than the Swedish counterpart, though I don't know if it is really a good thing. The 158 minute film is most notable for Rooney Mara's strong acting and director's skills that keep the sinister feeling going on in the film's world.

B007CKB2AS|3.0|First of all, Bruce is indeed taking care of his own.  Especially that 1 per cent at Columbia by charging a good 3 bucks more for his MP3s, than about 99 per cent of the new releases out there.  Think about it.  His anger and passion for the plight of America comes at 12.99 with digital booklet.<br /><br />It's a more listenable effort than he's had since the early 90s.  The opening track is the lamest and most hard to swallow really but the rest has an early Springsteen attempt at solid anthems and heartfelt slow tempo my hearts breakin and the Lord's gonna save us quality that seems fairly listenable, throw in some Irish influence, and it is a fairly good effort for his tried and true, Bruce is a prophet crowd of 'believers'. (And the last song does indeed sound like the Dropkick Murphys-if they were in wheelchairs...)<br /><br />I'm sorry folks, I just have trouble swallowing his authenticity.  His whole desire to be the anthemic voice of Americana just doesn't ring at the decible I'm hearing.  I just got Jay Farrar's Multitudes written with Woody's lyrics, and the music, the authenticity, everything is there for me, here in working class Middle America.  Authenticity without the looking down with my country accent darlin Lordy cliches.<br /><br />And I know I'll get those NO clicks but really?  12.99 vs 8.99 or 9.99 like the other 99 per cent?  And those reviews where they say it's music you just don't hear anymore?  Yall need to musically get out more.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I debated wether I should watch this or not as I was afraid it would ruin the magic of the books for me (the first three anyway). But I was pleasantly surprised. The series stayed pleasingly close to the books and when it deviated it usually did so by omission of detail and not by making up new material (I hated that in the LOTR movies).<br /><br />A lot of people seem to complain about the gratuitous sex scenes, it's a sign of our askew view that apparently a naked breast or penis offends people whereas a full frontal beheading appears to be fine. I never got that, why is sex worse then violence? Well there is plenty of both in this series (books and show) and that's just fine with me.<br /><br />Where in my opinion it falls a little short is scenes that show armies or mass events like drogos wedding. The problem is that in the books you read about 10000nds of participants whereas in the show you see a hundred at best in very carefully choreographed and narrow shots. The fastness of the events and/or landscapes isn't captured too well, but that is most likely a concession to budget.<br /><br />All in all, good acting, close adaptation of the book and a good flow through the 10 installments of the show make this a four star series for me...
1466401885|3.0|Good but not great!I felt like it started real slow and I didn't care for the cheesy nickname that Travis gave Abby! I also felt the whole her stealing her fathers gambling luck was a cheesy!! I like the love between them and I really enjoyed the part with Travis and his family! Over all it was good!
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Great game.  I played through the first fifty levels day one.  Some are simple, others require more thought.  Graphics and functionality good on the Kindle Fire.
1612130283|5.0|I have had ADD my whole life and it is very hard for me to read because I am easily distracted and loose interest. I saw a story about these books on The Today Show and I was intrigued. I started Fifty shades of Grey and and 2 days later I had read all three! I was blown away! They held my full attention and I found myself getting upset when everyday life prevented me from being able to read!! I am hoping that E.L James will do the books based on Mr. Grey's side. I am planning on reading all three again. I highly recommend these books!!!
B0059XTUO0|5.0|I went to see this movie mainly because I had heard so much about it - I did not expect to be so completely taken in by a silent movie!  I was fortunate to see it twice in a restored movie house that was actually old enough to have shown silent movies.  They even began some shows with a concert on their restored organ used during the silent movie era.  Anyway, I don't remember the last time I left a movie feeling so good.  What a rare thing these days.  I am looking forward to owning the movie on Blu-ray.
1619491761|3.0|Austen's prose is never less than excellent, but, as a story meant to engage, Mansfield Park falls short. Fanny Price is at the center of an intrigue about family, class, money and marriage that strives to teach us a lesson about the importance of character. There is a Cinderella plot, wherein Fanny is the neglected and often maligned niece living among wealthier and more socially prominent relatives. Her female cousins, Maria and Julia, and her dreaded Aunt Norris, are particularly unloving. As Fanny matures in this environment, she becomes extremely attached to her cousin Edmund, who, in showing a modicum of kindness to Fanny, wins her undying devotion. Edmund, who, as second son, is headed for the clergy, acts as a brother/moral mentor to Fanny. The two of them must become an ethical bulwark against the many evils that begin to swirl around the family with the arrival in Mansfield of the questionable Crawford siblings, Mary and Henry, at the same time that the family patriarch, the only hope for a general guidance towards good behavior, is called away on business. As long as it takes Austen to set up this scenario, the novel does have promise at this point.<br /><br />I won't detail the rest of the plot, as many other reviewers have already done, but I will note that the promise of interest embodied by the ill-fated play and the intrigue-laden trip to Sotherton are never really delivered upon. What eventually drags the novel down is the attenuated beating taken by both Fanny and reader, before we are mercifully led to the (somewhat obvious) conclusion of the story. Fanny's morality seems to be tightly bound up with being humorless, tearful, miserable, physically and verbally weak, and basically a  martyr. For the herione, duty and familial love trump all else, and any shortfall of her ideal is viewed with shock and horror. The immorality of the villains, on the other hand, is associated with wit, playfulness, sexual attractions, and fun, as well as the usual avarice and deception. The sheer dogged, unrelenting goodness, of Fanny especially, starts to feel like a prison, from which others' soulless frolicking looks quite enjoyable. Fanny and Edmund are punished for their stronger characters throughout, until about the last fifty pages of the novel, when all is turned around a bit too quickly, and goodness is rewarded while badness is banished. But the rewards, such as they are, are so perfunctory and late-coming, that they hardly seem worth it.
B002ZG97LK|4.0|This movie is a remake of the 1984 classic film and it is worth watching. There are some changes to the storyline but overall it is very similar. Ren (Kenny Wormald) has to move to Georgia after his mother passes away to live with his uncle and their family. There he meets Ariel (Julianne Hough) who is the wild preacher's daughter and a fire slowly builds between the two as they learn more about each other and their love of dancing.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty true to the original movie but there are a few changes. I won't spoil them for you as you have to watch the movie. My wife and I both liked the remake and the acting was above average. Julianne Hough does a wonderful job as the preacher's daughter and the dance scenes are a lot of fun to watch. Almost all the characters are still in the remake and you will enjoy the goofy county boy Willard (Miles Teller) who steals the dance scene near the end of the movie.<br /><br />If you like the original then you will like this! If you never saw the original then you will still enjoy this as a fun movie to watch!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Seems fine. I do prefer paid games that do not have intrusive menus or pop ups. Otherwise has been entertaining through the first time played.
B005K17RU0|4.0|good app.  Of all the weather apps I prefer AccuWeather.  It doesn't give hour by hour, but otherwise it is a great app.
B006TXDOZ0|4.0|Wow,  awesome album (yes, i said album) as this is good old school blues and rock.  Jack White's projects now have some competition from England.  The fast songs rock hard, and the slow ballads are quite beautiful.  It's rare to hear nice duet harmonizing in rocknroll, and Russell and Emma nail it perfectly.  Navigate is an achingly somber divine song, and Sweet Sour and The Devil Takes Care of His Own, quite simply ROCK!!  And i mean that in the most revering, old school way.  Get this album or disc or mp3 or 8track or cassette or whatever.  Enjoy it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love this game!!  all of u people who keep complaining about not being able to skip levels are stupid.  the whole point is to be challenged and apply physics.  and after a few levels u can skip. btw this is a really addicting game that u could play for hrs and not even notice. luv  this game :D
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is lots of fun.  I can spend hours playing it.  the quest level is the best.  I would highly recommend this game

B005QWJWYC|5.0|I started watching the Vampire Diaries on Netflix and was very happy to find I could watch some episodes on Hulu for free and the ones that were too new I could purchase on Amazon for only $1.99. It is one of the very best vampire series ever. I also love Being Human series about vampires, werewolves, and ghosts (very sexy). If you like Vampire Diaries you will also love Being Human series (I recommend watching it) (The American version. I wasn't so impressed with the UK version). They have the first season on Netflix, some episodes of season two on Hulu for free and the newer season two episodes on Amazon for $1.99. Oh the sexy vampires! Just can't get enough of them. The werewolves aren't so bad either. Excellent eye candy with an interesting story line.
0545123275|3.0|This fast adolescent read mostly held my attention and kept me invested enough to care what happened to the characters.  There were a few twists I didn't see coming which kept the work very original, and I appreciated the unique take on were/shifting lore.  While I would have likely rated it a four star, I found myself often reminiscing other paranormal young adult reads to which I had a much stronger affinity and inclination.  I would likely read another book in this series if it happened across my path, but I don't feel a pressing need to brave the winter cold and snatch it up from a yellow-eyed hottie at a local bookstore.  ;o)
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have several office apps and this is the best.  It is as close to microsoft office as I have found for Android.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book (and audio listen) has it all: friendship, heartache, action, romance, wit, suspense.  I oohed, aahed, winced, cried, got really angry, cheered, booed.  I did it all.  I really didn't think I'd be able to support adolescent characters who are thrown into a brutal, real-life survivor arena with the need to fight to the death, but somehow Katniss, Peeta, Rue and a host of other characters took up residence in my heart.  This book took me by surprise and I'm so glad it lived up to all the hype.  Plus, what's not to love about a strong, self-sufficient, butt-kicking female lead!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With all of the hype I had to try the book and then I found I couldn't put it down!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great looking app. Easy to use interface, and accurate.... Well, it's as accurate as any of the others I guess. It's easy enough to navigate for my

B004J4WNL2|5.0|\\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\" is a study in sociology and psychology on the value that Western culture puts on qualities possessed by extroverts and introverts alike. While I hate to put people into buckets, to categorize them, this is nonetheless a phenomenal book that should be read by all.<br /><br />I am a strong introvert often masquerading as an extrovert in my mid-thirties so I have long since accepted myself and my needs. However, as Susan Cain points out introverts are highly prone to stronger feelings of guilt and this book has helped assuage the guilt that I feel for not wanting to go out as often as my friends and for needing alone time which seems so unacceptable in a society (and city) that puts such a steep value on \\"doing\\". While I have always felt like I could be myself, I feel like I now have permission from the world to do so, especially as a female introvert which seems to be even less acceptable. It also makes sense to me now why I have always felt so misunderstood.<br /><br />Extroverted qualities make sense to us because that is what we are taught to believe one should strive for. I hope that those who possess those highly sought after extroverted qualities and needs will read this book. They may find it easier to understand and accept their more introverted children, parents, siblings, friends, colleagues and acquaintances.<br /><br />The only piece that I wished was expanded upon was the section on when introverts should act like extroverts.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I'm glad I read the reviews before I bought anything.  I spent the extra on the Apple brand, like some others did, and I'm glad I did.  It works fine with no problems.
B006FTCH2E|1.0|boring waste of time. I think the cast and crew wrote all those positive reviews. I picked this. My wife and I watched it together she says I can never give her a hard time about watching all her dumb romantic movies.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|I love this game. I'm only giving it three stars because I think you should be able to skip levels after you've tried them a hundred times! Level 28 sucks! If I don't pass it soon I'm deleting the game, which is a big problem. I don't want a game that stresses me out even more! I like a challenge, but sometimes I want the option to take the easy way out. Can someone tell me how to pass 28?
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its a smooth playing and looks good unlike half the other chess games and besides if that wasn't enough if free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. I played it for hours lol....It almost felt  like playing on the computer. Very easy to work with.
0307277453|5.0|This is a delightful and gripping book. My personal journey from creationist (ex JW - I used to argue creation door to door and even lectured to congregations on it) to sceptic is endorsed by such erudite, evidence based information. True science is revealed in the predictibility of gap filling evolutionary finds. While I have read all the usual Dawkins and others (as good as they are) Shubins really picks a specific model to target and reveals the undeniable evolutionary process. Jaws and ears, gills and lungs all evidence the slow march to current life forms around us today. Initially I found the title off putting for some reason - if it in any way makes you resist this book - don't. Great read - nontechnical but adequately challenging and educational . Get it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app works really well on my Kindle Fire. Cards move nicely . A touch of the finger and the cards move logically
0439023521|5.0|I first heard about this series of books, on a cruise travel board. Everyone was talking about what books they take, or have taken, to read when they cruise. More than half of the poster's were talking about the Hungar Games series. I immediately went to Amazon, to look them up. Once I read the introduction, I had to order all three books. As soon as I started to read the first one, I was completely hooked. Ms Collins is an excellent writer. She really knows how to draw the reader right into the story line, and keep them there. All three books, in this series, are page turners. I read all three, in about 5 days. Then wished I hadn't read them so fast, but you just have to know how it all ends. I won't spoil the ending, by saying anything more. I am so glad I discovered the books, and highly recommend them. I hope Ms Collins writes many more.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|I like the layout, but the app is slow, forgets who I am, and freezes ans force closes. I am not happy with it, but I will wait for updates. I miss google apps. although, if this app worked, I would be pretty pleased with it. //kindle fire and google fan
B004UXUUDA|4.0|A very good film about what happen in France during World War II. History tends to hide what happen to the Jewish people in other countries, not many people realized that the French turned against some of their own people because of their Jewish faith. Kristin Scott Thomas is as usual brilliant in this film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game that lastes...............<br />entertaining to brings alot of old games to the table decently a classic . :) :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great adventure!  A perfect book for a wide range of readers; from adolescent to adult and from book worm to reluctant reader!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it. Lets me pass the time away while I 'm waiting on the kids. Solitary always was my favorite game.
0439023491|4.0|Definitely a page-turner, but as most sequels, not as good as the first.  I do give her credit though, in that she can keep things unpredictable and interesting.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging. It has a TON of levels, and each of them is unique in their own way. A few of them are so hard it takes a long time. But they are so addictive and are very well thought out.<br />Thanks to the people that made this game!!!!!!!!!!! :)
1416550534|5.0|Towards the end of this book, I was moved to tears.  I felt such an affection for Grace.  Loved how the author went back and forth between times...By the last page, I felt like Grace was an old friend.  The writing is elegant and the story engrossing.  If you love things British...you will love this story.  I wasn't ready for the story to end when it did...putting down my kindle I felt a sense of regret.

B00051E906|5.0|I have been worried about the radiation level in Seattle WA after the Fukushima Nukes melt down. The government does not provide any data regarding level of radiation. So I purchased the Radex to protect my family. Radex is very compact and I can carry it anywhere.<br /><br />Today I measured the radiation level at home; It was 0.08-0.13 micro seiverts per hour(sv/h)  at the 2 feet from the floor - I was kind surprised to know how high the level is.  The 0.10 micro seiverts per hour at home means that I will receive 0.876 mili-severts of radiation a year (=0.10 x 24 hour x 365 days /1000). Assuming that it is safe to be exposed to up to 1 msv a year, the radiation level at home should not exceed 0.12 micro sv/h. It is not the level that we have to move to the safer place, but we need to be pay attention to the level of radiation.<br /><br />I also checked the level of radiation outside of the house. It was 0.10-0.20 micro sv/h at the 2 feet from the ground. As expected, the level of radiation was relatively high at the place close to puddles (0.20 micro sv/h), drain outlets (0.14 micro sv/h), and a park ground (0.13 micro sv/h). As we don't stay outside for 24 hours, I don't worry so much. However, parents and pet owners should be careful so that children and pets not be exposed the radiation.<br /><br />It was definitely a good purchase because it gave me peace of mind - I though that the level of radiaiton was much higher here. For professional scientists, Radex might not be as stable as the expensive geiger counters. However, Radex geiger counters do a good job for the people like me. I will keep monitoring the level of radiation with Radex to protect my family.<br /><br />Update - 3/30/3012<br /><br />Since I purchased Radex, I've got the chance to go business trip to Japan. I was scared to go Japan because of Fukushima meltdown. I carried Radex with me.<br /><br />The radiation level in Tokyo is almost twice as high as Seattle. Inside of hotel: 0.13-0.16 microsv/h. Outside: 0.20-0.30 micro sv/h (measured at 2 feet from the ground). I wore a mask all the time during my stay in Tokyo to prevent radioactive hot particles from coming into my throat (i.e., some of scientists detected plutonium, cobalt 60 and cesium, etc in the soil and dust in Tokyo). According to Radex instruction, we can calculate radiation level of food and water. I checked the radiation of the water in the bath tub. It was 0.13 micro sv/h...<br /><br />But, the highest level of Radiation I measured was not in Tokyo - it was on the airplane heading to Narita Airport. The highest point was 2.85 micro sv/h(!!). My Radex started to alarm and kept indicating more than 1.0 micro sv/h for over 5 hours. This means that I was exposed to at least 20 micro sv during my business trip to Japan:( The radiation emitted from Fukushima nukes is drifting in the air away from Japan. Airplanes travel through this air, which is very scary! For comparison, I checked the radiation level in the flight between Seattle to Vancouver - it was just 0.20 micro sv/h. Now I understand the reason why airplane companies try to avoid Narita Airport...<br /><br />Anyway, thanks to Radex, I can calculate how much radiation I will be exposed a year. I am trying to keep exposure to radiation less than 1 mil sv/year.
B0063GORYU|4.0|almosr perfect - easy to use with tablet.Able to start, play and exit when I want which is not true of a lot of android games for tablets.

0307956350|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at \\"The Expats\\". Kate works for the CIA as a spy/killer. After her children were born, she asked for more of a \\"desk job\\" so she wouldn't be putting her life at risk and leaving for long periods of time. She married a boring security system analyst which whom life is good and \\"normal\\". Then, out of the blue, her husband tells her they are moving to Luxomberg to start a new life. He has a new job for a big bank and they will finally have money to spend and have lots more time together as his business trips will be less. She's leary but ultimately agrees. This is a reason for her to quit the CIA. During her exit interview, she has to relive all her past assignments, some of which are not pleasant for her.<br /><br />Once in Luxomburg, she finds life to not be all she thought. Being a \\"mommy\\" and running around to various womans clubs and social coffees is not what she wants. A new childless couple comes into town and become Kate and her husband's new buddies. Their meetings in other the norm places seems by chance but Kate is not convinced it is. Is she paranoid? Is her past catching up with her? Her husband doesn't know about her past life in the CIA and she fears for their lives. She enlists help to uncover who or what their new \\"friends\\" are. She also starts investigating her own husband. She doesn't believe all he's saying (or not saying). His behavior is suspicious and he's gone all the time.<br /><br />What will Kate find out? I don't want to spoil it for you...
B0067Q42BY|5.0|To be honest, when I first downloaded this game I wasn't expecting much.  Yet that being said Mahjong Artifacts has quickly become one of my most played games I have on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I've had some fun played mahjong before on the computer but never really got into it that much.  The beauty of this game is all the small things it does to make the game so fun and accessible.  Visually it looks great, the backgrounds are nice and the pieces are sharp and easy to distinguish.  Some optional features like auto-zoom and the ability to highlight available pieces are extremely helpful.  Then you have the story which is comprised of very simple one page comic stripes, its nothing amazing but it gives the player just enough reason to believe that you are on a quest of sorts.<br /><br />To conclude, this is an excellent app that I believe can be enjoyed by anyone no matter what there level of experience with Mahjong is.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Breaking Dawn was one of my favorite installments.  The movie captured quite a lot of the book.  Bella and Edward's honeymoon was really wonderful to see in the movie version.  The locations were beautiful and matched my vision of the book pretty closely. The turmoil that Bella's decision created was really full of emotion.  Looking forward to Breaking Dawn Part 2.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|With the technology we have today, I'm surprised that they did not use cutting edge technology. Most of the scenes looked fake and unimpressive.  The costume was too funny! I laughed a few times at the God's costume. It looked like they were going to some kind of holloween party LOL!  Videophiles will hate this movie because of the bad black level, and I'm watching this on a calibrated display. I've watched countless movies and this is the only movie I had to adjust my screen's brightness. The scenes were way too dark . It looks like it was made in a cheap studio. Overall I give it a one star for terrible picture quality and bad storyline.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Put this on my Kindle Fire. I really enjoy the games and the challenge to unlock more. However, some cant be played because of the the lagging. Doesn't swipe when swipped.  Cant really complain since it is free but would be a 5 star app if controls worked.

Might be a little much for someone not really into the financial markets but the superb acting in this movie makes up for any confusing lingo.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Is it even possible to comment on this Magnum Opus that capped the classic Pink Floyd lineup? The group was crumbling all around them and they would never be the same again. I believe The Wall is the most fleshed out and cohesive concept album ever conceived. My personal favorite song is Hey You. To me it sums up the album up to that point. Get this album and you're sure to find a favorite.<br /><br />As for the 2011 remaster? To my ears, the improvements over the previous editions are subtle. It was a well recorded and produced piece of work to begin with so improvements wouldn't be drastic.  The Wall is a requirement for even the most casual Floyd fan.

B001KL3GZO|5.0|Is there any more quintessentially jazz album than Kind of Blue by Miles Davis? This timeless album is so archetypal it will still be as relevant 100 years from now as it is today and as it was 50 years ago. If you don't know what jazz is get this album. If you think you don't like jazz, get this album. If you don't \\"get\\" jazz, just get Kind of Blue. You'll be an instant convert.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Based on the books written 100 years ago, this is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. It has an intelligent script with no plot holes, or faulty logic. All the characters motivations make sense.<br /><br />If you're tired of all the \\"popcorn\\" movies like transformers and GI Joe, that put cgi and explosions before things like plot and acting, then go see John Carter. You will care about the characters, and what happens to them.<br /><br />From the director of 2 pixar movies, John Carter is a movie for everyone. I saw this movie with my nephews (6 and 9), my brother and his wife (33 and 32), and my father (60), everyone loved it! My nephews said it was the best movie ever.<br /><br />If you kind of want to see John Carter, GO SEE JOHN CARTER, you'll love it and you can thank me later!<br /><br />Truly an AMAZING movie!!! This is sci fi done right!
006197806X|4.0|Just finished listening to Delerium again so I could remember all the little details of the story.  Such heartbreak at the end when Alex is left behind.  In Pandemonium, Lena forges onward in a story moving back and forth from \\"Then\\" to \\"Now.\\"  It is six months after she enters the Wilds and she battles the elements and sometimes others people in her attempt to survive.  But we also learn of her life as an infiltrator.  She meets a young man, Julian, who is about to get the operation but they end up hiding from government agents together instead.  Will the sweet romance be enough to hold them together?  You know you want to read this book...get yourself to the library or a bookstore and get going!

The faces are soft and show mediocre expressions.<br />I understand its just a more \\"colorful\\" version of the original Rider-Waite deck's painted images so I guess the absense of clarity in the pictures would make sense.  I was just a little disappointed in the lack of definition with the images.  Otherwise it's a great deck!

B001IWV030|2.0|This is pretty awful.  The jokes are all pretty stale and predictable - a regurgitation of some notion of what humor is supposed to be - not the real thing. What's even worse is that it's an all-star cast, so with expectations so high, it has a long way to fall.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Enjoyable. The puzzles weren't too hard, but hard enough to be interesting. Game is very short, the though, with only 100 levels. I played only a couple of times and finished all of them.
B0006213WG|4.0|chuck was the last album to include their amazing guitarist dave \\"brownsound\\". in my opinion he is what made this band so great and unique. because without him, they were just another pop punk band without much to set them apart. daves guitar solo's on this album are killer and the songs in general are much heavier than their earlier stuff. hell, even my metal loving dad loved this album. he probably listened to it more than i did. while i dont think this is sum 41s best album, its definitely one worth checking out. its a great album with a lot of solid tracks.

B000002N2P|4.0|this isnt my favorite green day album by any means but it definitely has some great tracks on it like stuart and the ave. if you're a fan of the \\"nimrod\\" and \\"dookie\\" albums by the band, then this one will definitely be right up your alley. similar style and your typical green day essence all around. definitely worth checking out.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|it is cool but I cant beat level 30 other than that its challenging and wonderful I would recomend it
B000RIHBIE|2.0|this cd was pretty disappointing to me. after 3 amazing albums in a row, the departure of guitarist dave clearly left the band in a pretty bad spot because these songs all sound the same. they arent unique and frankly it could possibly be their worst album all together.
B005HSL626|5.0|I think it is a great game and the thought of it being free is great I think this game should never ever get a one star so whomever gave that as a review should never get to have or play pr eat and fruits. I forbid
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I think it is better than some of the reviews I have seen, but it does wander a little. It jumps from Brienne<br />wandering around looking for Sansa to the power struggle in the Iron islands. If you liked the first three,<br />it is similar,but lt is less focused.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so fun to play even if some of the games aren't the best its fun to play when I'm bored and all my friends love it

B005Q1W10A|5.0|My wife found this series late one night browsing Netflix and instantly fell in love with it.  After watching 3 episodes of season 1 we were both hooked.  We watched it avidly on PBS but wanted the series to have in house.  You wont be disappointed with this one.

B001HN6922|5.0|Get movie sequel.  My grandson, 2, loves Cars.  Watches it over and over.  Holds his attention and entertains him when he can't go outside or is sick.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I bought this because I had heard a lot about it.  The story was absorbing, but very dark.  In fact, at the end of the book, I could not really remember any happy parts in the whole book.  The ending does make you want to find out what happens next, but not enough to wade through more violence and pain for the characters.  Don't think I will continue the series.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I can not stop watching this move it was one of my favorites from the series. I can not wait to see part 2
B0001K9IJ8|5.0|This SACD is definitely worth having if you like Diana Krall - and you probably do if you're reading this! Besides providing lovely background music for a dinner party or just to sit back and enjoy, this SACD provides a beautiful, full and warm (mellow) sound that makes the investment in SACD worth while.
B004LWZW8S|4.0|This was very well done, with a nice artistic spin. The direction and cinematography was done quite nicely too. I enjoyed the fights and the portrayal of the Gods. Overall nicely done.
B0059XTUMC|5.0|All I have to say is- WOW. And this: this movie is filled with surprises that nobody can possibly expect. My friend said that he was surprised that the movie could surprise him. It is (arguably) revolutionary. Breathtaking. It is for ANYBODY to see.. for the artist, the musician, the romanticist... beautiful picture... I will buy it.
B005F9CPG8|3.0|I don't need to say much about the Beatles music.  Everyone who even stops by this page will already have at least somewhat of an understanding of its genius and its lasting power.  What I want to review is the \\"1\\" collection itself, and the new remasters.<br /><br />First off, \\"1\\" is a set of hit singles.  Only the A sides.  I much prefer the 2-CD \\"Past Masters\\" set which has both A and B sides back-to-back.  That leads me to my second gripe.  \\"Past Masters\\" was remastered in 2009 as well.  And since this release of \\"1\\" uses the same masters as the ones in 2009, it is generally useless, since anyone who bought the box set or the individual sets will already have the same versions as here.  And to be honest, I think \\"1\\" was a pointless idea in the first place because you need more to complete the Beatles' story.  I don't even think the \\"1962-66\\" and \\"1967-70\\" sets nail that one, although they are the ones that come the closest.<br /><br />Now, on to the remasters.  I took the time of burning a CD with the original takes and the remastered versions of each song back-to-back and I listened with headphones to really tell the difference.  In many cases, the 2009 versions sound lifeless, in my opinion, which really isn't good for a Beatles record.  The originals had more of a warm feeling to them, whereas the new ones sound cold and dead.<br /><br />I am still giving this three stars just because, after all, it's still The Beatles we're talking about.<br /><br />I would recommend steering away from \\"1\\" and get the original, NOT 2009, version of the two \\"Past Masters\\" CDs for your collection of singles.
1439102732|5.0|I don't believe I can say more than two of the most recent reviews of 'Bibliophile' and 'Kelly' with their well-written insights. This novel evolved because the view points of the three main characters were brought to light in a way that helped see the sides that eventually mattered. Yes maybe the ending was tied together but after everything the characters went through, it seemed fitting enough. I see that 'conservatives' don't like this book and I can't blame them. The only thing that would've balanced this was to have equally avid and militant people on the side of GLAD. This book takes you on a ride like a wave that caught you up and almost drowns you until you come crashing to the shore. I too couldn't put this down. I also admit I did not use the music as an aid in reading this book. I read at different times where this wouldn't have been possible but I don't feel I've missed anything by not listening to it.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|This game is a perfect time waster. It keeps you thinking outside the box. My only complaint is that there is no option to mute/control the volume. Other than that, it's a great puzzle game.

B0071PS7AC|5.0|this app is great.  I found a way to get strikes each time and beat the best computer player.  but anyway there are 5 charactars you can play against and each one is just a different difficultly and betting money maximum.  that probably doesn't make any sense to you if you didn't get this app already.  And for the way to get strikes each time is not putting the ball dead in the center of the alley.  you need to drag ur finger until it is off your phone or kindle (when I say this I mean in floor panels.  there is about 30 panels and the one that is right next to the one that's in the dead center.)  I'm not to sure if that makes any sense but hopefully you do good &#12485;

0525478817|5.0|I absolutely love John Green and just about everything he writes. This book is no exception. I wanted to not rush through and really savor the story, but I plowed through it far too quickly.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I received a copy of The Forever Girl from Rebecca Hamilton by responding to a Tweet and I am so glad I did.  This story follows Sophia Parsons, a practicing Wiccan, which makes her an outsider in the small town she lives in.  She has two close friends, Ivory and Lauren and is a waitress.  She has a constant hissing in her head, which she believes is a family curse. She goes to a club with Ivory one night and her world rapidly changes.  Her ho-hum life will change forever as she meets Charles, a super sexy guy, who happens to be an immortal shapeshifter, and a cast of other intriguing characters as she seeks to learn the truth about her family's history.<br />This is not your typical paranormal book, with just vampires and werewolves.  It delves into the Wiccan world and provides an insightful and interesting story with vampires, witches, and other creatures and how their worlds interact intertwining with the use of elements.<br />I loved the characters.  Sophia is a strong lead female, who has to take on a lot very quickly before she fully understands what she is.  Charles, is sexy, understanding, adds some humor and has been around for centuries.  Therefore, you know there's a lot more to him than just a handsome face.  Just love him! sigh...  I wasn't quite sure what to make of Ivory in the beginning, but you learn more about her later in the book.  Her story is a little heartbreaking, but what happens needs to happen.  I'm sure in the books to come, we will see/learn more of her, as well as Lauren, who had a relatively small part in this book.<br />If you want to learn about Wiccan ways, like vampires, witches and other powerful creatures, this book is for you. I highly recommend it.

1451627289|4.0|At this point in his career, does Stephen King need anyone else to say anything about any of his books?  No, not really.  And yet, in over a decade of writing reviews, I don't think I've ever written about Mr. King.  I feel I want to say something about him.  So, for what it's worth, here it is.<br /><br />Books and writers come and go.  Even writers who make it to \\"the canon\\" go in and out of vogue.  Only time will tell whose books are still being read 100 years from now.  That being said, and despite my natural penchant against prognostication, if I were forced to predict who is most likely to be one of those writers whose books are still read in the future, I would put my money on Stephen King.<br /><br />Let me be clear: Mr. King is not one of my favorite writers.  I've only read a handful of his novels--Gerald's Game, The Stand, The Dead Zone, The Green Mile, and this one, 11/22/63--and a larger number of his short stories.  Horror is not a genre I generally enjoy as I find that even authors as talented as Mr. King have trouble sustaining the appropriate level of tension.  This is why I find his short stories generally of higher quality than his novels, which I think are usually much weaker.<br /><br />Even so, I find many of Mr. King's skills as a writer to be nearly unequalled and, as his work has widened and matured, I have found him more appealing.  His ability to commit to the world he creates draws the reader in and makes one suspend disbelief.  He creates sympathetic and memorable characters that don't blend together as time passes.  There may not be another writer whose use of foreshadowing to create tension and atmosphere is as skilled.<br /><br />In 11/22/63, for example, he gives us a single impossibility in the form of this \\"hole into the past\\".  Everything else follows logically from the acceptance of this point.  Jake Epping/George Amberson is an excellent protagonist/guide who encounters a host of excellent characters (my favorites being the entire town of Jodie, TX).  And not only does he use the changing color card man as a nice piece of foreshadowing, Jake/George's gradual understanding of time's \\"harmonics\\", and the well-known history of the Kennedy assassination and its possible change helps to ratchet up tension.<br /><br />To be honest, I can't help but admit that this is an excellent novel, certainly my favorite of his.  So, what is it that turns me off to Mr. King?  Something I call the \\"gross out factor\\".  Mr. King always finds a way to gross me out in an unexpected way.  That image always overshadows whatever enjoyment I've taken in his work.  In this novel, I can't shake the image of Al coughing out his bloody lungs into maxi pads.  Ugh!  I can only hope this is not the main thing I remember when I think back over this novel years from now.  But, if my memories of The Stand are any hint, I'm not counting on it.<br /><br />Let me finish with this: whatever his strengths and weakness and my personal proclivities, I admire Stephen King greatly.

And not only does he use the changing color card man as a nice piece of foreshadowing, Jake/George's gradual understanding of time's \\"harmonics\\", and the well-known history of the Kennedy assassination and its possible change helps to ratchet up tension.<br /><br />To be honest, I can't help but admit that this is an excellent novel, certainly my favorite of his.  So, what is it that turns me off to Mr. King?  Something I call the \\"gross out factor\\".  Mr. King always finds a way to gross me out in an unexpected way.  That image always overshadows whatever enjoyment I've taken in his work.  In this novel, I can't shake the image of Al coughing out his bloody lungs into maxi pads.  Ugh!  I can only hope this is not the main thing I remember when I think back over this novel years from now.  But, if my memories of The Stand are any hint, I'm not counting on it.<br /><br />Let me finish with this: whatever his strengths and weakness and my personal proclivities, I admire Stephen King greatly.  I would suspect this comparison has been made before, but I find Stephen King to be the Edgar Allan Poe of his generation.  And, like Poe, I suspect his works will last.

B000JMLKCG|4.0|Having just finished reading Thomas Hardy's Tess of the de'Ubervilles I just had to read another of his books.<br />I found this one and enjoyed it just as much if not more so.<br /><br />I'm sort of on a run of reading classic books.  Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type.  You get so much more out of a book that way.<br /><br />While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today.  This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again.  A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.<br /><br />Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.<br />Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading.  I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.<br />I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature.

B005723JSQ|4.0|This so fairy tale-ish!  With a damsel in distress, a prince and a happily ever after!  I'm a woman in my forties, but inside I'm still a girl who loves fairy tales; and I loved this particular one!<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella's tales, if I may say, are all over the top as  far as the scenes are concerned; some may come across as unbelievable.  Her heroines always appear to be intellectually-challenged, though always possessing a big heart.  Thing is, her stories are always so hilarious one tends to forget about the unbelievability of it all.  Most importantly, amidst the funnies, there's always that underlying lesson about life, love, good character, etc.<br /><br />One thing different about this book- there were footnotes!  Ms. Kinsella would normally put in the side notes in between the lines, making them part of the story text; but this time she used footnotes.  It was kind of distracting, really!  But footnotes or no footnotes, I will always look forward to reading her books.

B0030BCCB6|5.0|This three disc box set presents us with the first three Fleetwood Mac albums.  They are returned to their original LP configurations and audio mixes.  And that is a good thing.  The versions offered on the Complete Blue Horizons Sessions Box Set sound great, I have no complaints about the remastering done for it.  It's the inclusion of far too much studio talk and use of too many false starts on many of the songs that takes away from full enjoyment of the set.  How many times do we need to hear a song's opening riff repeated?<br /><br />By comparison this set is a blessing in its simplicity.  The CDs are well mastered and sound excellent.  The packaging is kept to the basics as well, with eco friendly reproductions of the original album sleeves.  The only thing missing is the full gatefold image on the cover of Mr. Wonderful.  It's a tacky joke that only works the first time you see the cover.  So not reproducing it here is a benefit.<br /><br />So with the emphasis not on packaging, ultimately what this box set highlights is the music.  There is no booklet with rare photos and essays praising the band. There are no unnecessary additions of any kind to bloat the set.  At the heart of it, what is here are three CDs of Fleetwood Mac playing blues music very well.  Concentrating on the music is a good thing.
0307387178|3.0|I look up to Jon Krakauer.  He has a great life experience.  He has been a successful mountain climber and now a great author.  Perhaps he understands Chris McCandless.  I certainly don't.  Here is a smart young man who just graduated from a top ranked college.  He spends the next year bumming around the west and Alaska to discover his true self.  Then he makes a trip to Alaska, and starves to death in an abandoned bus.  I understand his intelligence, idealism, and desire for a non-material life.  He did his family a great disservice-as much as a druggie who dies of an overdose.  For the rest of time, his family will forever think of what they could have done to prevent this tragedy.<br /><br />I feel for the family.  However, reading the book I felt like telling Chris to get off his high horse and submit to what life is about.  Chris didn't leave a legacy, only pain and sorrow.  He could have been of service to society and been a benefit.  His forays into Washington DC to the poor areas show that he was aware of the unmet needs of some of society.  Rather he travelled the west living off hand outs and seeing the scenery.  He didn't even let his mom and dad know where he was.<br /><br />This is an OK read about a misguided young adult.  I feel for his family and the suffering they have gone through.

159420229X|1.0|I heard Joshua Foer interviewed on NPR about this book and when he said to one of the callers that this book had new methods of memorizing I immediately ordered it on Amazon. If you want this book to learn to memorize with new methods FORGET IT! There are dozens of books on AMAZON that can do this, every book I have ever purchased did a better job than this one.<br /><br />This book is about his story into being in the Memory competition with little to no methods of how he does it. A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. Buy books by Harry Lorayne and learn real methods of memory.<br /><br />I rarely write reviews but I feel that I was duped into this purchase by Mr. Foer's NPR interview. If I picked this book up at a book store I would not have wasted my time on it.<br /><br />I bought this book for myself and children (My teen son is in Pre-Med). I advised my children not to waste their time on this book, they will learn more playing Nintendo than reading THIS book...and normally I advise them to read more and play less.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|\\"Super 8\\" on Blu-ray was excellent, with a picture and sound 5 star. The story has an interesting screenplay, but suffers terribly in the end. With so much inherent power of the \\"creature\\" it is difficult to accept the mediocre end of this  movie, since the E.T. decided at the last minute  make a spaceship just using  scrap  with the power of your mind. The logical deduction is that the E.T. could have done it all before all the confusion he pitched throughout the movie, but then the movie would need a new and more intelligent screenplay, or a new story. The film holds our attention and is quite fun, except for the final very silly that is not worthy of producer Steven Spielberg and of director  J.J. Abrams. So I give only 4 stars to the overall.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Sci/fi films have been much too few and far between. Wait, make that good sci/fi films. With utter bombs like AVATAR (aka POCAHONTAS or FERN GULLY (take your pick) in outer space) and the purely dreadful THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, it has been a while since we've seen a rollicking good epic sci/fi-fantasy that comes across as fun and with a breath of originality. But it definitely delivered in Disney's JOHN CARTER.<br /><br />I will admit I had lower expectations going in on this one. I had such high hopes for Disney's PRINCE OF PERSIA a couple years ago, but the storyline and characters were just too simple and predictable. But here, with JOHN CARTER, there's a mild complexity to the story that delivers on the right levels.<br /><br />The story starts out with Captain John Carter, former Confederate soldier, being hounded by the Union soldiers to help fight in a war against the Native Americans in Arizona. But when Carter tries to escape from an attack, he winds up hiding out in a mysterious cave with strange markings and lots of gold. And that's when the strange man appears from nowhere, and John Carter suddenly finds himself transported across the galaxy to Mars. With a world on the edge of destruction, an evil warlord with a powerful weapon, and a mysterious race of beings representing a goddess, John Carter must decide which side of the war to fight on -- or whether to fight at all. But the fate of an entire race is in his hands. And it isn't only a warlord after him -- something much more powerful wants John Carter dead.<br /><br />CGI runs rampant throughout the film, but it's never overdone or obvious -- it's subtle in all the right ways, but delivering epic and astounding shots. There's a wonderful exotic look to the film that I don't think has been seen in years. The sets are amazing, and definitely took my imagination to task.<br /><br />My only beef with the film is the acting in the very first few scenes, where Taylor Kitsch (playing the titular hero) comes across a slight bit stiff. Once John Carter's on Mars working through his character development, he seems to come into his own. Lynn Collins is breath-taking as the Princess, and Mark Strong pulls off another great performance as well. The side characters complement the storyline and the main handful of leads.<br /><br />After I left the theater, it kept growing in my mind, just how much I enjoyed JOHN CARTER. The music (another wonderful score by Michael Giacchino) is haunting and truly worthy of this epic tale based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' source material. There are some very fun nods to the book series the movie originates from, and readers of those will be chuckling along the way. Don't miss out on this one.) comes across a slight bit stiff.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I thought I'd read this before the film came out and the the inevitable Hunger Games backlash started and, to my surprise, actually enjoyed it. The writing is clear and concise, the sparse descriptions evoke striking mental images of the settings and the story, what little there is, keeps you turning pages. However, even accepting that this was written for teenagers, I found the characterisations are wafer thin and the human emotions even thinner. Also, the Hunger Games themselves are long and drawn out and not as readable as the lead up to them. Finally, I felt a little cheated at the way the book ends, or rather doesn't. While I've nothing against trilogies, it would have been better for the first book to hint at a sequel rather than simply stopping mid narrative and cajoling you to read the next book. That's not a novel, that's a non-too-subtle marketing campaign.

1612130607|5.0|I started reading this trilogy because I heard it was featured on the Today Show. I didn't know anything about the books, the author, or the sexy subject matter. As a rule, I also do not read erotic novels. BUT - I was pretty much hooked on this story from the first few chapters. I quite literally could not stop reading these books - I would stay up until 1am reading, read while I was cooking and watching TV, and disregard household chores to read. In a matter of four days, I just finished the last book in the trilogy (Fifty Shades Freed) and I have to admit I'm sad that the story is over - its like a break-up.  EL James created a story that left me invested in the characters.  I may have to read these books again. I wish there would be a book or two from Christian's point of view -  more than just the teaser at the end of this book.

There is no loading icon, there is no BD LIVE icon, just frozen on the screen which made me try two copies and return/exchange nonsense. So yes YOU NEED internet connection otherwise this would NEVER PLAY at all unless you wait long enough and it aborts? I haven't tried waiting that long so I can't confirm that. Anyway, STUPID DISC DESIGN regarding interactive features.

Song after song,  with the exception of the last 2 tracks,  One Moment in Time and The Star Spangled Banner (  thank God they had the decency to not ruin that !! ) , had this annoying,  canned sounding disco beat getting in the way of that incredible voice.

0440422973|3.0|The problem for an English reader of this sentimental story is that he can't know how exaggerated it is. Do Americans really behave so oddly at Christmas? Is it possible that a family which decides not to put something called a \\"Frosty\\" (seems to be a model of a snowman) on its roof could be ostracised by all the neighbours? Do Americans preparing to go on a cruise think it perfectly normal to acquire a tan from a machine before departing?

B005V4FJC4|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I HATE Christmas music.  When the radio stations start playing all carols all the time, I turn it off for 2 months.  However, I decided to give this album a try since I am a huge fan of She & Him (and Zooey especially). This album must've been played a few dozen times during the season by me and I enjoyed every minute of it. It sounds like a very retro Christmas.  The songs are sung but not over sung (a la Christina, Celine, etc.). The only slightly disappointing song on the album to me was \\"Baby it's Cold Outside\\".  I would have preferred that one were slowed down a bit.  The quick tempo didn't match the flirtiness of the song.

0817439390|5.0|I am a complete amateur photographer who has always used the full auto mode or presets on my DSLR.  The idea of aperture, ISO, and shutter speed were completely foreign and mysterious to me.  I wanted to buy a book that would help explain some of these ideas and ended up buying this one after reading reviews and recommendations.  I couldn't be happier.  After the first few short chapters, I was comfortably playing with my camera in full manual mode and actually UNDERSTOOD how the adjustments I made would affect the resulting exposure.  I often read technical literature, so your learning curve may vary.  But as a complete \\"noob\\" to photography, this book was a VERY user-friendly way of maximizing the use of my DSLR.  In fact (and my wallet will see this as a con), it's because of what I learned from this book that I realized that I seriously needed to upgrade my old and outdated DSLR.

B002BE7JE8|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />All Andy Barclay wants for his birthday is a Good Guy doll; this seasons best seller. His mother Karen purchases the doll from a hobo, only problem is that this \\"Good Guy\\" is inhabited by the soul of Charles `Chucky' Lee Ray, a voodoo serial killer who has sworn revenge on the cop who killed him. Chucky's plans change when he discovers that he can be a real boy again, suddenly it becomes a race against time to save Andy's soul.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />The plot may be thin but Child's Play delivers plenty of chills. Tom Holland builds suspense with clever pacing, we wait tentatively as sinister Chucky is slowly revealed to us. Brad Dourif's vocal performance and the design and puppetry of the Chucky doll are the films iconic features. Child's Play is a psychological thriller that packs plenty of suspense.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />It's hammer time for the babysitter; am i the only one who didn't feel sorry for her?<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The working title for the film was `Blood Buddy'.

B005HXGE9G|4.0|Peter Gabriel is a worldwide star. He could have picked any female backup singer. For whatever reason he picked one with a weak warble and questionable pitch. ??? I think if given enough time he could have pitch-corrected her voice using modern software. I mention this because it makes the recordings with her in it (Don't Give Up, etc) not worth revisiting. Peter sounds fine...he always does even in \\"old\\" tracks like Intruder. Also, some orchestrations sound better that others. As a long time Peter Gabriel fan I couldn't help comparing the originals with these new versions. There is something about the older versions that, somehow, lend them credence and validity; ie, they sounded rough originally but that's what they were meant to be. These new versions aren't lost on me. I appreciate the orchestrations. Some were more challenging than others. The only weak - albeit important - point is the choice of female background singer. Where was Sinead O'Connor or Kate Bush when you need 'em?

Please feel comfortable knowing that this is a good, clean movie that can be watched and felt by everyone. *WARNING!* Please keep a box of tissues on hand.
B0057ZAA0S|3.0|There's no way this could escape my bluray collection. Great quality and cool bonus material. Not much difference from it's dvd edition. Too bad the extras came in standard def. Still is a pretty good film to have as part your collection.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|As silly as it sound, this game is crazy addicting. If you like puzzle games you will like this. As you go on you unlock more and more levels
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I definitely recommend this game.  It has good graphics and fun play.  You can add spin to the ball and throw a curve.  Try it, you'll like it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read a ton of reviews saying not to purchase this for the kindle. I found that to be completely wrong. The only pictures I had a little trouble with were the two handwriten letters. Other than that, no problem. Please do not hesitate to buy this book off reviews that may not be true.<br /><br />I read the book in about two days, the characters and writing really suck you in. Overall very enjoyable.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Never having read Willam Landay, I am now a fan.  I intend to find more of his books.  He held my interest from the very first sentence.  Excellent read.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Great price for what you're getting. Great interviews and behind the scenes discussions with writer, director and actors. Nothing more to add. So stop reading and buy this awesome Anniversary special edition, sit down and enjoy watching again this american classic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love building up money, spend it on games, and then build up the money again. the cycle never stops
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book is a romance book I have nerver read.  Without pictures, it brings you into the world of the characters, feelings and thoughts.  It also take you into secret territory of romance that a lot of people don't acknowledge but its all in this book.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have been looking for a game like this for a longgg time. I absolutely love it. it's similar to that bakery game on FB that was shut down earlier this year. Thank you teamlava!  add me as your neighbor, imanieyes.
0529064847|5.0|Purchased because of the many positive recommendations I received for this edition. very functional for bible study. comfortable size. a good purchase.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|Awesome film and great edition. Lots of extras with the cast and crew and even a few games and several deleted scenes. If you love the film you're gonna love this bluray special edition.
B0015AARJI|4.0|This controller works as it should for the ps3.  The only thing is the letters printed on the controller like the sony logo or the word sixaxis on the top look kind of different from the other controllers i have purchased in-store.  Also the code bar on the back is different, but maybe it's because it was shipped from over seas and they make it different, or maybe it's just me.  Just wasn't sure if this was just a good knock off.  But for the record, it works just as good.
B006ON41FC|4.0|however, you can bet it in two days. would like to see more challenges in the game. possibly different levels so you so not get tired of the same level.
0767817478|3.0|This creature's name is Zilla, and was featured in Godzilla the Final Wars. The real Godzilla beat the mississippi out of Zilla and fried him like a turkey with his hot breath. Just so you know... he was beat up by the Original. Beats me why producers decided to go with this version of computer generated monster- but the story was okay so I gave it 3stars. I own it, it completes my collection.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a little difficult to get into but once I did, it was hard to put down and I have told a lot of people about it.  Really opened my eyes about North Korea.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie turned out to be one of my favorite movies.  I have watched it numerous times and still find it funny, and I have a tendency to be a bit cynical with movies.  VERY entertaining for the whole family!
B001P829VY|5.0|You will learn that it is a must to get along in this world and not to be greedy. Bogart as you would not normally see him. This is a classic.
B006PGL7OQ|3.0|I don't really have a short attention span, yet for me this movie was too long.  Loved the acting.  Well done over all.  Not crazy about the ending but I have my opinions as to what it means.  One hour long would have made the story better.  Two hours too much.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Awesome value for a great addition to our collection. Love the Supernatural....on season 4 now can't wait to get to Season 6.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall was great. The music is perfectly song and you felt that you were at Royal Albert Hall sitting  and watching this wonderful play. The sets were special and actors were just a joy. For the fans of the Phantom of the Opera this is a must have. After the play is over a special surprise is waiting for you. Go out and buy it.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This was surprisingly a really good movie.  The commercials that I had seen previously didn't do it any justice.  The whole family enjoyed this one and we'll watch it again in the near future.
1419702238|5.0|My daughter loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. Cabin fever is a very cute book and would recommend the books.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great weather tool for local weather.  I use it daily.  Does not take much time to find out local weather either.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|HBO does it again.  The Game of Thrones.story, for those of you who haven't read it, takes place long ago when the death of an important advisor to the king has died, setting into a series of events that will draw the 7 kingdoms of Westeros into chaos with intrigue.  Sean Bean plays Eddard Stark, the warden of he north, a noble man who is called into service for his king, a boyhood friend.  Without giving too much away, he resulting series of events sweeps every character in this incredible story not a whirlwind of betrayal and murder, leading eventually to war ( which is next season).<br /><br />The best way to describe the (very) sweeping epic Game of Thrones is like Lord of the Rings, only with more violence and more sex.  It is a very adult story without the usual stereotypes and plot contrivances of normal fantasy stories.  The genius of the story, other than it's sweep, is how the author, George RR Martin, keeps you on edge.  Do not get to attached to any character as he has no problem killing off even major characters.  This being HBO and a miniseries, none of the subtext is left out.  This is NOT a story for children or those with delicate sensibilities.  It is often shocking, brutal, violent, very sexual and yet thrilling and sensational.  The biggest surprise for me was Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lanister, a man of great complexities.  The Emmy he got was well deserved.  This series will only get better as time goes on.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Quite fun...more than i thought it would be. Some are easy puzzles...some really make you think. Great if you want a distraction that isnt totally mindles.
B004LROUNG|4.0|In this book Grisham returns to the theme which brought him many loyal followers. His characters are almost real and the plot doesn't finally reveal itself until the end with the more noble ones coming out ok. Clean reading with humor, people showing their warts and all.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is an action-packed thrill ride whose world is totally engrossing. It is fun young adult fare that can be enjoyed equally by adults. At the same time, it is a missed opportunity to further explore the dystopian world in which it is set.<br /><br />Once you start reading The Hunger Games it is hard to put it down. The action is non-stop as Katniss fights for survival in the arena. Katniss is a strong female heroine that readers will really root for. She is smart and resourceful and willing to put her self in danger to help the people she cares about.<br /><br />There is also a love triangle that will appeal to a lot of people. It's kind of similar to Twilight, but Katniss is a way more interesting heroine than Bella.<br /><br />I found The Hunger Games to be a let down in one area. it begins to set up a great dystopian society for all of us dystopia/sci-fi fans, but it doesn't explore it as well as it could. Katniss spends most of her time in the arena, so the reader catches glimpses of the dystopia outside, and of course the Hunger Games themselves are a symptom of the dystopia, but we never delve into the deeper reasons behind it. Not that every young adult novel has to do this. I just thought it was a missed opportunity.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The Hunger Games is a fast paced, engrossing read. Despite its missed opportunities, it's a novel no one should miss out on.<br /><br />See more reviews @ [...]
0449806979|4.0|This momentary frenzy for French parenting is all because of Pamela Druckerman's new book Bringing Up Bébé: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting, outlines what she has determined by observing the way French parents interact with their children. The book is based on her own experience raising children in Paris and her willingness to disclose details from her family life.    Druckerman shared her very own issues in trying to adopt some French parenting techniques.  She had an interview with WSJ's Gary Rosen regarding the French lessons below and French parenting techniques.  In brief, French parenting isn't just about sacrifice.Authority is one of the most impressive elements of French parenting and probably the most difficult one to master. The author indicates that many French parents she met present an easy, calm authority with their children. Their kids actually listen to them. French children are not constantly dashing off, talking back or engaging in prolonged negotiations. Of course, French parenting wouldn't be worth dealing with when it created automatic and joyless kids.    It is undeniable that French parenting results in children that are, essentially, easier to handle than American children. After examining French parenting in action, she determined that the French model was exemplified by less involved parents.  She also explains that when American parents tend to have children and then make the children the new focus of their lives. However, French parents have children and then incorporate those children into the lives they are already living.    Even though there are admirable aspects to the French parenting model, French parenting might not be all rainbows. The truth is that parenting styles and methods have been highly correlated with their own cultures and background. Parents who show extensive interest on French parenting or Tiger Parenting have to keep in mind that there are tons of researches showing marked and quantifiable differences among different cultures when it comes to parenting.    more info; [...]
B000OP1M6M|3.0|I really liked the style of the watch, but the movement stopped working after about 25 days. I didn't get the Seiko warranty because Amazon is not an authorized seller, but they allowed me to return it for a full refund. I ended up with a Casio Edifice.
B0064MT1U8|5.0|An old favorite movie now sharper, clearer, and prettier than ever. Totally worth the upgrade for the Shakespeare fan, and also worth checking out for the newcomer.

1439156816|5.0|On Writing by Stephen King<br />My rating: 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />On Writing is a real treat for both Stephen King fans and aspiring writers. There are two main themes to the book. There is King's memoir about coming to be a writer, which is full of interesting anecdotes and King's unique, genuine conversational style. Then there are the writing tips, most of which aren't particularly profound, but it's the easy going way they are presented and King's fair amount of cheer-leading that make On Writing work.<br /><br />The memoir section of On Writing is great. Stephen King fans will love this section and it's worth reading On Writing for this part alone. King writes a lot about his experience as a young man trying to get into the writing business and his inspiration and writing process for some of his best novels including Misery, Carrie, Bag of Bones and many others. This book is a must read for Stephen King fans.<br /><br />The advice section is terrific not because of anything profound, but because of the down to earth tone that King uses to discuss it. Stephen King is a good cheerleader for aspiring writers. He gives some advice that is very specific. Read a lot and writer a lot. Read The Elements of Style by Strunk and White. Write without distractions. A lot of his advice is less specific, but it is encouraging.<br /><br />Bottom Line: On Writing is a must read for Stephen King fans and an inspirational read for aspiring writers.<br /><br />See more reviews @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The best movie I have seen in a long time. Rented it for instant download to test my new Roku and it worked perfectly.
B004RSCWZ2|1.0|I was very sorry that I purchased this disc.Susan Tedeschi's music voice just doesn't cut for me.She might be pretty but I didn't like her sound.Also,I was hoping for more rock from this group.
B006362ZR6|5.0|This album is great! I love The Fray. If you like them too, I recommend you buying this CD. I don't have any issues with it.
B0059XTUMC|2.0|I watched this Oscar-winning BEST PICTURE and couldn't believe what I was watching.  Having seen all three versions of A STAR IS BORN I was completely floored at how blatantly borrowed the storyline for this film was.  I kept waiting for a twist, a new road, an imaginative leap.  And all there was to the plot was A STAR IS BORN...but with a happy - or sappy - ending.  Speaking of \\"sappy ending\\" this film also borrowed much from Scorsese's NEW YORK, NEW YORK.  And in the dressing room scene where sound begins to intrude upon the Artist's life I expected the camera to pan over and there'd be Rod Serling!  So a pinch of the recipe for this movie was also lifted from THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  SINGING IN THE RAIN is also in the mix - and lest less knowledgeable viewers think that Ludovic Bource composed the entire score, he didn't.  Borrowed was the best piece of music in the film - a long, passionate crescendo from Bernard Herrmann's score for Hitchcock's VERTIGO.  Why couldn't the composer have come up with something of his own for this pivotal sequence in THE ARTIST?  Why couldn't the story have the least bit of originality to it?  Why was Malcolm McDowell even bothered for a pointless part lasting all of twenty seconds?  Why didn't the truly best actor in the movie win the Oscar instead - and that was Uggie the dog?  Why was this movie even made?<br /><br />Some people will claim that this movie is an homage to all movies in general.  That sounds good and noble.  But when ALL a movie is is one homageful scene after another...then, to me, the effort smacks more of unoriginality than anything else.  And I still can't figure out why music from a 1958 Alfred Hitchcock movie was used to help score a movie dealing with the transitional phase from silent to sound in the history of the cinema.  What was the true aesthetic rationale for this choice?  Laziness, perhaps?<br /><br />I will say this:  for viewers NOT familiar with the body parts that went to fashion this Frankenstein's monster of a movie, the story may seem wonderful.<br />And it is a very good thing that this movie is getting attention. But not for this movie's sake.  No.  But if watching this silent, black and white film can excite younger viewers to want to see more black and white and even actual films from the silent era, then that is a very good thing.  And I must admit that it was refeshing to see a movie without a single CGI shot in it!<br /><br />I am tracking Uggie, however, on the IMDB.  I want to see more of that cute, colorful canine!monster of a movie, the story may seem wonderful.<br />And it is a very good thing that this movie is getting attention.

B001U7B4T8|1.0|This was a fantastic concert. One that I watched many times after I recorded it on VHS. The highlite of the show was the \\"everyone\\" version of \\"My Back Pages\\" Where is it? I would love to pay real money to have a good DVD or Blue ray copy. But this half-baked poor excuse of a concert DVD is not at all what I want. Where's the beef?
B004TI5N38|5.0|This book,Zero Day, was quite different from the author's previous books;  the setting was unique for me since I live in West Virginia.<br />This is the same intriguing plot but such different subject matter than David has previously utilized.  Usually authors are very unkind in their coverage of West Virginia, it's people and our heritage.  I did not find these things to be present.  The historic ancestry is what it is and it needs to be understood that the present is not always the same and that fiction is fiction.  The book kept my attention to the very end,  As readers we all know about books that we don't want to end, this is one of those.  Enjoy the adventure.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmour may be one of the most underrated musicians of the past few generations.  This work, which in my opinion is complimentary to the 'Live in Gdansk\\" DVD, highlights \\"On an Island\\", which I have found to be one of the better CD's from the past ten years.  Yes, I am biased as I was weaned on Pink Floyd, but listen to the On an Island set and you will find a very introspective set of songs.  Of course, the classic Pink Floyd songs (Dark Side selections, Shine on you crazy diamond, Comfortably Numb) are done in impeccable fashion, and the guests (Crosby, Nash, Bowie) are all fantastic additions to this set.<br /><br />The musicianship is of course beyond reproach, and the video quality is fine contrary to some of the other reviews.  Suffice to say if you are a Pink Floyd fan this is a must have.  I would highly recommend you also buy Live in Gdansk.  I cannot get enough of David's work and only wish I have the opportunity to see him live before it is too late.

1455816361|5.0|CRT has really done the impossible....they have brought the complete table of contents of the book to life, and maintained faithfulness to the stories (it's not really a novel) and to Bradbury's poetic prose, and that is no mean feat. It's spread over 6 discs and runs nearly six hours. Jerry Robbins and the CRT have numerous productions under their belt and are the most prolific of production companies in the genre of \\"theater of the ear\\". Give them a try, you won't be sorry.

0439023513|1.0|I read the Hunger Games and Catching Fire and I LOVED them.<br />So, obviously, I was going to read Mockingjay.<br />AND I HATED IT.<br />Literally, 75% of this whole entire book was extremely boring. It took me months to finish the book because of how boring it was.<br />SERIOUSLY? Nothing was happening AT ALL. Katniss was just in District 13 doing literally nothing all day. I hated it so much I was in pain from this boring book. I've never read anything more boring in my entire life. Reading this book was PUNISHMENT. But I needed to know what happened.<br />And then what happens? Everyone just DIES or is GONE FOREVER. REALLY?!?!? That's your ending, Suzanne?!?!<br />I'M NOT EXPECTING A HAPPY ENDING, BUT I AM DEFINITELY NOT EXPECTING THIS CRAP. IT WAS OBVIOUS SUZANNE JUST WANTED TO FINISH THE BOOK SO SHE JUST CAME UP WITH SOME SORT OF ENDING AND WENT WITH IT. IT WAS LACKING CREATIVITY. SOMEHOW I ALREADY KNEW THIS WAS ALL GOING TO HAPPEN. EVERYONE WOULD JUST DIE OR DISAPPEAR. UGH! I HATE THIS BOOK SO MUCH.<br /><br />Suzanne, I expect a redo of this whole book due on Monday.
B005KELW26|4.0|This is a great cover. I was originally attracted to it because of the color. The purple is not to bright, but certainly more interesting than black or red. I have had it for four months now an it is holding up perfectly. The device is kept securely in place with the tabs for this purpose.  The magnetic clasp work great and I use the inside pocket a lot. Well worth the price.

B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|At first, I thought it might be a good haunted inn story. I soon realized the acting and writing was some of the worst I'd seen in ANY movie in awhile. I fast-forwarded grueling slow scenes, hoping it might get better. But it got even much worse.<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this movie. It's just that bad. I felt very ripped off and was mad at myself for paying for the rental. Not scary, stupid annoying characters, bad acting, bad everything!!!!!!
0393061310|5.0|Because I had heard that this book was an extended attempt to reduce the whole of human civilization to geography, I was wary of it being a long and dreary exercise in simple determinism.  I could not have been more wrong!  Not only is this book an absolutely first rate intellectual adventure, but it is a nuanced interpretation that deserves every effort.  Even better, it is a complete delight as a reading experience, full of fascinating, unexpected ideas and facts on every single page, and superlatively written.<br /><br />As I interpreted it, the crux of his ideas are: 1) land must be fertile, large enough for widespread farming, and the climate the right temperature; 2) geographical boundaries - or their lack -  must allow dissemination of ideas (and seeds) across similar landscapes via trade (i.e. horizontally, not vertically cutting across latitudes); 3) a wide variety of animals, in particular domesticable large mammals (for food and muscle labor), must be available to complement farming culture.  Eur-Asia had the cow, horse, and pig, a unique endowment that other regions lacked.  When all of these pre-conditions are met, a people can convert from hunter-gather bands to farming communities  in massive numbers.  Once they do so, civilization can arise as they 4) begin to accumulate surplus foodstuffs, expanding population growth, 5) freeing workers from hunting and thus becoming sedentary, eventually 6) to develop specialized labor and hierarchies (in tribes, clans and eventually nations), enabling them to create 7) sophisticated administrative apparatuses (to govern populations where everyone cannot know each other as they do in bands and tribes), writing to preserve knowledge, and more complex technologies.  Finally, beyond superior technology and organization, 8) the larger groupings in cities and nations confer disease immunities on diverse populations, which devastate simpler, more isolated cultures.<br /><br />That is it in a nutshell for the ideas.  That being said, Diamond is by no means arguing any superiority of various civilizations, only that their establishment and growth are scientifically predictable when the three preconditions are met.  As such, it is neither genetic endowment nor invention that led to the dominance of the Eurasian peoples, but geographical luck.  I know it sounds too pat and deterministic to state it this way, but the true rewards of the book are a breathtaking tour of human pre-history, to the beginnings of civilization as seen through what people ate, how they obtained their food, and what barriers to further productivity they faced.<br /><br />The canvas he paints includes every major continent and civilization, from Eur-Asia to Africa, the Americas and Australia, with a concluding chapter on Japan.  Though I have been on a binge of broad-brush histories of human development and civilization, I can say without hesitation that this one is the most fascinating and fun, in addition to being the deepest inquiry into the forces that shaped human destiny.  I knew many of the details and concepts, but this book pulled everything together with subtlety and clear logic.  It is truly a masterpiece that I will read more than once.<br /><br />I do have some criticisms of the book.  First, he appears to regard the destructive collision between hunter-gatherer peoples as inevitable and unstoppable, particularly with the advent of industrial technologies.  I am not at all sure that any culture will necessarily annihilate another, particularly when we are slowly developing greater appreciation and respect of other ways of being.  Now, we can choose whether or not it will occur.  Second, towards the end, he introduces many ideas kind of helter skelter that are far less well thought through than in the first 2/3 of the book, to the point that they lack coherence.  Third, he attempts to extend the logic of his approach too far, in particular with prescriptions - e.g. that it is applicable to modern businesses, with the laughable kinds of cross-over arguments that are made in business schools from scientific research in other areas - that I found naive and superficial.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.nesses, with the laughable kinds of cross-over arguments that are made in business schools from scientific research in other areas - that I found naive and superficial.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|I don't watch much TV so when I began with this series I didn't expect I'd be so anxious to get on with the next episode. 30+ characters and they all have a purpose which makes the story rich. I love this era and British story telling!

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I am very sattisfied with this box, great design, very interesting extras. And the price was not that high. I recommend!
B005KELW26|4.0|Beside the fact that this case (and pretty much all of the cases for Kindle Fire are too pricey) we like this case very much. It is easy to get in and out, easy to close with a nice magnet and not too heavy to hold when reading or transporting.  What would make it even better would have been a pocket on the inside cover to at least insert a business card or id, a way for it to stand up more easily for reading and also some way to protect it from accidentally shutting off when trying to stand or lean the Kindle upright (the turn off button is on the bottom--a problem with the Kindle set up, not the case, per se). It provided some good protection when accidentally dropped on one occasion, but all in all, we've been easy on the Kindle and the case.  We would buy it again.

B004D7GU3M|5.0|Came earlier than expected. Was well packaged so no damage was done. Quality of sound is great! Very much satisfied.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Words can't describe my thrill upon finishing this book. It was recommended by a few book lists and I decided to venture into it even though it seemed daunting to read 61 chapters. But to my thrill I was so easily transported into a world that was so foreign to my mind, or to anything I could have imagined, that I kept thinking that Mars may seem like a closer world that that of the Japanese war lords or Daimyo in the 1600s. I am not a writing critic, but I found Clavell's style smooth making the trip into this world quite enticing and pleasant. My only disappointment was that I couldn't retain any of the many Japanese words he kept using throughout the book giving it so much authenticity and I found the ending too abrupt; I guess I just didn't want to leave this world behind.
0792164903|5.0|I love a good scary movie now and then.  And Halloween was coming up.  I bought Sleepy Hollow because I've seen it before and it scared the socks off me.  The story follows Washington Irving's story somewhat, but put a whole new spin on it.  Excellent story and scary, too.
B0073LJ61S|3.0|In my humble opinion this is just an ok effort. I'm sure it would've been much better if Ted Templeman, who produced all the DLR era music, was on board. He just seemed to know how to pull it all together with these guys!
B00785P2QC|3.0|as long as you don't mind having to check on it constanly, it can be a fun game. and it's free.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|best game ever. you should get it. add fistpump28 hi hi hi hi hi hi. I'm awesome and I know it
B005GVA2L0|5.0|With this \\"Album\\" Amy Lee and crew of great musicians have put together the sound and feel of the amazing \\"Fallen\\" with the hard driving sound of great guitar work and thundering drums and of course the unmatched singing of Amy Lee.<br />The fast pace of the album has the very focused feel to it...no wasted time or \\"space\\" in the end it is a must have for your collection.
B0009RCPX4|5.0|Ghostbuster (UMD for PSP) was a game I bought accidently while looking for the DVD disc.  I found I couldn't use it, and contacted the seller right away.  They handled the situation excellently.  I was able to sent it back with no problem and have the credit taken off my card.  I would rate the seller as a five star company.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|What a fantastic family movie with a great message! Sends a powerful message to DADS as well as spouces on how we need to support them. We loved this movie and would recommend it to everyone!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I will not support this abomination with my money. I will not pay to see one of my favorite childhood influences slowly destroyed and degraded by a deranged egomaniac just so I can see it on Blu-Ray. For me, the original theatrical trilogy (New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) is the Alpha and Omega of Star Wars. My wife feels the same way, which is partially why I chose to spend my life with her.<br /><br />My only hope at this point is that one day soon George Lucas will die, and be unable to do any more harm to his only contribution to history. After his demise, I look forward to the re-release of the untainted theatrical versions on whatever the newest technology is of the day.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If you enjoyed ,&quot;The secret of Grisly Manor&quot;, Then you'll find this to be a similar feel from Fire Maple Games. This game is much more interwoven, and there are so many places to look, they even provide you with a map so you don't get lost. The twist here that makes this fun and challenging is that you are unlocking the secret that gives you the ability to change the seasons in an instant! So what is water in one season may be dry dirt in another, or an ice block you must get around in another! Solve all the puzzles and use your items you find to unlock even more clues and keys to pathways. All leading towards the final task that restores balance and peace to this hidden world and brings your adventure to a satisfying conclusion. Highly recommended.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I have had a VCR for a long time and had bought tapes for it.  Now the VCR is out of date and I'm investing in DVDs.  Ghostbushters and Ghostbuters II are a couple of my favorite movies.  Now I can see them again with a little added clarity.
B003XVYLDU|2.0|I have heard of this book for years and thought I'd pick it up for my kindle. It is not what I expected for Science Fiction. Not really my kind of read. It jumps around to much for my liking. Too much back and forth in time.  I have read other books that handle this style better IMHO. It may have been ground breaking for its time, but it left me disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like 101 games.  I like to play with my sister and brother. I really like to play the object games. it really is fun you should try it. I enjoy it everyday.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|It was great to get re-acquainted with Jane Austin's characters in a new light.  You would definitely have had to read Pride and Prejudice to catch all of the nuances of the characters, but P.D. James does an excellent job of developing them further.  As for the murder mystery element, I thought it was a little contrived and although the conclusion was a twist, I thought that the concept of a sick man who could not lift his head to speak being the antagonist in the story was a little hard to believe.  All in all, though, the story was wonderfully told and P.D James once again showed the great mystery writer she truly is.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this version of Solitaire much much much much better than the Windows version. It has better picture and I like the customized background feature!!
B00008BXJJ|5.0|Well, I am an old guy (50+).  Plopped this in the CD player.  Got on I35, and promptly met one of Dallas PD's finest.  Explained that this music was just really great.  He gave me a warning, and told me to slow it down.  So listen to this but carefully.  It will get you moving.  Just a fun CD.  I used to like concerts if they were train wrecks, I did not want to hear a band play their album.  I wanted loud emotional times.  This is almost as good as being there,they sound a bit to close to studio music than I like for a live recording, but really fun.  I really enjoy this CD.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Fun playing application. Takes a certain amount of skill and can frustrate you. I would recommend this app to anyone wanting a simple game to pass some down time.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Loved the movie in the theater and knew I'd add it to my DVD collection. Terrific writing. Very funny. Good characters well acted and a nice twist that I genuinely did not see coming. Kuds to Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. The whole cast shines.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|In my review of [[ASIN:B000PTYPAC Riot]], I likened it to the folder within the casing; shiny and smelling of plastic, but scrawled full of racious non-stop energy. Brand New Eyes (which reached the world on my 22nd birthday no less) also has a nice folder, but it's entirely in soft, somber paper. I think that says a lot about the album and the statement it sends out, the band maturing with each outing.<br /><br />\\"Careful\\" does have the enormity in energy and power of previous songs, but Hayley's growing into new territory here; she's made an open letter to a friend (or perhaps boyfriend?) who never made it out into the world. She's saying \\"go out and live while you can, move out of the basement and smell the roses\\", a statement both inspiring and insulting. Is the song saying \\"you can make it\\" or \\"you're such a loser\\"? You decide.<br /><br />\\"Ignorance\\" is another one sure to burrow into your head and stick for weeks. The riff explodes like fireworks before the bass kicks in sounding quite literally like an engine revving. After that it just keeps going in overdrive, but there's a kind of ferocity to it that was lacking on [[ASIN:B000PTYPAC Riot]]. We're serious now, and Hayley tramples yet again on the sad and pathetic on a train of delightful megalomania. The song however is irresistable.<br /><br />\\"Playing God\\" plays like a rock ballad by the numbers - it's just as grey as the album cover, and always takes me down a peg. The first rainy Paramore song, albeit not an entirely bad one. Nobody knows best.<br /><br />\\"Brick By Boring Brick\\" is one of the highlights of the album. Enormous, melodic, vocally wonderful, it's an epic take on living in the colorful world of fantasy; with plenty of references to actual fairy tales. This is the kind of song Paramore are known for immortalizing, the undeniable hook is right there, ready to merge with your bloodstream. Maybe it's ultimately about escapism (or insanity), a lot of the album seems to deal with not being able to fess up to reality in one way or another. Play this to anyone with a set of ears, if they don't react to it in some way, they've got steel running through their veins. It's almost like the song was too massive to be contained, so it just breaks out and explodes in a final \\"bap-bap-bap!\\".<br /><br />\\"Turn It Off\\" is a bit more filler, rocking on by the numbers. For better or worse, there isn't much to be said about this song.<br /><br />\\"The Only Exception\\" gives way to the acoustic ballad again, but Hayley's talent is being able to tug on the heartstrings even if it's schmaltzy. Trying too hard? Sure. Succeeding even so? Yes. It's the kind of song a million newly beloved (women) can take to heart and fill in with their own life stories, but what's really wrong with that?<br /><br />\\"Feeling Sorry\\" hammers the point home even further. By goshdarn, this band is not about to be couch potatoes. They're out to make a career, tour a bang, craft a rainbow, work until they drop. Perhaps when Hayley's ninety years old, she'll finally get a chance to stop and smell the roses.<br /><br />\\"Looking Up\\" is \\"Feeling Sorry\\" again, in reverse. Repackaged.<br /><br />\\"Where The Lines Overlap\\" has a strange little giddy going on. There's such an odd structure to it that it almost sounds like a different band. The same tempo and the same enormity as always before though.<br /><br />\\"Misguided Ghosts\\" is the second acoustic ballad. It's even more scaled down than \\"Exception\\" though, a tad more distant like it was recorded in a bigger, damper room with a smaller microphone. It kind of touches on the same subject as \\"We Are Broken\\", how everyone feels abandoned and left to scatter in the wind like leaves. It's very nice to hear fingers slide along guitar strings though, seldom do little \\"faults\\" like that make it into the final mix of a song.<br /><br />\\"All I Wanted\\" is the \\"spill your heart and guts\\"-finisher. It opens just as soft as anything, but the chorus is absurdly overblown, andHayley nearly screams instead of sings; it's a from-the-gut outpouring, the be-all end-all. It's a bit much.<br /><br />\\"Decode\\" is included as a bonus track on this European version, and even though it was put to use in an utter abomination of a movie, I'm going to go out on a limb and state it's really a great song, underrated even. The simple beauty of notes hanging in the air combined with the vocals being nearly preachingly sincere, it sounds like a diary exploding in a church, but in a good way. Some sincerity, almost agressive and plenty huge. Just listen to the song with an open mind, and shake that stupid movie from your memory.<br /><br />I was able to aquire another bonus track, \\"Ignorance (Acoustic Version)\\", and what a gem it is! The guitars are properly recorded, and the vocals, while sharp, don't drown out the entire proceedings as on [[ASIN:B000PTYPAC Riot]]. Based on this (and that short-but-oh-so-sweet MTV Unplugged performance), Paramore should really do a full acoustic album of old songs.<br /><br />I'm still stuck in the basement, and I'm still a sucker for escapism, but this album still reaches my innards, and that says a lot about the power of the music and a great vocalist. Happy birthday to me!Hayley nearly screams instead of sings; it's a from-the-gut outpouring, the be-all end-all.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore is simply an irresistable band. Young? Surely. Emo punky? Possibly. Infectious? Plenty! There's an unspoken taboo over them; whenever you mention them to an uninitiated, they'll kind of laugh or shrug it away, but I'm here to tell you that age or label isn't a measure of quality. Just because you have orange hair and sing into a carrot doesn't mean you lack buckets of talent and spans of energy. Even though there's like a quazidrillion versions of this album, picking it up in any shape or form is a win; CD, vinyl, bonus tracks, Japanese, MVI, it's all good.<br /><br />\\"For A Pessimist..\\" kicks off the album in high-octane mode. Telling of all to come, it's borderline obnoxious. I can almost understand the haters. But the chorus is solid stuff, and Hayley's only warming up.<br /><br />\\"That's What You Get\\" is another uptempo rocker with Paramore's signature reverberating guitar notes (similar to The Edge in U2), dealing with matters of the heart. It sticks like glue without knocking you flat.<br /><br />\\"Hallelujah\\" is the stuff of arena rock glory, with very tasty vocals and the first really beautiful bridge.<br /><br />\\"Misery Business\\" is the big one, the breakthrough single. You don't have to be a prepubescant high school girl to rock out to it either, there's a fat drumline and the eerie echo of guitars in the background, even the clatter of castanets. Plus those wonderful triplets that fire off the chorus. And the vocals? Epic.<br /><br />\\"When It Rains\\" takes the tempo down just a tad; there's still a huge stomping of drums and the energy is far from waning. However, Williams proves her chops for more than punk-rock grandeur; her soft serenade is mesmerizing. One to introduce to the parents mayhaps?<br /><br />\\"Let The Flames Begin\\" crescendos in an absolutely riveting fashion; when Hayley hangs onto that \\"glory\\" note and the soft plucking of guitar strings cacophonies into a gripping chorus. Beautiful but powerful. Paramore combining all their assets into one song. It's bittersweet to hear the notes of the song fade away slowly.<br /><br />\\"Miracle\\" may be more of the same - but as promised, the energy doesn't stop, and the volume doesn't wane. It's a bit samey and doesn't quite stand out, but we all need a bit of filler to get us through the night.<br /><br />\\"crushcrushcrush\\" is a combo of poppy chorus magic and crunchy guitar riffs. There's a bit of shredding on this album, it's as close as the band ever come to a real \\"metal\\" song, but too cute to qualify.<br /><br />\\"We Are Broken\\" hits from far out on left field; opening with a quiet echo, like a distant cry through a glass bottle, it gives way to a soft piano melody and Hayley's pure, gorgeous, sad voice lamenting the broken of the world; she conveys every bullied child, victim of war, misunderstood teenager and abused talent. It's a tremendous song, and the really sad part is how few people will hear it because their inhibitions stand in the way.<br /><br />\\"Fences\\" wipes your tears quickly and the boppy, rocky hook grabs you by the belt and throws you into prance-mode. Permanent grin plastered, I dare you not to tap your foot or hum along! It took me many listens before I was able to detach enough from the melody and realize that it's a clever quip on the life of celebrities and stardom; caught miserable in a so-called perfect world.<br /><br />\\"Born For This\\" ends the album with a concert staple; the riff jumps in and takes the spotlight from this wonderful vocalist if only for a moment! The theme and unity of a choir of voices unites the crowd with the band, the fans with the crowd and ends the album in enormous style and flair.<br /><br />If there's any criticism (and this is a slight one), this is most definitely a loud album. It sounds great all the same, but the waveform spikes are like a brick wall; huge, crushing loudness almost from start to finish. If that's not your cup of tea, too bad, but it can certainly help make a gloomy day better anda good day an even better one!<br /><br />The MVI (let's call it what it is; CD + DVD) Edition also includes a few bonus tracks (on both the CD and DVD - nice touch), and all 16 tracks in 24-bit stereo. Sadly there's no DTS surround mix. The bonus tracks are as follows;<br /><br />\\"When It Rains (Demo)\\" is not much different from the final song, except the sound quality's not quite as good. An earlier demo would've been cooler for comparison purposes, but I'll take it.<br /><br />\\"Misery Business (Acoustic) (Live From Q101 Chicago)\\" is just as punchy as the original, but with the added beauty of acoustic guitars. However, on this as all acoustic tracks, Hayley's voice is mixed way too loud, and you have to turn down the volume lest she attack your ears!<br /><br />\\"Pressure (Acoustic) (Live From Q101 Chicago)\\" must be an earlier Paramore song, because I'm not a fan of it! The only pre-Riot songs I can really get into are \\"Emergency\\" and \\"Decoy\\", the rest just lack the \\"it factor\\" for me. The band were growing into talented musicians, but it takes a while.<br /><br />\\"For A Pessimist.. (Live From London)\\" sounds about as you'd expect. A fairly good live recording, but nothing you'd impress your friends with.<br /><br />\\"Born For This (Live From London)\\" has the same thing going for it; good but hardly great, you do get the added bonus of the crowd though. To see Paramore live in full glory, I'd go with [[ASIN:B001QWEE44 Paramore - The Final Riot!]].<br /><br />To sum things up, Riot! is a lot like the folder inside; shiny and smelling of plastic, but very pretty and scrawled full of joyous, racious energy.

0385523912|5.0|I could hardly put this down. Even now, a few months later, the stories still touch  my heart. I loved this so much and hope that she continues to write more and more books. Barbara Demmick has an amazing gift. When reading her book, you don't feel as if you're reading non-fiction. She writes in a truly engaging style.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is highly addictive! I find it difficult to do much else. LOL. I definitely. recommend. downloading it. Enjoy!
B0018RFLN0|4.0|I saw M:I in the theaters back when it came out.  A sense of humor really sets it apart from the usual crowd of action movies.  In particular, the scene at Langley, involving a true 'poison pen,' is fantastic.  Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Emmanuelle Beart, Vanessa Redgrave, and Jon Voight actually get some character development.  And Tom Cruise just has this twinkle in his eye the whole time--you know he's enjoying himself.  He straddles the line between cockiness and arrogance perfectly.  By comparison, MI:2 and MI:3 have paper-thin characters, recycled plotlines, and very little humor.  Cruise is dark and edgy there, with none of the first M:I's \\"Ha Ha--I pulled one over on you.\\"  It's clear the sequels' writers weren't nearly as talented.  I haven't seen MI:Ghost Protocol yet, so I can't comment there--hopefully it's humorous and there's some character development.<br /><br />As for the reviewers who feel this movie doesn't do justice to the TV series--you might be right. I grew up after the TV series went off the air, so I don't have that lurking in the back of my mind as a constant source of comparison.  FYI, I didn't think the Harry Potter films or the Lord of the Rings trilogy captured the spirit of the books, so I'm not unsympathetic to your plight.<br /><br />Either way, though, the first M:I movie is the only one I'd see again because \\"I kind of miss being disreputable\\" ;-)

B00447G2PM|5.0|I recently bought a 51\\" Samsung Plasma 3D TV (which is AWESOME) and a Sony 3D blu ray player (Wi Fi included so it's like having  a smart tv too, also awesome) and this movie is fantastic!! I'm starting my 3D collection and have a bunch of Pixar animated 3D movies, but this is my first IMAX movie and it is incredible, you feel like you are underwater with the creatures!! I should mention if you're looking for a ocean movie with cute dolphins or sharks, this isn't it, this is more about sea monsters like squids that are very ugly and scary but still fascinating none the less. Might be too scary for young kids, but is a phenomenal movie experience and a MUST BUY!!
B005U3V7MC|5.0|Reading this was like reading a continuation of Jane Austin's wonderful book \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" P.D.James has done a masterful job with the language and with the mystery elements for which she is very well known. I have read it twice and will likely read it again. The \\"E Book\\" format is new to me but certainly easy to enjoy. I especially appreciated being able to determine unfamiliar or arcane words when I could not determine the meaning from context thanks to the \\"definitions\\" feature in the \\"E\\" format.

B005VTS4EY|4.0|Good fun for a few hours and puzzle solvers will like this one. The game ran little slow on some levels, not really a gameplay issue.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I normally don't write reviews for almost anything I buy. One of those free riders I guess. I'm making an exception here to acknowledge how hilarious and relatable this book was - especially the first half where the author talk mostly about her first child and the experience of raising her in Paris. Whether you agree with her observations and conclusions or not, it will make you pause and think. Great read overall!!
B0018LMZOO|5.0|I'll be brief: This is my favorite album of all time.  Not just my favorite Moody Blues album, not just my favorite \\"AOR\\" album, not just my favorite \\"any category you want to name\\" album, but favorite of all types of all time.  The only flaw, as someone else mentioned, is its length, but that just means you can play it twice at each sitting and appreciate its perfection twice as much.

0439023513|2.0|I don't usually review books, but this time I actually feel obligated to warn my fellow THG fans. This book was not terrible the entire way through, as it did hold some of the attributes that I enjoyed from the first two books. In all honesty, I enjoyed the books in descending order simply because I felt the author had pure gold the first time around, then suffered the inability to recreate the magic as time went on. The last book was awful not because of the twists in the storyline, because I saw them coming, but because it felt like the author gave up. The ending is so rushed, I felt empty in the end. Almost like the author said, \\"Mmm, I don't think I want to write anymore.\\" and chose the crappiest, most rushed ending the editor would swallow.<br /><br />You've been warned.

B005723JSQ|2.0|I was so excited to read a new sophie kinsella that i dove right in..only to be pretty dissapointed. Ive read all the books, and although Shopaholics are my favorite, i was keeping an open mind here. I enjoy sophie kinsella's books because i believe she is a smart writer who develops silly stories, but i could actually see some of them happening, i can relate to the characters in the given situations, However the premise of this book made me confused, and the characters were not developed enough to become real. Poppy herself had no depth in my opinion, and the supposed romance between poppy and sam was bizarre instead of sweet. I hated the premise of them sharing a phone due to the fact that it was so difficult to get a new phone? I would have bought that she found the phone, and thats how they ended up meeting, but the phone thing was too strange to keep a whole relationship going. I did manage to finish the book, but even the end was strange, unfulfilling in some way, and not really what i hoped for. I hope Mrs. Kinsella doesnt try to make a series here.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|From the time you finish the girl that played with fire, your pulled like a moth to a flame to the girl who kicked the hornets nest. I haven't been able to put it down and just get excited when ever I would start a new chapter. Lisbeth Salander is the best character in any book I've ever had the pleasure of reading and getting to go on her adventures. I was able to identify with her on a lot of different levels, so it made reading even better.

B0051OZ564|3.0|Disappointed with the movie overall.  Was excited when I fist saw the previews, and the previews were much better than the actual movie itself.  Felt that it repeated itself throughout, no real originality from scene to scene.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|excellent acting, especially Maggie Smith, the sets which are the real deal,<br />it being filmed at a working castle , are exquisite.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|I'll tell you that Edgar Rice Burroughs was one of my childhood linchpins. He, more than anyone else, instilled in me a love for pulp adventure. And not to play favorites (except I guess I'm gonna) but as much as I relished Lord Greystoke, I'd always preferred Captain John Carter by a hair. It never seemed fair that while Tarzan had garnered so many film adaptations, this swashbuckling Virginian never even got close to a whiff. Until now.<br /><br />JOHN CARTER is admittedly a nebulous film title; I hear you can blame the failure of MARS NEEDS MOMS for Disney's push to disassociate the ERB project from the \\"Mars\\" label. JOHN CARTER is based (somewhat faithfully) on A PRINCESS OF MARS, the first in Burroughs' eleven volume Barsoom series, with bits from the second volume, THE GODS OF MARS, also peppered in. It's crazy that Burroughs published A PRINCESS OF MARS in serialized form a century ago. But there's a timelessness to John Carter's wild exploits. Gratifyingly, a planetary romance from 1912 still has legs in 2012. No matter the era, it's awesome escapism, a grand adventure. And as an ERB devotee, I can't help but grin big because, just as in the book, Burroughs himself (nicely played by SPY KIDS' Daryl Sabara) bookends the story.<br /><br />JOHN CARTER is Andrew Stanton's debut with directing live-action films, and I think he brings just enough of that heart and that Pixar sensibility that he'd invested in FINDING NEMO and WALL-E, although, no, JOHN CARTER won't be regarded as a classic on the same tier as those two animated gems. But there's a humanity in the story, and dazzling visuals, and unexpected humor. I love the running gag about John Carter's name.<br /><br />***possibly some minor SPOILERS now***<br /><br />The cinematic version of John Carter has been tweaked some. Unlike the gent in the books (who always had his shucks together), the John Carter we view onscreen has baggage. A devastating personal loss has rendered the former Captain of the 1st Virginian Cavalry a shell of his former self. In the untamed Arizona badlands, this Carter is a man without a cause. He only cares about amassing gold. He vigorously rejects the government's \\"request\\" for his services as an experienced military man, even though he is told by a gristled army colonel that \\"Son, we are up to our chin straps in Apaches.\\" In 1868 Carter's headlong flight from a U.S. cavalry troop leads him to a haunted cave. Moments later, in that cave, a mysterious device catapults him to another world wherein, once again, his services as a fighting man would be required.<br /><br />Let me backtrack a bit, though. I have to mention a sequence on Earth in which Carter, captured by the U.S. Army, persists in one break-out attempt after another. While this is largely played for laughs, this sequence embodies the make-up of Burroughs' heroes. John Carter, Tarzan, Carson of Venus, and others all demonstrate that never-give-up demeanor. I'm so happy they put this sequence in. And it was pretty funny.<br /><br />There's another fun segment soon after he lands On Mars (or \\"Barsoom\\") in which John Carter learns of the enhanced abilities bestowed him by the planet's lower gravity. Even more than his sudden colossal strength, it's Carter's newfound ability to leap prodigiously that captured my imagination as a kid. There were three things I was anxious to see going into this film, and the film has visualized them marvelously. There's the geek-out thrill of finally seeing the incomparable Dejah Thoris fleshed out. There are the 12-foot-tall Tharks convincingly brought to life. And there are John Carter's astounding leaps. That's levitation, homes. I guess you could throw in the awesome monster dog, Woola, as well.<br /><br />On the barren, war-ravaged wastelands of Barsoom, a Thark's curiousity saves John Carter. Tharks, like most of the planet's indigenous lifeforms, are six-limbed creatures. Tharks are tusked, green-skinned barbarians noted for their savagery and contempt for weakness. Carter is captured by Tharks, his life spared by Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe), a Jeddak (king or leader) who secretly nurses a bump of compassion. Tars Tarkas is like a delighted little kid, wanting to show off Carter's sensational leaps. And you can't blame Tars Tarkas. There's just something joyous in Carter's defiance of gravity. It buys Carter some time.<br /><br />The film's neat retro sci-fi vibe surfaces early on when the narrative introduces the war between the invading forces of the Zodanga empire and the beleaguered city of Helium, touted as the last bastion of a free Barsoom. I soaked in the wonderful set designs and those wicked cool airships. And, somewhere hereabouts, we meet Dejah Thoris. Wonderfully portrayed by Lynn Collins, Dejah Thoris is presented as a fierce warrior-scientist of Helium, as well as its beloved princess. Except that, rather than wed Sab Than (Dominic West), leader of the encroaching Zodanga army, Dejah Thoris runs away.<br /><br />I guess I could roll with the changes the filmmakers made. It's not astral projection but, rather, an ornament of either magical nature or super-science which hurls Carter to Barsoom. Matai Shang (Mark Strong), who doesn't appear until THE GODS OF MARS, does have presence as the overarcing big bad. The film makes him and his fellow Therns more as immortal, shape-shifting interplanetary manipulators than Barsoom's more localized secret rulers. It'll take more than fancy jumping to foil Matai Shang's machinations. It'll probably take a trilogy of movies.<br /><br />My friend, who hadn't ever read ERB, thought the film just so-so. He remarked that it was full of plot cliches culled from other movies like STAR WARS and AVATAR and such. I had to smack him upside the head and tell him that A PRINCESS OF MARS came out way before those movies. To me, JOHN CARTER is a welcome throwback, a good old-fashioned pulp adventure featuring a hero who, for a change, isn't dark or gritty or cynical (okay, Carter starts out a bit cynical). While Taylor Kitsch doesn't quite capture John Carter's gravitas and inherent nobility, he's sold me with what he brings to the table, a terrific physicality and just enough dramatic weight. Lynn Collins, to me, is more of a revelation. I love her interpretation of Dejah Thoris, the resolve she infuses in her role. I love her looks which are exotic enough that I believed she was an otherworldy princess. That Collins is a black belt in Shito-ryu karate makes her that much hotter. That right there should make her a match for a fighting Virginian battling his way across the breadth of the red planet. Somewhere along the way, inter mundos, John Carter had found a cause.tempt for weakness.

B000063DI9|4.0|After Powerslvae, they went a more progressive direction. Seventh Son and Somewhere in Time shows some maturity in their music. The songs aren't as fast and heavy, the band changes and moves forward. They added synthesizer into their music and it made it more unique. It's still heavy metal but not as heavy as their older music and has progressive influences. I really enjoy their 4 latest albums but Seventh Son is their last truly amazing CD.

B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I bought this one because I've been a lifelong fan of King's work and a sucker for anything about time travel. It wasn't what I expected: the anticipated time travel thriller with political overtones gently morphed into one of the most fascinating and tender romances I have ever read. Brilliant. This is King at his very best.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I really liked the first Bourne film, The Bourne Identity. Bourne Supremacy was decent but nowhere near the first film. Bourne Ultimatum is great and one of my favorite films of all time. I'd recommend watch the first 2 before this because you won't understand the plot as well. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon)eludes Moscow police and goes into hiding after being shot by Russian FSB agent Kirill (in The Bourne Supremacy). Six weeks later, The Guardian Security Correspondent Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) meets with a source to discuss Bourne and Operation Treadstone. It's overall, the most intense of the series and has the best plot in my opinion.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|I had only heard \\"We Are Young\\" and a few of fun.'s other older songs before ordering this album.  I was so pleasantly surprised upon listening to just the first two tracks that I searched for tickets to fun.'s sold out show in my city next month and paid triple the ticket price to go.<br /><br />This album is unbelievable.  I love it.  My friends love it.  Even my mom loves it.<br /><br />Pop artists should learn from this album that pop music can still be catchy and hook-filled without sacrificing substance.  With this album, fun. has bridged that connection between pop music and good music that only a few artists have done successfully, especially in recent years.  And I couldn't be happier to get to experience that connection.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Special effects were incredible.  Acting was mediocre.  The storyline was very strong!  I was super-impressed by this movie.  I did not expect much at all.  Probably the best CGI special effects I have ever seen in a movie.
B00170DEM8|5.0|This film, which was the jumping off point for the much later White Christmas (another great holiday film), is a great film to watch on any of the holidays featured in it and is unique for the pairing of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, both at the top of their game...

B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo<br /><br />First I must say that this book was nothing like I thought it would be. lol I guess I should learn to read more than just the title. However, I must say that I loved this book and I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.<br /><br />There were a few parts to this book that were a bit disturbing to me but the book kept changing things up and didn't drag things out so it kept me going. I do have to mention that  when I was reading the first chapter I didn't know if I was going to be able to read it or not but after I started the second chapter it had me and and I hated putting it down.<br /><br />I loved the role that Salander had, and I did learn some about how those darn hackers can get into your computers. And that Blomkvist, he was a very determined man that sometimes go the raw end of the deal. I wish that I had the ability that Salander had.<br /><br />Next for me, is to watch the movie!<br /><br />You can see my complete review at: [...]
0439023483|5.0|This was a great novel. The story moves along at such a pace that you just can't seem to stop. I love that no matter what is going on with the violent themes that it never stops being a good story about three dimensional characters.<br /><br />This is a love story that I can get behind. In most sci-fi fantasy books the love story just gets tacked on. Not so here. All of the elements fit so well together.<br /><br />The greatest achievement that this book has going for it is that at no time is the satire not present. You can just sit back and enjoy the story. But if you want to there are many deep themes being mulled over in this book.<br /><br />First person narrative isn't usually my favorite but the author really pulled it off for this one. This is a great book that has enough of everything to please just about anybody. All the parts work with little filler. Buy this book.
B003QO8TDC|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, back in the 80's, I was just beginning to realize my own great dream.  I was just beginning to succeed at doing what I had wanted to do since childhood.  Unfortunately, someone in my life at that time was equally dedicated to derailing that dream, so it didn't happen.  The dream, and the opportunity to achieve it, were lost. Sad, yes. But hopeless, no.<br /><br />This fantastic, energizing movie makes  me even more determined to see that my children and my grandchildren have every opportunity to achieve their own dreams.  I have and will continue to cheer and do whatever it takes to help them along the way.<br /><br />This wonderful movie is too full of hope and joy and drive to allow anyone to sit and mourn the loss of their own dream.  Pick up the pieces, move on, and help the ones you love - and share their joy when they reach for their own stars!<br /><br />I like to identify with old Hannah in the film.  One is never quite sure how much of her own dream she achieved, but she is able to reach across the generations to nurture and encourage the talent she sees in young Alex.  Can there be a better legacy than that?
B000JMLFLW|5.0|My husband purchased my Kindle for me for Christmas.  I was a little skeptical; I love holding my books. My son showed me how to purchase books on Amazon for my Kindle and off I went.  There is no turning back now; LOVE MY KINDLE and LOVE that I purchased Pride and Prejudice for it!  The writer, Jane Austin really knows her stuff and knows how to capture a reader! I would reccomend this book highly!!
0525422943|5.0|I'll admit that I was incredibly hesitant to read Where She Went after finishing If I Stay.  In my opinion, If I Stay didn't need a sequel.  Although it was a bit of a cliffhanger ending, I was happy with the way things turned out.<br />Needless to say, I enjoyed Where She Went so much.<br />*SPOILERS FOR IF I STAY*<br />After Mia made the choice to live, she went off to college at Julliard.  Adam stayed with Shooting Star.  Inevitably, the two grew apart.  This made for a depressing story line as I was rooting for Mia and Adam all throughout If I Stay.<br />I wasn't expecting it, but this book made me cry nearly as much as If I Stay had.  The heartbreak that Adam was experiencing was so powerful and real.<br />Like If I Stay, I never knew how this book was going to end.  I knew how I wanted it to end and even started to become annoyed with Mia and Adam for beating around the bush.  However, their journey was inevitably worth it.<br />In Where She Went, the author seamlessly switches between past and present.  One chapter will be told in the present and the next will be a story from the past.  However, they never seem disjointed.<br />Despite my hesitations I am so grateful that I read this book. I would absolutely recommend it.  It is a must read for those who read If I Stay.

B005SFS4ZU|1.0|This review is very useful only for brazilians. The Phanton of the Opera is as much about music as about poetry, as the lyrics of wonderful songs such as \\"Music of the Night\\", \\"Angel of Music\\" and \\"Wishing you were somehow here again\\" could be stand alone poetry.  These wonderful lyrics however, as well as most of the lyrics in this video, is completely overlooked on a terrible, disgusting translation in the portuguese subtitles.  I dare to say that a brazilian who has never seen The Phanton of the Opera before will miss all the magic this wonderful musical is all about if he/she depends on the subtitle for understanding the plot. Many times during the show, the text in the subtitle is so absurdly wrong that it changes completely the meaning of the lyrics. It is like you are watching a completely different story sometimes. I heard the wrong texts in the portuguese subtitles in this video have been taken from the brazilian production of The Phanton of the Opera as performed in the \\"Teatro Abril\\" in São Paulo until 2008. I could never understand why the phanton in Brazil was in portuguese anyway (please gentleman, operas and musicals should never be presented in a language other than the original language anywhere, since the sounds of the words are part of the music itself). It is a pitty, because brazilians who have only seen the Phanton in the Teatro Abril in São Paulo, and on this DVD/BluRay, with the completely wrong portuguese-translation, will never know what the wonderful The Phanton of the Operas is all about.
014241543X|5.0|If I Stay by Gayle Forman was recommended to me by a friend and I am so grateful that it was.  This was one of the most powerful and well-written books I have ever read.<br />The story focuses on Mia's decision.  She must choose whether to live without her family or die along with them.  It's a terrible decision.  As Mia's body lies in the hospital, hooked up to breathing tubes and more, some part of her is conscious to what is going on around her.  She watches her grandmother, grandfather, boyfriend and best friend visit her and speak with her.<br />The most fascinating part of the story, for me, was the author's amazing ability to weave the past and present tense together so effortlessly.  There are almost two stories happening simultaneously.<br />I would absolutely recommend this book.  It moved me to tears multiple times but was also fascinating.  I could hardly put it down.  What Mia would choose was never obvious.<br />One of my favorite books.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone to read.  Zoey the main character is just so much like any normal person that you can relate to her, and all of her friends she makes at The House Of Night.  This is just a really good series and as you read along it gets more and more interesting with several twists, and it keeps you on your toes.
0786852550|5.0|\\"The effect was immediate.  The charge left me, I slumped to the ground.  Small lightning bolts shot off in all directions.  The boy dived just in time - an electric charge that would have killed him beautifully speared straight through his flailing coat as he hit the floor.  Other bolts collided with his bed and desk; one zapped into his vase of flowers, slicing the glass cleanly in two.  I gave him a friendly thumbs-up.  \\"Keep going,\\" I (Bartimaeus) grinned.  \\"One day, if you work hard and stop making all these stupid mistakes you might make a real grown-up wizard.\\"  This quote is from the first book in the Bartimaeus Trilogy, called The Amulet Of Samarkand.  The story revolves around two main characters, Bartimaeus, a dijinni, and Nathaniel, an orphan who becomes apprenticed to the magician Mr. Underwood.  As an apprentice, Nathaniel learns scholarly arts and magic.  The initial conflict begins when Nathaniel goes to a party with his master and is humiliated by a young, but ambitious magician named Simon Lovelace.  Embarrassed and hurt, Nathaniel spends years plotting revenge.  To help carry out his vengeance, Nathaniel summons a dijinni named Bartimaeus, the other main character of the story.  Caught up in his revenge, Nathaniel becomes entrenched in a plot of stealing b and murder.  Overall, The Amulet of Samarkand is an extremely well crafted book that all should read.<br />As you read the book, be aware of the character and time shifts.  There isn't just one main character narrating the story.  Every chapter or so the plot shifts from Nathaniel to Bartimaeus.  This can be confusing because sometimes Bartimaeus starts describing Nathaniel as \\"master\\" or \\"he\\".  Then on the next page, Nathaniel talks about the same situation in first person, making it confusing.  There also are flashbacks, which reveal various parts of Nathaniel's story.<br />This book is appealing because it is not a conventional wizard and wand fantasy book.  Magicians have a very special, yetdangerous way to get their powers because they have to be a slave owner.  Unlike the wizards in Harry Potter who need wands, the magicians in this story get power through various magical creatures including goblins, imps, demons, and dijinn.  These creatures cannot be seen by regular humans, but the wizards can see them.  Most just appear as rats or other various animals.  The magicians summon these demons and make them into slaves that do their bidding. However, summoning or interacting with these creatures can be deadly.  Summoning these demons comes at a price, a consequence that can easily leave magicians dead if they make a mistake.  The power that the magicians get goes by the old proverb, \\"There is no such thing as a free gift.  Everything comes with a price.\\"  One of the reasons that this book is so intriguing is to see how the main character deals with this consequence.  However, I don't want to spoil the book so read it if you are interested.  This isn't the only good aspect of this book.  The writing style was also very good.<br />Among other good things, the author use imagery and other writing tools.  There were very vivid descriptions, like the one shown in the quote above.  There were sensory details so it was almost as if I was there alongside Nathaniel, and the plot development was very exciting, almost constantly keeping me on the edge of my seat. There was suspense and mystery that just added more to the book.  The book was action packed and fast paced, just the kind that I like.<br />In addition, the magical society was very realistic. For one thing, wizards that have more power than others (including other wizards and commoners) are often corrupt and very paranoid.  In this society, magician rebellions are common and people will do almost anything to move up in the magical society.  This is much like today's system of politics and is true anywhere around the world.  In America there is the 99% versus the 1%, and the 1% are prevailing.  The quote \\"Power corrupts and absolutely power corrupts absolutely,\\" fits the situation and setting of this book. The main character tries to carry out childish revenge and in the process, he makes many enemies that could hurt him and he has to try and survive; a dwarf in a world of giants.<br />The prevailing theme in this story is a common one: persevere till the end.  Nathaniel has dreams of revenge and then of power.  He has big dreams.  However, his master holds him back by making him only do menial tasks and small summonings.  Even when all hope is lost and he has no chance he still fights with all he has for his dreams.  This theme of never giving up is shown time and time again whether it is Nathaniel or even the antagonist, Simon Lovelace, who wants to become more powerful, at the expense of many lives.<br />Overall, this book was very good.  It was a fast paced action packed book, with a realistic society, interesting magical creatures, and great writing.  Now one might say, \\"I read action packed fantasy books all of the time. What is so different about this one?\\"  The main difference is that the author blends all of these aspects into one great book that leaves you left reaching for the next one.  If that isn't enough for you this book isn't your typical, book where the hero starts out as a hero with great powers or starts out with lots of luck.  In this book the main character has to try to climb his way up from the bottom to the top. All in all this is a great book and I recommend that everyone reads it.

B004LWZW8I|1.0|Same old Greek hero searches for magical \\"whatever\\" with help of the gods and while fighting an evil personage, also in search of the same magical \\"whatever\\", has been told in film for countless decades. Unfortunately the only thing that rescues this amongst the previous 100 identical renditions is that the CGI was a bit better than any of it's look-a-likes made but only prior to the '60s. Now that I think about it the green screen sets also looked cheap. Acting and dialogue were Saturday morning cartoon boring. Action scenes of a couple of sword and spear fights were as creative as mass produced store bought cookies - bland.

1593272839|5.0|Lipovaca explains why Haskell doesn't let you change `variable' values: `You also can't set a variable to something and then set it to something else later. If you say that a is 5, you can't say it's something else later because you just said it was 5. What are you, some kind of liar?' Funny, and it gets the point across better than saying `referential transparency'.<br /><br />The book is filled with little bits of humour like that, including zany-looking drawings that actually communicate the concepts very effectively. Some advanced stuff is tackled (applicative functors, monads, zippers), yet at no point do you feel overwhelmed. I just wish there was more content like chapter 10, `Functionally Solving Problems', but maybe that's covered by [[ASIN:0596514980 Real World Haskell]] (I don't know, I haven't read that one yet). In `Functionally Solving Problems', Lipovaca presents a couple of examples where he decomposes the main problem into little, easy-to-solve mini-problems, and fits the pieces back together to solve the main problem. Awesome.<br /><br />Some `Aha!' moments for me where when he showed the quicksort algorithm implemented in Haskell; a binary tree data structure implemented in one line of code; and understanding applicative functors and the applicative style.<br /><br />Eagerly looking forward to the sequel--if he's planning one--there's a lot of exciting stuff going on in the Haskell world and this book is the perfect gateway into it.<br /><br />NOTE: The Latin character `small letter c with caron' isn't showing up in this review's sanitised preview: does Amazon not support Unicode, maybe? Anyway, I'm just using the letter c.
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|The opening graphics came close to having that Rango quality and feel but rapidly declined from that point onward. Probably because they either couldn't sustain the creative energy or they saw how expensive it is to sustain that level. The script tried to mix in too many fairy tales and ended up making them all mediocre and shallow. Good egg, bad egg was just as bland in CGI as it was in character. The gosling laying huge gold eggs in massive numbers besides seeming weird would certainly be a neat biological trick for a baby goose. Add all that high density gold and you have a golden egg laying goose that didn't visually make sense. Also,<br />ho-hum predictable was the stereotyped feline love interest. Character voice choices were OK but then they are well practiced at that by now. Finally, the humor and dialogue sounded Saturday morning cartoon bland. It all sounded like the script people simply used the decades old Disney guide book \\"Jokes for Dummies\\".
0439023491|5.0|This is a great sequel to \\"The Hunger Games\\".  It's got that same \\"riveting, can't stop reading it\\" magic that the first book had...and quite the cliffhanger ending!  The Hardcover edition is great quality at a great price.  Thoroughly recommend this book!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|This item is great! I'm not a diehard fan but I wanted the whole set of movies so that when my niece finishes the books we can watch the movies in order. It is a great price for just the basic movies (dvds are just repackaged singles) that would've cost double had I bought them all separately. If you are looking for a ton of extras, behind-the-scenes, etc this is not the right product for you but if you are just looking at having the movies on your shelf for future Harry Potter weekend marathons... it is perfect! The only reason I did not give this a 5-star rating is that the case is pretty flimsy and the plastic pieces on the inside that holds the movies in place broke about 30 seconds after I opened it.

0385344228|2.0|I read a review that compared this book to \\"Presumed Innocent\\" by Turrow but I was immediately reminded of the book, Before and After\\", 1992, by Rosellen Brown.  The premise, son of educated, affluent parents accused of murder is the same, the accused even have the same name, Jacob. The parents suffer the same guilt and fears and both fathers dispose of the possible murder weapons, both victims have tortured small dogs. The introduction of the \\"mob\\" character was a nice touch and a believable resolution. I found the format of the grand jury questioning intrusive and at times confusing. I thought the mother's naivete hard to understand in light of her childhood and her concern with blame offputting and unrealistic. The father seemed like a bit of a loose cannon and he seemed to relate to his son only when he remembered him as a baby. The parents bickering in front of the doctor and lawyers was very much out of character and I didn't much like any one in the family.  The ending, with the mother attempting to kill the child who has a \\"murder gene\\" is the same as that in the movie \\"The Bad Seed\\". This story also focused on inheritance as a possible explanation for unacceptable<br />behavior. I don't recommend it.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|\\"Gran Torino\\" is a remarkable film that is difficult to characterize.  Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War veteran who, after seeing combat in Korea, worked on the Ford assembly lines until he retired.  His particular neighborhood has slowly become predominately Vietnamese, and this culture at first neither appeals to him any more than his new neighbors understand him.  Slowly, however, each side comes to appreciate the virtues of the other and therein lies a humorous but also poignant storyline.  Clint Eastwood turns in his usual stellar job as the grouchy, politically-incorrect \\"Walt\\".  The big surprise here is that the mostly unknown Vietnamese cast is extremely good and they turn in excellent performances as well.<br /><br />There are some ethnic slurs in this film and normally I do not approve of such.  Perhaps the film could have dispensed with this, but who am I to second-guess Clint Eastwood?  In my opinion this film may be forgiven that, because in the context of this film it is a legitimate device to bring the viewer to the ultimate message of the film, which is one of mutual respect and ultimately, friendship.  Recommended.  RJB.
B001KZVQJI|3.0|There are plenty of reviews of the movie itself already, so I won't bother other than to say that I think Jackson did an excellent job of remaking the classic movie.<br /><br />I think I would have given the release at least one more star, if not two, if only they had released it with all the extras on the [[ASIN:B000H30B2C King Kong - Extended Cut (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)]] DVD version.  The only real extra on this disk is the excellent commentary by Jackson and Boyens.  All the other extras, documentaries and featurettes are missing from this (or any) BD.  This is particularly annoying when the director brings something up in the commentary but then says \\"we won't go into that now, as we covered it in the documentary\\".  I'm a huge fan of both his movies and the extras Jackson has included in other releases, but I'm not about to buy the DVD version of the film just to get them, when I already have the BD.<br /><br />As its been several years since the original BD was released, I can only assume no ultimate edition of the movie is coming, so I'll never see the extras the DVD buyers got.  Thanks for sticking it to the consumers once again, Universal.
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|I really loved this book. I am majoring in computer science so it is really helpful. If you want to learn the code it's worth it! It is very exciting to create webpages and publish them. It's something I plan on doing in the future.
B001KQEE0U|3.0|Tupac did not get the love that he gets now while his career was blowing up...a true poet, who expresses feelings not seen in most rappers or poets.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|It drags a lot.  Starts off interesting, but then gets mired down in detail.  Still trying to muscle through it.
B005QUQRE2|1.0|If you want 90 minutes of watching a supposedly \\"brilliant\\" young woman wallow in self-pity, with virtually no true character development at all, then this film is for you.  Characters are supposed to grow and develop, yet this protagonist is about as flat as any I've ever seen--I've seen much better character development in Looney Tunes cartoons.  The thinnest of plots holds things together just barely, and the \\"other earth\\" idea is more of a plot device than an integral part of the plot; it's like bait and switch advertising--simply a pretext to get you to watch, then they never deliver on the goods.<br /><br />There are some interesting ideas in the film, but the script and direction both are among the poorest I've ever seen in a movie.  We were ready to give up after 30 minutes, when we both said \\"This is really tedious,\\" but we decided to hang on to see if it got better.  It didn't.  For some reason, the filmmakers thought that constantly lingering on the main character, holding shots long after their effectiveness died, was an effective method of storytelling.  It isn't.  And the lack of dialogue is terrible--Rhoda doesn't say anything to anyone (except for what's-his-name) except for a word or two.  And sleeping with him before telling him who she is?  Completely contrived and very silly.  It all leads only to one of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, with no conflict resolution at all, just a hackneyed appearance of a new character.  If she's at all as boring and annoying as the Rhoda we've seen in this film, then it's a good thing the movie ends when it does.  This was a monumentous waste of time.
B007BLDFWG|2.0|She's an amazing actress...gives substance to the vacant Olsen name. Regretfully, there is zero resolution in the movie, and may leave you a bit hollow at the end.

B003Y5HWMW|1.0|I've been fighting the blu-rays for over two hours... I won't even load a title screen.  Updated by blu-ray driver just before inserting the discs and nothing happens.  Takes about 20 minutes to get to a black screen with a menu at the top.  Drop to the Episodes and they won't load.  What a piece of junk.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you are a fan of George Orwell's 1984 and/or Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451, you're gonna love this book.  Don't let the book covers fool you, this is a classic.  I am going to review the trilogy as a whole.  You could perhaps read the first in the series as a stand-alone but don't: the books function as one.  This is a coming of age story... during times and circumstances that are determined to stunt.  To say that Katniss, the lead character, is strong is an understatement.  Albeit young, she has the uncanny ability to unapologetically do what she must in order to survive.  But she isn't simple. Her emotions and thoughts are complex even though there is little time to explore either.  Dreaming, loving, even eating are luxuries that can rarely be afforded.  As the story progresses, familiar themes are revealed: the effects of power; a controlling, privileged class; \\"bread and circus\\"; fear of revolt; strength intermingled with the ultimate vulnerability.<br /><br />Katniss lives in a country called Panem, land that remains of what we currently know as North America.  It is divided into 12 Districts, each one with its unique resources and regulations; and all of which are controlled, in order to feed the construct, of the Capitol.  The Hunger Games are debatably the most vicious form of control because it openly attacks the young - symbols of a future that cannot be counted on.<br /><br />Through Katniss's eyes, we gradually learn more about this country and the people in it.  It's not an easy journey.  In fact, it is downright painful when you - as an experienced adult, in my case - see something that Katniss can't quite conceptualize.  She is young and therefore, naive.  And you feel for her because in an ideal world, naivete would not come at such a high cost.  I cannot say enough about this book but I don't like giving too much away.  So, if you are on Kindle, please order the free sample.  It will be immediately obvious to you if these books are for you.  And Ihope they are.  Enjoy!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is the story of a soldier putting his country before all else. It also is indicative of how the useless politicians, bureaucrats, biased media & rear echelon generals can screw things up at the expense of good soldiers lives & americas best interests. War is hell & you must fight your enemy with every ounce of will & firepower at your command. Once we've kicked the crap out of him, he'll cry uncle. If not, he dies. Case closed. American Sniper is an excellent guide for how to fight the terrorists of today. Give our boys the means to do it, send them off to get it done, shut the hell up about how they accomplish it. If we're not going to do it right, we should'nt get involved at all. Those do-nothing pussy politicians in Washington need to tear up their home spun ROE's & let our guys to their jobs.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Adele is my favorite female artist. In my opinion she has the most beautiful voice a woman her age could be given. When I first heard her sing I thought the person who is singing has to be at least 30 for a voice to sound like this. To be only 19 when recording these songs is remarkable. I didn't like this album as much as 21 but it's still worth many a listen.

B005URRCUY|3.0|Attack and Release was decent... not as great as their earlier albums or even Brothers. Brothers was a good return to their roots, but was a bit depressing since the Black Keys did not sound like a two-piece band anymore. Then El Camino was released. My first listen I was like \\"Wow, this is good!\\" But as I listened to the album more, I realized the album did not sound like the Black Keys we all know and love. Firstly, there are way too many instruments playing at once. The album sounds like a wall of sound, not very attractive.<br /><br />Secondly, all of the songs (except Little Black Submarine, which is one of the greatest Black Keys songs) focus way too much on the chorus. The verses are short, but then we have this chorus (which are always backed by female vocalists, which gets repetitive) that drags the song out way too long.<br /><br /> Lastly, WHERE IS THE BLUES??? There is not one song on this album that leaves a hint that shows the Black Keys are (were??) a blues band. What's even more depressing is that the guitar is sent to the back in most of the songs, which leaves the songs based around synth, bass, and drums. This is so weird, since on Brothers, EVERY SINGLE SONG was blues and soul-filled. If I had never heard of the Black Keys, and someone had played El Camino and Thickfreakness side-by-side, I would not guess that they were the same band (except by Dan's voice, of course).<br /><br />Now who's to blame here? I personally think Danger Mouse is the culprit in this situation. I think that he is trying to hard to make the Black Keys sound like the old Black Keys, which, ironically, makes the Black Keys sound less like the old Black Keys.<br /><br />What's the solution, you ask? I say let someone else produce the next album. Being that Attack and Release and El Camino (both produced by Danger Mouse) are basically the only sore thumbs in the Black Keys discography, that can't just be coincidence, right? I'm glad the Black Keys have finally risen in fame,but I really hope they go back to their roots. If they don't, however, I think we should all be happy that we have a great [past] discography from them, since most bands tend to lose \\"it\\" after two or three albums.<br /><br />PS El Camino is in no way a \\"bad\\" album, it's just bad by Black Keys standards. Cheers.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|An amazing compilation of characters and plotlines.  I found some of the storylines<br />a little disjointed by book 2/3.  You want to know what happened to certain characters,<br />but they don't show back up right away and I felt disjointed trying to follow where<br />they ended up and why.<br />Overall a captivating read
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the book.  Hooks you from beginning and is riviting to the end. Read it in just one sitting. Although I questioned passages interspersed throughout the book, in the end it all makes sense.

0761169253|5.0|I stumbled over this book by accident yesterday in Nashville. I was bewildered and intrigued by the title and just bought it out of curiosity.

Not for every taste though.

0316056863|1.0|I gave this book to my daughter for Christmas then borrowed it back to read for book club.  Too bad I didn't know what a dud it would be because I would not have spent one cent on it. Tina Fey is vulgar without being funny and totally lacking in wit, warmth, or charm.  I am curious to see what others in the book club think.  I have already had a one word review from a member I ran into on the street: \\"TRASH.\\"

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I thought this was an incredible album from Drake. His aim was to tell his story and he did a great job doing that. Your usual radio-driven tracks (i.e. Make Me Proud) are sprinkled through-out but I personally enjoyed the mroe life-driven tracks (i.e. Look What You've Done) a lot more. 5/5 from me for the story-telling.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app.....a must have for your device.  I use on my kindle fire and love it!!! there is hardly any ads and that is a nice plus
B004LWZW8S|1.0|This is my 1st review ever. Being a long time a lover of Greek Mythology, after all I was born and raised in Greece, and having watched Troy and 300 which I would have rated 3.0 each, this is probably the worst attempt to capture a very significant tale. They took a few scripts and made it as boring as possible. It offends us as a nation to deal with manic depressive tendencies by the producers, completely irrelevant to amazing scripts, bringing and promoting such an atrocity as the Immortals.<br />Thank you.
B007BLDFWG|2.0|I was really excited about seeing this film, after reading so many 5-star, rave reviews from both critics and the general public.  The story and subject matter sounded very interesting, and I was expecting great things.  Unfortunately, for me, there just wasn't enough substance to the story, and the constant flashbacks were distracting.  Other than a couple of violent scenes, there was no excitement, no plot.  It just seemed like a long and pointless story about a disturbed young woman and her well-meaning sister.  In the end, we are left to wonder if she was ever able to get well and leave the demons of the past behind her.  Very little story and no clear ending....that's about all I have to say.  One more thing: Elizabeth Olsen did a fantastic job in her role, but I honestly did not find myself rooting for this character as much as I wanted to.
B002WPVNZM|4.0|This was a pretty good album by One Republic. A little bit more mellow than I would've liked, but definitely a solid album. A handful of these songs are/could be radio singles.

6304708521|5.0|Some individuals explain in detail reasons for owning this DVD and why it is indispensable, but then abruptly do U-turns, proceeding to mock and dispose of it, as if it were \\"garbage.\\" Some even label it as such. I am baffled by their explanations, some of which appear on the verge of anger - not straightforward, objective, or unemotional reviews. I don't get it. This is a fun album and film.<br /><br />This film is art imitating art, not art imitating life - that might be where they appear conflicting and lost. MMT was a low budget film and period piece, not intended for the big screen or for your everyday \\"Help!\\" connoisseurs or screaming Beatle fanatics. That said, it is still essential art and goes hand-in-hand with the psychedelic landscape of the film's backdrop and the late sixties era in general, not to mention the album chuck full of sublime classics on MMT. There will never be another \\"I Am the Walrus.\\" John Lennon even said MMT was his favorite album, \\"because it's so weird.\\" Regarding the film, not the album, Paul bouncing around those hills with \\"The Fool on the Hill,\\" playing ever so sweetly, is not merely a must-see, but a must-own. There was nothing like that at the time in 1968. Like Monty Python, MMT is very British. For me, that is exactly what makes this special film so innovative.<br /><br />It is clear some reviewers were not there and that truly makes me sad, because it was such a cool time. By being there, I mean being in the heart of the sixties rock music pop culture - in the moment, as only one could be by actually living, breathing, and soaking up the renaissance age - as this certainly was a renaissance during the height of the Beatles' symbolic writing period - \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is loaded with metaphor. Unadorned screening of the film shows through in some reviews, which indicates to me some reviews of the film were from a literal perception, which the film is not intended to be viewed.<br /><br />It bothers me that decades later some still Monday morning quarterback about the world of avant-garde, which they have neither experienced nor bathed in with all of their colorful senses, because they wear sunglasses to keep out the glare to reduce the inconvenience. Doing so, unfortunately reduces the color, too. There is something about fear of light that prevents our seeing its beauty from another perspective. This experimental art is now sadly taken out of context to be jammed into square pegs it has no business being forced into. I have never seen such limited view of beauty than I have in recent years, which permits me to spot green miles away. It is so unhip and un-cool that it startles me, because it signals to me it may be too impractical to explore art that was relevant and vital to a specific bygone era, which has now become homogenized to the extent we are slowly becoming sedated and numb to where we can no longer feel comfortable with it. We are moving away from allowing the art to flow in, as intended.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy this DVD and hold onto it dearly. Yes, it may be unusual. It may be bizarre. But, it is Magical and no mystery to me. It is the Beatles outdoing themselves once again with yet another unpredictable feat in their impressive and illustrious career of incredible music and yes, film!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|As a teacher and aspiring writer, I needed something as User friendly as could be.  I found it.  I have enjoyed this app so far, using it in class with my school-issued laptop.  Anyone who had issues with this app was possibly working with an older out-dated version.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|WOW!! As a long time VH fan like so many other reviewers, i had to pick this cd up the day it was released. At 40 yrs old when was the last time in recent years that any new cd has inspired me to do that?? Most music today sucks balls but this new VH effort kicks the listener in the balls. Ok Ok, tatoo is an obvious attempt at radio friendliness but get past that and you have a cd full of rockers. Vintage DLR vocals, very strong without the signature scream, and eddie's guitar work reminds one that he is back and ready to take his best guitarist crown back. The suprise here is Wolfie's bass work, far better than on the 2008 VH tour. Every song is rockin greatness as the boys prove that 60 yr old dudes rock better than any younger bands out there today who rely on power barre chords with not much skill.  Go get this now!!!
B005M5NDCA|3.0|Solid performance from a debut artist. Good, not great song choices but they were done well.It is though, worth buying and worth a listen.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|The complexity and vivid violence makes this an adult fantasy. Each character is multi-dimensional with different degrees of light and dark.  I thought he killed my favorite character (the tomboy) off and was so glad when a chapter for her popped up (sorry for the spoiler).  No one character is the protagonist and some of the villains will surprise you. But I can guarantee you will be happy when your favorite characters have the next chapter. It's addictive and I will enjoy my second read even more because I'll understand the locations and family relationships.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|just sayin'. I use it on my Kindle Fire, whether I'm doing devotions, reading along with a speaker of sermon, planning a sermon on my own, etc. great stuff.

B003O86FMW|4.0|The story is one of survival based on selfless decision by the heroine of the story who makes the lives of family and friends her primary purpose for winning the games.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is now one of my favourite books of all time. I was fascinated by the content and enjoyed the writing style.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I agree with previous reviews. I have a kindle fire and it works great. looking forward to unlocking more levels, which doesn't seem to hard to do
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I read this book when I borrowed it from a friend.  But how awesome to have my own copy, at my disposal, on my Kendle cloud reader to my computer and to my phone. I can read it anytime and I may have to again before Breaking Dawn Part II this Fall.  Awesome
1455510319|5.0|Great book, I absolutely recommend it! It has a twist and a surprise ending. I like the effortless language.<br />Just as good as the Lincoln Lawyer, would be another great movie
B005VTS4EY|5.0|i liked it it was cool and fun but a times its hard to figure out what to do. i would buy it
B006022WW6|5.0|This tv series keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. You truly cant wait to see next weeks show.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very handy app.like that it shows up on the corner of the screen at all times. does not slow down phone.
B001C46P2K|4.0|Young Victoria is a great example of fine british work. The actors do a great job of portraying historical characters, and from what I can tell they stick pretty close to reality. Fall in love with Both young Victoria and young Albert as you see the royal and the human side of life.  You will watch it more than once if you are a british film lover.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I so enjoy using YouVersion. I have on both my phone and fire kindle. Especially using the option to share on facebook,email and text.@:)
0545265355|5.0|Unlike others who had to wait for the next portion of this story to be told, I bought these books--The hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mocking jay--as a set and read them one after the other.  Accordingly, I will review the series as if it were a single 1,145 page book.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' imagination and ability to mesmerize the reader with this fantasy is unprecedented by any series that I have ever read.  Completely absorbed, I literally saw this action-packed drama unfold in my mind.  I was completely engrossed from beginning to end.<br /><br />The reader will get to know many of the author's fully developed characters and may develop an emotional attachment and sense of loss as many of them do not survive.<br /><br />The tale begins with the aftermath of the world as we know it today.  North America, now known as Panem, is organized into twelve districts, heavily controlled by the capital.  Each district contributes major resources to the capital as the unequal redistribution of necessities impact the health and livelihood of citizens.<br /><br /> Following the rebellion and inhalation of the thirteenth district some 75 years previously, the capital has established  a grim annual (Hunger Games) and special 25 year (Quarter Quell) event to keep them in line and remind them of the cost of rebellion.<br /><br />Each year on \\"reaping day\\" the capital forces each district to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the Hunger Games--a fight to the death televised live nationwide--with rules, setting and weapons established by the capital after a short training session.<br /><br />Home districts mourn theirs losses and hail the survivor as the survivor's families and district are rewarded with a more comfortable life style.<br /><br />At eleven years old, Katniss Everdeen's father was killed in a mining accident in district twelve.  Since that time she increasingly took over responsibilities as head of the household through hunting in the forbidden forest and selling excess game on the black market for other necessities.<br /><br />Sometime ago she and Gale met and became hunting partners as he provides for his two little brothers.<br /><br />When Katniss was sixteen years old, she volunteered to replace her thirteen year old sister, Primrose, who against all odds was selected to represent district twelve at the games.<br /><br />Peeta Mellark, son of a baker was selected as the other district twelve representative.  Unbeknownst to Katniss until the interview prior to the onset of the games, Peeta has secretly been in love with her for years.  This gut wrenching story flies by as this unbelievably harsh and cruel event comes to its annual conclusion only to be followed by the next.<br /><br />Unlike previous Quell Quests, two previous victors from each district are pitted against each other in a fight to the death planting seeds of rebellion that germinate throughout all the districts.  District thirteen rises from the ashes bringing a new set of events, characters and circumstances to bear.<br /><br />Growing anger, alliances and characters develop as surprising events unfold while the reader holds on for life during this rollercoaster ride of gut wrenching suspense and drama come to a head leaving Suzanne Collins my new favorite author!<br /><br />Enjoy!through hunting in the forbidden forest and selling excess game on the black market for other necessities.<br /><br />Sometime ago she and Gale met and became hunting partners as he provides for his two little brothers.<br /><br />When Katniss was sixteen years old, she volunteered to replace her thirteen year old sister, Primrose, who against all odds was selected to represent district twelve at the games.<br /><br />Peeta Mellark, son of a baker was selected as the other district twelve representative.

B005Q1W0ZQ|4.0|After watching the first season of Downton Abbey it is great to catch up with this British aristocratic family and staff as war breaks out, and so does the spanish flu.  I love the banter between the family and staff and it is easy to recognize that the staff is actually part of the family in many ways. Seeing social lines blurred by the war and permanently changed afterwards is fascinating. The characters are endearing and you are left hanging for season 3. Hugh Bonneville does his usual stellar performance and Maggie Smith gets more lovable by the episode.
B004AKCME8|3.0|Really, cramming three whole books into one movie is NOT a good idea. The movie was rushed, details were wrong, the pure ones were NOT in control of St. Aggies at the start, Kludd and Soren did NOT fall from the nest, Kludd PUSHED Soren out, when that happened in the movie, I knew I was going to regret finishing it. And I did, the only good thing about this movie is the visuals, everything else is horrible, a place that took up about two books, took up about ten minutes, which made it horrible in my opinion, everything was far too rushed.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great detail and filled with nice weather data, User friendly straight forward interface, accurate, approved by a total weather nerd.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Sci-Fi is often mixed into other genres. Action, horror, adventure. And plenty of good films continue to be made in all three. But pure thinking-man's sci-fi is a truly rare commodity, and as such Moon stands out.<br /><br />The story is simple but no less profound in its implications because it is. The cast is small but the acting superb. The film was supposedly made on a relatively small budget but it never shows.<br /><br />I'll let others speak to the plot and simply say: If you love well made science fiction films that make you think you'll love Moon.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|I loved the barnyard goings-on of the animals, and the great interaction with their human \\"masters\\"... a movie not to be missed.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|Love all the movies on 1 DVD, great value!!  Fast shipping, great packaging!!!  It was a great Christmas gift for my husband, he loved it
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I got this on Black Friday at the best rate ever! Harry Potter is one of my favorite things and I watch them often!
B001BWQVSG|5.0|This collection of piano solos is amazing both as a bargain and as a sample of Martha Argerich's pianism. She combines lyricism with a virtuosity which reminds me of a coiled spring. It is so convenient to have this boxed collection that I bought it although I already had recordings included on three of the eight discs and the duplications served as welcome presents to family music lovers. Martha Argerich must be one of the top five pianists of our time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My teenage grandson suggested that I read this trilogy - and I was so pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed the story as well as the writing style. The premise is horrifying - a world very changed from the one we know today - but we also thought Orwell's \\"1984\\" was a stretch of the imagination, and now we see parts of it in our daily lives. I am looking forward to seeing the movie version of this book.
B005QMOZOO|1.0|A very poor effort and not at all comparable to her contemporary work. Too many \\"as you knows\\", the language is inauthentic, and the second half is a dull trial with a plot error. She also yanks in characters from other Austen novels, which is silly.
B004478GN8|5.0|Not able to review as I've not given it to my grandson yet.  Altho I know he's going to be thrilled as it's one of the battle packs he's been wanting!  Sorry!
B005K17RU0|5.0|best app there its for weather, love that I have a week of data information, works great on my Droid
B000FP2OPY|5.0|No complaints about this product. There isn't anything fancy about it. It is your standard television series on DVD, which made me quite happy. I love this show.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Beautiful film,but one must watch carefully the many characters or you get lost.I was expecting something like Downton Abbey.DVD. Quality is great.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|So simple, so engrossing.  Hard to put down!  Get it!  Get it now!  Go!  What are you waiting for?  NOW!
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I can't say I'm a hard core fan but I have most of Sinead's albums and and I have to say this harkens back to the solid Sinead of the days of the first 2 albums.  Every single one of the 10 songs on this album are solidly well written gems!  I saw her in concert in LA just recently in which she played songs off this album in addition to her old classics and they seemed to flow seemlessly.  It was an amazing show that showed no signs of her personal problems that have been so well publicized.  You get songs like \\"Queen of Denmark\\"  and \\"Take off Your Shoes\\" that start slow and eventually rock out.  You get little happy celebratory songs like \\"Fourth and Vine\\".  You get vulnerable and delicate songs like \\"Reason with Me\\".
B0067R0APK|4.0|Having the temp in notification area all the time is cool and useful. Good app and I like the video forecast
B004DMIIVO|5.0|The movie is great!  Wonderful plot, great animation, and I like the music score.  At first I wasn't sure if I'd be into it that much, but it turned out to be interesting, so that's why I purchased it.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|Nice timekiller.  many of the negative reviews are over the permissions but Openfeint can't track high scores without them.  Nice puzzles to keep you entertained.  Not the next Angry Birds but fun.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|Considering Justin Timberlake had a starring role!  I would also like to add that the plot is totally believable.  I would definately watch it again.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  It was VERY entertaining and exciting.  Think they forgot it is in the future and it is just a story.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I really have not played this game, for as stated in title of review, I bought this as a gift for my sister's family at Christmas. I have read great reviews of this game--Wired magazine had a tremendous article about it a while back. Also--I've read much about this game at one of my favorite websites, The Simple Dollar, whose author has stated many times that this game is not one to pass up.
B000H0MKO2|5.0|This is a great movie!  It only cost me $.98. I used parts of it in in a college business class to make students think about the role of advertising, spin, and spin doctors in our society.  I received it in good condition promptly after ordering.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is awesome. More than that, teamlava games is awesome. I like how they made fashion story, city story and everything else, because even though they are copies of each other, you can choose any theme you like or maybe just all of them!
B007IQX1G4|5.0|This movie shows how most of the cool kids really felt inside which is empty so they had to down others to help their self-esteem its sad. Someone so beautiful on the outside could be so messed up on the inside.  Theron plays this role well.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I found this game to be challenging and fun.  Some levels require a little more thinking to solve and some require a little more skill.  It is one of the few that will remain on my kindle fire.  you will enjoy it.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Every time I have tried to download this app I get someone elses game. Teamlava is no help. I can't download any of their games and get my own game.
B001TH8UUA|2.0|Purchased 3 of these for a new flat panel TV. Each of these cables was in a wall and safe from harm. Never the less, in the space of one year, two of the cables failed (started showing horizontal lines and flashing white). I replaced them with slightly more expensive cables and hope that those do not fail.  As for the one remaining, I am just waiting for the time where it to fails.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Author offers some interesting and informative background on an event that has not received much attention. The development of the key characters never really is accomplished, so while there's empathy for them, the reader doesn't come away with an important connection. A missed opportunity in my view. I will read another of her books and see how I feel.
B003UESJF6|4.0|This is a great movie.  I think it is hillarious and teaches good lessons.  I would recommend to anyone that wants a good laugh.
B000063DFQ|5.0|I still like to pull out Piece of Mind once and a while and give it a spin on the turntable. This is my favorite Maiden album by far it just rocks and the album has a great flow to it. I can also get it in between one of my many beloved Saxon cds and not disrupt the style and mood of one of my all time favorite metal bands.<br /><br />  This is certainly a number 1 buy by Iron Maiden hands down.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|There is no top 40 crap here. I like the tracks, even though there is not one single overpowering track that the takes stage.  Being a fan from way back my hopes were high for this album.  I will not say that I am dissapionted, but I will say that these guys were able of preforming at much higher level.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the app but can't figure out how to download an &quot;offline&quot; version.  I can't use this in church because it requires a wifi connection and my church has limited connectivity.  I would like it better if I could use it offline.
B003L77GGA|5.0|Season 10 was a great way to end the series. The 2 hour finale was terrific but I would have liked to have seen more heroes from earlier seasons in the finale. It is interesting to see how the actors have changed over the 10 years. Darksied was the perfect villian for the final season.
B00447G29S|5.0|This is a movie for children of all ages.  The grandkids love to sit and watch this movie.  They watch the whole thing without getting up to do something else or just wander around.  If we want to keep them quiet for awhile, just put this movie on and instant quiet.  I heartliy recommend this movie.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|I thought it was good even if most professional reviewers hated it. Very exciting movie. I left the theatre saying it was better than the Bourne movies. The script is pretty tight and the acting is good.
B005O7PSRO|5.0|As a genre fan and follower of the series. Hollywood has always been fascinated with the publics response to the magic between people. Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn were a dueling par in many movies were a male and female leads gave the audience the kind of relationship they look for in life and can only find on screen. Castle series with the detective Becket and writer Castle has dawned unto the small screen as a captivating par solving crimes and facing lives challenges with brains, hearts, and passion only to be frustrated by reality and politics. A smart show with a lot of history behind the characters to drive the epoch and of course enough crime to always keep them busy.<br /><br />This episode is based on the aftermath of the hidden story behind Kate Beckett's personal story. Having been mortally shot, she rises to a new challenge internally and externally as she faces an office with a new boss, and mixed emotions over Castle's poorly timed but passionate confession. Castle on the other hand must wrestle with bigger demons as he realizes the catastrophe she overcame is but a sign that the enemy is far bigger and more powerful than first envisioned. Brilliantly, Castle chooses to create a plot twist to approach the problem from the sides as opposed to Beckett's more direct and often violent approach.<br /><br />The greatest treat of this series is the dance of criss crossing roles between Castle and Beckett. The unwittingly swap roles and play off each other as though they are unaware of the exchange. Yet the frequency and seamless nature of it is clearly well directed, the absence of human errors and inadvertent toe stepping, suggests that these two characters are intended to be a match made in Heaven as best planned by Hollywood.<br /><br />It is now predictable that the two characters love affair will tragically fail as Castle has one fatal flaw born from his Mother's persona and presence that stipulates a single mindedness toward living one's lifehis way at the sacrifice of any enduring love that may or may not come a long. How this is addressed will determined whether or not this series whose first 4 seasons are exceptional may well become the pinnacle romance thriller or just another good story.<br /><br />Great Stuff,
