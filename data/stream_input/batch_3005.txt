B007MDB71O|5.0|Having read the book many years ago I still remember much of it. It was pretty cool to see the world come alive. This book itself<br />had influenced many other movies and books  the movie made me want to read the whole series all over again for the fun of it. Myself and my girlfriend have watched it many times over and it was the most watched movie in the house for several months. She was quite surprised she actually liked the movie as much as she did after the reviews. It is now one of her top 10 movies. The blue-ray version has some good extras and give some nice backstory. Nice seeing that the brought out the fire in Dejah Thoris and kept her as the<br />strong female role like Burroughs did.  The one big change from the original book was that Carter was married, but what happened<br />to his family was well portrayed in two of the most stiring scenes in the movie. It makes you want to cheer for a slaughter. I would<br />reccomnd this blue-ray to anyone whole likes a great swords and romance tale

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was a good quality show with intelligent writing and great acting. Rate it a+! Need more quality programming on television!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|As soon as someone gets first place, the game is over. They should at least let the game continue on until there's only one person left.  Regardless, this app/game is very fun. Brings me back to my childhood. Nostalgia up the ass!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|My thoughts on this movie seem to be the same as the general opinion. Like the movie but not one of the best from Pixar. But being &#34;not of their best&#34; is still better than most others.

B0068FZ0GK|5.0|This is one of favorite shows. I would also recommend &#34;Dave&#34; with Kevin Kline.  Makes you feel good about people
B0012QTT4O|5.0|Yeah, I know...you read a lot of the rave reviews, and you can't believe it's that good. Well, it is. And I'm one of most cynical, anti-p.c. programming types you'll find anywhere. You'll find none of the usual p.c. garbage in BB. But most importantly it's simply a great story. All the actors do  great jobs. I guess maybe it's the quality of the show and the scripts, but there's not one weak performance. I don't think I have to go over much of the details of the plot about a high school chemistry teacher stricken with cancer who is determined to leave his family not in a destitute situation, gets into the methamphetamine biz, and finds himself entangled in situations he finds harder and harder to divorce himself from. Another angle to the plot is the fact that he eventually seems to grow into the new and far more sinister life and character he claims he really isn't. There are some minor plot quibbles about a chemistry genius who is just a high school teacher and the fact that his medical bills would not in reality be as dire as the the show makes them out to be, but you'll forget all that minor caviling very quickly. One of the many great plot devices are the little snippets of odd-looking scenes at the beginning of many episodes that reveal themselves later on to be much more pertinent than they seem. Interesting to find out the actor who plays Walter White Jr. (Mitte) actually has c.p. The wife and I are now waiting for the 5th season dvds to arrive after starting watching season 1 what seems like just a few weeks ago. In fact, she's a little irate at me for not ordering the version that gets here quicker. Get the dvd version to get the uncensored stuff.

This book contradicts the outdated misinformation that most of the medical field advocates.  This is a must read if you have predisposition for Alzheimer's, any neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, obesity, ...or if you are an American. I followed the regimen too and accidentally lost 20lbs, got off statins, and have never felt better. Take care of your brain. EVERYTHING else will fall into place. Thank you, Dr. Perlmutter!

We have a close family member who died in London aged 31 due to drugs and alchohol abuse so James struggle against drugs was so very interesting, personal and admirable.  Well done James and your amazing cat Bob, I have just bought the next book &#34; The world according to Bob&#34; and will have to post a photo on your twitter account of Bob on our Game Farm in South Africa.<br />Wishing you an amazing future, you deserve it.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Meh!  Special effects were good, and the french character police detective is an excellent actress, even in this thin vehicle.  She stood out.  Also, the scenery was gorgeously presented. Woody Harrison's character was interesting, but they only gave a key hole into his character's background so his character development was incomplete.  You didn't really care about the other character's background so not disappointed the movie didn't even try to explain them.<br /><br />This movie collapsed into chaos towards the end, like the trick cards they kept showing throughout the movie. I kept saying \\"Wha? Wha??\\"  The guy from the Facebook movie was trying to play an arrogant bad ass, which is against type and he couldn't pull it off. Morgan Freeman looked like he was waiting for his check to arrive from this stupid film so he could build up his retirement fund. There was no light in Morgan's eyes, they were dull and he seemed bored.  The female character who played one of the 4 horsemen is so beautiful, but was unnecessarily sexualized. She was a talented magician, like the others, but for some reason she always had to wear sexy short tight outfits with stiletto high heel shoes, even when running (unlike the men who got to wear flat shoes and plain white t-shirts and loose black pants). I found that insulting and gratuitous.<br /><br />Overall the film was stupid and when it started collapsing I was a little annoyed I'd spent so much time watching.  The special effects were good...oh I think I said that.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you like the other books in this series, you're going to like this one also. You've already read thousands of pages in ASOIAF and there is absolutely zero reasons why you shouldn't continue with A Dance of Dragons. I found myself wishing for a major plot turn in every chapter but, because GRRM has set us up for that with previous books, I'm happy knowing that he's setting the stage for a wonderful conclusion to the series.

B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|I just knew this movie would be a total \\"Dud\\" ...Jason Sudeikis who usually shows no acting ability whatsoever actually did a good job. I adored Will Poulter's character!!!!! Yes, the movie had some raunchy moments, profanity etc... Literally kept me laughing the whole time, the movie is much better than I could have imagined. I was beginning to wonder if Jennifer Anniston was a Jinx to all her films, BTW she did an excellent job! I am usually a very harsh critic of films, mainly because the movie industry is churning out \\"Crap\\", but I totally enjoyed this movie :-)
B005LAII9O|5.0|Great price, fast ship and awesome movie!<br />My wife and I both enjoyed watching it.<br />It is obviously not for kids, in fact I won't let my teenager watch it, pretty rough violence.
B009NY43NY|3.0|As Charlaine Harris said, she couldn't please everyone with this final installment to the Sookie Stackhouse series. While the book was as well crafted as any of its predecessors, I would have preferred a different ending. However, it's not a total surprise to see how we leave Sookie. Just a bit too neat and somewhat predictable.<br />I AM relieved that Charliane stayed true to the world she created & didn't end it with Sookie awaking from a dream; a la Dallas in the 80s.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I enjoy d/s, bdsm erotica and I could barely finish this book.  It was boring and there's certainly nothing hardcore about it.  I don't know what people who have labeled this book as kinky have been reading but this book was slow and pretty tame for s&m.  I couldn't find any kind of connection to the characters even when I tried to see it as a romance instead.  The writing was juvenile and repetitious.  It didn't seem like the writer had much knowledge of the world she was writing about.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|What arrives is exactly what you would expect from this style and price of camera backpack. Pretty basic. 3 stars.<br />But, I think it is worth it to spend more on a name brand if the following does not bug you:<br />- The quality of materials is good but not exceptional. Again, the price matches it well just like a cheaper, smaller, cheaper car uses cheaper and poorly designed components. You could also spend more and get better parts on a different small car model and brand. Nothing wrong with less well designed and cheap. But, you get what you pay for and you do here.<br />- It is on the small side for a man. I don't mean the part that holds the gear. It's, OK. I mean fitting on a human. When I weighed 170 at 5 foot 11 and in the peak of health (but not a jock), I had broad shoulders and getting a suit to feel comfortable was always a hassle. Backpacks are a similar problem. If you have broad shoulders at any weight, most just do not fit right. This is on the small side and, well, the cross strap will choke you and the belt is above your belly button if you are a full grown man over 5'10&#34; with broad shoulders (and now, a middle age stomach). For average to small women, this is sized *perfect*.<br />I wish backpack makers (camping, camera, school, computer, et al) would make 2 sizes. Average (what they do now to fit small to medium people) and Grande to fit big shouldered men of all ages and sizes. The storage space is the same but the packs fit more people better. This would be nothing short of an incredible innovation if only one pack maker started doing this.<br />- The plastic strap parts, the buckles, does not work so well. Either that or the strap material does not work well with the buckles. Either way, this was a big enough problem for me that, I returned it. On my Lowepro backpack (small, cheap model), I never had any buckle or strap issues at all.<br />Amazon has a Basics line. But they need an “Essentials” line where they design a bit more and spend a bit more and sell it for a bit more on some things in the line. Camera bags and backpacks would be a good place to do this. Have a Basics and an Essentials version of the same style but on the Essentials, the quality is noticeably better in materials used and, maybe more industrial design innovation is also visible.spend a bit more and sell it for a bit more on some things in the line.

B00FP1NNJY|5.0|Teaming up once again for another sensational hit is the duo of Pitbull and Ke$ha. \\"Timber\\" is the first debut single from Pitbull's upcoming compilation album set to release in late 2013. It follows off the success of his Global Warming (2012) album, which sampled different styles of music to create club-thumping and dance friendly hits (my favorite!).<br /><br />\\"Timber\\" is no different, except it introduces a new element, the harmonica. It is a super catchy dance-pop song that will have you moving right from the start. I LOVE it! Even better is the wailing harmonica you'll hear throughout the whole track, which gives it an overall country feel. The combination of electronic and country/folk on this song really works as it has been shown in the success of Avicii's \\"Wake Me Up\\" (2013), one of the inspirations for the harmonica use.<br /><br />Bottom line: Yes, BUY THIS! This song has been on repeat the whole entire day in my house because I just can't get enough of it. Before the end of your first listen, it'll definitely have you singing if you haven't already been off and dancing.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Good plot. Way to many clues and  connections missed. Ego driven character ( Max). Overall very poor detective procedures. Immature main character.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I have been watching this show since the Pilot episode back in September 2009. I have to admit, nerdishly, that I have NOT missed a single episode in the last four (4), well, now beginning, five (5), years. Every summer, I wait eagerly, (and shamelessly,) for September/October to arrive, making my own imaginative scenarios for the new season... I freely admit that I am a Vampire Diaries junkie. I love &#34;True Blood&#34; and &#34;Twilight&#34; (the books MUCH MORE than the movies,) but The Vampire Diaries is not even in the same league, to me. In between seasons, I've kept myself busy reading and re-reading L.J. Smith's &#34;The Vampire Dairies&#34; books; &#34;Shadow Souls&#34; is by far my favorite, and I've lost count the number of times that I've re-read it; although I am also a fan of the TVD inspired books &#34;Stefan's Diaries&#34; series. I love how I get to indulge in reading about my favorite characters whilst I become enthralled at the completely different storyline. Of course, for those of us who HAVE read all the original four (4) books,(&#34;The Awakening&#34;, &#34;The Struggle&#34;, &#34;The Fury&#34;, and &#34;Dark Reunion&#34;), as well as the resurrected and re-vamped (pun intended) books that L.J. Smith has so graciously written for us die-hard fans: *THE RETURN* :: &#34;Nightfall&#34;, &#34;Shadow Souls&#34;, &#34;Midnight&#34;; then *THE HUNTERS* :: &#34;Phantom&#34;, &#34;Moonsong&#34;, &#34;Destiny Rising&#34;... And the &#34;novellas&#34;, of sorts, loosely based on the Vampire Diaries TV show on the CW: *Stefan's Diaries* ~ &#34;Originis&#34;, &#34;Bloodlust&#34;, &#34;The Craving&#34;, &#34;The Ripper&#34;, &#34;The Asylum&#34;, &#34;The Compelled&#34; ~ the latter books written in collaboration by L.J. Smith, Kevin Williamson, and Julie Plec....<br /><br />********SPOILER ALERT FOR SHOW AND BOOKS************<br />The books that have been written DURING the previous seasons just add to the love of TVD!!! Those of us who have read all thebooks can easily catch the subtle nuances of their influence throughout the entire series.... (HELLO!!! Klaus! Elena becoming a vampire, being sired to Damon, Alaric and Meredith... -I still don't get WHY they cut Meredith's character from the book when she was MUCH more prevalent than Caroline - even tho I love the show's Caroline!! - a brief nod to Mrs. Flowers in season 2, Damon's crow and mist in the first few episodes, &#34;Fell's Church&#34; as the church the vamps were entombed underneath, and even the appearance of the tomb under the church matches the description from &#34;The Fury&#34;... Of course, those are only a few similarities.... And there are way too many differences to even begin to get into; most importantly, Elena's not blond with blue eyes, the Salvatore brothers ARE NOT 500 years old and from Italy, the town is Mystic Falls, not Fell's Church, Klaus did NOT turn Katherine, who is from Germany in the book, however, on the show, Katerina Petrova (Katherine's TRUE name), was from Bulgaria. A vampire named Rose was tricked by Katerina into making her a vampire to save her from being sacrificed by Klaus as the doppelgänger to release a curse placed upon him to suppress Klaus's werewolf genes, and when broken, he became a true vampire-werewolf hybrid - and truly immortal; Nor is Klaus thousands of years old, psychic, and, at times, ghostly. None of the vampires can shape-shift into animals....or fly... Sage is a 900-year-old FEMALE VAMPIRE and not a huge, muscular, &#34;Frank&#34; or ancient Frenchman/Old One (Original) MALE VAMPIRE, Aunt Judith is now a 20-something Aunt Jenna. Elena's parents had JUST died less than 6 months ago in the TVD show, whereas, in the book, they had passed a few years earlier. In the books, Elena was, well... A snobby bitch. Not so on TVD. And I think one of the biggest changes: Elena's younger sibling is no longer a 5 or 6 year old, Margeret.... Now Elena has a 15 year old broth - Jeremy.  ****SPOILER ABOVE FOR BOOKS AND SHOW****

The concept of Bridget has, however, slightly now lost its lustre. I read a review for a new book for a new British author [[ASIN:B00E4VC70W Weak at the Knees]]and in it I found an all new and fabulous, loveable (and flawed) English heroine in Danni - I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down.

B00E9O6C96|5.0|I read the review in Cnet ([...] and since I live in a relatively small space, but did not want to sacrifice sound quality, I hopped on this train and I ain't ever getting off. This little unit is, from my perspective, revolutionary. It puts 192/24 music within reach of someone like me who has $20,000 taste but a $500 budget. This unit came in pristine condition - the people at FiiO even put a screen protector on the TFT and supplied two more. The unit also comes with a USB-Micro USB cable and a component out jack so you can hook this thing up to your stereo to enjoy the unbelievably balanced, rich, powerful sound that comes out of this little unit. I should point out that the unit comes preloaded with \\"Dr Chesky's Sensational, Fantastic, and Simply Amazing Binaural Sound Show!\\" album, mastered in 192/24, so you can get an idea - and a good one at that - of what the X3 can do. I nearly blew my brains out listening to the Bach Fugue for Organ - the highs were really high, and the lows were brain-rattling (at 43). I listen at 30 comfortably. The unit itself is really well made - solid metal all around. I was remarking to myself while listening to it how well it was made. For me, a city dweller, I couldn't be happier - I can crank up the sound as far as my ears (and brain) can stand it without getting the neighbors aggravated and sacrifice absolutely nothing by way of audio quality that hitherto would easily have set me back way more than the cost of the FiiO X3 and a pair of decent headphones which you can get for under $300. I was lucky enough to score a set of B&W P5s here on Amazon for under $200. I can't wait until they arrive. In the meantime, my trusty Bose In-Ear Mie2s are more than satisfactory at $150 (go ahead, unbelievers, chortle away - they sound great). The \\"cons\\" - and I am picking nits here, deal mainly with the controls, menu and the limits of a 64GB microSD card which must be formatted in FAT. I had to find a formatting program - not a problem - it took 4 seconds and popped it into the X3 and presto - I was in business. The controls are functional as is the menu. It's not as developed as an iPod, but this is the first iteration, and I expect that the X3 will go through some changes to its menu in the future. To me, none of the foregoing matters since I got this for the music, not the hype. It's music like I have never heard before at a price which is, well, more than reasonable considering the $1300 alternative. The FiiO X3 will take your breath away. No iPod could EVER do that.ook 4 seconds and popped it into the X3 and presto - I was in business. The controls are functional as is the menu.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|&#34;Zealot&#34; reads like a masters thesis, but lacks the erudition usually employed to impress the proctors, which means it's a great read.<br />Leave your preconceived notions at the front cover; Mr. Aslan has done his research on the context of Roman controlled Palestine 2000 years ago, the life of an itinerant preacher, on Jewish culture of the time, and the fallout of the crucifixion.<br />I would have been happy to continue exploring the internal conflicts of the early church toward the end of this book, but the title subject had been covered quite well by that time and I cannot criticize for what felt like a sudden end. The title character suffered the same fate, right?<br />I very much appreciated the authors preface. It is important to recognize that very little of what was canonized as the official version has any external sources available to verify, so he admits that he was forced to make assumptions based on the realities of the day.<br />My wife holds a degree in biblical studies and I can't wait to discuss this book with her.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best app I have. entertains and has treat graphics. it is a must get. I love horses and this is exactly what ive been looking for.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The story is so real, especially if you know Seattle. There is a certain Zen feel to looking at human life through the eyes of a dog and finding some truisms that apply to most of us. The book is both uplifting and a tear jerker in the end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game have no problems at all. But what is messed up is that rainbow dash is 90 diamonds but the rest is awesome! And Princess Luna I can't buy...
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was going to save some money and go with the Fx6300 but i'm happy that i changed my mind and bought this beautiful intel processor. Absolutely love it!

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|love angry birds and this game is a lot of fun.  just wish I didn't have to keep writing things to get amazon to accept a review- &#34;fun game&#34; would have said it all.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I have been a fan for years of Maroon 5 for years, and this is one of their best! Love it!!
B005XZHQKY|5.0|3d effects are good.  The video has some really beautiful shots in it.  Price is right for 160 minutes of underwater shoots.  It was delivered quickly.  It is very relaxing to watch this DVD.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|What an incredible album!!!!!!!!!! Just don't be mad when I tell you that Best Buy has it for 9.99 and it has an additional song!!!! These guys freakin rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfer because it is easy to play and easy to access when ever and where ever. It is easy to access because it dose not need an Wi-Fi.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I'm loving the game so far.  It just looks like some of the &quot;cooler&quot; weapons will take some time and money to unlock but that tends to be the trend with most games.  But I am still enjoying it.
B004XQO90O|4.0|Very Fast paced action.  Quite a bit of violence - o.k. for adult audiences.  Not recommended as a family movie.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My 3 year old loves this app!! I've had trouble finding games to keep her entertained but this one is a home run.
0399159347|3.0|I liked the ending better than the rest of the book. Its hard to say more without giving things away.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a very fun game and youth get to have a virtual minion and if you tap him (or her) in setain spot, he'll do cute little movements
039916409X|5.0|I've been following Margaret Lynch for almost a year. I must have watched every free video and teleseminar Margaret has created, and as soon as the book came out this week, I bought the Kindle version so I could have it asap. Margaret's book should come first before doing any more LOA work. Because if you don't get to those subconscious beliefs and get them up and out of your system (by tapping), you just spin your wheels trying to increase income and wealth. I can see that now after reading her extremely focused and well organized book. It all makes total sense now.<br /><br />I have already read through the book once, and am going back in and doing the tapping and watching her accompanying videos. (Margaret is very dynamic and funny--a fantastic video presence so well-worth watching her other videos on YouTube after you finish the book.) I've only scratched the surface by tapping on some issues about savings, goal trauma, and financial trauma -- I never heard of goal and financial trauma before Margaret's book!!! WOW is all I can say! I tapped, cried and cleared on a few seriously damaging beliefs already that I didn't even know I had, and I could feel sometimes subtle and sometimes pronounced relief and inner shifts.<br /><br />For anyone who thinks tapping is weird, well, you know, it can be at first, but keep going, watch videos, start doing it along with Margaret's videos, go along with the scripts in the book, and eventually you will be able to tap without any scripts. I also have seen movie, The Tapping Solution, have Nick Ortner's book, too, (and Carol Look's book) and it's all legit. (Nick Ortner helps parents of the Newtown tragedy work through grief using tapping which is amazing--go to his site, too!! It's The Tapping Solution.)I have come to rely and believe in tapping (after experiencing years of traditional therapy, etc., tapping brings immediate relief!).<br /><br />All I can say is that I hope to go to one of Margaret's live events one day to see this amazing coach in person!
B007RTAR64|5.0|This is a great gift for fans of Barbie and Hunger Games, Katniss. She has all the gadgets so will be popular
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun. Really like the different cities feature as it peeks the interest of the little ones. Cannot wait for the next update
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love game get rid of pop ups. Could use a little more sounds. Hints on moves would be interesting, game is addicting.
B0037B6QSY|3.0|I wanted to get more insight into how meditation works, and this book did not deliver that. A fine book about self reflection, but not enough about meditation.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I loved how this book made you feel her need to find something in her life to fill the emptiness after losing her mother and family unit. I felt her agony in her feet, her exhilaration of the trail, the thing she saw, and people she met. It was quite a journey. Kudos to Cheryl for completing the trail and not giving up.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I haven't had this app for very long, but it decided I definitely seems nice for the price. Attractive, easy to use and accurate, I would recommend this app to those who want a weather app that is in notifications.
B005L38QHA|5.0|I got this for Christmas last year and it's now a MUST HAVE while I'm playing WoW.  I couldn't get it to work as \\"Mouse Button 6-11\\". Nor can I get it to work macros from the program you download for it.  So I set the extra six buttons as Num 1-6 and it's amazing.<br />Since the buttons are read as Num 1-6, I've been able to use this with more than just WoW.  I've also set it to control Windows Media Player!  (two left-side buttons control the volume; the two buttons next to middle button as 'skip' and 'back'; middle button behind the scroll wheel is play/pause; and the right-side button is stop)
B005J2UM9S|3.0|I can't bring myself to give this movie four stars, but it's better than a three. It has some good paranormal themes and there's one scene that is just fabulous -- I won't spoiler it. The acting could be better. The constant green lighting gets tiresome. It's predictable but enjoyable. And if you're a paranormal film fan, you'll probably like it.
0061950726|3.0|I was truly captivated by Vivian's childhood as an Orphan Train rider. The first half of the book detailing the hardships and heartbreak little Vivian (Niamh) went through is very engrossing and I found the book hard to put down. Molly's tale is not as interesting and she felt a bit one dimensional to me. Towards the middle to the end , the novel seemed to take a nose dive, and became cliched and rushed and as another reviewer mentioned (\\"Very Hollywood\\"). I felt like the author ran out of steam or had a deadline, which was very disappointing since this started out as a great novel. Another reviewer mentioned a scene that was completely out of character for the young Vivian... I agree, I cannot imagine (after everything she endured as a child), that she would do what she did. After reading Orphan Train, I would like to learn more about the real orphans.
B0009X7664|5.0|Classic. Timeless. Watch it over and over especially when I need to declutter my mind from today's useless trivial situations.
B00005J6UP|4.0|This is a classic. See it and you'll want to be a wanderlust kid all over again! Love it so much I had to gift it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It's a wonderful thing to read and it is so deliciously good I want a second book so baldly read this book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A must read. Powerful and right on! I've nearly filled my entire journal with manifested experiments from a purple feather to lungs for a friend!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story presents a nice deviation from the romanticized vision of the antebellum South.  Though some of the events seemed to be a stretch, they are believable enough to make an engaging read.  The horror and inhumanity of slavery is underscored in this tale of a family whose disfunction is accepted because of their prominence.  The powerlessness of women at that time is a contributing factor, yet the strength of the female characters helps them survive.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|She was a fan of this group and I wanted to make her happy. The squeal on the other end of the phone line made me know I had done well on my gift purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing book. It had so many twists and turns it almost felt like you were really living it. I would recommend this book to anyone. The ending its astonishing and leaves you wanting more. This is book is an adventure and you never know what's conning next. I can't wait until the movie comes out. If you don't read this series then you will never know the imagination. I absolutely live this series to death.
B002RMVAZ8|2.0|It just seemed wrong. It was in the wrong temporal setting. JackLemon was a poor casting decision. The costumes made it difficult to watch as well.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this app. As an &quot;older adult&quot;, I appreciate how big the calculator is. I also enjoyed the little message that popped up today when I went to use the app. Very clever.
0062213423|5.0|She was a fan of this group and I wanted to make her happy. The squeal on the other end of the phone line made me know I had done well on my gift purchase. Bought the wristband too.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Installation instructions were not real clear. If you don't  have a new phone with touchscreen then you have to control the tv cast from your computer. Not very handy. I then had to uninstall it to be able to recieve netflix  thru my blueray player again.<br />At this point I do not find it very useful to me.
0061950726|5.0|I liked the historical aspect---did not know about the ;Orphan trains&#34;and my heart went out to those innocent children each one so likeable and awful conditions and the present day comparison also heart wrenching
140006922X|4.0|Aslan should light a candle to Fox News and their religion correspondent Lauren Green weekly in praise of unintended consequences.  Then again, God or man, Jesus certainly is one of the most important figures in world history.  So, who wouldn't be drawn to his life story?<br /><br />And what a story, and how different from what some of us learned in parochial school or bible study.  These are the reasons to read [[ASIN:140006922X Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]]:  to gain a greater appreciation of the times before and after Jesus and during his lifetime and ministry years; to see Jesus as a much fuller, dimensional human being; and to understand better what gave rise to and was the focus of his crusade.<br /><br />In short, the first century and the centuries immediately following were tumultuous times.  Jews under the oppressive dominance of Roman and, worse, of their own Temple leaders actively campaigned and revolted against their autocratic rulers.  Essentially, opposing them was the focus of Jesus and after him his followers led by his brother James.  It's a multifaceted tale you'll want to read.<br /><br />Jesus was more than the messiah of theological teachings that came after his execution, in which Paul played an instrumental role that Aslan does a good job of clarifying.  He existed as a man, the eldest of several brothers and sisters.  And he was a man of his times, a revolutionary against the Jewish establishment and Roman rule.<br /><br />The notion of Jesus as more than Christ didn't spring whole from Aslan's brain but resulted from years of research and thought on the part of others.  To his credit, Aslan devotes a quarter of the book to chapter notes and citations and includes an impressive bibliography.  You might dispute some of his conclusions, or choose to ignore them in favor of your personal beliefs, but you'll see that he's in a lengthening queue of scholars laboring to separate years of tradition and myth from historical reality, nearly always a treacherous undertaking.<br /><br />Historical and theological studies in the hands of historians and theologians can make for dry reading, which is why their books usually find modest audiences.  Aslan's virtue is that he writes well, moves the argument along at a lively pace, and paints vivid pictures of the times.  That, and the boost from Fox, probably accounts for its bestseller status.<br /><br />You'll find it worth your time no matter your religious beliefs or disbeliefs.ity, nearly always a treacherous undertaking.<br /><br />Historical and theological studies in the hands of historians and theologians can make for dry reading, which is why their books usually find modest audiences.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book is interesting but nothing you can't put down and go back to reading later. It's also very interesting to read about other people's ideas about what goes on during an intimate encounter, but not really mind-blowing.

B000VRRWW6|4.0|In addition to your literature (Shakespeare, Austen, Dickens, Wilde, Orwell, Waugh, Carroll, Stevenson, Christie, Huxley, Doyle, Fleming, Wodehouse, Kipling, Bronte, Rowling, Tolkien, Lewis... ), thanks England, for being by far and away the greatest exporter of fascinating history in the world. There would be a lot less worth reading without you.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I got this book because the title caught my attention-what a wonderfully entertaining mystery. I kept reading even when I should have been sleeping.
B00138J4QO|5.0|I purchased this album as a record during my college years and the vinyl became scratched and warped many years ago... I was pleased to find this same wonderful collection available for download from Amazon, and I am very happy with the sound quality and the selection of songs, including Moon River...  Andy Williams has an awesome voice and I highly recommend this collection of his songs for your listening pleasure...You might want to check out his Christmas songs as well for a holiday treat!!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every child third grade and up should hear this story. It opens many conversations about bullying and is a great book to teach characters and point of view. I'm sure you figured out I am a teacher:)
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Now don't get me wrong when I say different. I mean to say that it differs from the first three books. It is about a real world problem not theoretical court scenes. I read the whole series and I loved every book, but this one was the best because I related to it as a problem in my own daily life. Well done John Grisham! Well done!
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I fixed the issue of iMediaShare not detecting my TV my resetting all renderers and media servers and rebooting both the TV and the tablet.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Nice ending to the trilogy. Once again the book dragged for me when delving into Swedish politics but it is all part of the intrigue. WELL worth the read.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Great game!  I like the challenge of the game.  And the graphics are very good considering the game platform.  I definitely recommend this game.
B007SXB498|2.0|Hard to read. Too much discription. Interesting to read about those times in history, and how people lived. Tells how much influence a female had.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Game was fine until I spent $1.99 on tokens, and tried to use 100 of them to unlock the beach location. It took all my tokens, then froze. I cannot run on the beach. I sent in a complaint about a week ago, and got no response. I uninstalled it and moved on to spend money on better games that don't rip me off. Live and learn.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|What a thrilling ride! Great story telling. No dull spots. Can't wait to get to the next one in the series.
0345529057|4.0|I had already read the first book, but wanted to read the rest. It's a lot more compact than what I'm use to. The pages are a little thinner and the words are tiny, but overall it does its job.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A unique book with a provoking perspective. I&#34;ll look for more of his books. The best i've read in years. Thanks.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a awesome game for kids and it rock when I play it I think of people I kwon
B0086900TI|5.0|A well-told story in a powerful film! Strong performances by entire cast! Brody's character radiates the frustration and sadness indicative of a teacher caught in the vice grip of a burned-out school administration and an apathetic student body.Caan's character shows another side of the situation -- anger -- and handles it with sarcasm and disgust. Marcia Gay Hardin puts forth just the right amount of shock and hurt as she sees her career obliterated by unforgiving boosters of a cold, stiff new &#34;test culture&#34; in education. And the young prostitute befriended by Brodys character breaks his philosophy of noncommitment in a touching manner. I found &#34;Detachment&#34; a very moving vehicle and I'd certainly recommend it.<br /><br />Jim Reyburn
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Rovio continues to do a great job with refining the gameplay of their flagship game.  There are inherent limitations in the fun you can have just flingin' birds, but they push the envelope and add in other payoffs.<br /><br />It's not just mindless fun either, as you need control and planning to succeed.  Well done overall.<br /><br />Other free apps I like that are more brainy/thinking games:<br /><br />--[[ASIN:B00F5NWBJU Figure O'Speech]] (visual/word puzzles that suggest names/phrases/titles; unique and fun for lateral thinkers)<br /><br />--[[ASIN:B008JK6W5K Logo Quiz]] (kind of embarrassing how many I know)<br /><br />--[[ASIN:B00EZWPFW2 Unriddle Riddle]] (again, quick and easy to learn, and a good mix of easy and hard)<br /><br />--[[ASIN:B00EO1CN1U True or False : Fun with TrueFalse Free]] (quick test of general knowledge)

B00FPGV3RS|3.0|I really wish I would've waited to rent instead of buy. It was worth watching once but not a 2nd or 3rd time. My 8 year old will need to wait another 5 years before I'll let him watch it.<br />I didn't like jeff bridges' character at first. I thought the director was just trying too hard on him. But as the character got flushed out during the movie, he was the best part. Of the many quotables, one of my favorites was 'that scared the sh## outta me!'
B00F2362IE|1.0|Wd not down load and I have spent 3.99 for nothing . All I want is it downloaded to my kindle or my money returned. Said not enough storage so took all my books off and still won't do it . Need help

B001PU8N0I|5.0|This production illuminates a wonderful story, and is perfectly cast.  Claire Foy is a lovely Dorrit, and Tom Courtenay appears in one of his very best roles as her father.  It's one of my favorite movies.  This one is worth owning.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Good Hypothesis  , thought Provoking , I would not say this book gives a conclusive evidence on a winning formula , but this does make one force to look at things from various vantage points. That it self is  a good start.<br /><br />One chapter made me think a lot about students going to Competitive schools ; how they are measured on a relative  scale etc., I am not sure Mr. Gladwell directed readers well. He purely looked from competitive ( focused on failure ) standpoint , but in reality it is working to their benefits many ways  . Ex : Networking benefits to start with , IVY guys made tons of money ( well moral , immoral or they happy not it's a different argument altogether for that we can read Liar's Poker etc  ) and control so called power structure in US. It does helps to leverage in anyways whole life .<br /><br />A great read !! Excellent story teller. I hope he will do a book on failures by Smart and Energetic Political or Business  leaders and what has gone wrong with them and what we can learn.

0307271080|4.0|Americanah, is THE book of non American Blacks in America. The portrayal of race relations in America is spot on. I can definitely understand why it resonated with immigrants while making American readers uncomfortable due to such a focus on America's taboo topic.<br />The realistic insight into the life of immigrants, legal or illegal gets 5 stars. However, the underdevelopment of other principal characters Obinze and auntie Uju, the abruptness of the end of the story, as well as the fairy tale sections about Ifemelu's entry into life in upper class America take some of the edge off.<br />I'd recommend this book to immigrants who long to hear their story told, but also to everyone to find a down to earth, entertaining novel.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I've read a lot of bad reviews on this book that prevented me from reading it for a while.  Taking all the bad reviews into consideration, I finally caved and read it for myself.  I must admit that I'm actually not surprised to find that I really liked it.  And I see where all the negative reviews are coming from.  Sure, there are a lot of disturbing behavior displayed in the book that I wouldn't condone, but this is a story after all and people in their right mind should know the difference between right and wrong.  I think the point is that no one is perfect and there are quite a few people who are dysfunctional.  But that doesn't necessarily make them evil and I firmly believe that people can change for the better, and sometimes that change is due to another person's good influence.  Not everyone is blessed with an extreme amount of self-confidence and/or self-respect.  There are people who've had things happen to them in their past that have broken them, and sometimes all these people need is a savior.  I'm rambling and all I'm trying to say is that I can't agree with the negative reviews after having read the book myself.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an awesome series to read, I loved every single book! It was both interesting, funny, the characters were well developed and you love them. The storyline was spellbinding.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Bones just keeps getting better and better each year!  So glad to have all of Season 8 episodes to watch with no commercials!
B007ZMD14I|5.0|THE MESHING OF MYLES KENNEDY AND SLASH WORKS! GREAT ALBUM IN EVERY WAY! 5-STAR RECOMMENDATION! MYLES AND SLASH COULDN'T SOUND ANY BETTER!.............. ALBUM ROCKS!
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|was a good ending to the hangover movies... was a more serious one compared to the other 2 hangover movies but the ending was very good and the extra scene in the credits was just awesome
0316236446|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter and it arrived as described and she loves it and uses it all the time
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughters love this game.  It is also good for introducing children to pet care.<br /><br />All in all is a fun and entertaining game.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game helps pass the time where ever you are!  The girls are fun to make up and they look beautiful when you are done.  This is fun for girls of any age!
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Robert Downey Jr is great in this movie. It's a little bit of a different movie--kind of quirky.  Funny and more.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Sound is fantastic, the padding is comfortable and the range is just what i was looking for. Setting up the software was a bit of a pain on windows 8 and it can be fickle about crashes, but I only had to get it to work long enough to set up the buttons and the equalizer. It can also get a little warm around your ears but its acceptable. Overall a good buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a must play game... there is never a dull moment... be warned it is extremely addictive, however all ob the name of clean fun...
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Very fun game, but had freezing of game and when it had as a accomplishment to earn points downloading Ice Age never went through when  I downloaded game.
B00E95ED32|5.0|Avicii is a genius.  Faves are Wake Me Up and Lay Me Down! Love it! I play it every day.
1449314287|5.0|i wound up in a spot where google wasn't helping and stackoverflow turned up blank. thankfully i had this laying around from school, and it helped me narrow my thoughts and come up with the right questions.<br /><br />chapters (don't mind my spelling): mysql architecture and history; benchmarking mysql; profiling server performance; optimizing schema and data types; indexing for high performance; query performance optimization; advanced mysql features; optimizing server settings; operating system and hardware optimization; replication; scaling mysql; high availability; mysql in the cloud; application level optimization; backup and recovery; tools for mysql users.<br />appendixes: forks and variants of mysql; mysql server status; transferring large files; using explain; debugging locks; using sphinx with mysql.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|This book is awesome!!!!!I love these books! :) :D I give this book 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Rick Riordan for writing this book! I never want this series to end! Long live percabeth!!!!!!!!!! I will never grow out of Rick Riordan books! ;)
B004HYDL1K|5.0|IF YOU ENJOY THIS MOVIE, THEN SEE THE SEQUEAL.ITS HAS DRY HUMOR AND GUILTY PLEASURE THAT ANY GRINDHOUSE MOVIE  LOVER WOULD ENJOY.IT'S SCIENCE FICTION BECAUSE CHARIE SHEEN IS THE PRESINDENT  and MEL GIPSON IS AN ACTOR!!!!JK
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was truly a wonderful book full of insights into the lives of husbands and wives,marriage and relationships. The role that coincidence plays in our lives and seemingly meaningless choices greatly effect our futures. This is a book to enjoy.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The DVD was in perfect condition and plays great. The shipping was more than I like to pay but hey, isn't it always?
B000127LW2|5.0|I'm a die-hard Star Trek fan, and Voyager never disappointed.  True to the Roddenberry philosophy, continued to explore ethics and the human condition, interesting stories and characters.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|&#34;your Cheatin Heart&#34; and &#34;You Are My Sunshine&#34; are real standouts here!  This is a seamless blending of country's raw pain and blues' raw emotion.
B00004SZWD|5.0|A classic piece of popular art that puts the work of most other pop &#34;artists&#34; to shame.  Talent, genius, and skill combined.  Okay, &#34;Isn't She Lovely&#34; might be sappy, but it works.  Other songs cover &#34;deeper&#34; and &#34;serious&#34; issues and not in a knee-jerk or superficial way.  SW has something to say and says it with grace.
B00000331V|5.0|This is a &#34;must have&#34; for anyone who loves rogk and roll. Fantastic live CD. A classic that endures the test of time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a useful and versatile app. Does what it says without a lot of fluff. I would recommend this app.
0060775858|5.0|I first bought this book for my grand-daughter and she absolutely loves it.  I am not sure why, but she does and that makes me happy. I bought another copy for my grand-nephew and he loves it.  Simple book but the kids get it and love it.
B0000047CX|5.0|This was purchased as a gift - I've had it myself on LP and CD for 30 years or so and before that listened to my brother's copy.  Never, ever have I tired of it. One of the most enduring and wonderful recordings ever by a group of gifted artists.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|You SHOULD get the app man you  can make videos<br />Get it now you will miss the fun DOWNLOAD NOW I am not going to wait for you
B00908DDZM|5.0|Heard it one MTVs MVA show and knew I wanted to add it tyo my music collection. Highly recommend it
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great brain/concentration exercise and fun game, but I must warn you, it can become addictive, especially, to this senior citizen.  I discovered this fun game when I visited with a dear friend recently who told me how must she enjoys playing this fun game in her spare time.  After playing a few games, I understand why she likes this game so much.  I would highly recommend this game to any one who enjoys a challenge or needs something to occupy their time, while doing brain exercise.  Love this game and the price is great to.
B00640UICA|5.0|both the daughter and I (she is 6) enjoy trying to outdo each other in this game. I like that the objective is to make the characters happy. that's a good thing nowadays.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got this cheap, it was shipped early and, duh, the movies freaking rocks. Buy it is you can find it on daily deals.
014241493X|5.0|I really enjoyed this one the most and it was great to be able to discuss it with teenagers, especially my oldest granddaughter.
B003CHGVH4|5.0|I'm coming to this whole party a little bit late.  I have a somewhat unusual situation to report:  I was primary caregiver for a dad who passed from cancer.<br /><br />Right around the time this show started back in '08 or so, was when it was all starting to come down for us.  I think I watched a few of the first episodes actually together *with* my dad, and he felt it was hitting too close to home, too painful to watch.  I had a lot of work to do taking care of him, so I basically didn't have much time for appointment television back then, and I eventually forgot about the show.<br /><br />Well, here it is, the ending season of the show, and I've watched almost none of it.  I really felt left out, hearing people talk about this on Twitter and FB, so I felt like now that I have the time, I'll go back and catch up.<br /><br />Well, I'm really glad I did, and I think I'm in for the duration.  This show deserves a place amongst the greatest shows in modern tv history, it's so well done.
1476727651|4.0|Stephen King has always been a favorite author for me.  His Dark Tower series are my favorite of all his books, and I have read the majority of his work. Since the end of the Dark tower series, I have enjoyed Under the Dome, 11-22-63, and his short story collections. I was not a fan of Lisey's Story or Duma Key. I prefer his earlier works for horror such as It, The Shining, Pet Sematary, The Regulators, and Needful Things. Doctor Sleep is not blood and gore horror, but it is psychologically unnerving.  As a parent, the thought of someone after your child is always terrifying whether it be a bully at school, a coach, a teacher or a former boy or girlfriend can be troubling.  But when the person wanting to do your child harm in a psychological or physical way or both, and you can't grasp why, that is a framework for a disturbing tale.<br /><br />Unlike some, I enjoyed the background of the AA, Dan's journey into sobriety, and his redemption finding a special niche in the retirement home along with a cat.  Even if Mr. King may not be as scary as some would say, I think a lot of what scared us 20 years ago would no longer scare us as we get older. But again, anyone with small children will find this tale disturbing, as well as entertaining.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game it is really fun and I never get bored of it and I hope you like it to
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It is an eye opener.  A majority of the people are ruled by terror and  violence, while a few elitists benefit off the back of the common people.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is very addictive. I am not a big fan of hidden object games and yet I play this game daily.
0425166805|4.0|I have heard about this book for many years and finally decided to get it. As I knew about most of the items discussed, the book wasn't a revolutionary as when it was first published
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|No spoilers just know that all the ends are tied up. So get to reading. Sanderson did well in adapting Jordan's writing style and not forcing his own on the books.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What an incredible follow up to the Shining!<br /><br />Enraptured from the beginning to the end...<br /><br />King thoughtfully brought all the original characters in and exploded the new ones to new heights in horror fiction .<br />What an awesome ending to the Shining  Stephen King...<br />You Rock!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game masters the elements of Magic the Gathering. For those of you who are Standard players, you might not enjoy it as much. But any magic player will love it. The game itself has great A.I. and the difficulty level changes with the level you play at. It poses a challenge to any player, and you just can't wait until you unlock better cards. It never gets bored or tiring. Granted, it might frustrate you from time to time, but the game in itself has to be perfect, or the closest it could come to it. And for new players, it educates you on how to play.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie is a knockout in 3D.  The storyline and action keep your eyes glued to all dimensions.  The only slight downside was a main characters accent not being correct, and another main character dying instead of living.  Watch it to find out who.
B008MM9630|5.0|Love the game and Fun to play and Easy to play and It is a free game. Buy it. You will love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best apps ever on a kindle. This game is addictive,fun, and well colorful this game should be played by everyone. Its amazing.
B0091QS88K|2.0|Well on first it was pretty fun but the second time boring because well you don't get to pick what to make or pick what to add to your food<br />Not the best
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I was so excited when this came. The insert that holds the blue ray's is a little bit sketchy but nothing to fret over. I was very impressed with all of the features that came on most of the discs. The Deathly Hallows did not have these additional features and it seemed like the menus on these discs didn't 'mesh' with the way the others were set up but overall I am very happy! It arrived in about a week with the free shipping and was packaged nicely.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game was really cool I love this app it is amazing  . The ponies look supper cute and adorable . Love
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|The game is good but the sky diving needs to be Improved but it is a great game overall, Jason rocks
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that it doesn't tell you how to play the game and you figure them out as you go. they're entertaining and makes you want to continue unlocking more of the games in a sequence.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|if you love kerk and the boys you cant go wrong<br />all space senes have ben redun<br />its  all ben cleaned up and very good job to
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Can't get enough of dysfunction. If you've never seen the show, it's worth watching an episode or two before you buy a season.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this is awesome but I don't understand why I can't get rid of facebook off of Amazon app store because I've already got Facebook on my phone through the Play Store, and it tells me I can't even update it on the Amazon app on my phone because my storage is low.. please fix ur I'm going to have to delete Amazon app store off of my phone altogether, but it will stay right on my Kindle Fire HD, where is perfect..
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app provides more info than I expected. I enjoy having the weather so easy and always with me. I will recommend<br /> it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is the same as all the others. After awhile it gets old and I don't want to play it anymore. I just started the game. I can tell you this though the clues are very well hidden for myself.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Had a great time seeing this movie. It was after a long day at work and a particularly nasty street fighting with some visiting Nuns from Texas. Big hair. Such big hair.<br /><br />Anywhere, after getting paroled I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered in my trauma recovery sessions.<br />It was. It gave me a new appreciation of lens flares in movies. I think Avatar would've benefited with 75% more lens flares. That was probably Avatar's biggest non full frontal related flaw.
B000002B5L|5.0|Good throwback, this cd brought back some great memories from back then. still is a good cd to listen to start to finish.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a blast! loaded easily and works great on my fire. Very much like Mario bros but with an Irish twist. Easy to play even if you are not a &quot;gamer&quot;.
B00594XOZU|1.0|THIS STUPID THING IS TAKING ALL DAY I HAVE PPL TO TEXT AND STUFF I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO BE WAITING FOR Y'ALL
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I usually base how much I like a movie on the theatre popcorn and whether or not I'm stabbed in the restroom. This movie was so good, not only for my lack of blood loss, but for the actual content and images that flashed before my sensory stump.<br /><br />Forget the naysayers, some people just weren't loved by their parents and spend their lives lashing out at the world and drinking too many sugary drinks. I say nay to the naysayers. Nay, you guys!<br /><br />Anyhoo, just buy this.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Loved it. Great movie. Loaned to a friend of mine who also likes history. You never fail to amaze me for your quick response with deliveries.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Saves me a lot of time while searching for music that is not terribly contemporary.  I use it a lot.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Quickly delivered, in excellent condition.Sent this to a friend of mine, thought it would be delivered AFTER his birthday but he got it BEFORE. Lol.
0316228583|1.0|...................stated in the previous 923 one star reviews, I hated this book. Do not waste your time or money. This book would never have been published if the author's name was anything other than J. K. Rowling.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Very good. Had to watch before the 3rd season came on Showtime, which I am watching now. Love the show. Love your fast response after ordering.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Addons Detector, Appbrain Ad Detector and TrustGo Ad Detector, all free and very good had not found any ads in this excellent application. I recommend to the everybody to visit xnview.com and to try excellent and free applications for the Windows OS and some of the Linux OS too. I am using them a long years ago, every time I scan them on vvirustotal.com and jotti.com. All of the applications are always clean. Avira and Avast antiviruses (paid) are with same results too.<br />Try this application and enjoy in it, it is really excellent and I recommend it. There are and always will be a  people on this world who do not like themselves and hate everybody else.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is fun to play and I like the graphics. It gradually gets harder with more and more tiles to match.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|I've been a fan of Korn since back in '98, back in the 'Follow the Leader' days. I've dug what they were trying to do with the `Headless' years, but it seems like they were struggling with production problems with the 'Untitled/Korn II' album (even if it was a solid album) and the heavily flawed 'Korn III: Remember Who You Are'. I can only attest the attempt to recreate their raw mid 90's work to studio pressure and/or temporary insanity. I loved the spine it took for the band to put out The Path to Totality, even if it was clear that it was a one-time experiment.<br /><br />Then of course the big event occurred, Brian `Head' Welch came back to the band. I saw the reunited Korn play back in Silver Spring in May, and the set was mostly from the self-titled debut album. It put a mild sense of unease in me that they would try to revive the 90's with The Paradigm Shift. I was worried we would end up with Korn IV: Now We Totally Remember Who We Are. Seriously This Time.<br /><br />The release of `Never Never' as the first single may have confused people, considering it is the oddball of the album. I think it was a declaration that 'The Paradigm Shift' was going to be different, and not what you expect.<br /><br />Which is true, I didn't expect the best, most confident Korn album in years. 'The Paradigm Shift' is an apt title as it sees Korn taking their signature metal/rock sound from the hip-hop sound of old to infusing it with new electronic/synth/stadium rock sound. Songs such as `Never Never,'  `Lullaby for a Sadist,' `Victimized,' and many of the choruses see them just nailing an epic stadium rock sound that is completely new and oh so amazing! It never over powers the guitar work. It's impossible, Head and Munky's guitars sound so heavy it feels like getting curb-stomped by Godzilla. This is the perfect blend of old elements and new elements to create pure eargasmic pleasure.<br /><br />Funky 'Follow the Leader' riffs? It's in there.<br /><br />Haunting 'Issues' elements? Check.<br /><br />Melodic 'Untouchables' choruses? Yup.<br /><br />Crushing 'Take a Look in the Mirror' heaviness? Oh gawd yes.<br /><br />Electronic/synth elements from 'See You on the Other Side' and 'Untitled/Korn II'? Better than it's ever been.<br /><br />Fan of 'The Path to Totality'?  Looking for some `wub wub?' There is some `wub wub!'<br /><br />The only Korn `fans' that won't like this album are those who will whine that this isn't as raw as 'Korn' or 'Life is Peachy'. But I've learned to tune them out since '98.<br /><br />There isn't a single song on this album I don't like. Even the whipping boy `Never Never' becomes great in context with the other songs. I guess if I had to pick favorites it would be `What We Do,' `Paranoid and Aroused,' and everything from `Punishment Time' through `It's All Wrong.'<br /><br />'The Paradigm Shift' should be put up with Rob Zombie's 'Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor' and Stone Sour's 'House of Gold and Bones' as the best rock albums of the year. If you're a Korn fan, buy this album now, if you're a casual Korn fan, buy this album.  Join the Korn of the future!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Loved the show but did not expect what happened at the end. I will order more DVD seasons as I need them.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Really good application, great game. Very nice sound effects, excellent graphic. I enjoy in this game very much and I never ever could not understand a people who do not like themselves and who hate all world. I recommend this little game, try it and enjoy in it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is normally NOT my choice for reading.  I had gotten interested in the series.  I found them so interesting I started from the beginning and read the first four books.  Waiting for the latest to download.  The story line, plot development, character development are wonderful.  Wonderful storyteller!  If you want to get lost in a story....start reading.  Gotta go....Dance with D Ramon's is waiting!!!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was a complete page turner and had me fully engaged.  The characters were well defined and realistic, and likeable.  The setting was different and intriguing.  Looking forward to reading the next installment!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is 1 of the best games I have ever played thank you for making this game I love you
B00992CF6W|5.0|pllllsssss add villagers and more updates its so fun. just like the pc version but with a little less stuff
B00DNDR29I|4.0|This album is good for me to ride in my car.  It has a very eccentric, pop style to it that's different from what I hear.  It has a very good ole school, modern twist with it.  My favorite songs are Q.U.E.E.N., electric lady and ghetto woman.  I would recommend for anybody who wants something fresh, new and unique.
B005BCE7FQ|3.0|I was expecting more fun music<br />I liked it ok not great<br />Not sure if I want the sequel<br />Would have gone with Epic instead
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really creative, genius plotting! Knocked off a star because the ending was anti-climatic and uninspired. Otherwise a really wild ride!
B000IK8JTG|5.0|Many ppl have reviewed this very well already so I'll just say I've also read the book and have seen many versions and this IS the best one. For this story it's all about the character's feelings and that requires great acting and that is what this movie has that the others fell short of. I always get this version when I'm in the mood for Wuthering Heights. I really should just buy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince has done it again. I read every thing he writes. I then pass them on to my son-in law because he is also a fan
B00D41AJ7G|2.0|I really wanted to like this game and the first few levels are OK. Overall it was a half hour of play and done.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Once again kept me guessing into the final pages. Once again finely drawn characters and a superbly crafted heart-pounding story.
0375413405|5.0|I had a copy and gave it away.  Why?  I don't know.  This is a classic.  OK Honestly, the recipes are a bit involved, but It's great to have a reference point. And for the complex, recipes recruit friends.  Julia said it herself, &#34;Cooking with friends is so much fun&#34;.  Enjoy.
B008N1V11U|5.0|My daughter loved this game. I would recommend this game to all. It was super cool. Check it out you will love it to.
B0074JODEY|3.0|Having never seen the other four Shogun Assassin films, I still bought the box set of the entire series. What I wish would've been included is the option of watching the first film in it's entirety, the original cut of the three films that made up the first when it became &#34;Shogun Assassin.&#34; That being off my chest, I still love SA in blu-ray HD. It does looks better than off of DVD, obviously. The other films progressively get less and less interesting, but if you only buy it for the first one with the intention of someday watching other, you'll have your money's worth right there.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|John Gresham not at his best. It is extremely rare that I don't want to finish a book. Made it through this by glancing at irrelevant words and moved on. Football analogy: I've got one of the best coaches in the league, Gresham, he didn't get me to the playoffs. Racketeer sucks.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My daughter play this game every day. I would recommend this game to everyone. It was fun to play. Try it out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great product for people who don't have/ don't want to pay $100 for apple tv or roku or you don't have a gaming system. Not only does Netflix and Youtube play effortlessly, any other video in a tab can play full screen. Fantastic invention from a fantastic innovative company.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great great game I love best game in the world you don't have to tailor your device very helpful recommend ed five stars thumbs up with the wait
B000I9YX06|5.0|A thrilling movie one my favorite movies with Will Smith. If you're looking for an action sci fi movie then watch this. This movie has a good balance for just a movie to watch and a sci fi goodie bag. But I will say if you don't like sci if then don't watch it Will Smith and Alan Tudyk do a great job in making the movie awesome however at the end of the day it's a sci fi film.<br />Hope this helps<br />Enjoy!
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|I enjoyed to watch this movie. It is very interesting and provided with good entertainment.<br /><br />five more words required? next time Amazon can fill in the blank space for me.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I would highly recommend this book, it has been written beautifully and it felt like the characters were actually talking to me telling me about their own lifetime journeys and the triumphs and tragedies they experienced. It makes me feel guilty for ever complaining about the silly stuff. A very emotive, personal and enjoyable read.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great cover for the Kindle Fire HD.  No problems if the cats step on it. Well worth the investment to protect the Kindle.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Loved this book as much as the first! Patrick rothfuss is a master storey teller.I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|More darker than the original version but much better. Maybe Sandra Bullock killed it for me in the first one with Stallone, but I was pleasantly suprised by this one. Guns blazing!
B00AMS38YU|5.0|it an awesome action movie with a great end. i would totally give it 2 thumbs up.. BUT be prepared to want to give it a try
B009UNGYHG|4.0|The carrying case is perfect and charges the headset when not in use.  No more messing with charging wires or having the headset run out of power.  The only thing I don't like is the USB cable does not fit in the case too, but the battery life means I don't need to charge it every day so it's not a show stopper.  The case does not latch, but is sleek enough to fit securely in handbag or flat pocket.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Very colorful film with some smart suspense by the director. If your kids like the Wizard of Oz, they'll enjoy this one as well. Some people didn't care for the main actor who plays oz in the film. I thought he did a decent job but nothing that knocked my socks off.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I've had issues with it locking up during a game or losing connection. I have been reimbursed. For lost connection but not locking up. I buy additional bingo coins so is is somewhat upsetting. I wish there was more ways to earn powerups and bingo chips. Overall I like this game a lot and recommend it to friends and family.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|You will enjoy this! It wasn't as great as the first, but delved into the plight of these charactors growing up........ It was fun and exciting to watch! I wish I could watch it with my wife, but it would be too gory for her. It's a grown up film. You must watch the first to gain the feel of this movie. They can easily make a third!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I'll rent about anything with Morgan Freeman, and while I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, this movie is very good. The scenery where the film<br />was shot was just extraordinary. Neat storyline. I highly recommend it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love reading from my kindle (prices for books are so cheap!). I'm excited to be able to read on my phone now, as well. The layout is great (the text is a good size) and makes it easy to read. Great app overall!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my niece, she enjoyed it, and it was an addition to her collection.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Just remember to keep your eyes out for the \\"DUKE\\", you know him A Number 1! They did make a sequel \\"Escape from L.A., but this here movie is one you'll enjoy. Plenty of action and I just love the background music when the DUKE drives by in his pimped out ride! This is one of those cool older films that even modern day young adults can enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My favorite infinite-runner app (I've been playing since it came out. Still not bored!). Great game + Minions = Completely amazing and satisfying game overall!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Works perfectly on my iPod or cell phone but won't let me login on my kindle fire is pain in the butt fix this please.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This film is the real \\"eye of the tiger\\". Very heartwarming story about determination, love, resilience. Actors in this film do a great job as well. Film has some similarities to \\"Cast Away\\" with Tom Hanks, although I thought this one much more capturing. Really enjoyed it!
0345472322|5.0|The insights presented in this book are so fundamentally important that this book is easily worthy of a five-star rating!  Dweck makes a very clear case; in order to raise happy, self-motivated, and self-fulfilled adults, teachers and parents must understand the difference between \\"fixed\\" and \\"growth\\" mindsets.  Then, they must know how to cultivate a mindset of \\"growth.\\" And, more critically, *avoid* accidentally cultivating \\"fixed\\" mindsets.<br /><br />As Dweck explains how \\"fixed\\" mindsets develop, it becomes obvious that the United States' school system is designed to raise, educate, and graduate \\"fixed\\" mindsets. Dweck shares empirical evidence that illustrates how damaging the \\"fixed\\" mindset is. She clearly addresses actions/behaviors we, as parents and teachers, should avoid.  She also describes specific ways in which we can foster mindsets of \\"growth.\\"<br /><br />The most essential chapters of this book are Chapters 1,2,3, & 8.  If you only read these, you'll be golden!  Chapters 4-7 elaborate on very specific examples of the fixed vs growth mindset in sports, business, relationships, and parenting/teaching/coaching. These examples clearly drive home her point, as they relate to each specific area.  But, these chapters are not essential to understanding the core point of this book.<br /><br />As an educator and parent coach, I put this book on the top of my list as a recommendation for all teachers and parents, simply because the information is so fundamental to the care, nurturing, and growth of happy, self-confident children, teens, and young adults.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I almost just sent this straight back to netflix due to the negative reviews this movie is getting. But I'm so glad that I didnt. This is one of the better movies I've seen this year. Will Smiths acting is still great, and his son, people, lay the heck off, he did a very good job in this movie, especially considering what the role would require. It has comedy, action, horror, drama, and dont even get me started on some of the beautiful shots of &#34;Earth&#34; in this movie. Consider it bought on my end and added to my blu ray collection. Hope others give it a chance like a I did.
1476727651|5.0|I got this book the day it was available and I waited a few days to start reading it because I thought that I might want to re-read the shining first.  However, patience is a virtue that I lack and so it was less than a week later when I started to read it.  For those of you who have not read The Shining or like me, have not read it in a long time, do not worry about missing anything in this book because all of the relevant information from The Shining is given to you the Doctor Sleep.  You can still very much enjoy this book without re-reading The Shining.  I was over the moon happy to see the story of Danny Torrance all grown up.  This is classic Stephen King, menacing characters, a dash of the supernatural and people banding together to fight.  The writing moves along quickly and you won't want to put this book down. I am a huge Stephen King fan and this reads like some of his earliest, and best works.  Highly recommended to fans both new and old.
0321344758|4.0|I read this book a few years ago and it was even a bit outdated then. BUT, principles never change and it covered basic principles well. What I like about it, more than anything, is that it stuck to the point of the title relentlessly.  In other words, the greatest value it provides is to drive home the ever-essential point that web design should not make potential customers waste a moment's energy on deciphering where to go or what to do next.  Kudos to the author for this relentless focus!<br /><br />As I type this review, I notice that a 3rd edition is available for pre-order.  I will be checking that out, for sure.

It is hilarious, romantic, and incredibly well read.  If you don't want to pay attention to Shakespearean dialogue, then this movie is not for you.  But I recommend it highly.

B0066O0NP6|3.0|I really wanted to like this series; plus, I enjoy binge-viewing from time to time and need something fairly captivating to accomplish this....  I'm almost all the way through Season 1, and I'm still waiting for the pace to pick up or the stories to gain momentum! And what is with Alicia (the Good Wife) arriving LATE to every courtroom, every board meeting, every meeting with a client---everything in her life? Is that one of the &#34;themes&#34; this uneventful series is banking on? It's as if the directors are saying, &#34;Well, how shall we start this scene? Oh, yeah, we'll have Alicia enter the courtroom late again.&#34; Once you notice this pattern, you will be supremely annoyed episode after episode. Negative diatribe aside, I still continue to watch one episode every other night or so. But my viewing of The Good Wife is more like looking under a bandaid to see if my cut is still healing.

You gain this energy back even if you are not on the app. I recommend this on the tablet instead of cell phone because the screen and the photos are larger.

B00D6QUMWG|4.0|A very joyful interpretation of lyrical drama by Verdi. Her voice is strong, dark and with the power of a soprano. Most of the operas are drowning by the well known arias of the standard repertoire. Here are some not so well known arias. A discovery with a beautiful voice lightens the arias and it is a short intermezzo in the opera world.

B00FSBW2L6|5.0|This is a story of a Bavarian family that, for the most part of their lives, lived in or around \\"a huge farm with an equally impressive and renowned restaurant and inn, called The Black Eagle Inn, just outside the city limits of Heimkirchen, a sleepy Bavarian town.\\"<br /><br />The back story starts at the beginning of the century, even before the Great War. Anna Stockmann, nee Hinterberger, one of the central figures in this novel, grows up to be a very unusual girl--she has a firm grasp of business and a Machiavellian mind, that allows her to outmaneuver her siblings, even her older brother, when the time came to inherit. To my mind, her story is one of the most interest in seeing how people change through their lives. I would even go so far as to say that her life is an allegory of the old Germany, it mirrors it so closely.<br /><br />While Anna has ho children of her own, some of her siblings procreate prodigiously, and from those offspring, a new generation of the family, who will play an important role in bringing this story to a conclusion, appears.<br /><br />Just naming all of the characters would take much of the place for which this review allows. Suffice it to say, this book is a family epic. And when I say \\"epic,\\" I really mean it. We tend to think of kings and queens, noblemen and their flock, as required to create that \\"epic\\" feel to the story. What Christoph Fischer has done is truly remarkable: he took a regular German family and gave us a book with enough plotting, machinations, politics, and intrigue to rival any of the books that concern royalty and then some. Betrayals and ambitions, loyalties and self interests are all mixed together in a constantly changing scene of the narrative without letting go.<br /><br />However, and as \\"Howevers\\" go, this is a big one: This is a book about Germany and her people. While I see Anna as an allegory for the country, her family is the representation of the German people: they can be industrious, which goes without saying; selfish and selfless, self absorbed and carrying, pious and liberal, absorbed in politics and neutral, scheming and naïve. As generations change in the family, we can also trace the changes in the German people. The later parts that of the book that describe Maria's (Anna's niece) marriage and its consequences and Marcus's (Anna's nephew) finally starting to accept himself as a homosexual really underline the changes that the after-war Germany went through and the struggles the country had to face before becoming the modern Germany we know today.<br /><br />What makes this book unique, is the time period in which the book is set. Most historical novels deal with the \\"juicier\\" timelines that involve wars and upheavals, unrest and suffering. While this novel has that as well, of main interest are the other parts that concern the pre- and post-war Germany, and its gradual, grudging transformation through the generations of people who lived through it and built that country.<br /><br />\\"The Black Eagle Inn (The Three Nations Trilogy)\\" by Christoph Fischer is a really great historical novel in best traditions of James A. Michener and Errol Lincoln Uys, that delivers a historical narrative through character exploration; a fascinating journey into a less-explored territory. Highly recommended.hout saying; selfish and selfless, self absorbed and carrying, pious and liberal, absorbed in politics and neutral, scheming and naïve.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is definitely worth your time.  I hate it when I spend any time at all reading a book only to find out it is irritatingly not well written and I have wasted my time.  Not the case with this book.  It is sweet with well thought out characters and plot with an interesting twist at the end.
B002RSQGQK|3.0|this movie officially creeped me out because you never know who is watching you from the outside!! good movie but definitely made me think twice about shutting my blinds at night!

B002OMZTSU|5.0|I didn't do this book justice by putting it aside every time another book distracted me. It took me too long to finish it but tonight I finally decided to get it done. I loved it so much I read the last 100+ pages in 2 hours. I love Craig, I think he's witty, charming and hilarious. I've been fortunate to see his standup act live and I highly recommend you do as well. He's freaking fantastic, as is this book. And hey, the sexy Scottish accent doesn't hurt either. Hope you get a chance to read and enjoy!!

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Thought provoking and grounded as much as possible in available history. Read it with The Stillborn God (Lilla) and you begin to get a narrative that sheds light on the conflict between faith and reason
6305212112|5.0|The story line is very reflective of life down south during times that were not so easy economically or racially.  Aside from a weak economy and a weak leader, today is a piece of cake.<br /><br />This movie shows a town that stood together for what is right and and helped each other when it was most needed. No protests for more government handouts from other peoples hard work.<br /><br />Be prepared for shedding some tears

B00000634J|4.0|This best of has 20 songs compared to 19 in the JOHN LENNON COLLECTION but I like the other set because it has two more songs that come from the DOUBLE FASTASY album. The two that are from that album are &quot;I'm losing you&quot; and &quot;Dear Yoko&quot;. That album is real special to me because when I started hearing all those songs in 1980, that was pretty much my first exposure to John Lennon's solo career. I hadn't even heard &quot;Imagine&quot; yet if I remember correctly. I've never heard any solo albums of John and Paul that I've enjoyed entirely (usually I only like, maybe 3 songs on any particular studio album with the exception of Double Fantasy which has at least 7 good tunes on it) but am pretty satisfied with their greatest hits compilations. I am getting rid of this best of and am going to purchase the earlier issue of The JOHN LENNON COLLECTION which has the two extra songs from DOUBLE FANTASY. With that one gripe LENNON LEGEND:The Very best of John Lennon is a fine best of that I'm sure that most people will be satisfied with.

B00DZAWPNM|5.0|I always favored \\"Panic! at the Disco\\" over \\"Fall Out Boy\\".  I just found their music more mature and appealing to both sexes and Fall Out Boy was mostly for the girls.  There was even a year when Panic was much bigger than Fall Out Boy with their debut album, but then they started to fall off the radar and become forgotten.  This was honestly a huge impulse buy for me.  I loved the debut album \\"Fever\\", when I was a angsty teenaged dude in Middle/High School.  The album had mature lyrics, but the sound of teenage angst at the time.  The second album, \\"Pretty. Odd\\" caught everyone by surprise with its Beatles-esque feel.  I loved most of it.  After that I expected more of that.  Then they released \\"Vices\\" after most of the members left the band.  It sort of mixed the sound of the first album with the second.  It was a nice catchy album, but it seemed like Panic was about to be forgotten by the masses after that.  Years later, I'm more of an adult now and I listen to more mature music of all genres.  So I hear Panics new single \\"Miss Jackson\\" and I like it, but I didn't feel stoked for the new album.  The vibe of the song sounded too similar to Fall Out Boys comeback single.  By the way I passed on FOBs comeback album, though I did listen to it online.  Then the second single came out \\"This is Gospel\\" and it was just as catchy.  Still, I felt I was too \\"manly\\" now for this album so I didn't put it on my \\"to buy\\" list.  Well the week the album came out I was at Best Buy in the new releases section.  I just needed something new at the moment and this album was there among the Miley Cyrus album.  You could guess which one I impulsively brought to the check out.  So I didn't expect much from this album as I gave it is first listen.  But I am glad I bought it honestly!  Here is a track by track review!<br /><br />1. This is Gospel: This sounds a bit like Panics first album, but definitely more poppy.  The song is very upbeat.  At first I thought the \\"If you love me let mego\\" part was too corny and teenpop sounding, but now I find myself fighting not to sing along to it!  After actually listening to the lyrics, the opening and closing beats sound more like a heartbeat to me!  Great single and song to open up this comeback album!  9.5/10<br />2. Miss Jackson feat. Lolo: The comeback song.  At first I thought it was trying too hard to be like Fall Out Boys comeback song, but I honestly like this much more.  It is also more mature with its lyrics.  The chorus is pumping.  Probably one of the best chorus's from the band since \\"I Write Sins...\\".  The songs instrumentals have a hip hop feel to them and Lolos parts are nice and R&B sounding!  Great comeback single.  10/10<br />3. Vegas Lights:  Song starts with kids counting to ten then back to one before the song really starts.  The song has a 80s feel with its synths.  Lyrically it's about nights in Vegas, but the song could easily be played as a backdrop to any party filled crazy nights.  The chorus gets better and better each time I listen to it.  Throughout the song there are background chants of kids chanting \\"5 4 3 2 1\\" and its just catchy.  The bridge part of this song is one of the best parts of the entire album.  Great anthem for Vegas and crazy lifestyles in general!  10/10<br />4. Girl That You Love: The song immediately has a strong 80s influence.  Some parts have a robotic feel which reminds me of Daft Punk.  This is definitely a good trippy song for the club.  The synths and guitars work well together in this song.  9/10<br />5. Nicotine: When I first saw the title of this song I was skeptical because I'm a non smoker.  But the song isn't really about cigarettes at all.  Its mostly contrasting a bad relationship with nicotine.  You want to leave but you can't because you're addicted!  The song also has one of the best rocking guitar riffs of any Panic song.  The chorus is anthem worthy.  The bridge part is almost as good as the one in \\"Vegas Lights\\".  Great catchy song.  9.5/10<br />6. Girls/Girls/Boys:  At first I thought the song was going to be just some \\"OneDirection\\" type pop song.  But it actually has more of the awesome 80s vibes.  The vocals are also some of Brandens most powerful, especially in the chorus.  Oh the chorus.  Probably one of the catchiest chorus's from the band.  This could be a hit single.  I ignore the music video for this song though.  The music video is mostly for the ladies.  Still an undeniably catchy song!  10/10<br />7. Casual Affair:  On first listen I didn't really like this song.  It just sounded off to me.  Then after a few listens I loved it.  The slight orchestral moments in the song are a nice touch too.  The chorus really makes me want to have a casual affair!  Though I love the song now, it's not one of my favorites.  Still good though!  9/10<br />8. Far Too Young to Die:  Another 80s influenced song!  The synths are so perfect.  The chorus is simple, but I love it complimented with the synth riff!  Theres something very emotional about this song for some reason.  9.5/10<br />9. Collar Full: Yes, there's another 80s vibe on this song.  Again at first I thought the chorus was too corny for me.  But now I can't get it out of my head.  The melody is so infectious, especially the \\"whoah oh oh oooh\\" parts!  Nice poppy song.  9.5/10<br />10. The End of All Things:  This might be the greatest song Panic has ever conceived in my opinion.  Its just outright beautiful.  The pianos and strings are heartbreakingly gorgeous.  This is the slowest song from the band, but in my opinion their best song.  The vocals have a robotic/heavenly feel at times.  Sometimes its hard to understand the lyrics, but you can still feel the emotion.  This song alone is worth the purchase of the album honestly!  I wish the song was longer though.  Still, amazing.  I must have listened to it over 50 times already.  Think of that special someone when you listen to this song for a fuller experience.  11/10<br /><br />So this is definitely a great album.  It really gets better with multiple listens like most great albums.  Also, its just a simple and fun pop album.  It's not trying to experiment, not that there's anything wrong with experimentation.  At a mere 32 minutes long, it's just a good straightforward pop album.  This can be seen as a big comeback for the band after their slight falling off with their last album.  I think this is a much better comeback album than Fall Out Boys recent one, which was also produced by Butch Walker.  Dare I say it?  This album might be their best overall album so far in their career.  Yes, I'm saying its better than \\"Fever\\" as a whole.  I found myself skipping songs on that album many times honestly.  All in all, great great simple yet infectious comeback album.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|I remember recording this off of MTV when it first aired and had Breeders and Cypress Hill also. Finally a more complete show of Nirvana's LIVE & LOUD. Not sure if they even did more but this is the Holy Grail for sure.<br /><br />There have been other live performances released but to me this is the most rocked out Nirvana show that is officially released.<br /><br />The sound is mind blowing awesome. I remember on my original VHS recording off of MTV the stereo was more dominant on one channel but this is absolute perfection.<br /><br />I guess the only wish if it were film and in 16:9 with Bluray. But it was for TV and in '93 so absolutely no complaints.<br /><br />Why it took 20 years, no idea but FINALLY!! :D
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Excellent quality and splendidly designed so every fan should have them in their collection to support their favorite TV show. Love it so much!

B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love this show, so obviously I'm grateful to Amazon for the opportunity to have these discs. Excellent quality and every fan should have them in their collection to support their favorite TV show.<br />Just a pity that I have to go every time far enough to pick up the order, because the courier service doesn't deliver to my city, and every time I have to have time off from work and pay extra for the road and go two hours to the next city to take my order​​. This is the only thing that saddens.
1616550414|4.0|I think this book is excellent to add to your collection, the art is priceless and the story inside has great value as well
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Excellent quality and splendidly designed so every fan should have them in their collection to support their favorite TV show.
030758836X|1.0|I'm not one to write reviews unless absolutely necessary.  This book was awful and a total waste of time.  The only good thing about this read was I borrowed the book from the library and didn't spend a penny.  Then I would have been really upset.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is very replayable<br />this is a fun game for all ages<br />this game is better than some of the other car games I have played
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book. It made me re-think how I perceive abilities to perform certain types of work. It also brings forth the idea that the most commonly help view of intelligence is was too simplistic and that we must consider emotion, social, and other forms of intelligence beyond logic or pattern recognition. Many times we put our own barriers in front of ourselves and take away opportunities to try new things because we think \\"only someone like ___ could do that\\".<br /><br />However, as the old addege goes \\"practice makes permanent; it doesn't make perfect.\\" I must call the reader to question the assertion that 10,000 hours or more will make you an expert and the inference that much of what brings about success is the sheer amount of time invested in learning a skill. It is important to realize we often stop short in learning something; yet, it is also important to realize that while you could spend tons of hours learning something that there may be a particular thing you simply enjoy doing more than another or that you're simply better at. Motivation must not be a forgotten factor as it plays a pivotal role in driving us to become great; rather than just good.<br /><br />Overall, much food for thought. I highly recommend it!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love the plots and the actors.  Enjoyable current show involving Law, politics and family life.  Some I watched more than once.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|This game kept me occupied for a long time. Wish there were more levels.Great game which advances through levels with a chance to set your personal performance.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It's a suspenseful romantic movie.  It grabbed our attention from beginning untl end.  They should make more movies like this.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|It does as advertised and does it well for being free. I highly recommend this app. It's definitely worth your time if you're looking for good utilities.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book is perfect I live the twist and the book said the end before I knew it was over 😭 anyhow I loved it and if you love romance/lots and lots of drama this book would be your soulmate🎀
B00EU9VCKO|2.0|I agree with another reviewer when referring to this &quot;free&quot; app for today...ADS show up asking me if I want the &quot;PAID&quot; version!!! Haven't even tried the &quot;regular free&quot; one yet. Confusing to say the least!! Wouldn't you agree? Get &quot;with it&quot; XnView!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome it's a very good pass time<br />It took me in the world like I had an actually horse I know that sounds stupid but that's how good of a game this is
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|The insights and evidence provided in this book give more than enough reasons for a radical, revolutionary change to how we educate our children. It is now clear to me that we must make substantive changes and we must do so without delay.
B00FHG19T8|2.0|I recently went on a long business trip (October 9th). I downloaded this MP3 and hit the road.  I gave it a good listen all the way through, which was not easy.  There were only a couple of songs that touched me.  Not to be quick to judge I proceeded to listen to every other Amos Lee recording I had (which is all of his music), and I came back to MOSROS and nothing changed. I guess for me the combination of Lee's past music offerings kept my attention.  His heartfelt lyrics (Learned a Lot, Darkness, The Wind, Violin etc), and his toe tapping songs (Truth, Jesus, Cup of Sorrow, Street corner preacher) showcase his true spirit.  This spirit seems lacking, or straight out missing on this recording. I don't see this as an evolution, but more of a detour. I understand he recorded this with his touring band, which is also disappointing since the last time I saw him I was awed by his performance.<br /> I will hold out and hope the next offering will take Amos back to his roots, that combination of soul, folk, and lyrical mastery that has made him my favorite artist for several years now.<br />Just doesn't feel RIGHT for me......
0399224459|5.0|My 2 y/o makes me read this book on repeat.  After the fourth time I try to sneak in a different book and he shoves Good Night, Gorilla back in my face like I'm an idiot for reading the wrong book.<br /><br />I also have the board book in Spanish that I leave in his crib so he can read to himself as he settles down to sleep.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is an amazing game it is kid friendly i give it a five out of five so much fun to play
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a fan and great admirer of Stephen King and his work since I borrowed Skeleton Crew from the library (at the ripe old age of ten or eleven). The Shining scared and fascinated me to the point of throwing it in the trash one night as a teenager and then digging it out to continue the next morning.  I was so eager to read Dr. Sleep, and was immediately drawn in by the adult Dan Torrence and his winding path to redemption. Dan's sacrament and gift are beautiful and scary at once. I loved the references to Charlie Manx and Christmas Land (another terrific book by Joe Hill, part of King's Ka-tet).  I loved the intrigue and strange love among the True Knot.  And I loved Abra and Momo, and the beautiful idea of the love and power between elders and the young. Jack Torrence makes an appearance, and the wheel of life turns in this book.  We, the Constant Readers, have been given a terrific sequel that is a completely satisfying story.  Thanks SK!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app. so far no problems at all. u should get this if ur a my little pony fan like me. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!! RAINBOWDASH RULES!!
0761174192|5.0|I have been buying the Cat Gallery Calendar for years for several cat lovers in our family.  Occasionally we find a picture that is the spitting image of one of the cats or grandcats!
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Series is good. Looking forward to the next book. This is the third  I've read in the series.<br />Thanks a lot.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great read. On par with DeMille's earlier works. Had a hard time putting book down. One of my favorite John Corey books.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This is an incredible story, presented in dazzling picture and sound that will cause you to watch this Christmas movie, all year long. The voice talent of Jim Carrey and the picture talents of Disney, this DVD is worth the price.
0385474547|3.0|the book came in good condition!! but the cover page is not what as posted. The cover page is full orange. The author’s name is on top and bottom of the page. in the center of the page, has a darker orange color which is a square. in it shows the title and diagonally is a picture. the rest is still light orange. basically u will see a big square in the middle as the center image, and witin the square will be smaller squares going diagonally with darker orange. sorry hope u got the image idea.<br /><br />it did come the date it said as the estimated delivery date, which was a bout a week.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|Didn't see the movie, so it isn't what I expected, really enjoyed it<br />I would recommend it to anyone who has or hasn't seen the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best! (: I have had this game about a year and I'm still playing! I just wish i knew how to keep up with updating it on my KINDLE each month. After awhile I had trouble getting the update :(
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|I continue to purchase the DVD, watch and enjoy, and then give to a grandchild.  Soon I miss Nemo enough to purchase another one...I'll never learn.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is a great game over all. It has good graphics ( which is always a plus ) it also gives you a good thrill when you are being charged by some angry animal trying it's hardest to kill you. This is a great game and should be downloaded if you are a hunter.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|It was fun to think about completing a list of my own, but frustrating the she did not pick up he was a cop sooner.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|this album is from start to finish an arc in life from adore to someone else. you can see from the heartbreaking ballads that this is genuine. i think her true talent will be appreciated after the controversy of her acting like the kid she is dies away.all young people go through the rebel phase. she just happens to be producing great songs out of it.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I think Cheryl Strayed told a very compelling story.  Many times in life we are looking for answers to our problems whether it be from others, substance use or looking within.  She tried all any only succeeded with the latter.  She looked for love but again, she had to love herself, before she could again begin to love others.
0345529057|5.0|I have not starting reading these yet,  but they are big and heavy.  They hold my door open like a champ.  I used to use my collected Shakespeare to do that but this set is more colorful.<br /><br />Once I read them I will report back.
B00D1VKZ3M|1.0|Unfortunately the author has got this sequel all wrong. Almost as bad as the demented plot lines in Bridget's supposed screenplay.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Slightly better than the mobile site.<br /><br />If it gave me free stuff I would like it more.<br /><br />Good if you need to contact customer service for the
0763619612|5.0|Fun and interactive.  It holds a child's attention for multiple readings. The colors and instructions are very entertaining.  My granddaughter loves it.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|So I download this app to my phone and I am all like &#34;Shazam!&#34; and nothing happens.  I try again, nothing.  Turns out this app will not turn you into Captain Marvel or give you any other powers.  It does however listen to music and tell you what the song is.  I guess that is cool too.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|What can I say? I love Dexter even if that means I must be a little warped.... I waited for what felt like a year for Season 7 and watched the entire season back to back.....now I have to wait for the next one to come out!!
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|The case fits well. It is well made. It isn't too thick and seems like it will protect the phone in a drop.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love how easy it is to connect with (old) long time friends, and family, I have learned a lot of interesting things.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is pretty fun game. I would recommend you to get it. ;)  but all you do Is collect money from the animals and u can create th  village. Though some things r pretty pricey when  u get in a higher level.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|Love the game Carcassonne! Both the board game and this app. The ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is it only has one of the expansions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it! The lava is number one,but a laser blaster for survival and creative would be awesome! Also I want the blaster to be made out of 5 cobblestone and it should so 2 heart damage along the blaster being indestructible
B000I5SY5U|3.0|It now seems very dated and not important. Did not like Liza Minelli. Generally was boring and did not give much insight into the period of time.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It was a great game to play but the graphics were a little faulty and the dragons in gold looked stupid in the light
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is one of the best shows produced in the last decade. The acting is flawless, the casting perfect and the writing couldn't be more clever. The only downside is each season is only 3 episodes!
0446699616|4.0|If you ever spent time in the mid-East, you'll relate to the scenes in Yemen.  And the central character's wise guy comments.  Sample ...&#34; This place has come a long way.  They've opened an off Broadway theatre.  Currently showcasing the long running musical called 'Guys and Goats.'  'I've got the goat right here, his name is Al-Amir!'
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|Three further tales that are sure to enchant are inside this E-book.  I view them all as more than African-American folklore.  I view them all as folklore that will entertain anyone.  &#34;Why Newly Born Babies Can't Talk&#34; is worth its price, and I think that it's priceless storytelling.
0545123291|5.0|Great read. My daughter loved the book. It is a series to a couple other books which are all good
B00992CF6W|5.0|u gotz to buy itz. itz like a heaven in yo kindle. i think that if yo haterz gunna not buyz it yo should all die.

B00DDXJRJG|3.0|I guess I need to ask my son to help me set the equalizer for max. sound.  I'm just not smart enough to work it.
B007I0K672|5.0|This book completely re-examined my attitude toward learning. I am, or hopefully was, one of those students with the fixed mindset she describes in the book. I've been told that I'm smart, intelligent at the young age. As such, I believe that I must be, since my parents keep telling me so. This is detrimental toward my attitude toward school and learning, as I started to see learning as something done to gain approvals and get good grades. This makes me shun challenges, just as the kids Dweck studied. I only studied the bare minimum required to get a good grade. Basically, I only studied what the teachers said will be on the test and so on. I often crammed for tests and finals, thinking if I study beforehand, that's trying too hard and that means I'm not as smart as I believe. Sometimes, I get lucky with cramming at the last minute and managed to do well but for the most part, I did not get good grades or learn much from my classes. This book explained so much of behaviors and my aversion to actual, genuine studying. I'm currently in the process and reforming my mindset not just toward learning in school but toward learning everything, including trying to change my moody temperament. The one area my psyche is still resisting toward changing is the relationship department. My view toward it seems to be very black and white still. Hopefully, as I start to see progress and the benefits of adopting a growth mindset in other aspects of my life, I can start to learn manage the relationships in my life in a more effective and proactive way.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie, but I found out how great it is.  This is a real keeper to see again and again.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I have this app on my Android PHONE. I love. I downloaded it for Kindle Fire seeing if it works exactly the same. It does, except for:<br />1. Every time I download a video as a video, it won't allow me to play the video, and<br />2. I download it as music, but when I try to play the song, nothing happens.<br />I really hope you will fix these issues. Once their fixed, I will rate higher
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|One of the better hidden object games.  Very good if you like these types of games. Passes the time very quickly. Worth the three dollars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this gome is fun. i enjoy it so much.i also love that each month there is a theme.great job the creator of subway surfers.
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|I have never seen the movie, but it is one of my sons favorites.  We couldn't find it anywhere except on Amazon.  The CD is in great condition!  Thank you!
0765326353|5.0|I became familiar with Sanderson from his other works, like the ending books of the Wheel of Time series, Elantris, and his Alloy books. This book, though, was by far the best of all his works to date. It is not just fantasy, but it is fantasy that motivates the reader to be a better person. I particularly recommend this for young men, as the themes of honor and justice resonate most with male readers, since the characters being developed are going through many manly struggles. Though the work is mancentric, I know several women who also love the book. There's nothing wrong with a cast of characters weighted towards masculinity; after all, it is refreshing to have a great work that is not told from the perspective of a teenage girl or a wimpy teen male.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Great series! The writers have tremendous talent at keeping the audience locked in & on the edge of their seats!  The actors are terrific & totally convincing in their respective roles.  I'm hooked!
B009JVSAVM|1.0|I just love this show! I can watch it over and over again and I never get enough of Sheldon! He makes the show great!
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Crammed with interesting history and information.  Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it.<br />Always well researched.  Can't wait to start the follow up.
B00594XOZU|1.0|what a waste of time ! dosent even let you log in loads too much for nothing 1 star .
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is very addicting. I save up credits so I can play for awhile all at once. Too many pop ups for different games.
B000001F5A|5.0|Ever since I heard of Vangelis, (chariots of fire, to the unknown man, alpha, etc) I've liked his music.  His music is skillfully used to describe what he see's.  In the case of Antarctica, it is wonderfully and artistically done, you can imagine yourself being there.  His music really appeals to your emotions and your mood.
1451695195|5.0|I love this book.  I bought several copies to give to friends.  His description of his remarkable journey is very comforting.
1476733953|5.0|Loved this book for many reasons. Great story telling of post-apocalyptic life in a silo that draws parallels to todays world. Intelligent writing, good character development, engrossing story. Researching the author to learn how this book was written and published was very interesting. Our book group had a great discussion after reading - so much to talk about - and we look forward to reading and discussing the sequels,  SHIFT and DUST.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I have read many of John Grisham's books and enjoyed every one BUT this book will probably be my last.  It was a struggle to get through until I reached about chapter 31 or so.  The buildup to the trial was boring with Wally dragging David all over Chicago to get clients and the trial was a waste until David was on his own and actually asked some good questions of the witness.  Everyone knew what the outcome was going to be so why did it take so many pages to get there?  The characters came across as a bunch of bums with David being the exception.  The only part I really liked was David & Helen's search for Nasty Teeth and the lawsuit against the toy company that sold them.
B00B9B4IYI|3.0|The big plus of the receiver that it connects to digital input on Yummy.  Other receivers connect to analog jacks.  However, the range is not as good as other receivers have.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|After Nightmare, being so freakin` good, I was worried that AX7 would falter a little with Hail To The King. Boy, was I wrong.  M. Shadows continues to be the voice of hard rock/heavy metal. Oh yeah, Synyster Gates, Best Guitarist in the world.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|Wonderful game.great way to make you think...my 88 year old grandmother and myhusband enjoys it...good to take with you when you know have a wait and the best part is that you can play off line
1558803602|4.0|It tells the story of Life and afterlife, sometimes sad, and sometimes funny, but very entertaining. A great cast of actors and actress.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|the story was very interesting.  It wasn't too freighting like i thought it would be. the ending was okay but it was sad.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|The album is really good all the way through. I'd say in many ways I like it better than Black Gives Way to Blue. The drawback for me is that there aren't any songs that push the energy over the edge, which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. I like more total songs on this album than on the one before, but I like my favorites on that album more than my favorites on The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. It's a very sludgy album, which I like, I just kept waiting for it to either pick up the pace or even slow it down a little more. At first I didn't like that the whole album seemed to have the same tone all the way through. I feel music before anything else so it was a difficult first listen because I was anticipating more highs and lows in energy. Because AIC is my favorite band, I listened again all the way through and gave more attention to the details in the music and lyrics. So, I was wrong, it has plenty of slow songs, and all of them good. Also, it has such an intense AIC sound, much more like the non-singles from Dirt and Alice in Chains. They are strange, and dark, and have a bit of a manic quality. So the peaks on this album aren't as high as Black Gives Way to Blue, but the valleys aren't as low either. I can put this album on and listen all the way through without skipping any tracks. I think the guys are doing a phenomenal job of progressing their sound, which is truly unique, and giving true blue fans like myself consistently great music to enjoy.

0743243153|5.0|Every thinking adult should read &#34;The Road Less Traveled&#34; at least once in his life. And then re-read it. It is that good, that profound, that important. You will not be the same person when you finish reading it. If you are untouched by it, then you definitely need to re-read it! Applying it in your life will be difficult, but as Dr. Peck says, &#34;Life is difficult.&#34;

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Rating and commenting on this book is life imitating art!  (I could easily raise my score to 5 stars.). The ending came up on me very unexpectedly (an odd feature of Kindle). I was ready to settle in for Book 3, but settling was not required. This is an interesting example of speculative, not science, fiction because we know this future is here now. Lots to think about. The book somehow brought Hunger Games to mind, particularly Mae's transparency. Like that book and Margaret Atwood's latest, they are driven along by intensive plotting without too much depth. I like the pacing but it also feels like eating too fast -- you still taste the food and get the nourishment, but the experience is not filling. But I highly recommend the book. I like to eat fast.
B000068QKT|4.0|Brest if you love older, artsy, very complex movies with happy endings.  Beautifully done!!  It's a movie you watch over and over
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this game from Amazon's  FAotD and I have to say, I would pay for this game.  The first set of beginner's puzzles are pretty quick and easy.  However I've been working awhile in the second series. I can't imagine how long it will take to finish all the puzzles!<br /><br />The colored, numbered squares help you to figure out where to color in on the board.  It can be tricky! And just when you think you've finished...oh! Something's not right. I have to say it's very satisfying to see the finished image come up when the puzzle is completed perfectly.<br /><br />My favorite part of this whole game is to see the series of pictures I've already completed!<br /><br />Winter is coming - do yourself a favor and get this game...cozy up by a fire or under the blankets with a hot drink. You will spend many happy, comfortable hours with these colorful puzzles.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|See the above. I haven't been far enough in the game to give a far review, but I receive free diamond/currency for writing this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book. Lived up to all the hype. Would have been perfect if the book ended after the surprising finale and not had the last few pages setting up for the next books. Can't wait to check out the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My wife and I have been watching movies from Netflix. Setup was easy-peasy. Now that the Hulu-Plus app is Chromecast ready we will be trying that. the You Tube app works great, too. Only wish that BBC America wasn't doing an exclusive with Apple. A number of things from them I'd like to watch not least of all Classic Dr Who.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Most of what is presented in this book has been said before, but rarely so clearly, succinctly, or eloquently.  Thank you to Mr. Pressfield for demonstrating his topic and showing us what can happen when we \\"show up and do the work\\", even with gritted teeth.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I purchased this tracker as I lost the FitBit Ultra I owned. I was disappointed in that loss so I needed a replacement. (The FitBit units become disengaged from the clothing too easily).<br />I did a bit of research and the Pulse was the best device for me at that time. It is an unobtrusive device, does all I expect plus measures heartbeat, although not always accurately, inks seamlessly with the Withings app, and seems to have a firm clip for attaching to belts and clothing.<br />A couple of improvements could be made: the screen characters could be a lot clearer and the configuration of step distance is not easily managed ... I can't figure it. The kms travelled calculated do not represent the actual distance.. Not that critical as I use this in concert with a GPS. Overall, I happy with my purchase.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Okay, I have to admit, I was totally picturing Zac while I was reading this book, which totally made it that much more enjoyable!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I loved this movie.  I am definitely a sci-fi fan.  The new star trek special effects are brilliant.  Hope there is more.

B007SGM084|4.0|Very good read. I have recommended it. Not what I was expecting after hearing about it from other people that had read it.
B00EYE0ECW|4.0|Liked the map but some stores that have been around for several years still aren't on the map. do you have an update available?
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Don't expect this movie to be The Godfather.<br />I didn't really care what happened to the characters<br />because you really never connect with any of them<br />before they get killed off.<br />Next time I will just rewatch Scarface or any<br />other mob movie.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|A wonderful story which I have watched before. I never tire of seeing it at least once a year, if not more. It has a great story plot and keeps the viewer's interest. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg!  This is the best book ever!! It's so creative and imaginative!!  It has a lot of serious events with a pinch if sadness and romance! If you love strange but awesome books, this is the book for you!!!!!!!
B002YK8OKC|5.0|I love this movie! Must admit some of it is a little off color but it is a must see comedy about just what a family can go through during the holiday season. Chevy Chase is the only one that could have pulled this comedy movie off with his style of humor. The entire cast was wonderful- so many icons from the past-great names in Hollywood. Uncle Eddie was halarious! I will watch this again and again!!!!
B00C5R8364|5.0|I believe I have read almost every one Frederick Forsyth's book and have never been disappointed.  THE KILL LIST Extremely well written, held my interest until the end and I still wanted more.  I could read this book over and over again.  I have also recommended it to my friends as a thriller that they will not be able to put down.  Highly recommended.  Lu Lutz
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Not a brad pitt fan, and he looked like billy ray cyrus in this on with the mullet. Still if you like the walking dead and the whole zombie thing , this movies for you! Great way to start a movie which has endless sequels to the scenario . I liked my family liked im sure you will to.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Great and awesome concert filmed and recorded. This is a must have Madonna item. Will take you back to the concert!

B006LSZECO|3.0|I did like the suspense, but I didn't particularly like the story being told from each character in their on chapter.  That's just my feeling.  But overall it was a good novel.

B000OP1M6M|5.0|This watch arrived on time and in perfect condition. The watch is better looking in person then the picture in the ad. The watch was easy easy to set up and is keeping good time. This watch fits in well in a casual environment but might not be a good fit in an office or dress setting. The only negative things to date are it did not come with a Seiko warrenty but it came with a third party warrenty. I was also dissapointed that the watch is not considered safe for swimming. I found this odd for a dive watch. All in all I would reccomend this watch.

006091307X|1.0|I started this book 20 years ago and got about a quarter through it. Tried again last week and got to page 35. Whatever Post-Modern means, who cares? Cormac McCarthy had been writing almost contemporaneously with Pynchon, but his books, at the least the first 5 through Blood Meridian (1985) (the second greatest American 20th Century novel after 'Lolita') will still be read 50 or 100 years from now. Because the prose, the themes, are timeless and the writing is superb. But sorry, I was reviewing Lot 49, and can't add much to the other one star reviews, which are usually 'slammed as Not Helpful', even the ones much more thorough than mine. Since I'm not a poor college student forced to read the entire book, I won't. And for the scorners, is it not the case that if you like a book, you know 25 to 50 pages into it?  I tried Vineland, then Mason and Dixon, and likewise threw up my hands and picked up something by Faulkner, Nabokov, Kerouac, O'Connor, Roth, Nin, etc.<br />  What do I hate about this book? Dated language, dead cultural references, smug tone, mannequins for characters, names like Fallopian and Sick Dick. (I would have pissed myself with laughter reading those names when I was 17.) My opinion,just my opinion, skip this and try Dharma Bums, or Invisible Man, or Miss Lonelyhearts, or American Pastoral,or Dr. Glas, or Outer Dark, or Under A Glass Bell, or Naked Lunch, or anything Faulkner wrote )other than Intruder In The Dust.) Yes, this is an off-topic review, touting my own favorites, but I figure a hundred times more eyes will see it than if I posted a review of something by Hjalmar Soderberg or Nathaniel West. They are not as popular as Pynchon, or Stephen King, or Stephenie Meyer, or Danielle Steel, or as James Michener and Arthur Hailey used to be.

140006922X|5.0|A fascinating and illuminating work about the historical Jesus of Nazareth, and the earliest days of the followers he inspired.<br /><br />If you're looking for a hagiography that glorifies the Son of God, you've come to the wrong place -- read, instead, some of those things published by the likes of the Zondervan Publishing Company. But like those, this is written by a Believer -- just one with the academic chops to make his research more meaningful in serious circles.<br /><br />His conclusions will startle the conservative Christians, enlighten those on the theological fence, and confirm the thoughts of those atheists like me, that Jesus was a good and thoughtful man whose message was perverted early on by a certain man called Paul. Salvation through faith alone? That's nonsense -- it means a man like Hitler, or Pol Pot, or Stalin, would go to a heaven in exchange for a quick and heartfelt conversion on their deathbeds, negating all the evil they did on earth. And it means those like Gandhi, Gautama Buddha, and Stephen Hawking, whose works have truly improved the quality of life on earth for all, are condemned to a hell after death, for NOT making that Profession of Faith.<br /><br />How much sense does that make?<br /><br />Highly recommended to all. Sadly, the people who most need to hear this message will not read it, as heretical. Yes, it may be somewhat heretical according to conventional &#34;Christian&#34; standards, but I think the historic Jesus, and his brother James, would heartily approve of it.<br /><br />&#34;Finally,&#34; they'd say, &#34;someone has got it right.&#34;
0140072187|5.0|Flying is freedom, just taking in the scenery below is impressive; the ability to alight in a meadow wonderful. Planning where to go, manipulating cyclic and stick becomes a challenge; smooth landings icing on the cake. However, when someone below is trying to shoot you, and you persist in landing, it turns into a nightmare. The adult mind should not/would not do it voluntarily. That seems to be why the Army chose young men as Warrant Officers- too young to be completely conditioned with adult mindsets.<br />Viet Nam was our first conflict for helicopter assaults. Deep grass or blowing dust, it was never predictable. Conditions were not like stateside training. One landing turned expensive:<br />'Roots and leafless bushes stuck up wildly at the extreme end of the strip. When I flared, the rotor wash stirred up the dust and everything vanished. I felt the ship hit something. I thought it sounded like a stump coming up through the belly, which happened pretty often on assaults, so I elected to land a few feet farther ahead. Which way was ahead? Which way was up? There were only seconds to figure it out. The compass showed that we were turning to the right. I pushed the left pedal to stop the spin. It didn't work.<br />This was a tail rotor failure. The solution was to chop the power quickly to stop the ship from rotating under the main rotors, and then do a hovering autorotation. We had practiced this routine in flight school.... The ship hit and twisted on the skids, rocked over toward the left, hesitated precariously, and flopped back level.' She could have rolled over and beat the ground until the rotors disintegrated. Back where he tried to land, two feet up, a scrawny root showed a fresh gouge. The tailrotor gearbox and turbine were trashed. Eventually, the write-off was $100,000. (p. 259-60)<br />Like Red Badge of Courage, the carnage is gruesome. Choppers often returned from battle with casualties. These landed at the medical pad. The dead were stacked in one place, that crews must walk past:<br />'A new gunner, a black kid who had until recently been a grunt, had come over with me and Leese. We stayed back, but he had gone closer to the pile of bodies just to look. He started wailing and crying and Pulling at the corpses and had to be dragged away. He had seen his brother at the bottom of the heap.' (p.223-4)<br />Too often, these abused men had trouble readjusting to civilian life. Mason's mind may never be able to encompass everything that happened. The Army has changed since then; but guerrilla warfare is still the same.<br />See also: [[ASIN:0140158766 Chickenhawk: Back in the World: Life After Vietnam]], [[ASIN:0553577050 Firebirds: The Best First Person Account of Helicopter Combat in Vietnam Ever Written]], [[ASIN:1608448177 The Shadow of Death: A Story of Marine Helicopter Crews in the Viet Nam War, 1966-67]].

0062218867|3.0|This book was not a full-throttle Terry Pratchett book. He has early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and plans to turn the books over to his daughter Rhianna (who is also a writer). I suspect &#34;Snuff&#34; is a book written during the turnover. Not bad, but it's more on a level with his &#34;Truckers&#34; than the peak Discworld novels,.
0553573403|1.0|This book just wasn't that interesting.  I don't mind lengthy books, as long as they are able to keep my interest.  I could put this book down for days at a time, and only picked it back up when I forced myself to.  The story had too many points of view.  I would get into a character's story, and then have to wade through over 100 pages of the other characters' drama before I got back to the character that I actually liked.  The author rotates point of view, so each chapter is told through another character.  I liked Danny's character, but she only showed up every 100 pages.  The same was true of the other characters. This is a bit annoying since they are each in a different location, dealing with different problems.  I'm assuming all of the story lines will begin to mesh together, but I'm already over 600 pages in, and I just don't feel it's worth it anymore.  If you like hearing a story from one or two points of view, skip this story.  Too many storylines to follow.  You have to read too much rubbish before you get to anything that even begins to resemble an interesting story.

1572815108|4.0|I watched a youtube documentary about Aleister Crowley and was fascinated by his life so when I discovered there was a tarot deck made specifically under his directions, I thought I had to have it. I'm only a novice tarot spread reader but the deck seems very well painted and it's zen-like beauty will provide some insight to those willing to take the time and meditate.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|A great and encompassing story. Good character development and interesting twists.  I like how it follows history and the characters are woven in. I also liked that through the eyes of each character you see the reality of the times and people's attitudes towards the events and other people.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|WAS NOT BETTER THEN SEASON 1. If you're looking for something like the first season 1 it is not this one. But other then that it wasn't that bad, It took me about 3 times to watch the 1st episode to get into but I did. I love pepper and this show wouldn't be shit without Jessica Lange.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This was one heck of a ride.  I'm always in awe of King 's abilities.  I didn't give it top billing, only because it was hard to grasp in some places.  That never took away from the story though.  The failing might have been mine.  I stayed away from King for years.  I overdosed and became comatose.  Started reading healthier.  Just wandered back for the \\"feel\\"  again.  Didn't disappoint.

Every person has certain areas where they respond to love from others.  When we find out what those are, we can show our love to them by how we relate to them.  This is an easy book to read.
B008220DGE|2.0|One for Joaquin Phoenix, the other for Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Phoenix is either a genius or completely mad--or perhaps both.  The acting in this movie was fantastic, but the rest of it was horrible.  My husband will never forgive my for suggesting we watch it.  When it was done, he said &#34;There's two hours and eleven minutes of my life I'll never get back.&#34;  Too true.
1579128955|5.0|As an elementary school librarian,  I've had a great deal of fun getting students charged up on reading about the 'building blocks of the universe'...atoms...by introducing them to this wonderful book. With it's fabulous pictures and layers and layers of information, it is a book that can easily 'grow' with a child....catching their interest in their earlier years with the photography, and their understanding increasing each year as they gain more knowledge of the elements in their science classes. I've lost count of the number of budding young scientists who've put this book on 'hold', or who have 'renewed' the book over and over again. There are many elements books on the market, and I've yet to see any of them come close to the quality of this one. Simply fabulous for both the young and old, both parents and their children have read and enjoyed it. I highly recommend this book. It's a 'keeper' in every sense of the word.
B000FC0P9E|3.0|&#34;She had somehow gotten out of bounds, wandered off the playing field and into a place where the rules she was used to no longer applied.&#34;<br />from Stephen King's &#34;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&#34;<br /><br />Stephen King's &#34;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&#34; is not like his other macabre books of horror and all things freakish and creepy. There's plenty of creep, but the horror is not supernatural nor alien. It's the horror of the common, and how the ordinary human mind (and body) deal with extraordinary circumstances. <br /><br />Nine-year-old Trisha is on a hiking trip with her recently divorced mother and older brother in the Maine woods. She steps off the trail to pee and can't find her way back. With a backpack full of picnic food, and a portable radio, Trisha is alone, lost and wandering. King's story is about Trisha's survival, which includes time spent with Tom Gordon, ace closer for her beloved Boston Red Sox.<br /><br />&#34;...there were teeth hidden in the ordinary texture of things...&#34;<br /><br />King's language is always precise and exquisitely chosen. In quintessential Stephen King, as Trisha slides down a hill, she imagines herself...&#34;screaming and waving her arms as she went down; saw a dead branch punching through the under-shelf of her jaw and up between her teeth, tacking her tongue to the roof of her mouth like a red memo, then spearing into her brain and killing her.&#34;<br /><br />Some dangers she faces are real, while others are imaginary. Though it only barely makes a difference as the length of her wanderings stretches into days. &#34;Her giving way to panic wasn't sudden...but weirdly gradual, a drawing in from the world, a shutting down of ouert awareness. She walked faster without minding her way; called for help without hearing her own voice; listened with ears that might not have heard a returning shout from behind the nearest tree. And when she began to run she did it without realizing.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&#34; is a short novel at only a shade over 250 pages. As with all of King's work, it's an engaging and fast read. Unlike most of King's work, I didn't find this story quite as rich and vibrant, nor his treatment of Tisha as poignant nor affecting as usual. <br /><br />King threads Tom Gordon into the story through Tisha's spurious connection to the outside world through the BoSox games she listens to on her radio (with ever-dwindling batteries), and spectral appearances he makes to her throughout her meandering journey through the woods. There's one surprisingly emotional moment as she listens to the BoSox on the radio and hears her idol battle the hated Yankees in the ninth inning.<br /><br />&#34;She was lost but would be found. She was sure of it. Tom Gordon had gotten the save and so would she.&#34;4;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&#34; is a short novel at only a shade over 250 pages.

0385351399|5.0|What if we could know everything - not through supernatural power, but through the entirely physical power of technology? That's the unsettling question Dave Eggers poses in his new novel, THE CIRCLE. By turns hilarious and hideous, it chronicles the rise of one Mae Holland: at first a faceless and almost nameless Customer Experience technician, then a relentless social (media) climber, and at last...a certain creature in a vast aquarium by which she's fascinated. Which one? No spoilers here!<br /><br />The one fault I found with this book is that Mae and her colleagues are rather ill-defined in terms of their thoughts and feelings. The Circle network itself claims to value such human expression, but is that the real truth? Overall, a mesmerizing read...<br /><br />...\\"and not everything that can be counted counts.\\" --Albert Einstein
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Love this doll. Had trouble choosing between this one and American Girl baby - this one is way better. Aside from the fact that this baby has a soft vanilla sent which my daughter loves - the face and features are &#34;gentler&#34; than the American Girl one, cheeks nice and rosy, lips sweet. Very happy with our choice - oh and not to mention - cheaper doll and clothes from Corolle.

B001NLL0RW|5.0|I got hooked on this series after picking up The Last Oracle in an airport on a flight home.  I have read all books in the series up to this one after backtracking to the beginning of the series.  None have disappointed and this is right on track to be very entertaining about half way in.  Highly recommend the series.
B00005ASOC|5.0|There is no profound overly self-indulgent touchy-feely sentiment in FINDING FORRESTER. Everything in this film is genuine, it feels genuine. That is what I like about it and makes it stand far above other films that would talk down or preach down to its audience with an almost artificial sense of solicited emotional response. At no time does this film have a veneer of false sentiment. You react and feel to what you see and hear on the screen. This film makes a uniquely personnel connect with its viewer and that is the power and wonderment of this film. I do not think I have seen Sean Connery gives a better performance. Sean Connery is Forrester, a reclusive and enigmatic writer who once wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book and then virtually disappeared from the literary world. By certain events he comes in contact with a Black teenager named Jamal who is attending a prestigious private high school. Forrester begins to mentor Jamal in his writing in a class of professor Robert Crawford (F. Murray Abraham) with certain stipulations.  Sean Connery's Forrester and his \\"take me or leave me\\" attitude throughout this film is something to savor. But that \\"take me or leave me\\" attitude is not what defines Forrester. That is sort of his veneer that fends off the outside world, from the private world within him and it is the world of the literary mind. Jamal is the only person that he has ever given a glimpse of that world. This is a fascinating, moving and uplifting film.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is well written with a satisfyingly complicated plot.  The author takes you with her on a reluctant journey of discovery.  She takes you on a walk down a long dark hall and you have your hands over your open eyes while holding your breath.  The language is rich and the characters are real with their own unique strengths and flaws.  I would quibble a little with parts of the ending -- not as well developed as the most of the book.  All in all a good read.

B005LAII44|2.0|This is a very......action-packed movie.<br /><br />In fact, it's so action-packed that the producers seemed to have forgotten about developing a good plot. The storyline is OK (still better than Twilight), but it's not the greatest. However, there were some surprises that I wasn't expecting.<br />(a) The character played by Channing Tatum dies within the first 20 minutes of the film<br />(b) London is annihilated. Completely. I was shocked and a bit dismayed...<br /><br />However, that was really it.<br /><br />It's a fine movie if you like all the explosions and care less about the plot, but just bring earmuffs for the cacophony of booms.

Ms. Strayed has a real gift for engaging the reader - she shared real insight into her life that lends weight to her fictional writing as well.
0743270754|5.0|Just - wow!  Admit I approached this enormous volume with some trepidation - could even a subject as vast and fascinating as the life and death of Abraham Lincoln hold my interest for so long?  The answer is a resounding yes!  This riveting and superbly-told tale of Lincoln's life and political career not only held my interest: it kept me up nights, pinned me at home on beautiful weekend afternoons, and had me turning down invitations for lunch so that I could bolt down my food while reading.<br /><br />Obviously, Doris Kearns Goodwin is a wonderful storyteller.  But it helps that her protagonist is such an extraordinary individual.  Over and over again I was amazed by Lincoln's wisdom, his decency, his patience, and his extraordinary political acumen.  Goodwin's intent here, it's pretty clear, is to focus on the latter of these attributes.  While most Americans know of Lincoln's moral courage, his political legacy, and (of course) his exemplary oratorical skills, few (I'm betting) fully appreciate his political genius.  Over and over again he pulls political miracles out of his hat - pulling victory out of defeat, forging unforgeable compromises  - armed with little more than an unwavering moral compass, an encompassing empathy, humility, patience, and a seemingly endless stock of jokes, puns, and folksy anecdotes.  Few anecdotes illustrate his politicla genius as clearly as the fact that he staffed the major posts of his new cabinet with political rivals .... or that, in time, those same rivals became his most adamant supporters.<br /><br />I thought I had a fairly good background knowledge of Lincoln's life and his administration, but by the end of the second chapter I jettisoned this misconception.  Goodwin's scholarship is as exceptional as her storytelling skills.  Scarcely a page passed without exposing me to some startling new bit of information, constantly enhancing or challenging my preconceived notions.<br /><br />There are so many lessons here that I wish modern politicians would embrace:  do the right thing for the right reasons, no matter how unpopular; always allow your political opponents to save face; invite - don't avoid (or worse, squash)-  dissenting opinions; compromise always trumps conflict; and, above all, always put the good of the nation above your own personal ambitions.  Alas, since our politicians seem to be too busy doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons, humiliating each other, squashing dissenting opinions, seeking out conflict, and placing their own interests above those of the country, perhaps it's up to us U.S. citizens to absorb the lessons from this book on their behalf and then let them know the standards against which we intend to hold them accountable!<br /><br />I don't give out many 5 star ratings, but if I could give this 6 stars, I would.  This is one of those rare volumes that has permanently changed the way that I view our country, our political system, our destiny, and - above all - the potential of ordinary Americans to accomplish extraordinary things.
1401207529|5.0|This is a book that collects the \\"Batman\\" single issues #404-407, as well as around 20 pages of extra content, written by one of the very top writers of the time. It was made in 1986, and the art reflects this time period. Todays comic book art has become so detailed and refined, this book definetly feels like its from the 80's. I decided to read this as Scott Snyder's current \\"Batman: Zero Year\\" is coming out, and they pay much repects/honor to this Year One book, which I wanted to make sure I understood. This book was the first retelling of the origin story of Batman since the original in 1939 by the creators of the character. You can also tell many aspects of this book have been takin straight out of this story, and integrated into the Christopher Nolan Batman movies as well as other things. I really enjoyed the building relationship between Batman and Gorden, with Gorden coming to terms with the fact that Gotham City actually does benefit from a vigilante hero. I would recommed this book to my friends who wanted to see a classic batman begining. Just as a side note, there is a pretty great animated movie based on this book if you enjoy the story.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|I admit, there are a lot of newer Elton John albums I don't know that well, but's that because I thought he had lost the spark. The Diving Board brings it roaring back. If you remember the first US release, the eponymous &#34;Elton John&#34;, and the writing that went into &#34;Border Song&#34;, &#34;Your Song&#34;, or, especially, the incredible &#34;Greatest Discovery&#34;, well then, you WILL like The Diving Board. Wonderful writing from Bernie Taupin, simple arrangements delivered with heart and soul. Bravo, Sir Elton; bravi to you both!

B00CP4RZCU|5.0|I got his one and have been listening to it non-stop.<br /><br />Couple very good stand out items to note, yes, it is live. Also; note the title - Unblackened - These are a lot of the songs we all know and love some slower, more piano and some just live.<br /><br />The production and sound quality is perfect. I usually hate live albums, There are less than 10 I actually like, this is at the top of my list now.<br /><br />This is not your typical BLS album, But the truth be told, Zakk is not your typical musician.  This just highlights how much the talent of Zakk and the boys can really shine.<br /><br />I love this album and can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />SDMF all the way! Texas Chapter

B000002LGQ|5.0|This is the album that started it all. Before Like A Prayer's release, Madonna was known as a sweet-voiced singer with catchy but shocking pop tunes and controversial videos. On this record's predecessor, True Blue, she began to flirt with maturity and show critics and the public more of what she was capable of, but it's on Like A Prayer that her reach for artistry truly comes to fruition. Make no mistake, this is still very much a pop record, but it's a pop record with quite a bit of depth, substance, and good sense, more than most pop stars display and indeed, more than Madonna had ever displayed in her music before. Madonna co-wrote all of the tunes, mostly with Pat Leonard, who would go on to co-write and co-produce her other mega-selling commercial smash Ray of Light, although a couple songs were co-written and produced by Stephen Bray, with whom she worked on \\"True Blue.\\" From the opening number, title track and hit first single, it's evident this is a whole new Madonna. \\"Like A Prayer\\" boasts a gospel choir, churning electric guitars, and a stunning back-and-forth between pop sugar and dark, soulful rock drama. Madonna further displays her newfound musical growth on gorgeously hummable tunes like the poignant, sweetly mournful \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", which boasts a sublimely beautiful chorus and sweeping, emotional ballads \\"Promise to Try,\\" \\"Oh Father\\", and \\"Spanish Eyes.\\" The latter two are particularly powerful and two of my favorites on the entire record. Never fear, though, there's still some classic Madonna pop material, such as anthem and hit single \\"Express Yourself\\", the buoyant, shimmering ear candy of \\"Cherish,\\" and the catchy, upbeat \\"Keep It Together\\", which sings the praises of family and togetherness. Perhaps the crown jewel of the collection, for me at least, is the delightful \\"Dear Jessie,\\" which utilizes spectacular Beatles-esque harmonies and strings and pristine, beautiful vocals. I fell head over heels in love with this song the first time I heard it. Capping everything off is the cool, funky two-minute outro \\"Act of Contrition.\\" A lot of people don't like it, but I find it hilarious and different and awesome. Like A Prayer is the album that truly began Madonna's amazing journey into true musical artist and mature woman and it is definitely not to be missed. A modern classic.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I hadn't read a young adult fiction novel for a while, probably since high school, which would be some 8 years ago, and I was surprised at how affected I was by this book. It made me laugh, it made me cry (streaming tears), and it made me reevaluate my life. And I did not think a 16 yr old narrator would do that. A beautiful, touching story that I highly recommend.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Great story. Great CGI effects. The story moved well with no dull moments. Exciting with just the right amount of tension. Nice mystery with a satisfying ending.

1476729085|4.0|I won't go into detail about the plot since so many others have already done so.  The story is about a mild \\"aspie\\" who decides to logically and rationally find a wife.  Of course, this process doesn't work, and his life is thrown into (ultimately good) turmoil when Rosie, a barmaid, walks into his life.  The main character is endearing and very likable.  Rosie is also a very likable character; however, the other characters in the book are a bit superficial.  The story is also funny without being disrespectful or condescending.  It bogged down a little in the middle, but overall it is a good read.

B0055MBQOM|2.0|I am about to post a formal review on different websites to exposed these false claims about Projector calibration unless they can find a real way to do this.<br />Basically, all I get is that it could not detect a projected image no matter how bright I had the projector going.<br />Called tech support and their &#34;brilliant&#34; suggestion was to have lights on when calibrating! He dared told me that it would not affect the calibration. Well, I had to use a pretty strong light shinning on the screen for this to work and even then, it ends up with a horrible image because its NOT calibrating to my projector really. Home Theater Projectors are normally when calibrated, ran at a not too bright level as it is intended for movie watching so if this thing is sold as able to calibrate Projectors, it should be able to see that. Even when pushed to max brightness and lamp power, it did not see the image.<br />Totally false, half working features.<br />If they fix this I will update...for now, if you need to calibrate your projector...dont buy this!
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Well I bought the new CD because I've been a Sheryl Crow fan since her first record. Knowing  it was going to be a country format I was hoping for one song that was not . But oh well maybe the next CD . As you can tell I'm not a big fan of country music. I like some though. So I did I give it 5 stars ? Like I said I'm a huge fan. I traveled three times this summer to see her concerts. (the longest 400 miles one way)  Well the 5 stars are for her voice and music . I could listen to her sing anything about any subject . So if your a country music lover buy it. If your a true fan buy it. Like Sheryl says when you buy the music it's your way of voting. Her one song all so says A change will do you good . So vote, I did .
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Very good read.  The strengths outweigh the weaknesses.<br /><br />Weakness: the style reads like Ayn Rand, or some lame attempt at narrative. The main character is an odd blend of social ineptitude and yet social mastery; never really quite made sense. Not much on character development therefore.<br /><br />That said, classical novel elements are not what's key here.  The plot line is well developed, and the themes - really the point of this book - are well-played out.  I did have a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />This book gets well beyond the cliched critiques of spending too much time online, substituting surface relationships for online relationships. Those themes are there, but very well sketched out. For example, the disease of reciprocal linking to the point of meaninglessness; the triviality of online reviews; the vapidity of references, are all laid out in fairly scary connect-the-dots fashion from today on.<br /><br />The deeper issues have to do with the cult of authenticity, a two-edged concept. It contains within it both an element of transparency, and an element of genuineness. The novel points out how scarily difficult it is to have both; in a contest, transparency wins out, and destroys genuineness.

0316223239|4.0|This is a good read, but my personal opinion, the books is to close to being real I had nightmares.... I like a little more fantasy in my read. However that is my personal opinion. The book is very well written you will not become bored when reading. You will be pulled into this book with an extreme mixture of emotions.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Home to a litany of hit singles well-respected signature songs (and live staples), Van Halen's excellent eponymous debut captures the band as their peak. And while even though \\"Runnin' With The Devil,\\" \\"You Really Got Me,\\" \\"Jamie's Cryin',\\" \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love,\\" and \\"Ice Cream Man\\" might have gotten the most radio play, it would not be at all a stretch to say that darn near every song on this 1978 recording is a hit. If nothing else, then there should at least be no debate as to whether or not \\"Van Halen\\" is filled with great guitar licks, infectious hooks, and ridiculously dazzling, vertigo-inducing solos.<br /><br />\\"Eruption,\\" might be just a short little interlude track that clocks in only at just over 100 seconds in length, but it still takes the cake for being the \\"Van Halen\\"'s highpoint. It is an instrumental piece comprised of some truly epic, positively insane, blistering, and very wailing guitar shredding/soloing. But as already noted, there is absolutely no shortage of standout tracks, here. \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" is a confidently rocking opening anthem; and \\"You Really Got Me\\" is a Kinks cover that boasts irresistible hooks, grumbling bass, memorable vocals/lyrics, and some more wailing solo flights. Later cuts like \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" and \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" are both insanely catchy, and sing-along worthy. (And the latter of these two songs also boasts another memorably pyrotechnic and screaming guitar soloing.)<br /><br />Some of the album's other best songs include the catchy, chanted vocal refrain (\\"Hey, hey, hey!\\") that rocks really hard in \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\"; the amusingly goofy (or at the very least comical) \\"Ice Cream Man\\" (which finds frontman David Lee Roth pulling out and adding \\"acoustic guitar\\" to his resume); and the wailing falsetto vocal hooks in \\"On Fire.\\" With that said, though, if there is one track that comes closest to dethroning the above-described \\"Eruption,\\" it is actually \\"I'm The One.\\" It finds the band taking a surprisingly blistering, and nearly frenzied approach, and is also highlighted by another memorable vocal pattern, and plenty more steep, wailing, and totally air-guitar-able shredding.<br /><br />Not only is this the sound of a band at their peak, and an arresting, whopper of a debut, it is also easily one of the most popular heavy metal recordings of all time. It did, in fact, peak at #19 on the Billboard chart, and go on to shift over ten million units in the U.S.A. alone. As a result, \\"Van Halen\\" is the best hard rock/heavy metal album of 1978, and easily one of the genre's finest of the Seventies. It ought to be a mandatory purchase for anybody that loves music.surprisingly blistering, and nearly frenzied approach, and is also highlighted by another memorable vocal pattern, and plenty more steep, wailing, and totally air-guitar-able shredding.<br /><br />Not only is this the sound of a band at their peak, and an arresting, whopper of a debut, it is also easily one of the most popular heavy metal recordings of all time.

B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I really liked this movie, so much so that I watched it twice in a row, and I never do that.  Will Smith has created a majestic Saturnian character, and his son is delightful as Kitai.  There is a lot of heart in the film, from the family relationship back home to the eagle family in the Old World of Earth.  It was just fun!  I just ordered it again to watch it a third time.  It's a keeper.

B00D2ZF24O|2.0|I heard that this movie was bad but I couldn't believe that Will Smith would be an actor in a bad film. Man was I wrong. This film had the worst acting that I have ever seen in film and Will Smith played an emotionless person with the personality of a rock. To be honest I don't blame Will Smith or his son I blame the Director and Co-Author M Night Shyamalan for this film. Will Smith's acting talent was wasted in this film.<br /><br />I struggle to give it 2 stars. Frankly it was slow moving and boring a lot of the time. The actors all appeared to be stiff in playing their roles and the film was not good. Don't waste your money on buying the DVD. Rent it, watch it and then forget about it. The film has no replay value at all.

B00DU74U74|2.0|Glad I did because I'll never watch again. It's cold and harsh and the interplay between Wanda and Melanie falls flat. They also changed everything, even minor details!! Tiny spoiler alert....... for example..... Melanie's dad commits suicide rather than give the kids up but that isn't true in the book and it doesn't improve the story by changing it. When you change things between a book and a movie you should be able to validate those changes. They need to help the viewer form an attachment to the characters or something. (Think the mockingjay pin in The Hunger Games for example. That allowed the viewer to feel for the relationship between Prim and Katniss and foreshadow Katniss' attachment to Rue. But this movie shows none of that complexity of thought.) And it goes on like that. Every tiny detail is different. It's as if they wrote a totally new story based on the alien idea. I could go on for days with all the differences.... I think the only thing the same is that it's based on an alien invasion. I gave it two stars only because I've seen worse but I was being generous. Rent before you buy.... my opinion is I'd rather have my $3.99 rental fee back. Total waste of money.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book gives us an insight on something most block out. It talks about life and not just life but real life. Most don't think about how death would be until your faced with it than it crashes down on us. This book shows that dying isn't the end of the world, that you can still live while dying. It's a book I think everyone should read once, because it shares and gives us a little look into reality without having to be cursed with it. I recommend you read it. That's my review.

0316204366|2.0|Let me begin by saying that \\"David and Goliath\\" is an easy read.  If you are a fast reader with extra time on your hands, you can finish the entire book in one sitting.  Gladwell is a good, entertaining writer.  Having said that, I was disappointed with the content of his book.  Thus, this review will focus on those points.<br /><br />\\"David and Goliath\\" is about battling giants... at least, I'm sure that's what you thought when you bought the book.  That's certainly what the subtitle states - \\"Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battle Giants.\\"  However, you would only be partially correct.  While there is some content related to battling so-called giants, the book's title is misleading.  Most of the book is about advantages and disadvantages.  The first section is about perceived advantages and how these advantages are often the source of disadvantage.  The middle section is about perceived disadvantages and how these can be advantages.  The last few chapters are about the limits of power, which is poorly connected to the overall theme of the book.  Most of the stories had very little to do with battling giants, regardless of how you define the term \\"giants\\".  In fact, Gladwell uses a very loose definition of \\"giants\\".  Giants are anything that seems formidable.<br /><br />Introduction:  Goliath<br />Gladwell begins strong.  He presents the story of David and Goliath but provides background to the story.  The message to take away from the story is that David surprised Goliath.  Goliath was expecting a sword-to-sword battle.  Instead, David came out with his sling and took out the giant by refusing the play to Goliath's strengths, namely, his size.  But Gladwell also mentions that what is perceived as Goliath's strength is also a source of weakness; Goliath likely had acromegaly (assuming the story is even historical).  Acromegaly limited Goliath's vision requiring him to fight in close quarters; David would not fight Goliath on equal terms.  In the end, David slays Goliath.  Not a bad start to the book.<br /><br />Chapter 1:<br />In this chapter, Gladwell presents the case of Vivek Ranadive, who was able to lead a team of basketball underdogs to the championship without any formal knowledge of the game.  Moreover, Ranadive's players barely knew the rules when they began training.  However, by focusing on physical conditioning and the lesser employed tactic of full-court press, Ranadive was able to wear down opposing teams and increase opportunities to steal the ball.  This is clearly a story about the triumph of the underdog, and it is in-line with the title.  Unfortunately, the Introduction and Chapter 1 are the best sections of the book.  It goes downhill from this point.<br /><br />Chapter 2:<br />Here, Gladwell focuses on school classroom size and how a perceived advantage - i.e. small class size - is actually a disadvantage.  While a smaller class size may improve learning, there is a point where a very low class size can actually hurt student performance.  While this topic is interesting in itself, it is only loosely connected to the notion of battling giants.  In fact, the connection is an artificial one; I'm not even sure who or what the \\"giant\\" is supposed to be in this story.  Is it the educational system?  Is it student performance?  Is it class size?<br /><br />Gladwell's point is that advantages can be a source of disadvantage.  However, he doesn't really tell you how to battle the so-called giant, whatever the giant is supposed to be in this story.  If the giant is classroom size, then it would've been nice to state what the ideal classroom size would be for elementary or middle school or high school students.  Instead, all you know is that class size shouldn't be too low, whatever \\"too low\\" means.  But if we take his point to the logical extreme, he seems to imply that one-on-one tutoring may not have advantages.  After all, that is the ultimate small class room.  However, this has neither been my experience nor the experience of most parents who can afford private, one-on-one lessons for their children, whether in an athletics or academics.  In fact, studies on expertise by K Anders Ericsson, whom Gladwell mentions in \\"Blink\\", states that individual mentoring or coaching is very important for achieving high levels of success.<br /><br />Chapter 3:<br />Chapter 3 suffers similar problems with chapter 2.  It is the story of Caroline Sacks.  She was a high academic achiever in high school, but discovered that she was not good enough to compete in the Ivy Leagues.  She loved science and wanted to pursue a career in a scientific field; however, she could not compete with the other students at Brown University.  Gladwell's point is that she has a perceived advantage over most students - she had the ability to get admitted into Brown University.  Nonetheless, this advantage became a source of disadvantage for her.  She ultimately felt defeated by becoming a small fish in a big pond, and eventually chose not to pursue her love of science.  Had she gone to a second-choice school, she might've been a high achiever and more successful.  In short, it's sometimes better to be a big fish in a small pond, rather than always seeking to enter the big pond and finding out that you're only a little fish.<br /><br />Once again, I'm not sure who or what the giant is in this story.  If the giant is the Ivy League school, Brown University, then Gladwell is not really discussing how to successfully battle this giant.  Gladwell's message is to choose another opponent to do battle with - i.e. choose a non-Ivy League school.  In this case, the giant has defeated the underdog by getting the underdog to choose an easier opponent to fight.  Isn't this the antithesis of the books' theme?<br /><br />Chapter 4:<br />Beginning with chapter 4, the book takes a different turn.  Gladwell begins focusing on disadvantages, suggesting that they can be a source of advantage.  This is not a novel idea, but Gladwell stretches this idea to make his case.  In this chapter he mentions that dyslexia is a perceived disadvantage but is a characteristic of nearly one-third of entrepreneurs, including Richard Branson, Charles Schwab, David Neeleman, and others.  In other words, approximately 30% of entrepreneurs have dyslexia and may have become successful businessmen because of their dyslexia.  Of course, the other possibility is that these entrepreneurs succeeded in spite of their dyslexia, rather than because of it.  This point is merely dismissed by Gladwell without much consideration.<br /><br />Nonetheless, anyone who has taken a basic statistics or critical thinking class should immediately see a flaw with Gladwell's reasoning.  He seems to want his reader's to think that if a person is dyslexic then he/she has a 30% chance of becoming incredibly successful in business.  But stating that 30% of entrepreneurs have dyslexia is not the same as saying that 30% of dyslexics are entrepreneurs.  Moreover, if 30% of entrepreneurs have dyslexia, then that means 70% of entrepreneurs do not, and from empirical evidence, dyslexics struggle in academic fields throughout much of their life.  Let's not forget that an overwhelming majority of jobs expect employees to be college educated, at least.  There are also a large number of dyslexics in prison.  Thus, while having dyslexia can be an advantage (if Gladwell is correct), it is not an advantage for most.  Yet Gladwell seems to insinuate that dyslexia is not a problem at all; he just stops short of suggesting that dyslexia is something you might wish for your children and grandchildren because of the advantages it can provide.  I guess that's why I'm not a multi-billionaire; I don't have dyslexia.<br /><br />Gladwell goes on to present the story of two dyslexics, David Boies and Gary Cohn.  Boies became a successful trial lawyer and Cohn became president of Goldman Sachs.  Both were successful because they were forced to compensate for their dyslexia.  They had to develop other skills that they learned to use to their benefit.  So if dyslexia is a \\"giant\\", then the way to battle this giant is to compensate for it, rather than overcome it.  In other words, the dyslexic isn't defeating his or her problem but circumventing the problem.  In the end, I felt these stories were stretching the theme of the book.<br /><br />The following quote from Gladwell summarizes this chapter: \\"Most people with a serious disability cannot master all those steps [i.e. steps to compensate for a disability].  But those who can are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is inevitably more powerful than the learning that comes easily.\\"  That is, if you have a disability, you are not likely to be able to compensate for it; however, if you are one of the lucky ones who manage to compensate, then you have a good chance to be successful.  This isn't really encouraging or instructive.  It isn't even insightful.<br /><br />Chapter 5:<br />The message of chapter 5 can be summed up in Nietzsche's famous quote, \\"What does not kill me, makes me stronger.\\"  But the chapter is longwinded and holds a superficial, even artificially created, relationship to the idea of battling giants.  In this chapter, Gladwell points out that we are often afraid of fear, but the actual experience that we are afraid of is less frightening once it is experienced.  But once again, as with chapter 4, the message of this chapter is not instructive or insightful.<br /><br />Chapter 5 does provide one explanation for how heroes are created.  Many so-called heroes and successful individuals have experienced death early in their lives - i.e. the death of at least one parent.  As a result, they are often \\"disagreeable\\" individuals; that is, they go against the societal grain.  They often take much abuse from the mainstream, but if these individuals can weather the storm, then they are often stronger in the end.  Of course, a lot of prisoners have also lost at least one parent at a young age.  So if you are looking for a way to think of this information in your own battles with \\"giants\\", you will have learned nothing by the end of the chapter.  The take home message: hardship can be an advantage.  This is true, but once again, Gladwell's message is not insightful.<br /><br />Chapter 6:<br />This chapter is about the 1960s Civil Rights era.  Gladwell reiterates the same theme from chapter 5 - i.e. what doesn't kill you, will make you stronger.  But he also discusses some the questionable tactics that the Civil Rights activists used to win their political and legal freedoms.  For example, Wyatt Walker's approach was to \\"use what we got\\" and win by \\"any means necessary\\".  In fact, Martin Luther King Jr and Wyatt Walker used children to stir public attention for their cause, even allowing them to be jailed or beaten or nearly killed.  Aside from the ethical issue of this tactic, Gladwell's message is to do whatever it takes when fighting a giant.  But how far is this supposed to go?  Would Gladwell condone similar attitudes and behaviors exhibited by paramilitary or terrorist groups?  Isn't that basically what these groups think they are doing as well - doing whatever is necessary for their \\"rightful\\" cause?  In the end, this chapter fits with the basic theme of battling giants, but raises other questions.<br /><br />Chapter 7-9:<br />The last three chapters are about the limits of power.  I'm not sure how these chapters fit into the overall theme of the book.  The stories seem unconnected to the first two sections of the book, which focuses on advantages and disadvantages.  While the chapters touch loosely upon the theme, the overall content is primarily a divergence from the theme.  I felt that these chapters were added as fillers, rather than pertinent or important topics.<br /><br />In fact, Gladwell spends a great deal of time talking about the legitimacy versus illegitimacyof power.  After defining the differences, his point is that illegitimate power will not prevail in the end, and illegitimate power often leads to counterproductive results.  In other words, there are limits to what you can expect from the use of power or force.  However, the stories he shares to make his point seem disconnected to the rest of the book.<br /><br />In short, \\"David and Goliath\\" is Gladwell's worst book.  The only saving grace is his writing ability.  In fact, the best chapter is the Introduction.  Unfortunately, I felt that the book was less about battling giants and more a hodge-podge of diverse stories centered around a concocted theme in order for Gladwell to sell another book.  There is nothing newsworthy, instructive, or insightful in its pages.  Thus, I give this book two stars.eir dyslexia.  They had to develop other skills that they learned to use to their benefit.

B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Amazon had better start getting their shit together about their pricing before they lose a LOT of business.<br />Amazon was asking $3.99 to rent this movie - I rented it from Redbox for $1.25.<br />Amazons incredibly bad business practice aside - this was a pretty good sci-fi adventure. ( FOR $1.25 - not $3.99)<br />Yes, Will smiths kid is a pretty bad actor. Despite his bad acting it was still a pretty good watch. Contrived, certainly, as most movies are, but however bad the acting was the special effects were very good. I enjoyed this movie mostly for the CG graphics more than anything else, BUT, without Will and his kid it wouldn't have been a movie at all.<br />I really like Will Smith as an actor. I wish I could say the same for his kid, but he's just a kid. He might grow into the acting genre yet after a few more years.<br />Overall I was happy with my $1.25 purchase.<br />I would have been UNHAPPY with a $3.99 purchase however. AMAZON  ! ! ! !

Even with it being two hours long it seemed shallow and to not really get into the story as much as earlier movie adaptations. Really had high hopes for this movie but was sadly disappointed.

1400052181|2.0|As others have mentioned, the book starts off promisingly, but the last half seems to be a pointless exploration of just another poor, uneducated dysfunctional family, wanting to sue somebody to get rich quick. This book doesn't do the Lacks family credit at all. It actually seemed to be a form of &#34;damning with faint praise.&#34; I'm afraid I didn't feel a great sense of outrage about the doctors &#34;taking her cells&#34; as I didn't think it was terribly wrong (and I suspected that the family members who kept talking about &#34;our mother cells&#34; may have had no idea what a cell actually is). What's more, I have the feeling that if Henrietta Lacks had been asked if they could use her cancer cells, she would've said yes. On the other hand, judging from the superstitious and fearful way her family reacted, maybe it's just as well she wasn't asked! After all, it was a tumor growing on her cervix, for crying out loud, not a part of her body she would need or want. Tumors get biopsied all the time, specimens sent for lab analysis. Using them for cell cultures instead is no victimization. It did not cause her any more suffering than she was already having and required no sacrifice on her part, so I see no parallel with the horrible Tuskegee experiments. Her family not knowing about it was ironic, but now that they do know, they have been exposed to a major invasion of privacy. We can ask, is the Lacks family better off or worse now? The author is the exploiter, not &#34;John Hopkin.&#34;

B00FSBW2L6|5.0|An epic masterpiece, Black Eagle Inn, by the very talented Christoph Fischer has concluded his brilliant trilogy with this his best yet. From the gripping first traumatic pages through to the surprising end this read does not disappoint. The characters are compelling and we can't help falling in love with Maria and her family, flawed and imperfect as they all are, they are who we are, who we love, who we struggle with in our daily lives, who support us and help us have a sense of worth, they are the best and worst of the human condition expressed through gripping dialogues and historical scenes. Black Eagle Inn burns its image into the heart and mind of the reader, and lingers on for days after the last page is closed.Highly recommend and will definitely read again.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|Christopher Clark has written a well researched account of the period from 1887 to the beginning of World War I.  While there are many other accounts of what happened between June 28, 1914 and August 1, 1914 Mr. Clark deals with the polarization of Europe that lead to World War I.  He does not meed out blame to anyone nation or leader, but goes into great detail on how each of the major powers reached the decision to go to war.  This book is not for the weekend history buff, and the decision to read it should not be taken lightly.  it is not a page turner, but is a book that will take time and dedication to read.  I would recommend it to any one that desires a more complete understanding of how Europe became embroiled in World War I.

While out walking on the Saturday morning (having begun the experiment at 6pm on Friday night) I passed under several cherry blossom trees in full bloom.  Never before have I seen so many honey bees in one spot that the trees were literally humming!  I haven't seen many honey bees since either.<br /><br />Pam's got a great sense of humour that comes through and makes the book really easy to read and want to try the different experiments.  I absolutely recommend this book.

0446573027|4.0|I was so disappointed in The Sixth Man, that I was almost sorry I bought this book. However, I think Puller is a much more interesting character. That being said, the book starts out like a captivating novel, but loses momentum as the story develops. I get the feeling Baldacci makes his plots so terribly involved that he has trouble keeping up with the developing storyline. Instead of getting more and more exciting as it progresses, his characters become rather boring toward the end like he has trouble tying up all the loose ends.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Movie was full of interesting sub plots, well woven at the end.<br />Young Kirk is a bit mutch, but guess it's his youth.<br /><br />The only problem is they defy to existing story line,<br />having Kahn appear so early, it means the entire story<br />line lacks validity.<br /><br />A different quantum universe.<br /><br />Gut you plays Spoke was great, same as Uhura.  Carol Marcus, wasn't she an old flame<br />of Kirk?<br /><br />Sort of lacked a real ending.  probably should have given 4 but it so nice to see a good attmpt<br />at keeping star trek alive.<br /><br />What they need is a new series, in another time period, perhaps the next, next generation.

B008JFUNNM|4.0|Film inspired by true events are a dime and a dozen; but every now and again, we have a movie that does a swell job at bringing the true story to the silver screen. The latest film to bring reality to the limelight is Captain Phillips: the story of the hostage situation of the Maersk Alabama in 2009. This adaption was courtesy of  the book A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea , which was written by Capt. Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty. With a star like Tom Hanks and director Paul Greengrass, Captain Phillips has been shaping itself into quite the movie; and now it has the reviews to back it up. Yet, is this thriller worthy of the true events and your time?    As already stated, the movie follows the events of the hostage situation of the Maersk Alabama. The situation saw Captain Phillips and his crew dealing with Somalian Pirates only for the captain to be capture and the US Navy to get involved. Now imagine the tension and drama that made this situation and turn it into an action flick.    Captain Phillips' story is one that is easy to get into. While I felt the first act was quickly paced, once the Maersk Alabama gets chased by the Pirates, the plot straighten itself out. The story plays out by looking at two perspective: Captain Phillip and Muse. While this element does not last long, it gave the film a form of depth and I think it helped in the long run. Nevertheless, Captain Phillips has a story tension that will have anyone interested.    I can't say Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life as Captain Phillips; but it certainly one his best in a while. If anything the role is one of Tom Hanks' more physical ones. I was curious to see how Barkhad Abdi would fair as Muse. While his performance wasn't as impressive as I was hoping, it was still solid. The rest of the cast is their to be supporting, and nothing more. That might sound discrediting; but on the contrary, the cast still worked.    The cinematography was a hita miss for me. On one hand, I like the overall imagery. Unfortunately, I found that  the cinematography to be very distracting. The camera move so much that it became an eyesore for me. Granted, I understand why the camera was moving, but it was still obnoxious. Fortunately, what wasn't straining was the tension, and boy is this movie was exciting. From the chase of the Marersk Alabama to the film's climax, Captain Phillips is certain to have you on the edge of your seat.    The one scene that stood  out to me was the chase of the Maresk Alabama. In fact the whole sequence of the Alabama vs Pirates was great. The scene was riddled with tension and didn't play like your average action film. I would also give props to the film's climax, but you know what is going to happening in that, so it wasn't as gripping. Still, the sequence is tense.    Captain Phillips is a film worthy of its subject matter. While the cinematography can be difficult to deal with, the film is still gripping and has terrific performance from Tom Hanks. I can't say how close it is to the true story; but Captain Phillips makes for one exiting time at the movies.    Also read the review here: [...]

B000002UYZ|5.0|Once you say the Beatles, is it really necessary to say anything more. All their work is beyond excellent in my opinion and this CD won't let you down. It has their earlier songs and the quality of the unremastered version is typical of the time period. Whatever version you hear the Beatles will always be the greatest!

I cried at the sad parts, laughed at the funny part, and cheered at the ending. overall it was an amazing end to the series and i would absolutly would recomend it. Long Live Harry Potter!!

B008YBOGVG|5.0|Although I had this on CD from when it was originally released many years ago, it is one of those &#34;special&#34; CD's by an artist that I truly love. Like Billie Holiday - Marianne Faithfull has a unique voice that is well suited to the material. A perfect combination of artist paired with the right material. So I sprung for this DELUXE remaster.<br /><br />First - the original CD mix is astounding. The remastering is definitely as &#34;step up&#34; from the original release, and brings out the details of the music and Marianne's voice. BUT the original / unreleased mix is definitely a PLUS and one reason to buy this CD. A variation that is definitely worth the listen and reason to make the purchase. Not sure yet, which I prefer - but both are worth the listen.<br /><br />And then the additional bonus tracks are the second reason to grab up this CD.<br /><br />All in All it's a great CD and worth every penny. I have not purchased the vinyl as not sure how well that is remastered but will definitely explore for feedback on that.
0770437400|5.0|bought it as a gift for a friend<br />he says it quite good. worth reading<br />i have watched the movie
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Yeah, it isn't Cher at her best. I personally love Cher when she's doing Rock and POP in the manner of STARS or not.com.mercial. Not a big of fan of the vocal arrangements of the first few songs where we get more &#34;tech vocals&#34; than Cher vocals ... but it's still worth the purchase. And the latter half of the CD is definitely better for me than those first few songs.<br /><br />But I can still dance to it and enjoy the music and know that watching her perform these will be amazing. She definitely gives it her all when she's on that stage. And I'm sure the crowd will want to hear the first of the songs on the CD. Hey, I go to her concerts to be entertained and she definitely delivers. And it's these kind of songs that she does llive that get the crown ramped up and in a party mood. I really don't necessarily want to hear her sing STARS on stage.<br /><br />I know I sound a bit schizo on this one - but anything Cher does is fine by me. Some things I like better for listening when I'm sitting and nursing a glass of wine. But when I'm working - this CD is a definite part of my playlist - the energy keeps me motivated and &#34;up&#34;.<br /><br />So I say &#34;go for it&#34;. It may not be her &#34;perfect&#34; CD. But damn, there are those that are &#34;perfect&#34; ... but that shouldn't stop you from adding this to your collection. Turn it on, Turn it up and DANCE.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|I love the real genuine practicality, inspirational anyone-can-do-it-ness of Mark's book. He's never bring, always right, insightful and gets to the point. A no b.s. approach to biz and life.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am in awe of the mind and talent of Victor Hugo on many levels. His knowledge of French history and culture of the late  18th century and first half of the 19th is immense, and other European cultures, as well. The pictures he paints for us delicious, though not to everyone's taste, I'm sure. The description of Napolean's armies in battle were a bit much for me, but his narration are impeccable, particularly descriptive of Paris in that period of history. (Hugo' s novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, was fascinating for the images of Paris, as well). These descriptions were interspersed very artfully with the main theme of the book, the life and times of Jean Valjean, the larger than life love for his \\"daughter\\",Cosette, and the love story between Cosette and Markus. Long and involved (much more than any of the movie remakes I've seen) I enjoyed it completely!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It's great to finally be past the television series, and this book does not disappoint. Can't wait to start the next one.
B00B2166BS|1.0|I am not happy with this as it was defective.  Nexus 10 tablet will not charge when connected using this cable.  For $25.00 I would have expected more.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|First let me say this, it's not science fiction flick, at least not in the traditional sense.  It's a drama & a story within a story.<br /><br />The film is phenomenally written & the story grabs hold & doesn't let go until the end.  It has been a very long time since a movie this authentic in portrayal as well as acting has graced the big screen.<br /><br />If you have the option, spend the extra money & go the IMAX 3D route, you will not be dissapointed in anyway.<br /><br />I am a space enthusiast, so even though some of the plot points are inaccurate, it is only minor stuff & doesn't take away from the film in anyway. The minor inaccuracies had to be done to make the film & story work. Unless your a NASA nut you won't even notice it & even then the film is so compelling & nonstop action packed (literally from start to finish)  you really don't have time to think about it.<br /><br />With that said, this film screams authenticity in every other sense.<br /><br />I have always loved Sandra Bullock films, she has the natural ability to literally become the person she is portraying. Sandy's performance in this film is undoubtedly one of her best & no one else could have pulled it off as effortlessly as she made this look. Sandy's acting made this film believable, you have a hard time remembering this isn't really happening.<br /><br />I will be completely shocked & dismayed if she doesn't win an Oscar for her role. Yes, she really is that good.<br /><br />This is just my opinion, but what makes Sandy so perfect for this role is her approachability. She is one of the very few celebrities that lives & acts like a normal person. She is so genuine & down to Earth. She doesn't act like a celebrity at all, she very much acts like an ordinary everyday person like the rest of us. She's a true star in every sense of the word & makes millions for her roles, but you would never know it from her personality.  This is why she is so successful in her career & why everyone adoresher & the characters she portrays.<br /><br />Gravity is a nonstop action packed, scary, emotion filled joyride, that only stops once the film is over. The story is very relatable to everyone, as it focuses on the tragedies, obstacles & hardships we all face everyday.<br /><br />Go see this film, tell everyone you know to go see this film. In all honesty this film is very realistic & even some actual astronauts have said it portrays the overwhelming fear they all face when performing real missions.<br /><br />This may sound crazy but those who have seen the film know what I mean & how true it is, after leaving the theater you will be changed, you will feel emotionally connected & you'll never look at your life the same way again. All of which is most certainly not a bad thing.<br /><br />5 stars, A+, highly recommended & an absolute no regret purchase. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IN ANYTHING BUT IMAX 3D!!! if you don't have access to IMAX theater, then definitely opt for the 3D version. Yes, 3D is more expensive ($13.00) & IMAX 3D even more so ($17.00) but it's more than well worth the money. If you choose to go cheap you will regret not spending the extra $ to see it. Honestly, $17.00 is a lot for a movie, but after the movie is over, you will feel as though you couldn't have enjoyed & experienced it any other way & will not have the slightest regret.<br /><br />Hopefully Hollywood is watching & taking notes, we need more films like this. This was a very refreshing change to all the box office flops that plagued the summer. (With the exception of Iron Man 3, another outstanding film).

B00000ITOY|5.0|I have one year old twins and they have loved this toy for a couple of months now, paired with two empty Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes tub. They love pushing the wooden pieces into the tub and then having me open it so they can dump out the pieces. It's very good for improving their hand coordination and dexterity. I didn't give them the peg board because they are too young for it, they might poke themselves in the eye with one of the sticks or hit each other with the peg board. Also they push the shapes into the Kid O Sort-A-Shape House. Sometimes they just carry one of the wooden pieces around and chew it. Another thing you can do is connect them with links (Sassy Ring O' Links Rattle Developmental Toy).

B007HXL1V0|5.0|Sound advice from a couple of experts...no guarantees their empathetic listening techniques will work, but its better than what we're doing now.  The cartoons matched conversations in our house.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Bought the less expensive version before and was mistakes-- FM transmitter is not a reliable solution (a lot of noise). BUT this device is great because the screen tells the song name AND hooking it into the phono of the car stereo gives great quality. The only thing I wish was different is whenever the car turns off and then on again, it resets to the beginning of the song rather than where it left off...
B008RZF2I0|5.0|Kamelot does it again! With every album, comes something better. With Tommy Karevik on vocals, the band sounds better than ever. This also has guest vocals from Elize Ryd of Amaranthe and \\"the blue banshee\\" Alissa White Gluz of The Agonist. This is one I highly recommend for any metal fan.
1250030951|5.0|Before you start reading this it contains fan fiction in it ( little stories based on a series of books within the story). The Simon and Baz books reminded me of Harry Potter because the main character, Simon, had magical powers and his friends acted like Hermione and Ron.<br /><br />I absolutely love it! Initially I liked Wren more than Cath because Wren was more outgoing and wasn't afraid to meet other people and go and party. Cath just seemed so boring during her Fall semester in college and she would rather write fan fiction than go out and hang with people her own age. I did not like how Cath was shy and the total opposite of Wren and how Cath would get annoyed with anyone who made fun of the Simon and Baz books. Cath seemed way too protective of her sister and I did not like how Levi (roomates friend) would ask her to hang out and she would just deny him and instead work all alone in her dorm room. Levi seemed so happy to be around Cath and wasn't freaked out about her obsession with fan fiction. Levi and Cath make an awesome couple.<br /><br />In the beginning when Cath had just settled into her dorm I thought she was an idiot for not asking people how the cafeteria worked and instead eating a bunch of granola bars in her room. Cath is in a Fiction writing class and she becomes friends with an upperclassman named Nick and I almost thought that she was falling in love with him. They would hang out in the basement of the the library and work on writing a story together. At some point in this book Levi told Cath about how people can exploit others and I thought he was talking about their relationship but it wasn't. Cath is later betrayed (sort of) by someone in one of her classes and she just lets them walk all over her. That's another example of how Cath isn't the smartest person ever.<br /><br />Now onto Wren. I liked Wren because she wasn't so obsessive about Simon and Baz (she and Cath both worked on writing fan fiction about Simon and Baz). Wren was more ofa free spirit and did whatever she wanted without being so afraid of everybody like Cath was. However, I do wish that Wren cared more about her father than the parties that were going on at campus and that she should have left to take care of her father when he was having one of his meltdowns ( read this book and you will understand); I can tell you that the meltdowns have to do with Wren and Cath's mother leaving.<br /><br />I really like the ending of this book.<br /><br />more reviews at: [...]

B0014BY72Q|3.0|This movie's visual effects and sound might look now (2013) totally outdated but the story is nice. I recommend it for those people who intend to watch classic science fiction movies that are simple to understand. I like complicated and twisted science fiction movies that is why I gave it 3 stars.

B005LAIIN0|4.0|First, I enjoyed the movie and was entertained, which is what a movie is suppose to do.  It kind of reminded me of Contagion with the disease being zombies.  The best parts of the movie are how the world falls apart when faced with a world-wide disease.  Kind of makes you want to go out and buy an AR-15 and start stockpiling food...<br /><br />I missed the movie in the theater and the Bluray version was great.  I always like the Bonus Features which show how they managed to pull off all the scenes.  Definitely worth the money.

B003VANOFY|3.0|First, let me say that the design and craftsmanship of this headset are top notch. The unit feels very sturdy, and definitely has that \\"expensive\\" feel to it. The ear cups fit completely around your ears, so there is no ache from extended use. The foam used on the ear cups and headbar padding both feel very luxurious and do not hold heat too badly. The audio quality and stereo/surround separation are both superb, the microphone isn't /amazing/ but it does its job stupendously. The LED \\"mute\\" indicator at the end of the boom has proven to be very useful aslo. The battery life is amazing; ten hours of use from a four hour charge is more than I could have ever wanted. The three G-Keys are very handy, as is the volume wheel. Overall, a very solid headset in both aesthetics and function.<br /><br />I gave this headset three stars for two reasons... Firstly, its interference problems are HORRENDOUS. The headset's wireless receiver runs on the same frequency and channels as household wireless networks, so it sporadically disconnects causing a very frequent and aggravating lapse in audio. This interference can also cause other wireless devices to lose signal; I would sometimes have absolutely no wireless connectivity to anything else when the headset was on. THIS IS FIXABLE if you are able to change what channel your WiFi network operates on. I have found that channel 1 or 11 (the first and last available) work best. If they included the ability to use the USB cable for audio instead of just charging I would definitely buy the updated model. (But they wouldn't make money selling replacement receivers like they do now, would they?)<br /><br />The second reason is that now, after eight months of light to moderate use, the battery is completely shot and will not hold any charge whatsoever. They sell replacement batteries fairly cheap ($12 on Amazon, priced similarly on Logitech's website) but the fact that I have to do this after only eight freaking months is bonkers.<br /><br/>These problems aside, I love this headset and do not regret buying it one bit.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Where do I begin with this release?  How about this:  I'm not really sure why people are calling this AB's \\"heaviest\\" release.  I'm not sure about that.  Does it have heavy songs on it?  Sure, but I don't think it's any heavier than AB III.  Maybe it's just me.<br /><br />Simply put, every song on this CD is good.  If there is one song I probably skip through most it's Bleed It Dry only because I find it a little too repetitive.  Otherwise, I don't skip around on this one.  I play it through and stop to re-listen to my favorite tracks.  So, I'll just highlight the ones I really really like.  Before I do, let me just encourage you to buy the whole album.  I'm NOT simply suggesting you buy just these songs.<br /><br />Waters Rising -  My favorite track.  Heavy.  Great, varying harmonies.  Tremonti actually sings the lead on this and his voice is clean and heavy.<br /><br />The Uninvited -  Like Waters Rising, really well-written and catchy.<br /><br />Farther Than The Sun -  A great hard rock song.  Just like all the AB songs you like, it's a nice one to sing along to.<br /><br />Fortress -  All title tracks should be killer.  A lot of them are.  This one is.  It's a deep and ranging song.  Everything you love about AB is in this tune.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This show is so amazing. Way better than any of those awful movies they put out these days. I hope they can keep up the greatness with Season 3.

1476727651|4.0|Another excellent Stephen King novel, thrilling all the way through, recommended for horror fans and those who list similar genre
B004FECNIO|5.0|It's a good movie about a young boys struggle to understand his place in life. Think of it as an adored child's struggles with trying to fit in to a new family, in to life.  Looking for that something we all need and want.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Anyone reading this already knows what the film is about and has heard a myriad number of opinions on this and that, so I will focus upon only the actual quality of the film's transfer to Blu Ray and my rating is based upon that and not the movie itself.  That said, I like the film though it can be slow at times, and the acting is spot on great.<br /><br />VIDEO.....<br />  The video transfer to Blu Ray doesn't get much better than this.  There was no artifacting of any kind nor aliasing when in certain scenes both aliasing and stair stepping could have visually presented themselves.  Color grading is fairly warm in appearance but very naturally so.  Post production editors did not overly boost colors nor crush the blacks so your image is very lifelike in all scenes.  No bleach bypassing either which has grown to be found in more and more films these days.  You have to look hard to find the barest hint of grain and then it would be on walls in the background. Contrast is perfect, not too sharp nor soft and details in most dark scenes are readily identifiable  Mbps rates seemed to average in the high 20s to low 30's depending upon the action in the film.  5 Stars for the video transfer.<br /><br />AUDIO.....<br />  I read elsewhere another reviewer's thoughts on the audio.  He thought it was great.  I was very disappointed in the audio transfer of this film.  Much of a reviewer's credibility lies in how they see a film i.e. what monitor were they watching, what speakers were they listening through, did they have a stereo system or a 5.1 or 7.1 home theater setup, what is the quality of their amps, preamp and processor, Blu Ray player and speakers and subwoofer. I have a very high end, esoteric home theater and the audio of a film is just as important to me as the video.  So I am okay with another person's contrary opinions to mine.  For the film Flight, you are presented with a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio and the lossless audio will always be better than a lossy one.  However, while most of this film is dialogue driven there are plenty of opportunities for foley audio fx for the surrounds but the audio editors failed to take advantage of them.  Almost all the film is presented in the front stage with very rare use of the rear stage.  This might be okay for some but the big jet crash scene should have made you feel as if you were in the jet itself as it was going down.  While the LFE channel got a great workout for  this scene, almost all the audio was widely placed across the front sound stage with very little discreet directionality of that audio.  It sounded as if the front left, center and front right channels were all getting the same info.<br />  Despite the lossless codec, this film's dialogue audio levels sounded too low for me, not because of background soundtracks or foley fx, its just that while most times the dialogue could be transparently clear, at many times it almost went to a whisper.  An example is when Denzel's character is listening to a phone message.  Yes, the message should have a different audio tonality but it should be loud enough to clearly understand.  It not always was in both this scene and several others.  I sadyl give the audio a 3 star rating at best.<br /><br />EXTRAS...<br />  Do you call 3 advertisement previews for other films extras?  I don't.  They force you to pay for advertising, which is what these previews are, and take up more disc space instead of leaving room for even less compression of the feature film.  I really hate having to pay for previews.<br />  Other extras include a typical 'Making of', production origins, a panel discussion about the film which I haven't watched yet and a short doc on the crash itself.  There are no out takes or deleted scenes.<br />  Also included is the Standard Def version on disc which is always handy and, IMHO, a worthless Ultraviolet serial number for downloading the film.  I have never talked to anyone who likes Ultraviolet.  Having the SD DVD isenough.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray and the disc itself and I do hope that this review has been of some help to your in deciding upon your purchase.<br />Thanks for reading.enough.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray and the disc itself and I do hope that this review has been of some help to your in deciding upon your purchase.<br />Thanks for reading.

B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|I was so emotional last night while listening the songs and the lyrics, Carlos Vives make me go back in time with my first love, my home and my father.

0345803450|3.0|The book deals with a clear picture of the end of the Cold War - or near it - because it went on into the early '80's. The suspicions, the mistrusts as seen through the eyes of a 22-year-old who considers herself up-to-date and worldly-wise, show up how much she doesn't really know about world events or how to perceive people.<br /><br />Or are those the perceptions of the author? He's written better books.<br /><br />Smart though he is, this is not his milieu. Serena's family doesn't ring true. Does she herself have other friends?<br /><br />However, most of the small mysteries are cleared up by the end of the book.

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My kids literally bounce from one thing to another most of the time, until I introduced this app to them. They will sit for hours playing the different games that make up this app. There are so many options within the game for playing different ways, which I found is what keeps them from getting bored. The older ones teach the younger ones how to play and help them along the way, while both are learning at the same time. I brought this out at a family reunion last month to keep my kids occupied and it turned into the favorite thing for all the kids to do. I had to pry my tablet from their hands to show some pictures to family members, and then they snatched it back to play more. I would normally be upset about this, but I know they're playing this game.<br />Great app and I wish I had discovered it sooner!

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I think you learn something every day you just have to keep looking,  seek and you shall find.<br />I loved it.
B005LAIIGW|3.0|First off, I could not understand how the whole premise of this film could have occurred in the first place. Did the Russians shoot down their own satellite which caused the space debris? Surely the international community would not have allowed such an event to transpire if such consequences were possible?<br /><br />I hated Sandra bullocks character. There were a few scenes that dragged on far too long and some which were completely out of sync with the serious tone of the film. One was a scene of her continuing to talk even though her oxygen was at 2%. Another was a scene of her talking to a chinese guy on earth repeating woof woof sounds. I couldn't wait for that scene to end.<br /><br />I didn't understand why clooney's character chose to cut himself loose in the scene where bullock was barely holding onto him. Maybe someone can explain this.<br /><br />Clooney's character brought a lot of charisma and humour to the film but had the negative effect of highlighting Bullock's awkward and hysterical nature. In a disaster/survival movie I want to watch smart, calm and resourceful characters not incompetent, edgy characters with emotional issues.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|I am a Persona fanatic. I love all things that come from Atlus, but this series is by far one of the best. (Of course, Devil Survivor is also good!) Persona 4 Golden is a really great remake of the PS2 version. I specifically purchased a PS Vita for this game. I even pre-ordered P4G before I even had the Vita itself. One of my only complaints about the remake is that they changed Chie's voice, which I adored in the original game. Now she sounds nasally or like she has a cold all the time.<br /><br />The added features are really great. I like that I can go onto the game and listen to the soundtrack if I want. I also find the other additional features, like the TV show stuff, to be entertaining. Being able to fast-forward is also helpful if, like me, you've already played the original. I admit that sometimes watching the same stuff multiple times can be annoying.<br /><br />I also like how they added a new character, and that you can explore the town the moment you get there. The graphics are also pretty flawless for this remake. If you are a Persona fan, this is a must have for your collection. It is definitely worth the money, and, in my opinion, buying a Vita for.

B000001GQY|5.0|These historically significant concerto recordings were made in 1972 and the Opus 116 pieces followed in 1975. The recordings are well matched and all sound well, particularly considering their vintage. In terms of vintage, these performances have gained in stature relative to other recordings as time has passed. This is simply because in the course of time many of the newer recordings which might have superseded these have been found wanting in a variety of ways.<br /><br />On the subject of recording, this 'original bit mastering' has a slightly improved sound quality when compared to the previous CD issue. In general terms there is improved 'presence' and 'bite' while at the same time there is an increase of warmth to the overall sound. Only by careful comparison using wide ranging replay equipment was this really apparent. it is possible that these somewhat subtle differences may not be significant on other equipment. As an upgrade move from a previous issue, it seems that money might be better spent elsewhere.<br /><br />As readings of these concertos and solo works, and at the same time as considering Gilel's playing in an historical context, it is also important to recognise the invaluable support he received from his musical colleagues, both Jochum and the BPO, individually and corporately. The overall body of sound and its balance has been well caught be the engineers as described above and in the context of my own replay equipment.<br /><br />The performances themselves are magisterial in general conception and are conceived on a large, even epic scale. This is certainly true of the more dramatic first concerto but is also a fair comment as regards the second. There are other fine ways of viewing these concertos of course which is why no one version of core repertoire such as this can realistically be described as definitive. Gilels, for example, does not start to match the sheer drive of a Richter in the second concerto or the graceful elegance of a Backhaus in the same concerto. Curzon with Szell cannot be ignored in the first concerto and Fleisher, also with Szell, delivers memorable recordings of both concertos. In terms of modern versions, those by Friere and Chailly are much praised but my personal preference is for the warmth and humanity of Angelich.<br /><br />As the above paragraph attempts to show, there is a wealth of superb versions available on disc, all sounding well, which have equal claim to be considered as top choices in their different ways without any needing to be quoted as the definitive best.<br /><br />In that context of a wealth of fine recordings now available for the collector, this set by Gilels is the equal of any of the others. I have every sympathy with those who find it pre-eminent. The fine set of opus 116 pieces makes a very welcome bonus. They are also delivered at an equally exalted level.<br /><br />It therefore seems only reasonable to suggest to potential purchasers that this disc by Gilels deserves to be considered only amongst the very best. Keen collectors will want several versions of these core works, possibly including all of those listed above at least. That is really the best answer and the most enriching.aus in the same concerto.

B0098460O4|5.0|It is hard to imagine so much talent in such young singers.  Most opera stars spend years perfecting their voice, for these two it just comes natural.  The entire album is absolutely beautiful.  The music will move you to tears even if you do not like opera.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I was never a Liberace fan (although I never disliked him), and I strongly dislike both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. I would never willingly see anything with either of those two actors in it. So why on earth did I watch this? I don't know, but I enjoyed it!<br /><br />Neither of them is really a good actor. They obviously thought (and millions seem to agree) that they were breaking brave new ground and showcasing their immense talents in these roles, but they were just playing the same characters they (and all other Hollywood A-listers) always play: themselves, with various amounts of makeup and choreography and voice coaching to vary the monotony enough to satisfy the mindless masses who pay to see them on screen.<br /><br />The best I can say about Damon is that most of the time he's easy to ignore in this movie, at least when he has clothes on; his body is so weird that it hurts my eyes, but there's nearly always something interesting to look away at. His barely-suppressed homophobia (Damon's, not the character's) comes shining through in the interview on the DVD, and it comes in handy when he gets to repulse a request Douglas makes in one of their many sex scenes. That's only one of many reasons Damon has always given me the creeps: homosexuality gives HIM the creeps.<br /><br />But Douglas... Ahhhh! He's nothing like Liberace, but I had a ball watching him just being little Michael Douglas speaking with a funny voice, moving in a funny way, and sporting killer makeup and killer duds. There's something fascinating about him despite my intense dislike of him as both a person and an actor.<br /><br />Enjoying this movie won't turn me into a fan, but it was fun for the couple of hours it lasted. Not great fun, but fun enough not to turn off, which is quite a feat for a big-budget Hollywood movie.<br /><br />One complaint: it was stupid to have Douglas recite rather than sing \\"The Impossible Dream\\" in his last scene. Liberace was a competent singer, and since Douglas evidently can't sing it was dumb not to have a singer dub his voice then. It could have been done seamlessly so the audience never suspected it wasn't him singing. His plodding recitation of the song's silly lyrics ruined what might otherwise have been a fabulous scene. It doesn't matter that Liberace recited it himself; it should have been sung in that scene.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love this. My only complaint is that the frame or edges will not stay set.  If you accidentally tap the edge it spins. One frustrating glitch won't keep me from playing. Lots of free choices!
B00FFVML74|5.0|Aside from the comments that others have written, the format is perfect because it is self-contained - 8 episodes, and it's over.  Kind of like Twin Peaks, which just did not know when to stop and went off the rails.  This is just about he best acting I've ever seen, the soundtrack was perfectly atmospheric, and as another commented - I feel like these are real people.  The folks on Law & Order - not so much.  These people could be my neighbors.
0316224588|5.0|The plot starts out slowly, but Rankin writes so well that you won't care<br />The Inspector Fox chapters almost seem to be blended in to generate interest in the new series--Fox might be more likable if he wasn't attacking our hero Rebus.

Many fascinating details and viewpoints, for example: the Slaughter of the Innocents probably never happened, since Herod had several contemporary historians and nobody even mentions what would have been a shocker.<br />He writes in a very accessible style, but the chapter notes prove he has done copious research to back his opinions.

It basically about nearly five hundred years in the future where a new society developed out of the former United States. It tell a  little about its history and a rebelling that cause the start of the hunger games and why. The nation is spilt into 12 or 13 districts where each districts is tasked into one or two major product. If you were born in a region that majored in farming or mining or fishing. That you would do it for your entire life. Travel in basically forbidden between the other districts. And the most of the technology is in the capitol city of this society.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|What an emotional story that tugs at your heartstrings and pulls at you to the deepest level of emotions. I found many times throughout the story teardrops falling from the the corners of my soul. There is heartache, joy, tenderness,  pain, regret, sacrifice,..so much enfolded into this masterpiece and told with such depth you can almost feel the oppression that the women lived through. A most beautiful love story is told inside the pages of this novel. The love between a mother and her children and what she will go through to protect them. A love between a little girl and her father whom she cherishes in spite of his faults. A love between a woman and a man that started way back in the frailties of youth that never wavered. Then a love between two women that started out with anger and resentment and ended with the ultimate sacrifice. So much life is told in this story that I can never express what a gripping tale this is except to say it has left a permanent mark on my heart and soul.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Recently saw Nate Reuss singing with Pink and since I haven't &#34;heard&#34; of him before, I did a little browsing of the Amazon music, discovered that I heard him before just didn't know it.  I listened to a few tracks and picked this album.  I think it's a good album to get the &#34;roots&#34; of this singer.  A few more hits and collaborations and he could be this generation's Leo Sayer (how's that for a way-back reference?)

B00006I53S|3.0|I've had this now for about 3 1/2 years now. It's my most used lens. There are so many Pros and Cons with this particular item and I'll just share a bit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Price<br />-good upgrade from the stock 18-55mm<br />-Range flexibility<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Zooming in or out tends to feel sticky at times, not like a smooth transition as you'd like it to be.<br />-Attaching a lens hood to the end of this will of course add weight and will therefore extend your lens all the way out while you're on-the-go. I always have to retract mine whenever I notice that someone's bumped into me or I bump into some random object. Feels like an inconvenience.<br />-Not so much a premium build/feel. But hey, you get for what you pay for right? Kinda makes me wonder why this is the standard lens for the Canon 7D<br /><br />All in all it's just an ok lens. Nothing special. I use this on a Canon T1i and no I'm obviously not a professional photographer but I can tell the subtle differences in objects. Anyways, I would recommend this to any average amateur photographer.

B0087ITBPC|5.0|I found myself wondering thru 90% of this movie , \\"How in the world did they get Barbra to do this\\" ?  Then the end rolled around and it was so clear.  Well done delivered a great message (which I won't spoil). After reading many of the other reviews here on Amazon, I couldn't help but come back to add a comment.  This movie (in my opinion) is so much more than a Mother/Son flick. Am I the only one who was hit over the head with such a powerful message? I know I can't be the only guy in the world that wonders how or if my life had actually touched another's.

B005ES11YW|5.0|I love my original crocs but they were not as supportive as these.  Too bad the Crocs company don't make these sport duet's any more.<br />Warning! Even the crocs site says to go a size smaller if you wear a 1/2 size. Don't do it! I had to return a pair that was on super sale because I order a size 10 for my size 10 1/2 foot.  The size 11 was actually sized perfect for 10 1/2 shoes.  These are much more substantial than the standard crocs and work especially well In grass. As said, kind of like little tanks  but they are very, very light. Since my first pair of original crocs have lasted over 5 years: I am very excited to anticipate many years of wear on these babies!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This story about a young man within the Autism Spectrum who works as a genetics researcher/professor and his growing understanding that life as he has crafted it for himself lacks something; love and companionship is very well written.  The character rings very true (as the parent of three high functioning autism spectrum young adults I can attest) and the other characters are well written also.  In fact, I was so involved in the lives of Don and Rosie as well as Claudia and Gene that I found I had a hard time putting the book down once I got started reading.  I am really looking forward to more books from Mr. Simsion.

B0073COMUW|2.0|An obvious use for LEB bulbs that don't have filaments to tear is a garage door opener. Just one of these will cause your garage remotes to stop working. If you wait for the timeout for the lights to kick back off, remotes worked fine. RF interference is common in the transformers converting the AC power from your socket to DC that the LED used. This manufacturer skimped on the transformer and its shielding, resulting in lots of interference around it. The package as well as the unit itself has no sign of any FCC rating on it.<br /><br />I read elsewhere that these should be reported to the FCC and should not be legal for sale in US.

B001AH6ZWY|4.0|I saw this film in the theater when it was relaased and this is the first time I've seen it since that time. It's well made, entertaining, and compelling. As a science fiction movie, Contact is OK, as long as you ignore it's lack of faithfulness to Carl Sagan's novel of the same name. It's really a political drama in which the sci-fi element is the MacGuffin.<br /><br />As a time capsule of the late 1990's, it excels at using faked news media to make it seem real. The special effects are excellent. The cynicism in the way government operates, the manipulative abilities of the extremely wealthy, the fairly negative view of humanity, and the emphasis on spirituality and God deliver a conservative message that today's Evangelical Christians and Tea Party should find quite appealing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's one of those movies where you really want the entire movie to be the first 15 minutes because what happens next is more interesting than the first two hours - especially if you're interested in it as a sci-fi film. (Which, of course, would have taken it even further away from Sagen's book.)<br /><br />I must say that I kept wanting Jody Foster to give Matthew McConaughey a good swift kick in the gonads and send him packing, but she never did.<br /><br />This film, while not a masterpiece, is a solid and entertaining film that will hold up well to the test of time. After writing this, I took a look at Roger Ebert's review. I usually find that he and I have similar taste and tend to rate films similarly - although it is often for very different reasons. Roger gave this film 5 stars and thinks it is, in fact, a masterpiece. So, do take a look at Contact and decide for yourself whether Roger Ebert got it right and I got it wrong. NOTE: Don't read Ebert's review before you watch the film as it contains numerous spoilers.

B00EMAGCJM|4.0|The October edition of Rolling Stone exalts \\"Good Golly Miss Miley!\\" and that's a good phrase for her fourth studio effort BANGERZ. One gets the idea that Cyrus expects people to cruise down the road with their bass high, their windows down and her LP on replay. I just don't know that I'd be one of those people--not to say that there aren't plenty of people who will be. I believe I'm in the minority of people who find Cyrus harmless. Yes, she's cavorting half-dressed, \\"twerking\\" and sticking her tongue out, but she's a 20-year-old young woman who thinks she knows more than she does, which is typical of most twentysomethings. She just happens to be a multi-millionaire and international celebrity churned out of the Disney factory--to her detriment and benefit.<br /><br />BANGERZ is innocuous. I was curious and found it to be an interesting mix of music genres, with good intentions, but shaky execution. \\"SMS (Bangerz)\\" will get some attention, not only because it includes the one-and-only Britney Spears, but because it's fun, upbeat and different (as is \\"On My Own,\\" which is a bit funky). It isn't a breakthrough, but it's good enough (especially for someone like me that didn't have too high of expectations). \\"We Can't Stop,\\" Cyrus's first single, is good enough, but better acapella. \\"My Darlin'\\" is interesting--if only for its use of autotune and the appearance of artist Future. Even though I wasn't taken with \\"Wrecking Ball\\" like everyone else (and the Billboard Hot 100), when hearing it as a part of the tracklisting, it's an instant goosebumps sort of reaction: it is the standout of the album. \\"#GETITRIGHT\\" is infectious, which isn't surprising when one sees that it was produced by Pharrell Williams. It's got a whimsical, funky vibe.<br /><br />Cyrus has a unique sound. I used to be one of her detractors: I didn't understand the allure whether it be her acting, artistry or overall role as an entertainer, but she can sing. The issue with BANGERZ is that while some ofthe songs could've been excellent, her voice doesn't blend (FU feat. French Montana is a great example). I think I read somewhere that she made music for girls her age and race: according to Cyrus, they're all listening to rap music and her album was created to fill that niche. I don't think she'll find an issue in that.<br /><br />3.5 stars; janereaderreviews.wordpress.com

B0015T6G2G|4.0|I bought this book while touring So. Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. We visited the Mandela House (where his family lived for 40 years and is now a museum) as well as an Apartheid Museum. Therefore, I became very interested in Nelson Mandela's life. I have not yet finished the book but have found his life fascinating. I had no idea how he grew up and that he went on to become a lawyer. I would definitely recommend the book for anyone who is interested in learning about the history of Africa and apartheid. What an impressive person he is and how dedicated to justice for all. We drove by the house where he is now (dying).
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Full of the great dialogue and plot twists from the first two novels, but now with the characters well known by the reader. An amazing story with multiple levels. I now understand what the fuss is about.

1781162646|4.0|I am waiting for The Shining followup Dr. Sleep and somewhere heard this is a \\"sort of\\" prequel to it.  Well, in a way it kind of is.  I've not seen it mentioned, although someone likely has, but this is Hard Case Crime with the Carny Serial Killer mystery for Devin (and friends) to solve.  However, there are also several cases where \\"the shine\\" shines through as well.  I really liked this story and thought the main characters of importance were very well drawn out.  The story definitely moved right along.  And I find I really like books where I like and become attached to the characters, which I definitely did in this case.  For those of us who are emotional, you will become attached, but I'll not say why.  In any case, it was a very enjoyable read, and I'm glad I took the time to read it.

B00AR1G3FS|5.0|These musicians are super talented. Don Henley WORKING those drums singing Life in the Fast Lane!!! Joe Walsh jamming Life's Been Good to Me in polka dot pants wearing a helmet cam, and I mean JAMMING! Glenn Frey sounding just as we remember him wearing his Miami Vice outfit with the Miami Vice hit You Belong to the City. The biggest surprise was Timothy Schmit who I've never heard of but recognized the song right away (I Can't Tell You Why) as he sung it to perfection. There are 30 songs in all, and I'm sure most people have heard most if they are at least 35 years old. The whole time I was trying to decide which Eagle stole the show, but then I kept changing my mind. I was amazed how the band members kept switching instruments. More than anything, you get an appreciation of what musicians stood for. HARD WORK!

B008JFUNKU|4.0|\\"Captain Phillips\\" is an excellent action-adventure film. It is riveting, suspenseful, exciting, and very well-made. There are no off moments; no built-in \\"bathroom breaks.\\" Somali pirates capturing an American ship off the Horn of Africa is a timely and fraught topic.<br /><br />The film's verisimilitude is so powerful at times I really did drift into thinking that I was watching a documentary. There's a lot of money up on the screen: cargo vessels, beat-up pirate skiffs, ports, open ocean, Navy warships. Even so it was the performances and the pacing that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I found every last character so well played and gripping, right down to the medic who appears toward the end, that I wondered if Director Paul Greenglass had not hired real corpsmen, or real pirates.<br /><br />Sound is used masterfully. Loud, pulsing music suddenly stops at key moments. Yeah, it's an old trick, but it works especially well here.<br /><br />This is the kind of film I am grateful to have seen in a theater, and I am eager to recommend to friends. Even though action-adventure is not my genre, I'd re-watch this film, and that is high praise.<br /><br />This film is so consistently excellent that one must ask why it doesn't raise to the level of a ten-out-of-ten star film. \\"Captain Phillips\\" touches on some of the biggest issues of our times: the collision between the First World and the Third World, poverty in Africa, jihad. \\"Captain Phillips\\" assiduously avoids addressing any of these issues.<br /><br />From this film, viewers would never know that the millions of dollars in ship ransom that pirates claim goes to al-Shabaab, the terrorist group that attacked a mall in Kenya. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) offers rationalizations for piracy: Western nations stole Somalia's fish, and piracy is the \\"tax\\" for that. Pirates made millions of dollars through piracy. Those millions were not pocketed by the pirates themselves, who work for others. No reference is made to Somalis, in 1993, dragging an American soldier through Mogadishu's streets. Americans were attempting to help Somalis after a famine.<br /><br />Phillips does mention that his ship, waylaid by pirates, was carrying food aid for hungry Africans.<br /><br />None of this is gone into in any detail in the script, and it could have been.<br /><br />Rather, the First World - Third World clash, and the clash of civilizations and religions is communicated solely through images, and, in the absence of a complex script, the images speak very loudly.<br /><br />Somalia is depicted as a dusty, dry, hellhole. Somalis are depicted as chaotic, unproductive, violent, angry, greedy, and lawless. Somalis are dressed in discarded Western clothing and plastic sandals, or simply barefoot. They live in huts. They only things they possess that give them any power is the guns that they got from Westerners. Somalis hold life cheaply and are ready to kill and die.<br /><br />Americans are depicted as orderly, disciplined, skilled, courageous, and productive. Americans devote massive amounts of money to saving one life.<br /><br />When the Somali pirates manage to get their ladder against the Maersk Alabama, the image suggests the pirates as invasive parasites attempting to assault a larger, more successful organism. Whereas the Westerners have built a civilization that creates ships and commerce, the Somalis have created only violence, chaos and greed. They must take guns that they themselves can't manufacture and invade more productive peoples in order to survive. It's an ugly picture, and I can completely understand if Somalis are enraged by this film.<br /><br />Andrew O'Hehir, Salon's film critic, apparently was enraged by the film, and he lambasted it. It was distressing to O'Hehir to watch \\"corn-fed, gym-toned\\" Americans struggle against \\"malnourished\\" Africans. That the thin Africans were holding guns to the heads of the Americans did not disturb him. O'Hehir calls the film \\"unpleasant and uncomfortable.\\" He hated watching American military rescue an American hostage. What a sick dude, you want to say. But his view is all too common.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this movie. It could have been an all-time classic if the script had offered some insight into the issues the images depicted.table.\\" He hated watching American military rescue an American hostage.

B006O5Y75Y|4.0|Given that most of the sequels to the original Charlton Heston &#34;Planet of the Apes,&#34; a chance was taken in ordering this film. Surprise, surprise... it was actually... good! Ah,  yes, there are some who may quibble about some of the &#34;science&#34; behind the aromatic infection of the apes themselves, following the lead of the.. well, lead ape, but the cinematics were extremely well done. The apes in films of this genre in the past seemed to lack that human quality present with these lead animals... and, they performed extremely well under the adept direction of Rupert Wyatt. Lithgow's performance was also well handled by this lead character actor, as his mental state rose and fell with the script. What can truly make a movie is to watch those in supporting casts... one expects finished performances from the lead actors, and, unfortunately, many in this category are without merit in some of the latest films. The neighbor is played well, with the correct amount of angst and anger. The extras were obviously were not simply told to mill about... they were, or so it appears, actually directed and added the flavor of confusion, threat avoidance, horror and fear. This is a good, solid flick and one of its most outstanding elements was the lack of animal violence committed upon the duplicitous, dippy humans... unless, of course, the latter were involved in the slaying of apes, baboons, orangutans and the like. If they did, then they paid the price. One of the letdowns were the scenes involving the California Highway Patrol and their high flying chopper... I simply could not believe they were that stupid or given orders by someone who was not involved as an officer with their agency. All in all, a better film than one might have expected... just make certain you have plenty of bananas on hand if the going gets rough.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book.  Not mind-blowing literature, but it will keep you reading and thinking about what you would do if you were put in any of the situations the main characters find themselves in.
B00DIQWQUU|5.0|i haven 't stopped playing this pretty much nonstop since it came out.  it's engaging and ignorable, perfect \\"ambient\\" music that really runs the gamut and is quite emotional in some parts. a great many of the sounds employed are clean, eighties style \\"keyboard\\" sounds, almost like presets or snippets from a sound library cd that Korg made.  it's really hard to explain (like all music) but he twists these into new shapes and spaces---the overall effect is very warm and inviting. think the em:t series from the mid to late 90's and you're almost there in terms of wide open digital warmth.  it's the closest thing to a modern art of noise record we're likely to get--an exercise in the actual art of noise.

B00CH26TL8|3.0|I enjoy this game well enough however it cheats. It's fun and easy to play but I hate a game that draws you in stating it is &quot;free&quot; and then proves to be programmed to keep you from advancing unless you spend money on it. No wonder so many people are broke, after the cost of the device itself, the warranty, the connection and sign up fees and the cost of WiFi or data it requires you to spend MORE money to play a &quot;free&quot; game. It's a good thing that libraries still exist and that reading is free and fun.

B00BGI08GG|5.0|Here's the deal:<br /><br />DC Fans:<br />Don't expect this to be an exact representation or a simple origin story for the Green Arrow. As any comic book reader knows, there are always multiple adaptations on a story. This is exactly that. The back story was obviously built off of Andy Diggle's adaptation of the Green Arrow, the rest is pulled, mixed and matched to this creative adaptation that proves to be one of the best superhero adaptations I have ever seen with small references throughout the series to well know and not-so well known characters, cities, and events.<br /><br />Average TV Goer:<br />Pros:<br />Creative Action Scenes<br />Fast Paced<br />Two major story lines every episode, so there is a backstory continuously running along with a current story.  The switch makes for an amazing show that holds the interest of those with even the shortest attention spans without sacrificing plot.<br />Minor Cons (For most people):<br />Predicting long term events without comic book knowledge might not happen<br />This is a CW show, therefore<br />  Love triangles<br />  Half season of build up to get to what the show is really about.<br /> Season 1 builds to season 2, but they are almost different shows (I prefer season 2)<br /><br />Note that the show cannot be judged until the second half.<br />Note Oliver's inner monologue eventually ceases (thank you world!!)<br />Note deeper morality comes into play season 2<br />Character growth in the series is amazing!!!!<br /><br />If you like this show you might be interested in:<br />Lost because of general show set up<br />Smallville because of superhero interests<br />Being human because of morality<br />The Vampire Diaries because you are a teen bopper that likes a little story with their love triangles (no shame)<br />The Originals because you love the story and action, but are not interested in the teen bopper love triangle obsessions.<br /><br />Scrubs - because it has nothing to do with Arrow but everyone should watch Scrubs,<br /><br />I hope this review helped and maybe made you laugh. Let me know if you have questions,<br /><br />Side note: props to Stephen Amell, Colton Haynes, and especially Emily Bet Rockards for great acting very quickly after their respective introductions to the series.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|I have played this game from the first day. It was fair and you had a chance at winning and getting items to complete the rooms. Now it is to hard and to many people in each room fighting for the same thing. There needs to be more rooms open and more shadow cards. I wish this game was like it use to be.

B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Robert Downey is amusing and the movie is fun.  The special effects overwhelm some of the plot.  It is good summer movie that doesn't ask too much of its audience.
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|Love This Show!!! Great cast, writing, directing and just plain fun!!! The wit and comedic timing of new girl can not be beat!!!
0451419243|5.0|This is one of two of Follett's historical series and it is an epic tale of the 20th century seen from the perspective of several countries and the characters who originate in each.  You see how their lives intersect and how they are caught up in the great dramas of this century.  What a fun way to review history.  There is intrigue, battle, romance and much to capture your interest.  I am looking forward to the final book in the trilogy which comes out in 2014.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I loved how the characters stayed with me long after I read the book. To me, that's a sign of a well-written novel. This book gives you much to think about, long after you're done reading it.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I knew that there would be a sad ending but the entire series was great insight to some of the hidden things Rome was into.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Riveting and addictive. Human nature is incredibly complex. I need to take a break before I tackle his next works.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down. The writing techniques Flynn used to tell this story and also make it a metaphor for modern relationships and marriages was brilliant. Such a week written thriller and extremely funny and entertaining!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I am a Planet of The Apes fan from Charlton Heston, Roddy MacDowell days. They were fun.  I like the remake with Mark Wahlberg, and I like how this movie goes back to show how the apes took over.  For all of you who think we have evolved from apes, you will enjoy this movie.  Personally, I don't believe we evolved from apes, but I always wondered what talking apes sound like.  I thought it was entertaining!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I Love this show, I am addicted. And the character of Harvey Specter is spectacular, not to mention extremely handsome.

B0007DAZW8|4.0|This is the most &#34;electro&#34; album that Daft Punk has to offer. It is really 'hard' and the bass is great
B00DBISUWS|3.0|I hopped on the Goldfrapp bandwagon around 2006/2007 with &#34;Supernature&#34;. I liked &#34;Number 1&#34; enough to buy that album. I was not familiar with &#34;Felt Mount&#34; or &#34;Black Cherry&#34;. I have been a fan of Goldfrapp ever since, and I've accumulated all of their albums. This week, I listened to &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; at least 10 times while I also listened to &#34;Felt Mountain&#34;, &#34;Black Cherry&#34;, &#34;Supernature&#34;, &#34;Seventh Tree&#34; and &#34;Head First&#34; to put &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; into perspective.<br /><br />Goldfrapp has the same struggle that Dido has (they both began around the same time) and that is this--to rock or not to rock? Both artists have dreamy arrangements with pleasant breathy vocals, but what to do? Should I rock out or keep it mellow? &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; is dreamy. The only time it rocks out is &#34;Thea&#34;, and that's not saying much. As other reviewers have pointed out already &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; is a cross between &#34;Felt Mountain&#34; and &#34;Seventh Tree&#34;, but I would say it's more like &#34;Felt Mountain&#34;. If viewed from that angle, &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; is a return to Goldfrapp's earliest roots then.<br /><br />That being said, &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; is an odd album. Ten songs about, well, I'm not sure. I'll send you post card when I get there. Nothing lyrically hit me. I got to thinking that, generally, Goldfrapp isn't an artist I go to for the lyrics. No, I go to Goldfrapp for the soundscapes and ethereal moods. Like Dido, but I think I like Dido's lyrics more, they resonate with me more. Then again, Alison Goldfrapp may purposely avoid easy comprehension (much like Tori Amos). At any rate, &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; appears to be about 10 different people on the surface at least. I could only remember the tracks where the titles were said clearly and several times such as &#34;Annabel&#34; or &#34;Simone&#34; and &#34;Laurel&#34;. The rest of the tracks--good luck. I don't recall song with title here, just melody with track number. It's true that most of the songs operate from one type of sound, but within that, there appears to be many variations. It's like looking at a painting for a while and noticing different parts that you initially didn't see at first. That's &#34;Tales Of Us&#34;.<br /><br />I'm not saying this elevates &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; to classic status, because it doesn't, but &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; is a mature work that I think is multi-layered and dramatic in a James Bond theme sort of way--especially &#34;Drew&#34;. It go me thinking--why not Goldfrapp for the next James Bond theme? They'd do great! Goldfrapp probably wouldn't agree to it--too mainstream. And that's just it, Goldfrapp always seem to avoid the mainstream even when they are doing the mainstream like &#34;Supernature&#34; or &#34;Head First&#34;.<br /><br />So, &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; is definitely for the fans, like myself. But, it could also be for newcomers who are completely unfamiliar with Goldfrapp and are just now jumping on the bandwagon. I thought &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; was okay, meaning, it didn't break any new ground, but it did sort of refine the old Goldfrapp balladry. They do this type of music well, like Dido, heck, like Jane Siberry, too, or maybe even Enya as well as Loreena McKennitt--I could go on and on, but I digress. I see only 22 reviews posted here as of 10/11/13, one month after the album's release. This says to me that Goldfrapp isn't very popular in America, and that's fine by me. I don't want them to be overexposed here. As long as they chart and sell in the U.K. that's fine by me.<br /><br />You should buy &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; if you are a long time fan, and you don't expect &#34;Supernature&#34; or &#34;Head First&#34;. Like I said, this is for the fans, especially the ones that liked &#34;Felt Mountain&#34;. In the future, I would like to see the duo take some real artistic risks. They've proven they're good at two things--dreamy balladry with a cinematic feel, and synth pop dance circa 1982. What else have you got? Show us next time. Throw us fans a real curve ball.<br /><br />Here's how &#34;Tales Of Us&#34; compares to Goldfrapp's other works:<br /><br />2000 Felt Mountain: Four Stars<br />2003 Black Cherry: Three Stars<br />2005 Supernature: Four Stars<br />2008 Seventh Tree: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 Head First: Three and a Half Stars<br />2013 Tales Of Us: Three and a Half Starsry with a cinematic feel, and synth pop dance circa 1982.

B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's okay. I wish that it was easier to get upgrades. No real replay value.  Would be good to add some variety to this app.
0783240287|1.0|.....from a seller called &#34;deep_discount_dvd_cd&#34; that worked only 3/4's of the way into the movie. I ruled out the possibility of the DVD player we watched on being broken, by watching 2 other DVD's with absolutely no problem. When I contacted the seller to make a return, I was taken to a page where a bar code printed up and a return label to the seller. Upon mailing the DVD back, I was charged $10.64 for returning it to the sender. I have NO movie, and am out $ 10.64 for the shipping to send it back, as well as the $ 3.99 I was charged for shipping when I ordered it. PLEASE find a reputable seller and purchase this movie........ it is a phenomenal musical!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have to be honest. This is not the type of book that I normally read. I am a paranormal romance action adventure type of girl. I took a chance and got this book because of the rave reviews.  I am so glad that I did because this book was fantastic.  It will take you on a roller coaster of emotions and I couldn't put it down. I don't want to give anything away so ill leave it at that. I highly recommend this book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not the best; not the worst. It falls into the category of time filler. Wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I love this movie. I personally like the whole reboot of the existing history of the Stat Trek that we have all loved for so many years. Think of all the stories yet untold.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is the best! Is there more to say? I got addicted to this app!!! :D I think you and everybody should get this app!

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good movie.  Well thought out. Sounds like they are leaving room  for a sequel. Nice surprise ending, though. Good job!
B008JFUORW|2.0|So the second Hangover movie was almost a remake of the first.  And this one had a unique plot.  It explored the character of Mr. Chow.  I didn't have the feeling of the guys being normal characters.  There has never been much of an explanation of Alan.  He has a long arrest history and does drugs, in this one a mental condition requires him to take medication.  The guys stage an intervention and they agree to drive him to a rehab clinic in Arizona.  From here, someone kidnaps Doug (for a friend they care about so much, he sure is missing from all the action) in exchange for Mr. Chow.  Now, it is a journey from Tiajuana to Las Vegas to find him and rescue Doug.  The plot isn't strong; there are great stunts, but it doesn't compare to the first movie.  Not bad for a watch though.  Wait a few months and it'll be in the $5 bin while the first movie still stands strong.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is in my Top 10 mobile games.  If you are looking for something that keeps your interest and has a decent amount of strategy this is the game for you.
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|I've greatly enjoyed his other original works, but this one felt slapped together.  It's as if the publisher wants to get as much product out to the street as quickly as possible, and is willing to take any story from the author.<br /><br />Very few interesting/unpredictable twists, the main character was more annoying that sympathetic; the list goes on and on.<br /><br />This is the first from the author I've actively disliked, and I really hope the next Stormlight Archive book returns to the level of quality I've come to expect.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Purchased for my mother. Loved her gift and watched the night I gave it to her. She loves this movie
B00BAXFDLM|4.0|Have been starving for some decent sci-fi lately, and this fit the bill.  Plot's pretty good, universe has big enough ideas that I'm looking forward to future books.  Only complaint is the action is curiously muted.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|I've been a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins since about 1998.  Their early stuff from Gish, Pieces, Siamese and Mellon Collie are pretty much the pinnacle of rock and roll greatness.  Aeroplane Flies High album is a set of tracks that were recorded during the Mellon Collie sessions but never made it to the album but a few songs were featured on 4 of the EPs that were released promoting the album.  It's just a great collection for any Pumpkin fan to own.  I have the original Aeroplane Flies High set and I just had to get the re-mastered re-release.
859037985X|5.0|This book is so concise and to the point it's ridiculous. The chapters flow together very nicely. It's a breeze to read and understand. It took me about 10 hours to read this book in its entirety and I honestly feel like I am a master in the language now.<br /><br />A++ would buy again
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really an enjoyable read. This novel is a great sequel to \\"The Shining\\"' Mr. King is at the top of his game, and story is so good. It has just the right amount of nostalgia for the first book, but creates a new plot line that stands really well all by itself. As a long time reader and fan of Mr. Kings writing, this book was a joy to read. I would recommend it to any fan of horror and thriller novels. I truly believe that Stephen King is one of the best novelists around. His books are always a joy to read, and \\"Doctor Sleep\\" adds to the list.
B004I744AS|4.0|I do really enjoy having this on my iPhone. I can pull it out when ever i need to without opening a browser to look up a word. convenient
B000IOM0WY|4.0|I saw this movie before and really liked it. We haven't had a chance to watch this one in Blu Ray yet. I'm sure it will be better in this format. Ordered it because I really liked it when I saw it.

1451648537|5.0|[[ASIN:0985394986 Profiles in Leadership: From Caesar to Modern Times]]<br /><br />Steve Jobs was a technological entrepreneur who generated a cascade of new ideas.  This book is a beginning to explore his leadership skills. The impression is one of a tyrant but this is deceptive.  The stories show that he had the ability to persuade, convince and inspire others to follow him.  He had strong leadership qualities like knowing what he wanted it, articulating it and casting it as a corporate and personal vision for all to achieve.<br /><br />Many of the concepts are included in my new book, \\"Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times.\\" The first chapter of \\"Profiles\\" deals with leadership theory and practice and the concept of being able to \\"lead ourselves\\" before we lead others. The essence of the book is the Leadership Secrets, Leadership Traits, Leadership Lessons and Words of Wisdom of several larger than life leaders: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Napoleon, Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher and Oprah Winfrey. Each faced enormous challenges and taught us life long leadership lessons that are as fresh today as they were when they led others. They give us insights that we can use at this moment and every moment. The book is designed to be a compass and road map for leaders of all ages.<br /><br />\\"Steve Jobs\\" is worth reading.  Professor Isacson is a splendid writer. This bio of Steve Jobs goes hand in glove with Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times for anyone interested in delving into the world of leadership from the past to the present.

B00942Y4IY|1.0|I watched this movie last night with my ten year old son. We both groaned, and his taste in film isn't even, err, developed.  I don't have the energy to describe how surprisingly bad it is so I'll borrow some quotes and passages from other reviews that hit home:<br /><br />\\"What might have been an interesting sci-fi about the origins of the pyramids and civilization as a whole is a clumsly, plodding mess filled with two-dimensional characters, nonsensical plot machinations, and cheesy f/x. It's also needlessly long.  * * *I guess there are a lot of people out there who eat crumbs and think it's a meal. This movie wishes it were crumbs. It's more like carpet sweepings and broken glass.\\"<br /><br />Cliché-riddled story line that would make a ten-year-old groan - must have been written by xeroxing pages at random from every other third-rate sci-fi script over the past twenty years. * * * The utter and complete lack of originality is truly breathtaking.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everything about this film is poor; the directing is poor, the scriptwriting is poor, the acting is bad, the music is awful. There are so many faults in this movie I couldn't possibly list them all, but here are a few of the worst things about the film. The actions and situations of the people are so unrealistic it is laughable (I thought Spielberg was the master of this but this director takes it to an all-time low). We have the most important discovery in the history of mankind and it's left in the hands of a bunch of people who you wouldn't even trust to cook your dinner for you. They send in a bunch of Marines who are like a group of 10 year-old boys on their first scouting expedition, led by Kurt Russell who walks around like a John Wayne on Mogadon. The James Spader character is an imbecile who can't even talk without getting flustered and somehow he manages to decipher the hieroglyphics that the experts have been working on for years as soon as he walks into the room. It's rife with cliches and stereotypes, the first ten shots of Kurt Russell has him lighting up and taking a puff of a cigarette (no it doesn't make you look tough !) and the female elderly lady speaks in her fake foreign accent, stares when she speaks and smirks to herself like she knows everything about everything - it's absolutely cringeworthy. The plagiarisms are also too many to name, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, the Time Machine, they're all here. The music is loud, constant, overused and so irritating its almost unbearable to watch. The shameful thing is, that underneath it all lies the potential of a really good film. The egyptian connections and the idea of a porthole to another place in the universe was a concept of great promise. Sadly the makers of this film obliterated any hope of anything worthwhile coming out of it. The director and producer are largely to blame, the acting is bad but even Al Pacino would not have saved this film.\\"

B008Y768XO|2.0|One word... Depressing. This is a \\"Feel Bad\\" movie. I wish I could un-ring this bell. Movie received 2 stars because it was well made, just not a good story at all.
078518533X|4.0|While the graphic novel can't go into much of the detail of the book. I was glad to see that it was consistent with the story.

1476727651|5.0|Stephen King writes his first sequel, and hits it out of the park.  We return to the land of 'The Shining' here and are treated to glimpses of some long-lost friends: Hallorrann the cook, the naked old lady from the bathtub, Lloyd, Wendy, and most importantly, Danny Torrance, later known as Dan.  The story in Doctor Sleep is Dan's tale, and we get to follow him and Tony (Redrum) as life takes twists we wouldn't wish on our most annoying neighbor.  The story is a taut one, with lots of short chapters, good dialogue, and nary a wasted scene.  The evil encountered in this book isn't anywhere near as intense as it was in 'The Shining' and the cartoon-like feel of the villains works against the suspense, but it's a page-turner, and well-worth your time.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|I like most of the songs, Miley and her team are creative in creating this album full of variety flavors. I love ballads so my favorite tracks are Adore You, Someone else, Hands in the Air and the best is of Wrecking Ball (so emotional charge!) We can't stop and Drive, 4x4, #GetItRight...are pretty fun, too!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked this novel but it was predictable in the end and there was too much description.  I thought it was important that it showcased the child labor problem in orphanages.
1601251505|5.0|If you are a fan of Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, then this game is for you!<br />It is 3.5 edition revised
B00EQF0JJC|4.0|I love the tale Much Ado About Nothing.  I saw the previous version with Denzel Washington and enjoyed the cute storyline.  This reimagining by Joss Whedon is very likable.  The acting is mostly good and it like of adds more to the story than the previous version did, which is actually kind of nice.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story was more than interesting, and kept my attention from start to finish.  I thought the ending was especially good .. what might have been!
B00DMEQP46|5.0|It's easy to spin a mainstream pop record down the track list, being the same person in the end as you were before the listen.  However, MGMT offers a musically mind expanding journey by pushing the limits on what our perception of music really can really be.  Throughout history, greatness is often rejected at first; it takes a bit for the collective to catch up with the pioneering artsits.  With an album like this, expect 3-4 full listens before you begin to rise up to their frequency.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's only flaw is how short the game is. But that isn't a flaw because of how addictive this game is.
B008035H16|4.0|This book has showed me another way of thinking to do the business, by creating happiness to our customers could eventually maintain a higher customer satisfaction. Which is an important factor to increase the customer loyalty.<br />I would recommend this book to my friends who are about to start making business by their own, and share them the idea of how important the customer service is.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love those Minions!!  Graphics. are cool Loads of fun. I enjoy playing with and against friends.  I play it every day during lunch.  It is a great stress relieved!
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|This seller I don't like his products. They're sloppily made and stop in the middle of the movie and start from the beginning. The last half is not playing. This is 2nd time with same results.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book captures the essence of young love and the beauty it withholds. Being a teenager myself, it shows how love effects a young heart. Even though Hazel really isn't a normal girl, it so easy to relate to her feelings. This book pulls at every hear string and it's utterly amazing.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|This app works amazingly well, but when I tried to install the streamer on a third PC, the website never allowed me to download it. I concluded Splashtop HD doesn't allow it but also won't tell you there's a limit.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Although many critics dismissed Bob Dylan's 1970 album Self Portrait when it first appeared, this set here features the missing pieces to the puzzle it makes up. The earliest selection outside this latest Bootleg Series' time frame is a recording of Minstrel Boy from 1967's Basement Tapes which serves more of a sketch piece than its' actual performance piece as part of the infamous Isle Of Wight performance two years hence with the Band[Originally the Hawks, then as The Crackers around the BT period]. Mostly we get a bare-bones sketch of half of SP as well as outtakes and alternate versions of Nashville Skyline and New Morning recordings. On the latter one, though, we get overdubbed versions of some tracks including the title cut of NM which gives Dylan a Stax-sounding feel to it. The stripped-down version of All The Tired Horses is actually refreshing as opposed to the orchestrated one that opened SP. The demo version of When I Paint My Masterpiece is in its' most honest form of reading. This collection here is the best of Dylan's country phase. But the real treat here on this deluxe edition is the Isle Of Wight show of Dylan and The Band.<br />Truly a must! Get it while you can and enjoy it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|another excellent king novel. great characters as always. good to see danny again :) highly recommend to all king crazies!!!!
B000002IR9|5.0|This album here is Stax's answer to the pairing of Motown artists Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell by combining two of its' own label mates Otis Redding and Carla Thomas together for their soul-singing efforts. To start with it kicks off their rendition of label-mate Eddie Floyd's Knock On Wood with more or less the same musicians used on the original recording[Nothing better than hearing that distinctive bass-line by &#34;Duck&#34; Dunn]. My favorite here is a rendition of Lowell Fulson's Tramp, which strikes me as a humorous down<br />play on one's character as we here Carla chewing down then spitting Otis out with her words[Just in case you didn't know, there's also a promo clip of Tramp depicting how Carla describes Otis-a farm boy, then he strikes back showing off his suit with pockets of money and all his cars. But Carla wasn't seen in that clip at all yet you hear her]. We also get renditions of Tell It Like It Is, It Takes Two(Speaking of Motown-Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston), When Something Is Wrong With My Baby(By label-mates Sam & Dave) and Bring It on Home to Me. Lovey-Dovey is a sweet item as well as Ooh Carla, Ooh Otis. Note that this album was Otis' 6th and final studio effort and it was Carla's 4th. Truly a Stax classic!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a great story that kept me interested and smiling most of the time.  The end could h have developed more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game it is very challenging competing against Friends too make the top of the leader board very fun
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It would be the best game ever if it downloaded faster. The other people at my school has it and it looked fun to play so i got it.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|One word comes to mind when describing Tiny Thief: ADORABLE! Seeing how I'm a big fan of Angry Birds, when I found out that Tiny Thief was produced by Rovio Stars, I instantly bought it from Google Play. For its price, there weren't a lot of levels. A total of 30 levels so far (six chapters). I hope there's an update soon!<br /><br />That's not to say that the game isn't enjoyable. It's VERY fun and entertaining! I enjoyed every minute of it! The graphics are whimsical and polished. The characters are quirky and zany. The music is so charming and the story is reminiscent of a medieval period (but with playfulness and humor).<br /><br /> Your job (as the Tiny Thief) is to pilfer items without being detected by the guards. This is sort of a point and click game. You point to the area you want to go to (it's very area specific) then you click on the image of a hand (or other symbol) in order to grab or interact with the object. You can also go up/down ladders, hide in barrels and so forth. You start off with a tutorial that shows you how to play the game. It's very easy to learn (my nephew who is six, got the hang of the tutorial).<br /><br />Often, Tiny Thief does honorable deeds such as saving a sad piggy from a cruel guard or returning money to a child which was stolen from a cruel, corrupt sheriff. So even though Tiny Thief steals, he has a big heart (like Robin Hood).<br /><br />You can get past the guards, tyrants and ever-watchful characters by means of distraction and sneakiness. (For example: by making the guard chase a runaway chicken) If the guards or other character see you, you fail the mission and must repeat it. Luckily, you don't start at the very beginning of the level. Personally, I found the gameplay to be rather slow. I wish its pace was a bit faster.<br /><br /> I had to try some of the levels a few times in order to know which step I should make first. While I found the puzzles rather clever and cute, they weren't that challenging. But it does make you think and admire the creativity behind each level. The levels are creative, colorful and funny! Like Angry Birds, Tiny Thief has a three-star score. What's unique about this is that in order to get the three stars, you must:<br /><br />a. complete your goal and proceed towards the door exit without being seen.<br />b. find your adorable pet (ferret). He likes to play peek-a-boo. (Tap on him once you spot him.)<br />c. Find unknown objects.<br /><br />The first thing I zeroed in on was the ferret! I loved trying to spot him! Lemme tell ya, it wasn't easy! Quite a number of times, I was so sure that he wasn't even in the level!<br /><br />Please bear in mind, that you don't need to get all three stars in order to complete the level. If you finish the main mission, then that clears the level. But aah, I can be quite the perfectionist and can become quite determined to get all three stars. LOL. So if you're like me, you won't be zooming through the levels. The hidden objects were so tough! Admittedly, I couldn't find all of them.<br /><br />There is a Book of Hints which surprisingly can only be used once every four hours. The book of hints gives you a step-by-step (pictures) on how to achieve all three stars. I think four hours is a bit too much, but I guess the makers want you to really try and solve it.<br /><br />Overall, I think this game is fun, enjoyable and appeals to all ages. I recommend it!<br /><br />4.5 stars!<br /><br />**I played this on a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I haven't experienced any bugs/glitches.**<br /><br />**EDITED**<br /><br />A reviewer said that this game has ads. Honestly, to my recollection, I haven't experienced any ads throughout my playthrough. I know that ads can be annoying (and I for one really hate ads on any medium). I haven't turned off my wifi/3G.<br /><br />**EDITED 18/10/2013**<br /><br />I quickly played through the first three quests again (I was baffled by the reviewers who said that there are ads in this game) to verifywhether there are any ads or not. Throughout the 15 levels, I have not seen a single ad. Perhaps the Kindle version is different. I bought the app from Google Play and not via Amazon.<br /><br />Another note I would like to make: I disagree with the reviewers who said that this game teaches kids theft. As another reviewer had noted,  Robin Hood is also a thief.  He is a legendary,  iconic character and loved by everyone.  Tiny thief resembles Robin Hood. The poor people in (quest #3 of Tiny Thief ) expressed their joy when he banished a corrupt sherrif. A story is told about Tiny Thief's missions via still pictures. When I was a kid, I loved Robin Hood and still do.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This story is fun ...a great read for the beach. It's a quick little page-turner full of all the twists and blind alleys needed to keep the reader hooked!
B000JMKO0A|5.0|The plots are in no way the same. But the messages of both books are mind-blowing. While the Alchemist & The Pilgrimage tend to mix maybe a bit of fantasy with reality, this one gave a whole lot of sobering reality. I loved it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great product with constant updates that are applicable to my needs. I Really enjoy receiving real time binding updates that reminds that an item is ending soon or relisted or in general an item that may be of interest to me. I like the fact that EBAY does not bombard you with ads. A great app for beginners and advance users!
B00AZREY64|5.0|After I watched the 1st Season, I knew I was going to be Hooked on SOA.  Super writers Great Drama & totally Exciting, series.  You can never Guess what will happen in next show.  Also the Actors are the Best can't ask for more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Didn't see any of it coming - wow.  Loved it.  It's hard to write a good, unpredictable thriller these days.  Great work.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|One of those books you stay up late to finish, full of twists and surprises!  Jodi Picoult at her best!
B0064BWDRW|4.0|Whilst very different authors both Harry Hole and Jack Reacher are awesome heroes.  Jo Nesbo has you going with intelligent plots and intriguing writing. Hardly anything lost in translation.
B007SGM084|3.0|At first wasn't sure if I would be able to read it because it was so trashy. I've never even watched porn but I sure read it. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Haven't seen the movie in awhile thought that I would revisit and glad I did. Excellent for a scifi junkie like myself.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie is easily one of my favorites, and this blu-ray, dvd, digital copy version lets me watch it just about anywhere. Jaime Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio are absolutely amazing in this movie. Don Johnson steals the cake though in my opinion. I never would have imagined he would be so good as a plantation owner, but he gave a phenomenal performance that I consider equal to any of the other actors in the film.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A satisfying and spine-tingling finale to a scary story that needed a definitive ending.  King is the master once again.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Great movie.  Fun, action, effects. Recommended. This movie is a great addition.  Loved the first two as well.  Watch it!

0446547654|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is always a winner. I save few books but have all of his in my collection. He never disappoints.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|it starts out easy but gets much harder as you progress.  As the title indicates, I spend time commuting to and from work and this game really helps pass  the time.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this book. I wondered how the author would ever tie the separate characters together. It had very surprising twists.
B000NIVJGI|3.0|Packaging does not look like true blu-ray casing, cover looks printed in front and on cd. Looks like a cheap fake from Thailand, if it is please advertise that.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I like the Prendergast novels. I have read them all. I hope that in the future more will be written about Alban.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Not as consistently funny as anticipated, but some parts had me<br />Roaring.  Nodded my head frequently, sharing similar perspectives.  Still love Tina!
B00756GRUE|5.0|I own a Omega Automatic Seamaster Professional 300m for about 15 yrs now, of daily use. This is my second watch since. Though it's certainly not a Seamaster tough, it feels good on my wrist. Yeah..., like others not too crazy about the band, feels cheapy....but then again...it's only a 200$ watch..<br />..and also, I dont mind the shiny BLING,<br />it's a change since my Omega is so darned scratched..<br />My first day of it...we'll see how long it can take with my daily abuse of it at work..
