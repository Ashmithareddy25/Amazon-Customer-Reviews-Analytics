B00CBRADU2|1.0|Absolutely horrifying script. The dialog was campy. Peter Stormare's accent was a horrid mix of southern & Swede. Knoxville lived up to his love of all things crazy and Tennessee (The patron state of shootin' stuff).
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you ever wanted to see an adorable teddy bear smoke a bong and curse up a blue streak, here's your chance. McFarlaine's story is purely by the numbers....will Mark Wahlberg grow up? Will girlfriend Mila Kunis dump him if he doesn't? Will Ted come between them? Don't you already know the answer to these? But plot is beside the point in this foul mouthed comedy with several laugh-out-loud moments.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|There are more options on the free I Phone app which was better.  It is ok to play, but I prefer the one with more options.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Burton's best in years, this charming, heartwarming homage to Frankentstein and other monster pics gives you a boy and his {formerly) dead dog to root for. What could be bad about that? This one hits all the right notes. Special appearance by Martin Landau as a misunderstood science teacher.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This DVD was given as a present and it was well received.  The DVD is inserted into the side of a flat screen TV to enjoy while watching or listening to the music all day long.  The haunting and etherial music of &#34;Celtic Woman:  Believe&#34; is one of their best performances, both is song and presentation.  Most enjoyable and excellent in my opinion!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Not as good as first two in series. Really enjoyed the first two, couldn't wait for this one to come out.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Remind me of that Pc game Deablo well put together I give it a 5 star rateing...very easy to play on my kindle and so addictive to play

0807014273|5.0|This book was suggested to me a while ago by my friend Raul. I was having an existential crisis, you see, and I was wondering how to bring meaning to my life.<br /><br />Viktor E. Frankl is a renowned psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, as well as a neuroscientist, who developed a form of therapy called \\"logotherapy\\", or therapy of meaning. This type of therapy is meant to reconcile individuals with the meaning of their lives.<br /><br />But this book isn't read so much for its description of logotherapy as it is for the Frankl's personal account of life in concentration camps during WWII.<br /><br />It's not the first time I have read such accounts. They are all touching, tragic but also infinitely hopeful. Someone survived to tell us the story. Enough of them survived to tell us many stories.<br /><br />Frankl uses his psychological training to analyze the mental state of prisoners through three stages: moving in the camp, living in the camp and life after the camp. The organization of the book is thus not chronological: it is thematic.<br /><br />Through his narrative, Frankl displays the strength of the human heart, the power of love and the importance of meaning in one's life. Indeed, only those who held on to meaning-a family to love, a project to finish, people to change-were able to survive the camps.<br /><br />It's difficult to review this book in a traditional way because it's not a traditional story. It was also read millions of times and translated in dozens of languages. The detached, clinical approach to Holocaust survival is different from other Holocaust memoirs I've read, and yet speaks to the same experiences. And, as every Holocaust story that's ever been published, it highlights the worst of human cruelty and the best of human fortitude.<br /><br />It was a touching story, and yet intellectual at the same time. As you try to grapple with the indescribable human consequences of this darkest of times, Frankl calls on your intellect so you, the reader who didn't live in a camp, can at least rationally grasp the meaning of such an experience.<br /><br />Here's my favourite passage; I'll leave you on this, I think, as it encapsulates the essence of human life:<br /><br />\\"A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth-that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: the salvation of man is through love and in love.\\"who didn't live in a camp, can at least rationally grasp the meaning of such an experience.<br /><br />Here's my favourite passage; I'll leave you on this, I think, as it encapsulates the essence of human life:<br /><br />\\"A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I managed to eat this book up in one sitting. I missed appointments and cancelled dinner with friends. I spent a whole day today immersed in this story. I fell in love with Pat, his mother, Tiffany, and Jake. I am not a fan of the Eagles, but I found myself rooting for them with all my might, right along with Pat. I cried the times Pat prayed. And the times his mother cried hurt my heart. I can't say that it is the best writing I've ever come across. But it is a very good book. It's worth the money to buy it, and the time it takes to read it. I'll be reading it again, slower this time, shortly. I can see myself reading this over and over again. And I'll even watch the movie, which I rarely do.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Compelling story line -- had a hard time putting it down, but then I'm a fan of John Grisham.  I look forward to the sequel.
014241493X|5.0|I'm a huge John Green fan, and this is hands down my favorite book of his. No, it didn't rip my heart out of my chest and stomp all over it like TFIOS and Looking For Alaska did. But it's amazing. I was hooked from the second I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. It was intriguing and suspenseful, and it was so exciting to read. Definitely a great book.
B008DW6VOQ|2.0|There was a place to enter price paid for your stock, but I couldn't find a way to make it work.  It had a way to set up different style charts, but it didn't say how to do it.  So, in my opinion, this app is useless for anything other than keeping track of daily prices for your portfolio.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great need more investment credit to build places so I'm doing the review good game enjoyable something to play on long journeys
B006MW3UZW|5.0|THIS SHOW WAS INTRODUCED TO ME FROM A COWORKER, I WAS HOOKED AFTER THE FIRST EPISODE. ONLY WATCH IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TO WATCH THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Kinda dumb. I lost all my stuff and it made me cry. I think eden is better still. You<br />can have all the stuff you want and it never gets lost.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Lost Girl is a fantastic show coming from Canada. I highly Recommend giving this show a try, you won't regret it.  And for the fans of the show, I would definitely go with blu ray over DVD...
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Great album, many good songs. Have it on my running playlist. The one click purchase to cloud was easy and fast.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|My wife loves it ....it is just OK with me.  My favorites are when he covers the old ballads like in some of his older CD's
B00181YT9S|1.0|Just ordered and received these speakers. Was uninformed that the power cord was a European outlet plug so was unable to use it. Think Amazon should do better with there descriptions.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I originally purchased it because of the Outlook.com commercials, featuring &#34;Can't Hold Us&#34; and the Colbert Report episode where they played &#34;Same Love&#34;.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I enjoyed the entire album.  My favorite song on it is &#34;Wing$&#34;, but the other songs also have great beats and lyrics.  I'm quite pleased with this album!
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|This book allows to develop a business strategy a quick and objective way. As Henry Mintzberg said in The Fall and Rise of Strategic  Planning.<br />The only problem on reading this book was the lack of page number of Kindle, it is a pain in the neck.
1451695195|5.0|A wonderful book that opens one's mind to the possibilities of heaven. Being a neurologist wrote it, I am most impressed. Gave me a wonderful feeling and is a book not to be missed by anyone.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This was a new artist to me but I ordered the CD anyway to try something new.  I was NOT disappointed.  It is a great album by an excellent performer and I'm enjoying adding it to my listening list.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Uncanny! The philosophy of the 21st century.  Who is really the &#34;bad guy&#34;? Besides, all actors are just fantastic!  I watched it several times, but can't have enough of it!
B00A6TYCNQ|1.0|I bought this following other reviews and the video advertised in the AppStore thinking \\"wow, looks good, plays smooth, a good action game fix\\" unfortunately it runs like complete crap on my kindle fire HD. Choppy, almost unplayable. Same with NOVA 3. Do yourself a favor, stay away from Gameloft. They can't seem to streamline games for the devices they sell games on. I for one, will never buy or download anything from gameloft after this.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|The first season was original, but the second season seems rather forced, not quite flowing.  It has become as redgular soap opera...
B000P0J024|5.0|Disc 1 (the original) is my favorite, although the DVD is pretty awesome too. I would recommend it to anyone
B00068TJM6|5.0|Purchased this watch earlier this month. Arrived on time.<br />The watch is stunning. The other setllar reviews of this watch are right on. Everything moves cleanly and the domes hardlex crystal is cool.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Not the ending I anticipated....am glad about that.  I have read other reviews and am confused as to why they were so upset with the final conclusion.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I thought I wouldn't like the &#34;new&#34; doctors and their 'new' companions,but every time the dr changes, something happens in the story to endear (or at least establish a strong connection between) the dr to/and the audience.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not sure what to say. I guess that I wanted other ending. At least this time she didn't over explain each character and past situation.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I thought I wouldn't like the &#34;new&#34; doctors and their 'new' companions,but every time the dr changes, something happens in the story to endear (or at least establish a strong connection between) the dr to/and the audience.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A very enjoyable read. A book that covered very serious issues particularity those with disabilities but also a good smattering of humour throughout. My only criticism would be the ending of the story. I felt that it lacked the emotion that had been so evident in the rest of the story.
B000059GEI|2.0|Ethel Merman never \\"made\\" it in film.<br /><br />She screeches to the balcony in her numbers and her face and body movements tell us that HEY I'M HERE AND GET OUTTA MY WAY.<br /><br />It's a crappy film.<br /><br />I have never understood the folks that claim Marilyn Monroe was under-rated/over-rated/brilliant/misunderstood.  I find her a gorgeous woman with minimal (I'm being kind), talent.  Without her looks, she would be Darla from the \\"Our Gang\\" shorts, only all grown up.<br /><br />Merman is Merman.  A bland, loud note.<br /><br />Not a great musical by any stretch of the vocal chords.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. It was well written and I couldn't put it down. A must read. Great for book clubs.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Quentin at his best.  Lots of blood so if that's not your thing you may not enjoy this movie.  Great acting.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It's ok. It's a girl flick and it was entertaining for most of the movie. The actress is pretty and eye candy for the guys watching.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|This track was lots of fun. The songs varies greatly and a lot were recognizable from the games background ambience. Portal's theme reeked throughout these tracks and overall it was very enjoyable.<br />Along with it came a redeemable code for an in-game item for TF2 called the &#34;Ap-Sap.&#34;<br />This item was very entertaining as it talks to you in the most unlikely of situations and most of the time it can be very humorous.<br />All-in-all, I loved ordering this entire package. The soundtrack was worth it along with the extras. I highly suggest it!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This show is amazing from beginning to end.<br />excellent sound and crowd participation<br />for the price its a must for any RHCP fan<br />The collection of songs is mostly from By The Way and Californication with a good mix of their bigger hits<br />also. it arrived precisely when it was supposed to
B00AIJP9BS|3.0|At first I thought this was a great game, but then I tried a match. The matches are two player which could be what you want but I found them to be very boring!

0857680986|5.0|If you want to have an art instructor in a book, Loomis is the one. NO ONE is better at pure drawing instruction that this man.<br />Not suitable for the young aspiring artist under 16, but it your artist is more mature, then the 'nudes' will not be an issue.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game. really fun in how the game works and how it is played. is a little slow with the continuing on of the game if you dont buy anything
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Do not be fooled by the &#34;Original&#34; in the description. THESE are Lucas enhanced! NOT the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES!<br />I still wanted for the Blu-Ray, but Disney needs to release the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES, clean. Take out dust, scratches, and fix color issues. I will only give FIVE stars when that happens...
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This is the best Star Wars game I've played since Tie Fighter for the PC. And it's the best video pinball game I've ever played! I'm totally hooked!

B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris knows her characters.  She knows them intimately, and far better than those readers who project their own wishes and feelings upon them.  She wanted to bring a humanity and complexity into urban fantasy, and she has done so consistently and well through the brave but wounded Sookie Stackhouse.  It is obvious to anyone reading the previous twelve books that she has planned for this ending, and it has come out as it should.<br />It is a challenge wrapping up an epic of this complexity, that spans not only geography, but history and politics through the secret world of the supernaturals -- indeed, through the several different cultures of different supernatural creatures.  Harris came up with a consistent morality, culture, and practice for vampires, the fae, and several types of shape shifters, and threaded Sookie and her friends and lovers through them.  It's astonishing that after this much time and complexity that she can wrap it up, but she did, resolving open issues, tying up loose ends, and showing how Sookie could live happily -- but realistically -- ever after.<br />Harris understands the importance of constraints; one of the challenges of urban fantasy series is that they tend to mushroom out of control.  Sookie had her moments of greatness, but they were HUMAN moments.  She never became a Mary Sue, with everyone in the world groveling at her feet for no apparent reason; nor did she gain epic and unprecedented power -- even her own abilities developed from the first book only in incremental, believable ways.  This is what makes Sookie Stackhouse so satisfying, and so real: she struggles to keep her house clean, she worries about her finances, she forgets to check her messages, but she shows human greatness and determination in the face of bizarre and superpowered creatures that surround her and try to lure her into other worlds that she rejects.  Her telepathy makes her more human, not less, because even more than telepathic she is empathic: she herself represents the human emotions that the vampires lack in their cold politicking; and the complex thinking that the weres lack in their primal urges.  She is complex, and therefore she is human.<br />Harris is a brave writer on several counts: first, that she will end a series no matter how successful, because it is the right thing to do; second, that she will hurt her character as needed for the sake of the story -- traits she shares with people like J. K. Rowling; and third, she will create the ending she intends for her characters regardless of what anyone else thinks: the mark of an artist with integrity.  She knew Sookie's ending for sure from her second book, and, indeed, the signs are there from the first if you know where to look.<br />She did what she set out to do, with a sure command of her story and her characters.  Some may not like the choices she (and Sookie) made, and that is the privilege any reader has.  But they cannot claim she made the WRONG choices, because that is simply not possible here. The many wonderful personalities in this epic are now and forever Harris' characters, and we would not have them without her sure eye and deft hand.  There is no question in my mind that the end of this series is right, and true, and brave -- just as Sookie was, and is.  She gets it from her creator.she herself represents the human emotions that the vampires lack in their cold politicking; and the complex thinking that the weres lack in their primal urges.

B008602KQI|3.0|Watching the movie after having read the book, it was missing too much. I never really felt for any character in the movie, it was all too rushed and more like a summary.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best serials I have ever seen.<br />Since you need more words here they are, is that ok.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Grandson asked to download this came and he is enjoying it.<br /><br />He is almost 6 and a wiz on this sort of thing.<br /><br />Great graphics.

Although they still don't show in the cloud when sync is used.<br /><br />Have used Kindle reader on All my devices including this one without issue until this latest build.<br /><br />Would like to see last format returned.<br /><br />Cloud access issue seems fixed.

B005DD7H50|4.0|While it isn't scientifically accurate. (The whole point being using 100% of your brain at a time, which would be called a seizure) The movie does have an interesting plot.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Great movie to show what it was like to grow up back in the 50's/60's. To show the cliques as they were known T-birds and Pink Ladies, sure don't see them around anymore...
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a really fun game. The new hero's you can get are expensive so it will keep you playing. Another fun feature is the ability to create your own guild. You can promote members and unlock new abilities like to get 10% more coins. Get it before they start charging you for it!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Free good game worth the extra 500 mbps space. Only thing is stage is the same with different obstacles. Need more maps
0880796863|5.0|I lov this Deck, it's simple and perfect. The quality is great and it comes with great orientations on how to play the cards. I suggest the buyer to increment their studies with other tarot guides as well.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This group is phenomenal and highly recommended, it's almost crazy to think of a debut album being as good as this one actually is.  They can only get better which is scary in a good way.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great takes lots of time. but it is worth the time great for stragety players. I liked it quiet a bit.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Without Juliana, this show would be another hackneyed Boston Legal, The Practice, etc.  The story lines are simplistic and full of absurd courtroom antics.  Lawyers must cringe when they watch this.  But Juliana steals the show.  You can't help rooting for her, feeling her pain, and therefore, I find myself following the story no matter how silly or contrived it may be.<br /><br />Though Juliana's character, Alicia, has many ups and downs in this show, I always end up feeling good after watching it.  Her essentially honesty and compassion may cause her grief at times, but in the end, good generally wins out.<br /><br />This show definitely falls under the category of a guilty pleasure, the kind you hate to admit you like, but you just can't help yourself.
B004H4XLRE|1.0|The pictures look fantastic but you wouln belive the desapoinment of my son when he saw that only 1 out of the more than 20 cars on the pictures were included.....also i could not find a set  of cars to buy separetly eithet....

B004R13U6Y|4.0|I needed an app for my friend's 7\\" Kindle Fire, comparable to PDF Expert (Apple). It suffices, however, the navigation features are too cluttered and small to read and access.<br /><br />Also, when making a selection for emphasis, the dragging feature is not user-friendly.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I am very happy with this latest CD by Alicia Keys! She looks and sounds beautiful. She is a woman who has continued to grow in her music and personal like, and it shows in the content of her music. Also a great collaboration with Maxwell!

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Basic and simple application. User-friendly. I prefer this program over ezPDF Reader, especially, when it comes to placing emphasis on words and phrases.  An excellent program for beginners. Not too busy or overly cluttered with non-essentials.

B00000DCHI|5.0|This is a nice compilation but how come the song \\"Honesty\\" is not included but it's included in my older copy of this album?<br />But even that song it's not included here in this release, it's still ok, because the song \\"Just the way you are\\" is the full album version, before in my older copy they edited it.<br />Also the song \\"sometimes a fantasy\\" how come that song is not included, even the previous released of this album, it's not included.

B00003CXRM|4.0|This is a movie I purchased as a used copy since it is cheaper than renting. It's a great movie and makes me laugh every time. Unfortunately, the sound is not great and I should have got the Blu-ray edition for the sound. I'm hard of hearing, though when my wife and I watched it together, I noticed she was having trouble with the dialog clarity also. Though I'm not a country or blue grass fan, I still enjoy the music in this movie. I highly recommend the movie, but get the one with better sound.
B000I5X824|4.0|just a collector of old cd's like it, just a art of my over 500 collection as with all cd's the music is great

B000JML90Y|5.0|When you read this book, it becomes immediately obvious that most of its critics have never done so, relying instead on quote mining by religiously motivated deniers.  Darwin methodically and truthfully outlines 20 years of painstaking evidence collection, and why it led him to his conclusions.  He was also honest enough to point out the gaps in the evidence and the concerns he had with his theory as at 1860.  A classic of science.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great book!  Read it based on feedback and because I heard there was a movie coming out. Not something I'd get invested in for the whole series though.
0783219598|5.0|Good quality and the movie just can't be any better, loved it! Just goes to show you that a movie rated G can keep even an adults attention. We will be watching this one over and over again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love this series. Such a great book and always about five twists that keep you flipping the pages. Can´t wait for the next one
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris never disappoints!  As usual, I can't wait to see what happens next!  Keep up the good work, your books make me happy! :)
B001L28KHG|5.0|One of his best, Petty is an American musical icon who's gifts we all can enjoy! His body of work is a huge trove of classic treasures.
B00BFPX132|5.0|Sodom, one of the veteran thrash metal acts of the 80s has continued to blaze a path of metal for over 30 years. Epitome of Torture is a great release and in my opinion, tops In War And Pieces. Tom's voice is killer as always. On this album, we see a glimpse of the past (vocal wise) with the brutality heard on Tapping The Vein, and M-16. \\"My Final Bullet\\" starts off this juggernaut of an album. The riffs are catchy, and the chorus is something to sing along. You will find yourself yelling \\"THIS IS MY FINAL BULLET!!\\" \\"S.O.D.O.M.\\" is a good track, but the use of \\"s o d o m\\" gets a little old. However, the vocals are a little distorted and that adds a great feel to this track. Oh yeah, BEWARE OF THE SOLO. Its deadly. \\"Epiome Of Torture\\" Vocals are darker. The riff is simple, but the drumming department is top notch. \\"Stigmatized\\" Now we have a throw back to Tapping The Vein on this track. The vocals are just as brutal as Sodom's 1992 release. I will say that lyrically this track is sort of boring. But the solo is captivating. \\"Cannibal\\" has a nice intro and a great beat will have you banging your head for the whole 4:19. This is perhaps one of the highlights off the album. \\"Shoot Today-Kill Tomorrow\\" another intense showing by Mr. Angelripper. The double bass in this track is addicting, just for fair warning. \\"Invoking The Demons\\" a simple, yet effective bass intro will spark the listener's intrest. The double bass will thunder causing your ear drums to bleed. Then the intro solo kicks in! And to make things better, you release, Tom Angelripper is still on vocals! This is another great track. \\"Katjuscha\\" has a nice melodic intro, reminds me of Violent Revoultion era Kreator. The solo shreds as expected. \\"Into The Skies Of War\\" a simple intro, simple drumming, but then it gets incredibly catchy. The lyrics are great, a throwback to classic Sodom. Incredibly melodic for these guys. \\"Tracing The Victim\\" closes this amazing album. Very tight drumming and guitar work will keep you hooked. Tom's yells are just as good as they were at the beginning of the album. The closing solo will blow you away and have you waiting for the next album! It is excellent.<br /><br />Overall, like the title says, DO NOT DRIVE TO THIS. You will headbang constantly freaking out your girlfriend, run over small animals, and probably wreck. Another thing I would like to add, I LOVE the throwback to Kreator's Pleasure To Kill here with the album cover. Epitome Of Torture is a must have for any fan of metal. The fact that this Teutonic Thrash Trio can release an album of this calibur after all these years is truly amazing. Epitome Of Torture is already on my list for best metal album of 2013, while the year is still young, it could be the year of Germany's Sodom.eep you hooked.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Dont want to tell anyone how to raise their kids, but best advice I can give is know that it's a rally fun but violent movie that you should watch before you decide if your kids can see it. Just saying that because a lot of people have asked me that, to which I've responded &#34;It's a Quentin Tarantino film&#34;. Nuff said.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This Back pack Fits 2 cameras, 4 lens, 2 chargers, camera & lens caps, and a camera guide comfortably. Very durable construction, very pleased with this purchase.
B000IZ21BS|5.0|cheesy! not scary! funnny! awesome! creepy! weird! bad language! It was the first horror movie I have ever seen ( and my first R rated movie). Kids get permission from parent/guardian before watching.😄
B007HACDLK|5.0|love reading these books by vince flynn.  it has your hero mitch rapp who is a no nonsence cia guy.  also i like how the story raps around current history of afgan and the middle east.  to be truthful we could use a hero like this today in real history.
B00C1C0WCQ|4.0|great fx but the hole adventure & story wasn't as good as the first one I bet youll enjoy! So watch that movie!😃
B00BC24NT4|4.0|The plot is absurd.  The characters are stock figures out of central casting and absurd even on their own terms.  Forget if you agree with the author's quite obvious views on America, GWOT, New Labor, the Deep State etc.  He has ridden similar hobby horses before and simply done a better job of it.  That said, through pacing, an exquisite sense of place [he makes each setting come alive] and his usual genius for dialog, he makes a fun read.  Sadly not fun enough that I do not somewhat regret paying full price for an HC.  With hindsight, I should have waited for my local library to get a copy.  However, Hollywood will love making this movie as it does wonderfully nasty sendups of black ops, the W years and evangelical millionaire neocons.
0061122416|5.0|The book has so much truth. I recommend it to everyone. Especially if you're feeling down in the dumps and looking for some meaning to life. This is the book! (:
B004JZBGWI|5.0|As a student, this application is easy to get to and is simple to use. I can make quick lists.This works great for the calander. During reading assignments and lectures, I can make a quick note and than put into the archive. Later, I can go back to the archive and retrieve the note and apply it to a research paper. I put my kindle next to my laptop while typing, finding information is easier and faster than searching through stacks of legal pads. This has saved me lots of time in writing papers. Great product, keep up the good work.

0307236722|5.0|\\"Baking Handbook\\" A Collection of Favorite Baking Recipes by Martha Stewart with over 200 Foolproof Recipes, from Simple Baked Goods, Cookies, Cakes, Pies, Tarts, Cobblers, Crisps, to Yeasted Baked Goods, Pastries and even a Chapter on Basic Recipes which covers Frosting and Glazes, Fillings, Custards and Creams, Toppings and Dough. All her Recipes have their own Beautiful Photograph with even Step-by-Step Pictures so common of Martha's Books, that's why they are the Best, I love to Collect Them and Learn from Them. The Full Color Photographs are Awesome and they Entice you and Lure you to make all the Wonderful Bake Good Recipes, not only that, each Recipe's Picture represents the Final Product showing you how that Cake or Cookie should look like, Tempting you to make them just like That<br /><br />And so I did, I like making Martha's Cakes I have Baked many of them through the years. One thing I like to do is to cut down on the amount of Butter and Sugar that She uses in her cakes, this is my personal taste, I made Martha's Birthday Cake with few changes I did not use the 4 Sticks, 1 Pound of Butter the Recipe calls for, I used less than half that amount and even with all the Tweaking sometimes I do in her Recipes, the Cakes come out looking Great and with that Professional Look. I have watched The Martha Stewart Show for years when She was on Network Television and I used to Tape many of her Recipes from the Show, all the many Wonderful Desserts She used to Create. Martha has and Eye for Detail and that can be seen on all her Recipes, they are easy to follow and understand with Simple Instructions<br /><br />Martha Stewart's \\"Baking Handbook\\" has many Savory Pies and Tarts, I had made the \\"Tomato Tart\\" and also \\"Sausage and Feta Hand Pies\\" which are very Good and they are some of my Favorites. Other contents in the Baking Handbook are: \\"General Baking Equipment\\" Martha Lists all the Utensils in Detailed needed to Create her Desserts and with a Description of eachone of them and of course...with Pictures. \\"General Baking Techniques\\" with many Explanations, Suggestions and Pointers and...Step-by-Step Pictures. I like the Chapter called \\"Simple Baked Goods\\" with many Simple Recipes and Ingredients that you probably all ready have in your Pantry to make \\"Biscuits\\" \\"Muffins\\" \\"Banana-Nut Bread\\" \\"Corn Bread\\" \\"Scones\\" \\"Pound Cakes\\" and so many others. Martha Stewart's \\"Baking Handbook\\" is the Ultimate Assistance in Baking, as She wrote and I Quote \\"Baking offers Comfort and Joy and something tangible to Taste and Savor\\" ...I think She is Right, I am glad I have the \\"Baking Handbook\\" ...Thank You D.D.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Inspiring story about a hard-working and talented musician and song writer who overcame many obstacles to triumph in the end in his own unique way.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin Timberlake's new CD The 20/20 Experience  gives a great computation of slow R & B music and I liked it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|While sad that RJ didn't live to see his epic finished, Sanderson was a great choice to finish the books. All of his works are well thought out and satisfying.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A very addicting game with new backgrounds and characters. It's a good game to pass the time with. Great free game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Im  like this game because it has me on the edge of my seat. I also like it because its a vry different experience every time I play. That's why I like subway sitters.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought the acting was great, and the whole concept very interesting artistically.<br />I hated the weird styles of the general population, but began to enjoy them after a bit.  The whole sacrificial premise was revolting, but hey,it works in mainstream religion.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Good audio quality, long cable, and connects to a DSLR camera with ease. Only drawbacks are that its a condenser (requires battery), and the clip is a little cheap. But, then again, so is the microphone, and that's the point!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I don't understand why people are complaining about the font pack... it is included in the office suite for me so I got no complaint and this app works great!
B004GXKBEM|5.0|Well developed characters, great themes, and excellent picture quality. Every stop-motion lover should have this in their library, and in Blu-ray if possible.
B0000844M8|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out. Even though I know the movie it makes me cry tears of joy every single time! This movie got me interested in Lions and they are my favorite of the big cats!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love everything about it.....the size, the ease of use, every calculation I would ever need and the fact that it &#34;remembers and highlights&#34; your calculations as using.  Well worth $.99.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|I love this movie even if it is a remake. I love all the effects and all the action in the movie. Keeps you entertained from the beginning to the end. You will not be disappointed if you like action movies and this one is for you. Or even if you only like movies of King Kong. This will be great for your collection.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show and have Season 1-4 DVDs. I caught up and needed to get my fix so I bought season 5 on Amazon. This show does not disappoint. Terrific writing and acting keep me coming back for more.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Love the movie of the Terminator 2. I love it that it came out on bluray.. This is great to add to the Terminator series.
0307730697|5.0|God bless Adam Brown and his family this was such a great book, so well done glad I read it.
B001FB55I0|5.0|This is another movie to the series and love this movie as well. I love it that it is on bluray.. I love all the terminator movies and great to add to your collection.
193700788X|1.0|I have to agree Sam, that is pretty convoluted. I never thought Ms. Harris was a top notch writer, but her characters and stories were interesting in the beginning. Then, about 4 books ago, I began to feel as if she was not trying any longer. With the final book in the series I do not think she tried at all. I had this pre-ordered even though I have been very disappointed with the last few. I was hoping, really, really hoping, that she was saving all the good stuff for the last book. How wrong I was. I am utterly miffed. I loved Sookie and Eric and Sam in the earlier books. I am not even upset who Sookie ended up with, just how little effort was put into the beginning or ending of relationships. How characters did nonsensical things. How juvenile the writing seemed at this point. I expecting the writing to mature with each book, not degenerate. I, like many other readers, feel cheated and devalued. It is as if towards the end it was all about making a buck or a deadline and not quality of the product. I am angry Sookie's tale ended in such a way and feel sad and cheated.<br /><br />Just wanted to add that this is the first time in history I requested a refund for a book. Yes it was that bad.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The Wizard of Oz is one of my most favorite movies! Reading the stories is very interesting. I look forward to the rest.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|This is an interesting concept and very thought provoking.  I thought they could have developed Emily Blunt's character a little more, but that being said, the movie moved at a fairly good speed and kept me entertained.  There are some real good questions about life, free will, chance, and how much say we have in our own decisions.  Matt Damon's performance is solid, not great, but solid.  It was a good movie and I would recommend it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Scary amounts of sounds flooding into my ears from every direction. Nice base, good noise blocking, very comfortable, 10hr charge, wireless with awesome range and mic has crystal clear clarity. Never owned a good pair of gaming headphones before and let me tell you it's a game changer. Man everything about this product is sweet!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I thought it was a good movie, however, somewhat predictable.  I waited a while to see it.  As it turns out, too long, as I saw it after the Oscars.  Unfortunately, the awards show should have come with a &#34;spoiler alert.&#34;  I think had I not seen the most pivotal part of the movie on the Oscars, I might have given the movie 4 stars (or at least 3.5).  It was entertaining.  Denzel's performance was good, not his best, but Denzel will never give a bad performance.  If you haven't seen it and haven't been &#34;spoiled,&#34; I would recommend it.  You will be entertained.
0988262592|5.0|The parallels with my own professional life and those of the main character were surprising and a little worrying,<br />and the progression through the problems faced by the main character and thier solutions should be applicable to anyone who writes software or supports IT infrastructure.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The acting?  Great!  Cinematography?  Great!  Historical relevance?  Great!  Costume design?  Great!  Movie?  Boring.  I watched this movie with great interest, because historically, this was such an amazing time in American history.  However, I thought the movie moved along at a very slow pace.  It took a while for my ear to get tuned into the &#34;language&#34; of the movie and I am sure I missed some things in translation.  From a historical perspective, I think this is a great movie, a wonderful period piece.  However, I had to WORK to get through it.  That is not my idea of a great movie experience.  I am glad I saw it, but will only be seeing it one time.  It will be a wonderful movie for US History classes of the future, but I doubt many will be watching it for it's entertainment value.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|I thought a 1949 movie would be dated and no longer relevant, but I was wrong. The characters in this movie have a message for us all. The young woman who wants complete freedom and can't stand any attachments. The self made businessman who chose the wrong way to wealth and power. The ruthless man who wanted to build his power by manipulating others. The older man who fought the good fight, but gave up at the end. The hero who would be true to himself no matter what. I thought the characters too simple and the dialogue contrived at first. Then I realized I may not have gotten the message if Ayn Rand had been more subtle. This movie shows a person's independent thinking and self esteem are what make a person whole and mankind great.I decided to watch this movie because I loved \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" by Ayn Rand.
B00B935SUY|5.0|If you are into rock music history, you will absolutely love this movie.  If you aren't into the ins and outs of the business it might not be for you.  There are some cool tidbits of legends playing together and nice soundbites that might keep the average fan interested, but this movie really speaks to the music nerd.  This movie was made for the guy who sat at home on friday nights reading the liner notes of his albums with his headphones on instead of going to backyard beer bashes.  This is the movie for people who know producers by name, AND who they produced!  Sound City is legendary.  It's about time someone recognized it for what it will always be...musical heaven.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It has such a fantastic plot and keeps you on reading until you finish the book and want more. The story line is somewhat outhere but yet it relates to so many similar situations in real life. Suzanne Collins keep up the great work!
B00BF11STU|2.0|I watched this movie because it had great reviews and was up for so many awards.  There is the historical component, too, which got me interested.  To be honest, I found 3/4 of the movie completely boring.  I fell asleep twice and  had to go back and &#34;re-watch&#34; the parts I slept through.  I got through it out of respect for the story, however, I don't feel it was told in a very compelling way.  That being said, I don't know if could have been told much differently.  I am not sure if I found it dull because I already knew the story, or if it was because the movie moved along at such a snail's pace.  I suspect a little of both.  I understand they were trying to make the movie &#34;haunting&#34; and &#34;gritty.&#34;  It just didn't work for me.
B007XGJK4G|4.0|A very informative documentary,I'm sixty-six and I missed him.His last concert at Pittsburg,Pa was just fifty miles away.I think I known a lot more about him now.
B00BDPW7XE|5.0|If you like your prog sort of mellow, but well constructed with enough twists to keep it interesting, this is for you.  One of the best I have heard this year, and overall, a notch above Part 1 in my estimation.  I love the particular blend of instruments these guys achieve.  Solid guitar and piano, some folksy banjo strums or whatever, horns or strings when needed, and solid NDV percussion. This group is autobuy for me.
B00AZKCU7G|3.0|I want to start off by saying that my husband and I both thought this was an exceptional movie and deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />Now, this Blu-ray/DVD/digital combo is a different story. I wanted a DVD that had the most possible special features, because our favorite part of owning a DVD (vs. just downloading a movie) is being able to watch all the special features.<br /><br />I ordered this set thinking it would be packed with special features, and it is... but they're all in Blu-ray format. So if you're like us and don't own a Blu-ray player yet, be aware of this, especially if you're hoping for some great special features. There is only one \\"featurette\\" type thing in DVD format, and it was interesting, but it pales in comparison to the exciting list of Blu-ray special features we aren't able to watch.<br /><br />That being said, we are still huge fans of this movie and of Amazon. I ordered this for my husband's birthday and somehow botched the address for delivery, so UPS couldn't deliver it and had to send it back. I would have to reorder the item, and it was going to be well after the original ship date when I received it. Amazon customer service gladly took care of the reorder with me on the phone AND gave me a free upgrade to overnight shipping. I received my item the next day and my husband was surprised and excited when he got his gift. Well done, Amazon.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Good, relatively mindless fun at the end of the day for me, as I trade off pictures with my distant daughter.  Nice to have that mystery picture waiting for me every day.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|What an awesome movie! Read the books and its awesome that the screen writer stuck so close to the book. Can't wait for the second movie!
B007L96SI6|5.0|Excellent cd I'd buy Haley's every time her voice is amazing and the world is lucky to have found her talent!
0920668364|5.0|Seriously, everytime I read this I cry. Got for a friend and her new baby. Crying all around. But its a lovely book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|We want more please. I really did not want to stop. Hope you guys come out with more of the room.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|One of the best films ever mad, pushes the boundaries of multiple film styles seamlessly tying them together to paint a metaphors of subtlety. A must see without reservation.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Cool ( this book hates you so don't read it or else you will die and every thing in this book will happen and u  don't want that)
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Very good movie. Liked the acting and the storyline  kind of gives you a different look at mental illness and how it affects people
B005DD7H50|5.0|In some ways, this move is similar to the movie Contagion where it provides a entirely plausible scenario to an incredibly unlikely biological aberration. Like the book Flowers for Algernon, Limitless provides a window into the theoretical limits of our own brain power.  What would it mean if the average person could take a pill that would allow he/she to harness every neuron.  Pretty eye opening.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very very addictive game ...I absolutely lovee this game and be up all night trying to beat me high score
B000EWD1KK|3.0|I was soooo looking forward to recieving this movie.  I was heart broken when it arrived scratched because the disc was sliding around inside the case.  It was skipping and rather unbearable, but part way through it smoothed out and I was able to watch the end.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|good game just kind of frustrated at the second level the trick is to stay by Sanders still good game just tricky
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this book based on a suggestion from a friend and I'm sure glad that I did.  I want more, more, more!!!!
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|QuestLord is an exploration RPG.  Pick a class - Human, Elf, Dwarf - and try to save the Kingdom.  But initially you don't know what exactly you're doing.  If you talk to enough characters and interact with enough items, the game opens up a lot.  And it's a HUGE game.  But with lots of quests - like 18 or so - and each one is understandable.  There are some puzzles, and at one point it took me an extremely long time to find a necessary item - which I knew was necessary from what some of the characters told me.<br /><br />One thing that would have made the game start smoother for me is, touch things.  That's how you examine, read or activate.<br /><br />The game is deep - lots of content - and as you progress some of the adversaries are quite challenging, but death is just another gateway.<br /><br />The style is old Commodore 64.  Not fancy graphics, very retro but very playable.  I probably got 40 hours of play time just as one character type.  Really top notch experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I think that Colleen is one of the few writers that I've read lately that makes me drool for the next book in the series.  I cannot wait until the next book comes out.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|If you're not already a fan of King and his writing (I am not), skip part one. It's laborious and extremely self-impressed biography. I'm sure that to him it all has something to do with how he became a writer, but the point was lost on me. Part 2, though, which is actually, y'know, &#34;on writing,&#34; is gold. And part 3, a much more detailed and recent-memory biographical bit, is a great read. I'd highly recommend this book, but wouldn't have missed a thing if I'd just started on part 2.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|So much f UN. Hard to quit.<br />Levels are a great challenge.<br />I keep going back to it  every chance I get. Gotta try it!
B0057R5G6E|5.0|If you like Jurassic Park you should buy this, simple as that. Only downside being that the digital copies included expired in December 2012 so you can't use them. Other than that, it's a simple choice, you either buy and be awesome or you don't buy and not be awesome....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very addictive,cute,fun to play. Love to rearrange my village. Creating all the families and arranging all the fun activities is fun. I love trying to tap scrat as her runs across ur screen.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|I've been a fan of Bowie for ever.  His ever changing explorations always intrigue me.  First record in 10 years... The Next day has a up sounding pop tone with some often retrospective lyrics.  As is often the case with Bowie, I find myself listening very carefully to lryics... he is always interesting.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Third Star is a great film with a great cast that brings real felling to the roles they portray. This film made me both laugh cry and feel for the characters and there pain.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Had to get it after watching Castle, the TV series. it has been fun to watch, a combination of star trek and Bonanza!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The only people whom I've spoken with that didn't like this movie, are those who had never seen the play.  Otherwise the acting is good, and the singing is as well.... Especially when you consider that it was sung as it was recorded, and not in the studio and dubbed in.  To me, it was excellent.  But I've seen the play several times in London and Broadway.  I'm delighted to have it on DVD where I can watch it whenever I want!  What a beautiful story!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Hard to put down, through Shin's story the author provides incredible insight into the horrors of life in a North Korean prison camp. A book like this really puts life into perspective.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Hilarious and heartwarming!  A wonderful movie!  A pleasure to watch!  Excellent acting.  A great story based on reality.  Very good!
B0060AY85C|3.0|Toni Morrison's style of writing is not one that I find easy to read, as I like a story that is continuous with characters and flows.  I find it distracting to remember which character I am reading about now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome. Me and my sister are addicted to this game. I love it,  and it occupies is<br />. Me and her are tryong to get throuh it,  still
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved the twist ending. This story was heartwrenchingly beautiful in its simplicity. The hope, redemption and the painstaking task of coming to terms with the past brought me to tears.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|While not AS spectacular as the first Farseer trilogy, this book is wonderful and has truly been an enjoyable read. Hobb has allowed is to revisit some of our favorite characters with her usual great writing, and I'm excited to see what's next in the tawny man trilogy.<br /><br />I will say however, that there are slow, overly detailed moments (Robert Jordan-ish, but not nearly reaching his level), but I find that I enjoy her writing, so I am generally okay with this. The book doesn't seem to move as quickly as some of her others.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Decent one time watch. The story is ok, some scenes are really funny. I had better expectations, and expected the movie to be funnier. But its the right blend of drama, comedy and emotions.
B009R659L8|5.0|The book had several parallel mysteries going on at once. There was nothing to indicate how the book was going to evolve, with several twists in the plot.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to be surprised with the ending.<br />If you like James Patterson, You will like Mary Higgins Clark.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|hack and smash demons for hours upon hours. good times.)<br />I hope you give it a chabce. warning you may have to spend some real cash to go quickly but 10 bucks isn't a big deal.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Gives you a much better understanding of the Middle East and what goes on there. Love the sarcastic humor that DeMille writes with.

B009YP9L7U|1.0|I'm sorry but I couldn't like the heroine at all. She couldn't make up her own mind and was totally irritating.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I just finished Dead Ever After and I'm feeling like I really didn't know Sookie at all. My heart is broken since I was reading these books from the beginning, when I joined a book club in my apartment complex at the time. There I have many days/nights/late nights reading about Sookie's life. I felt like I was going though every good or bad experience with Sookie. I would re-read the WHOLE series to be fresh for the new book. My copy of Dead to the World (my fave) starting falling apart and I had to get another copy. That being said............<br /><br />Dead Ever After didn't fit into the series at all for me. Sookie was not the same at all, she sounded weak, racist (that scene with Tara), and uncaring. I loved Bill and Eric who wasn't really in the book. I understand that Sam would probably be the choose for her since she did want to be married with children, however I just wish there was more build up to that end. To me, Sam as always been just a friend. I find it odd that Sookie was working with Sam for five years before the series started, so why not just make the series about Sookie coming together with Sam, when that's what the author said she was going to do since the 2 book. I just feel like the author stoled $280 from me, if she could have ended the series in about 5 books if the end was Sookie being with Sam. I just don't understand. The final book just felt like the author was over the whole series and really didn't care about her creations anymore. I didn't get the plot or the 3rd person scenes giving a way the villans.<br /><br />This is just my two cents, I'm sorry Charlaine is getting death wishes (that's just silly) but I'm also sorry that this was the last book and she totally tainted the series with it. I will still keep all of my books but it will be awhile before I can read any of them again as I would often do. And when I finally do I'm stoping after Dead and Gone, I think.<br /><br />Catherine ( was die hard Sookie and Charlaine fan)

B00005MP58|2.0|This miniseries is the best rendition of this classic story that ever was.  Colin Firth is absolutely perfect in the role of Mr. Darcy.  Jennifer Ehle is equally superb.  The series is so well done it is like stepping into the book.<br />HOWEVER:<br />The quality of the DVD is INCREDIBLY BAD!  The picture quality is so poor that if you watch too closely it will strain your eyes.  The sound!  OMG!!!!  It is SO bad!!!!  The background music and sounds are so loud you can barely make out the dialogue.  There is no provision for subtitles--if there were, I would use it and mute the horrible sound so that I could at least follow the story.  I love this series so much for the story and the acting that I endure the exceptionally bad quality of the DVD just to watch it; and I know it is not this certain DVD, but the way it was produced.  SO SO DISAPPOINTING!!  There is nothing &#34;special&#34; about this Special Edition.<br />I can only hope that someone will take on the project of digitally remastering this wonderful production so that true followers of Jane Austin and her wonderful tale may be able to enjoy it in all it's splendor on DVD.<br />If you decide to purchase this series for the shear desire of experiencing Colin Firth in all his glory, please be warned:  You will have to work to enjoy it in spite of the horrible, irritating sound quality and poor video picture.<br />BEWARE!!!

B009G78EE2|3.0|I bought this album a while back, and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it. For many, Macklemore needs no introduction. Known best for \\"Thrift Shop\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us\\", Macklemore is a Seattle-born artist, and his artistic partner and producer is Ryan Lewis. This is the first studio album we've seen from Macklemore.<br /><br />The hype around this album has been crazy. It seems like everyone is bumping Macklemore's songs nowadays. Personally, I find it a bit bizarre. Sure, he's different. He's a unique entry into the rap market, I get it. He doesn't look like your stereotypical hip hop head, and his subject matter many find unique. Thrift Shop is what everyone knows him for best, of course. It's a funny song, but I must question its musical value. Macklemore's flow feels off throughout the entire song; the way he ends his lines are awkward. It's not the lack of rhyme alone, rather he just seems to switch up his flow throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />Alright, fine, so it's entertaining. We'll delve into the rest of the album. The album starts off with Ten Thousand Hours. The hook is kind of catchy and Macklemore has some decent lyrics, but the beat is fairly annoying. Can't Hold Us is fun, and you can tell he put effort into how he spits his lyrics on this one. I'm not sure if the lyrics actually mean anything, but this song is clearly not meant to be one of his deeper entries on the album. It is certainly one of the most well put-together tracks.<br /><br />Next up is Thrift Shop, which I discussed earlier. Thin Line earns the accolade of having the weirdest sounding beat ever. Same Love is one of his more popular tracks, and for good reason. It's a heartfelt song, and Macklemore shows his passion for equality. Mary Lambert provides a fantastic hook. This is one of the standout tracks.<br /><br />You get a few more mediocre tracks, before hitting White Walls. That song features Schoolboy Q, and it's definitely worth a listen. It's pretty meaningless lyrically, but I can jam to it. Jimmy Iovine is a pretty odd track. It's definitely got a more traditional rap feel to it, and almost sounds like a hype track.<br /><br />Wing$ has a good message, and it is passionate. However, it's nothing you will want to listen to over and over.<br /><br />A Wake is one of my favorite tracks. It's got a strong social message from Macklemore, and he addresses his fanbase. He touches on racial issues, and overall, the song just works well. The production is high quality as well.<br /><br />The album fades out with three more mediocre tracks.<br /><br />The Heist, I believe, suffers with a few major issues. First, Macklemore's flow gets old, fast. Every song just sounds similar. This is also due to, I believe, the same formula being used in so many of the songs. Verse followed by a random female (occasionally a random male) doing a hook. The beats are OK, but they're not anything earth shattering.<br /><br />I also find it odd how many things I've seen saying Macklemore is a game changer and a savior to hip hop. Is he talented? Yes. Does he have an audience? Yes. However, I can't see him being a major influence in the rap industry. Because, while he's talented, he's not as amazing as people play him up. He's unique, but that doesn't equate to the album being great.<br /><br />This is an album you should check out on Spotify or something before buying. There are really not that many tracks on this album worth listening to more than a few times.

B00992CF6W|1.0|Forget everything else this game has to offer, this software is not ready for the market. I've tried several times to play this with my son with my phone and his Kindle Fire. The connection drops much too easily and when it does, whoever is on the Kindle loses their entire inventory.<br />Some of that stuff can literally take hours to mine the materials and craft together. I was really enjoying the fact that through this game my son was learning that getting things you want in the world requires you to go out and do the work. He did that, with a little help from me, and managed to craft an entire suit of armor just to have it vanish with a disconnection. I suppose that's a life lesson as well: don't buy any of the crap put out by this company.<br />There's also the issue that the Kindle can join a game started on the phone, but the phone cannot join a game started on the Kindle. This means that my son can't play by himself unless I hand over my phone, avoiding which is the whole reason I paid for the Kindle in the first place.<br /><br />Absolute crap. Infuriating.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|When confronted by his own vulnerability, Tony Stark made himself stronger with his Iron Man suit. But now he's seen that for all his power, there are plenty of people out there bigger and badder than him.<br /><br />In that way, &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; isn't really a sequel to the previous &#34;Iron Man&#34; movies, but a sequel to &#34;The Avengers.&#34; With that in mind, director Shane Black brings a more introspective, raw quality to the third movie about the man in the mechanical suit -- there's still plenty of quirky humor and Robert Downey Jr. being awesome, but it's trying to be more introspective.<br /><br />Ever since the events of &#34;The Avengers,&#34; Tony Stark (Downey) has been suffering from panic attacks and insomnia. He's also been compulsively building newer, stronger Iron Man suits, and even injects himself with nanotech that allows him to control the suits with his will. Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) isn't pleased about his weird behavior.<br /><br />Then a cruel new terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) unleashes a series of bombings on US soil. When one of the bombings badly injures Happy (Jon Favreau), an angry Tony challenges him to come and get him. Bad idea: the Mandarin bombs Tony's seaside mansion to the ground, and Tony is presumed dead. But he's not dead -- he's just stranded in Tennessee, with a broken suit.<br /><br />And as he works to fix his suit, Tony discovers that the terrorists are somehow involved with an experimental virus known as Extremis -- which the think-tank genius Killian (Guy Pearce) has been showing off to Pepper. Now Tony must not only get himself back together, but unravel an elaborate conspiracy centered around Extremis. If he doesn't, he may lose everything that he loves.<br /><br />Expect &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; to be very different from the previous two movies, because director Shane Black (best known for &#34;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&#34;) has a very different style from Jon Favreau. In this case, he's trying to blend together a fiery, fast-moving thriller with a more introspective look at Tony Stark -- who is he and what can he do without his armor? What is most important to him? Is the armor just his security blanket against the big bad world?<br /><br />Don't worry, things don't get too angsty. There's still plenty of Tony's quirky humor (giant stuffed bunny) and some gloriously white-hot action scenes -- which are made even cooler by the presence of Tony's independently-moving Iron Man suits. Awesome. And even in the tense, dark scenes, Black is able to insert some clever dialogue (&#34;Don't shoot! Seriously, I don't even like working here. They are so weird!&#34;) and dark slapstick (Tony running into a truck).<br /><br />The biggest problem? When Tony lands in Tennessee, the plot's momentum grinds to a halt, and it doesn't start up again until he leaves. I don't know why we needed this whole section with Tony's tattooed fanboy and the kid who helps him fix his suit -- it feels totally disconnected from everything else.<br /><br />As usual, Robert Downey Jr. is complete perfection here. On the one hand, he's still the snarky, clever technical genius (&#34;'a cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner' could be the name of my autobiography!&#34;), but his Tony is also struggling to deal with his insecurities and fears. Downey gives a beautifully subtle depiction of post-traumatic stress disorder, revealing Tony's fears without making him seem weak.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is almost as great -- Paltrow gets some awesome scenes as a self-assured woman dealing with a very difficult boyfriend, and she even has an awesome action scene. Don Cheadle is awesome, Guy Pearce is wonderfully creepy, and Ben Kingsley... well, who is more perfect to play a charismatic, eerie terrorist? Nobody!<br /><br />&#34;Iron Man 3&#34; suffers from a dead spot in the middle, but otherwise it rounds off the Iron Man trilogy beautifully -- and while it's wrapped up, the door is left open for more adventures. Just don't expect the same kind of story.dventures. Just don't expect the same kind of story.

B001NOD0Q8|5.0|Ender Wiggin is a very unusual boy -- he's a brilliant tactician, a genius, and a despised \\"third\\" in a future that only allows two children. He's also six years old.<br /><br />And despite the fact that Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic is about a little boy learning how to be a warrior, \\"Ender's Game\\" is a pretty gripping and sometimes grim adventure story. The descriptions of children being taught out how to be cold-blooded warriors is pretty creepy, but the well-developed future world that Card comes up with is pretty awesome.<br /><br />After a fight with a gang of bullies, Ender Wiggin is approached by an army officer who wants him to join the elite Battleschool, where kid geniuses become soldiers -- basically because aliens are about to attack Earth AGAIN and may end up wiping out the human race. His brother Peter is too wild and cruel, and his beloved sister Valentine is too mild-mannered.<br /><br />Ender accepts, and quickly finds himself in a dog-eat-dog space school where he soon becomes loathed for the special treatment the teachers occasionally give him -- when they aren't observing his every move. And it soon becomes obvious that Ender has a natural ability that exceeds that of most of the Battleschool recruits: he instinctively knows how to outmaneuver his opponents and protect himself in a fight, even if he annoys some of the \\"army\\" commanders who don't like being outshone.<br /><br />Back on Earth, his brother and sister try to alter the increasingly unstable politics of Earth by subtle manipulation of the public, a situation that may bring the ruthless Peter into greater power. And as Ender reaches the end of his training, he faces both the buggers and the knowledge of what he is capable of.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is kind of an unusual space opera, because the actual war between humans and buggers is not front-and-center until the last act of the story. Up until then, it's about following Ender and his equally unusual siblings as they develop prematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason). Ender's time at Battle School and Command School feel rather slow at times, only for things to blossom in the final laps of the novel -- Card suddenly turns all our feelings and expectations on their heads. The tragedy of children turned into soldiers becomes even more tragic as we discover what the war is actually all about.<br /><br />As you'd expect from Fascist Hogwarts In Space, there are a lot of kids at Battle School who are developed to certain degrees. But the center of the story is Ender himself -- and despite being a tactical genius with loads of natural ability, Ender never seems like a Wesley Crusher. Like a boy destined to be a Spartan warrior, his inborn skills are what will keep him from ever finding peace. His childhood is sacrificed for war.<br /><br />The other part of the story rests on Peter and Valentine -- Valentine is too nice, while Peter is gradually revealed to be a ruthless genius who works anything and anyone for his goals, which may or may not be self-serving. It's oddly fun to see the growing influence of \\"Demosthenes\\" and \\"Locke\\" on the cruel government.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is an intelligent, gripping space opera with an undercurrent of intense tragedy -- it's kind of slow at times, but the strong writing and intriguing main trio keep it afloat.rematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason).

B00COHGO7U|5.0|\\"Psycho\\" is one of those rare movies that needs no introduction, by a director who also needs no introduction.<br /><br />It's one of the greatest horror movies of all time, and it deserves to be. Alfred Hitchcock's magnum opus is a clean-cut, low-budget affair that lulls you with its slow, uneasy pace, only to shock you with bursts of bloody violence that practically make you jump out of your chair. And the acting -- especially by Tony Perkins -- is absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is entrusted with $40,000, which she's supposed to deposit in the bank for her employer. Instead, she steals the money for her impoverished boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). She ends up staying overnight at a remote motel, where the only other people are the owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his crazy invalid mother.<br /><br />Then someone kills Marion in the shower. Believing his mother is responsible, a desperate Norman cleans up the crime scene and hides the body.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) is doing her best to find both her sister and the $40,000, hiring a private eye and trying to figure out where Marion went before her disappearance. Teaming up with Sam Loomis, she begins seeking out whoever saw her last -- but neither of them are prepared for the true horror of Bates Motel.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Psycho\\" is probably that, like most legendary movies with a twist, the brilliant twist ending is so well known that its impact is lessened. Pretty much everybody knows what's going to happen and what is going on, so it isn't as shocking as it probably was back in 1960. It's sort of like \\"I am your father\\" or \\"You blew it up!\\" -- everybody knows the twist.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean that \\"Psycho\\" isn't still freakishly scary and beautifully-made. Hitchcock's direction is clean, smooth and elegant, painting the screen with light and shadow like a master painter. He fills every scene with a slow-building sense of unease, even if nothing bad is actually happening at the moment. It's quiet, restrained...<br /><br />... until suddenly a shadowy figure lunges out and starts stabbing somebody, while the screeching violins stab right along. The violence isn't very graphic, but it's incredibly shocking.<br /><br />As Norman Bates, Tony Perkins gave one of the greatest performances you'll ever see in a film -- he comes across as shy and boyish, with an ineffable charm. He comes across as a harmless momma's boy who's probably never even talked to a girl before. But even from the start, there are hints that he can abruptly transform into something dark and twisted.<br /><br />In fact, his is probably the only performance you'll truly remember from the movie. Not that the other actors aren't good -- Miles and Leigh give brilliant low-key performances as a pair of desperate young women -- but Perkins is just SO perfect and chilling that you can't get over him.<br /><br />\\"Psycho\\" doesn't need a recommendation from anyone at this point -- it's one of those brilliant movies that has achieved a mythic status.

0345803485|5.0|I loved the book because it dealt with up to date love and sex and did not really hide anything. My friend is reading it now and she had asked me to check off or bracket the special parts that I liked. I did so because several parts reminded me of sex with my late wife and that is how Jeanne now tries to turn me on and satifies me and I am 82 and she is 79 years  old. It is a very entertainng and appropriate book for up to date sex. Dennis
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome. For all you fans. This is a must buy. Once you stop you cant stop reading this book. A must read!
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Good movie with neat effects. However, setting it in a high school was a baffling choice given the casting. The actor playing the lead was 21 years old when this was filmed. The actress playing his girlfriend (also a student) was 25 when this was filmed. The bad \\"kid\\" (an 11th-grader) was played by a 24-year old. And they all look their ages, so it was distracting trying to continue to believe these were high school students (interestingly enough, I had no problem suspending belief regarding one of them being an alien....). The movie would have been far, far more solid for me if it were set at least at a college, though why not in a workplace? Or age them a tad and make them teachers. Other than that nonsense, it was an entertaining movie.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|Me and my husband talk about this movie all the time because it reminds us of our childhood so I thought it would be a cool gift and it was!!! Just as I remembered. I would really recommend this movie to bring back memories!

Fun, cute graphics, and I moved along easily despite not much guidance.<br />To give you a comparison, Angry Birds is too hard for me to enjoy,but Burn The City is easy for me. Very refreshing to take a break and level the city.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Haven't watched this movie since I was a child, but watched it for the first time in years. This movie just touches your heart. An old man that always wanted a son and how the son ends up finding the father. Love.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|The dark nature of the author's work intrigues me a lot.  I picked this up after reading her other novel \\"Dark Places,\\" which I loved (still haven't read her best seller).  For a first novel, this is an excellent book.  I loved the way the story plays out, slowly and methodically.  The protagonist is a writer for a low end newspaper and when her boss learns there could be a breaking story in her hometown, she sends her back to work the story.  While hating where she grew up, as well as the people in the small town, and her own family, the main character sticks it out.  The story is about the murder of a young girl.  She begins to follow her suspicions regarding this mysterious murder and then another happens right under her nose.  Eventually these suspicions grow into something more, and she goes from reporter to amateur detective.<br /><br />The end of the book was great, but the beginning lagged a bit for me, and the substance of the book was heavy.  It didn't read as smoothly as her other work.  Had I read this before \\"Dark Places\\" I may have enjoyed it more. Advice: Read this one first, then the others.  Not to say this isn't a gripping, mystery novel, IT IS.  I would read anything written by this woman because it really feeds into my need for unique and strange subjects.  If you are interested in something that isn't completely run-of-the-mill, I would highly suggest this book, as well as her others because she really delivers.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|With each season Merlin just keeps gettiing better and better. The writing is strong, the acting is phenomenal, the core cast have grown more into their roles and there's no turning back. This season is the darkest one yet and the stakes are even higher. Ending was not what I had anticipated but if you have been a Merlin fan since the beginning or are just starting out, you need to watch this final, epic season. Tagging along with these characters and seeing them to the end, while heartbreaking, is so fulfilling. The bond between Merlin and Arthur is as strong as ever this series, and it is because of that bond that Merlin has to make some of the hardest decisions he has ever made. My only complaint about this season is the torment and weight of Merlin's destiny weighs him down quite heavily in this season. To see Colin Morgan sad always breaks my heart!<br /><br />Cannot tell you how much I adore Colin Morgan. He is truly a phenomenal actor. He brings so many layers to Merlin and provides you with so much emotion even with one look. He pulls you in! It is through Merlin this journey has been told and because of Colin Morgan that we fell in love with Merlin. Not only does he play Merlin, but he is able to play more than on character (i.e. Dragoon, and prepare yourself for one of his more hilarious characters to date) with such vitality and life! Katie McGrath is even more deliciously evil in this new series. To see her journey from the strong headed young woman from the 1st season to this bone chilling priestess who borders on the edge of madness is a true testament to Katie McGrath's genius. Bradley James plays Arthur with so much more drive this season, noble to the core you can see why Merlin would risk his life for Arthur. It's not beause of his destiny. It is because of his friend. Bradley James brings so much nuance and vulnerability to Arthur, yet under it all is steely resolve. It's little details that can be hard to miss, but he plays them so well you are truly caught up in the story. You believe in him. You believe in Arthur.<br /><br />Break out the tissues folks, cause the end is nigh.ruly caught up in the story. You believe in him.

B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I really love this part of the Twilight series because it shows how deeply the love goes for these two characters.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|I cannot tell you how much I love Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. He has this rugged rawness to the character that takes him to a whole new level. Just not sure about the plot with this one. Felt strong at the beginning, but got kind of shaky near the end. All in all a good movie, but not one of my favorite bond movies.
0812982622|5.0|It's long and it's won the Pulitzer and it's rumored to be depressing. That's enough to make many readers feel hesitant about diving in. But this book is so masterful, so beautifully written, so intriguing, SO worth it!<br /><br />We read it for book club; most people confessed that they dreaded starting it. But every single one of us loved it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Ms Harris had eleven prior books to consider how she was going to end this series and if this book is  the best she could come up with, well the joke is on her fans. This book is such a jumble, it's a mess.  Every character that Sookie ever met since the night Bill walked into the bar is in this book. But not in a good way. They're just thrown in. This book is a waste of time and a waste of money.

193700788X|2.0|Before my review, let me first say that I am horrified that there were some who blurted out the HEA on CH's facebook wall before the release or that some threatened her life. Those people need a serious reality check. This is fiction, no need to wish bad juju on anyone or ruin the ending for anyone who may not want to know beforehand. However, not all the readers who didn't like the book are coo-coo crazy like that.<br /><br />***********Everything past this point contains SPOILERS*************<br /><br />Second, I like Sam. I like that Sookie considered him a friend but it would have been less of a shock if there had been more of a romantic buildup to him before the last book. The thing is that I have a hard time jumping from friend to lover or brother figure to lover when that former description has been repeated over and over and over and over and over. I had this same issue with CH's last book in the Harper series. I need to be shown the gradual change, not told.<br /><br />As referenced in my review title, my constant feeling throughout the book was confusion. A lot of things simply didn't make sense. For instance, why Sookie didn't seem all that concerned with losing Eric when days before she was terrified of losing him. Or why she slept with Sam so soon after the divorce. Or why she was cussing so much all of a sudden. All of those things, plus more I am sure, is why I felt Sookie acted out of character than what we had been previously shown about her. I thought her speech at the end about maybe this or that, I'll be fine either way, would have been more powerful if she had been devastated about Eric leaving but through hanging out with Sam and her other friends, was able to get to that state of mind to say that. Her very own Scarlett moment. And that sex scene. Yikes. I was uncomfortable reading that. For one, it just felt odd and two, animals or dirt mentioned in a sex scene do not equal sexy times for me. I think if the sex scene had been left out altogether, and instead Sookie and Sam kiss at the end, the HEA would have made more sense to me. At least that would have showed me that she wanted to take things slow. How are you gonna take things slow when you have already seen each other naked? Again, not understanding here.<br /><br />Then, I was confused about the fact that Sookie ended up with someone whose mind she can read. That's why *I* don't understand why some can't understand the shock of this. I think all of us considered the idea that Sookie might not end up with a vampire because of the whole aging thing but all we had to go by was Sookie's POV. I do not ever remember reading that Sookie could never see a vampire relationship happening long term OR that she might be ok after all being with someone whose mind she can read OR that she definitely wanted kids one day. So yeah, it really bothers me when people make us out to be morons for reaching the conclusion we did in regards to a vamp ending. I don't know how she could have ended it with a vamp ending because of the aging thing, but since this was a series about fairies, werewolves, shape-shifters, vampires, elves, and other were-animals, I thought maybe there was room for one more imaginative theory. Silly me, though. I thought that pesky mind reading ability was the reason for introducing the vampires in the first place. Which leads me to my next point.<br /><br />What was the point of Sookie meeting and falling in love with a vampire in the first place if she wasn't going to end up with one? What was the point of her going through all the crap she did, (murdered parents and grandmother, shot, staked and raped, and tortured by fairies) if she didn't find true love, or as close to true love as one can get? Another thought that coincides with this one is why didn't Sam ever get in line? He had five years to date her before the first book even started. I would have liked to have heard a reason in DEA. It would have been cool if Queen Sophie-Anne had orderedhim not to date her because it would interfere with Bill's mission(maybe they had previous dealings before)but that contract was void upon her death or if Niall somehow approached him for whatever reason. This kind of over-arching mystery would have been awesome to find out in DEA. Then, we all could have been like oh poor Sam, he wasn't able to ever tell her or date her.<br /><br />Obviously, I read the signs wrong in thinking it was the Eric and Sookie Love Story 2013. But that's just it, there were signs so it's not like we just imagined all of it. Like love professions( \\"I do love you all on my own\\") and promises (\\"She won't win\\"). So they loved each other but were torn apart anyway? I think in fiction I tend to be the eternal optimist mostly because we all live in a world that is often negative for no reason, so why not hope for the best? I totally thought it would be a darkest before dawn type of thing and just one more obstacle they would have to overcome like they did in the previous 3 books. So the message that \\"love is great when you finally find it, but in the end it will just let you down so it's not worth fighting for, especially if you are too different\\" is really depressing to me. If Eric had gotten out of the marriage but they had a Come To Jesus Talk and decided it was for the best to go their separate ways, it would have been closure for me and therefore, made sense. Then, he could have still went to OK willingly and Sookie would have chosen Sam instead. That would have been a more positive ending for me, not the impression I got, which was that Sookie just settled for Sam. Now, maybe that is not what CH intended, but I am saying for A LOT, I mean A LOT of people, that seems to be what was written in the book. I feel that if at some point, maybe book 11 when the blood bond was broken, we should have been told that Sookie was unsure if she loved Eric enough to be with with him forever, and so when Sookie saved Sam at the end of DL, there was a lightbulb moment where she realized that she loved Sam instead. But no, that didn't happen. What happened was that Sookie was still proclaiming in DEA that she loved Eric. I guess what I am saying is that she had 13 books to really set up a possible Sam ending, or provide the Eric fans with doubt.<br /><br />Ok, I get it---I was way off. But why did Eric's character have to be annihilated in the process? After the \\"she won't win\\" comment, I was shocked that Eric didn't put up much of a fight when in DTTW, he did when it came to Hallow threatening him for far less. Then, it was revealed in DEA that Eric wishes he had just turned Sookie long ago without her permission like he did with Pam and Karin. But yet in DAG, Chapter 10 he tells Sookie he would never turn her against her will because he knew she didn't want it. So, which is it? So again, color me confused.<br /><br />Shocking I know, but not all my gripes/confusion have to do with the HEA. I felt that the writing in general was different than in previous books. It didn't have the same charm and humor as the other books. Also, switching from 3rd person POV to first person made it really hard to follow. I think it would left more of the mystery if we had experienced everything through Sookie's eyes or if the extra POV changed to first person. But maybe I wasn't used to it and that's why I had that reaction. I was confused about the Big Bad's. I get why Steve Newlin hated Sookie to the point where he wanted her dead but not the other men. I still don't get the whole Claude thing as it is. And Sookie was kidnapped AGAIN? Really? In a crowded place, no less? I just thought as a finale, the plot was kinda weak. I was hoping for a OMG, what a helluva ride type of ending.<br /><br />Overall though, I am not sorry for finding these books and recommending them to others, as well as finding other Sookieholics along the way through chatting on the amazon discussions. CH is the one I credit for opening up the paranormal romance/urban fantasy genres for me, as before Sookie, I never read vampire books. Even though I think CH has been a little unfair in her role in all of the controversy, I hope her next series does well. I just also hope that at some point she realizes that most of us do have legitimate criticisms and that disappointed readers does not always equal entitled readers.tbulb moment where she realized that she loved Sam instead.

However, I must note that in general I like any film that's good.  It does not matter what genre.  There are good \\"chick flicks\\" out there, this is one of the worst.

147674355X|5.0|Seventeen-year-old Sky has led a sheltered life - home schooled, no TV, no cellphone, no internet. Her best friend, Six, lives across the street and has a horrible reputation. A reputation that has given Sky a reputation simply through association, and not based entirely in fact. Now Sky is getting ready to attend public school for senior year, just as Six is heading off to Europe via an exchange program. High school turns out to be just as horrible as Sky predicts and she is forced to endure her classmates rather unimaginative slurs and attempts to bring her down. Her only solace is Breckin, a fellow outcast.<br /><br />Sky's life takes a most unexpected turn after a simple trip to the grocery store where she meets Dean Holder, a boy with a reputation worse than hers. She finds herself drawn to him and feeling things that no one else has ever made her feel. Sky knows that Holder is no good and that she should stay away from him, but he seems determined to know everything about her. He feels dangerous to Sky and his mood swings leave her reeling. What she doesn't know is that Holder is tied to a past that she never realized she had, and being with Holder drags her back into it. Meeting Holder changes every single facet of Sky's life and she is left questioning who she is, where she comes from, and what the future holds for her.<br /><br />This book was heart-achingly good and Dean Holder is my new literary hero. Readers be warned - this book deals with some heavy stuff, including sexual abuse. The twists in this story are amazing and Colleen Hoover weaved this story together beautifully. It was in no way predictable for me. Usually I can figure out where stories like this are headed fairly quickly, but with Hopeless I often found myself not realizing a twist until it was just about to happen. Sky and Holder are beautifully flawed and their love story made my heart swell over and over while my eyes fill with tears. They are two damaged souls who save each other. This is a solid 5 star read for me, a rating that I do not dish out often. I know that this book will become a re-read (several times over) for me. Fantastic book!<br /><br />Check out more of my reviews at [...]is a solid 5 star read for me, a rating that I do not dish out often.

Her father died unexpectedly and now her mother, younger brother Kel and Layken have packed up their home, left Texas behind, and moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan. Just when all hope seems lost, Layken meets Will Cooper. Will is her 21-year-old, attractive neighbor with a passion for slam poetry. Layken and Will form an intense emotional connection and Layken finds herself falling for Will hard, even after only knowing him a few days.<br /><br />Their relationship takes an unexpected turn when Layken discovers that Will is in fact her new poetry teacher. Will, who is caring for his younger brother, Caulder, after the death of their parents cannot afford to jeopardize his job, which means that Layken and he have to break it off. Now the two are left with daily awkward exchanges and broken hearts. Layken's world is further rocked when the real reason why her family moved to Michigan is revealed. The only thing that Layken seems to know for real is that she loves Will, but will they ever be able to overcome all of the obstacles life has placed in their way?<br /><br />I loved this series! Loved, loved, loved it! I have to admit when it was revealed that Will has in fact Layken's teacher I thought that was it, that there was no way I was going to make it through this book. As a teacher, the idea of anything but a professional relationship between student and teacher just grosses me out. But I am also OCD when it comes to finishing a book and I'm glad that I was able to work past that little issue, because I really enjoyed this series. The characters are fantastic and create a wonderfully imperfect family, proving yet again that blood does not always a family make and that the human heart is stronger than it may appear.<br /><br />Check out more of my reviews at [...]

But \\"SC\\" is something different, it is also fun to listen but more modern and even more funky. It became also one of my all time favorite albums. Definitely no one - except DF -  can create 10 seconds of music of this special style.  One fussy thing: Tracktitels miss Kerning Type.

The movie was also excellent, but for different reasons. The book and the movie are so incredibly different - so you can definitely read/ watch both. If you want a good story, definitely read this book. It truly is excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surface is so freaking cool I once challenged people and I had a high score it was so fun
B00C32R64G|5.0|I am really impressed by these guys. Only recently discovered them, but they definitely have a bright future. Keep it up.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read Hopeless by this author and loved it. I wrote to her to tell her that and mentioned I wanted to read Slammed. She wrote back and said that since it's more of a young adult story I might not like it as much. I LOVED IT. I am a senior citizen and I did not feel as though I was reading a book that was meant for younger people. I had no idea what Slammed meant so that was also a learning experience and I really thought those poems were fabulous. So meaningful and passionate. I have read the entire series and highly recommend it. This was an amazing story of love and hope.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughters love it!  It's fantastical!  I would say its for 8 to 12 year old girls. It is super fun!
B001I45UFC|5.0|What a lovely book, and such a great introduction to fantasy stories. I really enjoyed reading this the first time in the 70s as a kid, and again with my own son. Magical.
0062082353|5.0|This book takes you into the life and mind of a great hero. It is one of the best books that I have read in the last several years. Chris takes you right into the heat of battle and sheds light on the way it really was without the spin. I am proud to have served in the Navy knowing that such a hero also served. Semper Fortis!!!!! I was deeply saddened by Chris' untimely and totally unnecessary death. May God Bless his family
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I've read the book too many times, but found this adaptation enjoyable. The imagery was great, and the changes were, well, expected.
B006FE83UE|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  I will treasure this anniversary edition.  It's set in a by-gone era, but the statement made is timeless.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie leaves you thankful that there is always hope even in the worst of circumstances and that love drives people to do the impossible for one another. I was moved deeply and thank God that this family was able to come together after such a horrific experience. Out of so much tragedy, this family's story brings some comfort.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book is so spot on its scary.  The fact that the tried-and-true manufacturing techniques are conveyed in such an easy to understand manner (as they relate to IT Organizations), makes even the most rookie to process creation/improvement connect to the author.  My colleagues and I were so impressed with this that we are trying to compile a list of required reading for our office; this book is at the top of the list.  There is a reason that the reviews are what they are, don't think twice.
B001P06GX4|4.0|Blokus is a challenging, inventive game with various tile shapes in four colors.  The strategy is to continue building connections to your own tiles, touching only one corner, while building obstacles to other players' connections.  The game won Dr. Toy's 100 Best Children's Products award for 2003, and was a national competition winner of Mensa Select.  It was the Speil des Jahres winner for 2002.<br /><br />It is a game that is more fun with more people.  There are more tiles played, so challenges build more quickly.<br /><br />That said, we found that the game's novelty wears thin after playing a few times.  Perhaps it's because the game is constrained by the number and selection of tiles you have, so that inevitably game play is repetitive (I know, you're supposed to use the tiles strategically, but the strategies are repetitive).  This contrasts with a game like chess, where the variation of possible moves generates a spectacularly more varied number of outcomes and strategies.  But then, chess also has a much higher learning curve that makes it less fun for many beginners.<br /><br />Players who enjoy Blokus would also enjoy another game of spatial strategy, Labyrinth.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I loved this movie, great actors and great story!  Denzel did not disappoint.  John Goodman was good too.  Will watch again.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Keep your mind sharp and shoot for low times!  This game will keep you thinking and keep your mind sharp.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|MY GRAND KIDS LIKE IT A LOT.THEY PLAY IT WHEN THERE ARE OVER AND IT'S GRATE IN THE CAR. THANKS
B00942G4UA|5.0|I have been telling all my friends about this movie, it is a tail of the down fall of this country
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Games is to slow and not intertaining, not much if a  game, sorry i got it. should be able to try befor you buy, IF THAT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE I WOULD NOT HAVE GOT THE GAME.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|great app for all ages and genders.this fun game helps you use your imaginative thinking.when you are bored and want to play it ,you will never be bored again.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I poop on people and I blame it on seagulls. four of us driving and singing the catchy music and going with the beat
B000EQ47GS|5.0|memories of the awesome collegue years times.  brings back great memories from driving back & forth from/to college and the weekend parties
B009UX2YAC|3.0|There should be levels.  It just keeps going. we like the game thou. It's just gets boring after do.many games.
B000IDEQTK|3.0|It was an OK movie ending could have been better but overall it was entertaining Helen Hunt did a great job in her role
B00CL68BK2|3.0|It started out with a mystique about it, but turned into a typical romance drama you could find on the Hallmark channel.  I recommend it but, was a bit disappointing.
8866130923|5.0|I love the layout. I can briefly write what appointments on the various days. The lined note page allows me to jot anything - things to do, shopping, interesting ideas.. peoples numbers. It fits in my purse. The format it perfect for me - I am finally happy with my diary.<br />(I can put receipts or cards in the back flap. The elastic and ribbon are great to keep it closed and open to the current date.
B001NA6096|4.0|This movie is all dialogue, which I didn't mind.  If you like listening to interesting conversations and random acts of enlightenment, you will enjoy this film.  No fanciful or riveting storylines here; just a simple unfolding of a genuine connection between two human beings...set against one of the most romantic and exotic backdrops, of course.  ;)
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Absolutely the best book I've read recently-and I read one or two books per week. Great concept, great story, wonderful characters, well written. Pretty much everything a serious reader could ask for. Not for light readers, you cannot plow thru it in day. I'm frequently disappointed when I pick up a book and finish it in just a few hours because its fluff. The Windup Girl is anything but.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|wonderful story and superb graphics.  Colors were stuning.  I would highly recommend this movie.  I just wished I had seen it at the theatre.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|I don't have a lot to say about this game.  It bored me.  It might be very entertaining to some people who have a lot of patience but that's not me.
B004TI5N38|4.0|This was a good story, but many times I thought I was reading a Lee Child novel. Even the physical description and military background of John Puller was so much like Lee Child's Jack Reacher.
B000S1L7IU|5.0|I have read several of Clive Cussler books and have enjoyed all of them.  This was interesting because I had just read the article in National Geographic that talked about scientist wanting to isolate wooly mammoth DNA.  It was great.  I loved the ending.  Very exciting, I couldn't turn off my Kindle until I was done.
B00B23O97Y|3.0|Ok it's Clapton, so how can we go wrong? well... TBH, NOT my favorite offering from such a great musician.If you're expecting the flare & life of the Clapton of old: Cream, Blind Faith, Derek & the Dominos, crossroads etc; then prepare to be dissapointed.<br />So what does it sound like? It's very bluesy with reggae influences. Imagine him sat on the porch in his rocking chair...<br />The vinyl is clean, a great pressing, nice & quiet with depth &3D imagery, and worth about 3stars overall,the grade being biased as I didn't like the music all that much.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The game itself is quite fun and addictive, but the quality of the game is horrible!!  It freezes up half of the time and a lot of those times are when you are trying to collect your rewards.  In the end you put more into it than you get out.  Hopefully they improve it-then I'll return.
B008HOR7UM|5.0|A must for all Mark Knopfler fans, & indeed anyone who enjoyed the Dire Straits sound.Bought on Vinyl, this double album is packed full of goodies, pressed on heavy weight quality wax, & nicely packaged. I liked it so much I bought a spare copy!<br />Treat your ears, & add this to your collection!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Started slow, but picked up considerably after the action moved to the ship. The movie trailers interested me in reading the book first.  Can't wait to we the movie and compare.
B001BSH11G|5.0|Yellow brick road on vinyl. Excellent pressing, clean sonic presentation with great depth & focus.Whilst I've never been a 'die hard' Elton follower,as such, after listening to this great double album,it's not hard to understand why he has superstar status;& deservedly so. Try to resist singing along to the title track... I couldn't!! a well deserved 5 stars.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|In the middle of a game, it freezes and you can't continue. You have to shut down and start over.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This series was a pleasant surprise for me. I don't usually watch TNT so I never started to watch this on regular tv but thanks to my kindle fire I gave it a shot and was instantly hooked. I watched all the episodes of seasons 1 and 2 and just recently set my dvr to record the upcoming 3rd season.
B00821OX98|4.0|i like scifi/fantasy the most. and pickings are getting slim for favorite programming, so gave this a try. was not disappointed but not top of my list.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Written by a neurosurgeon lends credibility to Heaven as a place that is available to everyone.  A must read for all.
B00CQ4Y5UY|5.0|I love this show! I bought the season pass But episode 7(sorbet) isn't  available in HD yet??!!!y is that?!?  I see that it's available in SD, getting anxious over here!!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|For me, running lean is better than the Lean Start up by Eric Ries,<br /><br />easier to apply and definitively useful,<br />I have always it available on my Kindle to have a look at some chapter or to the canvas better adapted for the start up and inspired by the Business Model Generation book
B009JZORSI|4.0|This movie was a great movie for its time.  At the time of the movie, this movie was nothing more than a PSA (Public Service Announcement) about saving the humpback whales. This movie was a great sci-fi movie about time travel.  There was a lot of inside jokes about the 80's.  If you did not live during or through 1980's then you probably did not understand some of the references or jokes.  This was also one of the first movies where using \\"color metaphors\\" was allowed and used.  Also this was the second \\"Star Trek\\" movie that the actress who portrays the \\"mother\\" on \\"TheCW\\"'s hit tv show \\"7th Heaven\\" came from.  Overall, if you want to see what the 80's was like just watch this wonderful movie.<br /><br />Also, this movie had used parts of the \\"Monterey Bay Aquarium\\".  I would suggest visiting there sometime.  That place was great to visit.  Although they never actually had any real humpback whales.  Since humpback whales are big.  That little aquarium would never have been able to used to keep real humpback whales in.
B000FC1KBG|3.0|i used this with Babywise to get my baby to sleep on his own sans CIO.  There are some methods that failed for me (the pickup putdown method--but im a breastfeeding mom so i feel like it was torturing him b/c everytime i picked him up he did the hungry noises like he was going to get fed and when i layed him back down he would scream even more)--rocking in crib or jiggling or patting worked well for us with her &#34;sh - sh&#34; method.  I took some good things from her (not letting baby CIO and treating him like a person and telling him what im going to do before doing it) but wouldnt swear by this book solely.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love these books. Could not put them down! If you are looking for a good read with steamy passion these are the books for you! Thank you Sylvia Day!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Enjoyable for all ages. Graphics are just like in the movie. Very colorful and fun. My ten year old says its a favorite from all devices.
0399160450|5.0|So much of this book could be factual that is  scary.  I only hope the U.S. Government takes this threat to heart and acts accordingly.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|it's not what it's all hyped up to be very slow I would not recommend to my friends,it was a waste of money for me.
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|I had a great time reading this book and traveling vicariously.  It is absolutely NOT a factual, meet-a-place-and-choose-what-you-like sort of work.  It is a wholly subjective journey, and I enjoyed every page.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie shows a good example of the south during slavery of Plantations, but with a lot of foul language and using the N - - - - word a lot
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Being older than the normal demographs at which this movie was aimed, I was not real sure what to expect. It was actually quite good.
B001JU6CGG|3.0|Well I highly doubt very many people are going to watch this movie but in case you've been under a rock for some time and haven't heard of the Mission Impossible series or television series then you should consider watching this just to have watched the series.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good story line...just enough action. Not to cheesie effects. Watched under my prime account. I would recommend to people. Going to watch season two also.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Hangman is a game I have played since a child. Having a digital version is even better as I can play against myself. The large category listing keeps me challenged. I am learning as well especially names of countries that are more obscure.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is entertaining, but wish that health and happiness did not drop so much so fast, and was not so expensive to bring back up.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Watching this DVD prior to my first Il Divo live performance (5/8/2013 at the Ryman Auditorium) set me up for their interactive style with the audience.  But I think Nashville was more in love with them than they even anticipated pre-concert!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is ultimately a love story about two damaged people.  It's not an examination of mental health nor an attempt to diminish or sanctify bipolarism.  I never found the treatment of mental illness funny in this film; in fact, the scenes involving Pat's breakdowns were disturbing and Danny's illness was sadly touching because he accepted his condition and its varying consequences.  The plot has been well discussed in many effective posts so no need to reiterate here.<br />I didn't have a strong desire to see this movie so my enjoyment surprised me.  And the main reason for my enjoyment is the superb casting.  Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Tiffany, as she was in WINTERS BONE, my first exposure to her talents.  She effortlessly embodies Tiffany's persona to create a multi-layered character you can't help liking.  Bradley Cooper is equally stunning as Pat, a performance I hadn't expected.  He too makes his troubled character irresistibly appealing.<br />Robert DeNiro hasn't been this good in years and Jacki Weaver is perfect as Pat's mom.  The rest of the cast including Julia Stiles, John Ortiz and Shea Whigam is excellent.<br />Director David O. Russell commandeers the movie with assured confidence and makes SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK a delightful film experience much more satisfying than the Oscar winning ARGO.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I needed a page turner and this was it.  Echoes of Presumed Innocent by Scot Turow but that was also a great page turner!
0425269205|5.0|The book is gorgeous.  I really love the book.  I read some very negative reviews<br />and I can't agree.  I love all of the Sookie books and I really wonder about all<br />the complainers who claim to know how the book &#34;should&#34; have been.  I mean<br />If they have such wonderful ideas, why don't they write their own book?  H.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|it is awsome how you have to review it to unlock one of the cars. other than that epic pure awesome sauce.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to start this review by stating that I read this book a year ago and was so thoroughly disgusted it took an entire year to find the right words to put here.  Let me try and break this down:<br /><br />NEVER, and I mean NEVER have I read anything this poorly written.  There have been enough reviewers that pointed out all the repetitive phrases, bad grammar and poor editing so I won't elaborate any further on that.<br /><br />The characters are so unrealistic it's embarrassing.  Really?  A 21 year old college student doesn't have an email address?  She's barely even kissed a boy much less masturbated?  She refers to her genitals as \\"down there\\"?  Ugh - it's called a vagina.  And speaking of vaginas, hers seems to explode just by looking at the \\"older\\" man who is dominating her (and by older, I mean....five years.)  Sorry, orgasms just aren't that easy to come by especially for someone so inexperienced.<br /><br />I don't even know what to say about the leading man.  Abusive, controlling, stalkerish are words that come to mind.  The most frightening thing about this book to me is a young girl reading it and hoping that she will find her Christian Grey someday.  This book does women a disservice in every way possible.<br /><br />I'm no prude and the explicit sex scenes, had they been even remotely sexy or realistic, wouldn't have bothered me in the least but I'm supposed to believe that this virgin can orgasm on command and have rough sex multiple times during her first experience and still be able to walk?  It's laughable.<br /><br />I can't imagine who could give this book a good review.  Only someone who is extremely hard-up and has never read a book before could have possibly enjoyed this.  PLEASE stay away from this trash!!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I played this game at my cousins a few years ago. It was $1.99 than happy it went down a dollar. I could only stump the genie once
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I saw many reviews for HOPELESS at Goodreads. But the title worried me, so I asked a fellow reader (that loved it) just how angsty this was going to be. She assured me the drama was around the MCs and not WITH them. I've gotten tired of books where one character or another leaves their loved one for the loved one's sake. Also tired of stupid misunderstandings that lead characters apart.<br /><br />I was assured that this is not the case here. I read it.<br /><br />First, when the last page was read, I thought: FIVE BOOKMARKS!<br /><br />Upon reflection, I will be dropping this to a FOUR.<br /><br />The flow of this story kept me right there, reading until my eyes crossed. Much like Sky did when she receives an ereader and reads two books in one day. Sky and her mother do not \\"do\\" technology. Karen, her mother, has never allowed a TV or cell phones, or computers in the house. Karen creates and sells herbal concoctions at flea markets, etc. Her boyfriend, who doesn't live with them due to the lack of ESPN, helps her.<br /><br />Sky's neighbor, and best friend, Six, has convinced her to try public school for her senior year. She's been home schooled for her entire schooling life. Then Six gets accepted to a foreign exchange post and leaves Sky to face the sharks that swim in the public school pool. Had to laugh a bit at this. Because from what I know, that sums it up nicely.<br /><br />On the first day of school Sky meets a weird a boy wearing hot pink, and later, a hot boy whose intensity makes her catch her breath. He seems to know her. An unlikely alliance is formed.<br /><br />There are secrets in Sky's past. And in Holder's. As a reader, we see through flashbacks what those secrets are. And they hurt my heart.  As a reader, you see what some of the secrets are.<br /><br />Even though this may be called YA by some, I don't think it is. Yes, the MCs are in their late teens, but there is sexual content and themes that not all teens would be ready for. Although the author lists links for suicide and rape help, the way these situations are dealt with in the book are fictionalized. Therapy would be needed, and I would encourage anyone who has any of these situations in their lives to seek help; to tell someone. That's what brought the rating down a bookmark for me.<br /><br />Having said that, this was a fiction book. And reading it as fiction, it was enthralling. It's also one of those books that one either loves, or hates. Reading the other reviews for it (PILES OF REVIEWS) is actually rather entertaining. That's what makes this book one to read. It makes you FEEL.<br /><br />FOUR BOOKMARKS for making me feel for these characters.<br /><br />*Thank you, NetGalley and Atria Publishing, for the opportunity to read HOPELESS.<br /><br />This review may also be found at:<br />Beyond the Squee Book Reviews<br />[...]ions are dealt with in the book are fictionalized.

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a a fine selection of music and artists.  Bocelli never disappoints.  I can listen over and over and over.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. Great story. Great development of details that come back to haunt. I was a little disappointed in the ending.
1476734941|4.0|I watched the BBC Horizon program on PBS and then bought the book. The book basically follows the Horizon program with more detail. If, however, you are looking for more information on the science behind the studies referenced in the documentary, you will not find such detail  in the book. Overall,, I liked how the book was written and found it useful. I am following the diet and seem to have concluded that I have adopted a change in my eating habits rather than been dieting, in a more traditional sense of the word. Good luck to all of you battling with the bulge!
014241493X|5.0|This book lives up to all of his other great books. Really well written and I just really loved it.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|To be different, it's sometimes a gift to humanity. It is a gift that enriches the existential possibilities, the possibilities of perspective, understanding and love for the universe and humans. This book as other books like them ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BXEO1A2  ) make us better people. Y. L-G
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This was a surprise to enjoy this type of game. Hope every one likes it as much.<br />The changing adventures are cool and the idea original.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Caveat:  I am a die-hard Les Miz fan.  It has to be pretty awful for me to say something bad about a performance.<br />This was beyond my expectations!  The acting and singing was first rate.  Sure, the singing wasn't Broadway caliber, but that was the whole point of the movie.  It was filmed as they were acting,  Could the singing have been better - probably.  Could the acting have been better - absolutely not!  I was riveted from the first credits to the last!
B001F6ZIXC|4.0|For the most part, the show is enjoyable.  However, everything to do with Katey Sagal's character screams drama (more than is needed).  I guess that is how they want to play it.  She does a great job, but it is a bit much, if that isn't what you are looking for.  I was never much for over done drama (same thing that made or broke Battlestar Galactica, for the most part), thats why they have daytime soaps.  Again, good show and its worth watching, you just might have to struggle through some of it.
1400069742|5.0|The author brings to life many of the individuals involved in America's struggle to immerse itself in another European conflict. Although I have not finished reading the book, I have noticed a small identification error. The author correctly identifies Senator Gerald Nye as representing North Dakota in early portions of her work. However, she misidentified him as representing South Dakota on page 360 of the book. The book highlights aspects of the period (e.g., Wendell Willkie, peacetime draft conscription, Dr. Seuss war cartoons) that are interesting and demand (at least for myself) further research.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's very accurate of the weather. When it says rain or thunder that's what you can expect. The temperature is correct also. I like realfeel&reg; too.
0385394233|5.0|I bought the CD version of the book because I knew I wouldn't have the chanse to read it for a couple of years.....but listen to it I did.  Sheryl brings up a lot of issues that I have been thinking about and dealing with for a while now.<br /><br />I grew up in a generation where bras were being burned, before I got my first one.......but becasue of those fights I had a better opportunity in the business world.....or so I thought.  I realized that I have leaned back and I've allowed myself to be walked over.  I take responsibility for that....but I will no longer allow others to direct my career....it is my career and up to me to direct!  I don't agree with all of Sheryl's points but I am certaintly willing to listen and discuss.<br /><br />A very interesting book.  Well worth the listen or read for any women.....working outside the home or inside the home.  Every women should give this a read (or listen.)
B00004VVN9|5.0|saw this as a youth and loved it.<br />such a good movie with a good story.<br />too bad Nat died during the production.
B003OUXECE|5.0|If you have played Bioshock, than you know how great the story can be. Well now you know how it all started. This a great prequel to an even more amazing game, and gives you an in depth look at how Andrew Ryan became the founder of Rapture, along with all the other major characters in the game. Before I spoil anything, go read this book!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a good game.  It is nice that it is free.  My kids enjoying playing it as well.  I would having given its 5 stars but there are too many advertisements for other games.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It has creative spins on ideas I would not have thought of, my daughter and I love it!!! Especially the recipes!!Thanks
0470932139|5.0|Helene did such and amazing job with her book! I'm a big fan and follow her work and am in total awe of her talent- her book gave me so many ideas in how to prepare and set up like an artist! I am a portrait photographer and still found everything helpful!
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Pales in comparison to the Godfather and Casino.<br />Sean Penn's make-up is almost plastic looking.<br />Ryan Gosling'' s performance was commendable.<br />Better watched from Red Box for a $1.00.

B009NY43NY|1.0|As a loyal reader who has read and re-read all of the Southern Vampire Novels, I admit the last several books were a dissapointment; however, this HEA made me cry! Not because of the predictable and lackluster ending, but becasue of the poor plot developmnt and deterioration of the characters I loved! I also have to note Charlaine put in 3 different plugs for her latest anthology and ridiculous short story about Sookie and Sam home improvement project for Tara's twins. Wow...I just do not understand why she even wrote book after book about vampires. They should have been titled Southern Shifter Series if she knew it would end this way.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A friend recommended this book.<br />Liked the way it was written from two perspectives. Nick is the character you end up liking.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|\\"Lean In\\" is well written, and challenges all of us - women and men - to take personal responsibility for our lives, while also acknowledging that we are all part of a \\"whole village\\" with shared opportunities for personal and corporate growth.  A great read!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was late to the Hunger Games craze. After the hubbub had died down, I read the first book in the series and knew I was hooked. Collins is a captivating writer with a knack for dialogue. Like so many before me, I heartily recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game requires more skill than I have for video games.  The graphics are great, the game just isn't forme
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I was looking for a good easy read and I found it. Some wrote about the relationship and how Travis treated Abby. You have to read to understand the relationship, most did not give it time. At Abby`s young age and no dating life she makes mistakes that most girls would make. Would read again and you must read walking disaster next.
B0097K21YW|1.0|loaded on kindle fire and while an ok game....screen reproducability of similar shots not very good...moving screen a problem ...needs screen freeze or instructions how to... CROSSHair unclear on its function needs work....I will uninstall until update.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It has all the prerequisite s needed for critical thinking: a great story, question of religion, magical realism. One of my new favorite books. Beautiful, LOL funny, heart breaking. A must read.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great cast, great writing and severely intense is how I would describe the Sheild. If you are a fan of the Wire, Breaking Bad or Sons of Anarchy this show is how it all started. Must watch.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|My love of GoT started with Season 1 of the HBO series. After the season ended, I immediately picked up Book 1 of Martin's series. Wow! While the number of characters can get overwhelming, the level of intrigue and suspense surrounding each one is addictive! I'm pleased at how closely the HBO series follows the storyline of each book, and that those variations that do occur add to the story, don't distract or take away from it. As a person who doesn't consider myself a big Sci-fi fan, I give this series of books an enthusiastic thumbs up!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, the Jack REacher series rocks!  This was a great book, and right in line with what I have come to expect from Lee Child.
0525953728|4.0|I did not put the book down until I finished it. It was interesting to read, and informative, considering it comes directly from the source. It was the first book of this type I read, and I liked it very much, bearing in mind it was not written by a professional writer.<br />It tells a good story that I trust, with the feeling that the author tells the truth but does not disclose any classified information.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Best season yet! I have every season they have out and this one is just as good or better than the others!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watch very few movies, and even fewer all the way through. Hunger Games is a well, above the standard B-grade movie, without the accuracy and expansion of a Steven Spielberg production, yet colorful and partly unpredictable enough to hold interest. Although slightly beyond reality, the theme does suggest a distant possibility and leaves a residue of though relating to todays survival. Perhaps targeted toward an age group, but relative to all. Even if you are a low life peon, from a dirtbag community, but the heart of a champion beats within you, you are a survivor. And with a little luck, from being a good guy, you will prevail. A good message. Not just for the victorious, but all that compete.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|The movie delivers. I'm an ardent fan of the books and feared them being poorly adapted for film, but that wasn't the case. This is a fantastic movie, thoroughly enjoyable for everyone, 8 years old through adults. Very impressive.
1936608898|5.0|I've been on it less than 4 full weeks and have lost 11 lbs.  You won't go hungry and if you follow the plan, you will be eating healthy.<br />I plan to continue for one more month before I add any other food items.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was a little aggravated that the Kindle Fire didn't have an app for Pinterest for a long time.  This app was much needed, and works well.  The only thing I haven't figured out is how to pin from a magazine or a web page to pinterest using this.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I did enjoy most of this movie, all but Jamie Fox's balls... It was kind of weird watching the bad guy from Justified grab a handful of nuts.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think that I actually enjoy this game as much, if not more than the first Iron Man game. Avengers Assemble!!!
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read every one of Mary Higgins Clark's books and have loved them all.  She is one of my favorite authors.  I will continue to read all of her books.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I was trying to download this app but it kept on saying there was a error downloading this app please try again.<br /><br />PLZ DOWNLAD!!!!!!!!
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|I lost my copy and this was replacement and its funny. with all the stuff going on in the world it's great to watch something that makes comedy of it all.
B0097K21YW|5.0|I am not one who got hooked to angry birds! Although this is somewhat the same as far as the aim and destroy, I enjoy this probably more than the few times I did play angry birds!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As most know, the movie is a small excerpt from DKG's book. The details and stories about Lincoln and his contemporaries are brought to life with great detail. Have read other books on Lincoln, but this one tops them all. Truly, fascinating. Wish he was here, now.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I don't understand the need to constantly use profanity in movies!  This movie would not have been rated R were it not for the constant and annoying use of the &#34;F&#34; word.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Just what I wanted for our Disney trip!  Something to hold a couple drinks and a place to put my phone.<br />It fit perfect on our Bumbleride Indie stroller. Well, I cant imagine that it wouldnt fit fine on ANY kind of stroller.<br />The way it straps on makes it pretty universal.  The drink compartments are elastic material so they will stretch to fit pretty big drinks. And the zipper compartment was the perfect size for an iphone 5, some loose $1's and disney passes, or whatever you might wanna stick in there.  : )
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is an excellent story teller with the ability to transport you between past and present.  Her characters are interesting people, who you'll want to know more about as the story unfolds. After reading The Secret Keeper, you'll believe in second chances, but you'll know that all those chances come with the weight of having to bear secrets.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|nice story of choice of becoming good or evil and happy or alone. fresh characters. actors were all good in their parts.looking forward to sequel.i have over 500 movies easy, and this movie is  a nice addition.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series is excellent and I would recommend them to anyone.  We have been very happy with them.  Thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book, there is no way the movie will ever compare to this read!!!!  Edge of your seat deception from start to finish!
193700788X|2.0|If this had been just another Sookie Stackhouse novel, it would have been a missable, passable entry in the series. Skippable, certainly. However, since it's the final book, it's suddenly elevated to the spotlight and becomes much more important, and this is where I felt it under-performed.<br /><br />I know it's got some very bad reviews elsewhere, but this isn't a bad book. It's well written, it has some fun moments, and it rolls along at a decent pace. Unfortunately, I was expecting something better to end the series. It needed to step things up a gear, and it needed to walk that delicate line between giving fans what they want, and still having a few surprises. When the book was over, I just felt that it was a damp squib and a missed opportunity. This is made even more frustrating by the fact that Charlaine Harris has shown time and again that she's a great author, so it's especially disappointing that one of her few misses turned out to be one of her most hotly anticipated books.
B0063M22QO|4.0|keeps me and my kids (7 &amp; 4) busy. Great for them to work on matching. They like to play the same games as the adults.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book!!!!!! Once again, Vince Flynn knocks it out of the park!!! I will always love Transfer of Power but this one was great too!!!!!
B008602KQI|3.0|Not really my type of movie. I almost turned it off but, then it picked up a little. Good for one time.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|My wife loved this series very much.  It is very well acted and the story line is very good. Thank you.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have stuck around the series since HBO's True Blood enjoying the differences in the books and the series as it was an interesting turn of creativity from both teams. I have heard and read many comments of those disappointed with the book ending, but to be completely honest and not spoil for those that haven't read it yet - it is a pretty logical one. And geez, it's just a book. Get over it. Charlaine Harris has been working on it for a really long time and I understand her readiness to work on something new. I am actually looking forward to it.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|This movie was so touching and I was unaware that it was based on a true story until the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes romance chick flicks that are based on a true drama. It was a perfect mix of both. The acting was excellent but with Rachel and Channing who would expect less..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I first got this game, it was a little bit overwhelming.  Now it's more than just turning, jumping and ducking.  You ride in carts and slide down ropes, and the road has hills and turns.  It took a while to get used to after playing the original, but I think its a lot more fun.  I really love playing and would definitely recommend it.
B001NOQI3U|3.0|This has great POW behind it:  graphic appeal, authentic setting, truly commendable acting, intriguing storyline--but something is never quite right.  It may be the continual breaking in of Streisand singing her thoughts in an endless train of tunes that sound much like each other.  Also, there is a turn in the plot that is nerve-wracking and frankly, unbelievable.  Interesting window on a turn-of-the-century European Jewish community, though.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Loved everything about the content and acting. I enjoyed the changes they made in the screen play vs the book. Ithis is one of the only movies I enjoyed as much or better than the book.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love this show and I love the music. So glad I purchased this. I am enjoying it very much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I sat glued to this season almost all the way through in entirety !! Video quality was very good - The only drawback is having to wait on season 4.  Can't wait to see what it has in store for the Granthams.
0141345659|5.0|This book trusts the reader and lets the narrator tell life like it is not like we pretend it is. Its well written and beautifully paced. I truly enjoyed the story and the characters. I highly recommend this book. Loved it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|paid over 100 dollars for another camera backpack and found this one which was like the million dollar man :} , better , easier , lighter and with more internal options. Re-gifted the other one . Wish this one came in colors as I would buy another one in a flash.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game I ever played.I just got it last week and its amazing. you should get it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game. Great graphics and a good time killer. Relaxing and fun at the<br /><br />same time. That's why I give it five stars.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|The headline pretty much says it. Richard Dawkins, the leading atheist of our time, sometimes is difficult to read. Nevertheless, it is a necessary read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful bible so.  Highly recommend t o anyone look I my for a goodnight b or app.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Refreshingly different, unique effects, catchy tunes. Little Black Submarines is one of those songs you can easily get stuck in your head.  Lonely Boys was played live at the last Grammy's and also left an impression on me. Worth checking out.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Years ago I saw Gandhi in a theater and was impressed with the film then.  Watching it in HD on my new Kindle Fire was an even more inspiring experience since my life experience has been considerably broadened since my first viewing.  The acting, screenplay, and photography are all top rate.  It was also very clear how influenced Martin Luther King was by Gandhi's non-violent approach just as it was very evident that Jesus Christ's non-violent resistance profoundly influenced Gandhi.  Also coming across clearly was what happens in a country when the ruling power that helps maintain order among disparate groups ceases to exercise control.  This is a pattern seen repeatedly not only in India but more recently in Iraq, Egypt, and now Syria.  And regrettably, the film reminds us of the pattern of courageous leaders being assassinated by those unable to deal with the significant and positive changes instigated by these leaders.  This film is a must-see for anyone interested in how individual leaders can be great forces for good.  Too often we get focused on the &#34;bad guys&#34; (Hitler, Stalin, etc.) and forget that there have been and will continue to be great leaders who move the world forward toward a more humane and loving place. Robert Richard
1451695187|4.0|Good book but not totally satisfying...which I guess is part of the mystery of death. Worth reading nonetheless. An easy and fun read.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is really awesome if you're an Iron Man fan like me. Its fun because your flying and then you have to destroy enemies. The only down side, its basically temple run, but instead of running you're flying. I was expecting something different, but all in all, its an awesome game that Iron Maners should get if they just love Iron Man and Tony Stark.
B0037YOMWS|1.0|What a piece of junk. Within 2 weeks the number 7 button broke rendering the calculator useless. It is also extremely difficult to use as the instruction booklet included with the instrument presents only the very simple starting concepts.
0634022296|5.0|The chords are as they are in the original songs, not just approximately like in other songbooks, or in other keys. Now I can really play the Beatles!
B0049JPU8A|5.0|The script. i have no words for them. They sing their songs straight from their souls. Favorite song from this album? walk away
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|,ROCKIN,AWESOME,AMAZING,SPECTACULAR,DEFINITE 5 STAR, BEST It is amazingly awesome. Cool and once again SPECTACULAR. . It couldn't be better than ever
B000I0QL82|5.0|Bought this for my Grandpa for his Birthday!!!!! He loved it, one of his favorite movies.<br /><br />Was in impressed with the tracking , actual date of delivery and the service.<br /><br />Thank you, Robin Looker
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I had skipped over this film several times because I didn't think I would really like it.  Was I wrong!!  This is a great movie.  I will enjoy watching it again.
B0015KGWZG|5.0|I read this book more than twenty years ago in the Spanish version. It has helped me to have a better life now because I am improving my English I am reading  the English version and I am a kind of rediscovering it. Very good book for self-help.
1400069807|5.0|I saw an interview with Michael Moss on a morning news show, and thought this book would be good to read as motivation for healthier eating.  The information in this book shows the link between the growth of the processed food industry and the obesity problem - very eye opening.
B002ASVYPU|5.0|They are amazing! It's hard to find bands now a days that sing songs that make you feel the passion and emotion in their voices. They are simply phenomenal
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I think it is very useful, because if you need to check something whenever you don't have it.You can use this
0385349947|5.0|In April 2013, I attended a forum at work targeted toward women in the workplace. Sheryl Sandberg's TED talk \\"Why We Have Too Few Women Leaders\\" was presented and then there was a panel of accomplished women that gave answers to a list of questions geared at sharing their experiences and giving advice. I had also read about this book on the Huffington Post and since I needed to read a book for an applied principles of management class, I decided to read this book because the topic is near and dear and because I was going to read this book anyway, assignment or no assignment.<br /><br />The stories that Sheryl shares in this book reveal our ingrained collective psyche regarding the division of roles between men and women at the most basic level. She points out things that we all know, but maybe never gave any conscious thought to. I cannot say with enough emphasis how important it is for our world to have women's voices heard. This book has brought out the feminist in me. I wholeheartedly agree with Sheryl's opinions and suggestions.<br /><br />Even today, after the women's liberation and equal rights movements, it is still a man's world that women are trying to break into. With so few women in top leadership positions, it's no wonder the world is in such a state of discontent and aggression. I hope this book's message reaches everyone because it is a message worth spreading. This book identifies the core behaviors and attitudes that hold women back.<br /><br />While this book didn't address single parenting and what impact that has on women, its likely that it's because Sheryl doesn't have first hand experience with that. However, I do and I can tell you that this book has given me a great deal to think about and ideas of how I can promote change. I also purchased the audible version of this book which has an excellent narration. I have 2 daughters, 19yrs and 22 yrs, that I raised as a single parent since they were 3.5yrs and 7yrs. They have watched Sheryl's TED talk which is basically a quick summary of the book and I will do whatever it takes to make sure they either read the book or listen to the audible version. I want my daughter's to have this knowledge and be influenced by it throughout their lives.<br /><br />Like I mentioned in the heading, I truly believe this book should be required reading in high school and if not there then one of the required courses for any degree program in the country, just like English, Math, Intro to Sociology, Intro to Psychology, etc... The world would be a better place if we all took a step back and internalized Sheryl's message.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough, aside from the fact that it is highly relevant, it is told with humor, humility, and honesty.<br />Thank you for leaning in and writing this book, Sheryl!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Everything was good and on time. It´s wonderful when you recived everything on time and was exactly the same product you bought
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and so worth the 7 dollars. My friends and I all love it. You HAVE to get it..
1476734941|5.0|We saw Michael Mosley's documentary, &#34;Eat, Fast, and Live Longer with Michael Mosley&#34; on PBS, and it started us thinking about how fasting twice a week is a sensible way to lose weight and be healthier.  This book reiterates a lot of the information provided in the documentary, but also gives more detail on how to effectively incorporate fasting into your weekly regimen. My husband and I have been fasting twice a week for 3 weeks now, and both of us are seeing excellent results - an average of one pound lost per fast.  It is not nearly as hard to do as we thought.  You can eat up to 500 calories (600 for men) on a fast day if necessary, and this book provides examples of what would be good to eat at those times.<br /><br />This book and the documentary are based on Micheal's personal quest to get healthy and stay healthy for as long as possible.  If that is your goal, then this book is well worth the investment.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I set my timer for an hour. it helps me to relax and clears my mind.  I would be lost without this app at bedtime.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I love how you can change between American and Japanese soundtracks, and how once you beat it you get to play as tails.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Great action, sophisticated dram, definitely an attention grabber.  Tom Cruise took me to another place with this movie by portraying himself as a good/bad character.  For good, but above the law that he upholds
B00005JMCW|5.0|I enjoy this movie because it reminds myself how difficult it was as a child.  Gives me insight to my own daughter's life.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I had to unload the game then reload it after it stopped working but my sons love it so I guess its ok.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|We really love Fringe.  it always keeps us on the edge of our seats wondering what's going to happen next.  Usually when we think we have it figured out, something unexpected happens.
014241493X|5.0|My daughter read this first and said it was great. She loved all but the ending which she said was disappointing
B004QSQML8|4.0|People who can't figure out that this disc comes with two movies really shouldn't be using cars, electronics, etc. The transfer of the movie, picturw wise, is sufficient on the theatrical version. You can tell scott views that as his bastard version of the movie. I prefer it because i am a fan of Tangerine Dream. The audio transfer is very good. So happy they did this version in master after leaving it in stereo on the regular dvd some years back.  If you are a fan get it and enjoy it and its new glorious version.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Even though it did not have as much gusto as the 900, doing research on the 700 and 900 I found that this flash performed much better in the category of overheating. This flash will go forever with no overheating problems, with the remote capabilities it has I found that it suit my needs as well or better than the 900. I highly recommend this flash.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Daughter bought this for a friend..  I believe they both have watched it many times..  They say it is a must have.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really useful app.  Works well with Kindle Fire.  Good to see how much battery is left and handy to see the time left for different processes, i.e. videos, music etc.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I began watching Glee in Season 2, so it was great to go back and watch the first season.  Love the series :)
B005HSL626|3.0|I downloaded this for my step daughter who was board at a family event and I open it occasionally and play it. I am not as good at it as she is.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|DM just keeps growing and their sound evolves constantly. It is a bit bluesy and laid back. Not what a lot of people expect. It is what makes them awesome. Means you won't hear the same song over again.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|it's a radical new way for pitch and I require a new whole new mind set for manage the way of proceed, it's clear and require a lot of practice and preparation before you cuold able to handle well, I recommend it
0143122916|4.0|I have always wanted a peak into what is going on in North Korea (perhaps a vacation in Pyonyang?)  This was a better and safer alternative...
193700788X|1.0|This is the first time I've ever felt the urge to review a book. It was abysmal and made no sense. Eric who consistently manipulated other and looked out for his own interests of the thousands of years hes been alive just can be bothered to even attempt to make a plan, and just relies on Sookie to use magic to solve there problems. Eric being forced to be the queens consort makes no sense either, consorts are actually supposed to like their monarchs (just look at Sophie-anne and Andre.) It  irritated extreme that there has been time in this series to go on long descriptions about food preparation or shopping trips but a page to talk about the end of her relationship. Also SAM, why? She'd know him for years, shes dated most other available supes and has shown little interest in him, oh well better have sex with him and spend the rest of your life with him in the last 20 pages. Also why did she need to go to prison, the police had no evidence so how could they prosecute her. So glad this series is over and that by making Eric horrible and spiteful at the end I can now not enjoy any of the previous books.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|Contact was a very good movie.I like most scifi  movies.It held my interest through out the entire movie.I wpuld recommend it as a movie to watch.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I cannot give this book a review as it did not download onto my tablet!  I have the kindle app and I have been charged, but I have not received it.  It's happened before so not sure if my tablet is at fault?!
B00B4804KS|5.0|By far the best 3D conversion ever. The attention to detail is in every scene. The T-Rex scene is maybe even more thrilling than the first time I saw it. Even Sam L's cigeartte is perfect.<br />When T-Rex roars at Dr. Grant, I shivered. The teeth were poised.It's throat was like a gateway to hell.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I've streamed ALL the seasons of Dexter . I'm about midway through season 7 as of this writing . I never tire of this show and it's titular character . Each season a long form cliffhanger . Each episode a short one . Just wanted to vote and encourage folks to check it out . Good to see Tom hank's son and Mr. Olmos in this exciting sixth season . Check out the show if you have not already . An odd , great time . Always .
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Only seeing this band once live back in 2011, I was impressed with their sound but wasn't in a rush to buy an album.  However, now with this latest release, they have evolved to an even better than expected level.  The elements of a great rock sound are present in each song, especially with the riffs and solos, one can appreciate the technical work that went into the songs.  The underlying theme of the album is a wonderful touch, reminiscent of the storytelling concept once done by the late great Ronnie James Dio on the Magica album.  Black Veil Brides have certainly given one impressive effort here and I look forward to seeing them live, this time as not as an amused observer, but as a fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is definitely a five star book. It had a great story line. Love. Action. Everything. Definitely recommend. Without a doubt.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have been a fan since I read the Hobbit in the early 70's. I think they did a great job.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What can I say, J. R. R. Tolken's books are the best I've ever read and now Peter Jackson has done a masterful job recreating them in movies.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really liked this novel and, for the most part, it was well written.  I never found it boring, and I couldn't stop turning the pages.  The only thing I found annoying was the switching back and forth from Sookie's first-person point of view to third person.  I think the story could have been told without doing that.  It was distracting, not in keeping with the previous books of the series, and took me out of the story.  That is the only reason I'm not giving the novel five stars.<br /><br />****Spoiler Alert for the following****<br /><br />I can understand the anger some have because the vamps didn't have a big role in this book and CH didn't spend a lot of time finishing the relationship between Eric and Sookie, but I can see why Harris had to do it that way to pave the way for the guy Sookie eventually chose.  I was sad to say good-bye to the vamps, but it had to be done.  And, really, if you think about it, the time Eric or Bill would have had to spend with Sookie, as long as she stayed human, was just a blip on the radar screen for them.  I thought it was in character that Eric chose Freyda.  He was a pragmatist and loved power.  He never would have given that up for a paltry 20 or 30 years with Sookie, no matter how much he loved her.  And Sookie never would have willingly let herself be turned.  In the end, she would always be a child of the sun.
B000JCSBU0|1.0|No plot, no acting, dark-dark-dark.  If you are not in a good mood to begin with, you will be in a worse mood afterwards.  Got through 40 minutes and had to turn off.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|One of tv's better shows. Good cast, excellent show. The cast can make you feel the drama and the action
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I grew up with many different film versions, but never read the actual book until today I downloaded it on Kindle about four hours ago and have been unable to put it down since. This truly always has been and will be a genuine classic!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Engaging, intelligent drama. The regular cast is superb...but keep an eye out for first-rate, recurring character actors. A true gem.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Absolutely wonderful as you follow the life of Ender Wiggin as his potential is brought forth through hard work and the bending of teachers.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Some of the episodes locked up, other than that the shows were extremely good.  I am a Star Trek fan
B00BF11UM0|1.0|not at all what i expected  zero action IMO very boring to me and an utter disappointment the cool title lured me in and that was the last of the coolness in went downhill fast and was very hard to keep watching kinda like watching grass grow
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun good for family so I enjoy it  my kids to so thanks a lot for having the time to make this amazing game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Okay but they always try to make you buy stuff on it but good game though. Not the best app.
B002ZG9800|5.0|Jim Carrey is perfect as the con man in love. Ewan McGregor once again easily slips into a character that you are ready to embrace. This is based on a true story. Forget all the hilarity, and enjoy the charming and wild tale of a man desperately in love.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Wow I've loved this game since the 80's and still going strong, this game brings me back to the old days.
B0097K21YW|4.0|My sone thinks the monster is Godzilla and he loves the game.  I did not mind buying it since it was free.  I live on a tight budget so this was a good choice.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Engaging story of the relationship between 2 people. The music was a perfect match! Love the fact that its based on a true story too.
B008M721MS|4.0|I like it because we can video chat with friends.<br />It helps me remember people on Facebook I haven't seen for a year
B004H1V5RU|5.0|the entire devise is SUPER well made, rolling the marbel in the peice goes on both sides of each &#34;track&#34; making a total of 125 turns in it. its kept my attention for Quite some time and still pick it up from time to time. I have left it on my bookself and its a great piece for people to look out,
B002VECMAE|5.0|This story based on real occurrences holds its own in the tradition of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and such. Clooney, Spacey, and Bridges are a scream. Ewan McGregor as the long-suffering and later enlightened reporter is a joy to watch as he takes this trip down the rabbit hole! This will particularly resonate with those who partied throughout the 60's and 70's. May the Farce be with you.<br /><br />Sorry, I couldn't resist the Obi-wan reference!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|We enjoyed this movie very much. Action packed and a great movie to watch. Thank you very much. Enjoy it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I've only had this for two days and I am hooked entirely on it!!! Not only is it an improvement of the 3rd,but it is one of the most amazing rpgs I have ever played for tablet!!<br />I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a good dungeon crawl
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is very User friendly  and a well thought out app. It is just what I was looking for.  Thanks go to the developers.
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|I loved this booked. But I dint know if it was just me but I predicted its as I went on. Which was okay cuz I still cried. &lt;3
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Its a game that actually requires you to think. My cousin recommended it to me, I like it, but I have yet to destroy the human race :(<br /> I need to get a better strategy.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel. The ensemble casting was just right.  Great stress reliever when you just got to see something get blown up and the good guys win!
0142402532|5.0|Story of Matilda is inspiring - highlights determination, self-reliance and courage in adverse times, and shows the impact of self-education through reading!
0061245097|5.0|This series is awesome. Start from the beginning so you don't get confused. Awesome book and you won't want to put it down.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it its fun....but everything I build is gone once I get on my server! I give it a 4. star u should buy it
B005JE1KFG|5.0|Could not put the book down well above average writer. Kept you involved from start to finish Suitable for all ages.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The format of the story flip flopped between past and present. I learned the many meaning flowers have. I learned that in the past, people gave flowers to say something. I always thought a bouquet of flowers was more about the gesture and never thought to read into what those flowers would mean. The story was intense and I found myself frustrated from time to time. I think this book engaged me as a reader. It was a book club pick that a group of us read. We all enjoyed it and you will too.
B0062P3392|5.0|I remember the original movie starring James Caan. This one took a different view of the storyline, and was worth every penny.  Both versions are worth watching!
193700788X|1.0|After following this series from the beginning I feel so disappointed in this book. So many people in and out and not really making it come together. I am just utterly disappointed.I loved Eric and Sookie together and she made Eric so pathetic in this book. It was like everyone had to come make an appearance in this. I hated what the TV series did to the characters and I don't watch it but this is the last book was worse I will not buy any more books by Miss Harris.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's a PS3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller.  It showed up quickly and it works just as it is supposed to.  I like the way it fits in my hands, and it has great battery life.
B009NY43NY|4.0|While it's not my favorite book in the series I thought it ended like it should. I just don't see how it could have ended happily any other way. I feel that the people that are disappointed are disappointed because it didn't end how they thought it should. Well, it wasn't their story...It was Charlaine's and we just got to go along on the wonderful ride.
B005JE1JZC|5.0|Found it difficult to put down.Kept you involved from whoa to go.Suited for readers of all ages.Looking forward to next book
193700788X|5.0|I must admit that I hesitated ordering this book because Deadlocked was such a disappointment; I thought it would be impossible for Charlaine Harris to write a satisfying ending to the series. Thankfully Charlain's last Sookie. book is a wonderful ending to a great series.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I've seen The Hunger Games before, but watching it on my Kindle was amazing!! The picture quality was better than I expected. The best thing is you don't have to pause the movie when you leave the room, just take it with you!!
193700788X|1.0|I just can't! That was such bad work all over Charlaine Harris! Shame on you. I want my money back!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I love the way this book was written. Jaycee always made sure you understood everything she wrote making it a book I couldn't put down. I cannot even begin to imagine what this poor girl, now a woman went through. Even reading her story, I am amazed how she survived. This book is heart wrenching and painfully sad yet at the same time uplifting. Jaycee is an inspiring woman who has come so far. I hope she succeeds with everything she plans to do with her future. Her and her family deserve so much happiness.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|It was most suspenseful! I could not figure out where Roger was while missing. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical novels. Was hoping Roger & Brianna would go back to the 20th century.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I woul love to watch this on T.V. I never saw this plot coming. My girlfriend passed this on to me and swore I wouldn't put it down and she was right! Besides my husband complaining for keeping the bed stand light on it was a fabulous read. I so highly recommend this. Hope for a series's...
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Did not care for this game. Not much of a game really, too slow. Maybe a kids game.<br />I have deleted it from my kindle.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|First of all, I didn't read the book. When I heard about all of the great reviews I had to watch it for myself. I really enjoyed everything about this movie. I loved all of the characters and really enjoyed the comedic timing. This is a movie that really makes you feel good after watching it.
B000001FHV|5.0|Other than with the song &#34;Backwater&#34;, this band went highly unnoticed.  &#34;Backwater&#34; is included on this album as well as the hidden track &#34;Lake of Fire&#34;, which Nirvana covered at their unplugged show.  Loaded with other good songs, this album album features excellent songwriting and musicianship, particularly by songwriter/guitarist Curt Kirkwood.  It's a highly recommendable piece of 90's rock.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was looking for something worth my time and effort.  This is definitely not one of those games or puzzles that leaves you wishing you hadn't spent your playing. Thanks for making this game. I anxiously await the next series.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love baseball and movies about baseball, but the exploration of  troubled father-daughter relationship makes this worth watching even if you do not like baseball.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I do not understand a single word on this album but it makes me want to learn how to speak and understand French.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My boys love this game!  During the time I give them each day to game, this is the game of choice.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I read several reviews that only gave this game only 3 stars because the description says you can use real money for in game purchases. I just beat the game and not once was I prompted in any way to use real money. So I'm assuming people didn't bother actually playing the game before writing their reviews.<br />This game was a lot of fun, and not too challenging. It's a time management game where your trying to get from point A to point B while removing the various obstacles in your way. I had a lot of fun.<br />Works great on a Kindle Fire and doesn't need a constant Internet connection.<br />The only problem I have with it, is it's pretty short. I beat it in 2 days of casual play.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|i didnt expect to have all that bass shaking my house.  It's different then what they had produced before, and i love it :D  I need to buy a stronger subwoofer to enjoy it better!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app!!!!!! It is so much fun!!!! I love horses so that makes this app even more interesting for me!!!!! I would highly recommend trying this app!!!!!
0894803123|5.0|It's Ben and Jerry's - what's not to like.  Recipes are easy and adaptable.  It's become my go to ice cream recipe book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Watch it...you will like it. Personally I think this series has roots in Robert Heinlein's sci-fi books, particularly Citizen of the Galaxy. If you want to think the future will be gritty, not antiseptic, like Star Trek, then this is a good series for you. Only downer...they didn't make more episodes.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was my first time reading a  book by Gillian Flynn - and it won't be my last!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because I figured out the ending  half way through the book.  Highly recommend!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I honestly don't understand what everyone is whining about! I really enjoyed this final book in the series. I'm going to miss these characters so much! If you've truly enjoyed and appreciated the previous books, you will probably like this one too. And thank you to Charlaine Harris for sharing these characters and their stories with us- I can't wait to read the follow-up this fall!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is an incredible writer, comedy (30 Rock), or otherwise. This book is a nice fun read without all of the  Hollywood drama. It is written in such a way that feels like a conversation with a life long friend.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun. My friend has it and I tried it and loved it. There would be a daily reward for dozer dollars.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love the big numbers and integers. I'm not a rocket scientist.Ok.I use it in the grocery store.to figure out weights in grams. Ah the curse of the metric system.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The special features on the extra disk are awesome. I've watching it over a dozen times. A good buy.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|You must enjoy British movies or shows to really enjoy it. Brits are very \\"dry\\". I love it. Accents can be hard to understand.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I already knew it would be a great book to read since I had heard stories about Tony Hsieh's work, and of course Zappos' success is legendary. The book did not disappoint. It's truly inspiring and helped me to see the path he took to achieve what he did. I am always striving to improve myself and my business, and this book puts so many things in perspective in a wonderful, clear and simple way.
157421327X|3.0|A little sketchy in the content. Too small for the price. I would have liked more pages of ideas and exercises
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome!!! I definately recommend it.  It's  really easy and there are a lot of character choices. BEST APP EVER!!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I love the Godfather.  Great collection.  I only wish the italian subtitles were in english.  You can change them using CC, but then you see everything they speak, even in english!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Should not have been removed from nbc line up.  Good cohesive episode  did not find the subject matter offensive but ib  am a rational person  not from boston or sandy hook
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is the most awesome game ever it's much better than trample run for reasons 1.you can fly and 2.it's just like the movie
B0094BB4TW|5.0|App works as desired. One thing that does not work as desired is the regular requests for review by Amazon.  Occasionally I would prefer to provide a star rating without comment, an unavailable choice.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I'm not only a Dave Grohl fan, I'm a music fan and this movie describes how great musicians put music together.  I could watch this everyday.
B007NESBK2|4.0|I've seen this presentation on TV a couple of times, and the Blu-ray is better.  But the picture clarity is lacking in definition and the sound could have been tweaked more.  It is a great performance by a great performer and her band is second to none.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable concert and the extras are entertaining.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|2 stars, low estimation? why? because...<br /><br />I can't get anything from this book.<br />Steve Jobs is very outstanding.But I don't wanna be a person like him.<br /><br />I don't like geek!
B005HSL626|4.0|Love this game, tons of fun, would have given 5 stars but my husband gets obsessed with beating his top score and runs down the battery.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|Great app. However  I need help with password.<br />Also I would also like page tabs,<br />Tab indenting.  Otherwise, I'm a happy camper.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Life of Pi is one of my all time favorite books, and I felt the movie did justice to the book.  If you have seen the movie, but not read the book, read the book!  It is one of the best written and a clever read.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I had to help my daughter with one of her levels and got instantly addicted. I downloaded it to my kindle and had to go through every level. This is a good fun game that is appropriate for any age or gender.
B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|I started watching this show to fill the void created when I had watched all available Star Trek shows. It is interesting enough that I have kept watching so far, but no promises how much longer it can keep me as a viewer.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I liked this version of Persuasion very much and would have given it 5 stars except for Mr. Hind's most unfortunate mouth and double chin which is very unattractive and distracting. I just have never been able to think of him as a romantic lead. He just lacks the right look.  Other than that, it is well cast and stays pretty close to the book. The role of Anne requires an actress who can look both plain and depressed then switch to being very pretty and bright looking and I found all this in this movie. But, alas, she needed a better Capt. Wentworth.
0765325950|1.0|Very disappointing ending of the oh so good series. No character development; abundant loose endings. What happened to Moirane, what happened to the Aes Sedai, what happened to all other characters ? A totally confused battle narrative, and Rand's role was noting, but words, words and words; hard to understand. I wish I would never have read this ending of the series; it should be re-written
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best series on tv.i have watched it twice and cant get enough. Clean, intriguing , and well acted. Must see.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|Stupid movie about stupid people doing stupid things.  I couldn't even finish it.she was such a neurotic wench.  Don't watch
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest! I like this because I can scan pinterest at work on my kindle fire rather than my 3” phone screen. My one and only complaint would be that when first enlarging a pin the picture either won’t show up or will be cut in half. I found the fix for this though is just to close that pin and open it a second time- almost always enlarges normally then! Happy pinning!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln presented a unique perspective of the way business was done and is being done--some of the time in Washington
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I use for school. Taking notes writing ideas for papered and then email to self so I can open il in word.
B008MBXFEM|5.0|Truly amazing, I get the chills when I listen to this....amazing, this is the best action movie soundtrack ever, yet it did not get one single award, not one!!!<br />Hanz was robbed, period...but then again, the Oscars are a joke, the Academy is a sham...<br />History will value this soundtrack as one of the best ever...<br />You will not regret buying it!!!
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Was very boring and! dry.  the movie was hard to get into.  Unless you are very into history, you wont like it
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie was great! But maybe we liked it because it played to our dry sense of humor and &#34;say what you think&#34; personalities!<br />Great acting!<br />Great story line!<br />We loved it!! Not just an ordinary girls date night movie - plenty of sass for everyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I’m up to level 7 and have only had 2-3 that I had to really think about but my 7yr old has this as well and it is difficult enough to keep her interested.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|The perspective of the time and the adventure put forth make this a great viewing experience for all ages, young and old
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, great season.  I recommend this sow to anyone who will listen.  I have read the comics and honestly like the show much better than the comics.  Its a really good show.
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|This is the best progressive rock album I have heard so far in 2013.  It is a masterpiece.<br /><br />I almost have no words to describe how good it is.  I was floored the first time I heard it, and I have since listened to it more than 10-times when I discovered it two days ago.  When an album hits me that fast and that hard, it's the beginning of a love affair for me.<br /><br />It mostly follows in the great tradition of classical progressive rock music, with hints of neo-prog and new-age added in.  I myself have been listening to progressive rock since the 70's, and I immediately felt at home with this material.  Don't get me wrong, the music is not rehashed old stuff. The compositions are new and refreshing to my ear.<br /><br />These are the qualities I notice most of all from the album: excellent musicianship, compositional creativity, very good vocals, and heightened aesthetics.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear more stuff from these guys.
0061537934|5.0|I think that everyone should read this book.  It is in my top 5 and the only thing I would suggest is to b alone and out of the public eye when you finish it. Sobbing!!!
B004P4S4NM|3.0|The GOOD songs were great, the rest are s0-s0 and I removed them from my computer. I could have saved myself $5.00 by just buying the particular songs. I REALLY like Adele's popular songs but the rest of the CD was disappointing, all things considered.
B004SDEP38|3.0|It seems to pick and choose which presentations it will open for me. When it does open a powerpoint it works fine though.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The fight for rights, freedom and serving  others is protrayed fromt he epic play of history, a great way to share with the family the need to stand for one's thoughts
B003HE2B6C|5.0|Hanson has always been a great band but they just get better and better with every album.  Highly recommend this!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Moving from Montreal to the gold and diamond rich Canadian North (Yellowknife), the book contains the requisite mystery, murders and local history to compel the reader to keep reading to the end.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Good game, good graphics and good action. The only con is that on shopp many things need to use the diamonds. But even this the game is great.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I started reading this series years ago, and loved it. I would eagerly buy each book and devote myself to reading it straight through. I had been increasingly dissatisfied with the past 3 books CH wrote in this series, but I persevered because I wanted to see it through to the end. Shame on me for hoping!!  I knew who Sookie would end up with, because of an interview CH gave a year or 2 back. However, the way she destroyed her characters and their world was horrible. While I believe that every author has the prerogative to write their novel how they see fit, we as consumers can choose not to support an author in any future endeavors when they massacre a series the way CH did. I, along with most of her former fan base it sounds like, will never again read ANYTHING she writes. It's a shame, because she has so much talent as was demonstrated in the earlier books in this series. However this book was sloppy in so many ways. CH seemed to forget her own characters' traits (hello Sookie and telepathy in regard to Supes) and there were many more ways to get Sookie and Sam together. Those should have been fleshed out better in these past few books. There was a hint of it in one of the pack wars where Sam transformed into a lion to protect Sookie and later Sookie was jealous of the shifter that Sam started dating. Perfect opportunity to explore their relationship CH!!! But of course, that opportunity was missed and she and Eric moved on. Never again was there a hint of romantic feelings on Sookie's side of things.<br /><br />IMO, it almost seemed like CH began hating her characters and it showed in this book. What was done to Eric was just wrong on every level. I knew he would never be with Sookie as CH had stated that, but he could have at least had a happy ending. Being sold into sex slavery, seriously? Why does CH have so much hate for poor Eric?! Not to mention Sookie's turnabout. This is truly a case where either an author didn't care enough to keep track of previous story lines or just didn't care. I'm opting for the latter.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't waste your money on this book. If you have to know how it ends go to the library. You'll just walk away with a sour taste in your mouth, without wasting $15. Better yet, invent your own ending because watching our beloved characters unravel, having previous story lines forgotten, and watching the destruction of what used to the world of Bon Temps is heartbreaking and excruciating.  While CH is upset at fans for lashing out, she's going to be extremely upset when she no longer has any fans for her future books.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading about TIna Fey from her own point of view. It made me laugh out loud at times and I learned a lot about her.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really touched me in ways unimaginable. Charlie's character showed me to take things easy in life, and lose yourself in what you enjoy doing. I recommend this book to everyone who is trying to search for themselves, because you'll find it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I've ever played.whoever wants to give me a great review please say yes or so in spanish.
B006UV8DJS|5.0|This app worked really well for me on my kindle fire. I'm not sure what the bad reviews were about, but i really enjoy tthis app and it is very simple to figure out how to work. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an awesome photo editor app.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|This game sucks!  The longer u play the worse it gets. It's no good for kids or adults. Play it long enough &amp; it makes less &amp; less sense.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|This is art performed by a super-group of musicians. This is perfect mix of jazz fusion and progressive rock. Every song is a story and the lyrics are incredible. There were moments that really tugged on my heart strings. I would recommend this for anyone that has ears. Fantastic!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Glad to find some of the past characters, but sad how things developed with Eric.  Wish I could just go back to book 4. Disappointed in this as I do anticipated this book. No real ending to the series no good bye that make sense to
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|Hated to see it end although it had but loved the series knowing what was going to happen. The last 2 episodes were great.
B00A9V2JSG|2.0|I read the reviews for this book an agree it is a very well written book, but it is to long. The story is good but it needs to move a lot faster. Sorry I know it takes all kinds of books to make the world go round.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I just LOVE this game, but you have to learn patience. Patience, patience, patience! It's very tempting to use pearls to hurry things along but it's a waste of money. Just wait. Go play another game then come back. Use the pearls to get rare plants. Don't bother using real money buying coins and algae, it's easy enough to keep collecting them. Don't hurry the game or you'll get bored because everything is done. Enjoy the reef.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Since I missed the 1st season on Starz in '10, this was great to catch up right along with GOTA.
B0097K21YW|3.0|Next arrow unclickable on Kindle Fire HD. Was able to play for a while but now cannot get back to where I left off.
193700788X|1.0|Chances are if you're here you have just spent the last 2 days reading a hunk of crap... I will spare you the long review.<br /><br />If people still held \\"book burnings\\" I would buy a 100 copies of this to contribute to the flames.<br />THANKS FOR RUINING A GREAT SERIES MS. HARRIS!
B009NY43NY|5.0|As I titled, Miss Charlaine thank you for this wonderful journey!  As to all of these bad reviews?  The vision belongs to the author and shame on you if you didn't get the fact that the last couple of books made the conclusion of the story obvious.  Readers are invited in to share a world and Miss Charlaine certainly gave us one that was rich in character, theme and narration. Since when does the reader have an entitlement to demand the author fulfill their vision?  I for one will miss the good and not so good folk of Bon Temps, Louisiana!<br /><br />Once more a loud Thank you Miss Charlaine!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This is an easy to follow game. The instructions are simple. cute game that entertains. The wonky permission has been removed. In app purchase to buy in game currency.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|travels from area to area, lots of good puzzles, could be more item searches.  well written, good graphics, good audio.  thumbs up
B001O1O71C|3.0|This one wasn't my favorite read but it was worth reading. The friendship between the two boys is remarkable although some other details are kind of unbelievable.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|hands down best book I have ever read. this is a great tribute to people who put there lives on the line to keep this country safe.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great show that I found late (Community and BBT conflicted with each other...Community won).  Amazon allows to me to watch both!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love this game, it is a challenge.  It keeps you thinking late into the ngiht.  I don't like the fact it is timed unless you buy more hearts.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. That's all that needs to be said. I would definitely recommend this book to just about anyone who enjoys reading.
B003204MQS|5.0|Excellent movie.  I felt that they weren't acting but it was actually happening to them!  I had to watch it during the day!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Long Scenes where you know something is coming but you do not know when or what. This Never gets old!
B00BZOD63S|3.0|Ok movie.  Not great, not bad, but just fine as is.  Creepy as all hell, though, so watch out for the kids running around on all fours!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Game is fine but we just got ripped off trying to buy a \\"scoop of gems\\" for $2. The gems never appeared and there is no way to get a refund from Amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome start to what seems to be an amazing trilogy. Can't wait to get started on the next one. Definitely recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I watched this movie and didn't know what I could think about the book. I love it! If you don't read this book you won't know how great it is
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked.  Can't wait for more.  This is an excellent series.  I enjoy owning it because I can watch it again and again until the next season is released.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love this show.  I have been addicted to it for years, and even as characters leave and return, it never gets old.  I tried the spinoff, and it sucked.  Actors trying too hard make it seem cheesy.
0061950726|5.0|I have been reading the books that Target designates for its book club.  I wanted to go outside of my box and read a variety of genres.  All of Target's books so far have been very good, especially this one.  It was a fast read, and a book I could not put down.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|amazing series, very well written. fantastic story lines and keeps you up till the wee hours of the morning binge watching..enjoy!!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is one of the most awesome apps in the app store it is totally worth one dollar you must get it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wonderful game! So glad I found it! My children love it and they sit quietly and play together as a team. Great bonding time for them!!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|The graphics are outstanding, use on the Kindle Fire HD and the longer you play the more challenging it gets. Worth the $1.99
B0063IH60K|3.0|Nice game,runs OK but TOO many polyps!!!!! Good graphics and quick card play with only single tap. Options allow different type of play.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|Loved the first album and love this one. More Trent on this one and with the announcement that NIN is touring again, what else could you ask for besides another NIN release.
B0097K21YW|5.0|From the reviews, I did not expect much, but the game is actually quite good. Graphics are good. Control is decent. Challenge is there, not too difficult, yet not always easy. I compulsively played through the first section (night) totally engrossed. So yeah, I'll give it 5 stars for grabbing and keeping my attention.
B00004NKEO|5.0|So raw it hurts!!!!<br />Love the whole groove of it!<br />A timeless record, that you'll never grow tired of<br />Hail Mary
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|The graphics are nice and is cute, but not much of a challenge.  I think kids would really enjoy it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Although the plot was a bit predictable, the story itself along with the historical background were rewarding.  A pretty good read.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Cute story. It was an easy read I enjoyed immensely. Good for all ages to read or be read to.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|You'll either love this movie or hate it.  I personally enjoy every minute of it.  I especially love the ending!  I wish I could rewrite history and change the real ending to the ending in Inglourious Basterds!  The acting is fabulous.  There are some pretty tense scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat!  Love this movie!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I thought this game was the best build your own park games I've ever played. I wish that the dollars and dinosaurs would cost a lot less.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|....lame movie.  Lots of potential, but still managed to stink.  Still, I do love me some Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
1107699894|5.0|it is very good book.i like the colour it is beautiful.i love it.it is one of the kind i have been looking and now found it.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I read this book because many of my female students love this series. It took me a few tries to get into it, but I enjoyed it once I finished it. This book probably won't change your life or challenge your thinking, but it was a nice easy read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not too bad of a game so far.<br />It is a good way to waste some time.<br />I would recommend it if you like hidden object, mystery games
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is an all time favorite.  The creators of this particular app has done a great job.  Good job.  I play this game on my Kindle Fire everyday.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The whole series has captivated me from the first chapter all the way the last chapter in the book. On the edge of your seat reading.
B00746O3X8|3.0|I really like this harness. It is a very efficient way to carry your gear with you. The only thing that I don't like is that the screw-on mount that goes onto the camera body comes off easily. I contacted to manufacturer to get a replacement and it was close to $10 for the screw.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I needed an internet provider and decided to use Yahoo.  I had a bit of a problem finding what I needed and realized it had to be operator error.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is one of those games that you build on and gain powers. Just started playing so no real info on glitches but can't put it down hooked from the git go. Will look at the one that you pay for.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the game its start out easy then it gets real hard.I have it on my i pad and my kindle.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Brilliant, two bad there is not a fourth book in the series, but the series is good enough with just three books. It's fascinating.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Truly terrible ending to a series. Granted, the last book or 2 have gone downhill, but this one isn't worth the time or the money. Save yourself some real disappointment and let your immagination end the series.
160774273X|5.0|A great book explaining principles clearly, quite readable. Easy to follow techniques and if you follow the direction the stuff works. The key is for me was the &#34;bakers percentage&#34;, which has solved a lot of my missteps. Good pictures taking you step by step through the process.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it so much I think you should read<br />I love how it is so funny can't wait for the next book to come out.
B0024FADDI|5.0|One of my fav movies!  If you have never seen it, it is a little out there, but for any fan of the Evil Dead series, this one takes the cake!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not think she expected to go into the arena one more time. That must've been a surprise to everyone.
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|Blu-ray is the typical Criterion excellence keeping in mind the starting point of a 1950 Japanese B&W with mediocre fidelity monaural audio. Has some good extras including an in depth analysis commentary that provides deep insight about the story, script writing, cinematography and directing within the context of traditional Japanese culture. Options include Japanese or dubbed English dialog (both mono), and English subtitles. It's interesting to watch with dubbed English and subtitles as they are clearly different translations. Found using both together that it provides additional insight into the more subtle meaning of the Japanese dialog.<br /><br />Roshamon is not an original screenplay, it is an adaptation of two Akutagawa short stories, &#34;Roshmon&#34; providing the story-telling setting and infant scene, and &#34;In a Grove&#34; providing the plot and charcters. Even without the optional analysis commentary, it becomes clear within the first 20 minutes or so this is not a Kurosawa action film. It is intellectual and challenges the viewer's concepts about absolute Truth and reality. It is a mental exercise as the priest and the woodsman relate their story about a crime and trial they recently saw to a third party who is curious, wanting to be entertained while waiting out a torrential rainstorm in the shelter of the Rashomon Gate.  The priest in particular is losing his faith and belief in the basic Goodness of humanity after hearing the very different and self-serving testimony at the trial. The basic facts that a rape and murder occurred are not disputed, but who committed the murder and how both were carried out are what substantially differ in five different versions of the events (woodsman with original and later revised stories, notorious bandit on trial, murdered samurai via a &#34;medium, and samurai's wife who was raped by the bandit). It's an absolutely outstanding exploration of Truth, what it is, and how it relates to what people perceive, remember and want or wish to believe. Add to it strong probability of ulterior motives and self-interest tainting the testimony. The themes are universal and timeless, and Kurasowa's portrayal of the story allows the film to be readily understood in nearly any country/culture, 60+ years later. It is cited by some as Japan's &#34;Citizen Kane,&#34; their all-time greatest film with groundbreaking flashback-driven screenplay, directing, acting and cinematography (albeit a much different plot). Not surprising to me that Roshamon received the 1952 Academy Award (Oscar) for Best Foreign Language Film, and has withstood the test of time, continuing to place high on lists of the best Japanese films.<br /><br />Like two other Kurosawa films that were remade as Westerns, &#34;The Outrage&#34; in 1964 with Paul Newman, Edward G. Robinson and a very young Willim Shatner very closely follows Roshamon (with Kurosawa credited for the screenplay. The other two are Seven Samurai / Magnificent Seven and Yojimbo / Fistful of Dollars. Other films use major elements or the same themes more abstractly, but analysis shows the source.<br /><br />This is a film well worth seeing, more than once as the finer details in the story and Kurosawa's directing become more apparentt or wish to believe.

B008Y79IUE|4.0|I had seen it years ago and had forgotten. I didn't watch it this time around. I recalled how depressing it was to see the elderly being taken advantage of. The acting is superb.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I liked it at first, but the puzzles are the same unless you upgrade to another version. After a while it stop working when I did not upgrade.
B003719G40|3.0|So many young people have a hard time when the &#34;bloom is off of the rose&#34; or the newness is overtaken by the realities of living together. Learning to talk each others' love language could be most helpful. It CAN take a long time to learn, but this book could help. After 63 years of marriage... to the same man.... I think I could qualify as an expert. Wish I had found it about 60 years ago!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I like the case, good price does what I bought it for, would recommend for first time kindle owners. Bye
B00932A4XE|4.0|Good characterisations.  It is a movie one can not stop watching once one started watching. Sets and locations and characters played their parts quite well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderful heartfelt book. I would recommended it to all to read. Thank you for writing this book. I hope everyone reads it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like being able to see the weather anywhere and everywhere I go.  I can take my kindle or on the phone and access the weather channel at time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is highly addicting and I can't wait to play everyday.  The bingo rooms have a great variety and there is a level for everyone.  I just started playing about six months ago and there is plenty to keep me playing for a long time!

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I don't actually game too much with this, that was my first reason for the purchase... but after setting up multiple profiles for Photoshop, FCP and other programs I actually ended up using it for more professional use.<br /><br />Works great through Logitech's Gaming Software on Mac OSX.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0063M22QO|3.0|It's not much of a challenge like my original Mahjong game is, which is a little too difficult. Wish there were one version in the middle.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I always enjoy Kate Morton books as they keep you enthralled to the end as you unravel the mystery, couldn't put it down.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is very cute and the graphics are great, but it is too difficult for my grandchildren right now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Story lines, captures that time beautifully. Can't wait for next season to start. I want to live at Downton Abbey :)
B0061PEAUY|3.0|While I have always liked the &#34;Bones&#34; character, I thought this storyline was a little convoluted. I am not sure that I would recommend this book as a good read.
B00C0W08XK|4.0|Not fond of the grid highlight. It's distracting---makes it harder to keep the three columns and rows straight. I would like to find out how to remove it. I don't even know what purpose it serves.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The book was very well written!  It held my interest from the first page!  I had never heard about the Orphan Train so I felt I was learning about  the history of our Country. . I loved the characters and they were very well described in the book.  Overall a great read. I look forward to reading books written by this author.
B006ZAZ31U|3.0|I have a hard time with all of the \\"gods plan\\" drivel. Adam Brown was a hell of a warrior and a contradiction. Warrior and true believer. Every setback was a test from god? I don't buy it. What exactly was gods plan when most of SEAL team six was killed in a helicopter?
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Big fan of temple run..The graphics on this one are by far the best so far but...the control, not so much I play on my galaxy tab 2 and when I try to turn I can't and when I try to jump I can't.soo needless to say I haven't been able to become addicted to this one like I have to the other 2 temple run games. But like I said the graphics RoCk.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|This is a classic 80's film that is sure to entertain you with with love, friendship, hardships and lots of creativity!!
B0069UV0LS|5.0|This is the first movie I've seen that honestly depicts real life. We all can be beautiful, saintly even, but we can also be so dark, evil, lost. This movie gets it. I guess I seem to relate due to circumstances in my own life, nothing as extreme as the movie but very real none the less.<br /><br />The two main characters have really nailed their parts. They should have won an Academy Award.<br /><br />If your honest with yourself and you've had any life issues to deal with you WILL understand this flick.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I am completely happy with the fine work done on this recording. I do not think these songs get the credit they deserve in the mainstream due to length and in some instances subject matter. His loyal following will hopefully fuel many more projects.<br /><br />The Title Track + Watchmaker are my favs. Drive Home is a classic! What an amazing guitar solo.<br /><br />Keep up the great work Steven!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a very fun game!It oz kind of like Mario. You get lives by hitting boxes. You also try to run through obstacles such as animals and falling. Get this game! It IS as good as bacon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! BEST game I've ever played. It's challenging and addicting and there so many things to buy like another character and a surf board
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Have the concert DVD, but wanted the audio tracks on a CD so I could listen to it in the car or on the ipod.  This concert is a must have for any Clapton fan.  Great music by a legendary band and this is a concert you can't get tired of listening to.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Sooooo very sorry I purchased this game. Yeah it says free but the minute u start to play it goes to a screen that wants u to PAY to proceed! I caught my grandson just before he pressed a $99 app! Buyer beware. I hurried up & tried to delete!!!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Enjoy this CD in the car to & from work......it helps ! Beautiful....even if my Italian is not so good !
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Was lots of fun for a diversionary read on my Kindle. Well done, Tina. Look forward to your next book!
B0008ENICU|5.0|An iconic movie, a must see! Every character is so done you know, regardless of the fact that it was made decades ago, and the fashions are to die for!
B004LWZW6U|3.0|First of all this movie includes everything the first had, crazy humor, over the top acting/gore, hot chicks getting topless, characters that don't have much story that we get to know, absolute choas in the second half and a twist ending.<br /><br />Now unlike the first one this movie takes almost everything way to far. In the first one, everything that was done made sense and while some stuff was cheezy I never complained, here I've got all sorts of complaints. What's the deal with Piranha's impregnating a girl? Why does that guy think the girl did something do his blank? Why did you make the brillent Christopher Loyd comic relief when in the last movie he was serious? What happened to the parent Piranha's? And this ending PLEASE? And it's obvious that we aren't going to care about almost every person on this cast so geez.<br /><br />However I will give this movie two pro's. One I did laugh a lot and two I did care for a couple of the cast namely Maddy, Barry, Shelby and kinda Josh (mainly just his story arch).<br /><br />All in all this is the first movie gone super cheezy, but since I did enjoy enough of it to say I'm happy I'll give it 3 stars.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I love the music and the actors are wonderful and attractive.  Beatles music is always classic. Can't go wrong with Across the Universe!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is ok. I will see the movie again. My daughters enjoy the movie. I will recommend it to anyone
B0029EDMEG|4.0|I wish I could rent the whole series in sequence. I enjoyed the portrayal of Jesse Stone in these movies.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I can not say I enjoy very many movies now day but this is a must see.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|What can I really say?  This is a fantastic movie that people born prior to 1990 can happily watch with the younger crowd. No inappropriate sexy scenes that are too common in current flicks, and lots of life lessons: It's not just your parents who extoll hard work! :)
193700788X|4.0|I had no idea about all the uproar regarding this book until I finished reading it last night. I was and still am a rabid Eric fan but from the start of the series, in every single book, it was very clear that Sookie did not want to be a vampire. Her greatest joy in life was laying out in her backyard tanning, for pete's sake! She also wanted children and to be normal. It was also clear that no matter what he felt for Sookie, Eric would always put Eric first. I was hoping that Ms. Harris would pull a magic rabbit out of her hat and find a way for Eric and Sookie to work but it wouldn't have made sense and I accept that. The way things shook out is the way the author had said they would from the beginning and if people don't understand that, they should probably go back and read the series from the start. It was startling to read reviews that said Eric had been forced into a rape like situation when it's pretty obvious that he was making a power play that he very much wanted to make. He wanted to be King and to keep Sookie if he could but he was never going to turn down Freyda to stay Sheriff of Area 5.
007174889X|5.0|First time I read this book when I was a medical student from 1968 to 1973. The best text book of Internal Medicine then and now.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Each game takes about 15-20 mins.  Addictive strategy.<br /><br />I play the board version of this game with friends.  Very happy to find this, but it is still better with real people and other expansions.  This game is great.  Challenging yet fun.<br /><br />Much like &#34;Settlers of Catan&#34; without the resources.<br /><br />Play the River 2.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie was great and it is for everyone. From the beautiful photography to the touching story it is a winner. I have watched it three times already.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Red is very entertaining, not all the way true to Comics but, Very entertaining would like to see more of this. Besides who has not wanted to break into the CIA and get away with it... Brue Willis, only he pull this off! Supporting cast is Equally Brilliant.  all of them.<br />But you knew this and the STudios new it too. Great entertainmen!  Cold, war spoof, comics, and just plan great!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Minecraft is better in my opinion but this is much alike to it. I think it's a pretty cool way to start off though. I have the full version which of course has more time and I think it's pretty cool.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Please go back to previous version.  The new update is small print difficult to navigate and just plain unlikeable.  The previous version was so easy to use with just tapping on information you wanted or swiping through hourly temps.  Sometimes new isn't always better.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Now that I have read the final installment of stackhouse books I can say confidently that I completely disagree with all the negative reviews I read previous to buying it. I feel that most people read these books flippantly and don't keep in mind that mrs.harris said all along she wanted to write about a girl who falls in love with vampires but never ever wants to become one. I think people have gotten so enamored with the juvenile vampires of today's world like twilight and the vampire diaries. The stackhouse vampires have always been truer to the horrible nightmarish vampires we all grew up hearing about.<br />A lot of reviews were angry because sookie and Eric didnt end up together. But really, while I loved them together, Eric always saw humans as someone to manipulate and that we're beneath him. Sookie was never comfortable with most of the stunts Eric pulled and just because she loved him didn't mean they were meant to be together. How you could read the book previous to this one and not know that Sam would be who sookie ended up with is beyond me. While I would have liked her with Quinn or alcide, Harris kept true to form by making the differences in the supernatural beings and the non supes realistic and impossible to cross for long term. I think that while sookie had some fae in her she was much more human than not. And because Sam was a shifter who, in the last book embraced his human side fully, he was the closest thing to human sookie could find and not go crazy hearing their thoughts. Sam and sookie just make sense.<br />Some reviews I read said something about a cure for sookies telepath and Eric being sold into slavery...that just doesn't happen in this book. Im not sure where people got that from; if they just didn't read it with actual attention or if they just didn't understand what they were reading. But the end of this series was exactly as it should have been. Eric received his life long dream of power while protecting sookie as best he could. He never loved her as humans loved. He loved her as something of a novelty. And in the end he chose power over human emotions, just like we had been led to believe he always would.<br />Everyone would have loved a big happy ending where the vampires realize they can still find their humanity and the girl chooses to become a vamp and live out eternity with the love of her life etc etc. But I feel truly refreshed to read a book where the girl  choses actual humanity and a normal life the way God intended her to have it over immortality.<br />I gave this book a 4/5 because it was a little confusing to follow the story line at times. But all of her books are like that so I expected it. I just wish someone would correct it when they do all that editing!<br />Don't let the negative reviews sway you from starting or finishing this series. If you keep in mind that these aren't your every day sparkly vampires and our leading lady isn't some naive awe struck kid with no idea what she wants for her life, you will love these books just as much as I have. Because these are not books about vampires and werewolves...these are books about sookie stackhouse and her journey.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|Great start to the final book.  Reminds readers and viewers of what has happened and provides updates in preparation for that extremely intriguing conclusion. I so look forward to that resolution of this series.
B004UPALT6|5.0|Evening, afternoon, morning, mid of the night~ Evil dead is just an awesome film,  Love to watch this film on a plane ,train, car home, this one goes far!  Classic!
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this when it was first released on DVD and bought this edition strictly for the additional footage. It's a fun re-telling of the Homer epic with action-packed CGI.  Well, that and you get to see Diane Kruger's boobs in this version.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I did not know what to do when the book ended.  She really details<br />Lincoln's leadership skills.  Five stars all the way.
B0067R0APK|1.0|The latest update/version of this app sucks. Much preferred the old interface. This one looks amateurish. It is cheap, but even so, a waste of money.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love games with quest to do and to find stuff. It's ok be of those games in which you are going to play again no matter what.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good graphics. This app is different from all the other hidden object games. This game has a fun interactive story line. My 9 year old loves it.
B0057R5G6E|2.0|Amazing movie.  Great Blu-ray rendition. Looked really cool, but the model of is plastic.  I have collected resin sculptures from LOTR and expected the same.  Wrong.  Cheap.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Really good but it needs to be more like minecraft pc too.please do it and one more thing capes please.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it.  Can't wait to see Season three.  Great Cast and characters.  Would recommend this to a friend.  I'm hooked.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Thiis game is good for eye/hand coronation. You have to move fast and beat the time. Fun for al ages.So play and enjoy.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'm a Broadway geek and when I first say this live it was a life changing experience.  Trite, huh? But I have seen few shows that marry music, drama and staging for what Wagner would call a Gezamstkuntsewerke.  So the movie could only disappoint. But it didn't.  It was apples and oranges. The use of close camera work and live-filmed, believable singing made this an amazingly new experience for someone who saw it live 4 times.  See it live and see the movie.  It's brilliant. Any other year Best Picture would have been a lock.
B00AD9YLG2|5.0|A man. A woman. A poet. A noble creature. A writer. Who is Orlando? Does it really matter? Does time flow through Orlando's fingers like a gale on the sea? Does love form on his lips, or on her lips, or on nobody's lips, to be devoured by hours and then years of melancholy, to be suddenly reborn at the sight of an oak tree, and then burn down to cinders again? What is life? What do leaves mean, or the rain, or why does one's chest rise in ecstasy at the sight of a sun ray falling through stained glass? Perhaps it can be explained, it can be written about and expressed, or perhaps one has to struggle though centuries to be able to capture even a shadow of this understanding. Why does sex matter? Why can't it be simply love without boundaries, without any explanations, delicate and passionate, broken and strung together into one piano piece being recited by a child, heard echoing actross time from one of the open windows?<br /><br />I feel like to be able to read Orlando one has to put all literary rules aside and simply dip one's head into Virginia Woolf's subconscious, to be able to notice the flow of the narrative, to feel the torment, the splendor and the doubts and the juxtaposition of a rich inner writer's world and the chaotic confusing outer existence. It's beautiful. It's lyric. It's heart wrenching in its constant questions, as it transcends time and gender and even novel boundaries in this story without a real beginning or a real end, that can be picked up and read from the middle. I can perhaps describe Orlando in one word. Wonder. It's about wonder. Wonder of life, death, love, poetry, and every slanted shadow in between, the silence beating her heavy wings on the passage of time, from 16th century to the 20th. Dotted with exquisite humor that made me laugh out loud. And wisdom. A kind of wondrous wisdom that one gains from doing art. The understanding of life one moment, the complete loss of it the next.<br /><br />Don't read Orlando. Feel it. And you'll find yourself enthralled.find yourself enthralled.

Genetically modified foods? Take your pick; you'll find a book or ten that make the claim. This one is less convincing than most.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|Awesome movie! As a former collegiate Acapella member, this is spot on and so fun to watch! Would recommend to singers and non- singers alike.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app. You can store multiple locations and shift from one to the other with ease. Can only see up to 36 hr though.
068484267X|5.0|An excellent rainy day read.  The book draws you in and transports you into Frank's life through all the good times as well as the bad.<br />Jan
B00BF123WG|4.0|i enjoy movies that are based on true stories. the woman character was apparently a combination of many woman who worked on the capturing of Osama Bin Ladin.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Why do I call this a rewrite of an age old tale?<br /><br />Well - you have a young shepherd with older brothers who don't like him, a king seeking soldiers for his army, a mysterious mystic who advises the king and encourages the boy, a huge monster struck in the head from the boy's slingshot, a king's son who is extremely vain and wants the throne, and a younger prince who becomes great friends with the boy (who is obviously destined for more).<br /><br />The boy's name is Thor, but King David would do as well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once you start watching the first episode you have to watch them all!  Can't wait for season 3 to come out!
B000FBFML6|5.0|Another Fabulous book by Robin Hood. When I finished Fool's Fate I thought that was the end of it and I was bumming, then I saw Fool's Fate! It was a great story and definitely had some surprises! I love reading all of Robin Hood's books! She is an awesome writer! I have read almost all her books now and they are all fabulous!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love supernatural and after binge watching seven seasons it felt as if no more how much I loved the characters I may have seen the best they offer.<br />Not even close as this season feels like it comes together with development in every episode and twists that without warning still fall into place.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The standard by which others are judged. Blue ray hd makes this better than ever. I can recommend this product.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The DVD came in very good shape. There were no scratches or nicks the case cover was in very good shape. I had no problems watching the movie. If you like to watch movies at a low price then I recommend Amazon. It is the best place to find good deals on movies!!!
B005Q6TBOO|5.0|couldn&#34;t stop laughing. chou is too funny, and i hope mike tyson is in pt.3, i pre-ordered from amazon because they&#34;re the best mail order company, you get your items delivered so fast.i won&#34;t lend out this film, i won&#34;t get it back! get this movie, just too funny to describe
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have not read a book this well written in a very long time.  The characters were bizarre and yet utterly believable.  You cannot help caring about both of them.<br />The problem with acting the \\"cool girl\\" is it is unsustainable!  Her anger/insanity is brilliantly conceived and conveyed.<br />Will definitely read another of her books.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|lots of clean action.  a little far fetched but a lots of action.  Good teenage movie.  keeps you on your seat.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|On paper, Jump SOUNDS like it'll be a great and helpful app... Prior to getting clarification and further information directly from the developer, that hadn't been MY experience with it.<br /><br />Once everything's set up, I've been able to connect remotely to my home PC via my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The screen on my PC goes to a solid blue screen with the Jump logo at the bottom right corner (you can change the settings in the app, though, so your PC's desktop doesn't change while you're in the app). The description indicates that it'll be a very helpful app for the individual on-the-go that needs access to stationary systems when away from them. And it is, so long as you ensure that you WRITE DOWN Google's 2-Step Verification generated ASP for entry both in the app on your device, and on your system. You MUST write it down, though, to enter it into both fields, and, unless you want constant headaches, do NOT uncheck the \\"Autosave Password\\" box in the app's settings on your device, or you're in for headaches!<br /><br />LONG story not-so-short, Jump DOES lock onto your Google 2-Step Verification password as your account password. You CANNOT change it without revoking and regenerating an ASP if you use Google's 2-Step Verification. I'd be willing to bet money on that declaration, especially after speaking with one of the app's developers and asking him thorough enough questions that I am pretty damned positive that that's exactly how this app works. However, so long as you DON'T uncheck that \\"Autosave Password\\" box or revoke your original ASP in Google's 2-Step Verification area of your account, you should be fine. Should you end up NOT following those steps, however, you'll need to generate a new ASP. The steps the developer (whose name I don't recall) had me follow to get everything to work properly were:<br /><br />1. Generate a new ASP in Google 2-Step Verification, since I'd revoked my initial ASP after frustratedly uninstalling the app from both my phone and my PC following multiple attempts to set it up with my own password. Trying to use that first ASP, obviously, didn't work, as I'd revoked it after my initial uninstall.<br /><br />2. Once the new ASP has been generated, DOCUMENT IT - you'll NEED it to enter into the setup screen once you've downloaded the corresponding program to your system you're trying to view remotely, so DON'T follow Google's suggestion that you don't need to write it down because you'll never need it again. Once you've entered it into the program on your computer system, THEN you can discard it, or generate a new ASP, and go through the above steps again.<br /><br />3. Once I'd entered the ASP in both the app and in the downloaded program, the developer had me go to my mobile device's settings, and under Application Manager in my Note 2, open up the Jump app, and Force Stop it.<br /><br />4. The next step was to restart my computer, and, with the Jump app reopened - which went directly to my available computers, rather than prompting me to login - the developer had me select the computer I wanted to connect to. With my computer restarted, and the app previously Force Stopped, Jump immediately connected to my PC with no problems, and no prompts for passwords.<br /><br />Somewhere in all of the above, the developer also had me redownload my VNC connection, and enter the VNC password I'd originally created. The VNC password that I'd set up, and not revoked or altered, worked just fine, as it should for anyone following those steps properly. My steps above may also be slightly out of order, as I'm typing my update here going solely on recall from a pretty lengthy call with the developer, but I'm hopeful they'll prove helpful, either way, if anyone has any of the difficulties I experienced. The developer said that they'd experienced bugs with the app, that he thought that that's what I initially encountered, and that Google's 2-Step Verification has placed restrictions on the app that they're trying to figure out how to work around, and ultimately get away from. Now that I fully understand EXACTLY how this works, and that, no, you CAN'T change your password to something you're more comfortable with if you're using Google 2-Step Verification, I feel that this app DOES really stand up to its competitors. I'd pretty much given up on it with my previous attempts. My CDO brain (OCD, but, ya know, everything has to be arranged correctly, so...) tends to lock onto things that don't work properly, and get inordinately agitated by them, as was the case here with my fixation on using my own, self-generated password. It's just not possible with Google 2-Step Verification, but, once everything IS set up properly, as long as you don't revoke that ASP, everything should work just fine.<br /><br />I know I've been crazy verbose here, but it's all in hopes that no one else out there will encounter the issues I did, and not know how to fix 'em. Initial Tech Support really didn't have any idea that their telling me to simply change my password WOULDN'T work, but the app's developers are thorough enough that they were willing to go far above and beyond standard tech support. For that, and the understanding of exactly how this works, gleaned directly from a developer that was willing to call and troubleshoot with me on a Sunday, I've bumped my review up to five stars. The details of how Jump works need to be fleshed out for those that experience the problems I did, but once you understand exactly what to do if you hit a snag, and can fix it, it's right up there with the best of its competitors!g to figure out how to work around, and ultimately get away from.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Looks like they finally found a stronghold for themselves or maybe not? It's going to be interesting the rest of the way.
B0051T46XM|5.0|If you enjoy movies like Cloverfield, you'll love this movie. If you don't enjoy movies like Cloverfield, you'll still love this movie. Very well done, very original.
B00CBRI9G2|1.0|I kept waiting for some depth to the story, but without any real dialogue the acting alone did not convey emotional depth
B00AFEY354|5.0|Purchased this for my son as a Valentine's gift, at his request. As far as I know he liked it and didn't have an problems with the DVD otherwise he would have complained about it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I would have liked to have seen a different for ending for Sookie but it was still a good read.  I enjoyed the whole series and love the story line and characters.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its just the same thing every time and it gets boring. But its not all that bad. It just needs some improvement.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Ok, I got hooked on the series and I kept looking forward to the next episode.  With that being said, some of the story lines are a bit contrived and predictable.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy playing. but have had problems getting on the internet with it. I find it challenging. hope this helps
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I do not us use it often but when I do it works great.  It is easy and simple to use as well.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I read all the spoiler hoopla but I prefer to think for myself, so I read the book. In fact, I read it in one sitting and cried at the end. Why? Because Sookie finally got what she wanted most in the world, what she's told us that she wanted from the first book.<br /><br />*slight spoiler* We got to watch Sookie go from being isolated and miserable, to not only accepting herself, but being accepted within the community she loves. I can't conceive of a better ending for her. If you're confused, I suggest you go back to the beginning and read the series again because Sookie tells us over and over what she wants.<br /><br />The only thing Ms. Harris owes us, as readers, is to be true to the characters she created. She did exactly that. If it's not what you would choose, if it's not sexy or dangerous enough, I would submit that's because you are not Sookie Stackhouse.<br /><br />While it did seem a bit forced at times, I enjoyed seeing so many old characters return for a curtain call. It's been a wild fun ride and I'll miss them all but it's time to let go. I, for one, am looking forward to reading Ms. Harris' next creation.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I typically don't like musicals, and I've read the book as well as seen a professional stage production.  I was expecting to be bored but thought I'd check it out, especially after being up for so many awards.  I ended up being very captivated.  Loved it!
0783240287|2.0|I saw the live stage play in Chicago with Donny Osmond.  This vidio was not like the stage play at all.  The songs were still the same but I did not enjoy the vidio at all.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. I loved this soundtrack because it drew me into the film. The music really spoke to my college partying years, times when I was discovering new life, fresh out of a mostly white urban environment, in a way similar to what Toby experiences, and the big parties everyone goes to, and geared me into the scenes to really feel what I do believe Fitzgerald would have been lovely to have us feel. If there was anything I think they could have done better, it's only that they could used even more intense music.. but I believe Luhrmann didn't want to have a soundtrack that would alienate his more mainstream audience.. who I do think it would be a shame to lose, as much as I hate compromise in art, as they can really learn something from this work. I loved it. I'm going to go see it again first chance I get. Absolutely near perfection. It embodies a near perfection marked by chaos that compliments this film fantastically.
B00513F9Q6|4.0|If I had to describe this book with one phrase, I would say it is an exploration of the socialization of women. That makes it sound dreadfully boring and academic, which it isn't.<br /><br />Cat's Eye tells the story of painter Elaine Risley, who returns to Toronto (the city where she was raised) after a long absence for a retrospective of her work. The combination of examining her own artistic and personal development because of the retrospective, and her presence in the changed city of her childhood leads to a prolonged reflection on her life, and in particular, her childhood friendship with a girl named Cordelia. Each chapter explores a different time and memory, and Elaine moves back and forth between the present and past. The book is also about secrets, and it unfolds in an unpredictable way.<br /><br />Elaine's work is completely personal to her, although, as with the work of most artists, viewers interpret it as being filled with universal meaning or political statements. One of the insights of this book is the way in which the personal stories behind each painting, which are, of course, not known to most viewers, can be interpreted as conveying some kind of universal truth or political statement. That leads me back to my opening description. You can read this as a collection of a character's memories, or as a fictionalized examination of the ways in which the role of women - and the socialization of girls and women into their gender roles - has shifted over time. In either case, it is an interesting and compelling read.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Ok, I got hooked on the series and I kept looking forward to the next episode.  With that being said, some of the story lines are a bit contrived and predictable.  I find some of the acting to be wanting.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|The app is too heavy. Takes too long for toolbars to come up, pages to get flipped. Reaction time is really irritating
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting.Its extremely fun.And if you would want it ,its free.I RECOMMEND IT SUPER BADLY.ITS SURELY THE BOSS OF GAMES WAY  better than temple run.But it is not as good as Minecraft
B007VUA7VO|5.0|you can tell at a quick glance what is going on.  love it.  Glad I got the app for my Kindle Fire HD
B00CFNUC0S|1.0|I'm very disappointed in all the changes to Shaun the Sheep. I think Season 1 is the cutest thing ever and it makes me LOL, but Season 2 is just lame, in my opinion. For me, it's not even funny anymore, and I can only give it the lowest rating available.<br /><br />Honestly, what were the creators of the show thinking when they changed it? Oh well, I can watch Season 1 over and over and over and never get tired of it!
B000FBJFSC|3.0|When I started reading this very sad, yet funny memoir; I thought &#34;how did this boy live through this and grow up to be such a beautiful writer?&#34;. Poverty, a long suffering mother, alcoholism, and a nasty, unfeeling extended family, doesn't make for raising a fully functional adult. Frank McCourt is a survivor like no other. The only thing I did not like about the book was how it spent too much time on his fascination with masturbation as a young teen and the strange way in which it ends.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is a good periodic time waster. Like all games that use energy, waiting for your energy to refill can get old.
B000085RTX|4.0|Honestly my favorite albums of theirs are Black Halo and Epica but this album is definitely a good one to purchase
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I was raised in Astoria where this was filmed so it is very fun the see the places I played. That said, the distances that the kids bicycle is totally impossible. The Goonie house is a regular attraction in town.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I enjoyed the authentic style in which the story and the journey of Zappos. It was inspiring to see values and a larger message making a difference in how you do business and the world.
0307341550|3.0|Camille Preaker is a troubled young woman and a mediocre journalist. When her editor sends her to her home-town in Missouri for investigative reporting on a possible serial killer, she must stay with her emotionally-destructive mother and wild half-sister. As Camille struggles with ghosts from her past, including her own self-destructive behavior and memories of a dead sister, she discovers that the murders are darker and more complex than she'd originally suspected.<br /><br />Although this book certainly had a good deal of mystery to it, it wasn't really for me. Although I generally liked Camille's character, there were several times when I groaned inwardly at her choices. She was weak and self-destructive. Such characters are really difficult to write well, and Sharp Objects had a bit of a debut-novel feel to it - perhaps Camille's character should have been created by a more seasoned author. Another issue I had with the book is it was simply too dark for my tastes. There was so much ugliness in the book. Violence, self-loathing, sexual exploitation, and more. On the other hand, I DO understand why some people like this book. The key question to ask is - how much ugliness can you deal with? If you like reading about emotionally troubled characters, then this book would be attractive to you. There was a slight redemptive feel to the story at the end. A ray of hope for Camille. I appreciate that I was given that much.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A friend got me hooked on this show and I love it!  It is a challenge to do other things since I am trying to catch up.
B000JML7EC|5.0|arrrg. i swear by my afidavy that this is the penultimate expression of pirate-dom. All others pale in comparison. yo ho ho!
B003UAKE9Y|3.0|I thought this would be along the lines of Corpse Bride, or the Nightmare before Christmas.  The storyline is more abstract than that and hard for kids to truly understand.  Mostly it is just creepy for children.  I have two, which gave me this review.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun. Makes you think  not hard to play.  It's free I like that very much.  It threw me at first when it was all black cards.  But now I am getting good with it would recommend it
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really like mahjong, I enjoy the matching of shapes and colors. I try to play games that keep my mind active in a number of different ways. I believe the matching of symbols is not a bad thing!
1455816795|5.0|Got this for my mother who loves to read, but whose eyesite is failing.  We listened to it together.  It's very well done.  Good clear voices.  I wanted to find some unabridged books, but couldn't find Treasure Island that way.  But this radio play is very well-done.  Includes the entire store line with narration and actor voices.  3 CDs total.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this story. We all need a Grey once in our life time. Not just for the obvious but for the life's lessons as well. This story is about much more than that.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this app is pretty good, in my opinion.  the object: build your dream city and do all the goals.  like many other apps it wants you to pay for a certain type of points :(.  the other thing I don't like is that my buses keep getting stuck at the shopping mall.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If you liked a certain other &#34;jewel&#34; game, you'll enjoy this one as well. Very similar to the other game, but with an added speed bonus feature - the faster you complete a level, the higher your score. Definitely a GREAT freebie!
B009AJD5E0|3.0|A 'three' to 'three and a half' star film. It has the budget. It has the acting. It has Ridley Scott! But honestly, it was rather slow.<br /><br />Set on a distant star cluster, a group of \\"scientists\\" are searching for the origin of man. My guess is a vagina, but back to the movie. So, after some brilliant research (or just a wild hypothesis based upon some similar cave drawings) the scientists are off to the remote cluster to find the answer of our creation. This is where the fun begins. Or not.......<br /><br />Sleepiness ensues as ridiculous \\"scientific\\" exploration and human-like alien corpses are discovered. The team seems to fall apart at the seams quite early after this discovery. Then the usual \\"good space team\\", \\"bad space team\\", \\"what is the actual mission?\\" scenarios follow.<br /><br />This is the movie in a nutshell. Don't expect some mind blowing conclusion or life altering philosophy change. It certainly has some entertainment value and great FX, but for me, it was better to pick out the ridiculous choices of the characters and ranting about them throughout the movie.<br /><br />Closing... A decent film that didn't have to be 2 hours 5 minutes long. But it is...... So to people looking to watch a 2 hour movie in 30 minutes, fast forward to the ending. You're really not going to miss anything. The ending, however, is rather cool!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very Steamy. I think every woman fantasizes about this kind of thing at some time or other. I could read it over and over.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Love the show and was happy with the price on the season! Would support anyone else who was a fan of this show to collect the season.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|First time that I've used it. Simple and practical, it just does what it supposed to do. It helped me right away to change the channels of my wifi networks at home avoiding interference with other signals. Recommended
B0063IH60K|1.0|This would be a great game if there weren't really obnoxious ads between EVERY game. I am removing it and paying for a game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thought the room was Great! Very good graphics, the game it's self was fun and very challenging Can't wait for the next game, you should give it a try. This game has won several awards, one being the game of the year not bad for their first at bats. Can't wait to see what they come up with next!!!!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|You can feel her pain, excitement, fear and glory in her words. Easy to read, adequately descriptive without being too much. Great characters and scenery. Makes you want to see this part of the country and gives you belief in the goodness of strangers.

B008APX4P0|4.0|I live in Australia and when I ordered this screen I was worried that the voltage would be incompatible with our standards but it has a universal range so don’t worry if you are buying this for overseas use. I did need to buy a new electric cable from my local electrics store as the one it came with had a Japanese plug ( the end that goes into the screen is universal).  Screen arrived well packaged and on time from Japan. It has a good rotation angle and adjustable height and at the back it has a handle that you can lift the whole screen to wipe the dust on your desk easily. The screen is light weight and has speakers. I play Wow, watch TV series on my PC and do all my work on it. The screen has met all my expectations so far. It has 4-5 pre-set modes for movies, games, Eco etc. so you don’t have to sit there and adjust your settings each time. It comes with a remote control and does NOT have any other MENU buttons on the actual screen apart for the volume adjustment so DON’T lose your remote. The menu for adjustments is mainly in Japanese on screen and on the instructions in the box but you can download an English version of it. Frankly, apart from the first couple of days that I went into the menus out of sheer curiosity I have never touched it since. This screen is really plug and play and a good all-rounder.
0761536434|5.0|This is an excellent book with a lot of information. It is researched and annotated, and the author discloses potential conflicts of interest (there are a couple instances where he sources himself, having been a games journalist; he points these out). However, there are some things to understand before buying and reading.<br /><br />- It is U.S.-centric. There are occasional asides on the Canadian, European, and Japanese markets, but only when that information is relevant to U.S. gaming. No other gaming markets are mentioned.<br /><br />- This book focuses very heavily on the industry side of things. There's a lot of time spent on U.S. court cases and how they shaped the U.S. industry. The establishment, rise, and fall of companies are documented in detail. Individual personalities who worked within game companies are examined. And there's a whole lot of numbers.<br /><br />- There is little focus on PC gaming, except with regards to its contributions to console gaming. There is discussion of handhelds, but not to the same extent as there is for consoles. The book stops looking at handhelds with the 5th generation and it stops looking at consoles with the 6th generation.<br /><br />I found it all very interesting, but if you are looking for an in-depth look at, say, the evolution of video game design, or the influence that video games and culture have exerted on each other, you won't find it here. When those topics arise, it's usually as a brief introduction to a different topic.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good book. A different read of what I'm used to. Always had an interest in Zombie movies and this book adds a bit of realism to the subject.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have loved all the Sookie Stackhouse books, some more than others yes, but I have enjoyed them all. I am sad to see her go.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|A good &#34;Bones&#34; story, easy to read. Temprance is tenacious in finding out the truth, often putting herself in danger. The truth is that important to her. I thought I knew what the story was about and boy was I wrong--delightfully wrong. The twists and turns were interesting. This book doesn't need gratuitous sex and filthy language to make it a good read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of the best games i have ever played,very very very good i recommend you download,all though you need to wait a while to boot it the first time but dont give up

B0061PEAUY|5.0|This book will keep you guessing. It will also enlighten you about Canadian  Law Keepers and the town of Yellowknife. It is a very interesting book.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album rocks! I actually like every song on it. The best Macklemore and Ryan Lewis Album yet! Woo hOO!
B001D09OAI|5.0|Although I may be biased, to me this movie reminds me of the best of baseball, before the drama of steroids and strikes. It had the perfect &#34;ensemble&#34; of characters. It always brings back great memories from when I was a kid going to County Stadium in Milwaukee to catch games during the summer. I was sad to see the old stadium go. But every time I want to relive it I just watch this movie as it was filmed at County Stadium and my family volunteered to be extras in the crowd during filming.

B00BUCW54Q|4.0|For a movie I did not hear of until it was released on DVD, this movie was great. Great mix of intrigue and action. Tom Cruise performed superb.
B00865P3AS|5.0|I picked this up at the local library and am just blown away.  Have already played it twice tonight.  Really innovation use of the cello with others that round out the sound delightfully.  Standouts for me are Clocks and Benedictus (the most sensual of songs).  I am getting copies for some of my friends who appreciate unique music.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|One of the most epic fantasy novels I've read. Been weeks since I read it and the whole story's still stuck in my head.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this version of solitaire. I find myself getting addicted and loosing track of time while playing. Thanks.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|How can something be too technical when you are writing about Heaven? I think he spends too much time delving into the subconscious. Just not the &#34;feel good&#34; read I was looking for. Not a bad book, just not my cup of tea.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Raiding, polyandry and shield maidens coupled with Norse mysticism+some head banging music...what more could a girl ask for? It's all history!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My friends and I love horses. So this will be the perfect game for my friends and I.<br /><br />LOVE THIS GAME.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|We are not expected to see beyond the veil..but I believe in His love for us and why wouldn’t  He give us hope in extra ordinary happenings like these wrote about.  Life is so precious.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a quick read!! Really enjoyed the book!! It was hard to put down and I wish there was more.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|Fun game; clearly designed for a tablet, not a phone.  It does work on a phone, just hope you're tapping on the right thing (and that it decides you want to do something ...).  Even with that, it's quite playable on a phone.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I myself find it very interesting in how to match the pieces and how many times it takes to get the puzzle finished
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read every book in this series of Sookie Stackhouse and have enjoyed them all. This ending was a very good way to end the series but of course when you finish a big series you would always like to have another one or more. If you have not read this complete series I would highly recommend you to do so. Thanks Charlaine Harris for this fun journey!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This app is much fun I love it and recommend it to all iron man fans I have a lot of suits.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is your standard Stephen King read.  If you like him, you will love the book.  He takes a stab at time travel this time.  He even admits in the preface that he never really gets into the time travel theory of the story. There is a time bubble in the back of the diner and that is just the total explanation.  He refers to Finney's book, TIme and Again as the best time travel story and I agree.  This is a great idea about &#34;what if&#34; and being able to see the results of the changes.  While it is a long book it moves along and keeps you going.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I do not like this game because my daughter can not log out for anyone else to be able to play and support service has not explained why r how to accomplish this
B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|Fairly decent program, but I think I will wait until it gets down to a $19.95-$24.95 price range, HBO and Showtime can get by charging top dollar for their series which are original and very well produced. Netflix Americanized a very popular BBC production by the same name from several years back and claim it to be original.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This the best breeding game that i have ever gotten there are cool looking dragons. And I have tons of stuff.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|I saw this movie on Netflix and loved it so much that I bought the DVD.<br />The emotions in a number of scenes feels very real and made me cry a number of times.<br />And at the end it made me feel really good and entertained.<br />The movie is long, but well worth it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I started playing this only a few weeks ago and yet I play all day everyday. Whether I'm only on for a few min or and hr its loads of fun and my 2 yr old loves the baby dragons!<br />I def give it 5 stars!
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Great movie for the children. Started off a little slow, but hen picked up and they loved it. Ages 1 and 3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best exploring and surviving game in the world there are sheep chickens cows and other stuff and I heared there is an update pretty soon I don't know when but I heard it's great fun so get this app now or you'll be sorry.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Not for the fainthearted, this weighty tome makes War and Peace look anaemic.<br />Then again, one must attempt to do justice to explaining the tumultuous and convoluted steps that led a middle class Californian orphan to becoming one of the 20th and 21st Century's greatest visionaries. This book does a great job of capturing the ups and downs along the way, as well as the personality of the man throughout. This book is not a hagiography. There is plenty of Steve at his most charming and prescient, but also plenty (arguably if not more) of Steve at his most manipulative and divisive.<br />Detailed, clearly written, painstakingly researched, it is close a reference to the man's life and lessons that those of us who never knew him will likely ever get.<br />Potentially filled also with lessons for aspiring managers and entrepreneurs. Be prepared for a long slog though. Best to intersperse this one with small doses of fiction.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|For me, Life of PI was an interesting story (although a little too detailed in some parts) which in the end seemed to be affirmation of the existence of  benevolent God.  It was enjoyable, easy reading; the variety of situations during the long sea voyage was impressive.  Sure, parts of the book were &#34;made up&#34; ... what's wrong with that ?<br /><br />I would recommend this book to most anyone, except the agnostic down the street.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Please, Mr. Martin,  Finish this series!!!!!  Serious cliff-hangers after 800 pages of reading are just pure torture.<br />Can't wait for the next one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Those game is so addicting I've loved minecraft for so long but my computer is messed up and I don't have an Xbox so this just makes me so happy you can make countless things but it takes a long time to update but overall it is an epic game
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Chilling on too many levels to name.<br />A fascinating insight to life (or the lack thereof) inside North Korea.<br />A testament to human cruelty, apathy and selfishness that one hopes will never be replicated subsequently, and will continue to stand as an aberration on the record of modern human civilisation.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey season 3 continues the excellence of the first two seasons: a superb script superbly acted.  The love story of Mary and Matthew deserves the attention it gets, but the examination of all the relationships between all the characters is true, beautifully told.  The unfolding of the character of Thomas, a scheming person whose sexual identity tortures him, is as sensitive as it it devastating.  Julian Fellowes and his troupe of actors carry on the remarkable tradition of English theater - stories worth telling told with uncanny precision by actors with a vocation to bring truth to their work.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|if you think some of the love stories of today are messed up-  the Bronte sisters were writing<br />these tales long before anyone else!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game so fun and addicting and its for free so if you don't like it which is not likely you won't lose any MONEY so I recommend this game  highly  5 stars all the away
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Once again Sixto Rodriguez is on point with his lyrics.  I am certain anyone will be able to identify with his work.  Such a terrific writer and musician.  Hope he is able to release some additional work.<br /><br />His fame in South Africa astounds me.  He is larger than Elvis, the Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc.  His music inspired the oppressed in South Africa during the Apartheid time period...  Thanks Rodriguez for helping to set a nation free...
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game. I've spent days playing and steadily increasing my character's stats and equipment, etc. The only negative for me is my lack of coordination regarding the operation of the &ldquo;joystick&quot;.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Duhigg does a really nice job with this very readable primer in habit formation and habit change. I thought the book was excellent -- a keen mixture of science with story to embellish the main points.<br /><br />In terms of criticism, only one item comes to mind: Duhigg's weaving together of the example stories is a little bit clumsy. The seams were visible.<br /><br />Other than this one minor point, I thought the book was excellent.<br />I would recommend it to anyone -- practitioners and people who just want to work on improving their habits.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Blooms tower defense 5 is so cool  I love it when you get a lot are get.<br />To a high round it lags but still super fun
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Again, Sixto Rodriguez gets to the point in this album.  I recommend any song he has done.  It definitely strikes a chord with me.  It's funny how it took all these years for me to discover his work - did so after watching the 'Searching For Sugar Man' movie.  A very humble man!!!
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|A really absorbing book for me as both a scifi fan and as a former poor college physics student, that has developed a much bigger interest in that field as an adult.  Really looking forward to future books following the Akinya family further into their future.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is hilarious, serious, motivating and perfect in just the right ways! With great older tunes and even better present day songs, it appeals to audiences of all ages! Definitely recommend
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan and Sara have produced an energetic collection of pop-fused melodies on their album Heartthrob that contain an uncanny sound reminiscent of timeless songs from the eighties from artists such Cyndi Lauper and Roxette.  This record is not so much a departure from the duo's eclectic style that fans have grown accustomed to but rather a maturation of their creativity as artists and musicians - a step ahead of what they have been performing for over a decade.  Indeed, they have grown and the production on this record shows.<br /><br />Listeners may find a favorite tune in the set of ten tracks but all are worth a listen.  But for this listener, the undeniable comparisons are noticeable from not only the eighties genre but present day artists.  All of the tracks can easily be singles off the record, of course, the catchy \\"Closer\\" has already landed that distinction within mainstream radio, which has a tinge of Katy Perry or Keisha quality, especially in the chorus and driving beat and rhythm, \\"I'm Not Your Hero\\" is quite good and a bit of P!nk in the song, and back to the eighties,  think Cyndi Lauper for \\"How Come You Don't Want Me\\" and \\"Goodbye, Goodbye,\\" Roxette sounding \\"I Was a Fool,\\" and the Kate Bush-like \\"Shock to you System.\\"<br /><br />But aside from the comparisons, Heartthrob is a good album to add to one's playlist for listening pleasure, especially during a warm afternoon driving down the road with the volume turned up.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|great for the tablet, lots of fun! easy to play loads up quick great value for the money i spent
B008UTV6S8|5.0|fantastic I went to his concert in Auckland NZ same music same band so I had to own the CD now my family want  the same CD DVD. makes it easy for their birthday presents. Paul Simon is an incredible artist and he attracts amazing musicians as is evident in the talent of his band.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|....it works fine and does what you'd expect. There are a few \\"flaws.\\" One major flaw is that the silver knobs tend to loosen too easily. The other is that there wasn't any instruction guide. I found out how to work it watching videos on YouTube. Other than that, once you get how to work the weights and balances, this product works fine!
B00AEFXE9U|5.0|The bargain-rack movie for last night was \\"Almost Famous\\" (Widescreen Edition) starring Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup. I found it in the five-dollar  bin at a nearby Wal-Mart. It was well worth the cost. Good movie. I've been a Rock 'n' Roll ever since the genre came into existence in the mid-fifties. Plus, for me, that was just about the time of leaving the nest. This story is a multi-layered account of a family where the children are in the process of leaving the nest. First to go is the young daughter who becomes a flight attendant.The second departure is by the young son who is interested in being a Rock and Roll reporter. It's a coming of age  time and the main story concerns the son who gets tied up with a tour of Stillwater, a rising band in need of good press. Of course there are Band Aides (most of us would call them Groupies) and it's party, party, party with the son's nervous and protective mother following every move, albeit at a distance. It's a fun story, and very well put  together. If you've ever wondered what it might be like to be on the inside of a rock 'n' roll tour, well, this is probably as close as most of you will ever get.<br /><br />The movie is well put together.  It seems overly long, but I can't recognize anything that needs to be cut. The photography is excellent. The soundtrack is a wonderful rock and roll collage that would fall into the \\"oldies but goodies\\" category. The flow of the story is quite good. The acting is well done and I especially appreciated Kate Hudson, one of the tender young Band Aides. It's a fun and uplifting movie. If you like rock and roll, you should love this one. Be sure to look over the included extra materials as they add a lot to the telling of the story.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I was skeptical when I first heard about the show but the characters Sherlock Holmes and Watson are both superb. All the regular characters are great, good stories, serious with some humor. One if the best shows on tv today.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|love this game tons of fun.  got the free version on my kindle, but plan to download the full version on my ipad Monday.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Enjoyed this read. It was easy to read in small spurts as I would have a few minutes at different times to pick it up.
B001FB55L2|4.0|My bargain-rack movie for last night was \\"Brothers\\" starring Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was quite a good movie, but I found it less than satisfying, which I'll mention below. The \\"Brothers\\" was originally a Danish movie and was made over to better fit the situation of the United States. The movie concerned two brothers who were about the same age but were very different in personality and temperament. One was very successful (Maguire), a star football player who enlisted in the Marine Corps, and re-enlisted to fight the war in Afghanistan. The other (Gyllenhall) was a nehr-do-well, always in trouble, couldn't seem to stay with anything and even had to serve a short prison term. Now, guess which one their Korean War Marine Hero father preferred? I think you got it correct, and if you didn't, it would become crystal clear as the movie progressed.<br /><br />Maguire had a wife and two daughters who were delighted to see him again upon his return from Afghanistan, but he  didn't stay around long until his next re-enlistment. Then a series of events happened in short order. Maguire's helicopter was  shot down and he was presumed dead. The death notice went back to his family and the grief sank deeply in. Everyone began to adjust each in his or her own way. But wait! It turned out that Maguire and a second U. S. soldier survived the crash and were held captive by the enemy under dreary conditions. Maguire was ordered by the enemy commander to kill his loyal companion and friend. If he didn't, the commander would blow Maguire's brains out and he had already shown that he knew how to do it. Maguire took the easy and cowardly way out, he beat his companion to death with a piece of pipe. Shortly after this grisly little episode, a marine copter arrived, scattered the enemy and rescued Maguire. Well, you now had a bit of a psychological dilemma on your hands. Maguire returned home and, let's just say, he was less than well adjusted with being back. All sorts of problems surfaced, including a perceived problem between the two brothers and Maguire's wife. Everything went bad. It was a very interesting situation and one that might have taken place in many situations in America during this extended time of war. The problem with this movie, as I see it, is that it brought up this myriad of problems, but didn't solve them. There they were, all in your face and the movie was over. Surely, there could have been a more satisfactory ending to a dramatic and rather fine movie.<br /><br />Gary Petersonell adjusted with being back.

B001L1S1SK|4.0|A different version from the original (\\" Betty la fea\\") but the same as good and funny... Luv Wilhelmina, Amanda and Mark!!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I like that the timeline was intact and didn't really know it was a Q.T. movie till the end, and it was still ok.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|This is a terrific movie. Quite moving. I had to watch it for a grad school project. Since it was not available on instant view for Netflix, I decided to exercise my Amazon Prime movie thing. It was horrible, horrible, horrible. The stream was so bad as to make the movie nearly unwatchable. I have a high end system and I stream movies all the time from school and Netflix, among other sources and nary a problem. This is the second movie through Prime I have attempted to watch with the same result. Just awful.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I think this is meant as a way to get your coins from other games.  I don't recommend that you get this one.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I stumbled upon this product by accident and I'm glad I did. Love the ability to store favorites and build play/set lists..The autoscrolling feature is pretty cool also. Best app I have picked up this year for sure!!
B00B2166BS|5.0|very easy to hook to the nexus tab.  just slide it around and it snaps into place.  super easy to remove just push it off.<br />Faster charges takes about an hour to full charge a died battery
B005LHOKFS|1.0|I don't choose a hotel or an activity when I visit a new place before consulting its reviews on TripAdvisor. And I have to thank them for introducing me to the best scuba diving company ever (in the Cayman islands) but this app kept getting me frustrated every single time I used it on my Kindle and I deleted it. It crashed every time I used it while planning my next vacation, while checking hotels, reviews, activities. I even kept rebooting my kindle to see if it was that something was amiss but that did not help. I'm sad but until they make it work for the kindle I will not use it as I want to stay away from this that frustrated me so much.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|this show has great characters, great writing, fantastic special affects and will stand as one of the great scifi works of all time.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I am SO HOOKED on this silly game!!  I'm on level 83 now and it's HARD! Have had few issues with the game... only one has been a bit of lag as you fire once in awhile but it always fixes itself :)
B009NY43NY|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!  DON'T GO ANY FURTHER IF HAVE NOT READ:<br /><br />What is with all the negative reviews?  So excited to get the book on my Kindle and finished reading in two days.  Previously I would glance around the reviews but never fully reading as did not want to get spoiled, but braced myself for an awful read and let-down.  Because of all the negativity I assumed the worst possible of endings in my opinion (like Les Miz - everyone dies)  Au contraire - as stated in another positive review \\"it ended just as it should.\\"  Well, I loved it!  Everything and everyone covered; great plot(s) and story, and all is good in my world, and Sookie's.  Great job Ms. Harris; love your worlds and writings and thank you for their creation and sharing.  Going to miss the Sookie Universe but look forward to what comes next!
B0064MGU98|4.0|Sometimes the stroy-line is not developed as much as you want it to be, but overall it's a good show. I keep watching it. The lead actress is good, so that counts for a lot.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|this show deserved another year, it had finally found its way. i would love to see how it all ended.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found this book just slightly difficult to follow. The story has some twists and turns that helped to hold my attention and yet I personally did not feel that it flowed as smoothly as it should have or could have.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I was in the mood for a thiller. This was a great read. I liked the storyline and the characters. I am looking  forward o reading more from this author.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|my kids wanted me to get this. we enjoyed it very much. great choice. would recommend to other friends for the holidays.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Hello.  This is a fantastic movie.  I am not a fan of Iron Man 2 and I will likely not see 3.  I have never seen the Hulk in any incarnation and I saw about 20 minutes of Thor.  Captain America was fun.  I came to see this Marvel incarnation only because of Joss.  Like all movies there are flaws and loopholes and such in the story but small things aside this is a captivating movie.  It brings you into the world and effectively tells a story for each hero while managing to spin them all together into a final climax.  It does a good job of getting by the fact that Captain America, Hawk Eye and the Black WIdow are useless compared to Iron Man, the Hulk and Thor.  The graphics are great, the villains are evil, albeit stupid, and the movie ends with a good lead in to the next in the series.  I hope the next film is as good and I hope that it is not named Avengers 2.  I hate it when movies put a number after the title.  Just use secondary titles.  For example Indian Jones and the Last Crusade.  Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom.  Indian Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark.  The entire Harry Potter series.  The Lord of the RIngs.  They have independent titles that are descriptive and fun.  Movies seems more like a greedy ploy when you just slap on a digit to the original title.  It lacks creativity.  Men in Black(good movie)  MIB 2 MIB 3.  Couldn't they come up with subnames like Men In Black: The Space Princess and Men In Black: Time Travel Adventure.  Anyway i could go on for a bit but more to the point.....<br />Enjoy Avengers, its got laughs, crys and funs.
B00BD62X14|5.0|Very beautiful voice - and to think she was the Firsti Lady of France.  I enjoy the CD....she does a nice job. Recommend it highly f one likes French music and a lovely voice.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book shows you just exactly what is capable of your subconscious mind, going into more detail than I have ever seen in a book before.<br /><br />If you read this book, and absorb the methods others have used that are described within you will see amazing changes in your life.<br /><br />Following these principles I have created my own home based business and will have my first six figure income year next year, well on to make my first million by 2015.<br /><br />I am also in the absolute best shape of my life and live every day to the fullest with a positive and happy outlook.<br /><br />It all starts in your mind, master it, and you master your life. Everything in your life is a reflection of what is inside you, this book shows you how to change the way you look at yourself and the world within, so that you see it reflected on the outside.<br /><br />Very powerful.
B002KYXO7A|5.0|Watched with my 8yo daughter, she loved it! Very funny! Great movie for kids. Best dance scenes. What talent! Have watched this movie several times.
B0097K21YW|5.0|Better than I thought, I am addicted to these 'Birds&#34; type of games. NOT loaded with Ad-ware, which makes it a premium choice.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love movies that move along and hold my interest, which this did from beginning to end. Can't wait to see the next one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love looking at pinterest all the time and now I have an app that I can look at it and find what we'll have for meals and fun activities with my kids
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game. easy to play I can spend hours with this game. my grand children often play this while waiting at appointments
1446249182|5.0|This is simply the best textbook for statistics for social sciences. Field makes it fun. Although the childhood image at the beginning of each chapter makes him seem self-absorbed, it's forgivable. After all, he really did a good job explaining things. My students find it very helpful. So do I.<br />The only thing that was less than optimal was that the companion website for the 4th edition still wasn't ready long after the book was purchased.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It was really fun and it is a good game for kids because it's fun and entertaining. I think this game will become even better but there are some things they need to work on.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This is a great classic and the story line has held up well throughout the years!  A must have for movie buffs
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I liked the third version of dungeon hunter but this version is more dynamic and it has a better story line to it.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was well written and captivating in every page. I was drawn in from the very beginning. The story felt so raw and so real! Such a good book I highly recommend this book!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I loved this series, but wished it had continued.  I would recommend this series to any one who is into history
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I saw many people didn't like the ending, but I really thought it captured the characters and was a great ending to a great series.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun game, it's better than Clash Of Clans. Everyone should get it. you can do anything on this game it's awesome.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I like this book because it tells about a kids journal and I like reading journal's  as really awesome book!!!!!!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|the lifeproof case was terrible it messed up the sound of my ringtone.the screen was freezing up<br />and it dropped callls.so many little problems.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I chose this rating because it is one of the best books I have ever read.  It incorporates so many emotions and really keeps you involved and makes you emotionally attached to characters whether it is in a positive or negative manner.  I don't really have anything negative to say about this book.  This series is a must read!!!!!!
B00AECDDYY|4.0|The app is fun but most of the levels start feeling the same. That being said, it is worth playing. Thank you.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|We need more of this type of guy running around to help combat the growing violence in America!  And my cousin was in the movie!  I'm not saying there should be vigilantes, but the police(being a former cop) could use the help.  Especially when private citizens are afraid to get involved.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|This is my personal opinion on this movie; however, everyone is different and may hate this movie.<br /><br />I thought it was a pretty dang good movie, great humor; however, it was pretty vulgar and had a lot of obscenities. (they don't bother) No real complaints, well made movie with mindless humor and violence.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really liked this app. It is very fun. I like to do a bunch of things at once,  and with this app's three lanes, there's not a boring moment. If you're reflexes aren't very good, this game is not for you.
B0061S073A|5.0|The creator of this app needs an award for saving my children. We installed this app after my son restored my wife's Kendle Fire. Harmony has been restored to our house! Works without a flaw.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|Since this movie came out, I have always enjoyed this movie!  I have it on all 3 versions of media available & the Blu Ray is the best yet.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Like most of Baldacci's books this is a good thriller, kept my attention right up to the unexpected ending you'll like it too
082300659X|5.0|I have learned a lot about drawing from other sources, but if I was going to try to teach someone to draw I would use this as the text and if I needed pithy quotes to reinforce an important concept I would pull them all from here.<br /><br />If I had this as a beginner without help I would have floundered with it, though. It is intermediate to advanced as a stand alone text.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Continues where book one left off with surprising choices by the children during the WWII period. Can't wait for Book three. I really liked the section about the Spanish Civil War.<br />'
B001XCWPAM|5.0|Everyone turns a blind eye to what really goes on in the real world, well this kind of stuff does!  We need more &#34;Matt Damon's&#34; to break free of the cycle & bring it to light of how our Government works.

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I have been reading this series for the better part of 20 years.  Each new book I eagerly await and usually devour over a free days.  This was a great read focusing on Ivan for a chance where he finally gets the girl...

B009NY43NY|1.0|Such a boring book and dull ending. I was expecting much more even the so called exciting parts were boring. I really do not know how I feel maybe the point is to get you to purchase the last book for a resolution on what happens to everyone. This was so anti climactic.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I haven't been this addicted to a TV show since Ozzie and Harriet.  It's clever, well plotted, and decent fun.  I'm much happier investing in a DVD series than watching the trash that airs on prime time network TV.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Wasn't sure where the show was going when it first started, but I stuck with it and glad I did! It is an awesome show that twists and turns. Love it!
B001DM1VXE|4.0|I was mesmerized by this movie from the start.Done in black and white,it has a dream quality about it.I would recommend it to a friend.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Easy and fun game. Kids love it and are having fun feeding fish and collecting items.<br />Good clean fun for all ages.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a simple calculator with BIG numbers and this calculator has them. If you are middle age and need BIG fonts to read, get this. You'll love it.

Please do not support or buy Bobbi Brown products or any other cosmetic house who sells in China. Even if they say not tested on animals, if they sell to China it is their law to test on poor defenseless animals. [...]
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was my favorite Disney movie when I was little, and now I am able to share it with my 3-yr-old little girl. She loves this movie now too! Princesses are very popular right now, and she especially loves this movie!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this serial adapter so I could update the firmware on a Morningstar TS-45 Tristar solar charge controller using my mid-2012 Non-Retina MacBook Pro.  The firmware updater from Moringstar only runs under Windows 95 or later, so I ran Windows 7 under VMware Fusion on my Mac.  The serial adapter worked perfectly with this combination.<br /><br />Excellent product.<br />Incredibly low price.<br />I LOVE Amazon Prime!
B009UZBLSG|1.0|the wiring is pretty cheap. if you are using it in the car or any where the cable will get twisted, expect a short  :plife. first snow and static then total fail. Amazon took the return, but now the price has doubled so forget getting a replacement too. :p
B004TSKKE0|3.0|It's a commonplace to say that Foster Wallace was a genius, and it's probably true. I'm just not sure that his particular brand of genius was suited to fiction. As the critic James Wood has pointed out, Infinite Jest is all about information not character. If a novel informs me that's great, but I also want to be impassioned by it in some way - if I merely wanted to be informed I'd read a non-fiction book. Admittedly these are personal preferences, but I would argue that IJ's mix of literary realism, satire and science fiction fails in its own terms. While some of its observations about information technology, for example, are prescient, the talk of \\"cartridges\\" and \\"CD Roms\\" just sounds silly in a novel supposedly set in the 21st century. What made me give up reading around page 250, however, was a passing reference to the way that US veterans hospitals had emptied due to the persistent lack of wars since Vietnam. At its best, science fiction is visionary and strange - IJ, though undoubtedly extraordinary in its own way, is just too specific and topical, and as a result feels dated in a way that those paired 20th century classics Brave New World and 1984 do not.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Fox got this one wrong!  They didn't give Joss and Tim a chance.  Fox doomed Firefly before the first episode was aired.<br />Watch Firefly and you will become a Browncoat.  It's addicting.
B0080R3YIU|5.0|I bought this book originally in the 1980's and somehow lost track of it.  Now I have it back and I enjoy it as much or more as I did the first time.  It's a good introduction to the concepts of Taoism via the Winnie the Pooh books.  Cleverly written and entertaining.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This came up in the recommended/you might be interested stuff.  The short synopsis seemed OK - there might be some intrigue, mystery, danger... something.  Nope.<br /><br />To be fair, if you like sticky (both figurative and literally) romances, this is probably a great read. If you long for the days of post-adolescent young love when five minutes of not communicating meant the end of the world, this book will transport you there.  In spades.<br /><br />However, if you recall those times of continuous butterflies in your stomach with mild embarrassment, move on. Even more so if you have those friends (and we all do) who do the, \\"Goodbye... No you hang up first. I CAN'T hang up first, you have to.  OK.  On three... one...two...three.... You're still there! No, I love YOU. I love you more. No, you can't love me more than anything because that would mean it's more than I love you, and I love YOU more than anything... OK, hangup....\\" and you wish to strangle them.<br /><br />I often had to choke back my own vomit as well as the urge to break my Kindle.  The novel really is a series of sicky-sappy interactions between two young, hormonal college students (and their young, hormonal friends). For the first part of the novel I had myself convinced it was just some Big Buildup designed to Lure Me In before The Big Thing Happens, like a kidnapping, murder, dual-identity, crisis, aliens... something.  But nope.  Typical of those times, the characters in the book (they're all dating each other) are hopeless in love, screwing like rabbits, and then violently break up over the oddest things - often on the same page.  Lather, rinse, repeat for an entire novel.<br /><br />So why two stars do you ask?  Gentle Review Reader, I shall tell you:<br /><br />First, it isn't terribly written. That is to say, the prose is nice, easy, quick.  The book does a really good job of transporting you there and evoking the feelings. Again, I wanted to strangle the characters - all of them - for being so annoying.  However, it's an 'annoying' that I remember well, and see repeated amongst younger co-workers and older co-workers with older children.<br /><br />If you are looking for a torrid, suck-you-in romance novel involving bad boys and a not-so-good girl, you'll probably like this.  Meanwhile, I'm going to go gargle with some Listerine.g so annoying.

0345444051|3.0|This is one of those old chestnuts that hasn't fared well with the passage of time. Pretty good writing though a bit pretentious at times, goofy plot... it's a work written when scope was king-- e.g. it's Ace paperback material in VistaVision. You'll see overtones recapitulated in \\"2001\\", and some of Clarke's oceanography background surfaces, but ultimately, books like this are part of the problem in terms of perceiving sci-fi as literature. Dated. Preposterous. Boring.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very cute game. Pretty much farmville with Nemo characters.  Just wish you could use the sanddollars to buy pearls and alge instead of having to use real money. But really don't have to buy anything of your patient.

0439023521|5.0|I read this on Kindle, but I bought the hard copies for my mother for mother's day. She'd been wanting to read them, and I really like to get off the wall and unusual gifts that will actually be used. She's already started reading them (they came really quick, even with shipping problems).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book really tied the whole series together and kept you sucked in. Once I started it, I didn't want to put it down but at the same time I didn't want to finish reading it because I wanted the story to go on forever. Great book, I would recommend it to anyone!
0615782043|4.0|I have the honor and priveldge to actually know this story teller. So when I read his words I could hear him performing these beautifully written peices in my head. I get to think about the author and his words in a very authentic way.<br />I think that because of my personal relationship to the author I am biased. I love the experiencial, I love being a part of his audience in a very hands on way.<br />GPA is a gifted and talented poet/storyteller. He has a very primal, erotic reletionship with his words. And he has that relationship with the women he is speaking to and about. He is one of those men that really loves women and cherishes the feminine. It's rare. And it creates a relationship with the printed and spoken word that I don't often come across.<br />If I didn't know better, I'd think he was speaking to me and when I read his work I can only imagine that he is.<br />Clearly, I love this work and look forward to more. Thank you, GPA for including me in your harem if only in my mind.
B004JHYRP4|4.0|A really interesting storyline. Three different places well developed. The structure of the alternative universe was great, and showed wonderful imagination. A challenging read, but worth the effort.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have finally found a well adapted movie.  I'm so glad the books are still coming and there is no end in sight.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I got over a thousand wife points for the first three seasons of Downton Abbey as a Mothers Day gift. My wife loves period films and she was bowled over by the tremendous acting, costumes and drama. She never had a chance to see the series on PBS and she watched one DVD after another for hours and hours.

B007FIY3VW|4.0|As with any app that uses the keyboard on a Kindle, it is very cumbersome and frustrating. However I do like it as it is very similar to the MS products I use every day. Emailing docs is nice to receive on the Kindle and at home.

B008476HBM|5.0|That is about it.  It is a classic novel with fantastic and timeless characters.  A wonderful must read for anyone who enjoys classic period novels.  Thanks Jane
125000098X|2.0|I really liked the 1st two books in this series and was really excited to get the newest chronicle. This book leaves much to be desired. It is a good story as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. I could not believe how abruptly it ended! It was like starting a book, getting into the characters and plot only to find the last 50 pages are missing. I fear Archer is going the way of James Patterson: he used to write terrific books but now only seems to want to get them to the market. Archer needs to work on his cliff-hanger skills. I will read the next book in this series but I may not be so eager to fork out the money to pre-order.
B00785P2QC|1.0|its fun I just think u should be able to archive points more easily other than that its a really fun game
B00BMT9SQA|4.0|It was a very funny light hearted movie. I saw myself and my son in so many of the scenes.

B00AQB2A3I|4.0|When I shop for music, I look for two things:<br /><br />  1) Spectacular prog rock that uniquely takes you somewhere<br /><br />  2) Banal lyrical references to the world of Tolkien<br /><br />And let me say that I only got half of what I was looking for.<br /><br />There is not a *single* reference to Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Trolls, Treants, Wargs, Nazgul, or Uruk-hai on the entire album.  There are no rings, dark lords, white wizards, giant spiders, or undead warriors to speak of.  And not a single disintegrating cavern, mountain fortress, white city or evil volcano in sight.  I checked the liner notes for an all-seeing eye, and all I got was some spooky moon face that clearly has no designs on conquering and enslaving Middle Earth.<br /><br />I. Could. Go. On.<br /><br />That said, the music's not bad.  Lovely, really.<br /><br />But, missing one key element, I have to feel like it's an opportunity lost.<br /><br />Better luck next time, Steven.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />The City of Los Angeles
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful. Couldn't put it down. An interesting twist in a love story and makes you appreciate what you have. Enjoy.
1594744769|5.0|I was at Barnes & Noble and saw this as one of the best-sellers in the Teen section, and it seemed interesting so I figured I would give it a shot. And I'm glad I did! It's a very interesting concept that I haven't read about before and I read the book in only a couple days (which is pretty short for me). Loved the photos incorporated within each chapter, it really added another layer to the already good story.
0452289963|5.0|a must have for all people who love themselves, life, people and everything around you. Even for those who are alien to what it means to love yourself... It's not a selfhelp book, it's information and becoming more aware... Essential..
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|very good calculator. big buttons for typing numbers.a must for kindle users.get it and enjoy. calculator plus free. very  good
B001FB4W0W|5.0|My girl friend got me to watch this show with her, and I was hooked quick, first five-ten mins seemed stupid, but give it a Episode or two, It dragged me in so good, next day I was at walmart buying seasons 23&4 we watched them all round the the clock in less then a week.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read! I was immediately sucked into this post-apocalyptic silo world. As soon as I finished this I bought the second book, the &#34;Shift Omnibus&#34;, and I can't wait for the third to come out later this year.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I would like it and in college (aka poor) so I downloaded &#34;Wool-Part I&#34; on my kindle since it was free and decided to purchase the whole book when I finished. If you don't have a kindle download a kindle app or use the kindle cloud reader.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Leaves you thinking right to the very end, lots of twists and turns where you don't know what it going to happen next.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|I have had a full-blown RC SIM on my PC for many years.  To be able to have a similar SIM on my Android tablet, and have it work so well, that really speaks for progress and innovation!  Of course, it has its limitations but it provides the user with a genuine thrill similar to flying RC on your PC!<br /><br />It's a bit disconcerting to me, however, to be compelled to purchase additional planes and air fields, etc. on an a-la-carte basis.  But, in the end, it's the only prescribed way to build up your fleet of planes, boats, and sir fields!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|We really liked the film.  Who doesn't like Johnny Depp. In the future we will consider ordering more movies thank you.
0345803485|5.0|Good book to read. Nice story. Draws the reader into the story. I really enjoyed this book and plan to get the next in the series.
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|Never was able to download it, never tried.I'm sorry i could not give you any kind of review for this product
B00B1MHA18|5.0|Most songs have that almost Robert Johnson feel with a clean finish. I enjoy when an artist (Musselwhite) doesn't have the need to showboat their talent to get the feel accross. A good blend of old and new blues styles.
B000NY12LO|4.0|I thought the topic of the book was timely (bullying) - this was one book that once I started it I could not put it down.<br />Good characters, interesting topic,she tries to share both perspectives in the way that &#34;Dead Man Walking&#34; did.<br /><br />All high school kids should read this.
0470901071|5.0|Preparing for the CCNA, this is a must have. With the CD and extra videos this will help refresh your memory.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is a great historical ride. Perfect if you love Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Chronicles! I recommended it to all the history buffs out there.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I just had to lol I grew up playing Pac-Man and of course Ms. Pac-Man (which was cooler) So I thought I'd bust out my mad Pac-Man playing skills and give it a try.. well needless to say after 20 years my mad skills have faded a little but it was still fun and works pretty good with your fingers or a stylus pen.<br /><br />Cool NAMCO BANDAI thanks for the memories!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I read lots of reviews and yes lots of them with spoilers before purchasing this book.  I had to read it, even knowing I wasn't going to get the ending I was hoping for, because it was the last book in a much loved series.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />To be honest, I really ended up enjoying the novel.  I am a sucker for a love story and I absolutely adored Eric as a character and a love interest for Sookie.  This being said, in DAA Harris reminded me that at his core Eric is a cold and calculating character, qualities that allowed him to survive over 1000 years in the first place and qualities that will keep him alive for at least another millennium!  Everything Eric did in this book made sense; I really do think he loved Sookie to the highest degree he was able, however in the end he chose politics over love.  If Sookie had to use the cluviel dor to keep Eric from Oklahoma I actually do think the happy ending so many of us were hoping for would have been tainted.  And if Eric had defied his maker and sacrificed his political ambitions for Sookie, well looking back at the series, that just wouldn't have been true to his character.<br /><br />I don't see the extra 100 years he adds to his marriage contract to protect Sookie to be all that big of a deal.  Some readers claim that Harris paid Eric no regard and sentenced him a a tragic ending, alone in Oklahoma without Sookie, Pam, or any of his people.  But the truth is that an extra 100 years is a drop in the bucket of time for Eric. If you (like I do) believe that he was ultimately going to marry Oklahoma even though he loved Sookie, it only makes sense to see Eric as the master of his own fate.  He set the terms, agreed to the deal, and I suspect it made him happy to move forward having done as much as he could to protect a woman he loved a lot but not enough to risk his status in the vampire world or accept that she would never agree to become like him, a vampire.  Eric is a survivor and if the uncanny resemblance between Pam and Karin and Sookie tells us anything it is that he will not spend eternity alone and longing for Sookie.<br /><br />So as I said, I would have LOVED a happy ending with Eric BUT the ending Harries chose to write does make sense and is in its own way satisfying.
B000001F5A|5.0|The music is so beautiful. Very relaxing to listen to if you have had a stressful day but the movie is sad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great addition (free) for those quick calculations you run into when least expected.  Downloaded quickly, simple to use.  Good app.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Great book! Just the right amount of humor to make any age laugh out loud! Smooth plot, ongoing action, and tons of fun!!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I loved the series but this left me feeling sad. To many characters returning with no real role, Eric was around for 3, maybe 4 pages, the wolves maybe 2 and Pam for a blink of the eye. The other point of view made it read in a different voice, just didn't fit.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|The tunes are silky smooth and it is swell to hear Boz' great voice again.  Nice variety of selections. An enjoyable collection.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This new version is awful! I am going to uninstall and look for something better. I really liked the old version.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so much fun! A LOT better than the first, and I loved the first! The graphics are better, the environment more appealing to the eye; and of course there are mines and ropes and other cool things as well. Also, if you trip up and the monkey gets closer(there's just one big monkey instead of many little ones), then he blocks out less of your vision then the other monkeys do.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|Zombieland is a wonderful mix of horror and comedy that makes the movie fun and exciting to watch. The characters chosen to play the roles of the wandering survivors could not have been a better choice. the cameo was surprising and really added to the whole story line. Well done for a zombie flik!
B00B18MQ7K|4.0|Very creative tunes and great music on the cd.  Great mixing on the soundtracks.  We enjoy listening over and over.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had no idea this book would have as much intrigue in it as it did.  The author did a great job of making this a well rounded book with more than just sex in it.  A must read for everyone.
0767827791|5.0|I loved watching Picnic again. It brought back great memories of my first real date with a boy. I was so infactuated with him and those butterflies reappeared for a few moments.
B005OOL1IC|1.0|My movie going experience in my lifetime has been awesome. Lots of bad movies too. This is where The Hangover II comes into picture. The first one was so funny, this one was just plain, flat-out gross & stupid. I can handle a lot of crude humour, but crude movies like this, It's gotta be good according to my taste. The characters are all back in Part II, but they should of gone elsewhere for a better movie script. The one person I TRULY HATED in this film, is actor Zach Galifianakis's character Alan, he was a down right rude, sad, whiny little sod. He kept being a total pain in the you know where, the way he kept staring at people, & the way he treated Teddy in the film, was ridiculous. How can this actor, play a moronic character that is so mean, rude, & just plain stupid? Onto the movie itself. It lost all of the first one's funny bone, 10-15 mins into it. I wanted to press the stop button on my Blu-Ray Remote, after the scene where Alan throws the neck comforter, or whatever it was, away at the Airport. The scene when they go to the Thailand Strip Bar, was disgusting. The whole film, had humour in it, that was never really funny. Director Todd Phillips, if you direct Part III, please make a better script that has no deadbeats in the film. Yes, I'm talking about YOU, Alan.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This final book in the series did not disappoint and was everything I hoped for.  It had the right balance of intrigue, passion, mystery, and drama.  It did not disappoint!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|its not really that fun for a adult. it seems that can be a way to make it more interesting.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game is fun and addictive although, once ya hit the elf level or what have you you have to use rl money to play so it kind of sucks the fun out of the game. but it is a good game to pass the time.
0062200909|5.0|this was awesome i love this movie and i love the art book more . I can not wait for the next set of art books.

193700788X|1.0|I have been a HUGE fan of the Sookie books, the last book was terrible however I was hopeful.  I struggled to read Dead Ever After and was horrified and disgusted with the total disregard for her characters and could see a complete lack of effort and enthusiasm in the writing.  This could have ended so wonderfully / controversially anything but completely boring and totally disconnected from the wonderful series up until book ten.  I would be ashamed to put my name on the cover.  Charlaine has sold out for the money and her disrespect for her loyal fans is a slap in the face.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|This album took me a couple of listens for it to grow on me. And it is officially a favourite album of mine. It has a certain heaviness to it that all HIM fans love. The only thing I will complain about is the booklet that comes with the album doesn't have the lyrics in it. So I'll be singing along to it with some of the wrong words haha!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of dystopian novels, though few pull it off well. One of the great aspects of this book is that Ernest Cline doesn't spend a ton of time explaining what happened or detailing the machine. The people come first, and the daily escape that they inhabit, a technology of such promise sits at  the forefront for so long, that the intrusion of the real world is jarring for character and reader alike. I'm also of a great age to personally relate to the computer, gaming and media trivia baked into every scene, which kept the story flowing and enjoyable.
B004JUSDVU|5.0|Saw it once before and I loved it... Looked for it all over and couldn't find it... Until now. I can't wait to buy it and own this movie.... I really want to add it to my collection.lol
B004478AS4|4.0|Nothing better to take a look of African life. A different novel style. How important the ancestor's knowledge is to a village in Africa.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a good book, great story teller.  It ended in what appeared to be a set up for a sequel, or for several sequels, but rather than end it in mid tension as some writers do, she resolved the first story's tension, leaving room for more story.  Some day I will go look for the sequels.
0385535147|3.0|If I were running through an airport to make a long flight, I wouldn't hesitate to stop at the book kiosk and pick up a John Grisham novel.  And maybe that's the problem. A brilliant, thoroughly entertaining author who unfortunately has over-written this crime novel into a convoluted and completely unbelievable thriller.  The main plot depends on so many uncontrollable events turning out in the protagonist's favor that it renders itself impossible--without the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The author's comments on the federal government's abuse of power, corruption at various levels, and the blatant waste of taxpayer money is a consistent message throughout this story.  It is enough to bring tears to your eyes. A sad but true commentary on how our government has changed over the years.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Really great story line and very addictive. Always want to know what will the next chaper contains.. I Recomend it to anyone.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love the way things worked out in this book! I'm glad I read this series. I'm going to check out the other books by Charlaine Harris.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I haw been a follower of Jethro Tull since the early 70's.  I have the original vinyl.  My CD version got borrowed by my son so I thought I would order another one for me.  I was pleasantly suprised that this version was the origional plus an interview and several extra songs.  I thoroughly enjoy the CD.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A very well done story of sacrifice, love, inner turmoil, the dark side of humanity, and the struggles of making the right choices when the options are all in question.<br /><br />A few areas I thought were not appropriate for younger teens, but I think it could be a very thought provoking book for most. Parents should read this and then engage their kids in conversation about the issues the books raise.<br /><br />As an adult, I thought it was a great read.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Sorry to see Sookie go but the last few books have been disappointing. I am sorry that I paid so much for the last few books and they have been so bad. MS Harris would have never made it without Sookie. I will not buy other books by this author. I have been getting much better books for a lot less on my kindle
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love it, but wish you could play offline. Will give it 5 stars then. Do not understand why most of Disney's apps require online playing.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Look, bag it is a great app BUT when I bought it MONTHS ago it was only 99&cent; and now it's 1.99$ and it hasn't been updated this entire time!!! So these jerks are just raising the price for nothing. I have been waiting for new levels for MONTHS!!!!!! WHO'S WITH ME!!!!!!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|You will not regret seeing this movie trust me. It can't be compared to any other movie. Its for all types of movie lovers, most people would probably assume its a chic flick, but it is far from it.
B005SV9X22|5.0|Takes me back to the Monster Ball concert with Gaga- a great night in my life!!! I would def. recommend this dvd to anyone!
B004PGO25O|5.0|An encouraging book for students of life and a meaningful follow-up to &#34;The War of Art&#34; by the same author.
B008G12ERC|5.0|One of my favorite bands of all time. Went to see them in concert this year and there are no words to explain how amazing they are.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|It's been said that no language can express the full power of a mother's love.  It shrinks not where man cowers, grows stronger where man faints, and shines the fire of its quenchless fidelity like a shooting star.  That is the depth of a mother's love.  But what happens when that natural, pure, loving instinct is thwarted?  That twisted answer is at the heart of this frightening movie.  Scary movies are my 'thing,' and it's so rare to find a truly ingenious one that can capture my attention...and hold it.  \\"Mama\\" is such a movie.  I was captivated from the first scene to the ending credits.  This movie is destined to become a horror classic.
193700788X|5.0|If you did not see this ending coming then you are a poor reader.<br />In many ways Sookie is like a teenager in the first book.  So many young women start out dating those oh so attractive James Dean/ rebel without cause  boys. In real life we only get hurt emotionally, but her life is constantly endangered. She ends up with a guy who is a little cooler than average, but he isn't involved in any drama about politics and hierarchies. No kingdoms, packs, etc means a better possibility for a reasonably normal adult life.. Did we really want Sookie to end up like Bella?  Shudder. Or worse yet like Anita Blake, who has gone over the edge so badly in recent books that she would be better off as a vamp? It would be interesting to have a storyline where a character with some fairy blood becomes a vamp, to see what would happen, but that could be done in a Sookieverse short story.  And the Sam and Sookie  fairy / shifter child will be interesting. To readers who think this ending was too tame, I advise looking beyond the obvious. I am glad she can have her own kids and  won't have to settle for a special relationship with Hunter.<br /><br />Many readers complain that Harris was not true to her depiction of Eric as the great love of Sookie's life.  Careful readers will also note that Harris had been building for this ending step by step, showing us a slowly growing flame between Sam and Sookie. And a slow dying of the love Sookie felt for Eric.  Sexual attraction is not the same as love.  And please look back to note: Sam (or the collie) also has  been there to protect Sookie at key moments.  But, he doesn't live a crazy violent life that constantly put  her in danger in the first place and for that I say hooray.  Also, Eric has been horribly selfish in the past, such as when he forced Sookie into the marriage she did not want. That was for political reasons as much as what passes for love among vamps. Many readers depict Eric as weakened and defanged, as Freyda's helpless toy.  Please.  His ambition was stronger than his love.  It happens.<br /><br />I also liked the non romantic aspects of the happy ending, Sookie finally winning acceptance and support from the town that had so stigmatized her.<br />My only complaint was introducing the Devil, a brand new variety of supe,  in the very last book. I did not like that even though the resulting plot line was well done. She could have let us know this kind of supe existed in an earlier book.<br /><br />In conclusion, most of us readers did not end up with that bad boy we dated.  Or if we did we divorced him!!!  Harris' universe is fantasy but at the same time has always been realistic psychologically.  Only in a bad Harlequin romance would Eric change enough to  be a good life partner.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a classic in the making.  If you haven't already, read the books.  Good for grown ups as well as children.
1401233791|5.0|The product arrived right on the scheduled time and it's all the I have expected! Batman beaten by Bane is something that every Batman fan should have on their own collection!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This is a good product I've been using it for a little over 5 months now, and I finally think it's time to write a review. It's a good mouse in terms of customization it has a lot of features that you can't get at any other price point. At first, the mouse feels light and cheap, but for me it was just fine. Everything works great only problems I have with it are that the weight tuning cartridge doesn't come out as easily, and the mouse wheel sometimes glitches up otherwise great mouse. Would recommend to other buyers looking for this many features at this price point.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have used the NIV Study Bible for many years and thought I would never use another version. However, the ESV Study Bible has become my primary version over the last year or so. The information contained in the various commentary sections and  introductions to each book is useful. The maps and charts are particularly helpful.  I am able to move easily from the text to the notes and cross references. I use the ESV Study Bible extensively both in my personal study and in my preparation for teaching our Ladies Sunday School class.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hugh Howey has come up with a great concept and delivers great pacing and character-building in this series.  His characters are fully realized in each book--full of the best and worst of this slice of humanity. The reader will find himself drawn into this world and its inhabitants because of his excellent and evocative writing.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to anyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am very impressed this is differnt from anything I would have expected.  I like the graffics and the game seams to change alot making if quite fun still learning what all to do but doors keep opening.  Looking for a fun time killer give it a try
B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlaine Harris should be ashamed of this work and the last book as well.  There is little substance and I would request a refund if it were possible.<br /><br />This author would have been better to take a few years off to figure something out than to push out such drivel.<br /><br />I kept pushing on, thinking that it would take off, like all the other books, .....but then realized I was almost done.<br /><br />I know that this is purportedly the last book, but I sense a marketing scheme and vow not to fall for it when it appears someday in the future.<br /><br />Fans, save your money.  This author didn't even take the time to write something her fans would enjoy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was/is a great game. Thought provoking and challenging without  being frustrating. The graphics are phenomenal and beautiful as is the music. Can't wait for more rooms from whomever your wonderful brain-i-acs are. Thank you.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|loved everything about this soundtrack! if you liked metal gear rising i would say get this and if you played the game then you know what im talking about.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great read, a real page turner. Our book club all agreed it was one to share with others. Did NOT see the ending coming at all!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was the best move of the year, not Argo. It had it all, and the cast provided some of the best acting I have seen in a long while. Anyone of them could have won best actor (although of course one did). A must see.
B009IA9OLE|2.0|The only good thing about the game is that it runs smoothly on my old Kindle Fire. I was expecting a court game like Phoenix Wright on Nintendo. However, the game doesn't require you to use any logics to win the case. Rather, you just need to choose which attacks to use on your opponent like when you play Pokemon.
193700788X|1.0|All the gushers and obvious intern/employeee reviewers are saying \\"love the series\\" ... but what specifically, in detail, did you love about this particular book? Give us one example of the writing that was worthy of 5 stars.  Everyone is entitled to his opinion, but those are not reviews of this story, THIS book. I didn't want to read it, i really didn't. The continuity is non-existent. The inconsitencies throughout. The story is non-sensical. The characters act out of character. The plot goes nowhere. The dialogue is generic. The cheap devices are ridiculous. This book could have been written by someone who never even read the prior books. And if this particular book is judged on its own merits, one star is one star too many.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|A wonderful album filled with familiar tunes. Smooth jazz at its best.  You can tune it in or tune it out when you need to concentrate on something else.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool I love it its so fun I also like how they have cool people to buy its so cool
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I think many parts of this book could have been deleted without affecting the story line. Even though it was a very long story, it was worth reading. I did like the price. It was free.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|I  like how the movie is not like the game but all the game characters make it to the movie
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book, SO MUCH!!! DO NOT read if you have not read The Hunger Games or Catching Fire. I would recommend this book to you!:):):)
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is your basic alarm clock - I got this to work on my Kindle Fire so when I finish reading at night I can set the alarm for the next day without moving. Not looking for anything fancy - just our nuts and bolts alarm clock which is what it does.
B000OCXIDK|3.0|I purchased this book just a few weeks after seeing the movie, hoping to find more insight into the life of Vermeer and his time.  I am disappointed.  The novel is not greatly written.  With a few exceptions, the story describes the life of this girl, but not much more.  Her simple thoughts are, well, simple and her inner life consists in simple emotions (sadness, jealousy, obedience).  Some paragraphs are poetic and gives a life to the page, but, sadly, most of the book is bed to bed story.<br /><br />I understand we don't know much about Vermeer, but then, I would think it is the novelist's job to make up for it.  Vermeer's time was not middle age and although survival was the primary goal of the working class, there must have been more to the story than what we are given here.  Was the book a movie script?  Most definitely.  That I saw Colin Firth acting in this book is a nice plus, that I could easily imagine Scarlett Johansen as the Girl, great!, but it somehow left me with wanting to know more.  The only thing I can say now is that I read it.  Next!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was a little apprehensive a first as I was used to Logitech, which was compact wireless and portable.  However, after about 30 seconds, I could tell, I was going to like this mouse.  Smooth, responsive and extremely comfortable, it scrolled across the screen with ease for general use and yet was precise in small movements in design applications.  The scroll wheel spins smooth without hesitation or rough spots.  While the mouse had a perfect weight for me, it comes with a number of extra weights, which elegantly, can weight your mouse, to meet your needs.  The fact that it is corded is irrelevant.  Without doubt, the best mouse I've owned or used.
1416511946|5.0|Loved reading every minute and was  hard to put down  vince is honest crazy brillant fun and drop dead georgeous
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Fun and Entertaining It has just the right amount of Difficulty to keep you playing and I really hate the carb nebula now.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Any show or movie that spends as much time as this one does to quality story lines and character development can only be great!
B001NLKT60|2.0|This second offering in the &#34;Girl who did cool stuff&#34; series overplays the super tough little girl angle while sticking to the overt sexually oppressive themes. It's hard to say if Stieg (RIP) was using this series to live out his fantasy's or if he was attempting to raise awareness of human trafficking and the pain that causes well beyond the actual act. I would skip it unless you're looking for a dark, very dark, after school special feeling that you better come away from this read by learning your lesson...or a lesson...or at least something.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This bingo app is fabulous. Hardly ever freezes. Customer service acts quickly to solve issues. Highly addictive though. Getting collection items is the ultimate object. Once you complete a room it's on to the next room.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS GRISHAM BOOK.  NOT UP TO HIS USUAL EXCELLENT STANDARD.  AT LEAST IN MY OPINION.  I HAVE LOVED ALL OF HIS BOOKS UP UNTIL THIS ONE.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|awesum. i loved the suspence in this video. i would recomend this to anyone. i give this a high rating. i am very pleased with it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I quite like the many levels. It stopped to beg this rating. I'm hoping forwarder a d higher levels. Good playing.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|My 11 year old luvs to play it. I've not tried, but I luv the feature to play musics as you follow the song. Pretty neat!
B000SGSU58|5.0|SO FAR I HAVE LOVED ALL HIS BOOKS AND WILL READ MORE.  HE CAPTURES MY ATTENTION AND INTEREST RIGHT OFF IN THE FIRST CHAPTER.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The great beach book - can read in about 48 hours with ease.  Characters keep you interested and story line is sweet.
B004SYP5WC|2.0|I've downloaded/bought many apps trying to find THE ONE that does what I need/want and this one looked like it could be it... so I paid $3.99 for it even tho it says for the android market and I have an IPHONE but I use my KINDLE FIRE just as much as I do my phone.  It stated that it is compatible with the Kindle so I not a problem (or so I thought).  I so would like to give this 5 stars IF some things can be changed/updated.... 1) a user manual or help section would be great.  because I can't figure out how to get it to do much of what is shown in the pictures (settings, database, etc).  2)How to sync with the computer?  3)Make it compatible with the iPhone.<br />If someone knows how to do any of these things, please reply because I really don't want to waste $4.00.  Then I can change my review/stars.<br />Thanks.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Not for me! I let go lol, it's just like the computer fb. Not for phone or tablet..  I do not recommend wasting time with this app! Keep Facebook only.. My opinion.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|It is fairly easy for me to use, though out of the majority of the time I wasn't the one using it. My sister borrowed my kindle to draw with it, and she says that it is better then anything she has drawn with before. The controls take some getting use to, and the next thing on my shopping list is deffanitly a stylas because when using my fingers it is rather hard to conect any lines. Only thing we can find wrong with it so far is the layers. There is a limit wich is rather constricting. But it is easy to merge or delete layers you are finished with. There was one issue that one of my sisters layers got deleted somehow. I am fairly certain that she had just miss clicked something and got it deleted, so nothing wrong with the program as far as I can see.
