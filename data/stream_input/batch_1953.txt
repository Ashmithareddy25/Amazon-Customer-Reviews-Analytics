B0079R8KO0|4.0|This product worked exactly as described. I am sure it will protect my new Kindle Fire for years to come.
0062200399|5.0|It's one of the greatest books by Neil Gaiman. A must read story. About the physical book, it's really beautiful in your hands and made with good material. The bold parts are raised.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Just an absolutely great and wonderful movie to watch any time of the year. The color version in the 2 disk collector's set is remarkably good.( looks as good as Blu-Ray ) I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B009X01FJS|4.0|I love the looks of this product and the way it holds my Kindle Fire HD firmly in place, not only inside but also with the extra elastic band on the outside.<br /><br />Also, I love the way I can turn the case so that I have the choice of looking at my Kindle Fire HD either horizontally or vertically.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars, except that sometimes I have trouble with the bottom portion sliding from the notches when I readjust the case to see the Kindle Fire from horizontal to vertical, or vice versa. It's not a big deal, and might just be the way I do it. I'm not sure.<br /><br />All in all, I'm quite happy with this product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game was easy to download with nice graphics and so much fun to play! Love the choice of card decor also. (-:
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Lovely British drama...costumes are amazing ..totally transport yourself back in time.  Season three just started...catch up first two seasons before diving into new one.. Enjoy!
B000SGSU58|5.0|Read this book in about two days. I could not put it down. Great plot and a great twist. Fun read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It comes in handy when driving a long way.  You even have choices on the road.<br />Easy to get to the app
B005K0HDGE|5.0|...and I am glad I did. In spite of being a preposterous story (who could expect anything else from Stephen King) it was told realistically and tenderly. I adored the fictional characters and wanted to learn more about the real people in the story. From my scanty research it seems that the author gave accurate portrayals of each one. I was in high school in 1963 and remember the events well, including watching Oswald being killed on live TV that Sunday morning while I was getting ready for church. How enlightening it is to imagine how the world might be different had none of that happened, and how everything that happens affects so much of the future. This is a book that I won't forget, unlike most of the bargain books Amazon offers.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love Dan Brown books.  His use of historical facts mixed with spys or hidden secret cultures always keeps me mesmerized until I finish the book.
B009ESIGHI|5.0|Really cute and good.  Grandchildren like it.  A cute new twist on an old story.  I also like the Muppets.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Dan Brown keeps me glued through the entire book.  His way of keepping the action in the same time frame in the different places kept me trying to find a stopping place so I could do anything else.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This is just what I was looking for and the price was better than I could find locally. Two thumbs up!
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Digital Fortress was a touch different from his other books but it still kept me stuck reading and I couldn't put it down until I was finished
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you just want to see some great films on high quality Blu-ray then this is the set for you. The films themselves are great, whether you just want to watch them for fun, or want to see examples of great cinema. While there are more expensive sets for the ultra-fan and the collector, if you're just a normal fan or you want to see the films and some extra features, then this is the best deal.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I loved the book!! It was a lot like the hunger games I would definitely read!!! It was boring in the beginning but really picked up in the middle!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this was so addictive!!! my husband and I fought about who's turn it was because we enjoyed it so much!! great game! you wont be disappointed!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I AM ANXIOUS TO GET TO THE NEXT BOOK.  I AM SURE THAT I will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. Fast read
B00AOB3FES|5.0|Amazon Instant Video is a great way to enjoy this classic. I downloaded to my daughter's kindle so she can watch on car rides.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Such an action packed adventures game totally all it friends would want to steel it kindle that's true this review is totally true best GAME EVER!!!!!#!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is great for keeping those funny videos that you must watch again and again. It's a must have.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Four albums in and Taylor Swift has gone full-on pop for her latest &#34;Red.&#34; I've enjoyed all of her CDs, but this one I am very impressed with. You will be singing the songs after just a few listens. There are plenty of hit singles here, and the tour from this album show be awesome.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|This was a hugely entertaining book that became a sadly lackluster film.  Great cast, great premise and sadly it did  not deliver!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Full of good ideas to apply to my own career.  This is a nice example of an agile business!  Hope fully I can successfully apply some of these ideas to my own career;)
0694003611|5.0|i thought this book was so boring when we first got it, and my 1 yr old wasn't attracted to the pictures.  my daughter is now 2 1/2 and she loves this book and so do i.  became one of my favorites.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|Full of good practical advice!  Wish I had purchased this when I was first starting out!  I could have saved myself a lot of headaches;)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show.  Edge of your seat riveting!  We rented seasons 1 and 2 from Netflix and could only get season 3 on Amazon at the time.  We have become Walking Dead junkies!
0399157565|5.0|I haven't start reading it yet, but I'm sure it's just as great as the others. I'm reading Red Mist on Kindle, and loving it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Nice small package.  I rarely have any need for the long thin tooth sharpener, it just takes too long to do that.  Just a reminder: the sharpness of your knives will depend more on the quality of the metal and it's ability to hold an edge, not the amount you can sharpen it to.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|and found this on on Amazon Prime:  had a lot of action (more than the current Bond film), and I really enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow..... I have never been moved to write a review for any of the over 200 books I own on my Kindle until now. I just read this book in less than 24 hours and I am still reeling.  Colleen Hoover is amazing. The Characters are so thoroughly developed and it is so easy to fall in love with them, Holder is such an amazing young man. He really helps Sky to come into her own. I would recommend this love story to anyone who likes to hear that life isnt perfect, and love can conquer all. Both Sky and Holder have experienced tragedy and have had to face demons but the fact that they have come through it and are stronger than ever is what really made this book dear to me.
B001USHRCK|3.0|Spent Christmas day putting this together as a family project.  Found it was missing some roof tiles and 2 chimney pieces at the end so was rather disappointed, especially because it was pricey!
B00821OUT6|5.0|I started with the first couple episodes and thought it was alright...but as I kept watching it, it just got better and better! Now I absolutely love it and can't wait for season 3 to start this summer!!!
B0094J2Y7A|5.0|This is Lego's first Creator house for 2013. I always recommend cross-checking with Lego for pricing and model information.<br /><br />This is probably Lego's smallest Creator-line house yet, and while it is tiny, it has a very classic look as well as small details that give it good playability. The set comes with directions for three builds, two of which are cottages, the third approximating a windmill. All three designs open up for easy access (the first has a lift-off roof and a swinging wall, the latter two are built as clamshells). There is one mini figure, and the only specialized pieces are a coffee mug and skate board. My only knock against the set is that the windmill vanes are much too short, something that I trust some kids will correct with their own spare Lego parts.<br /><br />What makes this set (and the Creator line generally) special is that it is made almost entirely with general use bricks. The chairs, stove, the side tables, the lamps, the flowers, the fence, the pond, are all done with ingenious use of common bricks. So while this is a small set, it is a fine example of small scale design. A child can learn a lot from how Lego has arranged things and how they have worked the colors (note the detail in the chimney). The selection of bricks in the set is also useful, with a good number of plates, nice blue roof tiles, windows, a yellow door and a sliding door. If the person getting this set doesn't like any of the main designs, they still have a great collection of bricks.<br /><br />I find that in play, these Creator building sets work very well. First, they are mini figure size, so kids can integrate then into many of the other Lego themes (City line, Friends...). Second, the availability of multiple directions really does encourage rebuilding. Keep those directions in a safe and accessible place so that kids can take it apart and rebuild at their whim. You may find, as I have, that your child likes to cycle through various designs.<br /><br />This is the first of three Lego Creator structures for 2013 (and the only one for the first half of the year). The forthcoming structures are the Tree House (31010) and the Family House (31012). While supplies last, Lego's 2011 [[ASIN:B004478GGK Log Cabin]] is also worth checking out.<br /><br />Cheers
B003TH2LYY|5.0|Great acting. Great writing. Great series! The instant viewing option is excellent and convenient on my Kindle Fire HD and our XBox!
1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the rare combination of science and human interest. When Henrietta Lacks dies suddenly from a raging form of cervical cancer, her family is shattered. Her cancerous cells live on outside her body and are instrumental in the discovery of the polio vaccine, among many other medical uses. An entire industry was developed from these cells, taken from her without her knowledge or permission. A heavy subject is treated with sensitivity, and even humor.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Wonderful show. I have enjoyed every episode. Sheldon is so sweet when he smiles. Penny and Leonard are great together. I love everyone on the show! Really....I do!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The book is a collection of funny events rolling into each other leading to a very amusing and entertaining book. I really enjoyed the story and the twists.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show! The actors are wonderfully funny and so cute! I have watched every season and they just can't write new shows fast enough for me. Wonderful! Thank you &#34;Big Bang&#34; cast for all the laughs!
B0040JHNZ2|5.0|This is an amazing read. The book flows so quickly and the reading is captivating. Follett doesn't disappoint ever in the book. The characters are real people who you want to hug at times, and you find yourself talking out loud at their accomplishments, their mistakes, and their sorrows.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Wonderful show. I have enjoyed every episode. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! It is a light hearted funny show, that is perfect to watch after a stressful day at work. Thank you! You guys are the best!!
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandsons love to play this game and enjoy trying to win! They enjoy being competitive so this game works well for them.
B0058BI896|5.0|Wonderful show. I have enjoyed every episode. I can't say enough great things about the show. After you get to know everyone on the show, you will fall in love with them too.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary has helped me with all my English homework. One of the best dictionary apps ever !!!! Thanks Oxford
B004O3YGMC|4.0|but it's not perfect.  still, it's the easiest to set up so far, and it works very well.  I wish that it could adjust to fit the screen of my tablet or phone, but it's only off by a little.  There are some other items too, like using an external mouse on the remote side that doesn't seem to work when the buttons are reversed.  However, I cannot say that this is due to Splashtop.  I likely need to do more research to find the source of these issues and if they can be resolved.  Bottom line: I'm happy with it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have a hard time stopping myself from playing level after level.  Only a 4 star review because the majority of the levels are pretty simple.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|For the most part, loved this book but sometimes dragged.  I would definitely recommend it.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B008MEM24S|3.0|ok,  I admit in the free version I might have been a little bit shallow with my review,  but that is only cuz I was tired and I also had bronchitis. the game is actually pretty cool ;)
0765325950|5.0|you people need to stop crushing this books rating by complaining about the lack of an ebook.  Way to drop this to 2 stars when it should be 5.  Review the book not the lack of a product on amazon.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Lower level read. There are some exciting parts that are described, but for the most part those chapters are short with little to no build-up.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love using Amazon.com on my new Kindle Fire.  I just wish you had an ap for Adobe as some programs I like require it.  Dave Lewis
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was thrilling and nonstop,I lived it from the beginning. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good book.
B005EWDA9M|4.0|The story was really great, but I felt the pace a bit slow and there were too many repetative comments.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I am a fan of Kelly Clarkson. I really like her music. As soon as I got the cd I listened to it. I really like the song Catch My Breath. I am really pleased with this purchase.
B0000032LS|5.0|I chose this rating because the cd arrived in great condition and on time.  I bought this for my mother for Christmas and it worked perfectly in her cd player.  She loves it!  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for this cd to buy it from this company because everything worked out well for them.  Thanks!
0606087230|5.0|it was interesting, heard some kids turned vegeterian, not me. it was interesting. and required reading for class. it was good.
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|I liked this book because it was funny and I liked it when he wore his pajamas under his wool sweater and the fuzzy pants. He thought that he was a person who is responsible for all the things that he did and that he was going to jail for all of that.<br /><br />  Your Friend,<br />  Grace
044654759X|5.0|christmas gift, it was good reading. my mother really enjoyed it, she has all the series. shes a teacher. good reading. i like it.
0756697875|5.0|I have not seen my 8-year old grandson David being so fascinated! He is quite a Ninjago expert and this added to his enjoyment! He went to bed later than ever before and the next morning took it to school to show his friends! He was absolutely thrilled - and so was I.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Bought the fiio e11 to juice up my ath-m50's, and this powerhouse does the trick!!<br />The fiio e11 is small put pack a serious punch!!
B00A6SZS2Q|4.0|Excellent technical performance, with a science-fiction theme reminiscent of Heinlein's \\"If This Goes On -\\" a 1940 short novel included in the 1953 compilation \\"[[ASIN:B007FVV19Q Revolt in 2100]]\\". The album became less reminiscent of the novel in the second half, but the mood is still there for me.<br /><br />The more symphonically-styled numbers reminded me in a positive way of late King Crimson, early ELO, and recent Stratovarius all at the same time. I've rated only 4 stars because parts became repetitive. My ideal remix of this project would have fewer repeated lyrics and be 5-10 minutes shorter overall.<br /><br />The sticker on the front identified \\"In The End\\" as the featured track. Personally I thought \\"In The End\\" wasn't distinctive enough. I think \\"Shadows Die\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\" are the standout tracks from this album.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Super amazing game.. I like it very much.. you should try it... its a bit hard to find invest money but you can always hy them.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fishdom is a combination of a match 3 game with the added bonus of having the fun fish tank to decorate and enjoy.  Both of those parts of this game are really cool by themselves, but when combined they make this game the perfect addition to your tablet.<br /><br />The match 3 game is very well done.  The graphics are truly stunning, the action is very smooth, and the difficulty progresses very smoothly making it challenging enough to enjoy but not so much that it gets too hard too fast.  PlayRix makes several other games we have played and PlayRix does an excellent job with their graphics, interface, and added storyline content.<br /><br />The fish tank part of this game is really clever.  My wife seems to enjoy this part as much or more than the match 3 part of the game.  She has admitted that is the reason why this is her favorite game.<br /><br />BTW, we have already upgraded to the premium/paid version of this game and it was well worth the money.
141659521X|5.0|I love every Mitch Rapp book.  If you want to follow along with the world's greatest clandestine weapon in a no-holds-barred butt kicking of terrorists, look no further.  This book will not disappoint!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|We have a lot of versions of Mahjong solitaire games and this is one of the best.  All the apps play the game about the same way and many have good graphics and play &#34;feel.&#34;  But what we like most about this particular app is the star ratings you get after each game.  That feature really makes you want to keep playing each level -- not just until you win it, but also until you get all three stars for playing it the best way in the best time.
B005NNVPOO|5.0|Although not as famous as The Wall and Dark Side of The Moon, this is still a 5-Star Album. I had not listened to it in it's entirety since the vinyl record days. It was my first Kindle HD music purchase and I enjoyed it more than I did years ago. I recommend this for anyone who appreciates great musicians and song writing. If you enjoy Pink Floyd music add this Album to your MP3 player.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Are you looking for a movie that will entertain you and make you happy?  Pitch Perfect is it - great cast (Brittany Snow is a known singing talent, but who knew Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp and Rebel Wilson could sing?), great jokes, fantastic singing and an entertaining story.  Regardless of how old you are (provided you're above, hmmmm, 13) get your friends together and have a Pitch Perfect party!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Got it fast and watched as soon as I got it. It is awesome! Cant wait for the third season to come out. Well when they finish it.
0525950079|5.0|Follett's ability to create interesting and fast moving, can't put it down fact based fiction is second to none.  Phenomenal writer.  Both World Without End and Fall of Giants are blockbusters.<br /><br />Russ Stepke<br />Naples, FL
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|interesting plot, but overly drawn out, particularly in the town in Canada where the protagonist ends up. story could have been told in 75 less pages.
0525951652|5.0|See my prior comments regarding both World Without End and Fall of Giants.  Cannot wait for Book 3 of the Century Trilogy.<br /><br />Russ Stepke<br />Naples, FL
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was insane!!! Read it or I will come after you!!!!! BUT PLEASE NOTE: PERCY JACKSON IS NOT IN THIS ONE!!!:(
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I can not tell you how much I love, love, love the West Wing!<br /><br />Got this set as a gift and didn't try the subtitles until now. They are aweful! not only are they not available in later seasons but even in the seasons with subtitles they are incorrect, crutial dialouge is missing or they become out of sync with the video.<br /><br />This should be easy to correct! Is the company not selling enough units to make it worth while?<br /><br />Discs are nicely packaged but easily fall out when the sleeve is removed from the box.<br /><br />Otherwise a great set for a great show.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is a nice, standard type escape game. Complete with a screwdriver-- gotta have a screwdriver in an escape game! If it seems too hard, try a few others and you'll get the hang of it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Besides the superb acting, the lighting and other technical aspects are outstanding.  The sweeping views of the grounds and the set lighting capture every nuance.
B00063F8B2|5.0|This movie just has great music.  Me and my boys (3 & 5) like to dance to it for fun, even when it's not Christmas.  Fun music, soft music, nostalgic music.  Has 6 new songs and 6 classics.  Love it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good graphics and an interesting storyline! well worth the time it took to download. I especially like the hidden object scenes. It is fun to use one object to help find another!
0765325950|5.0|I wanted to offset the 1 star reviews for a book that people expressly haven't read. I appreciate legitimate reviews about the content of material on amazon and I don't know why there isn't any administrative action taken when someone rates a product then specifically represents themselves as ignorant of the content of that product. I will wait for the kindle version just like I waited for Pearl Jam albums to come out on CD after releasing it on vinyl first and possibly amend my review once I read the book but considering how appreciative I am that the book was finished at all I can't imagine lowering my rating.
044651506X|5.0|\\"Plumb Island\\" was my second Neslon DeMille book and every bit as enjoyable as the first.  Wounded in the line of duty, NYPD homicide cop John Corey is convalescing in rural eastern Long Island when an attractive young couple he knows is found shot to death on the family patio.  The victims were biologists at Plum Island, a research site rumored to be an incubator for germ warfare (Plum Island is a real high security place that actually exists off of Long Island).  Suddenly, a local double murder takes on shattering global implications - and thrusts Corey and two extraordinary women into a dangerous search for the secret of PLUM ISLAND.  This book builds and builds with suspense with a very exciting climactic ending!  I really enjoyed it.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|This music CD by Mumford and Sons made a terrific holiday gift, thank you.  Mumford and sons is an excellent music group
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It does exactly what it says.  I love being able to see how much time left I have to read, listen to music, talk, use wi-fi, and how long it'll take to charge via USB or AC.<br /><br />I started with the free version and used that for about 6 weeks, then knew I had to buy Pro to support the developer.  Great app!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story is as lovely as it is heartbreaking. Great characters, unique storyline, and very well written. Not your typical teen angst - and thank goodness for that!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|GREAT book. Kept me xxx reading the entire time. I wish there was a second book to finish up there story!
B008CFN95I|4.0|I gave Mr Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore a decent 4 star rating as its a rollicking little read and surprisingly for me I really enjoyed it. Yes it finishes quite quickly, but the story as a whole, holds the reader to the main character and the supporting cast as the true meaning of this little bookstore is revealed.<br />Robin Sloan knows his Google and even if you don't, you will stilly enjoy the light hearted way the author takes the Micky out of us modern techies....
B001JIES4Q|5.0|I watch this movie every year at Christmas.  It's very heart warming and funny.  Hugh Grant is charming and hilarious.  I also love the scenes with Mr. Bean!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I recommend this game.  I enjoyed it even more in the higher levels.  Very addicting.  You won't want to put it down.
B001NHNG64|5.0|A great easy read full of action and suspense. My first time reading a Jack Reacher book by Child. Excellent!
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer's finest work, in my view, were his books 'Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less' and 'Kane & Abel' both published in the 70's. The Clifton Chronicles series are in this league. 'The Sins of the Father', is a sequel to 'Only Time Will Tell' and starts in the 1930's and traces the parallel path of characters that are on collision courses. Wonderfully written with real historic insights,this book leaves you like the first, wanting more. The stage is set for another in the series and I for one will be pre-ordering it!
1250006341|5.0|Got this as a gift for my daughter who loves Downtown Abbey. She was so excited receiving it. Thank you
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|Was kinda skeptical about this purchase. But the kids love it. Its easy to set up and fun to play.
B009NPK1IO|4.0|I love GG, so disappointed the show is over. The only reason I gave 4 stars is it's only 10 episodes!
1419705849|4.0|My son loves the Wimpy kid series. He read this book in one day. Can't wait for the next one to come out now..
B0052U59F4|1.0|I know these books have gotten a lot of publicity, but maybe that's what is wrong with the world.<br />I found them boring and predictable, and I could care less what they do with their sex life, I am living my own and don't need to share.
B0096HFOZO|4.0|Best book ever!  But gross. I liked this book a lot.I couldn't  stop reading it.Really!!!!!!!!!!!:0 It is very very very very very gross!duuuuuuuuuude.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved each and every book in this series.  Buy it and see for yourself!<br />You won't be able to put them down.
B007PFD90G|3.0|It's the kind of book that lulls you along.  It's not hard to follow and, as always, the Rushdie gift at making you laugh at serious events in the protagonist's life.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Its hard to see with my eyes. The blocks are small and need to be alittle larger for those of us who have problems with our eyes. My kids like to play with it so its ok.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|DOWNLOAD THIS CAUSE OF MY KIDS ALWAYS COMPETING WITH ME.<br />LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT...<br />PLAY ALL DAY<br />I WISH I COULD PLAY THIS WHEN I AM WORK
0307272702|5.0|Taubes has done an excellent job of nutshelling the journalistic research he has done on this subject. GPs especially should be reading this concise but thorough introduction into the science behind fat deposition and insulin resistance. I was doubtful myself, after 20 years of morbid obesity and trying every diet, numerous gyms and exercise plans, nothing has worked. Especially not the constant reminders from my GPs to \\"just eat less and exercise more\\", which would just leave me hungry and exhausted. This isn't a diet book, but I chose to plan my eating around the science that he discusses in the book, to amazing results. I've lost three stone and dropped three dress sizes in the past 6 months, I'm full of energy for the first time in ages, and my fibromyalgia symptoms have disappeared. The lipid hypothesis is bunk, read the good science behind why a high-fat low-carb diet is healthy for you, asap!
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. I like HAPPY endings better so I rated 4. I other words, this book was the great.
0061900656|4.0|This book is great for preparing an older brother to welcome a new baby. It explains all the things a new baby can and cannot do so that the older child does not have unrealistic expectations.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Took me a few chapters to get my mind into this book but kept my interest until the end. Good mystery
0375842209|5.0|I had this book sitting down my book shelf for 2 years or so. I finally grabbed it, and WOW! What an amazing book! Read it you won't regret it. It was a page-turner for me. Love love love it!
B009JBZH54|4.0|I got this for Christmas from my wife. This was my first Blu-ray experience and I was amazed. The picture and sound are amazing. There are hours of special features. I especially liked the Batmobile documentary on The Dark Knight Rises Special Features blu-ray. In Nolan tradition, there were no deleted scenes for any of the three movies. I love these three movies. As a fan of Batman my entire life, I feel The Dark Knight Trilogy is a nearly flawless adaptation of Batman. I am very happy with how Nolan portrayed Batman.
B00170MYIS|5.0|I bought this as an extra battery for my new digital camera one year ago. It has been excellent. It holds a great charge, no issues. Would buy it again.

His letter includes full descriptions of &#34;the two Indias&#34; and how he has grown from a boyhood in the Darkness to an entrepreneur in the Light.  He divulges all of his secrets.  Hit and run accidents, blackmail, prostitution, politics, religion, and every other situation that so clearly divides a society.<br /><br />Balram is born into a famiy so large that he is not even given a name.  He is simply called Munna (boy) by his family.  He is given the name &#34;The White Tiger&#34; by a government official that visits his school after he is quizzed and is smarter than all of his classmates. He is told that a white tiger is a magical animal that comes around once in a generation.<br /><br />Balram's stories of Darkness and Light as well as his master/ slave relationships are fluid and  relative to where his is and where he is going.  He tells of an India that is full of lies and blackmail at every level.  That no one is on the straight and narrow.<br /><br />At the end of the novel, when his letter is complete, his original blessing has become a curse.  A White Tiger keeps no friends.
B005779X4U|5.0|I needed to clean up the look of my trash area in the kitchen since it's adjacent to our main living area and this receptacle was just what I needed.  I love that I can consolidate my recycling and trash into one unit.  Since I have only a 2 person household, we don't generate a lot of trash, so we're using the larger container (black side) for the recycling and smaller container (blue side) for the trash.  Not planning to buy the specialty Simplehuman bags, a standard small trash bag fits fine for our purposes.
0062101897|5.0|Got this for my 13 year old daughter who is a BIG Harry Potter fan. Really nice book but it is really BIG! Hard to find a place on her small bookcase to keep it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I had pretty high expectations for this book, however it just wasn't what I was looking for. Good book, just not one I would recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband and kids love this game. They have it on the IPAD as well as several of their phones.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I have not read any P.G. Wodehouse novels/stories yet, but I can safely say that this series is superb by itself. Hugh Laurie is great as the pleasant but flawed and bumbling Bertie Wooster and Stephen Fry is downright genius as Jeeves. Both use facial expressions with as much tact and timing as the spoken words (you'll soon grow fond of Bertie's hopelessly clueless \\"bug eyes\\" and Jeeves' silent expressions that say a million things). The supporting cast is also very excellent - pay particular attention to Brenda Bruce as the brazenly fussy but hearty Aunt Dahlia and John Turner as the quick-tempered (and absurdly proto-Hitler) Roderick Spode, who is hilarious in every single scene they squeezed him into.<br /><br />Interesting point to quickly mention here: I believe these show would qualify as family-friendly viewing (assuming your family has the attention span for this brand of humor...my 5-year-old niece just liked Hugh Laurie banging away on the piano!). There is occasional comical swearing, but no violence for the sake of violence, nudity or sexuality (and so there shouldn't be since these stories were originally meant to be just that: entertaining stories!). Those who were turned off by Stephen Fry's extroverted, leave-nothing-to-the-imagination portrayal of Oscar Wilde several years ago will find this show pleasantly clean and Fry's acting turn here subtle and gentle.<br /><br />There is a good mixture here of satire, political humor, physical comedy, farce, and just general silliness. Each element is in equal balance, so it won't ever feel like you're just watching a \\"Three Stooges\\" marathon. The costumes, sets, and scenery are all gorgeous and meticulous. Architecture fans will have a lot to peruse since episodes are frequently set inside lovely old manors or castles. I personally enjoy a good historical fiction for the visuals but dislike idle melodrama, so this series is a natural fit. Some reviewers here don't like the music and think it is repetitive.I don't argue with the repetition claim, but I think it suits the nature of the series. A fun bonus of this show is Hugh Laurie's frequent on-camera piano playing and singing, generally of very silly songs of the 1920s-1930s. Laurie has been noted for his musical ability before, but it looks like he was genuinely enjoying himself here.<br /><br />As to the accuracy to Wodehouse's novels, I cannot vouch for them. I have been told that many of the original stories were altered or combined and certain details changed or left out in this series. Unless you're a strict purist, I wouldn't worry too much about all that. The fact is that these have a good spirit about them and they are strong enough as their own separate entities rather than supplemental \\"visual aids\\" to the written stories. Every episode is entertaining in some way and stands up to multiple viewings (great for aimless weekends, as stress relievers, or just a way to unwind). Those of you who know a bit about early 20th-century history and culture will find that knowledge helpful in appreciating the humor, but you don't absolutely have to be a history buff to enjoy it.<br /><br />I do not have this specific DVD set, but I will say that the DVD versions I've seen out there are not that much better quality than the VHS version. If you have a VCR and do not have this set on DVD yet, you may want to pick up gently-used tape versions first if it's cheaper.<br /><br />This show is both refreshing and heartwarming. It's true that these would be more helpful if they had subtitles, but since I watch a fair amount of British TV, the accents don't bother me personally most of the time (want a REALLY cryptic show? Try \\"Killinaskully\\"!!).
B005HSL626|5.0|Super addictive game. We have it on several phones as well as a couple of IPADS. Fun for adults and kids.
0765325950|1.0|Ebook please you only get one star and not one more before you we can read it on the kindel reader.<br />best regards Potnudel
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just like all Sparks' books, this one does not disappoint!  I love the fact that there was action and suspense in this one!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am never disappointed in a Jodi Picoult book.She always deals in a quandary I can feel and be glad not to be forced to deal with in reality.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|From my 3.5 year old to my 40+ year old husband, we all get caught up in the fun of slinging a bird at pigs dressed up as storm troopers.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Thought this movie would be another low production stupid movie, but to my surprise, I love it! It's my &#34;go to&#34; movie when I need a good laugh, or just something to watch that I don't have to think about. Emma Stone is an incredible actress, in my opinion, and she is GREAT in this movie.
B006O3MU96|1.0|way way funf for about a half of a nano second then just weak and then just w. the f. is this
B002ZG976U|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I love Cher and the way she portrays her character. Overall, a pretty good movie that I have watched several times since getting it. Packaging was great, as it came with 2 other DVD's I ordered, all of them plastic sealed to a cardboard sheet inside the shipping box, which provided perfect protection.....all DVD's should be shipped this way!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It is rare for a YA to take me by surprise, but the twist did.<br />The novel contains some pretty heavy themes, namely molestation/abuse which I feel was handled fairly sensitively.<br />There was some pretty good UST between the protagonist and her love interest. I really enjoyed her friend Six as well. Some great snappy dialogue.<br />A very engaging read and a fantastic ending that really gave this reader a sense of deep satisfaction.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I was leary about getting this movie, but I absolutely LOVE how they kept it so close to the original. What I really liked is how they changed Uncle Wes to be more laid back, giving the little girls much more acting in the movie, and most of all how they brought Vi into a more outgoing woman, rather than seeing her (in the original) just sit back and keep her mouth shut. Overall, I absolutely love this movie, but still watch the original now and then too. And the soundtrack to this updated version is absolutely fantastic!!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Quirky; weird at the beginning then gets funnier from there.  Wish more movies like this were made.  Must rent not own.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This feels more like a way to trick kids into spending real money to buy fake stuff for fake pets.
0765325950|5.0|I am one who started this series in the 90's when I was in high school and faithfully stuck with it book by book eagerly anticipating this final volume. As such, I must say that it really kills me to have to open up Amazon at 6am on the day of release, only to find the book with an appalling 2 star avg review, due to the antics of too many silly whining bixch's here on Amazon who are apparently pissed about the lack of an ebook release on day one.<br /><br />Amazingly, some even claim to have been reading these books since 1984, which is about 6 years before the release of The Eye of the World, the first book in the series.  This I guess should at least say something about the intelligence level of these worms, who are willing to come onto these boards and smear this noble effort simply because it wasn't released in the format of their choosing on day one.<br /><br />For Criminy's sake!  First of all, be grateful that this book was released at all.  Second of all, know that the book will be released in ebook format 3 months from now.  If that is your preferred method of reading, then feel free to wait another 3 months to give it a read.  If you are truly one who has waited since 1984 to read this last volume, than like me, you should probably feel at least a little bit nostalgic about buying the hard cover release on day one (as it should be a repeat experience) and cradling the thick, lovely, volume as you make your way home to enjoy it.<br /><br />All I am saying, is that I am really appalled at all the spoiled, whining half wits who decided to come online this morning and give this book a 1 star review, not on the merit of the content, but simply because they were pissed that they could not download it to their kindle like they felt their entitled ass's deserved.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good easy read action packed . Can't wait to see what happens next in the next two books with catniss
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My brother and sister-in-law were impressed with the cuteness of the doll and commented on how it smelled good with the vanilla scent. It was a perfect size for our almost 1 year old niece.
1118273052|5.0|I've learned that successful trading is about perspective. This book delivers that in droves. It's the closest many of us independents will ever get to learning from the masters. So unless you work for a hedge fund or goldman sachs, you simply must read this book to understand both how to operate in the markets and how your competition operates. It's a must for everyone that ever places a trade.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Awesome movie for kids and adults. Really nice pictures and watched a few of the special features that were interesting.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|Great Action, Any Easy 4 starts almost 5.  I when into this thinking it would be very cheezzy, but not so much.<br />Good acting, good plot, just an over all action packed, american movie.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|This movie kept us on the edge of our seats.  Well acted and we will watch this again and again!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I struggle to find series that really interest me, this is one! I an only halfway through Season 1 and I'm keen to see where the plot goes. Hope it stays as interesting as it is now...
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My granddaughters love Taylor's music. Singing and dancing all day :) Precious.  Music appropriate for young girls is hard to find.  I really appreciate that Taylor remembers that young ladies look up to her.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Over all its a great album and the songs are catchy wand have great meaning so its basically GREAT :)
0802473156|5.0|I haven't had time to read this one yet, but it arrived in good time and in the condition advertised. I'm well pleased with it! Pam
0425263908|1.0|I work for a company that converts books into accessible formats, so reading this book was merely part of my job. I had to transcribe FSoG a few months ago, and when I finished I was completely dumbfounded as to its popularity. Badly written pulp bilge, with the worst characters I have ever encountered in print.<br /><br />Ahem. Fast forward a few months, and this book lands on my desk. My heart sinks. The cover states: 'If you Liked Fifty Shades of Grey, then you'll love this.\\"<br /><br />We're already onto a loser here.<br /><br />After having read it, the only thumbs up it that the prose style ISN'T as galactically terrible as FSoG. But apart from that, same plot. Sylvia Day used the 'Find and Replace' tool to substitute Ana for whats-her-name, and Christian for Gideon. YAWN.<br /><br />At least I was paid to read it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't understand all the hype and how its been on the top 10 for weeks. This book started off incredibly slow and then it barely got exciting towards the end but by that time i was over it! Besides the fact that I spent 13 dollars on it!! Save yourself some time and money and don't read this! Ive spent 99 cents on books that were way better!!!!
B000SEJHRA|4.0|If you like David Sedaris, you'll like this book. If you're reading him for the first time, you'll be alternately amused, shocked, in complete agreement and in total opposition to what he puts on the page. Not for the conservative-minded reader!  It's dark comedy, and you may leave laughing with a heavy heart.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sexy has a new name and its Gideon Cross!!!!! Move over Christian Grey there is a new hottie in town and he's blowing you away!!!!
B005OZE9SA|4.0|My only gripe is that once in a while after it's been on for a long time it seems to drop out / stop working in windows 7. I've tinkered with my usb power-save settings, etc, and it still seems to be an issue. Not that big of a deal as it doesn't do it when actively being used, but about once every other day I have to unplug the USB and reconnect it. Could be my system, could be the pre-amp, otherwise no complaints.<br /><br />Though be wise and download your drivers from the website, not the included software. I don't even know what is on the software but I think it's a full version behind what you'll find on the website.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|They're no words for this incredible book!! I was hooked during the first chapter. This is such a well written book with tons of surprises!!! GREAT READ!!!!!!!!!
B009SQQRH2|4.0|I am usually leery of &#34;kids&#34; movies as most contain material not suitable for the 6 and under set.  Very little in this movie concerned me. There was one uneccessary but quick blip with a crazy guy and a rifle.  The images and graphics were really detailed and just plain amazing.  All in all a great family holiday movie with a nice message about family redemption.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose this rating because the first book, although good, gave little insight to character behavior.. the second book little more real and convincing. Again well written and looking forward to the third book
B000002TLX|5.0|From Richards earier years a pick of his bigest hits. Personally love every song on the CD. This is a keeper CD
B000VHMF0A|5.0|an album full of his best songs. a must for people that enjoy and listen to Bob at his best.
B00000633U|5.0|Richard let his hair down here, or should I say his mullet. Which he doesn't like to be reminded about. But he's cool with it. He has that quirky sense of humor that I love.
B00A0T0NWQ|4.0|This movie was so funny but had a friend watch it with me that has seen it before and one part of the movie was not in it so that is why i gave it a 4 star.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Another true story which my husband and I regard as one of our Top 2 movies.  The story is true and bitter sweet; however, this has scenes that are the funniest ones I have seen in a Christian movie.  Very true to life and a moving tribute to Godly fathers everywhere.  Our church was so moved by the contents of this movie that we had our own Courageous ceremony, and many of our husbands and fathers stood up to the challenge made in this movie.  Again, the actors were top-notch and their portrayal of the characters involved were very moving. A copy of this movie should be in every family's library!
B001JRB16U|5.0|I love anything with Julie Andrews in it.  I bought this particular dvd for a young wome\an who has celebal palsey for she is almost completly an invalid, she loves Julie Andrews so much she wants to watch everyone of Julie's musical movies.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I love autobiographies and movies derived from true stories.  Bethany Hamilton and her family were heavily involved in the making of Soul Surfer, and the all-star cast truly did justice in telling this story.  In fact, this movie stood as one of the longest running movie at our local $ movie theater in Tulsa, OK.<br /><br />The story is poignant and the scenery (especially the ocean shots) was breathtaking.  You won't be sorry in buying this movie!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|IT IS  THE  BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!!!!I LOVE HOW IT IS AMAZINGLY DETAILED!!!!!I WAS REALLY BUMMED OUT THAT PERCY WAS GONE FROM THIS BOOK:(
B0053O89XI|5.0|Great show and great combo pack. Trying to phase out of DVD's so the fact that this came with the Blu-ray for only a little bit more was the selling point for me.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Crashes in online player battles all the time. Won't load half of my allies bases. Still has a few bugs, but still a wonderful waste of time. Kindle Fire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome the action and the little bit of romance. These are the kind of books I love. The science fiction type of books. I can't wait too read catching fire. This book is a book and I suggest you should read it if you haven't already it'd just the action in this book is amazing  I loved it!!!!!:):):)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Once I start playing it is hard for me to quit.  I keep waiting for my coins to build up so I can play again.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This game reminds me of childhood games, when Atari was fading out and games with almost decent graphics stepped in.  For a simple app this game is loads of fun.  I would've given it 5 stars, but it would require the game to be a little more feature packed for that final star (like nitrous boosts, smokescreens, fun stuff like that).
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am a 16 year old male in 11th grade, and I not only found \\"Perks\\" to be very entertaining, but incredibly relatable. As a high school student, his problems and his experiences seemed very real, and I often found myself being able to connect with many of the characters. Overall, it was an awesome read, and I learned to appreciate some of the hidden wonders of life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just the way I like these kinds of things.  It's a calculator when I need it and not a confusing scientific machine.  It works perfectly and my daughters love playing with their numbers on it!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|One of the best series I've ever read!! On the edge of my seat throughout the entire book!! A must read if you've read the other two!!!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Toys movie get 2 stars for 2 A list stars. Movie sucked huevos if you know what that means.  Slow and slower and slowly bored you but not too death
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it, would recommend this book to the romance readers any day. Might read it again. We shall see. Lol
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Somehow I'd never read this book before-only seen the movie-but it's truly an excellent book, well written,many life lessons still applicable today. Great read for boys/men and girls/women.
B008VBYN80|1.0|I loved Oregon Settler, still play it. I tried FantasyTown and I ended up having the same issue with K&L as I did with FT.  There is no way to play this game without spending money or &#34;friending&#34; people and performing tasks. I just want a fun, slightly addictive game that I can play anywhere (that isn't solitaire, scrable, etc).  FantasyTown was much more annoying in terms of making you buy things but K&L is a close second.  When I'm looking for new games, I now actively avoid GameLoft.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Absolutely love it!!!! I love Criminal Minds!!! Arrived in a timely manner and have already watched all the episodes for this season. Can't wait for the next one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I saw a brief mention of Me Before You and decided to buy it. After I started the book, I read the review in the NY Times. I am not sure I would have read it had I known the story. But, I am so glad I did. Although it's presented as a romance, it's so much more. Jojo Moyes skillfully and sensitively handles a difficult and controversial subject. Her main characters, Will and Louisa, are complex, and I wasn't very far into the story before I felt as if I personally knew them. Both are likable, self-absorbed, and believable. Various characters narrate throughout, and never once did I stop to look at sentence structure or have to go back and reread a passage. Moyes' writing is flawless and flows beautifully. This book is very moving and thought provoking; it's full of life and humor. I'll admit I wept a bit at the end. And yet, I found the ending oddly uplifting. The only negative thing I can say about Me Before You is that it ended. Highly recommended.
0765325950|1.0|Love the series, and have been looking forward to this one for a very long time.  I'm extremely disappointed in the four month delay for the ebook.  I'll change my review when the publisher gets with the times.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great book that draws you deeper as you read each chapter. I've read much science fiction over the years and this one is a very memorable one. It takes place in the distant future in a post Apocalypse world where men live inside in the ground. They don't know how they got there or where their future lies. It's a book that is hard to put down.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love the series!  DVD's arrived quickly.  All intact.  Liked the way things were packaged.  Will purchase next season when available.
1607066017|5.0|A fun exceedingly well done adventure through science fiction and.. hell, whatever.  This is a great comic and you'd be well served to give it a try.  Best of 2012.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It's quick to get started with, but there are a lot of professional tools to try that sharpen pics, add borders, skew images, even add text and call-outs and other silly things to your pics. Easily upload to Facebook and Twitter and other sites. Apps like this for Kindle can cost $$$, and are complicated.<br /><br />You can also draw and do many, many, other effects...I haven't even scratched the surface of the things this app does. But it is user friendly, easily learned, laid out for non-pros like me - although pros will find it very useful -and just plain fun. It's good for sharing photos with just minor touch-ups...but it's too hard to resist playing around.<br /><br />Lol...be one of those people that post hilarious stuff on Facebook!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Easy to read and great characters. I cant wait until Walking Disaster comes out.  There isnt really a cliff hanger I just want more :-)
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I watched this with some initial skepticism. In retrospect, that was perhaps the best approach, because by the end of it, I was as caught up in the magic as were the young, nameless adventurers on the train.<br /><br />The animation itself is quite captivating, and adults should watch for cameos - one or two of them hilarious. Action sequences are breathtaking and there is no violence to worry about. Tension in the story comes from anything that might be important to a child - loss of \\"magical\\" Christmas feelings, worries about getting into trouble, and the thrill of an independent adventure.<br /><br />I don't have young kids, but I did wonder if a couple of the scenes might be too spooky or intense for very small children. It might be worth a preview if your little children have active bedtime imaginations, but then, I may be too cautious.<br /><br />As for adult viewers, this is a rocket ride back to childhood, with plenty to keep you entertained in grown-up asides. There is nothing saccharin about it, and if you have any trace of holiday spirit left over from your early years, you'll be swept up in the draft of the Polar Express.<br /><br />Enjoy your trip!
B000S398WU|4.0|Legends of Jazz is a good sampling of a variety of jazz artists, most of them past their prime. For example, Dave Brubeck died just a few days ago. But if you have a blu-ray player, the blu-ray version is about the same price as the DVD and looks great.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I enjoyed the songs, and of course the upgrades the songs and the sounds . Good classic album to be enjoy and relax the time away.
1848313470|5.0|You might remember the mapping of the human genome that was completed in 2000. The scientists who sequenced it were disappointed that there were so few genes, about the same as the number of genes in the mouse genome. Epigenetics means beyond genes. It is the science of how genes are expressed or turned off.<br />Nessa Carey provides a comprehensive view of this revolution, which includes identical twins, Tortoiseshell cats and the battle of the sexes. This book is a good starting point for learning about epigenetics, the best I have found so far. I recommend it highly.
B008220AVW|5.0|My daughter had been looking for this movie for a little while in the stores, she was excited I had ordered it for her for Christmas.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|There are classic tunes, classic costumes and a classic story, if you haven't seen this, then you haven't seen Garland at her very best.<br /><br />This has been remastered and looks fantastic on blu ray, sounds fantastic and has a wealth of special features that any fan would love.
0062213423|5.0|My daughter is in love with this band. The book was so perfect for christmas for her! She wants to know all about them!
B008AT71WI|5.0|You know the movie, you have the soundtrack, you might have even sung the songs.  Now see it in full remastered glory as this has never sounded or looked better than before.  Now includes the infamous original ending that test audiences didn't like at all and a wealth of special features that any fan will love.  Not only an 80s classic, but a must buy for serious collectors.
0316228532|4.0|Great book, very different from her usual writing (Harry Potter) However, she really brakes out the mold and I was particularly impressed about her ability to relate to a wide range of characters. I was worried anything but teenage boys would get the wayside here, but she writes middle age fussy British women as well as abandoned poor slum daughters equally well.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This was a great movie and totally unexpected pleasure. The subject matter was interesting and the actors were great to watch.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The movie &#34;Looper&#34; has a weak but but interesting premise.  One man meeting himself in the past and must kill his older self is worth about 30 minutes of my time.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer isn't exactly up to Grisham's standards.  He admits somewhere that he &#34;just wrote it&#34; and that it isn't well researched.  That shows, especially to discerning readers.  Outside of that, it IS a pretty good story, although much less of a finesse than most of his work.  Except for the many obvious failures of fact, it's a reasonably good read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Truly great app I love this  app it keeps me awake and wakes me up. I recommend this app to anyone who is looking for an alarm clock app.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Great Movie, Why did I not hear about this movie when it was in the theaters. I am only penning a review so that I can perhaps get one more person to see this film.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a really fun read, with a lot of interesting manipulation of laws domestic and foreign.  Pretty much total fantasy but entertaining.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This entire production is perfect.  Sometimes one comes across music that is never tiring.  Such is the achievement here from Florence + The Machine!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I own a very nice collection of Henckels kitchen knives, all of which I meticulously maintain by regularly honing and sharpening. However, a steel and sharpening stone can't be used on my serrated knives, all of which were starting to not cut as they once did.<br /><br />This little tool not only got them sharp, but I swear that they are even sharper than when I first bought them! (Note that I'm only using the tapered diamond rod and not the built-in ceramic and carbide sharpeners).
B003Y5H556|3.0|Pretty Predictable. Build up to the ending was<br /> pretty slow. Amanda Seyfried makes the perfect Red.  The acting wad lame for the other actors.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game! But watch out for addictive behavior, I think my wife may need some professional help. She has ran the battery down more than once on the Kindle.
B007HO392S|5.0|carrie is one oo the best american idols.  she is beautiful, smart, and a super musician.  congrats to her on this album
B0058EBNAO|5.0|A wonderful app that does everything it says it will do. It's beautiful on my Kindle Fire HD and runs perfectly every time. I really depend on this when tornadoes are predicted. I won't go into all the details about it as others have done that job perfectly..I have not had a moment's problem with this app. I love it.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|This one of my all time favorite Christmas movies, so I was excited to see it offered on Blu-ray.  The price was good and the product arrived within the specified time.  Would recommend.
B00005JNS0|5.0|All of the actors fit perfectly for these roles, It was so great to see a great animation of these funny actors
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie!  It is the last movie I watch on Christmas Eve every year, so I am thrilled to have on Blu-Ray.  The quality is excellent and the price was reasonable.  Would highly recommend.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever, don't we always want to know that I our lives are just not going as planned and yet, when fate comes in to play it's never better than what comes from it, would we change anything from George's life?
B00AHCF9E8|5.0|Got all three of their new release, and this one is the best.  With the previous two albums, there were a few songs that I didn't like, but there isn't a bad track in this album.  I would play this on shuffle over and over.
B00005JM02|5.0|Well, you just  have to wonder when they are going to do another movie with the same actors everyone fit their parts perfectly! I love watching this over and over.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was awesome because the book has a lot and it was the first dairy of a wimpy kid book.
B004J64QSI|5.0|What a treat to see and hear the people who have starred in this fabulous show over the past 25 years!  A beautiful celebration that honors this musical and really touches the heartstrings.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love going there to read what people have to say. It would be better if my Kindle didn't freeze so much.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love all the options that picarts offers.especially the  custom face book collage ! I am anxious to experiment with the additional features ,more photo fun to come for me!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it!! Its Great! I use it everyday with my kindle fire! It lets you know how long it will take it to charge and lets you know how long you have on wiring and on 2d and 3d games! Very Cool app! I would recommend this to everyone!
B007T99ENE|4.0|Not his best work, but a strong storyline constructed with the skill you'd expect from Mr. McEwan. A good solidly entertaining read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the first game I go to when I open my kindle. I could sit and play for hours, but then my grand kids come and play on my kindle .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Both my husband and I have this on our android devices and it definetly is addictive.  We compete with each other.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the game spider. I think it is way better that solitaire because you can maneuver the cards in a way you can't when playing solitaire.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have to be honest and say I'm right in the middle of this book and can't seem to find enough time to read it but it's been chosen for my book club. I really appreciate the detail, the mystery and drama Morgenstern paints without it being too much.<br />Can't wait to finish it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I was worried when I first started reading the book because my friend told me that it was slow paced. the courtship between two people was different back then than it is today so you have to be prepared for it. other than that small detail I completely loved the book. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are a great couple. I enjoyed it so much I read it again. if you are the kind of person to wonder how dating or romance happened then read this book; you will absolutely love the chemistry between the two.
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|I for years had heard those who loved this series so I checked it out.  I really enjoyed the first three seasons and would have rated them 5 star.  The last two were good, but not fantastic.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a wonderful book with deep human (errr, I mean dog...) emotion.  Relatable life lessons and poignant meanings along the way.  A very quick read that I would recommend to everyone.
1582701709|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. It will take anyone far in life that believes it works. Was in great condition.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Movie was ok. Had some funny parts, but was a little boring. My husband enjoyed much more then I did.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I absolutely love American Horror Story. It is one of the best shows on television. The product was also in great condition.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I choose this movie being a fan of the old Total Recall. Although it wasn't as good as the first one, I still really enjoyed.
6302797586|5.0|My husband never saw the series, so I bought this for him.  He was very moved with the story line.
B00846REIS|5.0|Such a great story. I couldn't put it down. Love the characters...shoot just everything about it. Definitely one of my top 5
B007HO392S|4.0|I enjoyed her album, but I was not famiilar with many of the songs.  Some were hard to understand what she was saying.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Totally loved it! What a great story and characters. Not one of my kind of reads but so glad it was suggested to me.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I'm not a teen so I listen less.  I am not sick of hearing &#34;We will never, never, get back together&#34;.  There are many good songs on this album.
B007SGM084|5.0|Thanks for sharing this book. Never thought I'd read a book like this. But I loved it, what a great story.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Best show on TV! The writing is fantastic, always keeps you on your toes! You can not tell what is going to happen next!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked this better then 50 shades. That book was great to. But just loved this story. Can't wait for the third book.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|As a student of Roman History, I was amazed to see the reality of this series.  Although the death of the leading actor has put a stop to the filming, I am hoping this series will continue.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was an interesting dystopia novel.  I was looking forward to reading it every day, but was very disappointed in the sudden ending.  It's almost as if the writer got tired.
B002Z5FM74|5.0|Got this gift for my father and he really liked it. It was cheap, came relatively quick, and works great.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Not as good as the first part of the Trilogy and the characters are a little confusing in who is who and the relationships get a little lost, but a good read as all Ken Follett's books, I am a real fan of his.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|A fantastic book.  A real page turner.  Sex, intrigue, adventure, Heroes and Heroins.  Get It!  You won't be regret it....
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great music and a funny story line that puts two entertainers at odds over the same women.  I typically pull this movie out around Christmas time, but its a great movie for any time of the year!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game was so fun. my son's and I very much enjoyed playing this game.we were on the edge of our seats the whole time.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Love the price we were able to get this great movie for.  Kids love it and the adults love it too.
B004NJW96M|5.0|Flat, quiet pressing, 2 lp, the cd was a little harsh in the DR department, the vinyl press makes this excellent album listenable, while not an audiophile level recording it beats the cd hands down, a beautiful set comes with a large poster of the cover plus a cd, for 15 bucks it's a steal
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Must watch!  Love the Bourne movies and this is no exception!  Even better when you have a good looking bunch of cast members!
B0059XTTW8|2.0|For a far superior experience of this story, read the book and watch the 6 hour, three-part, BBC mini-series. Both the movie and TV production have great actors, but the acting in the BBC series is superior (Alec Guinness, Ian Richardson, etc.) and, being three times longer in length,  the series has time to draw the complicated story out more successfully. Even then, the brilliantly acted and filmed mini-series is complicated and is better understood and appreciated if one watches it a couple of times after reading the book.<br /><br />I don't believe someone who has no familiarity with the story can watch this 2 hour movie without being confused about the plot. For me, having read the book and seen the BBC version two or three times, the movie was rather disappointing.<br /><br /> Partly because of the problem of the story being too condensed, the viewer has to be able to pick up details in the plot very quickly, and remember them well, or he/she will be completely lost. This relates, in part, to a number of flashbacks that could be very confusing.<br /><br />I also thought some of the changes made in the plot for the movie (apparently to save time) were less plausible than the BBC and book versions. For example, in the movie, government official Oliver Lacon appears to launch an investigation of British Intelligence solely based on a phone call from a stranger named Ricki Tarr who tells him he works under agent Peter Guillam and that \\"The Circus\\" (British Intelligence, MI5) has a mole. Without even checking with Guillam (who, by the way, would have denounced Tarr as a traitor unless he could be convinced otherwise), Lacon calls George Smiley in and initiates an unofficial investigation. At least the BBC has Lacon, Guillam and Smiley talk things through with Tarr before Smiley is asked to find the mole. And threatening to fly Toby Esterhase back to Europe and drop him off (apparently to face arrest due to outstanding warrants) in order to get him to cooperate with Smiley and reveal the address of the safe house seemed a bit much to me.<br /><br />Included with the DVD version of the movie is a bonus feature of scenes that were cut. These are not worth watching and I am surprised they were added to the DVD. For example, what is the point of watching George Smiley cook an egg for three minutes?<br /><br />In short, skip this film and watch the BBC version.Smiley and reveal the address of the safe house seemed a bit much to me.<br /><br />Included with the DVD version of the movie is a bonus feature of scenes that were cut.

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I liked him on American Idol, glad he won, wouldn't have ordered if I didn't like him - seems silly to ask me if I liked it
B00005UW7V|5.0|Being a mom, this movie was very emotional for me. Haley-Joel Osment, as a robot boy, goes through many challenging events in trying to become a &#34;real boy&#34;, so his mommy will love him. The ending is so heart-wrenching that I was not able to watch it the first time. I will be watching it again, many times!
0385535147|5.0|have read all of his - this was a tougher read than most and I can't really explain why but you should read it
0425263916|5.0|Great book and nice follow up to book one! A good love story with plenty of angst in between. I can't wait for the third installation.
0385344333|5.0|this author is wonderful - have read everyone of his - not sure i would have picked Tom Cruise as the movie star though
B007885IJU|5.0|Granddaughter Loved this and was dancing happy about it so you are heros there I have no Idea who they are but i try to please here cause I love her!
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is my favorite TV show - makes me laugh - everyone should watch it - even love the reruns
B008B9JSKU|5.0|The Samaritan,<br />Great Movie!! Love Samuel L Always bring the action. The price was good also. Can't wait for his next movie.
0812993292|5.0|a book that makes you take inventory of yourself and makes you think - in addition to being a quick read
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was very happy when I used my backpack to transport my equipment, I don't own many sets of lenses or filters, but far from the basic stuff and it is perfect for me and I still have a lot of place to expend my collection.<br />Still have some features to test, but for what I used until now it is perfect for someone who loves photography and needs to carry a set of equipment around.
1401322786|5.0|a favorite author - makes you think - a very quick read - you will enjoy but not quite as much as his other books
B00A8ECU24|5.0|well it makes our little one happy so in a way Im enjoying it too. great app given its free and makes the babies happy
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Bruce Willis couldn't even save this craptastic movie. Too many things happening, time travel, telekinesis powers, hit men, the mafia, The future and the future..future you, and a hot chick on a farm???? I don't think so...and Joseph Gordon Levitt looks nothing like bruce Willis.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! Would recommend purchasing versus renting because this is one that you have to watch multiple times to catch everything. Enjoying my Amazon Prime with the Kindle Fire and considering keeping it after my free month is over.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|A very enjoyable movie and the stop-motion animation is incredible! We're rather disappointed we didn't see it in the theatres!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app!!  It allows you to pick more than one location to save as a favorite so you can see the weather at your current location and any others you want to monitor. For example, future travel locations, or where friends or family live. Would highly recommend this to anyone that travels alot, or for anyone that is interested in weather conditions.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Great story, suspense & romance. All teens will love it, & adults might like it too. I couldn't put it down.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great packaging, great quality, great ports. Plenty of accessibility options for each Blu-Ray. I bought on sale for $20, one hell of a deal.
B005LAIGQE|4.0|I truly enjoyed this movie, partly because I remember the event in 1988. It was one of those events that sucked people in (like that girl who fell down the well or the miner's in South America). I couldn't get the news fast enough so I had a buddy of mine create a thing called the &#34;Internet&#34; so news could be gotten quicker.  John Krazinski was quite good as was, dare I say it, Drew Barrymore. I didn't care much for Kristen Bell's character. I felt bad for the whales and was sucked into the story yet again.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A lot of ado about a ridiculous situation where a naive college student is abused by a man incapable of love. He is only aware of himself and his needs. I would not recommend this book. Almost painful to read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator was the first app I downloaded and its been used plenty.  Simple, no frills tool that every Kindle should have because it comes in so handy.
B00846REIS|4.0|Another page turner!! After reading 50 shades of grey, the comparison is almost the same. I think the story line is a little better. I really enjoyed this book, waiting for the 3rd on to come out!!!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It's funny and shocking in several parts, but nothing I would watch again.  My husband thought the same thing, but it was an ok Saturday night movie.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Great.. works like a charm. I just purchased an e-printer and was able to print a picture from my phone.<br />Thanks HP
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game that makes you think!  My two kids, my husband, and I all love this game.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a really cute book. I love how Connor was so determined to get his girl. I hoped it would be a great book and it was.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|I, personally, do my training in a gym. Having said that, I do not want to be dependant upon a gym always being available to be. If I am on holiday, for example, or if for work I am in a hotel with no fitness suite, what are you going to do? As long as you have the willpower to push yourself to really throw yourself into these methods, you can get a great workout. Of course there is nothing cheaper than bodyweight training. There is also a lot to be said about a person really mastering their own body. This book explores many methods and describes them well. The book gets right to the point and gives all the detail you need.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|We got this set as the amazon deal of the day for $19 which was quite a deal for all we got in addition to the bluray/DVD which was priced the same on its own!! We are very happy with this purchase and all the additional goodies we got in addition to the movie that we love so much! I would highly recommend the sound of music for its wonderful story and catchy songs!!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Not to ruin it but my son whom loves this series even hated it. not 1 to buy.  Maybe a rent
B00020HEG6|5.0|While watching the prisoner of azkaban I couldn't help but notice how beautifully the music complimented the film and wanted to add the soundtrack to my music collection. John Williams is always brilliant!
B003QTUQGU|5.0|that why movies were created ..to make a masterpiece like this. Hope he will make more fairy tales, like The 12 months, or Mary Poppins...can't wait for the next..
B00770KR7W|5.0|This is a great action figure we love it and have it up on display on a ledge in our studio!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great entertainment for long waits. no you do not get all the games at once but more appeared as you beat the games. well worth free!
B001NFNFIK|4.0|Good cast, but not the best. They needed a worthy bad guy in mold of Legion Guidry from another novel Burke wrote.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|It's an interesting story, but the story contradicts itself in a few places and there is some redundancy.  There's also some inconsistency with the characters and their backgrounds/actions.  Having a gay protagonist doesn't supplement/enhance the plot at all.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really liked this game. Storyline was interesting and kept me wanting to play. Some of the games I couldn't get but there is a skip option so I want stuck.The only downside I would say is that only part of the game is free, if you want to finish the game you have to pay about $3. All in all though not a bad little game.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Live is always good, I get to experience the energy of the croud even though the live performance lacks the accuracy of the studio version, I find to be worth it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I love the book but towards the end i got a little sick of the crying. However I want to peer more into sky's life with her sexy boyfriend holder, the charming brekien and of course her realistic and somewhat scandalous friend  six. Here is to the life of linden sky hope davis
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LIVED this novel from the moment I read the first word. I laughed and cried, it touched me. A must read in which I will read again!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We didn't finish watching &#34;Ted&#34; because of the language and content. Bad language, bad acting, but we shouldn't have expected anything different from Seth MacFarlane. They did such a great job putting the trailer together that we were sucked in.
0439813786|5.0|This book is one that you can look at and read over and over. My son continually had it checked out from the library and I finally decided to buy it for him. He was so happy to have his own copy and shows it to everyone constantly. I have a feeling he will have it for years and years to come. The drawings are stunning.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|My daughters are very happy to have this new CD! They were very surprised to get this for Christmas! It is especially appreciated since the car radio does not work. Just the CD player works.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Amazing book by an amazing author. The first lines of the book are enough to suck<br /> you in from start to finish.
B0099114WO|5.0|Always love these 2 actors and when the movie was available I got it.  Right in time for my birthday to myself!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't read books, but my sister in law asked me to read it and I LOVED it! Great love story!
B001IMR7EQ|5.0|............ to remember the movie and sing along to the music of the great cult film.  I know I love too, I love to watch the movie in my head as I'm traveling down the highway or just mulling around the house doing this and that.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Never before has the clash of cultures and times played such an integral part, as the family is beginning to show division between those willing to adjust to change and those staunchly holding onto the old ways, even between spouses.  Dear Mrs. Levinson, Cora's mother, serves here to boldly state the issue.  The idealists/diehards emerge as the Dowager Countess, Lord Grantham, Lady Mary and Mr. Carson. Their position, though sympathetic due to attachment to their characters, is an increasingly difficult one to defend.<br /><br />The big changes in the opening Series 3 episode are the financial loss of the family and the introduction of Cora's mother coming for the wedding, with that blunt and indomitable personality.  To my viewing, she definitely daunts the Dowager, trumping her in audacity in nearly every encounter.  No doubt the financial vulnerability plays a strong part in that. It may be a case of whether you prefer blunt over acidity or vice versa.<br /><br />The attachment between Matthew and Mary was never so poignant as revealed in the night before wedding sequence at Mary's bedroom door.  Matthew is so richly warm as he affirms his love and repeats to Mary the words from Tom Branson that he could not be content in life without her, regardless of their disagreement.  So effective.<br /><br />The mystery still holds concerning Bates, as a darker side is showing up with his cell mate.  Since he has been so insistent in not revealing things to shield others in the past, perhaps that is still the case. I wouldn't be surprised if Anna's probings provide necessary evidence and we find that again, he has been acting in honor by not revealing something that could have cleared him.  As to his cell mate, the pressure of his circumstances could well account for his unwillingness to take anything off someone he doesn't have to.  A lot of good people believe in his character.<br /><br />This episode as seen on PBS severely breaks the smooth transition of story lines previously experienced, making a complete UK edition mandatory.  Hopefully, there will be help in the very rapid moving from one story line to the next, as presently it is a bit of a whiplash at times.  One is trying to digest what was just presented, but is immediately being thrown into another diverse and complicated scenario.  Before, the difference in the broadcast and full version was an abrupt introduction of a character without the lead up in the full edition, but now it is more a hurl from one venue to another, especially in the latter part.<br /><br />It will be very interesting to see how this central theme of change plays out among the parties, along with the various fates hanging in the balance and old scores to be settled.
B0097AQEG8|5.0|My album of 2012 mixes a bit of everything. Highlights for me  include  \\"when my train pulls in\\" and \\"Numb\\" just for that huge riff :) not to mention \\"bright lights\\" still being awesome.

I even give it 5 stars after mistakenly breaking the tab that holds the case together (completely my fault - not a design flaw)<br /><br />Get this tool set.  Well worth it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I chose this game because my grandkids were with me and they loved playing this game.  It was a new experience for me and I was able to experience it with them.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Excellent quality and no commercials! I recommend this movie to everyone. Amazon makes it so easy to stream your favorite movies.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|You would have to live under a rock not to have heard of Les Miserables! The book contains a lot of philosophy and historical details that obviously arent in the musical to such a great extent. If oy aye a lover of classics then this is for you.
B00932ANQM|4.0|As all Sparks books, this movie is somewhat predictable, but all in all a feel good movie and just what I was looking for on a night when my husband was out of town.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It wakes you up to the music you will pick and love. But it might be hard liking that song after because when ever you hear it next you will be thinking of getting up. But it's AWESOME!!!
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Maybe Ben Affleck should spend more time behind a camera than in front of it since he did direct it. This is a fascinating story about Charlestown Boston, a place I wasn't even aware of, and their #1 industry- bank robbery.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is great!! It's fun to get different swords and backgrounds!!! Awesome!! But, I for some reason can't open it now, I bought it a couple weeks ago..oh well, I'll figure it out!! GREAT GAME!!
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|This was the first Predator movie in more than 20 years that was not awful. It is easily the best one since the original (which is still the best). It is a good concept but it did feel like it was missing something that prevents me from giving it 4 stars.
0307951529|5.0|It's 5 stars because the story's are great and have great meaning behind them. I have my own business and find this book quite helpful. Apply the things that stick out to you. I have seen more demand since apply the things out of this book and a book called &#34;The Pumpkin Plan&#34;
B0009RCPY8|5.0|1 star for Ghostbusters 2. The first GBs is a Reagan-era classic; 3 friends lose their university grant and are forced to go into business for themselves. They face ghosts, poltergeists and the dreaded EPA along the way. GB2 sucks. Don't bother. They barely managed to show up for it and are obviously bored.
0938045768|5.0|I love this book so much that I've already referred it to 5 of my friends who are also planning on buying it.<br />It's just amazing how much you get out of this book. My health has increase and I am getting stronger. Your workout program can take as long as you like. Since I have a busy life I can only work out for about 45 mins a day. The first week of having this book I had to take a 4 day break because my body was so torn up from the work outs.<br />Get it, it will change your life
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|The first Iron Man was excellent especially the portion of it in the cave. There are a lot of good parts in the sequel such as the fight in Monaco  when Tony is trying avoid Mickey Rourke's electric whips but this movie just feels rushed. The central relationship conflict between Tony and Pepper could have been solved with a simple conversation of 1 sentence; I hate when movies do this. &#34;Hey Pepper, my arc reactor is slowly killing me and I need to find a new element to use.&#34; There. I just saved the plot 2 hours of bickering between Tony and Pepper. There is a lot of Avengers-building shoved into this film when they probably should have focused on the story. The fight at the end becomes sheer CGI porn and I lose interest. Definitely a step down from the 1st.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Sam Harris is a good writer and makes many excellent arguments. I was not convinced by his argument in this book, but it was worth the price to read it.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|kind of loud and dumb for a Star Trek movie. The cast all play their parts extremely well but the plot is a little hackneyed and I think it goes too far out of the way to please the hardcore fans by contriving alternate universes and time travel. Eric Bana's character doesn't have a rational motivation. Why not go to starfleet in the past and get them to not use the anti-matter as opposed to trying to destroy Vulcan and Earth like a crazy person? The characters run every place and scream at each other a lot and Kirk is in full-on sexual harassment mode all the time. It's definitely turned up to 11. Finally, they give no legitimate explanation how an ensign like Kirk would be knocked up several ranks to command the flagship of Starfleet- that's not how military-style ranking works for good reason. That's not to say the movie is bad- just frustrating in some ways. This one is worth picking up if you can get it at a discount.
B005VPRET4|3.0|I was thrilled that LEGO Friends came out. My daughter loves to build. She did do this and a couple others I got her. She'd do them all if I got them. This was for her 7th birthday. However, I was disappointed. She did them so quickly. They are easy. I feel LEGO dumbed this down for girls is all I can figure. But they didn't lower the price. Maybe purple and pink dyes are costly. The age on this says 6 - 12. I'd be SHOCKED an average 12 year old would care about this. However, this is the third Christmas my daughter - now almost 8 - has done pretty much all by herself the LEGO Christmas-themed sets that say age 12+. This year's did and had 1500 pieces. She was done in two days. No more than 8 hours. Three times asked for help - to locate something. Made one mistake that we could see. Makes me feel that LEGO teamed with the same folks who had t-shirts made that said \\"I'm to pretty to do my homework, so my brother does it for me\\" or something like that. And from reading reviews of the books that follow these characters put out by DK, superficiality reigns - I hope not reality. But should not frustrate any 7-9 year olds out there. And if you are fine with girls shone only in a certain light and can afford the whole city, that girl will likely be happy.

1846556007|4.0|I like this series so far.  I am not done with this book but so far I like it very much.  My book club members like the series, too.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|A film like this is difficult to define so perhaps the way I should talk about it is to just make some points and observations.  It is clear to me that Tarantino's view of the world is not the run of the mill.  He has an enquiring mind which informs how he approaches film making and the intellectual and visual stimuli he employs in his films. He makes you think about conclusions which you had drawn about certain things and makes you ask yourself whether you were lazy in the first place to have drawn them.<br />This movie is about a German bounty hunter in search of his \\"subjects\\" and who enlists the help of a slave, Django (whom he frees at his first meeting) and who is his constant companion throughout the movie on that search.  Django, the freed man, is also in search.  He is in search for his German speaking slave wife/woman of his dreams who was cruelly separated from him. I shall not go into the long climax of the movie save to say that the violence is quite spectacular (some might say gratuitous - but that is the point) and strangely beautiful in a visual sense.<br />Calvin Candie, an unbelievably malevolent plantation owner, played by Leonardo di Caprio is clearly the star of this movie whilst Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schultz (a retired dentist) who is the bounty hunter.  They are both Academy Award winners and their performances are breathtaking. Jamie Foxx who plays Django is someone you instinctively support throughout the movie and delivers a performance that also will not escape Oscar attention.<br />It could be said that the overall premise of this movie is unlikely but I don't think that that is really the point. This movie, I think even more than Inglorious Basterds (Tarantino's great film that garnered Christoph his well deserved Oscar - one of the best acting performances I have ever seen!), leaves you with images that haunt in a way that is well nigh inexplicable save to say that they captivated when they first occurred even if you had no idea they would.  It will never be to everyone's taste but then, this is Tarantino we are talking about!
B009VL28W2|5.0|I was in the stadium for this show, and I'll tell you what, Metallica did a great performance!! A must see!!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I enjoyed this movies action and suspence that I entend to buy it and put it in my movie collection for a later date. If I enjoy a movie as mush as I did this one I could enjoy to watch it over and over. Thanks
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Very addicting and fun.  I love the sound effects and splashes of colors. The directions to play the game are not very comprehensible.  But i play along the best I can and am having fun.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This album is great to chill too.  My family and I enjoy every song.  This album a must add to any collection.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am having trouble interacting with others on this app.  I cannot 'like' comments.  And it is not easy to respond to commenst either.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|We watched this movie over Christmas Break and it kept my attention despite Kristen Stewart.  It was an enjoyable evening in.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked this book because it was written by a neurosurgeon and he knows about the human brain and how it works.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Should of been better.  Love the cast but the action and the story left me disengaged and looking for something else
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|He always write such great books. They usually make me cry.  It's always nice to know that when you start to read his book it's gonna be good.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults alike. Steve Carrell's voice *makes* the movie. It's original, fun, clean and after my 3-year old's 10th time watching, still funny.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am in total shock and awe how this book twisted and turned to this ending. Nicholas Sparks once again has  me on the edge of seat, anticipating the excitement as I turn the pages. I'm starting to realize though, don't get me wrong Sparks is one  of my all time favorites, he always has to kill someone off. Whether it be a good or bad character, someone always dies. Trust me when I say YOU'LL NEVER see this ending coming. As  I was reading the ending I was pacing my room back and forth shouting, \\"No!\\", and \\"OMG!\\", then the tears came soon after. I'm sure my fiancé assumed I was going crazy yelling at my kindle! Best buy of 2012 and now 2013!!!
B003WE9TU8|4.0|First off, it's an enjoyable but gory read. The story is told as a series of reports from the perspective of different survivors of the zombie war. This is an intriguing format and it does add to the realism. Unfortunately, it does make the storyline seem somewhat arbitrary. The recounts are arranged chronologically, mostly, which develops the very simple story arc i.e. human race barely survives zombie war. However, characters are only developed episodically, as part of their reports, which denies the reader the opportunity to connect with a character over the course of the book. The reader may come to care about the human race in general but no single character is pivotal to the plot. Some readers may find this refreshing and others will find it leaves them cold. In a longer book, I could not see this narrative device working. This weakness is addressed in the screenplay of the soon to be released movie version and I think most readers will agree that was a necessity. The book is also unusual in that the technology which eventually defeats the zombies is cheap & mechanical. Advanced bio-chemical, ballistic and other exotic solutions simply do not work. Equally, tertiary sector workers have to learn basic skills to survive. This is social commentary about the dangers of technology and its false promises in the same way much of the book explores geo-politics. The author labours this point somewhat and that also be a turn-off for some readers. It's a fascinating book and has inspired many imitators but on reaching the last page the author deliberately leaves you with the sense that much is unresolved with Zombies / Zack still at large in some countries. Again, some readers may find this unsatisfying. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie but I expect it to have a more coherent narrative and at least one pivotal character. I suspect that those who think the book is perfect (I don't) may dislike the movie treatment and vice versa.
B00936A0RU|5.0|It is excellent.  Saw the movie in the theaters once and my daughter saw it three times.  As you can probably tell we loved it and had to own it.<br />Delivery was as always very good.
B0094KTCCY|5.0|Would definitely recommend this to any Muppets fan, and really anybody in general. Just a great, feel good movie. Would watch again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read until my eyes were shutting - couldn't put it down. Cant WAIT to start the next one.  Great story.
0547884591|3.0|This book has some really useful information at the front end, but the majority of the book is just another cook book.  I don't like most of the recipes and they are not quick to cook.  You'll spend hours just trying to find most of the exotic ingredients Tim uses in the recipees.  This book is not about efficient cooking, it's about how to effeciently become a Chef, who then takes a long time to cook meals.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|The app works well and I would recommend it.  You need to follow the people that you have a real interest in or it is boring.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game will keep you on edge through page one. The little whisper you hear whenever he's near scared me so much. This game is totally worth the $1.29 it charges. If you like slender on the PC, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I occasionally have downtime and needed something to play.  I chose this and it works well.  If you have access to WiFi, can get several levels of the game making it more interesting
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an incredible game that requires you to control a plaque. This game gives you a wide variety of choices. You can be a virus,bacteria, and other stuff. Instead of waiting to unlock something you can just buy it with real money.  I highly suggest this game to any one.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun,quick game. Harder than it looks but you can't stop trying! Love the sound effects of our little candy eater, so hate to disappoint him when I mess up! GOOD FUN!!!
B008XNPO20|5.0|My brother actually purchased the Tame Impala's Lonerism LP for me as a christmas gift. Hands down, the best, most used christmas gift I've gotten in years! I first started listening to these bad boys after the release of Innerspeaker. Lonerism continues their dream pop beats with lots of ambient vocals and instrumentals. My favorites would be: Elephant, Feels Like We Only Go Backwards, Mind Mischief, Music to Walk Home By, and Why Won't They Talk to Me. This album is an essential if you walk home or you like walking your dog in the local neighborhood. So just relax and enjoy this aesthetically pleasing LP! I promise Lonerism won't let you down!
B009JBZH54|5.0|First time ever using Amazon . I will be ordering more in the future. The box set of the dark night was a great choice .  My sons where very happy with their Christmas gift.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|I choose that rating because this dictionary tell you great words and they break the words down for you . Only thing i don't like about this dictionary is that i don't see the rest of the alphabet . I would recommend this book to middle through college students .
1449433251|5.0|For a long time it has been my wish to own The Complete Calvin and Hobbes product.<br /><br />My husband decided that he would buy, what I thought was a single book, for me for Christmas.<br /><br />The bookS arrived a couple of days ago. I was astonished and thrilled. There are 4 (four) books altogether and they are so heavy that I can hardly carry them. All of the books are glossy and have lots of coloured pages in them.<br /><br />Thanks so much Amazon for selling such a fantastic product for such a small price. I am delighted.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The ending left me hanging...but a steamy page turner for sure! Very romantically sad. I couldn't put it down at night!
B005HE5J7I|3.0|The facts are informational historically, and interesting,<br /> but the authors style was abit too laborius in telling the story for my taste.<br />I would still like to read his book on New York however for the historical info.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|It was an amazing book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I hope everyone out there enjoys it as much as I did. It was shocking yet emotional of what happened to panem!!!!#!!

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|So far I have enjoyed using this app but the only issue I have found is with the voice to text.  I tried using the voice to text in a meeting to take notes and only about .01% was valid.  Made for some funny reading after though.<br /><br />Works just like MS Office and saves documents in MS format.  Well worth the download.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Takes me right to my account for a quick check on the ol' mailing system. Fast and fairly easy to use.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I like that this is a quiet thinking game that doesnt have intense enemies or explosions. Relaxing and challenging. Lots of fun.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Can't stand going through extra steps with I want to search for something on my kindle... just gimme the source and I'm happy.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Boring and couldn't wait for it to be over.  Dancing was good, but that was it.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What is there to add ?the feelings it evokes ,<br />resonates and rings true.sad ,but true and beautiful.thank the author for this  feeling.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Can't wait to watch it again!  Great cast and lovable characters kept me interested all the way through the movie!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Absolutely wonderful book. I have shared it with many friends and all agreed It is a very important and inspirational book.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|Probably the most different musically of the three newest albums, but it showcases how diverse Green Day continues to be
0307913090|2.0|Why on Earth does every single character in these audiobooks sound like either a pirate or a leprechaun?!<br />It's all but impossible to tell one character from another when they all sound like they're doing a third-rate<br />impression of Blackbeard! It borders on the comical... and becomes tiresome after the 500th \\"different\\" character that sounds<br />like every other character.<br /><br />Want to enjoy an audiobook by someone who knows how to perform as<br />different characters? Pick up any of the Harry Potter books as read by the brilliant Stephen Fry!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I don't have HBO or Showtime at home, so the only way I can watch Homeland is through Amazon streaming to my PC.<br />I love this show! It is addicting.  I can't wait to watch an episode every night.  I'm just sad that I will be through the whole season 1 and have to wait until season 2 is available.  If you liked &#34;24&#34;, you'll love Homeland.  You really get hooked on the main characters and each episode has a zinger twist.  Love, love, love this series.
B004J64QR4|5.0|I thought it was wonderful..I loved the music and all the players..I couldn't leave it.The costumes were also fantastic...I wish that when I was younger I could have been a player...
B0086700CM|4.0|it is ok but if I look away for 1/2 sec I die it takes some skill to make it past 3000 meters
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|awesome. you can make cool vehicles and there are so many pieces with cool abilities. if you get it, prepare for fun
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What intelligent folks ought to watch.....might revive the viewing audience an un-dumb them up.....try it; you'll love it.<br /><br />Great show.
B00913DPW2|2.0|I really like hidden-object games but this one was almost impossible to navigate from one scene to another.  There was no way to address the problems so I just deleted it from my devices.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|The new Macbook Pro uses a slightly different power plug, and this adapter converts the old connector to the new.  The adapter is compact and light, and works like a charm.  I carry one with me wherever I go, in case I need to borrow someone's charger.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is a great game to play when you are bored.... People complain on how it cost money in the end but really acorns are something you can earn you don't have to buy them! Your spending to much time critisizing the game instead of enjoying its real quality's. I highly recommend that you buy this game... :)
B003VANOFY|4.0|I received these for the holidays and was immediately jazzed.  I've used them on average for 6-8 hours each day since 12/25/2012 and could not be more pleased.  The sound quality is excellent, I'm told I'm clean and crisp and clear on the other end over Skype, they're comfortable, and I can wander from my office to my kitchen and keep rockin' the tunes the entire time.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Incredibly comfortable for long periods of heavy use<br />* Wonderful sound -- I play mostly games and the surround sound adds an incredible depth to my games.<br />* Fits over my ears AND glasses, no problems<br />* The Logitech software makes it easy* to use and the included voice morphing is really fun<br /><br />CONS:<br />* The included driver CD did *not* work with my Windows 7 Home 64-bit.  I already own other Logitech gaming products and the software on the CD was older than my current install, but the current install didn't recognize the headset following the setup instructions.  I had to download the latest version and update manually to get everything working.<br />* The boom mike is nice, but does not stay up in the mute position.  A little more tension on the pivot would solve this nicely.<br />* BIGGEST PROBLEM HERE: Until yesterday the headset simply would not reconnect when I rebooted my computer.  I had to remove the dongle, reinsert, turn the headset on and off a few times, rinse, lather, and repeat to get it working.  Every day.  I was getting close to returning it until I figured out the solution (see below).<br /><br />IF YOUR HEADSET STOPS CONNECTING AFTER YOU REBOOT, TRY THIS:<br /><br />Open the Logitech gaming software.  It's probably already running, just click the icon on your system tray.  The headset should show up in the list, and if so, that's great.  Still no sound though, and the lights are all blinking, no connection, etc.  To fix that, fire up an app that produces sound.  Go to YouTube, fire up Winamp, whatever.  Start some sound playing.  THEN, and only then, turn on the headset.  It'll connect right away and work just fine.<br /><br />If Logitech would simply *mention* this little quirk in their documentation, I'd give this 5 stars.  Truly an awesome product once you figure out the little things.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Definitely one of the top apps on the market.  This apps does exactly what it says giving you complete control over your phone or tablet.  Not only can you organize, but you can take videos, pictures, and even panoramas and so much more.<br /><br />If you are considering buying this app, do not hesitate. I would buy this app even if it was 10 dollars. You have just stumbled upon one of the greatest apps out there.  GRAB IT WHILE YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE.
1451648537|4.0|open and honest narrative . very well written. gives a good of Steve jobs personality and drive for perfection along with his inability to understand social interaction.
B00838HRP2|1.0|No where does it state that the DVD will not play in my region. I bought a DVD in America, it should work on my DVD player. The same with the bluray from MovieMars, it won't play because it's not available in my country. What in the world!!?
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am 97% finished with this book and I love it. I cannot wait to read the third installment in the trilogy!
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|don't bother unless holed up due to a blizzard or there is absolutely no other movie to watch.  Would not recommend
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a great Movie. Great Cast. Awesome story telling by Wes Anderson. A must have for a movie collection.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I have a six year old son and he loves star wars.  The graphics are great on these movies.  They are some of the all time best and they don't have to worry about what is in them as far as scensoring them.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|That book was a w s o m e ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|By far my favorite superhero movie of all time! great price as well. i would definitely recommend it to a friend!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Great game however if you run thru credits to quick, you can't play again till the next day, unless you purchase credits. That's not going to happen!<br />A friend even tried to send credits as a gift to me, but they didn't come thru, yet her account shows they were sent?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|pretty good read, i read it because my friends were pretty into it and i wanted to see what the fuss was all about. i didnt regret it ,read it going to Cali for my sisters wedding and i finished it on the plane ride back! i would def recommend it. too bad the movie sucked!
B003719G40|5.0|I honestly believe that every couple should be forced to read this book before they are married.  It is a quick and easy read but the information is invaluable.  It doesn't matter how great or not so great your relationship is, it can always be better.  I plan on picking up the Love Language books for kids and teens also.
B009JBZH54|5.0|purchased 2 of these because its such a great deal one for me and the other for my girlfriends sister, oh did i mention the trilogy is awesome!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy reading, entertaining, romantic... I'm not used to this kind of novel, but I have liked this one in particular :-)
B008UUPOVM|4.0|Just got into Owl City, love this album. The price was under 5 dollars which was a steal for what I got. Def recommend this album.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is very fun and addictive game. The levels get progressively difficult. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a way to kill time and unwind.
0765325950|1.0|Unbelievable Tor...<br /><br />Do you even know the WoT fan base? Most of your WoT readers read on eReaders and Kindle. I can't remember the last time I bought a paper book. I WILL not be buying a hardcover, I'll read something else first. This is how bass akward it is... you should make the e-edition available first. Much easier to press a button than to ship dead trees. But I get it, you're greedy.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Its pretty good, only you can't do as much as you can on a computer. And, you can't do superflat. There are not as many resources.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love reading Mr. DeMille's books.  Plum Island keeps you intrigued and you never want the story to end.  Loved it.
B0086700CM|4.0|When you go to the store, it doesn't ask you if you are sure you want to buy this item. I had 33,ooo coins and I bought a 25,000 charcter. They need to ask for confirmation before purchasing.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay had me hooked from the start and never let. An exciting, heartbreaking ride that keeps you guessing until the very end.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Great twist on the \\"space time continuum.\\" And if you enjoy super heros/powers you'll find this movie has a cool surprise or two.
B0049VZ222|5.0|From the opening scenes I was hooked on TWD.  Great characters, rapid action and and well thought out storylines keep this the only show I wait for each week.  When I was able to purchase the season one DVD, I could enjoy the story all over again.  Good Stuff!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|A little hard to follow, but still o.k.  I have been re-reading many older (&#34;classic&#34;) books and this one isn't my favorite, but since it has been getting hew hype because of the movie release, I thought, &#34;why not&#34;.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great to read as my daily Bible! Wonderful to use every day. What more can I say?  The end. Amen!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The movie hit on some of the scenes from the first movie and made a few good ones up. Its an ok movie if there is nothing else to watch.
030758836X|1.0|This book is one of the best for 2012? I wish I didn't bother. If you love miserable people who live in a resentful world, you'll love this.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Entertaining, but slow at times. The ATF character was totally unbelievable. Could have waited until it was available on Netflix
B00992CF6W|5.0|From what I know of the game, it allows kids to be creative while building lots of structures.  It seems like a good clean game for kids.  I wouldn't think the simple graphics scheme would be so effective but it really is.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like to play when I am looking at  television.  I need to find out how to move the cards where I want them to go when using my stylus.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Out of slots and prize grabber, this is probably 3rd on my list but I still put quite a bit of time in it.  It really is a lot of fun.
B003B02O14|3.0|A disappointing ending, just when everything else was working itself out. The main character should've learned about being too trusting.
B0091THRCU|2.0|Low Quality leather.  Fit is much too tight and no reason for it. I have purchase much better cases in the past in respect to quality of leather and fit.<br /><br />This leather is so low quality it almost feels fake.
0765325950|1.0|....Now I'll wait for a secondhand hardback. You have lost money. I guess it ensures more copies for libraries if the kindle is delayed though.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book changed my life and it was sooo exciting. Will be reading many times more. Great book, very cool
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics. great overall game play. G5 always seems to come up fresh ideas. the story line is great gives you a feeling of accomplishment.
0307165485|5.0|Absolute favorite book as a kid.  I must've been very young when I got it, 3 or 4, maybe from my grandparents.  I spent countless hours looking through it. Before I could read, and after.  I've purchased it several times as a gift for other kids, like my son.<br /><br />Richard Scarry does beautiful illustrations with short stories and pages where no story is involved but a myriad of things are going on.  The illustrations are fun and very kid friendly with animals in everyday clothing, do everyday things. They are rich in detail and every thing is labeled to help young minds learn.  The warm and cozy drawings had me daydreaming for hours on end as a young child.<br /><br />It's similar to something Disney would do but less homogenized and more personal, with much more warmth.  This is Richard Scarry's best book I've come across.  It has 88 wonderfully illustrated stories and almost 300 pages.  The book teaches all the basics, numbers, letters, geography, nursery rhymes, manners...you-name-it!, in an enjoyable way that makes learning fun.  If you're looking for a wonderful kid's book that will keep your child entertained for hours, this is the book!<br /><br />(It's appropriate before your child can read because of the fun, detailed pictures)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book it was great I cried a lot. It was very sentimental in the eyes of so many people that all relate to August. It is the true feeling of LOVE and kindness.<br />Mias precept<br />All you need is you and kindness and LOVE and you can make it through anything.- mia
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Bought this as gift for hubby at Xmas and he thinks this is such a funny movie.  I think it's good too
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I don't play this game, but my daughter very much enjoys this game. I have tried a few times, but loose patience and give up. But my daughter and her friends love it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great condition, great value, and came with a neat book of pics and behind the scenes info.  Both people I gave this to loved it!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I thought this was actual youtube. all you can do is download everything, you can't view anything without downloading it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have read many historical novels, so I am familiar with events during this time period.  It was interesting to read about these characters and how events affected them.  The book was both informative and entertaining.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. I bought it for my daughter, but its kinda hard for a five year old. I love it though.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It was a very interesting book.  I did not always like Steve Jobs, but I certainly have a lot of respect for what he did with personal computers.  I have never used an Apple computer, but recognize that what he did had a great deal of influence on the computer I am using.  Great book.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|The kids like this better than angry birds now.  I don't really like it because I can't see the point. Far more goal oriented and hence like angry birds.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this novel very much.  I had just finished Fall of Giants, and was thrilled that this was available.  I was not disappointed.  I am now looking forward to the third book in the trilogy.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We all love Elf.  The premise is great and the comedy is timeless.  Just what you want in a holiday movie.
B006G4F8OW|5.0|The Bandai Monkey D. Luffy figurine is quite beautiful and affordable. I reccomend this product to anyone that loves One Piece or knows someone that does love One Piece. Note, The stand it comes with looks nice, however, the figurine itself doesn't stick to it all that well. Therefore, if you want to make sure it stays on the stand just take a dab of super glue to keep it in place.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I just received a Kindle as a gift and I was looking for a few free or inexpensive books to download to test out how I liked it.  I came across this book and read it in just a few sittings.  It was light, but I thoroughly enjoyed it - found myself laughing out loud in parts.  I would recommend it to a friend - I have downloaded other similar ones that I couldn't finish, but this was really good!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was quite a good read,kept me captivated, even though, I knew what was coming next, half way through<br /> the book.<br />Fiction is marvelous, as I'm sure most would agree, the boy man in this book was to say the least, more emotionally in tune with Sky than the average teen male ever could be. I am glad I read this, and wish more abuse stories turned out this way,.
0553801473|5.0|I can't read these books fast enough. This one was was no exception. Great read, couldn't put it down, very highly recommend.
B009R5GR1K|2.0|Was too difficult to manipulate on my Kindle.  Had to have my Wi Fi on to use iit which really runs down my battery..
B008D28HYS|5.0|I have completed all the puzzles in all the levels at least 3 times now. This is a very addictive game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Written from the viewpoint of the grim reaper, it gave a unique perspective. I felt the reality and emotion of the characters in the story. The horror.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love to play this game-app works well and it is challenging. I would recommend the app to anyone for games
B007IXWL2C|5.0|although this is an intense story i did not want to put it down. christian finally opens up and everything eventually falls into place.
B005R32L66|5.0|love this app-dtr away in another state and can video chat with her and keep in touch-I would recommend it
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed this second book as much as the first one in he series. Larsson is a great story teller and writer.
B0040UAYI4|2.0|I got this so i could whip around and kill people shooting my from behind like on the PC with FPS games, but it doesn't work like that. The faster you move your mouse the slower you turn. I tried playing with the advanced settings and nothing I did made it like the PC. Don't waste your money!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Larsson is a great writer. You will pick up this book and you will not put it down until you are finished. Just as good as the two previous ones.
B009K45Y62|4.0|The display is great, but I'd rather have had the discs in a &#34;normal&#34; case, as opposed to the somewhat awkward, kind of cheap looking, round case. Other than that, even the box, which is numbered is really cool. Based on the current price, this is already a collector's item.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|The Alchemyst is a wonderful opening story about Nicholas Flamel and the knowledge he holds and passes on to two special siblings. The story is intriguing and grasps the reader's attention instantly. What makes the book and series even more captivating is that so much of it is rooted in real life and well-known myths and legends. Part of the fun is discovering how the different immortals' and elders' lives interweave and overlap. Would recommend this book to readers of all ages.
B003NX75B8|4.0|Love John Green not my favorite of his books but it was school pretty fantastic. Pretty good book. Read it.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I love this cover for my Kindle. Not sure what the other reviewers are referring to, my Kindle (5th generation) fit perfectly inside of it and I love the color scheme. It was a great price and shipping was quick. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|It never ceases to amaze me how the Name of Jesus, the Christ, makes it into the scripts of films and presumed to be funny. If they knocked a Muslim or Islam like that, they'd be hunted down and killed, yet (somehow) it's 'okay' to trash the Christian faith and God. I'm sure this review will go over like a lead-balloon, and if so, that's due to the depravity of the readers' spirit who align themselves with such antisemitism (Jew-hating) and anti-Christ values.<br /><br />Darkness cannot stand the Light, and will strike out against the Light. However, Light wins every time.<br /><br />Sure, the premise of the movie is funny, I mean  it's a walking, talking teddy-bear after all. But when you lace a movie with such gutter values (many of which I didn't even address), giving it a 1-star is a few too many.<br /><br />Mark, give me a call. We seriously need to talk.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher novel--you never know where these books will take you!  Great plot line, believable characters, and fun to see how he will get himself out of this current situation.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Drawn out and predictable. Weak character development. Total snoozer. Only finished it to be sure I wasn't missing something. I wasn't!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Real story of what often happens in the adolescent world and the pressures exerted on the young. The facts about child abuse is all too true.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic book!  Liked this better than the first.  Could not put it down at times.  Can't wait to read MockingJay!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|This brings back to mind hours upon hours that I wasted, (uh, spent improving my eye hand co-ordination) in the game rooms at the local shopping centers.  Really enjoy this blast from the past, just takes a little time getting used to the controls.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!!  I absolutely loved this book.  It was very well conveyed.  The twist in the middle is not where I expected this book to go and I appreciated it immensely.  I honestly thought it was going to be your typical teen romance.  I bought this book because of the five star ratings it received.  I am a 40 year old woman who had no idea it was based on an 18 yr. old romance.  When I started reading it, I was thinking \\"Ah, I wasted my money.\\"  But let me tell you, I did not waste my money.  This book is fabulous!!  I loved Holder because he reminded me of my husband so much and why I fell in love with him.  There is no denying why Sky falls in love with him also.  To me, even though the book was centered around her, he pulled everything together.  Without this character, it would have been, a \\"typical teen romance.\\"  Thank you Colleen Hoover.  I cannot wait to read Slammed and Point of View!!![[ASIN:B00AQ3K8IU Hopeless]]
B00867GHS8|5.0|Man glad this finally came out on dvd when my kid is old nuff he's gonna  love this movie. great condition and arrived in a timely manner
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Loved it!!!  It reminded me of the Sing Off!!! The only thing I didn't like was the guy charcter thats falls for Anna Kendrick's character.  He played it to cheesy.  But other than that, great!!! [[ASIN:B00APUYWYA Pitch Perfect]]
B008FRFN7A|5.0|After reading several bad reviews for different printer apps, I came across this one from HP and was pleasently surprised. It prints documents, photos, and attachments. I had no problems installing the app. It automatically found and connected my Kindle Fire HD to my wireless HP Color LaserJet Pro CP1525 network printer. Hopefully, there will be an update to print web pages some day, but for now I'm happy with it and the $0 price tag!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I don't care what people say.. This movie was fantastic.  I thought Emily Blunt was the best part of the movie.  But it was different than any other movie out there.  Five stars from me!!![[ASIN:B00A9X9TIW Looper]]
B0091REZMW|3.0|There is alot of things going on.  Still using the hit and miss method.  Bought game because my kids really liked it but I guess they are better at it than me!
B003QP4BJM|5.0|alternative view to the prevailing notion things are no better than they were. shows effectively that things are getting better and will continue to do so for some time despite government and media  assertions to the contrary
B003ZSH606|5.0|I was walking downtown during my lunch break and my ear buds were pumping \\"Two Completely Different Things\\" and I had to restrain myself not to break out into crazy boogie down mode right there on the sidewalk and not give a care. Thank you Jay Kay.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was really into this game...couldn't put it down. Only thing that was a bummer was once I hit the $4.99 buy it, I bought the game and I was done with the whole game within the hour... wish it was longer.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was totally engrosed<br />it was not the type of book I would<br />have normally pick. The short<br />preview got my attention.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Watched this because of a friend's recommendation and I'm hooked.  I would definitely recommend to others. I watched it on Amazon Prime which I love also and have cancelled my subscription to Netflix.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I'll tell you why. It has characters that you can really get in touch with; like you're part of the novel. It has a plot that's not exactly unique but the author gives it heart and made it her own. Writers Dr o what they do to get emotion out of people. This book made me laugh, cry, smile, and certainly frustrated. But it is now one of my absolute favorites. I plan on encouraging everyone I meet to read this book and I also plan on re-reading it again and again. Absolutely brilliant.
B0020M99LC|4.0|I'm a big Bond and Daniel Craig fan and I can say I really enjoyed this movie.  Not so much the next few, but this was great.
B00881VLCE|5.0|because i like them<br />i like putting them together<br />i wish there were more like these.<br />anyone who likes working puzzles
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a very good book I couldn't put it down once I started it I am glad I decided to read it
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i picked this rating because it keeps you trying.<br />i like the challange but they are hard to knock off<br />i would recomand it to someone who likes a challange
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|struck the right balance between too easy and too frustrating. there is minimal back-and-forthing, which I appreciate in adventure games.
B00130UFY2|5.0|We loved the film, but were frustrated when the streaming suddenly paused for quite awhile at two different times. Not sure what the problem was.
B005LAII0I|5.0|After seeing a few versions of the Snow White story, I really didn't know what to expect of this.  I was impressed!  How do you update a story that has been around forever.  You change the viewpoint.  I actually liked Julia Roberts as the wicked Queen!  And having Snow rescue the prince was just a touch of genius. The dwarves were fantastic. And Nathan Lane.  I love Nathan Lane, and he is fantastic in anything. This movie is one I can and will enjoy watching many times over. It takes everything you thought you knew about the story, and changes it up! And the twist with the king is something you never see coming. Watch it, you won't be sorry!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I fell in love with Katniss and Peeta and felt like I was right there with them. Now I cannot wait to see what happens next.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|You just can't help the feeling you know these people.  The American Pie franchise is alive and kicking in this latest follow up to the preceding 7? shows, and it catches the viewer back in the web like the original one.  It has renewed my faith in sequels. In getting the whole cast back together it has caught the fire of the first couple of shows, and it is a joy to watch.
B007MDB548|5.0|You can never go wrong with Tinkerbell in our house and there was no way Santa was passing this year without dropping this one my our daughter's stocking.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Definitely a huge improvement on the previous version. Well cast, well acted, fast-moving and fun. Beckinsale was my favorite villain of 2012.
B005LAII08|5.0|Mydaughter loves all the princesses and now that their is a tomboy-ish one, she's in heaven.  Her favorite characters are the triplet little brothers.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I will recommend this book to all my friends. I found it very well-written and readable. I thought the author did a good job of incorporating deeper messages concerning death, friendship, commitment, etc. The book was written with much humor. Furthermore, I enjoyed the format of the walk across England, having written a book myself about my trek, &#34;Walk the Land - A Journey on Foot through Israel.&#34;
B007OV9EYG|5.0|Couldn't ask for a better Dr. Seuss movie.  Horton was a great one, but I think the Lorax gives a little bit better life lesson for the kids to learn.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|no value at all, not even funny, better to have a root canal than watch this movie, sray away from this
0679721037|1.0|Hardest book to read. My daughter had to read this for school and it was painful to get through it. There are way too many details about things that don't seem relevant to the story. I had to read it out loud to help her understand and even as an college-educated adult, I struggled.<br />We will have to learn about this piece of history in a different way because this book didn't leave us feeling that we truly understand it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This camera bag works very well for my wife's new Canon T4i.  Fits the body, lense, memory cards, manuals, lens covers, very easily and with room to spare.  You could easily fit two camera bodies and two lenses each in it I believe.<br /><br />The bag is made well, with sturdy zippers and internal and external stitching which is important when you have little ones.  We recently spent about 12 hours in the car over the holidays.  In and out of hotel rooms, family residences, etc... and this bag held up fantastic.  The adjustable compartments didn't shift while traveling or carrying the bag around either which was great.<br /><br />I have only one single gripe about it, there is no way a full grown man could actually wear it like a back-pack. :)  I have to carry it, the straps are just to small for it to fit comfortably on my back.  My wife however loves the way it fits her.
145162607X|4.0|I have been a big fan of Philippa Gregory since first discovering her book THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL at a local garage sale. She writes in such a way that her stories seem to suck the reader in from the very first page. The care she has for each book that she writes is definitely shown by the research she does. She tries her hardest to write each character in as realistic a light possible, and that is what makes her an amazing historical fiction writer.<br />THE KINGMAKER'S DAUGHTER basically tells the story of Anne Neville. A girl who experiences much including loss, treachery, defeat, and victory throughout her journey to the throne. Her voice is the narrative of each page, and her thoughts are the driving force.<br />The story begins with Anne as a nine-year-old girl witnessing the crowning of a new King and Queen of England. The reader finds her, in those beginning pages, completely in awe of Elizabeth Woodville, a woman with a meager past who captured the King's heart. However, that awe is soon short-lived when Queen Elizabeth starts to show her true colors in order to try and secure her family's place as royalty. She consults her husband, King Edward, in many treacherous acts in order to gain familial domination throughout England and its surrounding neighbors.<br />Anne, and her sister Isabel, soon become pawns in their father's game to overthrow the current King and his tyrannic Queen in order to place one of his own on the throne. However, unlike her sister, Anne is brought from one side of the battle to the other becoming first an ally, then an enemy, and back again. She longs to be able to decide her own fate on her own terms, but soon finds that this is much harder to do than one might think.<br />I quite enjoyed this book. Just the fact that it was Anne's own point of view made it seem more real to me. It was as if I were her, fighting for my place in a world full of people willing to lie and kill just to be able to rule. It was as if I were the one losingso much for my chance to be Queen.<br />One of Philippa Grepory's best.<br /><br />For more reviews by me, visit:<br />attackofthebookworms.blogspot.com
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun and suspensefull! 5 stars! Fun for the puzzles and the story line. Makes me want to play it all the time. This game is a must if you like to have fun.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about Mitch Rapp, the latest one in a continuing series.  I look forward to the release of the next book.
0312330537|5.0|This is the most engaging novel I've read in years. A highly evocative immersion into the cultures and mores of today's India. A flawed but heroic protagonist makes a personal and spiritual odyssey and takes you along for the ride.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app has provided the most entertainment of any that I have purchased. I am currently playing the game on the brutal setting and a couple of the disease types are giving me trouble, but I am hoping that the game will continue to expand.
B00007J5VN|5.0|I am a huge Bob Fosse fan and love this movie!  It arrived quickly and I am very happy with it.
0316228532|1.0|I have always been a huge Rowling fan with her Harry Potter books but this was a major disappointment. I gave up half way through because there didn't seem to be any hope of anything interesting ever happening.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand our millitary and what unexpected conditions can come up in a mission that goes wrong...
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Great movie that I've been wanting to watch for a long time. Love getting things on amazon instant video. So easy to do.
030716327X|5.0|Had this book for my kids,it wa one of there favoritea. now I giving it as a gift to another new family
B003MYYJD0|5.0|If you are considering buying this watch BUY IT! You will not regret it. I never get extended warranties. I am getting one for this watch. Delivery was quick. 2 day. The packaging from Amazon.com left a little to be desired( it was just boxed and taped closed. No type of cushioning at all.) .... Anywayzzz... The watch is nothing short of beautifully made... worth every dime...
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I have been waiting to watch this movie. And I have to say it did not disappoint me. It was very interesting and the visual well executed.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I have a 1 yr old and a 2 yrs old and we stumbled across these during the Christmas season on Sprout. They never sit still for more than 30 secs and when it came on, my 1 yr old sat down in front of the tv for 30 mins. I was sooo happy to finally eat my breakfast sitting down :)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I read a lot. I read whatever sounds good to me at the time. I had no idea the story I was about to read would be so raw & intimate in not the best of circumstances at times... but nonetheless a truly great at read. I like stories where not always is the person getting the happy ever after, but the realities of life instead. I also believe some people are just meant to be together. The story here is heartbreaking, but so good Cried in the end & I don't cry often!
0060899220|5.0|Mr Bourdain was great in this book funny and witty, Will keep you laughing the whole time you read it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Meeting Sky was a blessing. Ordinarily I do not care for the background subject matter,but it was well presented and unlike Oprahs book club books entirely meaningful in the context of the story. Reading more of Colleen Hoover is in my immediate future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much; it's so great!  I play this so much and I recommended it to all of my friends! It is 10x better than Temple Run will ever be.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very fun and addicting game. Although not quite as much fun as where's my wayer; it nother hit similar to it. Love it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app I've tryed so many calculator apps that it's sad but I am so glad that I found this app I use it for everything!
B001CJJWWA|5.0|Just one of the concerts would be worth the cost but you get a number of them and, they are not censored like the ones on FUSE or MTV. THe black out of the lyrics is a real pain on TV and this corrects the issue. Also, there are more songs on the DVD.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is great for a little kid.  I even like it and I'm 19 it could be better but its simple and fun at the same time.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The series was great and I wish it was still on the air but I am happy to have the series in my movie library.
B009X01GJ2|2.0|This case is made very well but once you put your kindle inside you cannot take it out.  I was going to buy another case for back up and when I was going to take the kindle out I couldn't.  This case is good if you will only keep this case and never take it off.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Great gift to my husband! The series was short but sweet! I wish it was still on the air but I am glad I got a copy to give to my husband!
157421327X|5.0|I've been Zentangling for a couple of years, and this is a perfect 'get-started' book, filled with great designs. This copy was for my niece who loved my copy so much, she wanted one for herself.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I love this movie and am very happy I can share it with my children. I don't have many kids movies so I am working on building my childrens library.
B006O6F932|5.0|I was looking for this School set and came across this seller, I actually was able to save over $20 ordering it than purchasing it at a store. My friend spent $85 while I ordered and had it shipped directly to me for less than $70!!!! The price was perfect for the holiday season timing, and with the money saved I was able to make my daiughters holiday a lil more Monster High
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is so funny and I havent seen it in a long time so I bought this movie. I loved being able to watch it with my family!
1906735875|5.0|I've never read any of the Judge Dredd comics before and decided get this book to start the collection. I don't regret it at all.<br />The design work (cover and pages) is impressive; it actually looks like an old comic book.<br />The first stories are good to know better about the character and the universe, even with some continuity issues with the script and the B/W art.
141659521X|5.0|As this work proves, don't mess with Mitch Rapp even when he has his memory befuddled by a concussion in Afghanistan.  In this book, Vince Flynn has woven an  intricate tale of duplicity and double dealing.<br /><br />The action takes you from the Washington, D.C. area to Afghanistan to Pakistan.<br /><br />Mitch Rapp, with the blessing  of the CIA Director, Irene Kennedy, investigates the disappearance of one of the Clandestine Service's top man is Afghanistan.<br /><br />Mr. Flynn has woven a wonderful narrative dropping hints and clues until the narrative reaches its conclusions in typical Mitch Rapp fashion.<br /><br />Great read and I recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best TV series out there. Season 3 perhaps felt a little less packed compared to season 1 and 2, but still superb entertainment. Can't wait for season 4!
B007JNWQZS|5.0|Perfect for the Quentin Tarantino fan in your life!!! Pefect Christmas present for my boyfriend-he has already watched both movies!
B001QB9H10|5.0|Gave my son transporter and transporter 3 for christmas....I gave him signed copy of transporter 2 by Jason Statham a few of years ago.  I meet Mr. Statham at a benefit ...His new movie was just out.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Very exciting! I can't wait to read the next one in the series. I will be recommending it to my family.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Because I loved the first 6 chapters in the free preview, I know I will enjoy the remaining chapters.  But I am saving it for my vacation reading.  It probably will be a 5 star as usual.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again, Vince Flynn continues to deliver as great book, as great as any of his other works.  ALL of his books are great ...except for Transfer of Power ( his third book) ...which was very good...but not great.  I think you will really enjoy reading his books in the order they were published. When you get to Transfer of Power, just keep in mind it, it isn't his best work, but it sets up some events in the life of the main character in his books,Mitch Rapp, that will make the future Vince Flynn books more enjoyable to you.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I felt like I was watching one of the episodes while reading this. It was also great how much it went into Bobby 's past and filled in on a lot of things, such as the things with Rufus and John that we never really found out. A great book.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I'm a sucker for Musicals and singing, which the singing was awesome. As far as the movie itself goes, it was cheesy but entertaining.
B0079K4WEE|5.0|I was first attracted to this movie as it starred two of the people whose work I enjoy. Yes, I succumbed to inferences based on the cover design. (You get your own inferences!) But the story was NOT anything like what I expected! And, unless you know something about the theme of this movie, it will be a surprise to you, I dare say. I can't say that it was a &#34;pleasant&#34; surprise, either. But I found it to be a very stirring and thought-provoking movie. It will give you a lot to think about ... although you may choose NOT to think about it!
1451696191|5.0|Great story of the people that you know you are friends with, who you love, who you cherish.  Great book to read, even for people beyond their years.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|As you see, I gave it five stars.<br /><br />There's a nice sort of post modernist surprise ending.  The characters are engaging, things seem real, and the plot is fun.
B007MU85D0|5.0|These guys popped out of nowhere.  Great album.  Very talented musicians.  Their sound is like no other group that I have heard.
0670024813|4.0|4.5 Stars.  Jared Diamond's breadth and depth of understanding of human societies is truly impressive.  In \\"The World Until Yesterday,\\" he compares \\"traditional\\" societies to modern, Western societies, and while the book is not of the paradigm-shifting status of \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" it is a very worthwhile and compelling read.  Traditional societies are those that have had no or limited contact with the modern world and that live in relatively small groups without modern conveniences.  His purpose is to show the positive and negative attributes of each type of civilization and specifically, what we can learn from the traditional societies.  Diamond makes many compelling arguments for adopting some of the practices of the traditional societies, especially in the areas of child rearing and elder care.  However, one of his most interesting conclusions regards the field of psychology.  He states that virtually all precepts and standards in psychology are based on investigations of W.E.I.R.D. societies - Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic.  By comparing traditional societies to Western societies, Diamond shows that this limitation in psychology often leads to inaccurate and/or skewed conclusions.  In fact, one can't help but question the entire basis of Western psychology after reading \\"The World Until Yesterday; What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies?\\"
B002NLY0V4|5.0|Great season.  I don't want to spoil it for everyone, but it was a great follow up to the 4th season.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Jaw dropping plot twists. Beautiful character development, excellent dialogue and an ending that will have you begging for more. Tomorrow isn't soon enough to start reading the next book. I recommend this to anyone. It was a great book.
B000JY8F22|5.0|I have wanted to see this movie for soooooooo long.  The only reason why I wanted to see it because of Damien Rice's beautiful song &#34;The Blower's Daughter&#34;.  I watched it and enjoyed the plot thoroughly.  Pretty raunchy. :)
B000HKYA1I|5.0|This is heartwarming and gut wrenching at the same time.  I would highly suggest watching it. Be prepared to laugh and cry.
B005MYEPXC|3.0|Good story line, but Rachael McAdams character in this movie is horrible.  She is not the type of actress to portray such a (censored). Haha.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Looks good, good graphics and informative. I love it. A little choppy on my vtab1008 sometimes but certainly not a deal breaker. It's free!
B008RC72G8|5.0|I love everything Johnny Depp does.  This movie was amazing just like the first one.  I enjoyed it and brought back lots of memories.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I can listen to this album all day I mean it never gets old, in fact it gets BETTER every time I listen to it. At first I used to think the second part of the album wasn't as good but after each listen, it gets better. Recommended to fans of music of any genre.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|Who doesn't love Talking Heads?  Fantastic live Blu-ray.  For the year the concert was recorded it came out clear and fantastically.  Great buy.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this season so muh better then last season. Less scary and gory just to shock you, i feel its better planned out hopefully meaning we'll get a better ending this season.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I'm a huge geek.  I love video games, especially for Zelda.  I love all the video game references and the story line.  I have looked into the graphic novels.  I love this!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Like oliver Stone, but it didnt seem like an Oliver Stone movie at all. The story revolves around the woman, but they make her character worthless and empty.
0316056863|5.0|I was laughing out loud on the airplane, in the office, at home.  This books is HILARIOUS! Tina Fey by far has surpassed my expectations.  What a great book.
0525952926|5.0|This trilogy is very good. History is fascinating and the characters' live intertwine in such a way as almost believable, if a bit too coincidental. But, hey, this is great fiction.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I watch this movie WAY too much.  I laugh every time I watch it even if I have watched a million times.
B00633W614|5.0|Very enoyable readable series.  Love reading about this period in time - my parents generation plus. Am waiting for the next installment this spring. Great book to travel with.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. I really enjoyed this game. I just wish it took longer to beat. I would recommend this game to an anyone who enjoys hidden object games.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I love the movie, but really, REALLY love the soundtrack but not all of the songs from the movie are on here, and some of the songs on the cd are performed by artists that were not in the movie....but anyway it 's a great CD.  I love Gweneth's voice.  One of my faves for sure!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George RR Martin is capable of catching your attention from page 1 with his intriguing fantasy  story. The plot and scenes are vividly described and the shift between the different characters works really well. The books are difficult to pause from and I have lost many nights sleep on his account. And I still carry on...
B004ADB17Y|5.0|Very engaging even for our 4 year old!  It's in my top favorite movies that I can watch over and over again!
B00563M11M|4.0|Yet another excellent addition to the \\"Vimes/guards\\" strand of the discworld series. This one sees Mr and Mrs Vimes head out to the country house they own, for a supposed holiday. As you would expect, with Sam Vimes around not everything goes to plan. Plenty of sleuthing and action, goblin rights issues and a touch of \\"Midsummer Murders\\" make this one of TP's best offerings yet in my opinion.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Great quality I will recommend this provider to anybody interested in purchasing items from here. The dvd was in great conditions.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|alt-J have created an incredible musical experience with An Awesome Wave. Nearly every song is layered with rhythms and beats that never seem to get old. The vocals are well and truly on a page of their own. Probably one of the most enjoyable albums I have purchased in years.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a powerful and emotion story, it left me breathless how Ms.Hoover wrote the pain so well for the two main characters and I felt it...I highly recommend, that you read this book, but get something more up beat after you done reading this story...But I do highly recommend this book..
B00AAX68HG|1.0|These pudding monsters love nothing more than to slide the opposite way I want them to, which is usually right off the board.  Until this gets fixed, not worth a look.
1400052173|5.0|It was a great book and it was in perfect condition when I received it. I would highly recommend this book.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|Addicting, challenging, interesting.  If you like bejeweled, you'll love this game.  The only complaint I have with this version is the slowdown during some battles, esp during a long chain.  Other than that, love this title.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A real page- Turner!  I love this author and will definitely read more of her works.  Interesting and complex characters.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|I have both a kindle fire and an ipad,  This works great on my ipad, but when I try to watch a live stream on the kindle, it slows down to a crawl on even the lowest quality.  Disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|the hunger games trilogy is awesome, I couldn't put it down.  Both my teenage girls are slso reading the second book and loving it
B0074MZSWW|3.0|THEIR SOUND IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT, SOME REMIND ME OF THE GREAT JANIS JOPLIN. I HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM THEM
0525478817|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter who is a John Green fan - it was signed since I bought it in presale (a promotion at the time)  I am very pleased with the purchase and my daughter loved the book - it is now a part of her complete John Green Collection.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I think its very creative and good quality. I do wish that the goblins would stay away for longer.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love this app. I have it on my phone and can listen to my music on cloud player with just a touch of the app. Thumbs up for the inventors of this. I love having my favorite music at my finger tips.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a very awesome book to read!! One of the few books I could not put down!!! Can not wait until the movie and the next book of the trilogy to come out!!
B0041T52S6|5.0|My Sophomore asked for this, and received 2 copies for Christmas.  He loves it so much, we decided to keep the 2nd copy instead of returning it, so that he could give it as a gift at the next upcoming bday party he attends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was pure adventure about love and sacrifice. I ENJOYED this novel, Collins knows how to hook a true reader into her books. Five stars all the way!!!!!
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|My husband asked for this for Christmas and was delighted to receive it.  Couldn't have been happier with this purchase on Amazon.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|I got it for my boyfriend for the holidays. It came in a brand new package, sealed and all. He loves it.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Great to get back to the original.  Always loved the story, but only knew movie versions.  Very interesting to see the differences btwn Dickens' story and the TV story.  Illustrations are great, too--so NOT post-modern.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I've heard people say this wasn't as good as the 2nd one.  That may be true, but I still think it's a fantastic film on its own and a great way to end the trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not much of a reader, but this book was enthralling. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Part 2 steps it up, From brutal rendetions Batman's crushing punches, Jokers an omnisexual, truly homicidal killing nightmare to Superman's immense power yet patriotic imbecilic servitude this is the finest adult animation DC has ever produced . Be warned this is violent and bloody with the Joker scenes being painted red with chilling death scenes. The Superman Batman throw down is truly epic and cinematic with a movie quality score. Peter Weller does a fantastic job capturing the hyper intelligent, brooding, serious and pragmatic older man Batman who's burning rage cannot be quenched from his traumatic childhood scarrring.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great read, I couldn't put it down! The plot was engrossing from the first to the last page. Highly recommend this book.
076781326X|1.0|It was not the version I thought. It had too much singing. The  story line was the same but too musical.
B000QK90CI|5.0|For all of us 'mature' people this movie brings back many memories and explains different aspects of the motorcycle industry.  People we know are in it, Steve Mcqueen, Malcolm Smith, Mert Lawill, Kenny Pressgrove from Kansas and more. Make sure you have this movie in your library and keep it handy to review with your friends. They've been showing this movie over and over at motorcycle events for years. Enjoy
B00AHSINKO|4.0|It was a fun movie. Reminded my wife and I of our own issues. Good laughs throughout. The personalities were fun.
075669812X|5.0|again, recommended by my son for his boys.  It is the kind you just sit and look at over and over...what a good choice for active boys!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Johnny Depp has done better. Could be the theme of the movie, but it was mildly comical and somewhat boring at times.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|Bought for 4 year old grandson who has an eight year old brother who is Whiz with legos and helped him get this together over a weekend.  Better than expected and lots of fun time after it was put together
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|No where close to the original series. The plot was a feeble attempt to play off the original series. Failed miserably.
030758836X|4.0|AN IMPRESSIVE STORY.  A BIT DISTURBING BUT THOUGHT PROVOKING.  LOVE, MARRIAGE, CHARACTER FLAWS AND INTRIGUE.  HARD TO PUT THIS ONE DOWN.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Well the game starts out easy to get you used to the game but man it gets addictive and difficult as you progress. I'm glad I got it and for free. I would have paid for this game
B000FCK65W|3.0|It's a slow read for me so far. I'm not finished reading it yet. But I'm curious to know what the hoopla is all about
B00992CF6W|5.0|you get to build and battle huge mobs of zombies and every thing. also get to vs creepers but don't get to close or else. kabooom you almost dead
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|This movie is wonderful. The delivery was fast and everything was intact when it was delivered. I'm very happy with my purchase. The price was good as well.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I like this as much as anything SD/DF has ever released. I enjoy each release as a unique masterpiece, although The Royal Scam occupies a special place in my head. Maybe because it got me hooked in 76. I had that \\"disco sucks\\" mentality back then, but that suspiciously disco-sounding Fez groove got under my skin. Listening to the Dan opened me up to all kinds of music.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|First got the app for my 4year old son who loves the show. But then I got hooked playing and won't let him have a turn. It's very true to the show. Just dislike that I need to buy jems in order to get certain ponies that I need for the game. But I still enjoy playing it!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is fun to play the grandkids have fun with it and it is free good fun for all enjoy.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|I'd really give this 4.5 stars rather than five.  It's not a PERFECT book.  But for what it is, it comes really damn close.
B0091QS88K|5.0|You can make stuff and it has great graphics. Entertaining too. It even has customers that are nice. Great game.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Don't use this however my grandson was the one that downloaded it. He surfs youtube more than I do. So I really can't rate it other than what I have heard him say about it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|you have to pay for more of the fun of the game. Sorta lame. If it's free, it should be free.
B0086700CM|3.0|I don't play this game on my Kindle I downloaded it for my grand children and they seem to like it. I will say it isn't played very often.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Read when in highschool.  Love revisiting the classic reads. Fabulous  with a glass of wine in front of the fireplace.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This was an excellent read. I purchased all 3 books written by this author and would recommend them to readers. No problem downloading it just took seconds.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|It was just to silly for us.  There are better movies he has done and many better to watch. Silly.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I didn't fall asleep while watching this movie.  That means it's a pretty good movie.  I def recommend it, even late at night.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Clint  Eastwood has always been a favorite.  He is still &#34;the man&#34;. Clint Eastwood is still the favorite of many households..Great movie
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a fun game to pass some time playing. Easy, decent graphics, your energy refills pretty quickly. Worth giving it a try.
B00000J048|5.0|I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. He gets lots of the same type of toy so I was glad to find something that would help him use his brain too. This is made very well and my three year old picked up the concept quickly. You could even buy more than one set for extended building. I love this type of toy.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|What a wonderful story with a very unexpected event with all the disturbing friction between the Queen and her daughter. A great movie for the whole family !
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is so beautifully written. And such a touching story written with so much feeling. Loved the main character, she was so real.<br />Would reccommend this book to all of my friends and anyone who enjoys a good read
B005LAII0S|5.0|The Grimm Brothers would have been proud of this version due to the comedy and quirky banter the movie gives.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game! it's better than the real games! this is the perfect distraction for those boring long wait times we all experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I did not get a chance to read the Amazon reviews before reading. I can see why so many people love this book and I also understand why others were somewhat uncomfortable with the subject matter; it is not for the faint of heart, but it is real and I am glad that authors are addressing it.<br /><br />The story begins as a seventeen year old girl named Sky begins her first year in public school after her mother home schooled her since she was young. It is expected that, as her best friend moves away and she begins life in an unfamiliar setting, her life will change. Sky meets Holder and soon high school life isn't as unsettling as it seemed when she started. Despite this, Sky faces many obstacles and even must face herself.<br /><br />The premise is simple and if you have read a million other YA books you might not see the draw in this plot. I recommend that you read this book before you read any of the others. The author allows you to explore the plot and her characters in a depth left untouched by other authors of the genre. Sky and Holder are extremely likeable characters and you love them, even at their worst.
1419702238|5.0|i got this for my son who has the rest of the set. he hasnt read it yet but im sure he will like it also.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|This movie is hilarious<br />I thought it was not that bad. I like it. I would recommend it to younglings.
1419701533|5.0|the box set is very neat. my son enjoys these books very much and has convinced me that i should read them too!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|i really liked this game. i especially the fact that you can draw your own characters. fun little time killer.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|michael buble never disappoints you. i love his voice and his choice of songs. great christmas cd sorry the season is over
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I started to read just to read anything and got hooked. I've read more &#34;steamy&#34; book for the background of how this book came to be, love it!
145210655X|5.0|My son grew up as a HUGE Star Wars fan and now has a son of his own, so I bought this book for his upcoming birthday and can't wait to hear back from him after he's opened the gift!  I loved reading the book and looking at the illustrations.  It's the perfect mix of Star Wars and parenting that anyone from that era will love.
B00012BSHG|5.0|My son loved it! it did its job. Its not fancy or anything but simple and did the job! thanks
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|If you love E.T. you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I was put off reading this series because of the vampire theme due to the bloody nature of most vampire movies/books. This series however is a love story between a human teenager and a forever 17 year old vampire. These books are more interesting than the movies since movies depend on sight and books depend on descriptive detail to set the scene. Plus screen writers use parts of the action out of sequence and sometimes scenes not included when compared to the books. Would I recommend the books, certainly. The first book, Twlight, was simplisticly written for a younger reader and almost put me off reading the rest of the series. Don't let this happen. Go on reading, the books are better written as the story unfolds.  This last book is WOW.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|If you love scary movies you should buy this and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
0792839749|5.0|It arrived quickly and in New Condition.<br />Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a classic and the kids loved it!<br />Definitely for young adults as it tends to be slow moving at times.
B009MF56GC|5.0|If you love killing you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B0058VA2TU|5.0|This album sounds absolutely amazing on vinyl. The album is one of Anthrax's best in years.<br />Was thrilled when it was released on vinyl.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|If you love Batman you should buy these movies and if you already own them on DVD then buy them again anyways.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|It doesn't get better than this. So funny and yet so damn serious! MK's experience and research have made this book a total favourite.
B00319ECGU|5.0|If you love Dirty Harry you should buy this and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book brings pre-existing concepts into the mainstream and presents it in an accessible format. I've personally found it very effective.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|If you love Kate Beckinsale you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I'd love to see more of this kind of thing, particularly in the mainstream. I would also love to know more about the physiology of personality type (wouldn't we all).
B001EOQWF8|5.0|If you love Disney you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All three movies one great price. No frills just all three titles in HD, ultra violet digital copy and book with screen shots.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you love The Avengers you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it! It saves the totals even when I close the app! It is good because I already know all of the calorie counts so I just add it on and close the app! At the end of the day I clear it out and it is ready to go tomorrow!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|If you love action movies you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B009E3EY38|5.0|My husband received this as a gift for Christmas this year. He is very Happy with it and has watched it several times already.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|If you love Transformers you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
0780619951|5.0|I am a hard core horror and sc-fi man!!!  I have watched the good, the bad, and the UGLY!!!  Generally remakes leave you a little flat, i.e. Amytiville Horror!!!!  UGGGHH!!!  This was an awesome remake.  It actually goes further and was quite a bit different.  I bought the original and this at the same time and very good time.  Almost like 2 different movies with the similarity of basic, just basic plot.  Gene splicing and making mutants are always a number 1 draw, but then throw in the slashing mutants and no way off the island, you get a nice entertaining time.  I am not going to spoil you with a synopsis any larger than my hints above.  You will just love this movie, especially with the grade A actors and actresses.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you love HD you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Brilliant Piece of art work!!!  Best Batman I've seen in years.  They did Frank Miller justice.  If you don't like it then you're a communist!!!
B005LAIIS0|5.0|If you love Liam Neeson you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B001K98MFU|5.0|This movie contains some of the greatest animation scenes I have ever viewed.  What a fantastic piece.  I'm really happy with this purchase.
B001FB55M6|5.0|If you love Jim Carrey you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved  reading this book. It kept my attention. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Hope it could be a movie.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|If you love Batman you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
B000J5XS3C|2.0|Well, it works, theres not much about it, I choose it because of the price, but wish that I had gotten something else.  it does save me from having to reach down on the floor where the computer is located to pull the speaker cables out when its time to record.  When I hook the speakers to this unit however, its not such a great sound quality.
0765325950|1.0|Not releasing this book for kindle is so blatantly manipulative and greedy that I suspect it will backfire.  I have never reviewed a book before but I hope that the aggregate anger of the WOT fan-base makes them think twice before pulling off this stunt again.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Friends told me about this series as their favorite author's character&#34;Reacher&#34;. Start these stores in sequence. I am on the third book, &#34;Trip Wire&#34;,- my favorite so far.Though all books seem to follow similar plots, he throws enough changesin  to make them all interesting. Child is the King of fast action writing.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great scripts & acting & I'm only on episode 2, season 1. Looking forward to more! I had heard good things about this series, but am not an HBO subscriber so hadn't seen it when it first came out.
B0015GDVTU|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie it makes me laugh, cry and makes me believe in true love.  I think everyone who has every loved someone should watch it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed all of these books. I felt the hype of these being such sexually provocative books to be a hype. They talked about their sexual relationship yet it wasn't as crazy as everyone made it out to be.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good read!  I finished in 3 days. Didn't want to put it down. Nicholas sparks is great. Can't wait for the movie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book. Lots of parts are not portrayed in the movie so it was an excellent read.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Very e tertaining, it is a movie the whole family can enjoy and be entertain. I have seen the ither movies of same title and I must say this was even better or maybe the best if the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this down. It started off quickly and kept you guessing until the end. I really enjoyed reading this book!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good book!  I couldn't put it down. This was the first book that I have read by this author,  I will definitely look for more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read it for the story. It is fabulous. It does explain their sex life in detail. The story the couples goes through is interesting and I enjoyed the read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its soooo fun the filling up the board makes it harder but other than that this game is funcational  fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very relaxing game.  I play it several times a week to unwind after working all day.  It also helps keep my brain from getting lazy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful story line as are all of his books! Can't wait to start on the next one tomorrow. Everyone enjoy!
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I was so happy to find that she had put all of her hits onto one album! Great album for Katy Perry fans!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Such an amazing book! Definitely makes you stop and realize how much you have to be thankful that you take for granted. I am going to try to remember each day a quote from Jaycee, \\"If you only have one person to love, that is enough.\\" Everyone should read this!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This is a great album! If you love the other album you will surely love this one too! I highly recommend it!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This concert is way better then going to a real one, besides you can pause it and continue without skipping a beat!  The quality of the DVD is superb and the audio paired with a good surround system really does it justice.  Amazon delivers well with price quality and performance, very happy with DVD!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|If you love the Black Keys or an artist similar I highly recommend this album! I can't stop listening to it!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Alot of people have been talking about this release and now I see why, what an awesome package put together,  so far the audio is amazing, paired with a good music system is as if I'm there in front row!  Thank you amazon and led zeppelin!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|After seeing the film I knew this soundtrack was a must have! The vocals from the cast are great and Anna Kendrick makes a stellar musical debut! I highly recommend this soundtrack if you love movie musicals!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game clear States how many games are avaliable to play and you can play them all once you earn them all. meaning just like a game with multiple levels can play level two without beating level one. the more you play the more you earn the more games become avaliable.
0060924160|4.0|If you want to understand how men think and how women think this is the book.  It will help most relationships become stronger.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Chick flick.  My teenage daughters love this movie.  I have seen it twice with them and get a kick out of it...and it gave us the perfect excuse to re-watch the Breakfast Club!  Entertaining.
0743486285|5.0|The book is a great look into the mind of an addict.  This could be anyone with any addiction.  Nikki Sixx opens up his closet of demons for all to read, it's like birthcontrol for drug use.
0765331152|1.0|I would have pre ordered or bought the ebook version on release day.  Since im not done rereading the series, i will just wait a couple of weeks and buy a used hardback copy and save a few bucks and not give my money to TOR direct.
0316228532|4.0|Like most readers, I pre-ordered this book simply because of my longterm love affair with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. I had heard the mixed reader and critic reviews before I even started it and I kept an open mind going into it and I urge anyone who hasn't read it to do the same thing!<br /><br />I started out on the wrong foot with this book because I made the mistake of brining it to Hawaii with me. The book's beginning is not one that grabs you right away. I had a hard time getting into it because of the frequent character shift, but by the end I found the story couldn't have been told any other way. It is absolutely heartbreaking and although it takes a while to get into, it will stay with you for a long time after. I was resently talking with a friend and she made the comment she hadn't read anything good since.... and she came up with, The Casual Vacancy, and I agreed. It has grown on me even more since I read it. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The further into the book I got,(at least with one character's perspective) I found myself imagining it as a film adaption and kept coming up with comparisons to Andrea Arnold's \\"Fish Tank.\\" If you enjoyed this book, check out that movie and see if you find yourself in the same mindset when it comes the the character, Chrystal.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a great book that I picked up on a whim.  It was really fast moving and exciting and it was hard to put down!  Highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I bought and read this book firstly because Amazon recommended it, and secondly because of it's great reviews. That being said, I think it was overly hyped and I was set up to be disapointed. The book reads like an over imaginitive fan fiction. I would compare it's writing style to 50 shades but minus the smut. The plot is set up on a basic level that you can guess the outcome early on, and then continues to take expected over the top turns. Overall okay read for the price, but the material was not up to par with the reviews for me. Don't expect much.
B007N85ZXY|3.0|OK, right off, I'm a Neil Young fan. I like and own everything I can get my hands on by him or that involved him. I like him solo, with CS&N, with the Horse. I like him when he goes country and I like him when he goes bone-crunching high-volume rock and roll. There are days when I play 6, 10, or more of his records back to back. I've even watched Human Highway all the way through like 3 times! Well, maybe twice.<br /><br />Now for this particular release:<br /><br />This CD was given to me by a friend who got it free at a Neil Young concert he attended this past summer (2012) in Albuquerque, NM. He sent it to me and after hearing it I knew why he didn't keep it.<br /><br />It doesn't bear repeated listening.<br /><br />It isn't like it is poorly produced or that the music isn't stupendous; it's just the songs themselves are not going to make it into anybody's heavy listening list. A very small group may have that \\"can't get enough\\" sensation from this release, but I have to believe emphasis is on 'small group'. This release WILL be of interest to those Young fans that appreciate all aspects and nuances of an artist's work and are capable of appreciating this for what it is. If you grew up in the US and are within +/- 20 years of Young's age, you have heard these numbers, most of them anyway, a multitude of times, especially during early school years. For me, it's hard to remove them from that context and maybe therein lays my lukewarm feeling toward this piece. Yes, the songs ARE truly Americana as the title implies and I have to admit I have never heard those time-worn old tunes performed quite that way. My toe also commenced a-tappin' several times...<br /><br />After it was over (and I listened to it over a very nice audio system) I could see no practical reason why I would ever need to hear it again. Maybe if during some abstract intoxicating substances fueled conversation something like \\"Oh Susannah\\" or \\"Clemintine\\" came up where I could say \\"Have you ever heard Neil Young doing...\\" then I could see me whipping it out to blast a track.<br /><br />It's a shame because a couple of the covers he does are not eye-rolling trite like the majority are. Those would have been better served as bonus track or extras on more standard issue fare.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />-If you are a hard core Young fan, you need this in your collection. It doesn't matter how good/bad it is. It's Neil and Crazy Horse dammit!<br /><br />-If you are a casual Young fan and regardless of if you like country Neil or Rockin' Neil, you will likely tire of this really quick unless  you selectively lift a few of the worthy tunes to your personal music device, whatever that may be.<br /><br />-If you are a collector of non-standard work from well known performers and can focus on the uniqueness of artist/material you may enjoy this.<br /><br />With me, I'm just happy to have it to add to the collection and happy it didn't cost me anything, but will likely never listen to it again.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|We actually went and watched this movie in the Theater. After seeing this movie we kept talking about it and singing some of the songs so we decided we just had to watch it again. We have watched it probably 5 times now and absolutely love it. It is full of funny one liners, great music/singing.<br />I would recommend it
0765325950|1.0|Very disappointed there is no ebook.  No reason could possibly be accepted.  20+ years of loyalty apparently don't mean much.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|The movie was o.k, but not fantastic. It just didn't have anything that was memorable or fantastic about it. Chalk it up to I watched it, not the best and not the worse.If you watch it I hope you enjoy it .
B000PDYVVG|5.0|She honestly shares her deep emotional states with the reader, raising my great sympathy and empathy. I've learned a lot from the detailed descriptions she made during her one-year trip.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We watch this movie every year. This is a Christmas &#34;have to watch&#34; . It is probably the best movie that Will Farrell has done<br /> ( my opinion only). Highly recommend
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read alot of books, and not all romance novels either. I was forced to read the Fifty Shades Trilogy by a friend, and I love her so much for it! The third installment was a good read, with all the kinkiness I was expecting ;)
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|4 stars on the movie.  Not sure what the HD provided via Amazon.  Picture quality was good, but audio was not HD.
B00867GK26|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites. Watching it on bluray has just enhanced my viewing experience. They did a fantastic job with it!
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|its a great movie to watch it has many famous actors in it and female actors and singers just enjoy it
0062060562|3.0|Definitely an interesting premise in this one, but flawed in execution.<br /><br />The pacing is a bit odd -- a bit \\"stop-start-stop-start\\" -- perhaps due to the intermittent repetition of earlier events. That's to be expected somewhat, given the nature of the subject. But it starts to grate on the nerves a little when the amnesiac protagonist, Christine, goes back and mulls over prior events for the nth time and only *then* comes to certain realizations (or considers alternate interpretations of those events) that already occurred to the reader 40 pages ago.<br /><br />The problem is that Christine's world is very, very small. There are very few players, very few locations, and very few key events. In the end, there are only so many combinations of those, and only so many permutations of possible explanations. And while Christine's struggle is linking day to day and dealing with issues of trust and faith (even in herself), the reader will typically work through the process of eliminating those permutations far faster than Christine does -- meaning that, by the time the denouement finally arrives, the \\"thrilling\\" ending is (depending on how cynical you are) either predictable or, at the very least, a possibility that already crossed your mind some time in the last 200 pages. It's more of a, \\"Ah, so it was explanation (c) after all,\\" ending rather than, \\"Oh my God, I would never have imagined that!\\"<br /><br />Of course, the crux is that the persistent repetition, permeating self-doubt and paranoia, and repeated analysis and reinterpretation of events are meant to give us an emotional bond with Christine in her fragile state. Unfortunately I just didn't feel that -- although I could feel that it's what the author was trying to achieve. Empathetic involvement with the central character is obviously critical in a story like this, and sadly the lack of it kind of killed any \\"thrill\\" for me.<br /><br />Still, the story was interesting, had some nice ideas (if occasionally messy in the telling) ... and I can actually see it being condensed into a decent movie thriller. In fact it may even work better in that format, since the protagonist's own thoughts won't be so clearly illustrated to the viewer, which was part of the downfall of the novel in my eyes.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />One thing I have to write about, though, which irked me ALL the way through the book:<br /><br />The author is English. The protagonist is English. The entire story takes place in London, England and never ventures outside the country or even involved foreigners.<br /><br />So why the *persistent* Americanisms throughout the book?? As an expat Brit living in the US, they were particularly glaring and distracting to me. Each time I came across a new one, it dropped me completely out of any involvement in the story.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />- \\"And there's a cell phone...\\"  -- Not cell phone. Mobile phone in Britain.<br /><br />- \\"We don't know if you were crossing the street at the time or if the car that hit you mounted the sidewalk, but either way you must have gone over the hood.\\"  -- Wow. Triple-whammy here. Street/sidewalk/hood??  Road/pavement/bonnet. Glaringly, glaringly awful Americanization of the text. Exactly zero chance of ever hearing this sentence uttered anywhere in Britain.<br /><br />- \\"It was Guy Fawkes night this week.\\"  -- A Brit would just call it \\"bonfire night\\". Nobody would ever call it \\"Guy Fawkes night\\".<br /><br />- \\"... clutching bags of candy or potato chips.\\" -- Bags of sweets. Crisps. This sentence would distract and irritate any Brit.<br /><br />- \\"I'll go and get a Band-Aid.\\"  -- Plaster.<br /><br />- Various references to \\"soccer\\", \\"garbage pails\\" and \\"asphalt\\" (rather than tarmac) ... none of which would turn up in Brit-speak either.<br /><br />So I'm curious: Is this Americanization of the text peculiar to the US edition? Because surely a British author wouldn't have butchered his own text in such a way... would he?<br /><br />So a note to the US editors: Stop trying to dumb down the text for an American audience.<br /><br />Your audience isn't actually that dumb and it only detracts from the authenticity of the story (and distracts any Brits reading the US edition). It's not like you're translating from Mandarin; the British and American English languages and cultures are pretty similar, and I'm sure the readers can work it out themselves.
B00005JLR2|5.0|yes it another movie i like as a kid and still do its a good movie and the whole family can watch
0307341550|5.0|I am a huge fan of Gillian Flynn, even more so now. This was my second novel by her and my admiration for her writing grows with each read. This book did not fail me. I liked the cast of characters and each ones role. I saw a review that said 'far fetched' and beg to differ. Look into small town life in the south. Look into the disease the mother had and follow the lines of demise that can create in a family. I won't say more for those who have not read it. Except, it's believable. All in one town, one family? Maybe, maybe not, but this is fiction people. It's meant to sweep you away. You want the real stories of these tragidies, read the tell all books that account the non-fiction, real life, people these novels are based upon. You want a good read to sweep you up and make your hair stand up? Read this.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love all of his books and have read almost all of them to date. It holds my interest at all times and I hate to put it down once I start.
0765325950|1.0|It's absurd that this last book has been released today and most of the fans won't be able to read it for 4 months.  Do the publishers think it's still 1980?  Who reads a hard book anymore?  Probably the three people who bought the physical book.<br /><br />Hey!  It's 2013, get with the times.  I'm one of many disappointed fans.  Robert Jordan is rolling in his grave knowing his work has been sold out to make money by alienating his fans.  Sanderson, little help please?
0307987698|3.0|I bought this to be a gift, and I was slightly disappointed by the condition of the cover. There was fraying, fading, and the remnants of a yellow sticker. Otherwise, the inside of the book was in good condition, and it arrived within the expected time frame.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I had learned the basic moves in chess, but I had always been reluctant to play the game with someone, I knew that I wasn't that good. Now, I am playing and learning at the same time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love that I can see the weather forecast and that I can set the alarm to go off on certain days. It is easy to use and you can alter the snooze time, volume, and alarm sounds. Even better because it's free!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Hate those stupid pop-up ads. I don't get those with Solitaire on my PC. Hard to relax having to click out of the ad with every deal.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins will instantly get you hooked on her magnificent sequel to The Hunger Games. Between the romance, drama, and exciting twists and turns, I could not put this book down. If you have read the first book and are looking for more I strongly suggest you read Catching Fire!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was sabotaged from the moment it aired.  It's episodes were shown out of order!!!!!!!!!  (Someone had an agenda).  Firefly is a well-written series with extremely high production values and excellent acting.  Fans of quality science fiction, like Babylon 5, will enjoy it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was truly the best series I have ever read. I just wish Bella`s vampire life will be extended further. A great read for all ages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a really life book. With really things that happen in people's lives. I loved this book. It made me laugh and cry but it was real. This is a must read book for anyone. The author she did an amazing job with going back and forth between past and present. It was truly a great book!!
B0043JDUNS|3.0|too much going on and not enough action in the sequel. Iron man was made to look like a doofus.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is juvenile or great for people that live unimaginative sex lives. For me...boring. Sad that I purchased the trilogy.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I heard one of the songs by Imagine Dragons and really liked it, and bought the cd.  I like most of the music on the album.  Worth the purchase.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Love it once I was tshown how it was to be played I find myself playing and competing against my time. I love how it activates the brain cells in a fun way
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Like the story line. LOVED the creepy ambience. I would play more games made by this company. Can't wait to see what else they have.

030758836X|5.0|Nick Dunne seems to be about as despicable as you can get, and now there's a big cloud of suspicion hanging over him, as his wife Amy has gone missing on their fifth anniversary.  Their marriage is on the rocks, especially after having relocated from NYC to Nick's Missouri hometown, and Nick doesn't have an alibi for the morning of Amy's disappearance.  The media are documenting his every smirk as evidence that he must have wanted to get rid of his wife.  He readily admits to the reader that he's lying about his whereabouts on the morning in question and about the argument the neighbors overheard the night before.  He's also not sharing with the cops the solutions to all the riddles Amy has left behind in her annual treasure hunt.  Amy, on the other hand, is the inspiration for her parents' wildly successful children's book series, Amazing Amy.  You'll have to reserve judgment about Amy until the second half of the book, but the manner in which the author presents the facts surrounding Amy's disappearance is just brilliant.  The first half of the book sets the stage, alternating between Nick's story and Amy's diary, but your jaw will drop as the plot unfolds in the second half, completely reshuffling the deck.  There are plenty of other shady characters that could have offed Amy, but their stories get rewound as well.  This is not your typical thriller, and there's no one here to carry the standard for truth, justice and the American way.  It's creepy and twisty, yet easy to follow, but the really mind-blowing way in which the author draws and then redraws the characters is what makes this book such a hit.
0345803485|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  I read it through 4 times.  Besides its very racey bits, I enjoyed the banter between the two main characters Christian and Anastasia. The happiness of these two characters was hard won by struggling through their insecurities. I thought the series was very well written and it was wrapped up with a more than just a promise of a future for a tormented soul.<br /><br />Fifty Shades got me hooked on the erotic romance genre.  It has been used as a basis for comparison to other stories such as Crossfire series which I loved even more.
0307346617|5.0|I had been very hesitant to read this book for quite some time, even though I had received the The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead as a Christmas Gift some time ago: I was worried that it would be too zombie-ish and excessively technical in some ridiculous way. On top of that, anybody I knew who had already read the book and suggested it to me was often a little too much of a geek/nerd/dork/whatever-you-want-to-call-it for me.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong! Instead of being a wet-dream for Zombie fanatics, this is a fantastic series of short stories and vignettes of the experiences of ordinary (and not-so-ordinary) people experiencing the worst nightmare imaginable: a world-wide outbreak of a zombie virus. The tales of their harrowing experiences, their survival, their horror, their sorrow and dread, all make for such a captivating read that you begin to forget that the main antagonist of the book (beyond the still-living humans) is a zombie (or, to put it more accurately, hundreds of millions of zombies).<br /><br />This is a great book for lovers of Sci-Fi, short stories, and zombie flicks (and especially if you have enjoyed &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;).
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This reminds me of 100 Floors.  I really enjoy this game.  Can be very challenging.  Looking forward to more levels!

B009IQ0TGM|4.0|What can I say... Ellie is brilliant. Even though this album feels like a complete departure from &#34;Lights,&#34; it is still genius. Very ethereal, moody, and intoxicating. I have to admit, the album overall is a bit somber for my taste. I loved some of the more upbeat songs from &#34;Lights&#34; and you won't find many of those on Halcyon. But when she gets it right on Anything Could Happen, My Blood, and Figure 8? Perfection. She is a creative force and a true artist. True Ellie fans will appreciate at least parts of this album, even if not the whole thing.
B008OOYALE|1.0|never downloaded to my kindle never got to try app - have no idea if it works - would like to try it - but not there
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think the game works great and I have had no problems playing the game. I would recommend this game for solitaire lover's.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is very entertaining amazing imagery and loads of fun! I really want to see it all the way through!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Absolutely one of the best series....Whitfield is amazing....he is greatly missed in the next seasons. R.I.P.<br />McIntyre is a perfect replacement.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wonderful read for any fantasy enthusiast. Especially enjoyed the use of dragons in the story. I look forward to the next book.
0930289234|1.0|I ws hoping this would be actual literature: good plot, amazing characters, decent dialogue...well, the graphics were okay, but the rest left me astonished that a publisher went for it. What do I know? I'm a published author, but I'm over 60, so maybe that's the problem. I sent it back to a distributor and prayed for my money back.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Unusually raw and violent. The characters and performances do not stand out. Guy Pearce is the exception. Not for the faint of heart.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I enjoy playing it.  It has many different set ups.  All ages will enjoy playing it. The graphis are great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I rated it a 5 because I really enjoy playing this game. It helps to keep my mind active. I would recommend it to anyone - any age.
B006O6F932|3.0|My daughter received this for Christmas, she was soooo excited to build this and start playing. It was easy to put together and came with fun accessories. I was dissapointed in the quality as it is flimsy. The stairs don't stay in place and she has to lean it up against a wall to hold it up. Not sure if I would recommend this product, however it makes my daughter happy and she plays with it constantly.
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|I also bought this one on CD because I had it on cassette and loved it. I don't play cassettes really anymore, plus can't find the cassette.
B0038P59A0|5.0|It's just a good movie and amazon was having an awesome sale, so I went for it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who like mysteries.
B000002GB9|5.0|I had this album on cassette years ago and loved it. I wanted it on CD because I really don't listen to cassettes anymore, plus I can't find it.
B008KYDUYG|5.0|Bought as a gift and she loved it and  has played for weeks now, So if you have  a fan its a good investment
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I love being able to set my alarm on my kindle fire...it's really cool tobe able to listen to pandora

B009IA9OLE|5.0|I bought this game when it was on sale for $1and it was the best $1 I ever spent. This game is definitely worth $3. I am totally addicted. I told my daughter about it &amp; my husband plays it too. We love it. The graphics are great on the kindle fire and the witty comments between lawyers is very amusing. I absolutely love this game. Please please please make more games like this. They are so entertaining. Great game!!! You won't be disappointed, honestly.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I am mildly obsessed with this movie. There are so many great one-liners, a great ensemble cast, & it's not full of profanity & sex. Destined to be a cult classic.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book, I never wanted to put it down.  I was always wondering what was going to happen next.  I can't wait to start the next book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great ap! I love it. Especially nice for bed time and I like that you can set the timer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Make this your next<br />Read for sure! It will be your favorite book by far. Love this author, moving on to another of her books.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|I am a fan of the Total War franchise and this app for a mobile device knocks it right out of the park! If you like war games get this one
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Lana del Rey. What is there to say about this girl. This album lived up to my expectations of her, although her first album is definitely better.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Not going to spoil it.  Was fun to watch.  Glad it wasnt a replacement of jason bourne Im not fond of remakes.. rarely does remakes ever work.. with rare exceptions.  This was fun to watch if you into conspiracies and secret organizations.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I was excited about this version on Kindle,but I became dissatified with the navigation . It is very cumbersome and slow.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This one is what i expected of green arrow.  Though so far im hoping for more change and developement in the character.  I liked smallville how the character developed.  Though so far its doesnt have too much development toward the character.  So I gave it a 4 star.  Hoping the character developes a bit more as the story goes otherwise the story goes stagnet.  Where its a numerous stories but no change to the character starts to bore me.
B000093OUA|5.0|One of the greatest guitarists who ever lived is down right awesome! A must have for any Gary Moore fan! A must have if your a guitarist and a fan of sweet tone!! All killer no filler. Recommended!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I saw that this movie had potential.  Sadly tim burton got a hold of it and make it a sad joke.  I was so disappointed.  Like Johnny dep but this was bad.  ugh...  this show was made to be melodrama, little humor sure would be ok.  But tim burton is pretty much a joke and shouldnt be doing movies if he is going to cause a show that wasnt made for joking with.  Thats what spoof movies are for.  He made this into a spoof and thats not what this was supposed to be.  Oh that guy needs to do something else.  Bad judgment on this movie and someone I talked to expected it to be bad cause of Tim Burton.  Owell...
B00000J2SP|5.0|Joe Lynn Turner takes over for Gramm Bonnet.A very good album.From this album on,they only get better!I recommend this cd!
0345803493|5.0|I truely enjoyed this book. What a wonderful author. The perfect love story leaves you reeling for more. What a eye opening story to a different world.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|A great classic heep album,but the supposed remastering is terrible! I play my music loud.This has to be played louder than loud.I recommend you buy the domestic version . Same or better quality,half the price!!
B000G6R7B8|5.0|At it's price it had everything I was looking for in a watch.  Seiko Hardlex window is more scratch resistant than the mineral dial windows used in comparable watches.  Fairly accurate automatic movement and solid bezel are also great.  If you like exhibition case backs it's got that too.  Will stop running if you don't wear it for a day so if you don't want to wear it everyday and don't like to set a watch before you head out then maybe a quartz battery powered watch or a Citizen Eco Drive might be more up your alley.<br /><br />All in all it's a cool watch, have received many compliments... (mostly from other men)
B0000630YA|5.0|This will always be one of my most favorite Cooper albums.From start to finish this concept album if you will is all killer no filler! Recommended!
0740748475|5.0|My review is more of the binding which was my primary concern when buying this collection.  I received the 9th printing of the book (October 2012) and the binding looks solid.  The binding is stitched and no longer glued(First Printing?).  I haven't found any defects in the books yet, will update if there are any.<br /><br />Paper quality looks and feels solid.  Colors are all nice, etc.  Books are very heavy, you might want to consider the paperback collection if it's for a child.  It feels like this collection should withstand the test of time with proper care.
B00000J2SQ|5.0|Rainbow just keeps getting better when this was realeased.Very radio friendly.Classic Blackmore sound. Simply love it.Although I'm more a fan of the Dio version of Rainbow, I recommend it very much!
B0060MYM7O|2.0|great movies but it take HBO to long to release it to blue ray.  In fact i still do not have it I had to get HBO to watch it
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Very true. After reading &#34;The Secret&#34; this book was recommended to me. It's a great addition to &#34;The Secret&#34; and really helps to get into the depth of it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This review is coming from someone who has not yet finished the first book and has not seen the hbo series.<br /><br /> I am almost done with the first book, and all I can say is, it's one of the few books that you want to stop sleeping and going to work to read.  (Or read it at work anyway like me.) The story is known to make it so once you get attached to a character, they wrench at your heart strings.  Don't get attached to anyone.  The characters are so well done that you feel as if they're real. Martin has a way of throwing you into the story ever so much and then throwing you into a different (and just as good) part of it only to leave you wanting to keep reading just to get back to the other part, but at the same time making whatever scene he sends you to next better than the last.<br /><br />Read the first five pages and you'll buy the whole series, trust me. Oh, and read the books before watching the series.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|First time someone introduced the book to me I was interested but didn't read it. This was a few years ago. Finally I read it and I can only say everything happens for a reason!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|It's a hands down that it just isn't worth the small savings purchasing a standard DVD when a Bluray version of any given movie exists!

B007THA4FI|4.0|As a rabid fan of JK's HP series and all things Potterworld, I was most curious to read her 1st adult novel.  For my taste it didn't hold the reader's rapt attention in quite the same way and I actually felt it was embarrassingly too adult in places - it just felt wrong to hear that kind of foul language uttered by Rowling!  The plot was also very slow to develop and the twists were a bit too predictable.  I did enjoy the feeling that it was written for a distinctly British audience, requiring me to look up various slang terms & brand names - it was very much like being immersed in the English lifestyle even more so than we had been with HP Wizarding World.  My impression is JK perhaps was not as committed to this effort of one book as she had been to her previous series of 7, but it was definitely an interesting read.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|Because the movie was a Blu-ray and it had all the upgrades from the standard DVD and huge upgrades from the older VHS tapes; &#34;The movie picture and sound was Grrrrrrrreat!!!! Their speedy service was awesome and as such, I hope to purchase more from them in the future too!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this game!!<br />It's very easy to play &amp; so much fun!! I recommend it for all. That's all Folks!!!

B00338QENI|5.0|A must read to all!  This amazing non-fiction reads a novel, but with all the interesting parts of real life.  We all used HeLa cells in our lives, and interestingly so, it came from a humble woman.

B006WXHJVC|5.0|Because the movie was a Blu-ray and it had all the upgrades from the standard DVD and huge upgrades from the older VHS tapes; &#34;The movie picture and sound was Grrrrrrrreat!!!! Their speedy service was awesome and as such, I hope to purchase more from them in the future too!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|this game is addicting!<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a challenge and can think fast on their feet.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|it wasn't really all that funny, the best parts were shown in the ads, I wasn't that impressed with the movie
B000059ZT4|5.0|It goes without saying that the name and likeness of Bob Marley instantly brings to mind the word &#34;Legend&#34;.  And there is obviously good reason for that once you start to learn about his music.  but i won't get into that, cause i can't do it as much justice as others already have...  I can say this, purchase this album.  This Deluxe Edition comes with both the US and Jamaican recordings of the same songs which both are fantastic.  The wealth of soul and warmth on this album is incredible.  The first song on the Album is Concrete Jungle which for some reason gives me goose bumps when i put it on.  I think the real highlight of this collection are the Jamaican recordings.  They are a little more stripped down to the core elements of the songs, and in this case less is a little more.  I am so glad that I picked this album up.  It will be in my collection till the day i die.  If that's not a recommendation, i don't know what is.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I played this game on an I-phone one tech had at a video store. Small hook. Then I got a download to my laptop. Medium hook. Now I have it on my android tablet. Big fat honking hook! I could play this game for days, er, have been playing for days. Great stress reliever.
B0080R3YIU|5.0|I got this book as a recommendation from a very good friend of mine.  It's simply a beautiful introduction to Tao philosophies in the form of Pooh.  Each character and explanation flows very well and is quite a joy to read.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Just finished the first chapter, but already addicted to the show and book!  Will probably finish it by the end of the week.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I bought this as a gift and was thoroughly impressed with the energy in this film.  It does a great job of capturing what the guys are about and how well they try to bring the entire audience into a collective performance.  If you are a Coldplay fan, this is an absolute must.  If you &#34;kinda like that one song on the radio&#34; this will probably make you a fan.  Every minute of the film has something good to offer.  In general, the film is shot well and cut together fantastically.  It does a great job of embracing the intimacy of what is happening on stage while also tuning you in to the vibe of the audience.  And with this performance, Coldplay makes an extra effort to include everyone stadium wide where ever they went.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is the first app I loaded on my new Kindle fire and I was very pleased to get it.  I have only tried it a few times and while I like the convenience of taking it with me wherever I go, its a little hard to get used to the light touch that is required and the sometimes slow response time.  I do like the many configurations, but wish there were a choice of tiles.
B004XZR63M|4.0|An easy read and simple to understand. Ofc needs to be taken with a pinch of salt but enjoyable and provoked me to consider different aspects and options of my personal financial wellbeing
B003O86FMW|5.0|I originally just saw the movie and hadn't read the first book so I skipped over the first book with knowledge from the movie. It was still easy to follow, enjoyed from beginning to end. Can't wait to read book 3!

B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very sweet story. I love how Connor was so attentive and such a great husband from the very start. He is very protective of Megan as well right from the start, especially when it came to her passive aggressive friends. Though he is claiming &#34;loveless&#34; from the start, he is showing his love in everything he does. He no doubt upholds his vows. But sometimes a girl just needs to hear those three words.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is a great read.  Interest is imediate and just keeps on going.  I will look forward more David Baldacci novels.  Mystery readers will enjoy this book.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader is the standard used by nearly everyone now.  Of course, that could change in the future, but for now, any PDF document you want to read or save can be saved using Adobe Reader.  If you want edit capability, you need the full Adobe program, which is also the industry standard for PDF editing.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like the touch screen with this game.  Makes it go so much faster.  I enjoy it, but if you are looking for excitement, this is not the game for you.

1781161097|5.0|I bought this book for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. He is a big fan of the film and the rest of the Alien movies. Several family members were impressed with the book as well.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have been watching this series for awhile now, and I think it's awesome.  I have the entire collection at home and intend on buying Season 8 as soon as it is available on DVD.  There are some touchy issues in the series if you are a Christian.  I try to keep an open mind and realize that the program is fictional, not factual.
B0015AARJI|5.0|El control es muy bueno, lo recomiendo es completamente original, llegó en muy buenas condiciones. Para mí, el mejor control del mundo. Gracias a Sony.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I had to get a refund on this product. It does NOT fit the original sized Kindle Fire HD, which is what I needed it for.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The book starts out great but fizzles in the end.  Great build up to such a let down ending, like the author just gave up.
B005LAIGSC|1.0|My low rating here applies only to the quality of the BD, not the movie itself.  The movie is quite good, but the blu-ray video quality is the worst that I've seen (and that includes many re-releases on BD of vintage movies).  A newly produced and released movie like this should have breath-taking video quality, but NOT.  Bummer.  I have many DVDs with better pictures (higher definition) than this crappy release.

B000TEUSJK|5.0|old movie i wish they would remake the history of this movie. good condition. no parts were cut out. worth getting
0060765488|5.0|Overall, The Chronicles of Narnia is a very interesting book and I would recommend it to young readers who like fantasy stories. It has wonderful imagery and figurative language that makes a beautiful picture in your head. Also, the plot keeps you entertained, so you never put the book down. It's a quick read that you can finish in your spare time and you don't have to read all the books in the series to understand it. It can be a stand-alone book. The Chronicles of Narnia is a classic that I think everyone should read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Id give it 10 stars if I could! Took me till now to start watching this so I was able to watch every episode back to back which was nice!  But now I'm caught up I'm a little bummed that I have to wait for each episode.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was one of the best I have ever read. I liked the ideas and the concept. Greek mythology was an interest of mine so this made me like it even more. I like to imagine I am a daughter of a god sometimes. Thank you Rick Riordan.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I loved the first one and I hear many say this is better than the first but to me theres no contest they both rock! Ive been wanting a movie like this for a long time. Jet Li doesn't make much of an appearance which is too bad and I think the same goes for a lot of the characters as well, maybe its just too many big names in one short film to make them all count where they should. I bought this without seeing it and I have zero regrets, cant wait to watch it again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is really easy & enjoyable to play this game.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes to play Bingo.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use.  Can't beat the price.  Very easy to see and use.  Comes in handy, especially the tip function.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's really a fun game & easy to play.  I don't like that it doesn't tell you that there are no more moves.  I would recommend this game to anyone that likes to play cards.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I purchased this album during the holiday. It wasn't even on my list of music to think about purchasing, but I saw it for $1.99, so I went for it. I am glad I did. It is worth every penny, I would pay $9.99 for this album. Great sound and a lot if fun to sing along with in the car.
0765325950|4.0|spoiler-free<br /><br />Let's face it, there is no reader out there metaphorically tossing this book's hefty weight from hand to hand thinking, \\"Should I or shouldn't I, should I or shouldn't I?\\" and then coming here to see what the reviews say. If you've read books 1-13, you aren't stopping now. And if you haven't read books 1-13, you aren't reading this review. Which means basically I could write the equivalent of Charlie Brown's teacher-speak here -- \\"Wahwah woh wah wha wahwah\\" -- and it wouldn't matter one jot. But \\"The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,\\" as they say . . .<br /><br />First, if you like fights and battles, hoo boy will you like A Memory of Light. Because this 900-page book is basically one big, ongoing, relentless fight scene. And that's a word -- relentless -- I'd use if forced to choose just one in describing it. The first 300 pages are somewhat setup as players on both sides arrange themselves in preparation for the final battle. But \\"setup\\" is relative in this book. We're not six pages in before we're tossed into the middle of a fierce city defense against rampaging Trollocs, a fight that we go back and forth between amongst other, less frantic plotlines. That battle ends around 75 pages later, and we get a little breather in perhaps the least action-based section of the novel (though still time for a rescue attempt and a magical fight), which lasts for about 100 pages before we're thrown into another full-scale battle. From that point on, the next 700 or so pages are a series of geographically separated battles where our main characters are in separate groups, and then those battles eventually merge into one almost incomprehensibly huge battle where all are characters are in the same rough place: at the mouth of Shayol Ghul.<br /><br />The separate battles are broken up by several long chase scenes/fights involving Perrin and Slayer and by Mat's storyline whereby he becomes Tuon's husband in more than simply title (as in she begins to place her trust in him) and then becomes the general of her army. The single epic battle -- the \\"Last Battle\\" -- takes up almost half the book. It is only broken up, and this only slightly, by Rand's separate battle with the Dark One, a less physical, more metaphorical fight that takes place outside the actual fighting (indeed, outside the Pattern itself). I suppose one could also argue that the frantic, epic battle writ large is also broken up by a series of one-on-one sword duels that take place and by some small scenes here and there between individuals. But really, it pretty much is a non-stop, relentless, sweep-you-along-or-be-crushed fight scene.<br /><br />How you will react to this is a matter of taste. To be honest, I would have preferred less fighting, as it began to feel a bit repetitive, especially the earlier battles and Perrin's chase scenes. Once the Last Battle began, though, it was nigh impossible not to get swept along in its breakneck pace and epic scale, though again, there were a few segments I thought were a bit too repetitive and some individual scenes varied in their emotional impact or sense of tension. The same is true for the death scenes, of which there are many. And I mean many. Several pack a wallop, some hit you at least a little, and others were a bit perfunctory.<br /><br />Surprisingly, and somewhat disappointingly, the storyline dealing with Rand and the Dark One in Shayol Ghul felt mostly anticlimactic and not all that original. I won't say more to avoid spoilers, but while I do think we needed some variety of tone and pace (it couldn't all be hacking and being hacked), these segments didn't quite fill the bill for me. They felt a bit out of place, or if not out of place, not as seamlessly integrated as they needed to be. The same goes for a big chunk of Perrin's storyline, which I felt suffered from being redundant and a bit monotone (save for one excellent and powerful scene at the very end). Mat's section also had its recurring momentsand themes, but overall I thought it was the most interesting long-term arc in the book, the one with the most plot variety and the most character growth. Lots of other characters get some great moments, some get more than one or two, a few are a bit robbed of their moment to shine, and a few get theirs a little cheaply (one, for instance, was tainted by a heaping spoonful of Deus Ex Machina).<br /><br />All of which makes this a very fitting ending to this long-running series, one that I admit started to disappoint after the first four books or so. It's hard to over-emphasize how much is packed into this one book; even at 900 pages it feels overstuffed. And I do think Sanderson has done an excellent job of streamlining (hard as that is to believe) and of improving pacing; he deserves a lot of credit for taking up a pretty thankless job: replacing a beloved author to close out a beloved series. But more isn't always more. I enjoyed A Memory of Light, and as I said, was often swept up in it. Individually, each fight scene, each duel, each skirmish or battle or stands well on its own. But I would have probably skipped the four early battles, a duel here and there, and cut out a few hundred pages.<br /><br />Just as I would have cut out a good number of books from the series as a whole. I absolutely loved the start of this series. And Jordan kept me going for a while, even after some of his tics grew tiresome or as the plot was less able to cover up some weakness of style or character. But by the middle of the series I began to feel like I was plodding forward relatively joylessly. And I hate to say it, but I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone to start the series, since there is so much time to invest in it and I think the balance tips too far to the wrong side of readerly enjoyment. There is, I absolutely believe, an utterly great 5-6 book series buried in this 14-book narrative and I'd love to see almost an anti-Director's Cut (a former-fan's cut maybe) of thatversion. Or an HBO version (a la A Game of Thrones) that runs five seasons rather than fourteen. But while I wouldn't tell someone to start the series, I have to say that A Memory of Light does a mostly good and certainly an appropriate job of ending it for those of us who have been there from the beginning.<br />So to sum up, Wahwah woh wah wha wahwah.  (this was an ARC of the book, received for an original review at fantasyliterature.com)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book was not as good as book one or two, but you dont want to rush out of this one to get to book four.<br /><br />I would recommend reading book 4 and 5 via wiki and not suffering through them like me.  Book 5 had a good ending, but that was about it.

B005LAII3U|2.0|I have received two copies of this BluRay from Amazon and both of them had a Doby True HD soundtrack that kept cutting out. I am using a Denon 1913 AVR with and Oppo BDP 93 BluRay player both with the latest firmware updates.  The video is fine in this movie but, for whatever reason, Sony messed up the sound. I quite enjoyed the movie itself but this enjoyment was disrupted by the cutoffs of audio at rtandom times!<br /><br />Sony needs to fix this problem and for that reason, I am holding off purchasing this again until the issues are resolved. Why didn't they encode it in DTS HD Master Audio? Doesn't Sony own this audio encoding format?<br /><br />Beware!

B0076DELIG|4.0|I almost didn't read this book because I read the 1 star reviews, but knowing Connelly's style, I took a chance and I must say I liked this book, so I'm going to offer the following advice: Read it.<br /><br />The book centers around Det. Harry Bosch who has been assigned to a cold case, slowly and methodically he tracks down the killer; all the while dealing with work and personal relationship issues. I found it to be an easy read, didn't need to keep going back over previous chapters as is the case with some books. It held my interest, and even at times had me thinking \\" why is Harry doing that\\" but as all Michael Connelly's novels everything worked out in the end.  If you're looking for a light, easy read mystery this is the book for you.<br /><br />Short Review:<br />Good story-line + well developed characters + easy read = Worth your time - READ IT
1401235417|5.0|This author knows what he's doing. Not only did he create an intriguing storyline for our hero, he also tied in some fantastic characters in a unique way while setting the stage for a new character to get his own comic. Any batman fan's going to need this.

B009IEXKXI|2.0|This book is written in  the form of journal entries documenting the trials of a man stuck on Mars. The writing came across a juvenile, and after trying three times I was only able to get through 9% of the book. There was very little building up of any form of tension, and a lot of the main character describing his own genius in finding solutions to his problems. Most irritating to me was the fact that this man, fighting to stay alive, showed little to no emotion reflecting his situation. He is not stressed, or scared, just collected and focused, making constant attempts at being witty. In the end the character was utterly unbelievable, and got on my nerves.

B0098466CK|4.0|Heavier, deeper, as many have said. I think this plays more like a collection of singles than an album, compared with the last three.<br /><br />My favorites are \\"Cloak of Feathers\\", addictive riffs, hard time listening to it just once. \\"Hidden Masters\\", ominous, scolding, dirge-like. \\"Dying Earth\\", genuinely epic, head banging. \\"Seven Sisters\\", really builds power, gets you singing along. \\"Eyes of the Stormwitch\\", swagger. \\"Apocryphon\\", great interplay between vocals and guitar, worthy of the title track.<br /><br />My less-favorites would be \\"Hawks and Serpents\\", which just seems to go on too long, and \\"Execrator\\", which some may like, though not me, yet.<br /><br />This album shows the most post production work of the four released so far by The Sword. This is often a good thing, certainly you can understand every word without checking the lyrics here, though I think the vocal effects are bit overused in this case, (though this gets more distracting on a good headphones or similar.  I think they had reached the right balance on Warp Riders; here the vocal doubling has often gone too far for my taste. Generally though, the instrument balance and sound is very good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it I didn't know there was two more books. I hope the will make a movie about it.. Great
B000000OPZ|5.0|This classic album is worth buying over and over again.  My fiance's old one had gotten scratched over time, so I ordered this one to replace his.  He's not ready for the MP3 stage yet, but this used CD was in excellent condition.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I cannot praise this more highly; I have been a fan of Alice Munro's for years and this does not disappoint.  She is one of the great short story writers now writing and if you haven't read her yet, this is as good a place to start as any.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|This movie is so truly awful, its almost unreal. I have been a fan of the games since their creation, and years ago when they came out with the first film, I was really excited to see it come to the big screen. Like most, I found the first couple films to be mediocre, but not all bad. There were good fighting sequences, and the CGI was done well enough, so I didn't feel the first couple to be a complete waste of my time. The next movie was on the verge of awful, but still not all bad and had a few redeeming qualities. It was the film which is the prequel to this one where I started wondering \\"what am I doing still watching this?\\" They spent so much time focused on the fact that it was in 3D and being sure there was enough crap flying at the screen that they didn't seem to even bother to write a good plot or any proper character development. But Retribution takes the cake in the \\"which one is worst\\" contest. Retribution was an overall waste of my time. To be honest, I never intended to see this movie, but my husband wanted to watch it so we rented from the redbox. I tried to keep an open mind, but it was no use. Of course once again, too much time was focused on things flying at the screen, and once again, no character development and no overall plot. But the worst thing about this film in my opinion was where they drag you through ten minutes of recap over the past four films. I highly doubt there was anyone watching this that hadn't been following the other movies, and since these movies never run more than an hour and a half, ten minutes of recap and seven minutes of the opening sequence shown to you first backward and in slow motion during the initial opening credits and then again after the recap, so I felt to be a giant waste of what little time there is to get to the point. Seventeen minutes out of an hour and a half film is a significant chunk of time that could have been put to better use. Then there's the kid Alice picks up from one of the \\"simulated outbreak scenarios\\" which she decides to become a mother to simply because she was programmed to be her mother in an a simulation (I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV\\" is what it made me think of). I was also very disappointed in the portrayal of Ada Wong. Her part was too short, and there was no effort made to get to know her character, or anyone else for that matter. This movie was an overall disappointment and if I could give it zero stars I would. I will not be watching the next film. They're not suckering me out of another dollar.ak scenarios\\" which she decides to become a mother to simply because she was programmed to be her mother in an a simulation (I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV\\" is what it made me think of).

B0099G6Q5E|2.0|Some songs are the same and true to the movie, while other songs (Cups, for example), are different versions.  There is a slightly annoying echo to the vocals in the songs - almost like autotune was used.  The singers in the movie can stand on their own and I was happier with the movie version of the soundtrack.  Bottom line is if you like the songs but aren't particular about vocal quality, you will be happy with this soundtrack.  If you enjoy the vocals in the movie and want a soundtrack more true to the movie, then you probably won't like this.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|If you saw the Johnny Depp movie a few years ago, you might think you know this story line.  And in a sense, you sort of do.

You learn about her early life, her mother, witchcraft, and about more about the other people in this little village, suddenly blessed with a chocolaterie that upsets the normal order of things.  It's a charming book that should be savored like an exquisite bon-bon.

B0052UYJDC|5.0|I am always looking for books to help me get better organized and this book does better that that! It helps you pare down on useless stuff. We had an entire bedroom crammed with stuff and needed that space for an actual room! This book was a catalyst for helping me be brave enough to roll up my sleeves and get to work on downsizing. It feels so much better donating our clothes and other items we don't use as opposed to stuffing them all in closets and rooms and closing the door. This is also helping me with relationships because people really are more important than things!

B0095P33IW|1.0|If you thought Steven Spielberg was shallow and hollywood, get ready to meet your maker. Filled with one liners and rushed sub plots, this movie has explosions! It literally starts with the end and then spends the rest of the movie explaining how it got there. And then it ends. I didn't have time to connect or fall in love with any of the characters I'm supposed to empathize with. And the allied soldiers have such a hard time fighting the germans until captain america shows up, then its a complete cake walk, even for 400 soldiers to sneak up to the red skull's secret lair.<br /><br />The part that really takes the cake is how the movie seems to overreach in an obvious attempt to paint women in a better light. Not only is a woman second lieutenant but also the one leading the charge at the end. And really in the entire US Army they couldn't find anyone else for the most important battle of the war? Are there only 5 heads fighting WWII that keep rotating roles? And seriously, all Peggy Carter does is disobey orders and tell Steve Rogers to go ahead and do things that would get any normal man killed. In an era where women had just gained the right to vote, it would be like a civil war story in which an african american was Lincoln's secretary of state.<br /><br />So in short, no, it was not a good movie.<br /><br />*spoilers* oh and the red skull gets a hold of the cube of odin and what does he do with it? He makes batteries...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book grabbed my attention and kept me on edge all the way to the last word! I found myself rushing through my daily chores just to get back to reading!!

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I don't normally write reviews (I've probably only written like 5 EVER. So when I do write one, it's because I love it. Plus I like to support my favorite artists out there).I bought Bruno Mars last album and I absolutely love it. It's one of those albums where the more you listen to it the more you love every song. I was extremely excited for his new CD and it is great already. I got it for Christmas and I've only had the chance to listen to it a few times, but the songs are relaxing/soulful/and just the right amount of pop to be catchy. All in all, I recommend this CD as well as his last one.

A Very dear book to me all in all very thought provoking sometimes it got really real as in a story that could've easily happened to me didn't devoured the pages but I enjoyed every single thing I read and lot made me remember a lot about being rejected and odd growing up and just how that really affects us a  we grow older not necessarily more wise but with the same basic needs its just that as you grow you learn to look for people that are actually worth it and just how important that is in friendships or relationships

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had some minor drops with my phone and the case protection worked fine. It is just now starting to get a tinge of yellow to the plastic, but it's not very noticeable. And honestly, the yellow could be just as much due to makeup and being tossed around in my purse as it is to just regular wear and tear. My only gripe has been the little bubble on the screen protector that I just never could get out. User error it would seem.

0765325950|5.0|The Wheel of Time is finished. That's a statement that's going to take a while to get used to. The first volume of the series, The Eye of the World, was published in January 1990. George Bush Snr. and Margaret Thatcher were still in power and the Cold War was still ongoing. Fourteen books, four million words, eleven thousand pages and over fifty million sales (in North America alone) later, the conclusion has finally arrived. Can it possibly live up to the expectations built up over that time?<br /><br />It is a tribute to the plotting powers of Robert Jordan, the writing skill of Brandon Sanderson (who took over the series after Jordan's untimely death in 2007) and the hard work of Jordan's editors and assistants that A Memory of Light is - for the most part - a triumphant finale. Given the weight of expectations resting on the novel, not to mention the unfortunate circumstances under it was written, it is unsurprising that it is not perfect. The novel occasionally misfires, is sometimes abrupt in how it resolves long-running plot strands and sometimes feels inconsistent with what has come before. However, it also brings this juggernaut of an epic fantasy narrative to an ending that makes sense, is suitably massive in scope and resolves the series' thematic, plot and character arcs satisfactorily - for the most part.<br /><br />It is a familiar viewpoint that The Wheel of Time is a slow-burning series, with Robert Jordan not afraid to have his characters sitting around talking about things for entire chapters (or, in one case, an entire novel) rather than getting on with business. However, Jordan at his best used these lengthy dialogue scenes to set up plot twists and explosive confrontations further down the line, pulling together the elements he'd established previously in surprising and interesting ways. This reached a high in the slow-moving sixth book, which ended with what is regarded by many as the series' best climax to date at the Battle of Dumai's Wells.Steven Erikson (whose Malazan series is the most notable recent mega-long fantasy series to have also reached a final conclusion) used the term 'convergence' for such structural climaxes and it's fair to say that this is what A Memory of Light is: a convergence for the entire series. All thirteen of the previous novels lined up plot cannons in preparation for the Last Battle, and in the closing chapters of Towers of Midnight Brandon Sanderson started triggering them.<br /><br />The result is not The Wheel of Time you may be familiar with. A Memory of Light is a brutal, bruising, 900-page war novel that kicks off with all hell breaking loose and doesn't pause for breath until the ending. The prologue starts with a well-paced sequence as we find out the state of play for the major characters, intercut with Talmanes and the Band of the Red Hand engaging hordes of Shadowspawn on the streets of Caemlyn. The rotation of scenes between the desperate street fighting and more familiar politicking is highly effective and is exhausting in itself. Immediately after this we alternate between Rand's attempts to pull together a coalition against the Shadow whilst a small group of Asha'man try to save their organisation from destruction against overwhelming odds. No sooner is that over than the Last Battle is joined in full force. Vast armies clash, channellers engage one another in One Power exchanges that dwarf anything seen before in the series and lots of stuff blows up. There's more action sequences in A Memory of Light than the rest of the series put together, more than earning the adage 'The Last Battle'.<br /><br />The action sequences (which make up almost the whole book) are, for the most part, impressive but benefit from unpredictability. Jordan has been criticised for making his characters too safe, with almost no major character of note (on either side) dying in the previous books of the series. This limitation has been removed for the Last Battle. Major characters, middling ones and scores of minor ones are scythed down in this final confrontation with near-wild abandon. Some get heroic, fitting, blaze-of-glory ends. Some die in manners so unexpected, offhand and callous that even George R.R. Martin might nod in approval. Many of the survivors are seriously wounded, either in body or mind. Jordan's experiences as a Vietnam vet informed Rand al'Thor's arc in The Gathering Storm, and resurface here when one major character is tortured by the Shadow before being rescued, but spends the rest of the book suffering the effects of his experiences. The war scenes are suitably epic and exciting, but Sanderson remembers to include moments counting the cost of such a struggle.<br /><br />That said, there is an annoying discrepancy in the Last Battle sequence compared to earlier novels. Based on the army sizes in previous volumes and the number of channellers in each faction, the good guys should have brought the better part of a million troops and five thousand One Power-wielders to the Last Battle, and the Shadow several times more. There is no indication that such vast numbers are present, which seems rather odd. There is also the fact that the channellers suddenly seem to be much less effective in mass combat than previously shown. This is most blatant when Logain is angrily told that he and a couple of dozen Asha'man cannot hope to defeat a hundred thousand Trollocs by themselves. Given this is exactly what happened in one scene in Knife of Dreams, I can only conclude that the channellers were deliberately reduced in power for this book, which is very strange.<br /><br />For the most part, this is the level of problems A Memory of Light presents: something mildly irritating to those who prefer consistency from fictional works but ultimately not hugely relevant to the overall thrust of the narrative. Similar issues can be found with a number of very minor subplots that the novel fails to resolve (or even address) from earlier volumes. In some cases these may be examples of what Robert Jordan himself said would happen in the last book, with some elements left deliberately hanging to give the illusion that life goes on after the last page is turned. In other cases, it may be that Jordan did not draft out how those storylines ended, so Sanderson chose to leave them rather than risk too inventing too much of his own material. Sanderson even refuses to name an important river that Jordan did not name himself, resulting is a slightly awkward battle sequence where characters talk about the 'river on the border', the 'river on the battlefield' and so on, which is a bit laboured.<br /><br />However, whilst the war scenes rage there is also a philosophical struggle at the heart of the book, and of the series. This struggle is shown in the confrontation between Rand and the Dark One in which their visions of the world and the Wheel are shown in conflict with one another. Robert Jordan was convinced that whilst there were certainly complexities and shades of grey in real life, he also believed that real good and real evil existed, and these ideas form part of the philosophical struggle that takes place alongside the battles. How successful this is will vary (perhaps immensely) from reader to reader, but is not helped by some muddling of the issues. The primary struggle of the books has consistently been Good vs. Evil, but in this philosophy-off the idea of the Creator personifying Order and the Dark One Chaos also arises, possibly as their primary roles. This is in conflict with the rest of the series and is also more tiresomely familiar and predictable. Once that interpretation arises, it's impossible not to think of the ending of the Shadow War in the TV series Babylon 5, and the resolution we get is not a million miles away from it (Rand even gets a line almost as awful as \\"Get the hell out of our galaxy!\\").<br /><br />On the prose side of things, it's pretty much the same set-up as The Gathering Storm andTowers of Midnight: acceptable, faster-paced and a bit less prone to unnecessary introspection. Where Sanderson comes undone (yet again) is his very occasional use of terminology and language that Jordan would never have used, particularly modern words and terms. Though relatively rare, they still jar a little bit when they appear. The book's centrepiece is a single chapter that is almost 200 pages (and 70,000 words) long in hardcover, with some 70 POV characters playing a role. Apparently both Sanderson and Jordan wrote parts of this chapter, and a few minor inconsistencies aside their writing styles mesh very well. The very last section of the epilogue, written by Robert Jordan himself before he passed (including, rather eerily, Jordan's epitaph from his own funeral), is indeed a fitting way to end the book.<br /><br />Taking everything into account, A Memory of Light is a lot better than perhaps we had any right to expect. The book is a relentless steamroller of action, explosions, plot resolutions, deaths and philosophical (if somewhat confused) arguing. Some elements are under-resolved, or a little too convenient, or not fleshed out enough. But that's par for the course with any ending to a series this huge. The big questions are answered, the final scene is fitting and the story ends in a way that is true to itself, which is the most we can ask for.

B0085RQLXK|5.0|This is a good album: don't understand the bad reviews. What did you expect? New music direction? They never had it. The new bands doesn't have it too. They're the good old Aerosmith, doing their stuff: melodic hard rock, with some ballads. There is more than a peak here and \\"Street Jesus\\" is a hell of a song.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is an emotional rollercoaster, full of hope, love and perseverance.  As always Sparks  manages to bring you into the book, filling it with suspense to keep you on edge and hanging on his every word !  The book makes you appreciate life and the joy of living.  Five stars!

B0053KWDES|5.0|This is a very high quality, compact product that is a perfect match for use with an ipod.  There's a marked difference in overall sound quality, not just higher volume.  Smooth, clean bass response and better separation and tonal quality.  The design and controls- a very smooth volume knob, are very well done. While listening to this setup, I use a pair of Etymotic Research ER series earplugs, and I have definitely noticed the improvement, which I use primarily on my Triumph Sprint motorcycle, and for air travel.  I'm very pleased with this product.
B008W31IFS|2.0|This is without doubt one of Connelly's 'stinkers'!!!  Didn't think I would<br />ever say that, but a suspenseful retrial of a child killer gets 'sidetracked'<br />by an unbelievable, illogical twist when the retried felon concludes that his<br />case is lost ... therefore, he must 'kill off' those who screwed up ... namely<br />his flamboyant defense counsel, assistant & a police officer who just happen<br />to be part of the surveillance team dogging him since his release from custody.<br />The question that begs to be answered is 'Why' was this monster released in<br />the first place?<br /><br />  Connelly is simply churning out too many books at too rapid a pace; the qual-<br />ity we have become accustomed to has become secondary to the mission  of<br />producing more pulp fiction as gross commercialism.  Shame on you, M. C.
B008R5OJXE|5.0|I find this new 3-CD set of Giulio Cesare, with Il Complesso Barocco conducted as ever by Handel speciliast, Alan Curtis, an unqualified triumph, both sonically and musically.<br /><br />French Canadian contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux is stunning in the title role. She turns in a towering performance, full of passion, fire and masculine swagger. Sample her richly textured singing of the great hunting aria, 'Va tacito e nascosto' (CD 1 track 26), the resplendid obbligato horn passages well to the fore, not least in the fine cadenza that rounds it off so triumphantly.<br /><br />As Cleopatra, Lemieux's compatriot, Karina Gauvin, is predictably ravishing. Sustaining her reputation as today's reigning queen of Handel opera performance, the soprano - I beg to differ with another reviewer on this site - successfully runs the gambit of emotions the role demands through each of the eight glorious arias Handel wrote for his muse, Francesca Cuzzoni.<br /><br />Madame Gauvin's heart-stopping singing in the opera's famous seduction number, 'V'adoro, pupille', is the loveliest I've heard. Ditto her heartfelt renderings of her two great laments, 'Se pieta', and 'Piangero, la sorte mia'; she turns in a delicately etched performance of 'La tua mia stella sei' and a spectacular account of Cleopatra's final show-stopper, 'Da tempeste il legno infranto'.<br /><br />Romina Basso's gravely beautliful contralto is admirably suited to the music of the widow, Cornelia, and contrasts effectively with the youthful sounding soprano of Emöke Baráth as her son, Sesto. The rest of the cast do not disappoint.<br /><br />Maestro Curtis himself wrote the superb embellishments for the da capo sections of the arias in this remarkable set, and one's listening is significantly enhanced by an edifying programme note by Olivier Rouvière and a lucid translation of the opera's libretto by Nicola Francesco Haym.<br /><br />Well worth the wait, this highly recommended release endorses the accolade Naïve received at the 2012 Gramophone Awards as Label of the Year.

B007EDYN36|5.0|I had heard all the reviews about the book and now that I have finished it, I agree.  While I cling to hope about one more concert with the original members, after reading Peters' side of the story, I can see why that may not happen.  But this book tells it like it is.

0765325950|1.0|Forcing me to wait three months or read the book new because you won't sell me the format I want. I'm not price sensitive, 2.4 lb brick versus a 7.5 oz Kindle PaperWhite. Grow up Tor.
0765325950|1.0|i have already bought the physical book at the day of release, i had pre-ordered the audio-book on audible.com and i wanted to buy the kindle ebook for reading on the bus for my commute supplemented whit listening on the audio book when i am walking. i have the physical book for my book shelf and for reading when i am at home. i cant phantom how they can do thin on the 14 book of this series, do they really believe it would hurt their sales releasing the e-book together whit the finale book? Now people are going to waiting for letherbound copies for their bookshelf.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved all the Steig Larsson's books. So sorry to hear he has passed away and there will be no more great books.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I absolutely loved this game. I had my roommates and kids download it and we all played it together until we finished the final battle. We all loved it!!! It was just the right difficulty level to be able to solve the levels without getting overly frustrated. Very doable and provided tons of entertainment! I'd love to see more games like this one! Don't forget to do the bonus winter level and also check out the trophy room for additional things to do in game.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|The Walking Dead Series gets a 5, but buying the whole series on line has not worked for me.  I can watch it on the computer (ugh!) but have not been able to watch on my Amazon enabled TV or Blu-ray player.  I can buy them on the TV and watch, but cannot get to them to play without paying again on my Amazon registered device.<br /><br />Update:  I did finally figure out how to upload the episodes to my DVR.  There just are not clear instructions that I could find.  It can be done, but you have to go through several steps in the right order that are not that apparent.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|A bit of mystery associated with the character and the “book”.  There was plenty of action and in the end a good moral lesson.  Very entertaining
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Lots of fun+ addictive as the ad says. Builds your mind. Trouble is these things are a waste of time. Go outside for a walk instead.
0765325950|5.0|Amazon should seriously put aside the reviews of people who are simply whining about the format.  This is a hardcover book, people -- if you don't like it you don't have to buy it.  Wait for the spring and purchase it in digital format if reading this story on your e-reader is so gravely important to you.<br /><br />This final volume was excellent.  Imperfect, perhaps, but excellent nonetheless.  It doesn't deserve 1 or 2 star reviews from people with no other complaint than that it is in the very format they chose to purchase it in.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a huge fan of Jane Austen. I also read numerous books on Regency/Historical and Scottish Historical Romance. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are featured by many authors in sequels to Pride and Prejudice of which have given many insights to what different could have been a possible future for them if Ms. Austen had had a longer life to write such sequels herself. All were most enjoyable.
B004WR125O|5.0|Im very happy with this product, now I could have both<br />internet connections, wired and wireless, work like a CHARM..<br />100 stars
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved most of Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. It's very well written. She is gifted in character development. I had read her second book so I expected this one to be dark, and it did get darker as the book neared it conclusion.<br /><br />My problem is that as the book wore on I started to dislike all the characters. As the book concluded, I had no one to root for and actually concluded that both characters deserved each other. They were pathetic.<br /><br />Although, I enjoed the character development in the book and plot twists, I had a bad taste in my mouth when it ended.

B009B0CZXU|5.0|While many critics derided Natasha Khan for eschewing her old ways--lush orchestral arrangements, mythical lyrics, complex drumming--this new version makes the music, and the themes behind it, more visceral and accessible than ever.  Khan's vocals are softer, more hurt, and resonate long after the closing of &#34;Deep Sea Diver.&#34; The stripped-down beats and overall dearth of strings bring you closer, like story time, to the tales of loves lost. Her voice sails over massive drums on standouts &#34;Horses of the Sun&#34; and &#34;Marilyn,&#34; which sound more like something off of Fur and Gold than off of her last effort, the luxurious Two Suns. And previously mentioned &#34;Deep Sea Diver&#34; is the best album-closer Khan has ever delivered; a fitting end to an uplifting tale of tragedy, discovery, and triumph.
B000VD5I94|5.0|Loved the original Robocop movie. We took my son with us to see the movie when it was first released. He doesn't remember that because he was about 2 yrs old; but I believe that is why he also loves the first Robocop.  This was purchased as a Christmas gift for him - he's working on replacing his old DVDs with Blu-ray - it's gonna take him a while because he has about 100 movies.  Whenever he's ready to purchase another Blu-ray movie, I tell him to check Amazon first - 9 out of 10 times Amazon has the best price, best quality, and fastest delivery.

0060589280|1.0|This is the second Paulo Coelho book I read, after The Alchemist but quite confused as to what the author is trying to say.<br />Is this a reflection of the life of a prostitute or just a sex manual exploiting the female genitals?<br />The plot is very simple. A poor Brazilian girl comes to Europe looking for money becomes a prostitute but her life being a prostitute is not so bad according to this book, filled with excitement and after spending just 1 year in Swiss brothel she earns enough money for her future. Her life then is well and fine. And what's the big issue with this female genitals...

B005MMJ84K|5.0|D'abord j'ai essayé de me souvenir ce qui m'avait tant plu dans Delirium, puis j'ai commencé Pandemonium. Et là sans comprendre je me suis à nouveau laissée aspirer dans l'histoire.<br />Et là ça devient vraiment surprenant, parce-que d'habitude l'héroïne a son prince charmant et même si un chevalier avec une belle armure apparaît,  nous, lectrice totalement dans la peau de l'héroïne, on reste fatalement fidèle à notre prince charmant. Et bien là pour une fois c'est tellement bien mené et les émotions sont tellement bien développées qu' on se retrouve complètement prise. dans le triangle amoureux tel qu'on le serait dans la réalité, prise en étau entre désir et culpabilité. Et le final: l'apothéose! Vivement Requiem

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a thrilling and captivating  story. I stayed up late for three days to read this book. I just couldn't wait to finish and I want more.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This entire book was middle of the road for me. The story was just gripping enough to keep me turning the page, however the characters were so unlikable that I found myself not really caring what happened to them in the end, which I guess is a good thing because the ending was the worst ending to a book I have ever read. It is that bad!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Took me through the horrible times of the 2nd world war  but<br />kept a strong feelling of hope and optimism all through the tale.<br />Characters well defined, inter-relations plausible and the story<br />flows smoothely.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|This is a very slow moving plot involved film, it does have some good action but sadly it is over just as it starts moving.  This is obviously only the introduction to what we can believe several other &#34;Bourne&#34; movies.  It was a big let down, wait til it comes on TV then watch.

Can you help me with this as I would like to have the full uncut version as seen in the theater.  Thank you
B00340ESIS|5.0|Loved this book.  I found it very helpful in helping me develop a solid story.  I feel a lot closer to writing the script that was just an idea in my head before reading this.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|This book held my interest until the end. In fact, I find I did not want it to end! I found myself holding my breath. I loved this book! Fascinating!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The thing I like best about this app is that there are versions for Android and iOS, plus an associated website, so one can create an account and have their favorites (presets) sync across all devices. It also allows custom links in case your favorite stream isn't in their database. I have this app installed on my iPod Touch, my Android phone, and now on my Kindle Fire. It works flawlessly on all of them.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love the ability to stream this new season of the waking dead. The HD is a little more expensive but worth it.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The animation was excellent and story was well told. The consequence of pride is always a great lesson to teach.  Viewers under the age of 13 may need interpretation of the lesson as they may not get it.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent connection of historical fiction to facts.  This book is extremely difficult to put down.  I am so looking forward to reading the next book in this trilogy.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I only faintly remember the Tintin comics from my youth. I never had any but a friend I had when I was 5 did. After watching this I feel compelled to track down all those comics and collect them. In a sense I can see where this type of fiction from the WWII era led to the Indiana Jones type of adventure story.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Always loved this movie and glad to have it on a  more permanant medium.  One movie you want to keep for viewing.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Walking in Harold's shoes was a humbling, sad human truth about how our childhood can haunt us in many ways, consciously or otherwise.  But at the end its about love, not just romantic love, and one is left tearful at knowing there's hope.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|My basic rating catagory is the convenience of the Kindle Fire I have.  I really like reading this book on the Kindle.  It is a good book with much &#34;Press,&#34; highly sensationalized.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have enjoyed this whole series. Great writing and characters. Very happy with how the story ended. Can't wait for the movie...
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a really fun game. It's easy to pickup and put down if you only have a few minutes to kill. Unfortunately this free app comes along with pop up ads after EVERY single round so that can get annoying pretty quickly if you're playing for a bit.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game! I was really sad when I finished, and I can`t wait for the next one in the series.
B009YQJ322|4.0|To say that DREDD is an improvement on the Stallone interpretation is missing the point.  JUDGE DREDD is one of those films that's just so awful, you can't help but watch it.  DREDD is not that kind of film.  Not to say it's a great piece of cinema; it isn't, far from it.  But as an action film that doesn't take itself too seriously, it's definitely a welcome adaptation.<br /><br />The plot is simple: the titular judge of few words and a psychic rookie along for the ride check out a triple homicide in a 200-story skyscraper kingdom ruled with an iron fist by drug lord Ma-Ma.  When the judges take one of Ma-Ma's men prisoner, she overreacts and shuts the building down.  The judges now have to shoot their way out.  You know what happens next.<br /><br />Karl Urban brings some excellent screen presence to the role of Dredd; his face mostly covered (yes, comic fans, the entire movie!), he speaks in a harsh drawl that conveys an excellent mix of menace and humor.  Olivia Thirlby, as the rookie Anderson, is a welcome surprise, especially when her character is given permission to get down and dirty and kick some bad guy butt.  As Ma-Ma, Lena Headey is a menacing delight; it's a shame that her character isn't given more to do, and that the ultimate showdown is so sudden and disappointing.  If anything, that is perhaps DREDD's biggest weakness: with such a small premiss (characters stuck inside a skyscraper, no way to go but up and out), the film needs to drown in tension.  It doesn't.  There are no real stakes; we know Dredd will get out alive, and we know the bad guy (or girl) will be punished.  DREDD offers some good imagery, some great action sequences, and a nice lead turn from Urban; but it lacks anything surprising or original.  Still, for someone wanting a more faithful adaptation, something darker and more action-driven, then this is a good enough film.  Far from anything great, but it's definitely an enjoyable 90-odd minutes, and you can do far worse out there.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|this is very convenient for the winter sales and logging in on mobile was part of the one achievement. I let my brother use it.
0765325950|2.0|First of all, I bought the book in hardback because I can't wait until April or even a few days when someone will most likely have converted it to Ebook.  It was said that ebook was not immediate because it affected the Times Best Seller rankings and the supposed sales that entail.  Unfortunately for the owner/publisher, that specific ranking for this genre is not nearly as helpful as Amazon's ranking, blogs, forums, etc.  I am guessing they will shortly recognize this grave error.  In 2010, e-readers had blossomed into what they are now and people have a right to be outraged.  5 Stars because I love the series.  Taking away 3 because of greed.  Sometimes, losing money is the only way people will understand their mistakes.  Listen to what your customers want next time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book if you like action books and just full of stuff you don't see coming from every page you read
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Perfect addition to any collection. We are a new Harry Potter fans and this was an awesome gift from Santa Claus.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Loved reading this book during the christmas time.  Very enjoyable. I recomend it for anyone.  A book that needs to be read every year.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|O.K., FIRST....a GRIPE about FRY'S ELECTRONICS - DON'T EXPECT THEM TO HAVE ANYTHING THAT THEY ADVERTISE IN STOCK!!!  Visited Fry's New Year's sale to take advantage of low price on CaseLogic 206 backpack bag.  Guess what?  NOT IN STOCK!!!  Two other items not there as well.  Found the FANTASTIC backpack bag at AMAZON BASICS.  For me it easily transports 2 D600s with attached battery packs, a 80-200 2.8, a 24-85mm, two other prime lenses, an on-camera strobe, batteries, cords, extra SD cards, straps and much more.  It's attractive and well thought out.  The price is unbeatable.  DON'T SHOP FRY'S!!  Get this bag instead!!  I just wish it were a little bit larger - for flash accessories, brackets, etc.  A GREAT VALUE!<br /><br />amending the above:  it's STILL a great bag - just a little too small for my needs.  had to spend much more than i would've liked for another bag that was perfectly-sized.  the amazon bag is still better designed and appointed.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|1997PG: I can't believe that Contact totally ripped off Charlie Sheen's 1996 movie The Arrival; and only a year later ... WOW. I mean the SETI discovery scenes were virtually concept-for-concept.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Contact, you'll definitely enjoy The Arrival.

B004P2HMNM|5.0|My grandson who is 10 built this himself----it says it's for 16 and up. It was a challenge for him but he loved doing it. It's really neat and you can buy other buildings  to attach to this building. The inside has pets, people, plants, kitchenware, and bathroom items. It's adorable.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Hard to think of better work in Bosch series. The realism of the little dead ends shows gift of author.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Replicates the coin arcade game fairly well without the massive cost. Fun for my son who likes this game at Chucky Cheese.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|\\"I don't like it.\\"  \\"You will.\\"  \\"No, I won't.\\"  \\"You will. You do.\\"  \\"Oh, okay. You're right, I do.\\"    This is the relationship between these two in a nutshell. Don't get me wrong, I love erotic romances, and I love when two people can break through each other's shells. Gideon and Eva have a strong chemistry, but they are so blinded by sex that they don't realize there isn't anything real and tangible between them. They are not in love, they are in LUST. Lust can be powerful, but it can also be destructive. In this case, confusing love and lust has cost me the book series. I made it through the first and wanted to see where it went. After the fight between Gideon and Brett, I was over. Eva being so quick to s*** on herself was ridiculous. She'd set a squirrel on fire and eat it if he wanted her to. Where is the exciting, confident woman we were first introduced to in the first book? Why must she be portrayed as being willing to give up any sense of humanity for a man? All I see is a woman whose every fiber is being destroyed by a man who can get his rocks off by controlling her. That's abusive. It's not sexy. There is no mutual give. He says jump, she does it before she can ask how high.    I hated 50 Shades; I couldn't wait to throw that one in the burn pile. I like Sylvia Day. She writes great sex and created great chemistry with her characters. And I really wanted to like this story. I liked Eva so much more when she wasn't with Gideon, and that doesn't bode well for a romance. I just wished she had created people whose relationship was more fun. These two have no idea how to have fun together outside of the bedroom. If you want me to enjoy spending time with them, they have to be more real than they are. They're so damn depressing together that I no longer care to see where they go (which is not a secret, considering it's a romance and will have a formulaic ending).    Such a shame. I wish it was more fun to read than this.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this for my son for a Christmas present.  It's great quality. was sent quickly from the merchant.  If you're a batman fan you'll love this.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|My tablet is running version 2.1.1 and while this doesn't trigger the fact it isn't compatible, it simply doesn't play.
B004132HZS|5.0|Not one of these was a reason to stop holding my breath for SHERLOCK... they are all terrific, the acting is wonderful (and I'm a tried-n-true Basil Rathbone fan, which should tell you something!) This is a great concept and very well executed - the producers chose fine actors for the two main roles, and each comes across as completely credible and marvelously well done.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|As a slider puzzle it's pretty. I was able to do it for the first few levels and after that I had to resist the urge to toss my tablet!  If you are easily frustrated, go download something else.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|And of course, eventually had to have the DVD because it was so truly wonderful. It still is, too -- some of it doesn't quite get carried over on the DVD - those feelings you had the first time you saw it, but that's rather to be expected. I am still in awe of this musical in all its aspects!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Characters were so full of depth and emotion. The author took a tramatic story line and made it heartwarming and uplifting. Simply a beautiful story.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I have been playing this for a few days now and love it. I find it very interesting and a good way to pass the time. The graphics are a bit simple but the game play is easy to figure out.
B0022F1XW0|5.0|Fun music.  Brings me back to a simpler time with great music.  Perfect mix for hanging out in the sun.  Or anywhere else.
0062206044|5.0|I started reading this book to screen it for my easily-frightened 8 year old daughter. I decided she was not ready for A Series of Unfortunate Events, although I loved The Bad Beginning and continued through the series on my own. But she had other ideas. After plucking the book from our library and reading a chapter, and then another, and then another, she was as hooked , and even better, unperturbed by the sad circumstances of the Baudelaire orphans. She passed me in Book 11, The Grim Grotto and finished before I did.<br /><br />Lemony Snicket's love of the written word, playfullness with language and masterful plotting makes each page come alive. Although I liked some books better than others,  all were wickedly entertaining, enlightening and fun. We're already looking forward to rereading the series aloud with my seven year old son. It's a must read for clever kids.

The price was great, arrived promptly, in new condition.....couldn't ask for more!!

B006XBSAP2|5.0|Love Katy Perry! This particular cd I borrowed from one of my sisters and it got stuck in my car cd player. I loved the cd so much that when I replaced it I had to get one for myself.  A must buy!
