B00003CXTG|1.0|This is one of the worst WWII movies I have ever seen.  Very overrated.  If you want to see an outstanding WWII movie, go see Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List.  Intelligent movies that are very historically accurate.  Don't go waste your money on this piece of crap.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have a new love! No, nothing my wife should be worried about. Actually, it's her new love too. For Christmas she gave me the movie Serenity, which we had seen together in the theater, but she also gave me the series it was based on, Firefly. <br /> <br />Firefly has been described as a space western, which actually fits, but it would be more accurate to compare the main character and Captain of the ship, Mal Reynolds (pictured in the middle of the image above) as a Han Solo type character from the original 1977 Star Wars movie. Smuggler, pirate, and scoundrel are all terms that are applicable. Truth is, the American Civil War and the Millennium Falcon were both huge inspirations for Joss Whedon in creating this show.  <br /> <br />I have to admit that I have mixed emotions about this new love-on one hand I'm elated that I've found something that I so thoroughly enjoy. On the other hand it's depressing that I and just about the rest of the world missed this show when it was on the air and when our viewership could have kept it on the air. As a result, all we have is an abbreviated series and a movie. All of which is excellent, but it could have been so much more. <br /> <br />I blame the Fox Network. I vaguely remember seeing a commercial for it when it was premiering and thinking to myself that it looked cool, but I didn't catch the time and never heard anything more about it. It turns out that they did the same thing to it that they did to another series that I really enjoyed called Space Above and Beyond. <br /> <br />It seems like when Fox doesn't have faith in a show, they have no desire to promote it or put it in a time slot that will promote a following. Instead they move it around from night to night until it ends up on one of the poorest nights for T.V. and then pre-empt the heck out of it with sporting events until it becomes impossible for any reasonable person to keep up with it. <br /> <br />Anyway, I've found it now, and I love it. It's too bad that Fox didn't put more effort into gettting people to see it, because it seems that's all it takes for people to get hooked. I've already introduced it to a guy I work with and he likes it too. <br /> <br />Anyone who likes an entertaining story, sci-fi for not, give Fireflyand Serenity a try. You won't regret it.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Schindler's List takes us into one of the darkest chapters in human history.  The acting is outstanding from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes.  This is one of those films that everyone at the appropriate age should see.
B000002IAZ|5.0|I'm serious. This is packed with great songs, including For What It's Worth, Mr. Soul, Broken Arrow, Expecting to Fly, Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing, Rock 'n' Roll Woman and Bluebird. Any band with Neil Young and Stephen Stills on it has got to be great...I have proof both with this record and CSNY's Deja vu, not to mention Stills' brief appearence on After the Gold Rush. Young's songwriting talent is in full bloom on songs such as Mr. Soul and Broken Arrow, but Stills rivals him with Bluebird (my favorite Springfield tune) and For What It's Worth. In fact, the only real mistake on this album was not including Down to the Wire. Buy this!<br />On a sidenote, who can justify comparing Buffalo Springfield to Limp Bizkit? I don't care how popular they were, I will never forgive them for massacaring Behind Blue Eyes.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Movie was wonderful but the packaging was terrible. the dvd was scratched up. Amazon needs to do a better job of packaging the items. One part of the cd case was broken. The only reason i gave this item 5 satrs is because of how good the movie is.
0307276902|1.0|If you really want to read this book, go check it out of the library.  I bought it because it looked so interesting and I had heard good things about it, and turned around and sold it online once I'd finished it.  It is an unreasonable story, and more than likely more the made up part of memoirs.  If you read it and love it, then go buy it, but don't waste your time or money the first time around.
006056251X|4.0|Finding the perfect balance between character and back story can be a difficult skill to acquire. Kleypas, unfortunately, doesn't quite do that as well in Devil in Winter. This doesn't detract too much from the book, however. As a matter of fact, it comes across as the strongest of the Wallflower series so far (it's the third in a quartet). Fans of Kleypas will enjoy DIW and may potentially agree that it's one of her better books compared to the last couple years of her books.<br /><br />Evie Jenner is the daughter of a notorious boxer and gambler. Her father is dying and Evie's family refuses to allow her to visit him. They've abused her and are now trying to force her into marriage with a cousin so that they can control her father's money once he's dead. Evie sneaks out to visit Sebastian St. Vincent, the impoverished viscount who attempted to kidnap and rape Evie's friend, Lillian Bowman (It Happened One Autumn). She strikes a deal with him: He can marry her and have her money, so long as she's allowed to have her own portion and have freedom to care for her dying father. Oh, and no sex after the wedding night. St. Vincent agrees to the bargain and the story runs full tilt after that.<br /><br />Kleypas does an excellent job of making Sebastian into a rather cruel husband, but the reader can see through his mechanisms and vicious words to the man desperate to push away any hint of caring or love. However, despite the fact that we're told Sebastian was unloved as he was growing up, we still don't see a lot of the reasons as to why he pushes Evie away repeatedly, though his fascination and affection for her are shown pretty early on. Perhaps it is as one of the secondary characters says: Evie is his ultimate fantasy - the good girl he could never hope to obtain.<br /><br />On that note, Evie is as sweet and innocent as they come, with a thread of steel in her backbone that makes her able to handle everything Sebastian dishes. At times, Kleypas pushes Evie's innocence and naivet&eacute; a little too far, but by the end of the book, Evie develops a strong enough backbone and becomes a strong enough character that you admire her and the decisions she makes. However, readers who don't care for the super-innocent heroine may want to pick up a copy at the library before deciding to buy this book.<br /><br />One of the finer touches that Kleypas puts into Devil in Winter is Sebastian's growing sense of responsibility (while first fueled by a hint of greed for money, eventually turns to ownership and pride in what he's doing) with Evie's father's gambling club. From the moment he steps into the club, Kleypas slowly reveals Sebastian's growth as a business owner, and his aptitude for business. You have to admire him as he finds purpose in his life. Kleypas also doesn't allow herself to drag out the whole \\"no sex after the wedding night\\" deal too far or too long. Many books with this plotline mistakenly draw it out so far that you become bored with the varied sexual misses. Instead, she uses it to slowly fuel the sexual atmosphere, but doesn't push it too far before the h/h give in to the mutual desire.<br /><br />I enjoyed this Kleypas much more than the last 6 or 8 books she's put out. It's reminiscent of her earlier books, though definitely sexed up a lot more, but with a h/h I enjoyed reading and learning about. It could have used more backstory on their families to help round out the characters more. But in all, I'd recommend this to any historical romance reader.nnocence and naivet a little too far, but by the end of the book, Evie develops a strong enough backbone and becomes a strong enough character that you admire her and the decisions she makes.

B000B8QG4A|5.0|Rightfully heralded as one of Disney's best movies, LADY AND THE TRAMP is marvelously restored in this 50 year anniversary edition.  The colors are sumptious, the sound superb, and it just reminds me of when I saw this movie as a child just how great these early animated efforts truly were.  The endearing spaghetti BELLA NOTTE sequence is more lovely than ever; those evil little Siamese cats and there WE ARE SIAMESE tune even more devilishly clever. And Peggy Lee's HE'S A TRAMP is still doggone great!  All the characters, from Trusty to Jock to Jim Dear and Darling never looked better.  This is truly a film all families should share together; in view of today's CGI animation (which is mindboggling to say the least), this old fashioned animation is just as much fun to revel in!

B00005JOII|3.0|The emptiness at the heart of the protagonists marks this very much as a Woody Allen film.  They, just like the characters portrayed by Allen himself in other films, search art for a moral compass, a compass which they innately lack and which they fear has been lost with the disappearance of religious faith.  In a secular world, Dostoevsky, Sophocles, the visual arts, and Verdi's operas become the territory in which meaning and justice are sought.  While sought, they are not found.  The protagonists see the morality and emotion evident in these works of art, and indeed they see a moral order and emotional bonds in the real people around them, yet they do not feel themselves part of this.  They are not bound as they cannot empathise.  So what they find does not strike them as authentic or authoratative - they remain lost, and without a genuine sense of a cohesive self. <br />* <br />In his funny films it's easy to ignore the empty core of the protagonist - usually a stream of hilarious one-liners offer a disguise as effective as his glaucous horn-rimmed spectacles.  Woody projects the face of a sad clown - a clown that is truly dead-pan, with no real emotion ever creasing his face.  In 'Match Point' Jonathan Rhys Meyers is similarly dead-pan, but to no humorous purpose.  His is the good-looking charm that is a comfort to those around him - they can project their own wishes onto his blank screen.  Thus Emily Mortimer's Chloe can see him as a protege to her own father, along with being her husband and provider of children.  Brian Cox as Alec, Chloe's father and mogul, sees a dependable son-in-law.  Nobody cares to pierce the attractive surface and investigate the chaotic void within - even Chris himself is reluctant to dwell on his own motivations, yet in Johansson's Nola he sees an inadvertant window into a soul not unlike his own, and Nola's reaction suggests a degree of reciprocity - they dive headlong into each other, thinking like Narcissus that they are seeing another being, when in reality they can only see themselves.  As in so many Allen films the female love interest is depicted as in some sense mentally unbalanced.  This can, and often is, read as simple misogyny;  yet perhaps it falls to the woman to dramatise the inner torment of the male lead - just as Chris Wilton can't master, or even bear scrutinising, his own demons, so Woody casts his into the female roles he writes - one can call this swinish, but it is so in the Biblical sense as well as the chauvinistic. <br />* <br />Both Meyer's and Johansson's characters cannot love.  Lust and the quest for worldly approval they can muster, but not love.  Again in an Allen paradigm, they cannot develop a relationship beyond the initial sex-driven courtship.  When forced to do so by pragmatic concerns, in this case Meyer's need to secure wealth and privilege through marriage, the experience becomes dulled and alien.  Meyer's Chris can see the emotion alive between the Hewett family members, but he views this as a spectator, through a metaphorical pane of glass - and he is not so much envious as baffled, bewildered by the fact that he cannot feel emotion in the way they do.   <br />* <br />To be cursed by such an incapacity of feeling and such a fractured sense of self can be a torment.  In the psychiatric literature, which Allen might well be familiar with, these disorders are sometimes attributed to a deprivation of unconditional love and of affirmation during certain stages of childhood development (the film does not have space to explore these causes, but mention is made of family traumas, particularly on Nola's side).  Unsurprisingly, those afflicted often have troubled interpersonal relationships, and some seek professional help - with varying degrees of benefit.  In the film, it is possible to think of the startling denouement as Chris Wilton's attempt to rid himself of his own inner torment - of course a literal interpretation, in terms of the mechanics of the plot,is also sustained - the apparent emotion he displays in the wake of this might be taken as grief for the loss of a part of himself, as literal self-destruction.  The idea that Chris does not differentiate himself fully from Nola, that they are in a distorted sense two aspects of one being, could also stand a Jungian reading - although I'm not sure it would be very illuminating.  <br />* <br />'Match Point' also has a riff on luck's part in life.  It adds a little to the narrative, but not much.  More interesting is the strange perspective from which the English class system is viewed.  The whole upper class scene is viewed as at once removed from the world and deeply exploitative of it - as patrons of the arts the Hewetts have no direct experience of the suffering depicted in the works which they sponsor and view.  Allen has transplanted the affluent New York scene, which he knows well, and dressed it in British trimmings - this should not work, but the extent to which it does emphasizes the point that all privilege commits similar sins.  In any case, the country manors and exclusive tennis clubs and rich drapery give the film a slick sheen. <br />* <br />As cinema, 'Match Point' is a cold experience.  The loveless characters are difficult to love in turn.  As a dramatisation of psychopathology it is well done, and can be seen as an extension of 'Melinda and Melinda'.  Still, I find Woody in this mood a bitter pill - a few laughs make his misguided existential vacuum a bit less black.  The funniest thing about the film is Chris Wilton's non-existent footwork on the tennis court (followed closely by his forehand).
1400079276|4.0|This is the first Murakami novel I have read. I liked his short stories I read in the New Yorker and initially and periodically I was disappointed with the novel, tried to put it down more than once, parts of it were boring, the prose was pedestrian, the work seemed more like a comic book than a novel, I got tired of long descriptive passages, I didn't like the lectures, I wondered about all the product placement, like ads, but I plowed on. I tossed it in the trash and then retrieved it, there was something drawing me to it, maybe the mystery of life. I finally finished it, didn't care for the ending, but couldn't imagine how to end something like this. I didn't want to like this novel, I generally don't like fantasy although I like good science fiction. And when I was finished with it I threw it in the trash again! It's like I was having a love affair with this book and was going through all the stages, romance, disillusion, desire, and reality, no one and nothing will ever live up to our expectations and this book didn't either, and yet, after I finished it I couldn't get it our of my mind. I felt like I was a character in the novel living the same kind of hallucinatory reality, not being able to make sense out of anything, dreaming in a waking state. If that is any indication of the success of this work than it succeeded infiltrating my consciousness and taking possession of me. I think I have found a potato chip author, I have to have another one and will probably have to read everything he's wrote. Not that I'll like it, I'll muse and grumble about him, his simple minded philosophy, his lack of genuine erudition, his poor writing style, grade school level. I will think of Jerzy Kosinski and Marquez, and Lewis Carrol all far superior writers, I will resent Murakami's immense success, but I will probably go on and read everything he's wrote and for the life of me I won't know why. I have been hypnotized--isn't that what life's all about?
B00000DHRX|5.0|This 2CD set collects just about every successful song by leading British 80's/90's pop star George Michael. It is excellent value, as you get 29 songs on two discs, nearly all of which were chart hits between 1984  and the release date of November 1998. <br /> <br />This set is definitely worth 5 stars !!! <br /> <br />George Michael was so popular because he had an excellent singing voice, could write beautiful slow ballads as well as funky, sensual grooves, and had a nice way with emotive lyrics. Everything he touched turned to platinum in the 15 years covered by this set. <br /> <br />Here are just a few standout GM tracks: <br /> <br />You Have Been Loved - Superb sensitive and heartrending slow tune about the demise of a close friend. Simply beautiful. <br /> <br />Faith - Snappy, irresistible 3 minute pop song went to #1 everywhere. One of his best career hits <br /> <br />Freedom '90 - Really groovy , funky track with lyrics that tell the tale of George's ascent to stardom and his early 90's decision to skip the popstar limelight for a more authentic singer-songwriter persona. Excellent. <br /> <br />As - I love this duet cover version of Stevie Wonder's great song , featuring US soul singer Mary J. Blige. Excellent vocal pairing. This song was George's last 90's hit. <br /> <br />Praying For Time - Slow paced serious tune from the Listen Without Prejudice album in 1990. Really good lyrics. <br /> <br />Careless Whisper - Hit #1 in September 1984 at a time when George was riding a huge wave of popstar adulation as part of Wham! A regretful love song with a super saxophone bit in it, that I have always really liked. This song was at #1 on the Australian chart the very first week I ever listened to our local radio chart countdown, so I remember it well. <br /> <br />Outside - George goes disco and liberates himself from a mid 90's career hiatus with this stomping 1998 chart hit.  <br /> <br />One More Try - Soulful power ballad . George proved here what a soulful voice he has , and this went high on the US R&B charts in 1988 - a rare feat for a white European performer. <br /> <br />The Strangest Thing - I really like this 1996 song from the Older album. Intriguing lyrics and a melancholy feel but a great track. <br /> <br />I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me) - Worldwide 1987 #1 hit with Aretha Franklin providing the soul and George carrying on with his unstoppable popstar form. A nice song. <br /> <br />A Different Corner - This was George's first real solo tune and it is marvellous and is a really heartfelt sentiment. A beautiful song, this personal ballad reached #4 on the charts in June 1986. <br /> <br />Jesus To A Child - An elegy to a deceased partner, this graceful tribute made the #1 position in January 1996 - the first new GM record for over 3 years. It marked the end of his self-imposed exile while his court battle with Sony was played out.  <br /> <br />Fastlove - Mid-paced sensual groove that was George's 6th and, to date, final Australian #1 hit in May 1996. A cruisy ode to 90's romantic hedonists, it samples 1982 hit Forget Me Nots (Patrice Rushen).  <br /> <br />Star People - George trashes vain, self-obsessed celebrities on this 1997 hit off the Older album, and supplies a groovy funk beat. <br /> <br />Fantasy - Little known 1990 B-side gets a remix and new production for this set, and is a danceable funk tune that I always liked. <br /> <br />Father Figure - US #1 hit tune from the Faith album that was a lyrical and melodic winner for George in his Grammy award winning annus mirabilis of 1988. <br /> <br />Kissing A Fool - Delightful jazz-influenced melodic track with excellent vocals from George. The 6th (!!!) hit singe from the Faith album, it hit US #5.  <br /> <br />There are plenty of other good GM album tracks I 'm not going to talk about here - try his other 5 studio albums out to hear them. Suffice to say that if you like George's music, you should definitely own a copy of \\"Ladies And Gentlemen\\"if you don't already !!
6305263248|4.0|Agree with the other reviewers comments on the acting, the car chase realism, etc. <br /> <br />The scenery around Nice and Villefranche sur mer is wonderful to look at.  The director's commentary on the DVD is actually educational as, among many other things, he discusses the difficulties of showing small passages of time in a movie, issues of framing scenes, and test audience reaction to the various endings. <br /> <br />There is also just a lot that happens in this movie, you might think that it was three or four hours long. <br /> <br />There is a realism about this movie that most spy thrillers lack.  There is a nice sub-text going on critiquing the gung ho, invade first plan later approach to violence with a more experienced, careful approach. <br /> <br />And, on top of all else, there are a handful of marvelous one-liners in here as well.  Punk trying to show off: \\"You ever kill anyone?\\"  DeNiro: (dismissively) \\"I hurt somebody's feelings once.\\"
B0007OY2MG|5.0|That's right, I'm a guy. And I like this show. For the record, let me state that I didn't always like it, in fact, I honestly despised the show. But my wife loves it, and being whipped as most guys who wear the handcuff that is a wedding ring are I bought it for her for xmas, starting with season 1. Somehow she convinced me to watch the first few episodes with her, and I found I wasn't miserable. Every time before when she had turned the show on while it was on TV I grapped my laptop and headphones and watched some DVD with blood, gore, and explosions, as any normal guy would. But watching the show from the beginning actually got interesting. I found myself getting pissed off when Dean breaks up with Rory, and later on when... actually, no spoilers, lets just say a perfect relationship gets screwed up by the wrong person getting pregnant. So, for all you guys who hate all the luvy-dubby TV shows that your wife or girlfriend undoubtedly try to get you to watch, I'm telling you, buy this show, STARTING WITH SEASON 1. I can't stress that enough, if you start in the middle of the series you will find it to be crap and hate it and me for writing this review, and I really don't want anyone to blame me for taking any time out of their lives. But if you buy it, your significant other will thank you and be amazed as you actually sit through an entire chick show with her without wanting to stab your eyes out from sheer boredom. Believe me, you'll like it. And who can argue with brownie points from the wifey for doing something you'll enjoy?

B000E0OBK6|5.0|Jarhead isn't your typical combat action-war film. In fact it's probably the most unconventional war drama out there. There are no scenes of action, combat, or firefights, and you'd think that that would make Jarhead a boring and uninteresting war film. Well the answer is strangely No. Jarhead does have a moment or two where boredom settles in briefly, but the film is never really uninteresting. The film is based on the book, of the same title, written by former Marine Anthony Swofford (played here by Jake Gyllenhaal). Anthony enlists in the Marines hoping to make something out of himself. He goes through basic training; where he practices and becomes a top ranking sniper. He develops a \\"taste\\" for what they call the \\"pink mist\\", that's a head shot, or kill shot for those of you who were wondering.<br /><br />Once he and his platoon are finished with Basic they're shipped off to Saudi Arabia where they wait for action... and then they wait some more, and then some more. The lack of action and the soldier's lust to \\"get some\\" is eating them up inside. They're bored, and they've been highly and thoroughly trained for combat, but the waiting game is killing them. The war is being mostly fought and won by the \\"zoomies\\" (that's what the Marines call fighter jets). The soldier's are not only suffering from boredom, but also from sexual frustration. They all wonder if their girlfriends are cheating on them, or will dump them. They seem to have very little belief that they'll remain faithful to them while they're away at war, and a couple of them aren't, as can clearly be seen in one particularly shocking scene. There's also another pretty shocking nightmare scene that puts the Nirvana song Something in the Way to great use.<br /><br />Jarhead is less about fighting a war, and more about a soldier's mental state while at war, especially when dealing with the itching nerve to want to be in the middle of combat putting your skills to the test. It can drive some men mad. Jarhead isn't about politics, it's about men, not exactly soldiers (they're men first, soldiers second). The first half of Jarhead is almost a comedy, with a number of goofy moments and dark humor. Then the film slides into the surreal as men are riding on the edge of battle. The scenes with the burning oil fields is darkly haunting and at the same time beautiful. Jarhead isn't Black Hawk Down, it isn't a film about diving into chaos and rescuing your buddy, it's about the way men are in the places and situations of war. The film delivers a number of strong performances from good actors surrounding Gyllenhaal, like Jamie Foxx as Staff Sgt. Sykes (he plays his role very realistically and funny) and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy, Swofford's closest friend.<br /><br />Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road to Perdition) has created the first real war film that fully immerses the viewer in what it's really like to be a soldier, but surprisingly without any combat, and somehow it still succeeds. I should also mention the film's score by Thomas Newman, like all of his scores, is absolutely sensational, and really helps set the tone and rhythm. The film's unrestraint, unflinching look at male soldiers is strangely unique and fascinating. Most war films have a particular message to tell you, in Saving Private Ryan it was the shocking brutality of war, and in Black Hawk Down it was what drives men to go into dangerous, chaotic situations, but in Jarhead I'm not so sure there's a message to learn. Jarhead is more like real life, it's pointless, and it's more of an experience and a state of mind than a lesson. It's a story about men in uniform, and the uniform doesn't change anything, they're still a man underneath. If Mendes has said anything in Jarhead it's \\"once a solider, always a solider\\". You take those experiences with you, and no matter what you do with the rest of your life you'll always be a soldier. The main thing I said to myself after watching Jarhead was, \\"Well, thatwas surprisingly different... and good.\\" And sometimes different is all a film really needs to be in order to work, and Jarhead works. This is one of my favorite films of the year, and one of my favorite war films, right along side Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down., that was surprisingly different... and good.\\" And sometimes different is all a film really needs to be in order to work, and Jarhead works.

0743454537|4.0|I found this to be a very readable, very interesting book. Perhaps my own life entrenched next to my mother, watching her go in and out of hospitals, in and out of treatments and transplants and so on, helped taint my liking for this book a little, but it remains decent. <br /> <br />The book has a very basic plotline: Anna, sick of being poked, prodded, stuck, and hospitalized -- and otherwise ignored by her parents -- seeks out an attorney to declare herself medically emancipated from her parents. The story is told from the point of view of Anna, her mother, father, delinquent brother, attorney, and guardian ad litem (who just happens to be her attorney's ex-girlfriend, of course!). Not once do you hear the voice of Kate, the dying sister -- until the last pages of the book. <br /> <br />Despite everything else I'm going to say, I found myself really enmeshed in the characters. I liked Anna, applauded her, wanted to slap her.... pretty much the way an adult feels about any 13-year-old. I felt for Kate, obviously, and all the medical problems that plague her body -- but I also felt for Anna and Jesse, the two kids often left forgotten in the wake of the latest medical crisis. Despite how much I disliked their decisions, disapproved of how they treated the other children, I also felt sympathy for the parents of these children, Sara and Brian. <br /> <br />The book explored the large range of emotions each character goes through -- the dawning understanding of the parents that they no longer have anything to talk about except their daughter's illness, the \\"acting out\\" of the brother Jesse, since that's the only way he gets any attention, to the time spent when Anna and her father just sit and watch the stars. <br /> <br />I have two issues with the book, however. The first is sheer length -- the book seemed stretched sometimes, like taffy, making it longer but leaving it with less substance to cover the occasional melodrama or confusion. The second is the ending. I don't dislike the ending, but I'm very mixed in my emotions. I spent so long reading the whole buildup of the book and I realize that, while real life would *never* have ended the way this book ended, but in the book, it was oddly satisfactory. Unlike life, the book had a final measure of closure not found. <br /> <br />If you have the time, I reccommend reading the book, despite my lukewarm rating. I did enjoy it -- but I have no intention of reading it again.
0345457684|4.0|Not a bad neo-cyberpunk story, not high art. Overall I would rate it as good mind candy for when you are in the mood for a reasonably well written story that won't make you think too deeply.
0307276902|4.0|Although I thought the book ran a little to smoothly, I enjoyed the ending. I thought things were working out just a little to easily for Mr. Fray. I was satisfied at the end. I recommend reading this book to anyone who wants positive inspiration in their life.
0060594888|5.0|I checked this book out from local library and then did not read it while I was gone on Hurricane Katrina evacuation. I started to return it unread after 3 months, but decided to skim the table of contents--I WAS HOOKED!  It is the most profound single book I have ever read.  I am reading it for the 4th time in 2 months and this time with notebook and pen in hand to put it into practice.  I am giving it to all the members of my immediate family (spouse and 4 teenage children) in hopes they will let it change them as it has affected me.<br /><br />I have given it to several of my peers who are in mid-life and needing both a  sense of direction and hope.  It is working for them as well.  The youngest person I have reading it is 11 and the oldest is 73!<br /><br />I have begun a Master Mind group and they are all reading the book as well.  My next project is to get multiple copies into every public shool library in the area.<br /><br />I commend this book to everyone.
B000E97X66|5.0|Finally a Springsteen live set actually worth the price of admission.  So far we have \\"Live/1975-1985,\\" which, despite its husk, is quite uneven.  Then we have a spate of 90s (\\"MTV Plugged\\") and 00s (\\"Live in New York City\\") concert albums which present the \\"grown up\\" Springsteen, nowhere near as ebullient as he was purported to be back in his \\"Born to Run\\"/\\"Darkness at the Edge of Town\\" heyday. <br /> <br />Fresh off the recording and release of the \\"Born to Run\\" album, Springsteen and the E Street Band play inspired music here.  Each instrumentalist shines.  The best thing about this release, especially for people just dabbling into Springsteen's more obscure material, is it shows just how great a guitarist he can be.  Tracks like the \\"E Street Shuffle\\" and \\"Kitty's Back\\" show their ability to play tightly and loose at the same time, something I'm sure a group like the Dave Matthews Band would be jealous of.  The \\"Born to Run\\" material is really focused, with \\"Jungleland\\" being the stand out. <br /> <br />This disc is recommended for anybody whose tired of being disappointed by all the hype surrounding Springsteen's live shows and the uneven official releases documenting them.  \\"Hammersmith Odeon London '75\\" is the real deal.  If you like this and have some extra money to spend, get the \\"Born to Run\\" 30th Anniversary set, which includes this performance on DVD.
B000000LZV|5.0|Revolutionary, political, raw and mostly clocking in at a minute each. This is as funky and chaotic as anything else released by the trio. Watt, Hurley, and Boon have perfected their chemistry on this outing and it shows with the 74 magical minutes this release offers. This is actually a good place to start for those unfamiliar with the trio as it keeps your attention throughout. I might also recommend \\"Introducing the Minutemen\\" as a starter. Then again, you may find yourself spending a small fortune once you check this one out, in which case the \\"Post Mersh Volumes 1-3\\" would make an excellent anthology.
B000001DTM|5.0|Ok, this is going to be the most dramatic, emotional, different, and cheesiest review you'll ever see me write; but I mean every last word. Achtng Baby: where U2 was at their finest, where they showed the world that they could do the unbelievable, where they showed that a bands' finest work is often their most underrated masterpiece(like Yes's Relayer). I can use all the fancy adjectives I want, but they will never explain how incredible Achtng Baby truly and really is.<br /><br /> What is it that makes Achtung Baby really stand out and above all the other U2 albums? For one thing, it was where each member got to show how talented all four of them were. The Edge already proved what he could do with the guitar on The Joshua Tree(in my opinion), but this is where he placed himself as one of the 10 best guitar players EVER. Bono wasn't an oustanding singer in U2's beginning(it was U2's energy on stage that got them started), but with each record he managed to improve. Thanks to Achtung Baby, he made his voice one of the most recognizable voices in rock. Adam was a very crappy bassist in the beginning, but like with Bono's singing, he managed to improve with the passing of each new album; but on achtung Baby, he proved how amazing he's gotten. Larry-well, let's face it-is a pretty terrible drummer, but he seem to improve a little on this album. All of this makes Achtung Baby amazing. This and the song quality.<br /><br /> Zoo Station blew me away after I heard it, and even though I wanted to hear it again, I felt it was better that I just listen to the rest of the songs. After every song, I kept wanting more and more. Even Better Than the Real thing was also incredible, if not as outstanding as Zoo Station, but still great. Song after song whirlwinded me into a state of awe and amazement. I couldn't get over how oustanding and beautiful it was. Achtung Baby is not only the U2 at their finest moments, but it is one of the best rock records that ever were. It's not challenging or hard to listen to, it's just great. Every minute is U2 that you wish you could hear in every record.<br /><br /> What interests me hear is how underrated Achtung Baby is. Don't get me wrong, The Joshua Tree was great, but compare it to this masterpiece? Don't even go there! If you think about it, a band's best album is usually their most underrated. Think about it: Yes~Relayer, Santana~Moonflower, Nirvana~In Utero, Joni Mitchell~Court And Spark, and U2~Achtung Baby. These were all artistic masterpieces that got nowhere near as much credit as they deserved.<br /><br /> Zoo Station, mysterious Ways, Ultra Violet, So cruel, and all of the songs for that matter are amazing. Each and every second of Achtung Baby is genuine beauty that you'll never hear in any other record. You must get this right away. it is a work of art that belongs in everyone's collection. Do you have good taste in music and don't own this? Then you need to slap yourself, grab some cash, go to the nearest Target, and by Achtung Baby-NOW.<br /><br /> Sadly, however, in my opinion, this is the last outstanding and really great U2 album. Everything after it is unfocused and boring(although, with a few good moments here and there).to listen to, it's just great. Every minute is U2 that you wish you could hear in every record.

B000002U82|5.0|Simply brilliant. Why else would it be one of the top selling albums ever?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Witty dialogue, well developed, 3-D characters, a great story, adventure, and cursing in Chinese.  What more could you ask for?
B000001DWG|5.0|The genius of Mother Love Bone cannot be underestimated, the beauty of singer/lyricist/poet Andrew Wood's timeless lyrics and over the top but excellent vocal delivery combined with Stone Gossards amazing riffs and Jeff Aments incredibly groovy basslines make this a lost treasure from the magical decade known as the 90's.     Its just an utter tragedy Andy Wood didn't live on and fulfill his destiny as Gen-X's Robert Plant, yes, the band had the potential to be that good, with hardrockers \\"This is Shangri-La\\", \\"Come Bite The Apple, Capricorn Sister\\" to soul wrenching ballads like \\"Bone China\\", \\"Stargazer\\", \\"Man of Golden Words\\" and of course, the immaculate \\"Crown of Thorns\\".     It was obvious this band was set to become a huge commodity as the decade began and subsequently would have went on to even greater fame as part of the \\"seattle four\\" when Nirvana changed the perception of Alternative rock forever and brought Seattle based rock bands mainstream.     Unfortunately, things didn't work out that way as Wood was found dead in his apartment from a fatal heroin overdose a month before the release of their debut LP \\"Apple\\", thus ending what would have been one of the most important bands of the generation, and beginning the start of the 90's biggest north american rock n' roll band, Pearl Jam(though i love Pearl Jam just as much and i recommend Ten just as much). \\"Stardog Champion\\" offers you the complete MLB package, as it contains the Apple LP as well as a few bonus tracks and the Shine EP.     Its such a shame things ended the way they did, Andrew was a man who had the charisma and lyrical prowess to go as far as he wanted, and would have been an instrumental figure in Gen-X as an almost poet of sorts, in the vain of Jim Morrison, just someone who believed in the philosophy love and poetry, bottom line, pick this up, i cannot praise this album enough, light years better than the garbage thats being passed off as \\"genius\\" today (Green Day, Nickelback, Coldplay, Arcade Fire etc.) Its just a shame, there was still so much more music left to write.     HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION
078322608X|5.0|This film is essentially based on the absurd idea of time, the idea that time is real, a dimension, which could be travelled through. The NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory, a major part of superultramodern science, suggests that time, like space, is not real, but is rather a mere form of illusion to non-spatial mind. Present is an experience whose physical/material bases are non-spatial feelings. Past, like space and time, is a mere feeling; not any concrete reality existing on its own. To be precise, past is a feeling I have that I felt/had it before. I can't even be sure that something happened in the past. Maybe it's just my feeling in the present, where present is also a feeling. Getting into the past therefore means having the right ideas (that would also exist as non-spatial feelings) that conceptually correspond to the past. And the means to do this is to, at least partly, investigate the design of the universe (probably written in the form of some central superhuman thoughts existing as non-spatial feelings) by say meditation. The film is thus flawed based on a flawed scientific idea. But still I rate this film 5 star as it is thought- provoking and may lead one to superultramodern science and deeper philosophical/scientific problems.         <br /> <br />
0451527046|5.0|This book was a good book, but I would only recommend it to middle-schoolers because the plot and sentence structure is complicated. The words Robert Louis Stevenson used in this book were old English and hard to understand. In the book, he used a lot of sailing terms like yard, riggings, hull, bow, etc. He wrote using a lot of description. A picture of whatever he was talking about popped up in your mind. Some significant events in this book were gunfights, fist fights, and mystery. The climax in the book comes relatively early and if you like a lot of action, you should read this book. <br />   I gave this book five stars because I like action early in a book. All of the action starts in the middle of the book unlike some others where the action waits for the last pages. In Treasure Island when there is no action the story turns to a mystery. The mystery part in this book is mostly trying to find out why people kill other people. The main character, Hawkins, is a young boy that is seeking adventure and fortune. He is very brave and towards the end grows up into an adult. All in all I recommend this book to anyone who can get their hands on it.

B000035Z1Z|5.0|What is a romantic comedy without Meg Ryan?  Not quite the same and that is why \\"French Kiss\\" works.  Meg's character of Kate is very similar to her Sally Albright of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" - - very stiff, predictable, a bit standoffish and definitely proper.  With another actress playing either part, the character might not garner much sympathy.  And if the audience does not like Kate (or Sally, for that matter), the movie simply would not work.   <br />Fortunately, Meg is made for Kate.  Her inate cuteness makes her a very likable character, and despite seeing her flaws early in the film, you just KNOW that she has something special under her skin, just waiting for the right person to bring it out. <br />Which is definitely and obviously not Charlie (Timothy Hutton), her staid fiance, who leaves on a business trip to Paris without her (she suffers a tremendous fear of flying) and before you can say \\"viva la France\\", he promptly falls in love with the French and lovely Juliette, who apparently has nothing to do but walk around as Charlie's arm candy.  Charlie calls Kate to break off their engagement and despondent, she forces herself to fly to Paris, desperate to save their relationship.  En route, she encounters Luc (brilliantly played by the extraordinary Kevin Kline), a French thief, returning to Paris with the intention to use an unwitting Kate as his mule.  Having her luggage stolen requires Kate to join forces with Luc (she, to find Charlie and woo him back; he, to find her stolen luggage and keep an eye on his smuggled goods).  As they travel through France, with Luc instructing Kate on how to win Charlie back and lighten up, and trying to outrun and outsmart the French police, lead by Jean Reno, Kate begins to rethink where her affections lie. <br />All in all, I absolutely LOVE this movie!  Kevin Kline is wonderful, as always, and he and Meg Ryan have a genuine chemistry and affection.  This is a feel good film, a light romantic comedy with stunning and beautiful scenery.  If you love France, this is a gorgeous love letter to the country. <br />As an added bonus, the soundtrack is equally as fabulous. <br />Highly recommended. <br />
B000E1MTXQ|4.0|The pluses outweigh the minuses in \\"The Bourne Supremacy,\\" which is a good thing because both sides of the scale here are pretty significant. I am not sure if the credit for the pluses goes more to novelist Robert Ludlum for the novel \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" or to Tony Gilroy for the screenplay, but I know that the writing is the best part of this summer 2004 thriller. I have not read any of Ludlum's books, but I know Gilroy did the adaptation of \\"Dolores Claiborne,\\" so it could be either of them. I also know that the parts of the film that take away from \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" can be laid at the feet of director Paul Greengrass.<br /><br />The one thing we know about a Jason Bourne film, as opposed to a James Bond film, is that somebody is always out to see him dead. Bond as least has a mission that has people trying to kill him; Bourne is on a hit list just by breathing. Matt Damon plays Bourne with a understatement that marks him apart from the rest of his secret agent brethren, and which also serves to emphasize the strength of the script. Introduced to the character as a badly wounded body floating in the Mediterranean who did not remember who he was, Bourne survived his first film never finding out his real name, just his identity as Jason Bourne, and dropped off the face of the earth to try and live happily ever after with Marie (Franka Potente), his unwilling ally and now only confidante.<br /><br />Of course, they are doomed, and Bourne goes off to get the people who are trying to get him. This becomes somewhat confusing because the people out to get him on one continent are not same people trying to get him on all the other ones. But the important thing is that Bourne goes off to deliver payback and what is great about this character is his economy of effort. Jason Bourne can create a time bomb in thirty seconds using only three things and in his hands a bottle of vodka has a multitude of uses. Every time he gets into a sticky situation you know he is going to doing something smart and he is going to do it quickly. The intelligence of the character and the script is the strongest part of the movie.<br /><br />But at the same time the script is delighting my brain director Paul Greengrass is trying to turn my stomach. Too much of this film is done by a hand-held camera, rarely to any great effect. Then there are the smash cuts and heavy editing of the fight scenes. What is the good of choreographing a one-on-one fight scene if all we get are quick impressions of what is going on. Then Greengrass starts throwing things together, so that we have hand-held shots of moving people cut at warp speed. This gets a bit disorienting at times and can provoke feelings of queasiness. But Bourne's intelligence overcome these visual liabilities.<br /><br />Bourne is also the smartest person in the film, something it take CIA station chief Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) a while to understand, even though Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nicolette (Julia Stiles) both explain this to her repeatedly. The end game of the film actually has a series of levels, so that it is not a simple thing to get everything resolved, and Bourne does have a hand in everything that happens. There is a strong thread of realism going throughout the impossible situations, but that is why the future of the Bourne series is different from the fate of the Bond flicks. \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" also gets points for the scenes in the movie that we see in the trailer are better in the movie than they are when cut together in the trailer.going to doing something smart and he is going to do it quickly.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Being a Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and other prog rock fan, as well as modern alt rock, Radiohead was a natural progression for me, and OK Computer is where I started. <br /> <br />All I can say is wow. While no track in particular, besides the awesome guitars of \\"Electioneering\\" stands out for me, the album as a whole is a brilliant polished piece of work. 5 stars.

It seems it does, as the ship breaks apart, and Jim says those immortal words \\"Houston, we have a problem.\\" The film has a brilliant cast, especially from Ed Harris, and wonderful direction by Ron Howard (who was snubbed an Oscar nomination). This is something to check out because you might learn something. Not just about space travel, but a lot of important things like a group of brave astronauts and...This is starting to drift away from becoming a film review. Anyway, this is a wonderful film that you should see.
1582432678|5.0|I just finished reading \\"We Need to Talk about Kevin\\" and had to fight an instinct to look for an article on Kevin and Eva on the Internet. That's how real this book is. The clarity of the author's voice, the progression of events and the tone of the novel are structured so perfectly that it's almost as though you are reading someone's long ago abandoned diary with yellowed pages. What makes this book so powerful is that it unflinchingly takes you to a dark place and confront the painful and, yes, helpless reality of what these character's are facing. But when you get through this emotional roller coaster, you feel incredibly rewarded to know that there is a novel this well written out there on the bookshelves. <br /> <br />Some have criticized the fact that Franklin seems so passive in light of the horrible things his son is doing. But people who make those criticisms should ask themselves whether, when faced with the option of facing up to the evil things their child is doing or simply refusing to accept them, they would not make the same choice. As for the big climax, this is one thing in the book that I feel was a mistake. It was unnecessary and the author would have achieved her vision without it. I think the most heartbreaking and brilliant part of the novel are the last four pages. I don't usually reread books, but I read these last few pages several times because they were so poignant and combined together so many emotions: pity, despair, hopelessness, forgiveness and even hope. I've only cried at the ending of two books: one was by Ernest Hemingway. The other was by Lionel Shriver.
B00005JNTX|3.0|I expected a lot of this movie. There were great reviews, fantastic previews etc. But when I saw the film, I was a bit dissapointed.  <br /> <br />First the good parts of the film: The style of the film, and the black and white colouring with some highlights in colour are maqnificent to look at and gives a fantastic feel to the movie. You really feel like you are watching the comic book by Frank Miller. So if you love the comic, this movie is for you. <br />Then the actors do a fine job, a great starcast is on board. <br />The stories that are told in the film are cool onces and very interesting. You are wondering how they will end and what will happen to the characters. <br /> <br />But then, Sin City is really the biggest gore movie I have ever seen. This is the first time I can say the following of a movie:  <br />It defenitly deserves it's R rating. <br />It has got everything: Blood, body parts flying around, nudity, excecutions, beheadings, murders, hookers, strippers, action, sex, you name it, Sin City has it. <br /> <br />So all in all, this movie is entertaining, but beware:  <br />This movie is defenitly not for the onces who have a weak stomach. <br />
B000A2XC1C|4.0|This is one of the 10 best family holiday movies of all time! Not brilliantly written, but wonderfully entertaining. Dudley Moore plays an ambitious, but naive Elf who is easily manipulated and taken advantage of. Moore has the uncanny ability to be both heartwarming, and pathetic, to a level few other actors can attain. John Lithgow is at his maniacal best as the evil-hearted New York industrialist-toymaker who exploits Moore's Elfin character to near disaster. David Huddleston is genuine and loveable as \\"The Big Guy\\", Santa himself! <br />In the first half of the film we get to see how Claus was chosen by the Elves for his immortal role. The sets and costumes take you to the rich and beleivable fantasy world of Santa's workshop in the frozen north. <br />The second half of the film is set in modern New York City. The contrast is obvious, and sets up a tender subplot about a young boy who lives on the street, and a young girl whose heart is rapt in the spirit of the season.  <br />Can Santa come to his friend's rescue? Can he thwart the plans of the evil industrialist in time to save Christmas? (Remember, this is a \\"family\\" picture!) <br />Sit back and enjoy some Christmas fun!
0312995423|4.0|This is the first of his works that I have read.  I know...I know...The Da Vinci Code is supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread, but I just wasn't buying into the hype.

His fat fingers groped every inch of her body.  She fell on top of him and moaned and writhed in false ecstasy.

I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I absolutely devoured this book.  I actually took away from my writing time so that I could read.  Those of you who know me will realize the importance of that statement.  I wouldn't say that I am exactly OCD, but I do like to keep a fairly rigorous schedule.

B000BJS4SU|1.0|This CD is wrongly titled - The \\"star\\" is Steve Jordan and his drumming.  His drumming is always so perfect for the situation (even this one...) and the pop of his snare is the coolest.<br /><br />If you didn't have to listen to John Mayer's voice and those goofy lyrics I'd given it more stars.<br /><br />Mayer has certainly spent his time woodshedding on the guitar, but it just seems like his stuff is being regurgitated by a guy in a lab coat.  His playing and tones are just lifted from far more interesting players that were plugged into something that Mayer doesn't seem to have.<br /><br />Listen to his between song banter - it is laughable.  After the \\"bluesier\\" numbers - he talks just like Stevie Ray.  I think he is from the east coast, but he suddenly seems to pull up some form of humble Texas drawl.  He comes across as an impersonator that just mirrors the originals without any self identity.<br /><br />However, based upon the apparent age of the school girls screaming between the songs - they were born after SRV's death and believing Mayer is some unique talent with something new to say.

It is one of my all time favorite movies...If you think it starts out too slow, remember that Persuasion is considered Jane Austen's most mature writing--this is real story telling.  Be patient, pay attention, and this will be your favorite too.  Just a note to parents--this movie is suitable for viewers of all ages--clean and beautiful, just like the book.

I really can not explain it very well, and I usually write track-by-track reviews (check them out - they are essays). Although I will say that myself and \\"The Dreaming\\" have had some very great moments together. The album does not have a low point (although I must admit tracks 8 and 9 - All The Love and Houdini had to grow on me), and I can not pick a favourite because they all have been at one point. This album is an absolute masterpice and I can not thank the artist anough for somehow creating it.<br /><br />10 / 10
B00005JOFO|5.0|The Movie: <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain is about two men who work together one summer in extreme isolation. They form a deep bond during their time there and eventually sleep together. Because homosexuality is not accepted in their time and place (1960's Wyoming), they deal with conflicted emotions and go their seperate ways into marriages. While married, they reunite from time to time, taking trips to Brokeback Mountain where they continue an on-again, off-again affair lasting several years. <br /> <br />The two men feel differently about their relationship. Ennis (Heath Ledger) cannot bring himself to terms with it, and feels that it must always be hidden, in the shadows. His marriage suffers cruelly from it. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), however, wants to embrace their relationship more fully (ironically, perhaps, he has the better family life, though it is always hollow for him). Ultimately, their relationship ends tragically. Ennis' family dissolves and Jack is beaten to death on account of his homosexuality. <br /> <br />The film is quiet and powerful. The score and backdrops are sweeping and majestic. The acting is top-notch. The direction, excellent. The emotions, real. However one feels about the subject matter, this is a great film. <br /> <br />Its Reactions: <br /> <br />I have found the reactions to this film to be quite surprising. Friends, of whom I had never suspected any sort of bigotry, refused to go see it and only spoke of it with either irony or derision in their voices. And we can see in the reviews of this film here on Amazon (and the helpful/unhelpful votes) that it has provoked something intense and deeply-seated in many people. <br /> <br />It is my opinion that love is love (though, so the reader understands my personal context, I am both a straight man and politically conservative). I understand that some others feel that the portrayal of homosexual love is part of some \\"agenda\\"--they call it propaganda--but I don't think that, just becausea movie presents a different point of view than your own, it makes it somehow sinister or manipulative. I hope that everyone here who takes the time to rate these reviews or write their own has taken time to watch the film, prior to commmenting on it. I think that the film, itself, proves that it is not out to manipulate or \\"change society\\" except in the ways that art always does, by \\"holding the mirror up\\" and allowing us to examine ourselves. <br /> <br />Obviously, this was an important movie to make. The reactions prove it. While I had suspected that society was a little more sophisticated than to go crazy over a film like this, I was wrong. This is a dialogue we need to have. And so, to those who've seen the film and still wish to attack it, I actually want to thank you: while I disagree with what you believe, and the reasons you have for your attacks, its good that we have a chance to talk about it. <br /> <br />Five stars for the film itself and five stars for the important discussion it has launched.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is a wonderful disney movie . I love everything about it. I think the way this movie is will bring joy to all of us young & old . It's a film that brings a smile to your face & the music here is so nicely done on this movie. Way to go Wal Disney. Family film that will live on forever in our hearts. Everytime we watch it we will learn something new about the way films are made & the way that they all make us feel inside. I just love disney movies they rock!
B000E33VWW|5.0|Having read In Cold Blood a couple of years ago, I was very interested to watch Capote, a movie about the writing of that \\"non-fiction novel.\\" <br /> <br />This is an amazing movie, because we get to see what Truman Capote had to go through in order to bring his masterwork to life. We come to understand how Cold-Blooded Capote, himself, had to be in order to get the information he needed to finish the book. And how it killed him inside. <br /> <br />The actor, Hoffman, deserves all of the accolades he gets--the acting in this film is phenomenal. It is one of the best films of 2005 if not the best. Truly wonderful.
B000E8N690|5.0|First of all let me make a statement.  I am not a country music fan!  My wife rented this movie last night and invited me to watch it with her.  I gave in and fired up the plasma tv and bose system.    Then a funny thing happened....For the length of the movie I sat in amazement.  The acting was extremely good,  The story was interesting, and the dialog was well above average.  Pheonix has proven to be an exceptional actor.  Both Pheonix and Witherspoon gave a very convincing performance.  Before last night, I had never really paided any attention to Johnny Cash or cared one iota about his life and accomplishments.  I was surprised at what challenges life had dealt him before and during his climb to fame.  Few films have ever left me feeling enriched, but this one did!  When it was over I thought that it was terrible that Johnny and June had not lived to see this film.  I think they would have been honored by the performance and production of this movie.  I'm still not a C&W fan, but now I have a healthy amount of respect for the \\"Man in Black\\". <br />Excellent Film.
B000A59PMO|4.0|There's nothing supernatural in \\"Veronica Mars,\\" but it's the best recent entry in the \\"follow the adventures of a cool young chick,\\" genre.  <br />(\\"Tru Calling\\" was unfocused, usually a downer, and everybody wants to see Eliza Dushku as a real butt kicker who doesn't have to be nice!) <br />Kirsten Bell is Veronica and she's a 38-year-old Phillip Marlowe trapped in a cheerleader's body, the way her voice-overs sound some times. The rest of the cast is mostly great, and the episodes generally carry 2 plots per show; that week's special, and the on-going \\"Who murdered Lily Kane\\" season-long arc. The ending is surprising and sets up the next season brilliantly... although I'm waiting for someone to acknowledge that the reason that the universally-beloved Lily was murdered was because she was a slut who'd sleep with several members of the same family! <br />The series is so good, it truly sucks that there are no \\"true\\" extras other than deleted scenes. The Series is great, the discs are boring.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I've always enjoyed logan's run.  I was happy to be able to purchase online.  Very good transaction.  Delivered timely, new and sealed as advertised.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|James Blunt is definitely my new obsession. I adore his music and I truly love this album. Sometimes simple really is better. His lyrics aren't very elaborate but they are very poetic. James sings with such raw emotion, too, that he brings them alive. I've watched a few live performances of him and he conveys his emotion through his eyes. He's mesmerizing to watch. His voice is unique, his songs are excellent, and this is one of the most amazing albums I've ever heard. Buy it; you won't regret it!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This CD is a pleasure to listen to, and I'm not a COLDPLAY fan per se.  Easy to listen to, a unique sound...lyrics worth hearing.  You'll probably find several tracks to have on your ipod and definitely an album you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of...
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Miles Davis historians look at this album and at \\"Bitches Brew\\" which followed, and talk of how important these recordings were to Miles' career as a turning point.  This album is the first of Miles' \\"electric period,\\" a highly controversial segment of his career that produced some highly influential, profound music of arguable accessibility.  But what makes this album so incredible is not just how it was a beginning for Miles in fusion; it was the equivalent of the Second Continental Congress for the new genre that would dominate the jazz scene in the 1970s.  One only has to look at the personnel and think for a bit: in addition to Miles, the group consisted of Wayne Shorter on saxophone, John McLaughlin on guitar, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Joe Zawinul on keyboards, Dave Holland on bass, and Tony Williams on drums.  This is not just a list of the absolute top tier of young musicians of the time; it is literally the core group of EVERYTHING significant that happened in fusion.  Every one of these men with the exception of Dave Holland went on to start a fusion group: Shorter and Zawinul began Weather Report, Hancock started Mwandishi and later the Headhunters, Corea led Return to Forever, McLaughlin started the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Tony Williams led Lifetime.  Without exception, these groups were the defining forces of fusion (arguably the only ones that truly succeeded).  That's what makes this album so incredible in historical context; anyone who would leave a mark on fusion was here, and anyone who wasn't here...wouldn't.  That's what makes this more than an interesting experiment.  It was the planting of a seed that altered the course of the careers of each musician here. <br /> <br />As for the music itself, the description has been more or less covered by the myriad of reviews already here.  Suffice it to say that it is one of the rare musical documents that can be appreciated on ALL musical levels: there is enough interest in the soloists and group interaction to give it true depth and replay value, it's funky (though not overtly), it's brilliant mood music (as much as I hate that term), and it's even quiet enough to be shoved into the background (though why would you want to?).  My favorite moment is when Tony Williams finally ramps up the groove about 13 minutes into the second track and pushes Miles to the next level of intensity. <br /> <br />Get this album to hear the music which sent forth the new wave of true innovators, arguably jazz's last (at least for now).
B00097DX3U|4.0|The band really starts to jell with this CD. Much better than their first one.
B00030590I|5.0|I can't believe people are ripping this movie based on THEIR political beliefs.  Why do you care about the message that this movie tries to send to you.  Yeah, Jet could have blocked the arrows(maybe), or just flew over the wall, but he was making a point that this is the best decision he can make.  I am also one that believes that countries should be seperate just like states, but this movie went the other direction.  You are gonna rip one of the most beautiful movies ever because you didn't like the message that it sent, that is just wrong.  The way the story was told, the music, the visuals, the martial arts, the ACTING, I could go on and on about what makes this movie right, but the 2 biggest things for me were the visual ecperience at the mirror lake and the dramatic ending.  Overall one of the best movies ever.
0812548094|5.0|I thought that I was the type of person who would never start reading fantasy novels, but after finishing Wizard's First Rule, I became hooked. Stone of Tears was simply a breathtaking continuation in the series. I highly recommend that you buy this book and hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.
B000BO0LLS|3.0|I waited on this one with bated breath. Ever since the first record, and the masterpiece that is \\"Emotions\\", I had considered this little lady to be one of the greatest singers the rural South had ever produced. A true Golden Throat. The high, lonesome sound of her blue yodel reminded me of what Jimmy Rogers might have sounded like if he had an eight octave range and was SUPERFINE!<br /><br />The enhanced CD/DVD feature is impressive on this one too. A simple menu setup leads you through a tour scrapbook and on to some of Mimi's favorite vegan recipes. (I especially enjoyed the tofu haggis)<br />I also thought the extras were well thoughtout and full of surprises, as one of the \\"easter eggs\\" was an interactive game in which the viewer attempts to insert gold records into each of Tommy Matolla's orifices in under 30 seconds. (extremely challenging)<br /><br />Buy it now.
0451526384|5.0|I have read a couple of other Jane Austen novels, and I think this one stands with the best of them. Although we all know it will have a happy ending, Austen sustains the emotional suspense of *how* Anne and Wentworth will finally reunite, and I was not disappointed. Wentworth's letter brought tears to my eyes; it was so wrenchingly emotional and bare. Aside from the romantic plot line, this novel also draws a clear and humorous picture of the characters and social dynamics of the time, which I found fascinating. I recommend this book highly, especially to those who may be new to Austen, as it is shorter and less complicated that some of her more famous ones. The ending makes it all worthwhile!
630542828X|5.0|Is this movie a way of wrapping up a controversy or what? It is interesting but there is so much more here!!! Look at this and decide for yourself! <br /> <br />1) Whitey Bulger's brother has as an attorney the same man whose firm employed Jan Schlictmann, in this movie. Additionally, the names of principles being smeared in the case largely hail from the same county as Woburn: John Connelly,Robert Morris,Dennis Condon,Frank Salemme, H.Paul Rico,Sonny Mercurio,etc. Consider that the Bulger case fomented in sync with the appearance of this book! <br /> <br />2) Did the entrenched military-industrial complex feel that JFK was boosting space while dunking military budgets? As bases were being reviewed for closure, a small group of workmen appeared at the Portsmouth Naval yard from the Boston Navy Yard just before work was completed and the USS Thresher sank. Later testimony was said to have alleged 20% of the back-pressure relief valves were installed backwards, which could have caused the sub to explode/implode. Could JFK's pro-peace, pro-space economy shifting have caused a scramble to save a local base at any cost? Also,JFK was personally involved in authorizing Woburn as a future NASA site in the region of the polluted land. <br /> <br />3)How many WR Grace employees who did not pollute and may even have aggressively tried to prevent this were fired or lost substantial savings as the company tanked in the wake of this book? In the aftermath of this case,how would companies like Beatrice and Grace feel about conscientious employees? What protections do such individuals have from such entities as EPA or OSHA,if any? <br /> <br />4) Was one individual involved with a major company in this book told to help with a software development program and in fact was enrolled in a study with Omnitech International and shuffled between participating companies in the experiment and always traceable by government agencies represented in those companies? <br />
B00067BBQE|5.0|I don't really know what all the people were watching that gave this DVD a negative rating.....I loved every second of it !!! <br />The behind the scenes footage was especially entertaining as it gave me real insight into the band.

0783227434|5.0|Tiis is a great film for watching with a large group of friends, contains the kind of comedy and gore that is best enjoyed together!
B00000G3AZ|2.0|a quite boring movie with shallow heroine character, a snobbish, phony, self-important, self-righteous, self-centered female egoist. the novel is also as boring as the movie itself. like gossip? watch the daytime soap operas, hard copy, access to hollywood....
0446577383|3.0|Baldacci can certainly spin a nice yarn, and he does so here.  The plot is full of action, intrigue, and interesting twists.  And the book is certainly timely in light of all the controversy surrounding America's real lifes spy agencies.   <br /> <br />But to enjoy the book, you simply have to suspend disbelief over an incredible sequence of it's-a-small-world-after-all coincidences required by the plot.  And Baldacci also inserts a healthy dose of sermonizing against stereotyping the Islamic world into his characters' dialogue.  While I appreciate and agree with everything he and his characters say in this respect, the sermonettes make for some awkward passages and stilted dialogue.
0780619587|5.0|if this movie was based on a true story, then the father was the worst father ever existed on the earth. self-centered, self-righteous, self-important selfish monster, ruined his genius son with an excuse of his ultimate love. how could he call himself a music lover? a piano concerto extremist? this kinda father should be locked up for life. he was a tyrant at home, but a wimp once stepped outside his residence. a selfish, stubborn and disturbing soul who forced his own demon on his son and the whole family, with an excuse of 'who's your daddy? who loves you most?' my god, if the son got a normal father, he would have become even a greater, even the greatest pianist in the world. the movie itself is not important, but it's important for all the fathers in the world to take a serious look and then take a look of himself after watching this movie. don't you ever become one like this father, a demon hidden behind a big excuse of love.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I didn't enjoy this as much as some of the other Enya albums - but - there are some great songs on here and it's a CD that you can listen to over and over.

It's called \\"work\\".  Now, if he doesnt call you for several days, then take the advice of the authors. <br /> <br />Kind of hard on us guys.  I know that there are legit reasons that relationships don't work out, and (surprise) it isnt ALWAYS the guys fault. <br /> <br />The same advice goes for girls.
0767805712|5.0|I show this movie to my high school students when we are studying DNA.  They love it.
0399241515|5.0|I just can't get enough of Anthony Horowitz! This guy is just so creative! This story kept me reading all the time. I even read in the car (I wasn't driving). This action packed book was awesome. It is the best in the Alex Rider series. It even has a surprise ending. You just have to read this.
B00000IREA|3.0|Anyone who takes Jane Fonda seriously when she discusses politics has never seen this movie, I suggest you buy it. Every time I see her on TV opening her fat yapper about stuff she clearly doesn't understand, I just think about this movie, and what a dumb broad she really is. In this movie, her acting abilities were TERRIBLE! The only reason she got the part was because she agreed to get naked. She had a smokin body back then, but zero talent. This movie is lame from start to finish. But I think it is important for people to view this movie. Only a complete FOOL would take her politics seriously after seeing her performance in this flick. She's dumb as a box of hammers. Before you can understand her politics, you need to watch this film and ask yourself \\"what kinda moron would agree to a part in a movie like this?\\" The acting is terrible throughout the entire movie, the script is ridiculous, and the special effects just plain suck. The only reason I got this movie was to see her get naked, I could care less what she thinks about this & that. But after watching this movie, I don't see how any clear thinking person could listen to what she has to say about our troups. Besides, she looks old now, like a Harpy or something. She really hit the wall. Next time you see her on TV bashing our soldiers, just remember \\"Barbarella is at it again\\"!
0679777547|3.0|A reasonably well plotted and written mystery with overtones of the supernatural.  Perez-Reverte uses pursuit of a long obscured esoteric mystery related to devil worship as the central feature of the plot.  The  characterization is above average but the inclusion of a second parallel plot involving Dumas' Three Musketeers is a bit too clever.  An undemanding, long air travel type of book.
0790729628|2.0|It's a terrific movie! I've seen it a couple dozen times since its release in the early-eighties and this is one that I never grow tired of. The Director's Cut is exactly what the name implies \\"A Cut\\". Why the voice-overs were cut is beyond me. Decker's thoughts are what pulled the whole movie together. Without them, the movie is just not the same. Maybe the director decided to get Politically Correct - who knows.
B000E33VWW|2.0|This movie...uh, I don't know, it's...well it is.  I mean, I was on a plane and I desparately wanted to be engrossed in something, I was excited for this.  However, when it came on, I found myself far more interested in walking around the plane and annoying flight attendants. <br /> <br />I just don't see the merit here.  It did not draw me in, I did not care, and I really cannot see what the hype is about.  It just seems like this year at the movies was dominated by \\"hey remember that?\\" or \\"a triumph\\" because they were gay.  I miss when a good movie could be art without being politically groundbreaking or a snooty affair.  A big \\"what the heck?\\" goes out to Capote...enjoy whatever academy awards Brokeback doesn't get...
0671578855|4.0|The saga of Miles Vorkosigan continues, in the space opera tradition of the earlier books in this series. As we've come to expect, there's action, adventure, humor, and a bit of romance. This time, though, the balance is different. The action is mostly political infighting and backbiting, and romance takes center stage.<br /><br />Well, as romantic as Miles ever gets. That means reconnaisance, strategy, and a series of graduated attacks on the target of his affections, ineptly weilding gifts and notes instead of the usual weaponry. Miles being Miles, the results are about the same, including a predictable success in the end. Comic relief comes largely from the absent-minded professor and the fruits of his life-work: big ugly bugs, for which he has fatherly fondness.<br /><br />This installment doesn't fall into the \\"military SF\\" category as squarely as other books in the Vorkosigan series. Still, it's all you'd hope for; feel-good stories about grand lords and ladies, and everyone (good or bad) getting what they deserve in the end.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000E97X66|4.0|While the concert has its merits if you bought the 30th anniversary box set, this CD is redundant. I burned a CD of this concert from the DVD that was included in the box set the day the set went on sale. While I admire Springsteen as an artist, to put out a CD of the very same performance that is already available on DVD smacks of fan exploitation. Guess the boss needs a new pink Cadillac to go racing in the streets down Thunder Road. Sorry, but I'll keep playing my \\"bootleg\\" copy instead of shelling out more bucks for something that I've already got.
0061020680|4.0|Literally to Death, not that that's a bad thing. Mortimer, Mort as he's known professionally, becomes apprenticed to the Grim Reaper. The job has a lot going for it: travel, the chance to meet all kinds of people (if only briefly), and flexible hours. In fact, some of the hours are so flexible that they get tied in big ugly knots.<br /><br />The problem - in Pratchett's books, there's always a problem - comes when Mort's attempt at Grim Reaping collects the wrong soul. Someone who ought to have died didn't, and the conflict of free will vs. predestined determinism breaks into open warfare.<br /><br />Pratchett's Discworld series sets very high standards. So high that Pratchett himself doesn't always equal his best, but this is good anyway. It's funny, and leaves you laughing so hard that it might take a while to realize that there are some interesting points being made. It may also be a good one for Prathcett novices, since it doesn't extend as many onging plot threads as other books in the series. Both in itself and among other members of the series, it's an enjoyable read. Go for it!<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JKZ3|4.0|This was a worthy sequel, we still have all the characters we<br /><br />loved in MIB1 and more. Quality and special effects are great and<br /><br />the story does'nt slow down for character devellopment.<br /><br />Bring on MIB3...but only if Smith and Jones are in it.
B00003CXI1|3.0|It has been such a long time since a creative mind actually found the power to create a story that captured the imagination of the entire world at the perfect moment. Harry Potter the story of boy who finds out he is a big part of a hidden world of magic, spells, and mythical creatures, now must join it only to discover he is being hunted by the one who murdered his family.<br /><br />I was already a huge fan of the books, so when the movie was set to be released in 2001 I was very excited and curious to see how it would turn out. I enjoyed the movie, unlike many who said it was long and sometimes boring. Read the tagline people...'Let The Magic Begin'. Hello we still have 6 more parts to this story! 'Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone' is just like every first installment of a major film saga. Introduce the main characters show us their part and of course just throw a tiny bit of foreshadowing of what is yet to come.<br /><br />This movie is truly enjoyable for anyone who wants to get away from the real world. The characters are great as well as the actors who play them. I was also amazed at how Chris Columbus tried as best as he could to keep this first movie as close to the book as possible. Yes there were some things taken away and a few others changed for the sake of cinema, but for the first part of this grand story when the movie was over the only thought going through my head was... \\"It can only get better from here.\\"
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Sometimes what happens with a classic film that you watched when you were younger was that it held a bigger place in the past than it did when you rewatched it. Re-watching Cinderella and Pinocchio recently, I noticed that I loved it more when I was younger. Lady and the Tramp though still feels special and still holds up after many years. Adding the film to the big Platinum release, Disney has restored the original aspect ratio and cleaned it up, providing the best looking film available. <br /> <br />Jim Dear and Darling are a married couple who gets a puppy for Christmas, a cocker spaniel named Lady. Lady becomes nice and pampered and befriends some local dogs. However, Darling(who knows what her real name is) gets pregnant and Lady doesn't get as much attention. Spending her time outside now, Lady befriends Tramp, the dog from the wrong side of the tracks. They fall for each other, only he did something that makes her mad and him potentially getting himself in the pound. <br /> <br />The film became a landmark since it was the first animated feature done in widescreen. Growing up in the VHS era with its ugly quality and full screen ratio, it's quite shocking to see the film all cleaned up and wiiiiide. Unlike the earlier release Bambi where you could tell the characters were put on their backgrounds, this film is more improved and the blending is seamless, not to mention it's quite a colorful film.  <br /> <br />One complaint the film received is in regards to its sterotypes, namely the siamese cats. With that typical chinese accent, it's got that sound of people who didn't know what chinese sounded like but they just thought \\"bet they're like this!\\" Compare these voices to Mulan's. Then we get a scottish puppy, a german puppy even a quite stereotypical mexican chihuahua sounding much like Speedy Gonzales. <br /> <br />What makes the film work though is the love story. It's oh-so cute and you can't help but go aww during it but it's got issues too. Lady gets incredibly jealous of Tramp's previous girls. The girl's never heard of bad relationships? Another thing was there's an event late in the film that's quite heartbreaking so rather than having a touching and emotional ending, they copped out and \\"Disneyfied it\\"(reportedly because Walt didn't want a Bambi repeat). <br /> <br />It's the best release of the film and a highlight in Disney's catalogue, although minor quibble, which there was a commentary by somebody.
0930289234|5.0|There's not a lot to say about Watchmen which hasn't already been said. But, as is so rarely the case, the hype is true. Nothing could possibly be the same in comics after something like Watchmen. The heroes aren't really heroes, but far from being the cookie-cutter antihero, they have surprising depth and emotion. They all perceive the world in radically different ways, and it's apparent in the way Moore writes. For example, Dr. Manhattan, the blue superhuman with the power to manipulate atoms, is narrated like no superhero has ever been before. He exists in several places at once, experiences the future, past, and present simultaneously. He has the power of God. Yet, at the same time, he is so lost in the world, he ends up having to desert it for Mars. And there's not a single moment when the reader won't sympathize with him.<br /><br />The characters are some of my favorites outside of Transmetropolitan. Despite their silly names and costumes (even sillier than the average superhero, if you can believe it), they all have a startling three dimensionality to them.<br /><br />The story is interesting and unique, starting with the murder of one of the few remaining active heroes, The Comedian, (see what I said about the silly names? And wait until you read the comic, he wears a sort of quasi-bondage getup...) which is the obvious inspiration of one of today's most original concepts. ('Powers')<br /><br />From there, it just continues to become more and more convoluted and compelling.<br /><br />Read it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
0440211727|5.0|A Tme to Kill, the debut novel from Acclaimed writer John Grishman deals with the thinly threaded storylines dealing with a rape and attempted murder of a [young] black girl.  Soon after race issues boil over as protesters on both sides of the fences barrier over the woodwork. Grishman expertly narrarates this complex issue by focusing on the more simplistic, organic notions of the case, and the bodies that are affected by each decision that is made.  True, the ending seems rather rushed and he certainly could of filled another 50-100 pages without question, but in the long run everyone believes that this magnificent story of Racial disharmony in present day and age end up asking, not answering, questions that need to be asked. Grishman was quoted in the reprinted foreword in saying he wouldn't change a word.  With a story like that, you can see that he doesn't need to, compelling storytelling will always be compelling storytelling. In the End Grisham nails it out of the park, and leaves his readers yearning for more.
0930289528|4.0|I'll have to admit I was reluctant to give this product less than the full five stars. The concept is brilliant, the main character is unique and instantly likeable, the setting is well thought out, and the execution is clever, if a bit slow. The problem, for me, was the art. I have to admit it was rather unique, with a heavy influence from the more classic DC style. However it's painted in watercolor and the contrast and depth of the color is extremely poor. On top of that, it's printed on cheap pulp paper, which is just puzzling: It's just been turned into a huge movie license by the Wachowski brothers, and even says so on the cover. So why would they print their merchandise, so recently equated to printing money, on the lowest-quality paper available? <br />Who knows. Not only are the colors poor, the images tend to fade off. Every copy I've seen so far has had pieces of its art and text rubbed out due to the low-quality ink used. <br />This comic deserves to be called a classic, and as such deserves to be treated like one. This should be in hardcover with glossy paper and good ink, but it's not. <br />I suggest reading this comic, but I couldn't reccommend buying it, because in its current form, it just won't last.
B00008QSA5|5.0|\\"Super Session\\" still sounds fresh and exciting after 35 years. What makes the album great is the guitar playing -- Mike Bloomfield for the first half, and Steven Stills for the rest. Al Kooper's keyboards and vocals supply the continuity in sound. Bloomfield's playing is among his best recorded work. He sounds like a jazzy B.B. King with his precise, melodic solos. \\"Stop\\" and \\"His Holy Modal Majesty\\" are highlights, but all his songs are excellent. Stills' playing on this album has been underrated by critics. \\"Season of the Witch\\" displays some of his richest playing. Kooper and colleagues' arrangements are inventive and effective, with their rockin' version of \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh\\" a stand-out. The additional tracks on this version of the CD do not really add to quality of the original, but they do provide some insights into the process of producing the music. For example, after listening to \\"Season of the Witch\\" without horns, one is likely to conclude that Kooper did a great job in including them in the original album. Overall, this is an excellent album, revealing Bloomfield at a high point in his playing (sadly, drugs and other demons would trouble him until his premature death in 1981). Stills' fine guitar playing is also a revelation. And Kooper never had a finer hour on record.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|Though many of the tracks like Human After All are very catchy and fun however within a week they get very old.  Essentially, nearly every track on the album revolves around singing the same few words run through a vocoder over and over again throughout the entire song.  While there are some cool manipulations of sound and nifty techno guitars, the obviously formulaic approach to constructing each track lends the album to a short shelf life.  Also, the beginning of \\"The Brainwasher\\" seems lifted directly out of Black Sabbath's \\"Ironman\\" humorously.  A fun album, but not one that you'll get much replay value out of.

6305428352|5.0|\\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\" is, in my opinion, one of the greatest contemporary classics. This film shows how a teacher can have a tremendous impact on years' worth of students. Richard Dreyfuss is a struggling composer and musician who is \\"dragged into\\" teaching music at a high school. He's filled with hopes and dreams of his own, but the realities of life, large and small, affect him. Even though he has such a passion to strive for greatness of his own through composing and being a musician, his true passion comes out through his teaching. Again, truly how a teacher should be. Mr. Holland not only taught the values and essence in musical education, but the everyday, importnat values in life. He taught the values of determination and courage, like a shy and quiet girl trying her heart out to be great at playing the clarinet, or a distressed ex-football and ex-wrestler student how to play a bass drum. Simple little stuff; well, maybe not little, because as he syas \\"It takes a lot of work to learn a musical instrument.\\" However, a little confidence and determination can go a long way. The different characters of certain students depicted in the film are just examples of how effective this teacher was. A great example is the senior girl who dreams of going to New York to become a famous singer. Mr. Holland realizes that there was truly someone who was passionate about something he could relate with. If it hadn't been for his confidence he instilled, she never would have gone on and pursued her dream. (It would have been nice to have known if she made it or not. Then again, I don't know if it's a true story, but we got to have a little imagination.) It's sad to know that because of some rotten budget, he was cut from his job along with the entire music and arts programs in the school near the end of the story. Still, even though we start to feel that it was all for what, his is a success story, as the generations and years of students who respond to his retirement, particularly the clarinet girl as she became the governor! It seems like all that drive and confidence to get to something like that all lead back to Mr. Holland. To me, there should be so many more teachers like that. Yes, \\"life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,\\"; it's true. It was in the students that he inspired and lead to success.
0307276902|5.0|Very intense book, well worth the read. The journey Frey takes you on is fascinating, heartbreaking and heartwarming all at once. Whether it's fact or fiction, it's an excellent book.
0743265289|5.0|If you know you are a high scorer - look no further! <br /> <br />I am an engineer, and I had very limited time to study (2-3 weeks).  I worked only on verbal as I figured I had the math covered. <br /> <br />I almost cancelled the test because I thought I screwed up the verbal.  I finished with 5 minutes to spare, and I had only easy questions the whole way through the test, so I figured the CAT was not giving me hard questions because I had gotten so many wrong. <br /> <br />I wound up with a raw score of 47 on the verbal - where a 44 is the 99th percentile!  The questions in this book were so much harder than the actual test that I couldn't believe it! <br /> <br />My best piece of advice is to stay loose.  I was so focused on getting every question right on the math that I got hung up on several questions and ran out of time at the end.  I wound up getting 49 score/90 percentile on the math, which I thought was my strong suit!  If I had cut my losses and guessed on the hard question on the math, I would have done much better.  On the verbal, I 50/50 guessed on many answers since I wasn't so focused on getting everything right.  YOU DON'T NEED TO GET ALL THE ANSWERS RIGHT TO DO WELL! <br /> <br />My final score was a 760.  I'm sure I would've gotten 790-800 if I had not wasted time on hard questions on the math.
0553801503|2.0|Okay, what do we expect when an author has killed off, or tried to kill off, most of his major characters?  Then he gets a major case of writer's block for HOW many years???!!  Yes, a sub-par effort.  He's trying to dig himself out of the hole he created.  I really enjoyed the first 3 books - a fantastic effort.  I hoped that Martin wasn't turning into another Robert Jordan (won't waste my time anymore with anything he writes - hundreds of pages where absolutely nothing happens), but seems like I won't get my wish.
B000E8N690|3.0|Without any computer generated special effects in sight this is the rare big budget movie that succeeds due to the actors.The story about the rise of Johnny Cash and his one true love is nothing surprising or groundbreaking but it's the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon that make it special.The two have great chemistry together onstage and off and give enjoyable renditions of classic songs.Maybe not everything in this biopic is historically accurate but Johnny himself would've approved how they captured the intensity of his love for June.
6305291446|5.0|Out of the many sequels, this one rings a familiar bell. It is the one sequel that doesn't hold back and, in my expert opinion, recharges the legend of Mihael Myers. It's darkly omunious and even more scary to find out that Michael has come back to reek havoc on Laurie Strode, even when she's all grown up. What ensues is a perfect halloween story for the modern age. And what is good is that this movie ends on a sharp note. It is genuinely frightening at all the right corners. It's Halloween: Ressurection that sucks big time.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I loved this album...it was a great tour too...I love the unedited music video that comes on it...
B00005JN0T|5.0|Although this movie is heavy on the effects it is also heavy in mystery. No one is quite sure why a robot, which is three laws safe, just all of a sudden murders someone. And that's why the film's protaganist has to be a robot hater. It's a turmoil of mixing one's job with one's dislikes. But the robot creates a sympathetic demeanor which gives way to numerous questions. Can robots lie? Are they learning new tricks? More importantly, what are they after besides our acceptance. From the same man who brought you Dark City comes a sci-fi rush to the finish line that will leav you aching for more. Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is some of Joss' best work. I was not a fan at first, but after I saw the film Serenity I became curious about the series. Let me say that I was shocked at how quickly I saw all 13 episodes and then was left with a hunger for more. I really hope that the series is somehow revived or at least that there be a sequel or two of the movie. You gotta check this series out, you won't be disappointed.
0780622553|5.0|The perfect sc-fi thriller stats off with a look up at the stars. \\"At first, there were the strangers . . .\\" says the narrator of the begining. Slowly, but gently, we are taken into the world of John Murdock, a man who has woken up to find that he doesn't know who he is nor where he came from. Aside from that, he doesn't know why the whole city faints and sleeps at midnight. Plus, the sun doesn't seem to come up. Freaked out? So was he. This darkly telling of suspense and mystery has the perfect period piece; the 1950's. The entire plot concept is something described as explosively imaginative. But this movie, even though it broke even at the box office, is a rare gem of gems in the world of sci-fi. I've never seen a science fiction movie that incorporates Film Noir. It's pure genius. This movie deserves it's own genre. Call it dark revelation cinema. It's good. Enjoy!
B000E1KO06|4.0|This by far isn't my favorite Helloween album but it has it's moments. This 2006 Remastered/ Expanded Edition of Pink Bubbles Go Ape is still worth it even if you have the original especially if you don't have all the singles with the bonus tracks (which are only 4 tracks, there should have been more on this). Anyways this version definately sounds better than the original.

B000E8QVWY|4.0|I am a huge Johnny Cash fan and have been since I was a little kid. I must say that when I heard Joaquin Pheonix was going to play Johnny Cash I was skepticle. But then I saw a preview and thought, \\"You know except for being tall enough he has the mannerisms down and I think he can pull this off.\\" I hate Reese Witherspoon in most of her films so that kind of was bad for me too. But I decided to go see it and I was blown away. First both did their own singing and did a good job. I think it might have been top notch if they would have used John and Junes real voices but you can't complain on the out come of them doing their own. The story is also excellent and heartwarming. It has funny moments and also very sad moments. It also shows the downside of showbiz and drug addiction. But it also is inspriring in the story of June and John's love. Also Robert Patrick was excellent as Johnny's father Ray Cash and it really showed Patrick as a very good actor. The story of John and his fathers tension and then finally them declaring a truce and almost reconciling later in life was also heartwarming.<br /><br />This is a very good movie. Even if you are not a Johnny Cash or country music fan you should watch it. Its just good filmaking.
B00005J6UP|3.0|I bought this for my youngest son who is now into pirates.  He loved it.  I remember it from the 80's and enjoyed seeing it again.
0440180295|3.0|I was an English major in university, but I was never required to read Vonnegut and many other \\"classic\\" authors you hear the intellectuals talk about so much. I've decided to remedy that so I know what people are talking about.<br /><br />I had heard people speak of Vonnegut's great humor. I suppose he is a great humorist in the dark humor genre, sitting alongside Thurber in that respect. However, I felt his humor was bland and a little too blase. It wasn't to my tastes. Perhaps some of Vonnegut's other works are a bit better.<br /><br />As far as the themes of this book go, I don't see them as ground-breaking as others have. War is bad, yes. The Serenity Prayer is a good philosophy, but by no means unknown. Dresden was a horrible incident in time.<br /><br />Vonnegut's downplay of war came across less as humor to me as it came across as apathy. So it goes. While I didn't hate the book, I didn't love it either. Just another author to add to my list of reading accomplishments.
B0006399FS|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this band and their messages. It is just that there are only so many times they can cover the same topics {world disarray, hunger, love gone wrong...}  <br />I found Vertigo musically catchy and different until it was flogged to death by radio. <br />Still, at least Bono is trying to make a difference in the world and putting his time and money where his mouth is. A refreshing change whether one agrees with his methods or not, at least he's DOING something!
1416500294|4.0|The main character is Jim and the book is about how all the pirates on the ship are trying to get to treasure island. I think that the auther did a very good job with describing the characters and places in the book. I also think that the auther was not very descriptive when he was talking about things. At times the plot was very confusing. In the book the sentence structuse I think sometimes was very pourly done. I think that because the sentences went on and on but the pharagragh was vey fine sizes. <br />Sometimes the book is very hillarias. Over all the this book was pretty good. I would not recommend this book to younger aged kids because the book uses a couple curse words and some of the words are kind of challenging. When you read the story it keeps you interested, yet it is a good sized book. I think that this book is really interesting because it will keep you thinking the entire time and it relates to other sea books.       <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002AHC|3.0|'Notorious Byrd Brothers' was released in 1968 as the fifth studio album from The Byrds.  It was the first Byrd album that did not produce at least one Top 40 hit.  The band had scored a run of seven Top 40 singles since 1965, including two number one hits.  Released in 1997, this remastered CD does much to reveal the reasons behind this weak production, and while the bonus tracks are a welcome supplement to the brevity of the album, there isn't enough of value there to save it.  While anything produced by the collective efforts of Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman is bound to be revealing of their individual talents, the discord within the band seems to have altered their artistry and even their judgement.  A key point of controversy within the group, for instance, was whether Crosby's risque composition 'Triad' should find inclusion on the disc.  One listen to The Byrds rendition, and comparing it to songs that made the original vinyl (such as 'Space Odessey' and 'Tribal Gathering'), reveals what a no-brainer this was.  Perhaps The Byrds no longer wanted to be counted along with Crosby's peculiarities, but such artistic discord could only lead to Crosby bolting from the band, which he did before the final version of the disc was assembled. <br /> <br />It's rather remarkable that the individual songs themselves reveal a sort of internal discord within the psyche's of the individual members.  'Natural Harmony' for example, a Chris Hillman track, begins with a dreamy, surreal, even jazzy introduction, but then turns boldly psychedelic.  'Draft Morning' follows with lyrics addressing the horrors of war, but with a mellow melody and a psychedelic/Sgt. Pepper's sounding use of horns.  There is also great contrast in this song's verses and chorus, and a nice bass line from Hillman picking up a bit of slack in the production.  'Wasn't Born To Follow' follows with catchy vocals and guitar hooks, but with more psychedelic meanderings.  'Get To You' begins witha beautiful medody underlying the initial verses, then serves up a disjointed chorus.  'Change Is Now' begins as an undistinguished ballad, lulling one into drowsiness, then launches into a psychedelic guitar-fest.  'Old John Robertson' starts out as a folk ballad well-suited to one of The Byrds first two albums, but sports an unusual, classical bridge.  More juxtaposition awaits on track nine, 'Tribal Gathering', moving from lounge-style ballad to an engaging discharge of heavy metal music.  'Dolphin's Smile', another Crosby track, is another whistful ballad interupted by psychedelic eruptions.  Add to these tracks the horn-laden discourse on amphetamine abuse, 'Artificial Energy', and the first bonus track, Roger McGuinns 'Moog Raga', a mind-meld of sitars and synthesizers, and you have one of the most unusual collections of songs to be found anywhere in the annals of rock.  Then there's the instrumentals, 'Bound To Fall' (an interesting, and entertaining track, which eventually wound up in the able hands of Stephen Stills and Manassas), and a demo of 'Change Is Now', titled 'Universal Mind Decoder'.  Just to completely confuse the situation, all of the barely managed chaos is completely tamed by the presence of not one, but two versions of Carol King and Geoffrey Goffin's nostalgic 'Goin' Back', perhaps the one song on the record deserving of a spot in the Top 40. <br /> <br />While this album offers a number of quality tracks, it feels like a puzzle with male and female dovetails that don't quite fit with one another.  It seems everyone is going in a different direction, and while most of the band may be content to work with one another, they don't seem to be working together.  The depth of the discord is vividly revealed in a hidden track at the end of the disc, a studio altercation between Crosby and drummer Michael Clarke, who can't seem to get the beat Crosby is looking for, and who can't seem to care less.  There are more 'F-words' used than in Freddy theFreeloaders family.  Despite the many drawbacks, the disc does come handsomely packaged, as are all of The Byrds remasters.  I suppose this is rock and roll history, which isn't always a pretty picture.
B000B8IA2G|1.0|Stargate: Atlantis is amazing. Buy it. But not here, or anywhere else in Canada. Due to a mix up, Stargate: Atlantis was incomplete, as the contents on disk one are also on disk five. The problem is non-existent on the US release, so order this from an American source.
078324228X|3.0|I actually give this movie two separate ratings. First, solely as a cinematic and artistic story I give the movie a 4, maybe even a 4.5 but as some of the other reviews have pointed out, there are some very large historical inaccuracies. Here is my review on each: <br /> <br />Movie: <br />As a movie \\"The Hurricane\\" is excellent. Denzel Washington does a great job as do the other actors in this film. It is definitely a tear jerker and helps portray racism which WAS very prevalent during the civil rights movement era. The movie is entertaining and enjoyable, the problem lies with the claim that it is a \\"true story.\\" The best part of the movie is that it exposes horrible corruption,but when that corruption is possibly false, the movie loses credibility. If it had a different title and was described simply as a story, none of these issues would exist. <br /> <br />The Facts: <br />I am not a lawyer, or a judge, or anything that has to do with crime. I am an officer in the US Army and hopefully someday a business executive. Therefore, I can not give any \\"facts\\" regarding the case. Having said that, there is much controversy over what actually happened. It is definitely true that the image of Rubin Carter in real life differs from what is depicted in the movie as well as the image of his friend, John Artis. What the movie doesn't say is that Carter WAS in fact a criminal before he ever was accused of committing the triple murder, one of his crimes being the brutal beating of three people. Additionally, Carter was court marshaled 4 times and was kicked out of the Army after serving only approx 21 months.  After released from prison, friend John Artis was arrested again and convicted for dealing drugs (cocaine.)  <br />Artis and Carter were never declared innocent of the murders, they were released from prison due to an error in the judicial process. I do not know whether Carter and Artis are guilty or innocent and I encourage anyone who becomes interested to do theirown research. Be careful what site you get your info from...\\"graphic witness\\" for example has been accused of being racist. Check the article about Carter on Wikipedia, it seems more reliable and is from a more trust worthy source.  <br />Lastly, we need to remember that there in fact was much racism in this country at the time and to some degree there still is. Often people don't like to admit it. The truth is that racism may or may not have played a part in Carter's trial and he may be innocent, but he may also be guilty. Either way the movie definitely has some factual errors but hey, it's Hollywood, I mean, the true story of U571 is that the British stole the Enigma machine, unlike the film, the American's were no where to be found. <br />Take Hollywood with a grain of salt and enjoy the movie as it is a great piece of entertainment and features some excellent actors giving heart touching performances. <br />
B00005PJ8O|5.0|This is a movie that I watch every time it comes up on the movie channels. It is enthralling, captivating, uplifting and a lesson for us all. George C. Scott was larger than life when he lived among us and so was George S. Patton. The casting for this movie could not have been better. It tells the story of this \\"magnficent bastard\\" (as he refers to Gen. Rommel) as well as it ever could be told.    In watching the movie, Scott truly becomes Patton. You can feel the metamophosis.    There is nothing pretty about war, however this movie can make it uplifting while peering into the bowels of the beast. Those who fight the war are mere mortals, even though they may not believe that at the time.     For wars to be won...the generals sometimes have to be a bit mad. Count Patton among those, but do not dismiss his brilliance which Scott captures.    You can do as I have done and just wait for cable to run this picture which it does a lot. Or you can remove the wait and buy the DVD. To have George C. Scott on the end of my leash is both comforting and empowering.    Go for it. It's one of the best!!
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend (born John Stephens) puts out a great debut CD with this one entitled \\"Get Lifted.\\" His voice is in fine form and the musical arrangements couldn't be better. Everything is very neatly planned. At times Legend reminisces about his childhood in the song \\"It Don't Have To Change\\" featuring the Stephens family. Snoop Dogg himself also contributes so damn well to this album in the song \\"I Can Change.\\" Look for Kanye West to help out with the songs, too!<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent; and the liner notes include (almost) the full lyrics and credits for each song. There are great pictures of John both today and from his childhood; and the credits are very nicely done.<br /><br />One note: this is a review for the CD version that has explicit lyrics. In case this is an issue for you, then this CD is not for you. There's another CD by John Legend for sale on the Amazon web site that does not say \\"explicit lyrics\\" but I cannot guarantee that the lyrics on that CD have been edited.<br /><br />I think my favorite song on this album would be a tie between \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"It Don't Have To Change.\\" John plays the piano so well in the first song and when his own family members come in with \\"It Don't Have To Change,\\" I was very touched and moved. I could really identify with John's desire to go back to simpler times.<br /><br />John obviously has great talent and can move rather skillfully between slow jams, some elements of hip-hop and contemporary R&B and soul in general. This is just the beginning for John and already I want his sophomore album! Where do I go to buy it?  :-)
B00006F83Y|2.0|I was hoping this C.D. would be better then it is.  Track #2 is the best song on the C.D. I LOVE the vocals and the bass work.  If the other songs on this C.D. were even remotely close to track #2 I would have been in heaven.  As it is I'm still waiting in purgatory.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I see many people picking it apart because it's historically inaccurate.  That didn't bother me so much  as the fact that it \\"felt\\" like watching 2 movies, both of which were horrible.  A 30 minute clip of CGI graphics of the most weasel-like thing this country has ever had done to it, and then 2+ hours of the lamest romance movie ever.  I felt like I had been tricked into watching a chick flick, with a few explosions in the middle of it.  This movie should go to the \\"Land of Misfit Toys\\" or something similar, never to be seen again.

B000002H6C|5.0|I own every Metallica CD. HUGE fan, favorite band. This is their best work. I play the drums and FINALLY you can hear Lars' use of the double bass. In the previous 3 it was a hidden sound, but it's much crisper in this CD. The whole CD is amazing: <br /> <br />1. Blackened - Best opening song of any CD. The fade-in intro and beginning guitar riff is SWEET.   (12/10) <br /> <br />2. And Justice for All - A heavy song which is long, but makes its length makes is so good. James' vocals are very good, he accentuates some lyrics more than others which makes the song sound BA. (12/10) <br /> <br />3. Eye of the Beholder - Beginning drum and guitar solos are very unique in this song. I especially love the guitar solo in the middle of this song. (12/10) <br /> <br />4. One - Metal at its finest. A song with a slow rhythm that bleeds into fast, aggressive medal. Fantastic, it's a classic.  (12/10) <br /> <br />5. The Shortest Straw - One of my favorites on the CD. Heavy, excellent drumming, cool solo. I love the lyrics: \\"The Shortest Straw has been pulled for you.....\\"    (13/10) <br /> <br />6. Harvester of Sorrow - Another one of my favorites. Slower beat and rhythm than the others on the CD, which I think makes it great. Another great intro w/ the guitar and drums. A Metallica classic.    (13/10) <br /> <br />7. The Frayed Ends of Sanity - Love the intro, great song, awesome solo. Very catchy.    (11/10) <br /> <br />8. To Live is to Die - Great way to remember Cliff. Sad what happened to him, and at times the guitars sound like they're fit to play at a funeral. The short \\"poem\\" towards the end of the song is eerie in a way, but fitting. 2nd best instrumental (Orion is my favorite).    (12/10) <br /> <br />9. Dyer's Eve - My favorite song on the CD. FAAASSSSTTT. AWESOME 2x bass. Fast guitar, and lyrics. Love it, listen to it before I play my baseball games.     (15/10) <br /> <br />Metallica's best CD. I love all of their music, but I find myself listening to this one themost.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0002DB52M|5.0|While watching the beginning of this movie, I didn't think I would be as into it as I became. <br /> <br /> <br />It seems the viewer has to get used to the idea of the set and the slow pace that the movie starts off with.  But if you are willing to give it a chance, the movie will haunt you. <br /> <br /> <br />In the movie, the townspeople act more and more callus to Nicole Kidman's character until they do the unimaginable to her.  I don't think that most directors would be able to display the subtleties and nuances involved that got the town to that point.  But this director is a master who shows the progression and introduces the steps leading up to the end in such a natural way that the viewer believes it. <br /> <br /> <br />This movie will horrify you, shock you and anger you.  But most of all, this movie will make you think. <br /> <br /> <br />If you can handle complexity and depth, you will be astounded by this movie. <br /> <br /> <br />Kudos to Nicole Kidman and the rest of the cast and crew.  You put together a brilliant film. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There isn't a better blend of comedy/drama/scifi than Firefly.  While the browncoats out there have stirred up a lot of excitement for this series, I was amazed at how well the series actually surpassed their promises.  Fantastic show.  Please bring it back.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|With all of the accolades piled on by Alt Press (et al) and the CD wrapper's sticker praising the disc with \\"some of the best melodies\\" one can find, at $8 this was seemingly a steal. This CD falls somewhere between foo fighter-eqsue meets broadway, or erasure with a guitar section. Definitely catchy, albeit weird at times, the CD unfolds like a theatrical production i haven't heard except on, well, musical soundtracks. After several listens through, I began to latch on. The intro song is a waste of 36 seconds but the 2nd tune (The Only Difference...) is definitely one of the disc's catchiest in a rock n'roll-way. The synth vocals on #4 (Tacks for Breakfast..) and the keyboard riff got embedded in my head for days. The lead-in on #5 (Camisado) and lick are hard to drop, but the lyrics (\\"bop bop ba dohdoh\\", \\"youve earned your presence at the ICU hall of fame\\") add a thick layer of cheese. A catchy #6 draws on the band's androgeny (\\"boys will be boys baby...\\") and has a classic vegas-esque shout-out (\\"when i say shotgun you say wedding\\"). #7 (Lying is the Most Fun...) comes off like a cabaret soap opera complete with octave spanning vocal lines (\\"haaaaaarlequin girls....\\"). The story line on #10 (I Write Sins...) is clever and the chorus rocks along with the whiney lyrics and xylophone background. The \\"almost-talking\\" singing of 12 and 13 arent the strongest on the CD, but somehow seem in context for the rest of the music. Bottom line, this is an interesting debut from these guys (their website is also clever) which sort of defies any label. Is it pop? Is it punk? It's definitely worth a listen.
B000002LGQ|5.0|To many critics this album was the album we all knew Madonna had in her, finally she had created a deep, emotional album that expressed her real maturity. Although initially a controversy, \\"Like A Prayer\\" was finally accepted as a classic and to many is her best album. \\"Like A Prayer\\" shows great diversity in styles and themes, the songs are each different and most important of all, amazingly well-written. This album really affirmed my faith in Madonna, even during the 80's she made good music, contrary to critical belief.<br /><br />Earlier on I stated that there was some initial controversy over this album, mainly the lead single \\"Like A Prayer\\". The video featured Madonna dancing on hill of burning crosses and a black Jesus, personally I see nothing wrong with a black Jesus, aren't Christians all for racial equality and acceptance, but I can see why the burning crosses were offensive, the producer/director of that video didn't need to use visual blasphemy to sell a video.<br /><br />Now onto the album, the opening title track is an amazing song that deals with love and religion heavily. It is a far different version to the remix on \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" and in my mind is far better, the guitars sound really authentic and fresh for the late 80's. \\"Express Yourself\\" brings some fun to the album with it's signature 80's beat and that hit factor. It talks about a man expressing himself and a woman putting their love to the test.<br /><br />\\"Love Song\\" is best described as an art-funk/old-school track and is basically a collaboration with Prince. Madonna would use some lyrics from this track in about 16 years for her monster club-hit \\"Hung Up\\". It seems a bit off-beat for me but lovely nonetheless. \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" is probably the best track on the album tied with \\"Oh Father\\". It has a very nice beat and chorus. Madonna's voice is superb, this song is about her marriage to Sean Penn.<br /><br />\\"Promise To Try\\" is a lovely ballad written about dealing with her mother's death. It's a sombre ballad but has a lovely piano and string instrumentation. Overall, a beautiful track. \\"Cherish\\" brings the listener back to happiness and the 'pop' Madonna. This song was a big hit when it was released and has a superb black and white video. It makes reference to Romeo and Juliet and is about cherishing your lover.<br /><br />\\"Dear Jessie\\" seems a little out of place on the album with it's child-like feel, it sounds like a nursery rhyme set to music. It's a very lovely track and should've been included on her greatest hits to show her diversity as an artist.<br /><br />\\"Oh Father\\" is a phenomenally good track with an overall sad tinge, it sounds like an ode to a dead father, I don't really know though. The song is amazing, the vocals show her range and the song is really well produced.<br /><br />\\"Keep It Together\\" brings back the funk while still having a serious message. The song sounds so modern, strangely not dated. It's basically an ode to her family situation. \\"Spanish Eyes\\" is this album's \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and shows off her fondness towards the Hispanic culture. Her vocals are really strong.<br /><br />\\"Act Of Contrition\\" is a short experimental track to end. It's a great neo-instrumental. I don't get it's purpose though.<br /><br />Overall, this album stands as one of Madonna's best, while the critic's favourite it still doesn't surpass \\"Ray Of Light\\". The songs are brilliant, without sounding dated and show her maturity and willingness to experiment with her music. This album is a must for any Madonna or 80's music fan, without it the 80's wouldn't have been the same and Madonna deserves huge credit and shouldn't be shunned.ling with her mother's death.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble has apparently been around a little while. Until recently I have never heard of him though.I listened to an album(Michael Buble) that a co-worker had and found his voice great.There are too few real vocalists out there today. It does seem that on Its Time that he modernized the sound. He has choosen what I think are two of the greatest love songs ever written.Leon Russell's \\"A Song for You\\" and \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\".Michael does a wonderful job with both of these songs. Although my favorite of all the songs on this album is \\"Home\\".Overall a great album for most anybody.
B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd's Animals is a classic. Although it didn't sell as well as Dark Side or Wish You Were here, it did hit #3 on the album charts and sold a modest 4 million in the States. The reason why Animals sank out of the charts quick was radio was too scared to play 10 minute pieces which were all great like Dogs, Sheep and Pigs. Also, Pink Floyd proved they can sell records without looking like $0.01 tramps like Madonna the guinea whop! Buy now or you will be toad soup!
0060229357|5.0|I have a vague/pleasant memory of this cartoon as a child and I was surprised to see it available (I enjoyed the HBO series in the 80's).  This character \\"Harold\\" is great for developing the imagination.  The book is brand new condition and I'm glad I found it on Amazon.
0767805712|3.0|Director:  Andrew Niccol <br />Cast:  Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Jude Law, Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, Jayne Brook, Elias Koteas. <br />Running Time:  106 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for brief violent images, language, and some sexuality. <br /> <br />\\"Gattaca\\" is intended as a cautionary tale about genetic engineering. The film takes place in a future world, not too far removed, where destiny is determined by genes: all babies (except for a few \\"accidents,\\" known as \\"invalids\\") are genetically engineered to near-perfection, people are hired on the basis of their genetic profile, and the imperfect products of accidental births are relegated to low-status menial jobs. Our hero, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), is an \\"invalid\\" who wants to rise above his genetic destiny. So, in an elaborate scheme, he buys the identity of Eugene Morrow, a genetically perfect athlete crippled in an accident, and gets the job he always dreamed about in a space-exploration program.  When the director of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation is murdered; however, investigations into the crime put into question Vincent's true identity, and he soon finds that his long deception could be unraveled and his life-long dream could be shot down in flames. With only fellow colleague Irene (Uma Thurman) and Jerome on his side, Vincent must race against the powers that are trying to put him back into the social hole he was supposedly born into and put an end to the life he has worked so hard to build. <br /> <br />The film has a very sorrowful approach to what sounds initially like a very lame plot. It's cinematic and stylistic without being pretentious or overdone, and the way it is shot and put together reflects very well the film's bland and sterilized society in pursuit of perfection. The chilling sense of realism that goes with the world of Gattaca makes everything within it become more than just a strange concept in a science fiction film. Not unlike Spielberg's 'A.I.', Gattaca very cleverly draws from horrors within our society today to suggest the terrifying prospect that our science will eventually render us, as a natural species, obsolete.  Director Andrew Niccol (\\"Lord of War\\") has done a fine job in transforming this sci-fi flick into something much deeper and more interesting. The writing is not spectacular, but is still better than most. Hawke's narration provides very good atmosphere for the film as he talks about the way of the world in this eerie future and the film's theme is very secure, with events such as the murder being practically irrelevant. The thing that matters most is Vincent's dream and the social inequalities that prevent him from actualizing it, and this is made very clear from beginning to end.  The acting performances are all very adequate, but the stand-out ones are Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, who seem so comfortable in their characters and, truth be told, share more chemistry than Hawke and Thurman do. This was one of Jude Law's first feature films, and it is a remarkably impressive debut.  Basically, this is a film that says what it means. Even in a world that has successfully bred perfection, people still suffer, the system is still unjust and lives still go to waste. Far from just being an unrealistic portrayal of what the future will hold, 'Gattaca' questions the ideals of mankind, the principles of civilization and leaves us to wonder what we, as a society are truly striving for.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I must agree with the majority and disagree with the minoirty: this video record of this special occasion is a pure delight from stem to stern.  I think anyone who does not hear fire is looking too much and not listening enough.  The bass lines are played with feeling and with pure musicality, the interaction between these three old bandmates has actually IMPROVED with time.   <br /> <br />Jack's voice has a lived in quality (as has Eric's) that is also on the records of older bluesman like Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker--i.e. those who managed to survive and still make music. <br /> <br />If you are looking for the kind of loud fireworks of earlier days...well those are there too, but in a different way.  The music and the musicians have aged, but as others have pointed out, like fine wine.  This is real music from the heart, head and fingers from three excellent musicians who clearly respect and love each other and the music. <br /> <br />This is NOT a mere excercise in nostalgia, so if you are looking for only that, well you will get a bit of that too, but that does not feel to me what this is about.  It is more about a classic musical trio playing some classic and timeless music.   <br /> <br />The video and sound quality is superb as is the song selection (I like Jack Bruce would have loved if \\"I Feel Free\\" would have been on here, but like him, I cannot see how they could have done that, as it was almost a pure studio creation). <br /> <br />For those people who get the blues, jazz, and the essence of what Cream did and still does, this is a must.
B00006AW2G|2.0|This remastered version is pretty well done as the sound quality is quite decent when played on your normal system (I don't have an SACD player and so I can't tell you how it sounds on that system),however, granted that there are a couple of great tracks on this album, the album in itself as a complete package isn't that great and doesn't come close to their other albums like \\"Exile On Main Street\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\" or even \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" in terms of overall quality of the tracks but I guess for something released in '69, this would have stood out at the time.<br /><br />\\"Gimme Shelter\\" is a great track which opens the album and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" is another great track which closes the album while the others are a little better than filler material or covers in between.  \\"Country Honk\\" is an amusing cover of their own material while \\"Love In Vain\\" is a poor attempt at covering the clearly superior Robert Johnson classic.<br /><br />Overall, the album sounded like they were recording while stoned.  Released the same year as \\"Abbey Road\\" by the Beatles although not even in the same league quality-wise.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is simply breathtaking! It combines many different elements and somehow makes everything fit together just perfectly, while also teaching an important lesson. It's a very fast-paced story with beautiful graphics and an incredibly deep storyline that only Hayao Miyazaki could have written. Also, look at some of Miyazaki's other works: Spirited away, Castle in the Sky, Kiki's delivery service, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and The Cat Returns. Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen! Please watch this movie, you will NOT regret it!
B000001ESP|5.0|People probably think of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream when they think about power trios but Rush has outlasted them both and are still playing some wonderfully complex material that still wins them fans among both the musicians and the casual listener.<br /><br />Speaking as both a guitarist and a great fan of music, I've been thoroughly entertained by Rush for many years and after all this time, \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Signals\\" are still my two favourite albums with the former only just pipping the latter for the title of Rush's best ever album.<br /><br />Neal Peart is quite possibly the world's best drummer and some of the stuff he plays on this album is simply amazing and is close to what you'd call jazz drumming and he plays solely on feel.  Geddy Lee's understated but competent bass work and his distinctive voice is excellent but I suppose as a guitarist, I'm most impressed with Alex Lifeson's work.<br /><br />If you want to hear what great, tight bands sound like, \\"Limelight\\" is a study in what great musicianship and mastery of your instrument sounds like and \\"Tom Sawyer\\" with that incredible intro is destined to become a rock classic.  Not a weak track on this masterpiece and like all classic albums, has to be heard completely at one sitting to truly appreciate its genius.<br /><br />This remastered version is very well done and so the sound quality is a definite improvement over the original.  Very highly recommended to both aspiring musicians and fans who want to hear what truly great music sounds like.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />The latest SHM-CD mini lp replica sleeve release (mlps) is no appreciable improvement sound quality-wise over my previously reviewed remastered version above but if you are a collector of mlps designs, this particular one comes with a 20-page booklet which contains the track listings and all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a very entertaining write-up by drummer Neil Peart called \\"Moving Pictures: A Rush Newsreel Bylines\\"  as well as a very faithfully replicated inner sleeve jacket and while the cover itself isn't exactly among the best mlps designs that I've ever seen it is still quite good and certainly not the worst.  At least the cardboard used is thicker and of higher quality although the overall assembly still isn't as good as say the recent ones that Sony did for the Michael Jackson and even the REO Speedwagon \\"Hi Infidelity\\" and Men At Work \\"Cargo\\" mlps releases which is what quality mlps designs should look like.  Strangely, \\"Cargo\\"'s mlps design was much, much better than \\"Business As Usual\\"  which shows that if the recording companies really wanted to they could come up with good quality mlps designs for all albums but I guess they do pick and choose which releases to give the first class treatment to and which ones not to although they have the audacity to charge us the same price for both!  The Michael Jackson mlps designs are very, very good though and are a fitting tribute to the late, great King of Pop.<br /><br />Overall, given the price tag you will have to decide if you want to \\"upgrade\\" to the mlps version although if you don't already have a copy of this great album, it may be worth getting this higher priced mlps version but not so much for the sound quality which hasn't been improved upon noticeably from the jewel cased prior remastered version.faithfully replicated inner sleeve jacket and while the cover itself isn't exactly among the best mlps designs that I've ever seen it is still quite good and certainly not the worst.

B0000009OX|5.0|music fan said it perfectly: \\"This is the perfect pop record.\\" Discard notions of BARRY MANILOW being pop.  This is pop.  Power pop, a cousin to punk that was raging at the time.  Not hardcore.  VIBRATORS, CLASH, 999.  Those guys were in the general class of this band.  But there was the Irish thing, not that I'm an expert.  And what's particularly amazing about the UNDERTONES is their pure focus on typical teenage pop subjects that you might expect from the BAY CITY ROLLERS.  Because they lived during 'the troubles' with Northern Ireland being occupied by English military and bombings and rotteness like that.  I guess STIFF LITTLE FINGERS lived in the same region and one was Prostant and the other band Catholic and SLF were political in their lyrics.  The UNDERTONES' music was far more tough than the very silly BAY CITY ROLLERS without being harsh.<br /><br />What makes this stuff shine is dual guitars, strong guitar presence and strong song writing.  The odd vocals, well, ya get used to it.<br /><br />The UNDERTONES went through a musical change to something softer and, I guess, in an effort to get more played on the radio and to be more actual pop stars.<br /><br />RED ROCKERS sorta did the same thing, not that many people know of them except maybe if they remember that one off radio hit they had in the early 80's 'China girl' or something.  They were from Lousiana.  The similarity to the UNDERTONES is both bands made incredible first albums then shifted in later albums to, it seems to me, to try to be more radio friendly and to make themselves a career in music.<br /><br />Basically, most punk bands don't make a career in music.  Several punk bands did get signed to major labels in England and I assume several did make a living at it.  Who?  The DAMNED?, the CLASH if they'd not sacrificed themselves financially, I dunno who else, ENGLISH BEAT?, the SPECIALS?, STIFF LITTLE FINGERS?, SHAM 69?.  I don't know.<br /><br />What I do know is that this UNDERTONES album and the 7\\" records that came in the same year or so with it along with their basically equally incredible second album, Hypnotized capture a sound that is never found in any other band: real strong pop carried by a strong guitar sound, tight musicianship and catchy song writing with a vocal that eventually captures your ears and ends up, for the next 25 years, sounding great.<br /><br />If you can use the 'listen' buttons so.  For any song.  I've loved this band since I first heard them and continue today, maybe just a notch slightly less cuz I'm not into hearing the same songs, same versions, over and over.  But I give it some years alone and go back to the stuff and it blasts all over again.  Particularly this album and the very tasty 7\\"s worth of music they've added to this CD.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|At the beginning of my review I'd like to state that I am a die-hard Jane Austen fan. P&P is my favourite JA book. Naturally, I've seen all possible film versions and although the 2005 version is not the best, it's not the worst either.<br /><br />Almost everybody considers the '95 BBC version as the best, as the most authentic, so I would like to defend this version in comparison with the latter.<br /><br />Nobody in their right mind should expect a movie to cover everything in a book, I mean, 2 hours is not 6 hours, right? I am not saying that the script could not have been better, because that would be carrying things a bit too far. Maybe they should've given more opportunity to Emma Thompson who turned the novel S&S into an amazingly good script.<br /><br />The scenery was very dramatic and beautiful, it could really express how the characters felt and what they were like. I liked the director's down-to-earth approach to the people, costumes and surroundings - ok, maybe the pig wandering through the house was not an indispensable accessory - versus the bit sterile and almost-too-groomed average appearance in the '95 series. Although I must say that the dark brown (YUK!) dress they made Keira wear while visiting Pemberley made me cringe in my seat.<br /><br />Concerning the \\"most important\\" character ... Mr Darcy, nobody can beat Colin Firth, that's for sure. However, I found Mathew MacFadyen's awkward and shy Darcy-figure humane and endearing. And I was positively surprised by Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth. She was convincingly lively, vivid and fresh. The chemistry between them was obvious (one of the most mouth-wateringly delicious scenes was the first proposal in the rain!) which is a welcome difference compared to BBC's P&P where Jennifer Ehle sadly failed - not intellectually, but sensually - to respond to Firth's wonderful, sexy presence. I always felt it was a terrible waste. So a stronger attraction on both sides was a welcome change.<br /><br />I liked Rosamund Pike's Jane, Tom Hollander's Mr Collins (David Bamber's performance was not simply bordering grotesque, it was grotesque!) and Brenda Blethyn's Mrs Bennet. Judi Dench as Lady Catherine was too aggressive for me and the younger girls too wild.<br /><br />The most disturbing thing was really the lack of time. When I first saw the film - used as I was to the detailing in the series - I was disturbed by how the events seemed to race by, but on the second show it did not bother me any more.<br /><br />All in all, I think the latest P&P fresh, delicious and enjoyable despite its shortcomings and worth watching twice.nge.  <br />I liked Rosamund Pike's Jane, Tom Hollander's Mr Collins (David Bamber's performance was not simply bordering grotesque, it was grotesque!) and Brenda Blethyn's Mrs Bennet.

B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is one of my favourite rock albums and I rate it as one of the best after WISH YOU WERE HERE,MEDDLE,THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and THE WALL.HUGELY RECOMMENDED.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This album is undoubtably one of the better albums to grace these ears. And what everyone says about the dj voices, thats thrown in, its an art form. Its the idea that this is all being heard on the radio. Get it? Appreciate it. \\"Josh Homme can't sing!\\" Yeah, and George Bush is a good president. This guys vocal chords are amazing, his guitar is spellbinding and justs contributes to this albums entirety of awesoemness. Don't like it? Don't buy it. Listen to it first, listen to the whole thing, like, really listen, get the music. It rocks.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I liked this film but did not lvoe it. I enjoyed the acting from every one espesially Keira Knightley(in her oscar nominated role), and Donald Sutherland who dose great. The film is good and entertaning and is a good time peice movie but at times lack's energy to keep the viewer happy. Overall the film is good to watch once and that's enough and the acting is great to watch.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|It's possible there has never been another band on the face of the planet that has gone through as many changes musically and with personnel as King Crimson.  An astounding wealth of talent has passed through this band since their beginnings ca. 1968. <br /> <br />Their extraordinarily diverse sounds throughout the years makes it impossible to say which album is the \\"best\\".  It is truly an apples and oranges comparison. <br /> <br />Personally, I prefer this era.  Starless and Bible Black was good.  Larks' Tongues in Aspic was utterly fantastic in its eccentricity, but Red is by and far their most incredible accomplishment.  Hard, dark, and eerie, Red captures a mood that was probably quite appropriate considering the band disintegrated in the summer of 1974. <br /> <br />This album doesn't display quite the bizarre behavior from Larks' Tonuges (think Larks' Tonuges Part 1), although Providence meanders a bit and could probably have been tightened up.  However, with Crimson you get what you get, and what you get is pretty damned good, even (or perhaps *especially*) when they were improvising. <br /> <br />The instrumental Red has been more or less a concert standard for them since they got back together in 1981, and with good cause.  Fallen Angel is beautifully dark, and One More Red Nightmare's frantic pace draws you in, making you want to listen over and over again. <br /> <br />I suppose part of the magic of this album may be the release these guys must have felt when their soundscape opened up after the departure of previous members.  Three-piece outfits with such talented musicians generally tend to overachieve.  Sometimes that's good and sometimes it's bad.  In Red's case, though, you just can't deny the brilliance of Bill Bruford's drum prowess, John Wetton's pounding bass and incredible \\"rock\\" voice.  I won't even bother to try to describe Fripp's presence.  If you know Crimson and Fripp, I don't have to explain.  If you don't, there's no way to describe it.You must listen. <br /> <br />This is a must have for any prog music fan.  End of story.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Better then the second but not as good as the first but it's still a great film from start to finish. the movie is a little diffrent from the book but they only change not important parts so the viewer should not be mad(but major fans of the book might be). The story is way more dark then the first two and the acting is getting better and better. The last 30min is so good words cant describe it. Again the harry potter series is great and it;s getting better and better. A must see movie.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is the best. I have watched it three or four times since I bought it a month ago. The movie gave much more background information than what is given in the Broadway performance. The music is amazing!
B00003CXI1|5.0|Wow, wow and wow what a movie. Being a fan of the books I could not wait to see this movie and when I did I was just blown away. One of the best films ever it's jsut great. You will be sucked into the world from start to finish. the acting is great the story is great it's jsut a great film. It's one movie you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. The best film of the year.
B000E8N690|4.0|by the end of the opening scene. something's wrong. You begin this thinking , just another music bio. At the end, the leads have won you over. A fine pic. Great music. How does he sound so much like the man?
B00008DDXC|5.0|Not as good as the first one but it's still great and is the best film of the year. The story it self is a little slow at points but the movie stays close to the book. The acting is great and the story is great it's more suspensfull, scary and mature then the first. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat espesially when harry is int he Chamber of secrets. The movie is so great words can hardly describe it.
B000301YY8|5.0|There's not much to say that hasn't already been written. Even though he's best known for the popular \\"You're Beautiful,\\" it is the rest of the album that makes this a must-have. the hauntingly beautiful \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" and the achingly sad \\"No Bravery\\" are sure to stay with the listener long after that songs have played. James Blunt is sure to become more than a pop idol. If he keeps his momentum, he's sure to become a legendary lyricist.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane, like many great films of the period, usually require the viewer to gather at least some information about the film and its creation in order for it to be understood what an achievement the film really is.  <br /> <br />Firstly, if you try watching the film for the first time without reading at least some information on it, then chances are probably you will think the film is boring. Like many old black and white films, modern viewers tend to think there boring because they lack many of the special effects the newer great films generally have. The film is old (1941) and the technology available to Welles (the director/writer/actor) was very limited. Also, some critics also believe that the film being in black and white also adds to the feeling that it maybe too long when in fact it is not. (The film is just shy of two hours). <br /> <br />Something that viewers should know about this is that the main subject of the film, though debated heavily by some, is generally agreed to be centered around the realities of the \\"American Dream\\". Succinctly, the dream of most Americans is too be born in extreme poverty (which was widespread at the time due to the great depression) and to grow up to be extremely successful which was personified at the time by being President.  <br /> <br />World War II made the possibility of the American Dream to many millions of Americans which is the reason why Welles choose to portray the realities of that dream in his film. Kane, the main character, like the actual president himself, due to his immense success becomes separated and isolated from his real friends. His isolation becomes so complete that he sometimes has difficultly telling who his real friends are. The motif that success might not bring about happiness was actually an original idea at the time and played a major part in Welles winning the Oscar for best original screenplay. <br /> <br />Now, the motif has been so commonly used in today's films that the average viewer won't be able to appreciate the originality in it. <br /> <br />The film is also noted for being highly innovative as well in that camera angels used and the advent of the \\"deep focus\\". The use of camera angels to portray Kane's feelings in the film was a major innovation at the time that mostly goes unnoticed by most because it is SOOOOO commonly used. (For instance if Kane is feeling powerful the camera angel would view him from a floor view to show the he feels taller than the rest of those around him. And if he feels isolated, the camera usually shoots him from an upwardly angel to personify him being small and insignificant). The deep focus is when the camera is initially focused on an object that is near the camera and then is shifted to focus on object that is away from the camera (usually in the background). American Beauty, The Silence of the Lambs, Titanic, virtually ALL films (including the best films) you can think of have used the \\"deep focus\\" somewhere in the film.  <br /> <br />Finally, this film is one of the precious few that actually benefit from multiple viewings. In fact, viewing this film more than one would probably be the only way you will be able to appreciate it, other than reading what has been written about it. I do agree though with what some viewers have said in that it is a major misfortune that it is considered to be the best film in history because many who do view it will try to criticize because of its immense critical acclaim.  <br /> <br />If you like flashy, big budget Action films, with battle scenes, and explosions happening all of the time (Independence Day, Armageddon, Godzilla to name a few), you probably wont enjoy this film and I recommend you don't see it. To the film critic who has seen tens of thousands of film's in their lifetime a film like Citizen Kane comes around once in a century.  <br /> <br />Citizen Kane is a film with a truly original story, (think of the plot in The Matrix), amazing film innovations (thinkof the sound use in Star Wars),  and spectacular acting (think of Charlize Theorn in Monster). If you can see that, then you will see why so many critic's around the world (even none English speaking ones!) consider this to be the greatest film in history.   <br /> <br />NOTE: Orson Welles is the only individual in history to be nominated for the most prestigious Academy Awards: Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, Best Screenplay write.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|tell them I ain't comin' back.  You can't take the sky from me. <br /> <br />That's how I feel about Firefly.  Wonderful show.  It grabbed ahold of me from the very first and won't let me go.   <br /> <br />Too bad there is only this season.  Boo hoo on Fox for canceling such a terrific, compelling, intelligent, humorous and immensely entertaining series.  At least there is the DVD set and of course the BDM, Serenity. <br /> <br />We need more!!!! <br /> <br />The 'Verse lives on.

0385504209|3.0|This one is really a page turner.  It is about a man named Robert LaFollet, an ornithologist who finds a code written on the beak of a rare penguin.  He takes this code to his friend Leonardo DaVinci who uses \\"the davinci effect\\" to descramble it.  It turns out that this code reveals a secret that \\"totally debunks religion\\".  Finally, with religion debunked once and for all, our hero runs to the helipad and flies off in his \\"ornith-copter\\".  Overall, it was good but the sad fact about this book is that I found it overrated.  Still, it presents important veiwpoins about religion and the nature of reality.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Take the frantic, scene-jumping weirdness of Time Bandits, a few of the more absurd elements of Shrek (you'll know them when you see them), and a great deal more of the 1990's remake of The Mummy than you might expect, put them in a food processer and blend them to a paste, then smear it on celluloid in a haphazard manner and you get a fair representation of The Brothers Grimm.  It is a hyperactive, disjointed movie that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up.<br /><br />That being said, there are (few) moments of real humor, and even a vague suggestion of something that was almost brilliant, but missed by a wide margin.<br /><br />Watch it, if you must, for a truly remarkable performance from Heath Ledger.
0898705525|5.0|One reviewer stated that G.K. Chesterton \\"sneaks up on you.\\"  This is an apt discription of ORTHODOXY.  G.K. Chesterton wrote this book for his critics and perhaps for himself.  Chesterton's written expression is charming, engaging, humorous, and effective.  Those who are skeptical of Cathilocism would benefit from this book if only to gain some insight into the Catholic Faith.  Even though they may disagree, they would learn something from good prose writing.    Chesterton begins his study by giving some of his intellectual background and early skepticism toward religion and especially Catholicism.  Readers should know that Chesterton was an agnostic and perhaps an athiest at an early age only to change his mind.  Chesterton is clear that he did not read Catholic Apologetics and that his sympathy for Catholicism did not originate from Catholic literature.  His intellectual journey came from the skeptics' literature.  He states in his ORTHODOXY the contradictions of the skeptics criticisms of Catholicism led him to the Faith.  He realized that Catholicism could not be two or three contradictions at the same time.      Chesterton also cites some of the saints, heroes, and heroines in Catholic history.  One good example is Joan of Arc.  Chesterton compares her to Nietzche and Tolstoy.  To paraphrase Chesterton, Joan of Arc was more violent than Nietzche who supposedly preached violence, and Joan of Arc was more sympathetic to peasants than Tolstoy if only because she was a peasant.    Chesterton deals with the supposed restrictions imposed by Catholic authorities over the millennia.  Chesterton is too simplistic in his remarks regarding this issue, but he does make sense.  The Catholic authorities imposed certain restrictions only to keep the Europeans from reverting into violent paganism and social chaos.      Chesterton also shows an appreciation for the cultural and intellectual contributions of Catholicism over the millennia.  He is very clear that the Catholic monks and teachers saved Western Civilization when barbarianism threatened to deluge Europeans without any hope of recovery.  It was the Catholic Church who literally saved Western Civilization and significantly improved it.  One must remember that it was the Catholic monks who literally hand copied books, wrote intellectual discourse, hand copied the Bible, etc.  The Catholic monks and nuns were the only teachers during the \\"Dark Ages\\" in Europe until the gradual rise of the Medieval Catholic universities beginning in the 11th century.    One should note that Chesterton did not engage in  ad hominem attacks in answering his critics.  He refuted his critics by effectively engaging their ideas and offered thoughtful responses.  This reviewer is not Catholic and to some may appear to be a skeptic.  However, this reviewer recognizes reasoned thinking and good writing.  Whether one is Catholic or not, this book is well worth reading.
0441003257|5.0|A delightfully amusing romp through the End of Days. <br /> <br />I actually laughted out loud every page or so and I am NOT a person who is easy to please.
B000008M54|4.0|I stumbled across this CD after reading a blip in Adventure Magazine; someone recommended The Waterboys for road trips.  I browsed Amazon and found that Fisherman's Blues got the best ratings, so I ordered it.  I can't believe it took me this long to discover this.  I love love love most of the songs...some are kinda stupid but then the rest are totally dreamy.  I played one song in particular for some friends and they were blown away.  I've read so-so reviews on other works by The Waterboys.  I think I hit the jackpot by choosing this one; it is currently my best friend.

0679777547|4.0|A few years ago, Roman Polanski made a film with Johnny Depp called \\"The Ninth Gate.\\"  It was stylish, intriguing, set in the unusual world of antique book collecting, with the same engaging elements of mystery that made \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" into bestsellers.  But the ending was absolutely unintelligible. <br /> <br />I was frustrated by the movie's end, and decided I'd read the novel from which the movie was made, with the goal of stitching the \\"real\\" ending to my memory of the movie.  The Club Dumas is that novel, and it turns out the movie was quite faithful to the main story, while leaving out a subplot that makes The Club Dumas successful as a novel.  Perez-Reverte's (translated) language is elegant, the \\"world\\" of the antique book brokers is fascinating, and the mysteries unfold in a page turning fashion, complete with glyphs and ancient wood carvings in which are buried nine secrets.  There are wonderful, dark, dusty libraries interlaced with threads of threat, a thrum of sub-rosa but palpable sexuality (overt in places), and the promise of things supernatural.  Many of the characters made me smile, as they were textured in the duality style (part sinner, part saint) reminiscent of the great characters from \\"Casablanca.\\"  While the characters aren't quite 3 dimensional, they are close...let's say they are 2.75 dimensional (perhaps Stephen Hawking can explain that.)  The twists are, for the most part, exciting and surprising, although I suspect true mystery addicts will spot the big twist at the end when our hero...(no.  I'm not going to spoil it.) <br /> <br />And speaking of the end, it is important to note that the end of this novel is where it parts from the manner (and success) of The Da Vinci Code.  The latter fed the standard American need for an END (all capitals) that is unequivocal (and generally upbeat).  I confess I mostly like an exciting story with twists and turns to actually end with an END. <br /> <br />The Club Dumas doesn't END, it just ends. I wasn't disappointed, exactly, but be advised the ending is on the soft side, perhaps reflecting a European sensibility.  It was not a bad ending by any means.  But, as a typical American, I would have slightly preferred an END. <br /> <br />In sum: A stylish, intelligent mystery with supernatural elements, a look into a rarely seen, subterranean profession, tasty characters, mature writing, intertwined sub-plots, with a mostly satisfying end.  Recommended.
B000003S5H|4.0|in a good way.  A great background album (I mean that as a complement) that sometimes gets a little kitschy.
B0001I561E|2.0|I was about 12 when I saw this in the theater back in '92, and got the soundtrack close to the same time (between myself and my brother, i guess we just about wore the CD out).  When the VHS came out, I was very shocked to notice that the first line of the first song had been dubbed over -- it sounds to me, even to this day, as if some random editor in the back room of the studio paused the tape, plugged in a 5-dollar microphone, and sang some new lyrics he'd just written on-the-spot.  The original words, \\"where they cut off your ear...\\" is racist only to people with no sense of dry humor or wit.  Add to this insult the fact that it sounds as bad as if some line of the genie's had been replaced by dialogue spoken by richard simmons.  you get the idea. <br /> <br />Hopefully someday Disney will see fit to release films *at least* uncensored, if not with their original artwork (multiple versions are possible on DVD, why not use this feature sometimes?).  Until then, I'm not wasting my money.
B000005DQR|4.0|but not the amazing classic some of the hype may lead you to believe (maybe it was at its initial release.)  Either way, it's a great album with great beats and well worth the $6 I got it for on ebay.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|An Amazon critic review for a prior Sigur Ros CD wrote, \\"The group continues to mix the most interesting aspects of U2 (the anthem), Low (the maximalist slow-mo thing), Radiohead (the utter lack of irony in the quest to make meaningful art for stadium crowds), and My Bloody Valentine (guitar as texture), while not sounding like anyone else on this planet.\\" Well, nitpicking here as is my right as a pedant, let's substitute Slowdive for My Bloody Valentine (don't hate me because I'm beautiful, Valentwined accolytes).<br /><br />Need an example?  Fine. Take U2's \\"With or Without You\\", Low's \\"Pissing\\", Radiohead's \\"Let Down\\", Slowdive's \\"Spanish Air\\", and a boys' choir singing in some undecipherable (to my ears) language once used to usher Vikings to Valhalla, get an ouija board to channel Phil Spector and produce a tsunamic wall of sound, mix well (you're gonna need an concrete-mixer truck to get all the production layers), and viola (the expression, not the instrument), you've got Sigur Ros' joyfully brooding anthemic Icelandic pop...and yes, I used joy and brood together. Really, the bass is making a brooding sound on these tracks, but this stuff is joyful, not what's playing when you starting playing with razor blades.<br /><br />\\"Glosoli\\" and \\"Saeglopur\\" are the epic and standout tracks. With \\"Takk\\", the genie's out of the bottle<br /><br />BTW, when visiting various sites in the attempt to ascertain if the titles are Icelandic or Hopelandic, I ran across a message board wherein some guy concluded his postings with the slogan, \\"When I am king, you will be first against the wall.\\" Ah, good times...
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Grab this one!  The entire family enjoys it, very nicely mixed and edited.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The music sung by these women is fantastic.  I've enjoyed listening to the songs over and over.  All of their voices are beautiful. If you enjoy uplifting music you will enjoy this album.
B00005JKC3|5.0|The Hulk is amazing. Did you guys know that Eric Bana has the same last name as the REAL name of the Hulk (Banner)? Spooky. <br /> <br />The Hulk is back and bigger than ever. Also, whenever he grows big, all of his clothes split off except for his trousers. This must be because they are made of stretch elastic. The Hulk walks the street alone, doomed for all eternity. He is an amazing fighter. Which begs the question: Who would win in a fight, The Hulk or Saddam? I guess since they have captured Saddam but not the Hulk we'll never know. Unless the Hulk comes out of hiding and seeks out Saddam. That would be interesting. <br /> <br />Then again, imagine if they met up and joined sides and The Hulk released Saddam... we'd all be stuffed. That's not good. If only Spiderman were real! The only web he spins nowadays is a web of deceit.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|Robbie is incredible!  I received this CD as a gift.  How lucky am I?  My gift to you fellow Americans is to treat yourself to an unplayed, undiscovered talent in this country.  I cannot wait to see this guy if and when he comes to America.  Robbie, if you read this, I need two tickets and backstage passes in Atlanta so I can meet your talented self!   <br /> <br />This CD is so diversified.  Advertising space is one of the prettiest ballads I have ever heard and would be a great promo for Gentleman Jack.  \\"A place to crash\\" has a Stones feel to it. It made me want to get up and do a Mick Jagger dance.  I feel a remix coming out of this one.  You also have \\"King of Bloke and Bird\\".  This song would make Pink Floyd proud! <br /> <br />Oh my GOD!  \\"Make me Pure\\"   This song moved me to tears!  It's telling God to make him pure, but just not yet.  This is something that I could relate to, but never heard anyone write about and with the angelic choir in the background, it touched me deeply. <br /> <br />Robbie, Robbie, Robbie, you are truly a gift! <br />
B000035Z1Z|4.0|I'm writing this review for people who want to know how they could possibly get this fantastic movie for such a cheap price.  First, let me say that I love this movie.  I have owned it on VHS for years and have finally replaced it on DVD.   <br /> <br />There aren't any special features on this disc other than a theatrical trailer.  That's fine with me - I wasn't expecting much for $5.99.  However, the picture quality is a little grainy in comparison to today's DVD releases - I suppose because the movie is 11 years old and they just slapped it on a DVD without any kind of remastering of the picture quality.  Again, not really a problem for me because I like the movie so much.   <br /> <br />My main concern was with the subtitles.  There are several conversations in the film that take place in French.  The English subtitles on this DVD are piece-meal at best.  By that I mean it will display the first half of a sentence but not the second half.  If I had not seen this movie many times already and knew what was being said, I would have missed half the conversations, sometimes containing important-to-the-plot information.   <br /> <br />Maybe there is a way you can set your TV to have English subtitles up all the time and it will overlap the poor quality ones on here.  Or maybe it is a technical problem with my DVD - who knows!  I just thought people should know what they're getting when they buy this version of the film.   <br /> <br />For the record - I still love this movie!  Ryan & Kline are fantastic!
B0002OERI0|5.0|One of the top 10 CDs I own.  \\"THE BEST CD OF THE DECADE\\"!!! <br />I am totally amazed at the Genious of this CD.  I can only describe it as the \\"early WHO\\" meet pink floyd's kiss your songs together and crosses with the Ramones.  I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS!!!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!   Don't wanna be an American idiot.................You guys should have won the 2005 grammy for album of the year and not \\"U know who 2\\".
B00004Z459|5.0|Personally, I believe that this album, LP's debut, is the original and best with REANIMATION coming in a close second. METEORA is only third because... actually, I can't find a reason. I know! Cause it's the third album. Anyway, Listen to it like this could be the last album you ever listen to. You'll then be able to appreciate the genius of Chester, Mike, and the crew in full. There will NEVER be anything as good as LP. PEACE!
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Truly enjoy this CD, my favorite song \\"Save the last dance for me\\"
B00005OM4K|5.0|Does the booklet or the liner notes include good session info, such as when, where, who played, etc. on each track?
B000301YY8|5.0|This guy has a sort of Preaching Choir Voice that is soothing... and the tunes are smooth. A must have if you like Brit Army inspired music (if there is such thing).
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I went to see this in the theater,and then refreshed my memory as to its sheer awfulness by watching it again on an airplane flight. The worst feature of the film is the script, with its utterly tin-eared adaptation of Austen's brilliant dialogue. The casting, acting, costumes and attempts to represent daily life in the Regency are also really, really bad. Austen's Eliza Bennett is a rather sharp-tongued young lady, but Keira Knightley plays her as an out and out boor. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett has to be one of the most inappropriate pieces of casting I've ever seen. The filmmakers seem to think that Regency gentlemen lived like Albanian peasants of the same era -- e.g., see the scene in which Donald Sutherland is seen following a large pig into the pigsty which is actually attached to the Bennetts' house. Elizabeth and Darcy play the climactic love scene outside, in their jammies. If you want to watch an adaptation that is true to Austen, buy the DVD of the wonderful 1980 BBC \\"P&P\\" with Elizabeth Garvie as Eliza Bennett. Everything about it -- cast, acting, script -- is perfect. <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Seldom does a movie, especially a musical, capture my heart so much that I enjoy watching it again and again!  This movie is absolutely beautiful, the music, the casting, the set, I love it all.  Even my husband, who is not a fan of musicals usually, goes around the house singing the tunes from the movie.  I may have to get another copy because I'm sure I will wear this copy out!

B000000W6F|4.0|From the very first song, \\"I Am One,\\" it was easy to tell that Billy Corgan and his bandmates had to be reckoned with.  With thrumming guitars and bass, distinctive vocals of Corgan, and the capacity to go from 0 to 60 and back again with astonishing ease, \\"The Smashing Pumpkins\\" were indeed unique.  \\"Gish\\" is the first of a remarkable trilogy of albums, which includes the epic \\"Siamese Dreams,\\" and concludes with the sprawling \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\"  After that, unfortunately, the band/Corgan couldn't seem to elevate to its/his former glory.    \\"I Am One,\\" \\"Siva,\\" \\"Bury Me,\\" and \\"Fristessa\\" represent the harder side of the \\"Smashing Pumpkins.\\"  These songs are really quite similar, but all good, albeit not as excellent as \\"Cherub Rock,\\" \\"Quiet,\\" and \\"Geek U.S.A.\\" from their next album.  Out of the slower tracks (and, of course, the band often dramatically changes pace within the same song) my favorites are \\"Rhinoceros,\\" and \\"Crush,\\" which again, aren't quite as good as \\"Disarm,\\" and \\"Today,\\" from \\"Siamese Dreams.\\"  I get the feeling that \\"Window Paine,\\" which curiously includes a \\"Bolero\\"-like portion, was supposed to be the Pumpkins show stopper, but never became that.  If one added heavy feedback to \\"Daydream\\" (sung by D'Arcy), it could almost sound like something from \\"My Bloody Valentine.\\"    After releasing \\"Mellon Collie,\\" the Smashing Pumpkins could have assumed the mantel of one of the greatest rock bands in the world.  But, unfortunately, they never did.

B000023VR6|5.0|That's the only word to describe this album. Classic pretty much sums it all up. This album is so good it should be considered one of the best rap albums ever released. Dre left rap with a bang... this will leave you wanting more. Every beat on here is outstanding and every featured artist is great. The skits are funny and you can listen to the whole album without hitting skip. Best songs are The Watcher, Still D.R.E., Xxplosive, What's The Difference?, Forgot About Dre, Next Episode, Murder Ink and every other song. If you are a west coast rap fan this is f*cking mandatory.

0671027344|3.0|This was a fast read, and an \\"ehhh\\" sort of book. To me the author was trying too much to be like J.D. Salinger, and his character like Holden Caulfield. The narration is very similar, and the character even use some out-right Holden Caulfield expressions. It was decent, but it was no Catcher in the Rye.

0684824906|5.0|Having read numerous books on Lincoln, the history of his political career and his personal history I was hesitant to pick up this massive agenda (near 800 pages)with hopes of finding anything new or refreshingly revealing. My fears proved to be pleasantly wrong. The study of the interacting of Lincoln and his cabinet in this book sheds light on the political savvy of Lincoln, he was not just some back woods lawyer who got lucky and fell into the presidency. Providence placed him in office and was his guide, but his own wit, intelligence and plain good sense and the ability to work with those opposed to him in a positive manner bore out his greatness.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|This movie is amazing.  I have heard of Johnny Cash but never a big fan of it.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were brilliant.  The story and direction of the movie was great.    They both deserved to be nominated for the Oscars.  Hoping for them to win.  Excellent flick.  Check it out.
B0000033WC|4.0|Though I have known this album for 30 years, I bought the 'fully loaded' cd for the extra tracks. that's OK and no complaints. But - and maybe this is a just a quibble - BECAUSE I know the work so well, and because the song sequences and kicks are engraved in my mind, I found the 'new, full' versions of both 'Sweet janer and Rock'n'Roll spoiled by resotoration. In fact, in Sweet Jane, the great kick at the end of the song has now been removed and an extra ??16 bars??? of doodling appear.Obviously, if you don't know the original, this will not be important, but I feel the 'fully loaded' versions should have been on the bonus disc, and not slotted into the albuim, as those two 'originals' are gone for ever. <br />I actually got rid of this version and went back to the original.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, both Phoenix and Witherspoon have proven that they have excellent talent and can capture their audience.  Though I am sure there are some parts of Cash's life that weren't focused on ( didn't he actually go to jail on one point?) I felt that the showing his of his undying love for June and his addiction to pills/alcohol was excellently portrayed. Also the tragic death of his older brother Jack, I found heartwrenching.  The acting is great, the two actors really did a great job at singing and performing Cash/Carter's classic songs.  What I loved is that they didn't try and make Cash/Carter seem perfect and their \\"love story\\" effortless and easy.  June is married/divorced a couple times and you see her take insults for it and how weary it makes her to love/marry Cash.  The only thing I wonder is how was Cash's first wife Viv portrayed and who did they get the information from.  Viv seemed very selfish and unsupportive and I was curious if this is how she actually was all the time, somehow I doubt it.  Still the movie really is about June and John, loving eachother and being best friends and finally overcoming everything.  It breaks my heart that John died only four months after June passed away.  Maybe you can die from a broken heart.  You should see this movie, Phoenix doesn't impersonate Cash, he embodies him and Witherspoon shows us she can really, truly act.

DON'T GET ME WRONG THERE STILL MY FAVORITE BAND, RYCHE AND ROLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL..
B00005AQEA|5.0|The edit in this CD is awful. Better Dayz and Until The End Of Time are the same way except only the words are reversed and not the background track. What they mean by \\"digitally remastered\\" is all songs were converted into stereo 2 format, reducing hiss and making the sound more crisp & clear.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the holy grail is without a doubt on the essental comedies of all time. This Comedy Classic is one of my top 10 movies. The whole movie is about King Arther and his knights (Gallahad, Sir Robin, Lancealot, Sir Not appearing in this film, ect) and there quest for the holy grail and also to find out if a 1 ounce swallow can carry a one pound coconut. You also have classic characters like The French Guards, The Knights who say ni, The evil Rabbit, The Black Beast of AAGGGHHHHHH, and don't forget Tim the enchanter. This movie is what is one of the greatest comedies. Possibly the best Python Movie of the 3. Get this movie I highly recomendit.
B0000025KI|4.0|Great album.  When is this (and the rest of Springsteen's catalog for that matter) going to be remastered and be available with a decent sound?
0062502182|5.0|In many ways, this book is too simplistic.  A good story does not need to be fancy.  A story only needs to touch the soul of the reader.  Any dreamer can easily identify with or be touched by this story.    Santiago journeys across two continents, is robbed three times, meets people of varying backgrounds, and sees the great pyramids.  All of this is part of the pursuit of his personal legend.  The key figure that Santiago meets is the Alchemist.  This man is so in touch with the soul of the world, that he has lived for 200 years.  These gifts he received by following his heart and dreams.  The Alchemist's ultimate purpose is to  help Santiago get in touch with his potential.    The simplistic writing and short length of this book should attract many readers.  Because of the book's depiction of Muslims, I am suprised that it has maintained popularity after 10 years in publication.
B00005JO04|3.0|Why did Clooney go to the trouble of gaining weight for his part? Would have thought a CIA guy needed to keep in shape. <br /> <br />Judging by Woodman's cynical speech, the ending is supposed to imply that the black man is kept down for the same reason as the Arab street and the black father's son is nothing more than an Uncle Tom. Only the CIA guy and the terrorist guy have 'honour' by not submitting to being Capitalist serfs. <br /> <br />Where Syriana went completely off the rails is the moment where the reformist Arab prince extoles the equality of women to a room full of influential Arabs who nod sagely in agreement. Yeah, right. Westerners really need to belatedly wake up to the reality that Islam is the loaf of bread in the Middle East. The idea that this western educated prince with a PHD would take back all the 'true' values of America (i.e Liberal), and be against all the 'imperial' values (i.e Conservative) is pretty laughable. <br />Also no mention of the Palestine/Israeli conflict is a serious admission. What's Hezbollah doing in Beirut anyway? <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I rather took to this film. It was serene and restful apart from one scene. You'd have to be the reincarnation of Ted Bundy to find that bit restful.
0142000663|5.0|John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath stands as the greatest piece of literature from the Depression era.  No other work is as effective in portraying life at that time.  The Joad family's struggle and journey are remarkably vivid to the reader, as Steinbeck makes it impossible not to sympathize with them.  Steinbeck's writing style, as usual, makes for a great read, as he goes back and forth between the Joads and a kind of sweeping overview of the attitudes and effects of the Depression overall.  But it is the Joads story that is really the meat of this incredible tale.  I fully reccommend it to anyone; few works have had such a great influence and mark on American literature.
0786890754|2.0|I bought the book because I thought it could potentially be a great idea.  Boy was I disappointed.  It was very slow, and I really did not care much for the characters!  A bit of a disappointment.
B00005M91K|5.0|This film has a trancendental quality that draws its viewers out of the immediate world around them and allows them become one with the world. What I liked most about the film is that, even though there is no central plot, it demands much from the viewer. I sat there and found myself asking question after question. I also appreciate that it avoids being a sappy environmental film by being critical of unchecked urbanization and what it is doing to the human soul. It pleased me greatly that the students from our school also walked away with the desire to ask \\"the good questions\\". I highly recommend this film.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|As a fan of early Pink Floyd I've always grooved on this movie. What a fascinating idea: Britain's premier psychedelic band creates one of their greatest performances for 2000-year old ghosts once buried alive by the smoldering ash of Mt. Vesuvius in an amphitheatre once host to gladiators' battles. Sure, choppy editing breaks up the concert's trance spell too many times with unilluminating interviews and studio sessions, and while I love the volcano footage, seeing the band hike over a steaming lava field in their heeled leather boots is too reminiscent of a \\"Spinal Tap\\" escapade.  While it is fascinating to see \\"The Dark Side\\" under construction in the studio (even better, buy \\"The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon\\" DVD for much more behing-the-scenes production), it is also bittersweet to see the last of Pink Floyd's days of innocence before the overwhelming success of \\"The Dark Side\\" changed bassist Roger Waters from a burnt-out angelic bard into a spoiled and raging lunatic aka \\"The Wall\\".  Therefore, this movie inadvertantly captures the fragile personality balance of a wonderful group of musicians before they exploded into the Big Time beyond their wildest expectations.  \\"The Director's Cut\\" has many more interviews than in the original movie, and only a die-hard Pink Floyd fan will be able to sit through it more than once.  I highly recommend buying it for the Features section, which contains the Pompeii concert footage without any interviews or studio sessions.  Its much easier to connect to the profundity of nature's wrath, the fleeting fragility of life, and the grand artistic achievements of Roman civilization without being interupted by Richard Wright ordering pie at the Abbey Studios canteen.
0783219695|5.0|It's somewhat rare when a movie based on a factual event is both entertaining and factually accurate -- Apollo 13 is one of those rare movies.  For those who are old enough to remember the Apollo 13 flight, it gives details that were not known by the public at the time, but it is a suspenseful and well acted movie for all.
0316172324|5.0|How really do we hit a baseball travelling at a 100 miles per hour without performing a complex calculation?  Chance, luck, training, sub-conscious activity? <br /> <br />This book will lead you into questioning how we see and understand ourselves. EXCELLENT! <br /> <br />It is a little of everything I guess and while pattern matching neural nets and experience are plausible, there is something more, I am sure. Is it soem spiritual source or theunexplained quantum physical ability of our brain? <br /> <br />Intriguing thoughts indeed. A very enjoyable novel that builds on those concepts and made me wonder is 'Journey To Eden' by Max Pucher. Not for everyone but very courageous ideas.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I wanted to explore the story of the matrix more than just watch the movies.  This is the complete package.  It contains everything; all three movies, behind the scenes information, how they put the movies together and more background on the storyline.  Overall, this is an excellent boxed set.  It contains everything a Matrix fan could want.  It is a very thought provoking story and this product contains a lot of material to \\"think about\\".  It is very entertaining.
B000957O82|5.0|I really enjoyed Hitch. Will Smith & Kevin James, (TV's \\"The King of Queens\\") are awesome. It's laugh-out-loud funny, has romance & drama as well. Great movie over all, in my opinion. You decide.
B000BNI95Y|5.0|I really enjoy listening to Bebe's music, it's liberating and fresh. <br />
0800141660|5.0|As a fan of Jane Austin books, I was delighted with this adaptation of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\". The essentials were there, and the acting (from my untutored point of view) was delightful. I have no tolerance for language, sexual innuendo, or vulgarity in films and was glad there was none.  I throughly enjoyed the 2 hours, and friends and neighbors to whom I have loaned the DVD since say they have also enjoyed it.
B0007M22TI|5.0|The DVD is awesome, especially the interviews with the ladies. The only complaint I have is that it took a long time to ship.
B000E33VWW|4.0|The success of this film relies heavily on the performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote, Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith.  This film is a dramatized biopic of Capote's relationship with convicted killer Perry Smith, which leads Capote to write In Cold Blood, arguably the first nonfiction novel. <br /> <br />I admit that I initially thought Hoffman was mocking Capote's sexual orientation and effeminate mannerisms.  But Hoffman was very true to the real Capote, and as the movie progressed, I believed Hoffman's performance completely. <br /> <br />Keener gives an understated performance as Harper Lee.  She is at once Capote's companion, fellow author, admirer, and mother figure.  Given that there are long periods in the film when Lee is not with Capote, Keener's ability to make Lee's influence on Capote felt is a credit to both Keener and Hoffman. <br /> <br />Collins, Jr. nearly steals the movie.  His complex performance as Perry Smith hits every emotion perfectly.  The chemistry between Collins, Jr. and Hoffman is spectacular.  Although Hoffman is the film's star and Capote was certainly a self-centered man, the viewer believes wholeheartedly that Capote would sympathize with Smith and even fall in love with him; thus, it's very appropriate that Hoffman lets Collins, Jr. take control of pivotal scenes. <br /> <br />Capote's proximity to the subjects of his work challenges the \\"nonfiction-ness\\" of In Cold Blood, but no one can say that the novel isn't a book of truth.  Likewise, the viewer of this film perhaps comes away somewhat confused about the moral character of Capote, but this in no way detracts from the truths about Capote in this wonderful film.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I was an emotional wreck after watching the movie. Couldn't stop crying for a long time. It was exqusitely subtle in its treatment of the ocean deep and almost mystic bond between Ennis and Jack. The movie told more where it left off in details. No into your face theatrics at all. Both the short story and the movie kept the narration away from the epicentre of what the 2 men were really feeling. Only occasionallly were the boiling and roiling emotions of the characters broke thru the surface and the audience was thus devastated by the sudden revelation of the crushing weight that the 2 men were carrying on the shoulders and in their hearts. I thank Annie and Ang for telling such an exceedingly moving story in such a poetic way. I hope people world over can realize via the movie that love between 2 men could be every bit as pure, dignified and precious as love between a man and a woman. <br /> <br />Finally, truth be told, having 2 very gd-looking guys playing Ennis and Jack did help a great deal. The ethereal and majestic setting of Brokeback Mountain (Canada's Ablerta?) didn't hurt, either.
0385495323|5.0|This book is FANTASTIC. It details the cat and mouse game between codemakeres and codebreakers in a very lucid and intersting manner. It will make you appreciate the role of intelligence in warfare even more, and you will know about people and facilities who have influenced the course of world war 2 as much as aircrafts and battleships. <br /> <br />This book really very interesting and informative and anyone who just wanna read a book just for kiling time should grab this one.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I'm getting older and so are my favorites.  There are only a few of today's newer artists (not from the 60' or 70's) that I might spend money on (Black Crowes, Sheryl Crow) so I look for new or rare albums by my favorites.  I also look for albums I may have overlooked when I was younger.<br /><br />With Mighty ReArranger I think it's the best new rock album I have heard in years.  I have never been too crazy about Robert Plant solo works but this is one that really shocked me.  I love it.<br /><br />Plant's vocals and band are terrific.  There is enough guitar to make me happy and plenty of 'light and shade' which I love.  This could have been a Zeppelin album.
0060512806|5.0|An incredibly well written book, a must have for any geek. Even at 1100+ pages you won't want it to end. Stephenson's use of the english language and understanding of mathematics and computer science are equal to none in the literary world.
B0007ACVHI|5.0|There is genius in this recording. I think it is a masterpiece. The sound is impeccable, round, alive. It is as if the music is speaking to you directly, being born right in front of you. Magnificent.
B00005QW5X|4.0|Hedwig and the Angry Inch is reminiscent of Rocky Horror Picture Show. I watched Hedwig and within 20 minutes of viewing I was ready to add the DVD and the Soundtrach to my collection. I have been a Rocky Horror Picture fan since I was ten...dancing around in black thigh highs and six inch black heels. Now I am gonna have to buy the blonde feathered wig and sing along to the soundtrack I just purchased.
B000000W5L|2.0|Although every full-on full-tilt Stones fan I know digs this as their favorite Stones LP, I could never get with this album, and Lord knows I've tried.  That said, Tumblin' Dice is one of the great Stones songs.  But too many songs hit one groove, and STAY THERE.  There is pretty much nothing in the way of dynamics for many of the tunes.  A lot of the imagery is pretty gross - and I usually dig the outlandishness of the boys.  But here it just feels lazy and...pointless.  None of the righteous ridiculousness of Shattered, and none of the ragged beauty of Wild Horses.  I know people love this album in a very protective way, like they do their little brother.  I ain't got a brother and I don't love this album.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This is not a sucessor of the first Final Fantasy movie, Spirits Within, as most of the FF games of the series they don't have any connection in the story.<br /><br />This is a sucessor of the FF VII game, a little hard to follow for the people who didn't play, but good enough to be a story itself.<br /><br />Amazing adventure, full of action, great image and sound.
0156027321|5.0|I have recommended this book to everyone. It is fascinating. It is truly a post-modern tale that allows you to search for meaning and truth yourself. This book is a story told by a great storyteller. I think to get the most of this book you should read up and become familiar with literary theory, however the story in itself can be fun as well.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|As a technical tour de force Peter Jackson's re-make of the classic 1933 \\"King Kong\\" has some merit, but as a humdinger of a story with thrills and chills the original has the new film beaten by a mile. How ironic, in that director Jackson and his screen writers had the blueprint of the original script in the palm of their hands, yet they managed to emerge with a film that never took off: the story meandered all over the place. The early New York City scenes were duly impressive but as with everything else in the movie, done to excess. As the movie went on the promise of a major motion picture event evaporated and the film became an endurance test on the hindquarters. Here is a film where the hype took precedence over actual achievement. Jackson's Kong is a movie so enamored of its subject , so filled with \\"in references\\" to Old Hollywood and Broadway (granted, amusing up to a point) that it lays there like the huge monster's corpse at the film's finale. There is no forward momentum, no real character development, and absolutely no chemistry between the lovely Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody. who is badly miscast. The original \\"King Kong\\" remains the definitive version of this story.
B0001LJCPC|3.0|i too wish i had been more careful and read the reviews, then i would have noticed all the missings songs and that the main one i wanted ( navajo joe - ennio morricone --bills exit ) was not on there. i still would have bought it but would not have been so dissapointed when i got to the end. i also feel very cheated. <br />what is the point of bringing out a soundtrack and missing out songs? should it not be all of them? <br />i feel bills exit music was a key song that should not have been missed off, as this scene is the whole point of the films, when she finally gets her revenge and should not have been missed. <br /> <br />worth buying but a dissapointment <br />
1881273156|4.0|I recently bought this book for my fiancee for Valentines Day because I thought it would be good for the both of us to read although I wasn't sure he actually would.  He did read it, however, and found it very helpful and informative.  I am now in the process of reading it and am enjoying the insights into how to truly express your love for the person you love.  I would highly reccomend this book to couples!
B000268QB2|3.0|While I can't say Keane's music is bad, I can't say it is good either. It burbles along pleasantly but never engages me enough to either run screaming to the CD player in order to pulverize it, or to really be captivated by their piano driven pop musings. Rather Keane choogles along like Clodplay without all the troubling testosterone to form some kind of beige aural wallpaper. S'ok, two thumbs sideways.

B000000OSE|5.0|Listen, I was born when this album came out and this has one of my favorite songs of all time, November Rain. It's one of my favorite GNR songs besides Civil War from Illusion 2. Both songs just rock. To me, better than Sweet child o mine, or even Paradise City. other than that, a few other songs are good but that one is the best. Buy now.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Anyone who has an adventurous taste in rock music should check these guys out. They've easily become one of my favorite bands and I've put them in the same league as Tool in terms of putting out cutting edge rock music. This album takes a lot of patience but it can really grow on you. It definitely falls on the artsier side of things, so fans of more commercial rock might not get into this. They will typically provide minutes of intense music and then throw 6 or 7 minutes of trippy effects and odball freakouts at you. When you hear these guys you may think they have some kind of drug problem, and I mean that in a good way. If you are new to the band then I don't recommend this album as an introduction though. The previous album, \\"De-loused\\"  might be a better record to get eased into their style, and is an equally strong album which features Flea on bass. For folks that are into long albums that feature many peaks and valleys, such as Tool's Lateralus, then both albums are highly recommended.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|When Saw was first released, who knew it would become such a hit and much talked about movie. Most of us now know the whole story behind this movie so I won't go into the details but I will say that I truly enjoyed this movie. Great movie for horror fans. With a great storyline of teaching people the value of life thru the eyes of Jigsaw, a very deranged man, Saw really delivers. The grisly violence adds to the success of this movie. It leaves you asking yourself.... what would you do to save your own life?? Cool scenes with an ending leaving you to wonder if there will be a sequel. We all know now that there was. Saw II is also a great film which I reviewed. I'd have to say that I preferred Saw II over Saw I but both are sure to be never forgotten horror movies!!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|As a long-time lover of this film, I had high hopes for this DVD set, and Disney didn't let me down.<br /><br />Disc 1 is the beautifully restored movie, as promised, in full- or widescreen (I'm sure everyone chooses widescreen, and with good reason. The long panoramic scenes contain things off to either side that you never would've seen given only fullscreen.)<br /><br />Disc 2 is the real trove of Lady & the Tramp information. It's all neatly divided up into four categories.<br /><br />Under \\"Deleted Scenes,\\" you get an interesting sample of a scene removed from the film that would have been a little strange, I think, for this movie. Tramp conjures up a world where dogs walk around on their hind legs and treat humans as silly pets. Then after that, there's an elongated version of the baby's arrival.<br /><br />Under \\"Music and More,\\" there's a `Bella Notte' music video and a feature on the Siamese cat song that's pretty neat. Originally there was going to be the line, \\"We are former resident of Siam; there are no finer cat than I am.\\" I wonder why they chose to remove that, as I think it's a good lyric, and its rejection isn't explained.<br /><br />The last two categories are by far the best.<br /><br />\\"Games and Activities\\" contains the DVD-ROM Virtual Puppy game. I tried it out; cute, for kids (obviously). I've seen many such adoptables online, with little `happiness' meters onscreen. I suppose the choices of Trusty, Jock, Lady, Tramp, or Bull make a decent selection. I think I was hoping to see a Peg puppy. But never mind that.<br /><br />The Disney Dog Trivia Game is one of the best bonus DVD features I've ever seen. It's a rather addicting virtual board game which actually takes one to four players through a realistic board game set-up; there's a spinner, multiple-choice question categories, and spaces you don't want to land on. The board is shaped like a dog bone and has various areas for various Disney dog movies, including Oliver and Company, 101 Dalmatians, and The Fox and the Hound. My complaint is that there really should be a `hard' level, and the questions get asked over and over. The questions do range from easy ones about the most popular Disney canines to more obscure ones I've never even heard of.<br /><br />The PuppyPedia video is an amusing and educational clip of Fred Willard in a dog park, and I was impressed at the variety of breeds shown.<br /><br />The \\"Inner Bark\\" personality quiz attempts to match you with your Lady & the Tramp character profile, but while the questions are fun and have many creative answers, I've run into issues with the results. I can't seem to get anything other than Bull, Jock, Trusty, a couple of Si & Ams, and one Lady. Even when I deliberately try to get Tramp, I never do; further, I wish to know exactly how many choices they've got and who the characters are, because they've got such a nice variety of questions and answers that it would be a shame if they only used certain characters as possible results.<br /><br />The \\"Backstage Disney\\" portion of Disc 2 is chock full of fascinating stuff, if you care at all about this movie. It's great because it doesn't just talk about things in terms of Lady and the Tramp--it feels like a brief history of the Disney studios, in relation to its other productions. Yet it does focus enough on the movie at hand.<br /><br />The segments begin with a touching story of Walt's childhood and goes on to interesting discussions of all aspects of Lady and the Tramp's development and creation. You also get storyboards and excerpts from some Disney TV broadcasts. `The Making of Lady and the Tramp' itself is nearly an hour in length and presents many, many things that I did not know and am glad that I now do. My personal favorite trivia tidbit I learned was that in one old concept of the story, Lady had two suitors--a Russian Wolfhound named Boris and a mongrel named Homer. How nice to see where my favorite pound puppy came from.<br /><br />Of this andcountless other developmental ideas are included gallery images on the disc as well, and the remaining thing I didn't quite touch on is the section of three theatrical trailers. Normally not all that exciting, I found the oldest trailer to be quite outstanding; it actually fills you in on all the characters, in a rather historical context. For examples, Trusty is said to be a Bloodhound from the old south given to dreams of faded glory; Boris a remnant of the old aristocracy, and fellow `boy in the back room' dog pound-dweller Pedro had his `visa and luck run out at the same time.'<br /><br />So I already knew this movie was an A+; but I can safely say the Platinum Edition gets the same grade.countless other developmental ideas are included gallery images on the disc as well, and the remaining thing I didn't quite touch on is the section of three theatrical trailers.

B00005JLKN|4.0|We all know the movie and story of The Silence Of The Lambs. I reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me, it is one of the best films ever made. Now, with Red Dragon, I give it 4 stars but I think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is.... Anthony Hopkins, the brilliant actor who plays Hannibal Lecter. I don't think this movie would have been as good if Hopkins wouldn't have played the role of Lecter. I own the original Manhunter, which is an older movie and it was good but Hopkins can not be beat for the Hannibal Lecter role. This is a great thriller film!! Edward Norton delivers a very good performance as retired FBI agent Will Graham. When a series of serial killing style murders start, Graham is called out of retirement to help the FBI catch the killer known as \\"The Tooth Fairy\\". He eventually seeks the aid of Lecter to help him find who this killer is. Like Silence Of The Lambs, we find Graham visiting Lecter in his maximum security facility. Very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence. This movie holds true to the book with the same name. We get to see Lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in S.O.T.L. Without going further into all the details of the movie, I'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after S.O.T.L. and the movie Hannibal. Also, Ralph Fiennes delivers a good performance as the Red Dragon. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, it's a must see!!!!
0307276902|5.0|Regardless of the hype about some things being fictional I can honestly tell you having known several people with addictions that this book really does hit home.  I also believe that addicts who read this book will benefit just knowing that other people out there have gone through the same thing or worse.
6305718954|3.0|Always seeking a good horror film, I bought this movie at a good price. Of course, it's 7 years old now! Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne deliver good performances in this thriller of a movie. Arquette plays Frankie, a woman of little faith who doesn't believe in God. Her life is forever changed when one day, she starts to show the signs of Stigmata.... the wounds of Christ after being crusified. A priest from the Vatacan ( Byrne ), learns of this and is summoned to investigate. As her wounds keep appearing, Father Kiernan becomes determined to save her at the risk of losing his faith and also his life. Good special effects in this movie. By NO MEANS can this movie be compared to The Exorcist but there are a couple of disturbing scenes in this movie adding to the suspense. Overall, a good movie that won't keep you bored. Worth renting!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I absolutely loved these movies. The theoretical conceptualization behind the idea of control is brilliantly put forth in these films.  <br /> <br />These movies superbly mimic, in terms of reflection upon the constructs put forth in mans consciousness, the idea that we only conceive what we have been taught until we discover the truth behind the dream that is The Matrix. Finally we see a movie which is bursting with originality and layers of depth which allows the mind to conceive beyond the limitations that is set by society.  <br /> <br />Yuen Wo Ping choreographs the kung fu with elegant grace and powerful style which increases the films integrity.  <br /> <br />In these films we see so many brilliant concepts intertwined in one, love, war, philosophy, authority, control, but what for me stood out the most was that mankind stood together all colors and creeds and were united against a heartless enemy in its prejudice (Machinery that had gained intelligence, which in fact mimics what modern day white men have done to all cultures in terms of breaking them down into one singular conformity, marginalizing diversity to fit in the current societal boundaries.)
B00003CXSP|4.0|Great movie!! Although Hannibal is the 2nd movie released in The Silence Of The Lambs trilogy, it is actually meant to be the final movie. Red Dragon follows Hannibal but Red Dragon is actually the prequel to The Silence Of The Lambs. I rate this movie equally with Red Dragon, 4 stars. Once again, Anthony Hopkins delivers an outstanding and brilliant performance as Lecter. Although Jodie Foster is not in this movie ( wish she would have been ), Julianne Moore does give a good performance as Clarice Starling. It's hard not to compare her to Foster in this movie but it doesn't take away from this wonderful thriller. Great horror and violence in this one! as we see Lecter re-emerge in Italy. But this time, someone else has it in for Lecter and Starling is now on the case, trying to locate Lecter. Alot of violence and blood in this one! It will truly keep you entertained from beginning to end. Very well done! Very well written! and truly delivers as the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs!!! A must see for Lecter fans!!
1881273156|3.0|this book was well written, easy to read and quickly gets to the point.  With Christian fundamentals it's a bit hard to believe any love language is black and white which is sometimes how you feel when reading, but one should always look past the words and stories of others.
6304696515|5.0|Dangerous Liasons is more or less an intrigue movie placed in an historical drama setting. While the intrigue and viciousness of the two main protagonists (played brilliantly by Glenn Close and the effortlessly evil John Malkovitch) seems modern, it does in fact have a basis in historical fact. Not that anything in the movie (or the novel for that matter) actually happened, but 18th century France (and most of Europe, for that matter) was a society much different from our own. The aristocracy, revelling in decandence, controlled all of the wealth, power, and influence. As absolute power corrupts absolutely, the aristocracy thought very little of human life besides their own, privileged lives. In this context, Dangerous Liasons works beautifully as a historical drama as the aristocratic Close & Malkovitch play games with human lives- until the game spirals out of control.     As a period piece, Dangerous Liasons is a beautiful film. The settings, costumes, and cinematography are all splendid, giving the film a truly authentic feel. The script is EXCELLENT, with complicated machinations being attempted by both Close and Malkovitch as each tries to outdo the other. The complex characterizations add a depth to the script that really makes the story compelling to watch.     The true hailing of Dangerous Liasons though, is the ACTING. Both Close and Malkovitch are SUPERB in their roles- Close is the epitome of aristicratic coldness, while Malkovitch's understated approach rings of evil masked beneath a thin veneer.  Michelle Pfeiffer also delivers the goods, as does virtually all of the supporting cast. The one exception, of course, is Keanu \\"Meathead\\" Reeves, who is quite possibly the worst actor to ever acheieve success in the history of Hollywood (his ONLY decent performance: Reeves was quite good in The Matrix). Why the producers would have cast him (at a time that he had yet to achieve superstar status) in a movie full of TRUE thespians is anyones guess, but Reeves is hopelessly out of his league here, and is Dangerous Liasons only blemish. Still, as an ensemble cast, the acting in Dangerous Liasons is absolutely FIRST RATE.     This is a film for anyone who enjoys historical dramas, especially if you can appreciate villainous intrigue. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!
B000301YY8|4.0|Read about James Blunt somewhere and decided to take a chance and see what he sounded like.  Like the sound he produces with his voice and is certainly a throwback to earlier artists.  Best thing about him is the voice itself.  Plus I like the fact that you can understand the words and the songs each have a story to tell.  He is reminiscient of the folk singers of an earlier generation.
0141439513|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC book.  The story, while it has wording that is difficult to follow at first, depicts how our assumptions cause all kinds of mayhem and actually my deter us from our destiny.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book.  I read at night before bed... and there were some nights I stayed up until 4 reading.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Not only does this film was exquisitely made for a different audience by Disney, but they were able to capture the real message implicitly stated in Carrol's book; here, we are able to succumb into the fantastic wonderlands brought upon by psychedelics, and more often than not, one is constantly reminded about the useless games and parodies we set ourselves with on a daily basis. Alice realizes that something has happened, but is not able to handle all this nonsense, which in fact are just a product of her own mind. Most importantly, I believe, is to watch this film under a preferred state of consciousness as to better appreciate the subtle messages the producers wanted to put across, and luckily, by the end of the film, you can ask yourself: Who am I?
0316779237|1.0|Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, \\"aren't I hilarious?\\" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book.  Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book.<br /><br />The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales.  (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely.  So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher.  I'll never know.  Neither should you.)<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters.  They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them.<br /><br />Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too.
0060595183|5.0|An extremely well-written piece by a wonderful novelist. Not only does Huxley is able to convey his mescalin-induced thoughts with pungent pervasiveness, but also sets the wheels of human curiosity into motion, as to make one wonder about the possibility of a parallel world of \\"infinite and divine\\" all around us, readily available at the touch of our fingertips. As a society, we whould be grateful to Huxley's catatonic introspections and mapping of the human psyche.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The Best Pride and Prejudice yet to be produced.  Artists and music lovers this movie is a rare delight.  The cast seemed picked by Jane Austen herself. If you think Colin Firth is synonymous with Mr. Darcy then Matthew Macfadyen will make you re-think your loyaty.  Mr. Macfadyen has captured Jane Austen's Darcy, not hollywood's Darcy.  Keira Knightley eyes are as fine as Lizzie's.  Donald Sutherland's last scene as Mr. Bennet with Lizzie in his study is perhaps one of the most genuine performances that I have had the joy to watch.  I watched it over and over again.  Rosammund Pike is the perfect, most beautiful Jane- just as Jane Austen wrote she's the most beautiful of the sisters. She embodies Jane's purity and innocence, her endearing qualities shine through.  I have not enjoyed a \\"Jane\\" yet -til now.  The use of light and darkness, the constant use of black and white the art and sculptures are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. There is a scene at Pemberley in the art gallery.  The staute of the veiled woman took my breath away!  It was just gorgeous.  The timing in the sunrise scenes are a visual dream! Breathtaking locations, views and beautiful music and acting!  Bravo!!!  And to top it all off--the world famous pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet plays all the piano music.  This presentation of the most beloved love story appeals to us visually, audibly and emmotionally.  Well done!- a must have!
B000059PPN|2.0|As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes. <br /> <br />House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues.  <br /> <br />Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody. <br /> <br />Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse. <br /> <br />Also, this version has a \\"never before seen deleted scene\\", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack.

0783240287|5.0|Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is a must for everyone of all ages. The way it was filmed is spectacular and tells the story in such a wonderful way. The only thing wrong is there is no CD of this. There are other CD's on the market--do not be fooled, they do no justice to Donny Osmond & Maria Freedman's performance. I am 40 and grew up in the era of Osmond's but was never a fan. Donny's portrayal of Joseph has turned me into a die hard fan---this movie has pulled me thru many a bad day, I've owed the tape for 4 years and have 2 copies on DVD because I have seen it at least 75 times ----

B00004T0UT|5.0|Oh yes! Elvis, you're my man. <br />Just take the first twelve, the original list back in 1969, and what you gotta do is bend down your knees while listen this wonderful recreation of all the american musical tradition: country, blues, country sung as a blues and blues sung as country (no one could or can do as he did), soul and almost gospel. <br />Nobody, I say and swear, ever had (neither has) that wonderful ability to take another's song and make it his. From the first roar (\\"I had to return for a little while!\\") to the last chord you'll find yourself weeping, crying, laughing, jumping, and falling absolutely in love with the music, the voice and the man. <br />Here are four bonus tracks, incluiding the best song he ever recorded: Suspicious minds (take a look: the producer was Chips Moman but the whole idea about the arrangements was Elvis'). <br />Just enjoy it. He was so much more than critics say.
0345475674|5.0|Harris really hit the target with this atractive book. He writes well, makes smart use of the many details history knows about those terrifying days in Pompei, put his characters in the middle of all that with cunning and zest and so the result is, simply, that you just cannot leave the reading until the very last page. Very satisfactory book and besides instructive for those of us that did  not know too much details about the catastrophe.
B000002MTU|2.0|Though I like very much Eric Clapton here the only thing he does is to have some fun with his group. There is nothing new, neither the arrangements, and he sings like a frog.

B000002KCC|5.0|few artists have produced as emotionally and musically varied albums as neil young. but burning throughout is his honesty, passion, and raw guitar. call him a primitivist or a genius, no matter. this album has been compared, rightly, to an irish wake and was recorded after the death of a bandmate. filled with hard tales of addiction, good times and deals gone bad. but every bit as important as young's more popular albums.
0307276902|1.0|It would have been a compelling piece of non-fiction but as everyone knows there isn't much that is true in it.  Even Oprah finally figured it out. <br /> <br />Before I had completed it - it seemed a bit far-fetched.  Mr Frey on the verge of death was able to intimidate mafia bosses and tough guys of all sorts.  He was able with his iron will to rescue maidens from crack houses withstanding the temptations.  <br /> <br />So it wasn't a big suprise to read the online article that discovered that anything that could have been documented such as arrest records, didn't exist or the events were dramatically different from Mr. Frey's recollection. <br /> <br />So I'm am unhappy to have added to Mr. Frey's wealth with my purchase.
B000002KIE|5.0|first, for those of you who have no understanding of punk, know that the pistols and other early punk bands were about live performance, not recordings. having said that, given that their career as a band was short-lived, try this album to grok what they were about. <br /> <br />the truth is these songs sound almost innocent compared to the headache rock, death & speedmetal, goth and other punk spinoffs that have sprouted since. musically the songs are simple and great rock n roll. lydon was an acidic, brilliant lyricist, as good as punk ever had, and his raw on-edge \\"singing\\" is as good as any punk vocalist ever.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|\\"Cloud 9\\" contains what is probably one of my all-time favorite songs--the fun pop song \\"Got My Mind Set on You.\\"  It was a standard on the radio and on MTV and VH1 in 1987 (when the two big music networks were still only playing music videos).  The song is just alot of fun--and is accompanied by an equally fun music video.  I agree that Harrison is probably the least appreciated of The Beatles (I can recall a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch in which Harrison was played by Dennis Miller--who barely said anything--definitely living up to the reputation of being \\"The Quiet Beatle\\").<br /><br />I like fun music, and this song lives up to that in a BIG way.  I was five years old when this song hit the airwaves, and I still relish the rare moments that it shows up on the radio, often going as far as singing it at the top of my lungs--the same way I did in 1987.  the video itself is even a rarity--I can recall it being played on VH1 (MTV definitely will never air this video) in November 2001 after his death, and several years earlier, in 1996, during a Beatles tribute weekend.<br /><br />Ok, so I'm rambling about one song on the album, but it is THE song that would convince me to consider purchasing the album.<br /><br />RIP George Harrison--may your legacy live on!
B00009P1O0|5.0|few rock critics will agree but for this listener, on the beach is his best. mired in the lost innocence and despair of the 70s (at least one sing refers specifically to Nixon, another charles manson), the album is musically spare and low-key but so emotionally raw and exposed that it goes right to the emotion-center of the brain.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|To truly enjoy \\"Big Fish\\" depends on how easily you can remember how you saw the world when you were a child. Exaggerated, unreal and totally engrossing we all created fantastic, dream-like stories of who we'd like to be and how the world could be that dominated our lives. Fortunately or unfortunately, most of us have forgotten how to do it, unlike Ed Bloom, a man who is incapable of believing and therefore retelling a story without exaggerating it into a childishly idealistic view of how things were.    And that's what \\"Big Fish\\" is all about - the retelling of Ed's highly entertaining, charming, enthusiastic, at times very funny and, of course, ridiculously unbelievable tales which provide a bizarrely surrealistic canvas that's perfectly suited to Tim Burton's skills in creating \\"fantastic\\" cinematic visualisations.     Or is it? His stories enrich his own life but their telling is a completely self-centred and even self-destructive exercise. On the one hand, they reveal a wonderfully romantic man who only sees the beautiful and exciting things in life and whose memories amplify the \\"good things\\" out of all proportion to reality; on the other, a man who is so wrapped-up in his fantasies that he completely alienates his son who, having once been captivated by his tales, now sees them as repetitively boring and corrosive to his father's relationships. And here's where the real interest of the film lies. Tenderly and carefully explored, their wholly different views of the world and the tensions this causes elevate it from a superb slice of pure entertainment to a thought-provoking and deeply reflective insight into life, culminating in an intensely moving \\"twist\\" in which the son weaves an equally idealistic dream-story of the perfect death for his father, as he's dying, and, in doing so, realises that exaggerating the \\"truth\\" can be a powerful source of joy.        Beautifully constructed and superbly acted the question \\"Big Fish\\" poses is, \\"is it wrong for an adultto exaggerate things in such a childish way?\\" And the answer?... well that's for you to decide, but, if you can suspend disbelief and remember what it was like to fantasise, it will absolutely enthral you.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is an extremely original and thought provoking film.  It's a wild ride through the teenage mind of Donnie Darko.   <br /> <br />Donnie's ride begins when he is visited by a rather large and scary rabbit who predicts the world will end in a matter of days.  The same night his room is obliterated when an airplane engine comes crashing through the roof.  This sets in motion a chain of events that lead the already troubled youth to become obsessed with apocalyptic visions, time travel and the nature of reality. <br /> <br />Is he delusional or a visionary?  What is the nature of reality and time? How do we fit into the universe?  All of these things are part of the sometimes strange, sometimes funny world of the denizens of Darko's universe.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|First of all, this movie doesn't really take any of the storylines from the original Brothers Grimm books.  I had thought that the movie would incorporate more of their fairytales, but it didn't.  Putting this aside, the plot was creative and interesting.  The special effects were decent; nothing that was absolutely astounding like \\"The Matrix\\" for instance.  The performances by the actors were the biggest victory for the movie; I think that everyone did an excellent job.  My biggest gripe is that I'm not sure what audience they were trying to target.  Most adults aren't really going to be too enthusiastic about the subject of the movie.  But I feel that the mood is a little too dark to be appropriate for kids under about 8 or so.  I can honestly imagine little kids having nightmares after watching this.  I think that this movie is worth renting, but not worth buying.
B000068OSK|5.0|This is such an amazing debut by The White Stripes....like all of their other CDs, it might take a few listens to get into it, but you soon recognize the genius and intricacy of every song(except Astro, I always skip that one).

0156027321|2.0|I am an avid reader and when I read the reviews of this book I decided to try it.  Let me just say. BORING BORING BORING.  The first 100 pages were so bland and way too descriptive of things that were not even vital to the story line.  Pages 100-200 were ok. There was a good deal of action and interesting description of surviving the ocean. The last 100 pages, again boring.  All in all, if you want to read this book, skip the first 100 and last 100 pages and you may enjoy it.
0553801503|4.0|The questions raised by critics and reviewers are more and less than accurate.<br />Is this a great, well written Fantasy? Yes, if the next installment justifies the enormous amount of pages used in this story to tell all the side stories that are going on in order (one hopes) to develop the characters in this story. Could this story have been more concise? It's hard to imagine that it couldn't have been, but this is a very different kind of Fantasy, that has a level of depth of motivation and viewpoint unheard of in any story of its kind. All of the many \\"main\\" characters are multi-dimensional, with many shades of grey.  Is this story too ambitious? Maybe, (there is like a 100 page appendix of names of characters to keep track of) but I hope not, only time and the rest of the story will tell.<br />Like the rest of the installments in this saga, this is not a book for kids, and not a book for the prudish. Two more warnings, I hadn't read the previous  installments in over a year, and didn't want to read them over again to refresh my memory, it made for slow reading trying to remember how characters had gotten to where they were in the story, and lastly, most of the more interesting story lines are not in this book, the author explains in the afterward, that he wanted to tell this part first, so... you might want to wait and read it all in a row, but I didn't want to, and I'm glad I didn't.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|(2 1/2 stars) <br />Sam Mendes has always been able to bring viewers insightful and entertaining material, but in Jarhead, he delivers a absolutely mediocre adaptation of the Swofford novel that feels so much like Full Metal Jacket than anything else.  I think Mendes should have payed attention to how Kubrick adapted the novel for his film.  The movie begins promisingly, but just keeps on reminding us of how close it is to Full Metal Jacket, with the hard drill instructor, the complete idiots in the corps, and the character stuck in the middle of it all.  Gyllenhaal does what he can with the script and I think he does a pretty good job of playing his part.  Most of the other characters are wholly forgettable, and even their stupid nicknames serves as another drawing point to Full Metal Jacket.  Peter Saarsgard, who is in every movie ever made these days, is also forgettable, but not as much as the other mediocre characters.  I would have liked to see more of Chris Cooper in this film, because having Cooper as a supporting actor automatically adds a better quality to a movie.  Cooper may be the best supporting actor of all time (see also: October Sky, Adaptation, Syriana).  Jamie Foxx seems to be drifting towards that category of actors who lost their career after winning an Academy Award (see also Cuba Gooding Jr.), but we'll have to see what his next project or two adds up to before we go jumping to conclusions.  There really is only one scene where he stands out (it's the one everyone saw in the trailer).  All in all, it isn't the worst war movie, but it definitely will be forgotten over time and won't ever reach the ranks of Full Metal Jacket or Platoon.
006056251X|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed this installment of Kleypas' Wallflower series.   <br /> <br />The story of Evie and Sebastian were so beautifully and deliciously drawn out, the interaction between the two individuals were hilarious at times, tender in others and generally simmering in the surface.

B000E1ZBH2|1.0|I was greatly spoiled by the previous 1995 BBC mini series of this movie.. and although I expected this latest version to be good based on all the hype it received.. I must say, I was sorely disappointed in it.  It in NO manner can compare with the BBC's version. Although normally I am a fan of Keira Knightly, in my opinion, she truly lacked in her portrayal of Austin's Elizabeth Bennet.  Similarly, Matthew Macfadyen is just NO Colin Firth, who plays Darcy as no other.  For anyone that has not yet seen this movie, perhaps this version would suffice.. but my advise is to buy the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995. I think it far superior.
0553062182|4.0|I would have to agree with another reviewer that this book did not address for me how to deal with emotional sensitivity.  That is, how can I be in the world but not take on the world.  Having said that I do give an enormous credit to the power of awareness that developed in me from reading this book.  I had many, many \\"ah-haa's\\" and identifications while reading it.  This book helped me greatly to know and understand myself in a way I never did before reading it, and because of that awareness, I am able to identify situations now where I am being overloaded.  The question is, how to deal with the overload once I see it.  I have found this book to be a remarkable catalyst in that regard.  I turned towards several other books on the energy system including the works of Barbara Brennan.  I saw her writings in a new view, especially the Schizoid character defense she describes in her book Light Emerging.  I have found many practical ways of dealing with emotional overload by looking at it from an energetic viewpoint, but these I found in other resources such as Barbara Brennan and EFT tapping techniques ([...]  Overall I highly recommend this book to all, but suggest that further resourcing is needed.  Take the ball and roll, and try anything you can.  I think we all just want to be happy and productive in the world, and this book is a fantastic starting point.

The instructions are easy to follow & many of the recipes can be made by them alone (with me close by, of course.)  By doing it on their own & with Star Wars as the theme, they tried things they wouldn't have before & they loved it!!  There has only been one thing they haven't liked  (Mos Eisley Morsels--they were very dry), but the Bossk Brownies, Wookie Cookies & Greedo Burrito were the best to them. It was definately worth the money!!!  We have only had it a few weeks & we've tried most of it & keep going back!!  Can't say enough good about it!!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Gorillaz has a little bit of everything on their CDs. Most of it is very different from conventional rock (or rap, they have both in Demon Days) and I'll admit I had to listen through the whole CD about three times to form an oppinion about it. A lot of the songs didn't really amaze me the first time I heard them but they grew on me and now I can listen through most of Demon Days without having to skip a track.     Track List   Intro- 4/5: Four out of five stars for an intro anyway... I'm just not too big on intros as it is. I see them as unnecessary, but this one is actually ok. A spooky melody with some harp-strumming like noises in the background and an ending of a voice saying \\"You are now entering the harmonic world...\\" and he's darn right.    Last Living Souls- 4/5: Kicking off the CD is a song that has a great bass and up-front beat. It starts off as just this but once the main melody kicks in it doesn't let up at all.    Kids With Guns- 4/5: \\"Kids with guns. Kids with guns. Taking over. It won't be long.\\" This song has more lyric diversity than most of the songs in Demon Days (some of them just repeat the same thing over and over and let the great tunes handle the rest). And, of course, the music itself is wonderful (I particularly like the wierd slowdown noise at the beginning each chorus)    O Green World- 4/5: Yes, another 4, but it shows the consistency of Gorillaz. O Green World has nice guitar work and tons of little bibs, beeps, boops and whoops throughout. \\"O green world... don't desert me now...\\"    Dirty Harry- 5/5: Now the rollercoaster begins, which also means that the consistency of almost-perfect songs ends. Hit... miss... hit... miss... Anyway, Dirty Harry starts out with a killer beat and a tune that I won't ever be able to get out of my head. Children sing much of this song along with the perfect melody holding it's ground throughout the song untill the end, where a short bit of violin playing seperates the rock from the Beastie Boys style rap.    Feel Good INC.- 5/5: Is this that song I keep hearing on the radio? Yes it is, and now you can listen to it until you feel like poking your eardrums out with a pencil! Feel Good INC. makes you... feel good. With a strange, noise filled tune that makes you feel like you're floating around in whatever you consider a perfect world in-between each chorus, perfect guitar melodies, fast paced hip-hop style singing ending each chorus, and the way that guy laughs always makes a grin creep across my face. Feel Good INC. is hands down the best song on this CD.    El Manana- 2/5: Ew. This song is just plain boring, which is not what I have come to expect from Gorillaz. Just another slow paced, dull lullaby.    Every Planet We Reach Is Dead- 3/5: Meh. Not much... a very slow paced song, but a nice melody keeps me from skipping it most of the time.    November Has Come- 4/5: Mostly rap with smooth, \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" stlye background melody. Good song all around.    All Alone- 4/5: The first 45 seconds of this song are just saying \\"all alone\\" over and over to a funkey buzzing sound. Then it throws you into rap that lasts untill a womans voice comes up somewhere in the middle of it all and sings to a smooth, difting, space-like tune and then you get back to the \\"all alone\\" part that closes the song.    White Light- 3/5: I might like this song better if there were any lyrics in it... White Light is very deceiving. Almost the whole song sounds like it's warming up to heavy metal, but never quite gets there. Just a nice beat with whispers of \\"White light... White light... White Light... Alchohol, alchohol, alchohol...\\" Yep. Thats it. Suddenly, it cuts off into a dreamy melody, this makes you think that there will be some soft singing coming along, but it just jumps back to \\"White Light... dadadada, White Light...\\" and then it ends.    Dare- 5/5: No slackers here; Dare barely gives you a chance to grab on before it takes off. It sounds a lot like an 80's disco/dance song. It's also a fairly long song. At one point in the middle, they reach the end of yet another chorus and stop singin for a few seconds, leading you to think that the song had ended. Suddenly the song picks up again (I thought my CD player was skipping the first time I heard this part) and does one more chorus along with a different finish. Fast paced, perkey tune, clear lyrics, great song.    Fire Coming Out of The Monkey's Head- 5/5: Why yes, this is one of my favorate... stories. It is about a people known as the happy folk, living in peace with the spirit of the great mountian known as The Monkey. Living in peace... untill the strange folk arrived... Odd, but one of my favorate songs anyway. The story is spoken, not sung, against a solid, heavy beat with cool humming at the end of each chorus. \\"Why was the monkey bringing darkness into their lives?\\"    Don't Get Lost In Heaven- 2/5: Sounds like some kind of 60's love song or something. A piano playing the same notes through the whole thing along with... lyrics. More boring music.    Demon Days- 2/5 A boring end to an overall excellent CD. Sounds like Don't Get Lost in Heaven in many ways... soul choir singing out the end, whooing... Yippee...    Overall- 5/5: Demon Days has some boring songs in it of course, but doesn't every CD (although if you like smooth, slow songs, I guess those parts are good for you)? Wierd songs overall, but far more brilliant then any other conventional rock CD in my eyes, although it might be a little too wierd for people who are afraid to leave their little one-kind-of-music-forever comfort zone. If you're looking for a change of pace, already like music like this, or just have any wierd in your blood that you're willing to bring forth and give Gorillaz a chance, buy this CD!
0553801503|1.0|It's as if George R.R. Martin had an intern write this book for him. <br /> <br />I absolutely hate this installement!  I am so totally dissapointed.  This is only magnified by my love of the first three books, which I consider masterpieces.  If all the characters in this book collectively walked off a cliff, never to be heard from again, I would be happy.  And if the author follows this up with something equally mediocre then he can do the same thing (along with George Lucas).

B00005MP58|5.0|The best!  After watching the movie, I read Pride and Prejudice.  The filmmakers followed the storyline very closely. It was easy to imagine the actors in the roles as I read.  Made it that much more enjoyable to read.  A must see for Jane Austen fans.
B000BOH8XW|2.0|At first I thought this album was terrible! Laundry Service is one of the best albums that has been released and even though \\"Oral Fixation vol. 2\\" doesn't even come close to it, it is still a decent album once you give it ago.... <br />         <br />1. How Do You Do - The best track on the album by far....the song questions God's way...And in many ways the song is correct, some people may find it offensive because they do not believe that God is to blame for all bad things that happen in life...8/10 <br />2. Don't Bother - The debut single, I would say it was a weak choice, the song is catchy but didn't get Shakira anywhere 5/10    <br />3. Illegal (featuring Carlos Santana) - \\"It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart\\" is a line from this track, the lyrics are neat but its missing that something....5/10  <br />4. The Day and the Time - Shakira sings about a love that may still be able to be reborn....it's a nice track, as always the lyrics are great 5/10  <br />5. Animal City - The next single from the album, this was the first track that caught my attention. The lyrics can be a bit werid at sometimes but its a great up-tempo track 6/10 <br />6. Dreams for Plans - Shakira sings about a time when her love was pure and true and now that its all settled down and their dreams have become more of plans 5/10 <br />7. Hey You - I dont really like this track. Shakira sounds a bit too confident here...and its missing attitude, sounds more slutty 3/10 <br />8. Your Embrace - This track is sung from the heart, kinda sounds a bit country....4/10 <br />9. Costume Makes the Clown - One of the better tracks. It more rock, reminds me of \\"Objection\\", its still missing something though, but its a good track 6/10 <br />10. Something - Shakira sings of a strong love.....5/10 <br />11. Timor - The 2nd best track. The song is about people living in East Timor that people all seem to forget about....7/10 <br /> <br />Overall the album is OK....Shakira fans will find something that pleases them other people wont! <br /> <br />
B0007GAEGC|4.0|A friend turned me onto Celtic Woman, and I'm glad she did. I really haven't listened to this type of music before. I used to break out a classical cd when I wanted to relax with something different, but for now, when I'm not in the mood for some good old classics, rock 'n roll, or anything else that i usually listen to, it's going to be this one. I'm glad I was opened-minded enough to try it. You should too.  :)

B00079018K|4.0|It's a long review, but serves the context...<br /><br />There was the revolution led in the late eighties by Ministry & Nine Inch Nails; they dragged industrial rock screaming into the mainstream. Their pioneer melding of Punk, Heavy Metal & electronic music enabled the follow-up successes of Garbage, White Zombie, Rammstein and Marilyn Manson.<br /><br />Across the sea, the UK was held in thrall by underground raves & the 'love pill', ecstasy. It couldn't last. By the early nineties, the rave scene was being clamped out. The laws were getting harsher, drug lords were taking over the ecstasy distribution and original 'rave' artists like the Chemical Brothers, Prodigy and Orbital were branching out on different styles of music, including Rock.<br /><br />The common ground both scenes shared soon led to multiple \\"collaborations\\" on movie soundtracks, including 'Spawn' (1997), 'The Matrix' (1999) & 'Tomb Raider' (2001).<br /><br />But that's history. That was electronic rock back then.<br /><br />Now comes Kasabian, lending a \\"fresh\\" spin to the genre. If the nineties was the decade of the future, 2000 is the decade of the past. Kasabian are all about moogs, 'space age' theremins, occasional hip-hop beats (DJ Shadow & Blacklicious are cited as influences) and hypnotic kraut riffing. In more than one way, they are unique and, weirdly enough, more futuristic than anything out there.<br /><br />Also, you can't compare this with industrial rock. The former is brash, agressive, in-your-face. Kasabian is a far more psychedelic, chilled out and somewhat jagged listening. Their self-titled debut is full of false starts (a la Tricky; hear \\"Processed Beats\\" intro), weird sonic details in the song's background (\\"L. S. F\\") and drug culture references (\\"Cut Off\\").<br /><br />Recomended!
0761536434|2.0|Less misleadingly titled, Kent's book would perhaps be known as \\"A rough chronology of the marketing of video game machines by major companies operating in the United States, with some asides on game marketing companies, padded with interesting gossip and presented with generous margins.\\" <br /> <br />That's not a snappy title, but it's pretty much what you get in this book. It is a \\"history\\" only in the sense that it concerns a roughly chronologic list of events impinging on companies involved in one consumer-goods section of the U.S. commercial economy. Relevance to any larger insights about the game-machine industry seems to have been a minor consideration; \\"juiciness\\" seems to have been the principal criterion for this book. A case in point is a drawn out tale of S. Jobs misleading his Apple partner about payment received for video-game related work: however, this incident seems to have impacted the history of Apple, not any company (or person) primarily involved in the video game industry. Indeed, it is not clear at all why Jobs is mentioned so often in this book, save that he later became famous for other reasons. <br /> <br />What you get here is much less than it seems: as mentioned in other reviews here, the scores upon scores of extended quotations serve to make the book much longer (not to mention heavier) than it need be without illuminating any of the points made in the main text. <br /> <br />What you don't get here is what would make a history of video games per se interesting. Among the missing: <br />1. The question of why people play video games <br />2. Why people choose one game over another <br />3. The history of video game play (as opposed to marketing) <br />4. Information on fan groups or other actual players of games <br />5. Any research beyond interviews and promotional literature reviews <br /> <br />On a positive note, as a 47-year-old, I did enjoy being reminded of games I saw 25 years ago while strolling through arcades. Not recommended, even if you receive the book as a gift. <br />

B00079FUI6|5.0|I have to admit that at first I didn't jump on the \\"Desperate Housewives\\" bandwagon like most people did when the show first premiered on ABC in the fall of 2004. Then I caught the pilot episode when it aired as a rerun. Afterwards, I could see what all the fuss was about. I really enjoyed the first episode of this show, but about ten episodes had already aired by the time I saw the pilot, and this is the kind of show that you need to watch from the first episode to the last episode in the order that they air. So therefore I had to wait until the show made its debut on DVD, and then I was able to watch every episode from beginning to end.     \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is a sometimes funny, sometimes serious show that deals with sex, murder, blackmail, and plenty of dirty laundry. The show takes place on Wisteria Lane, and centers mostly around five totally different women: Susan Mayer, Lynette Scavo, Bree Van De Kamp, Gabrielle Solis, and Edie Britt. These five characters are brought wonderfully to life by Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, and Nicollette Sheridan. While these five women are the anchor of \\"Desperate Housewives\\", they are surrounded by alot of memorable supporting characters. The action on Wisteria Lane begins with the suicide of Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong, who does an excellent narrating job), who was close friends with Susan, Lynette, Bree, and Gabrielle. While \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is part comedy and part drama, it also contains some mystery that's thrown in for good measure. The main mystery of the first season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is that these ladies try to figure out why their dear friend decided to kill herself. In the middle of all this you get plenty of lust, intrigue, and messy situations that all play out in terrific fashion. Besides the big mystery storyline, some of the other memorable major storylines in season one include: Susan's relationship with new neighbor Mike (James Denton); Gabrielle's affair with her 17-year-old gardener John (Jesse Metcalfe) that she desperately tries to keep a secret from her husband Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira); Lynette's adventures as a stay-at-home mom in which most of the time she has to deal with her kids more than her husband Tom (Doug Savant); and Bree driving her husband Rex (Steven Culp) and two teenage kids Andrew and Danielle (Shawn Pyfrom and Joy Lauren) crazy with her constant perfectionist attitude.      The acting, writing, and directing of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is all first rate. The show's creator is Marc Cherry, who started off as a writer of episodes of my personal favorite show \\"The Golden Girls\\". That's interesting, because \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is probably the best television series since \\"The Golden Girls\\" to feature an entire female cast in the leading roles. All of their hard work has earned the cast and crew plenty of awards. \\"Desperate Housewives\\" won 2 Golden Globes for its first season: Best Comedy Series, and Best Actress in a Comedy Series for Teri Hatcher. It followed that with 2 Screen Actors Guild awards, with Hatcher winning again for Best Actress in a Comedy Series, and Best Ensemble Cast of a Comedy Series. At the Emmy awards, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" got stumped a little. In spite of 15 Emmy nominations, it failed to win Best Comedy Series. But in a surprise twist in the Best Actress in a Comedy Series category, Felicity Huffman took home the Emmy in this category, beating out co-stars Hatcher and Cross (Hatcher was the heavy favorite to win).     After watching all these episodes of the first season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\", I'm now a big fan of the show. And I've watched every episode of season two so far. And yes, I'll get the second season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" when it comes out on DVD.    This is a great show.
B000002JSN|5.0|\\"Kashmir\\" and \\"Ten Years Gone\\" are amazing classics that I'll always love. What's always blown me away about Led Zeppelin is their range - both musical and lyrical. They jam and then a ballad can bring tears to your eyes, there's so much depth in their music. If you don't have this CD - you really will love it! I've been loving it for many, many years - since it first came out - and it NEVER gets old! It's awesome!
B000C65Z1G|3.0|There are times when a film exists purley to make a political statement, and this one is a case in point: Pharmaceutical companies play god with those who cannot defend themselves and live lavishly on the profits of their immoral exploits. Extraordinarily simplistic, to be very kind. I found this heavy-handed attempt at manipulation both annoying and a selfishly transparent attempt at exploiting what might otherwise have been a great film. The acting was superb, but the plot was uneven and the conclusion unsatisfying. Both main characters were polar opposites, which set up an implausible relationship from the outset, and I never felt a connection to either one of them.      He was far too weak and she far too strong, leaving him seeming somewhat pathetic and she an insufferable bit-h. The reality was something the likes of which i've never experienced on this particular planet...and I've seen a lot.
0446677450|4.0|Easy to read, Rich Dad, Poor Dad gives great advice into how you should view careers and making money. He's got some solid concepts, and some well written personal experiences to instill his ideologies. Alot of what he said in this book I had thought, but reading it from someone who has been successful in practice helps to give validity to the concepts I already knew. At hte same time he brushes over some methodology giving new directions to branch off in search of financial freedom. That being said, positives and negatives... <br /> <br />Positives: <br />Well written, easy to read, helps to de-program yourself from the \\"career\\" oriented mind set (work to make others rich).  <br /> <br />Negatives: <br />There is more ideology, and less practicle applications.  <br /> <br />Summary: <br />I learned alot from this book (concept wise), though I've had people claim his concepts are immoral. Though they could not state why. These are usually those people who beleive the rich should pay for the poor (Robin Hood worship). I haven't read any of his other books, but I'm hoping this is simply the introduction to a new way of looking at things. So far it's pushed me to investopedia.com and buy some more specific books on the topics he mentions. <br /> <br />I would consider this an introduction to accepting the rich thinker's mentality - don't expect to get rich solely on the advice in this book, but you can definetly break the cycle of the poor thinker.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I ended the year 2005 reading \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" for the first time, and I completely loved the novel. While I was reading it, I was waiting to see when the movie would come to a nearby theater. Much to my disappointment, it did not come, though it was promised to appear.<br /><br />So instead, as I finished the novel, I preordered  the movie from Amazon.com, since I anticipated truly enjoying this film.<br /><br />I loved it. Having just read the book, it felt like walking into the novel itself and seeing the characters come to life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for all Jane Austen fans!

0671027344|5.0|This book is very touching-you get so wrapped around the life of Charlie, your normal teenage wallflower.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down for a second.<br /><br />Charlie's letters are more personal and intimate than any diary, and they are-to me-more affective at touching you. Written to an anonymous person, his letters disclose every haunting detail of his life.<br /><br />The end-unlike most books-left me very satisfied. I felt as though I was complete, and that I too-like Charlie-was 'infinite'.<br /><br />You will laugh. You will cry. And all in a matter of moments.<br /><br />It's a great read. Period.

6304286961|1.0|The film is terrible and incorrect from the opening credits to the end or when you press the stop button, which ever comes soonest. There is error after error after error on this film. Oilver Stone ammitted to telling some small lies to expand on bigger truths however he never even started telling the truths. Whatever a director could get wrong he got wrong,Morrison's character, names, dates, events and sequencing. Many so called events never even took place, the burning wardrobe and the turkey dinner for example - pure fiction. You like The Doors or Jim Morrison or you want to learn more about them stay away from this product and look for something else. This product is nothing more than insulting to The Doors and Jim Morrison and the one star option was the lowest rating I could give, personally the one star is being generous.
B00005J6UP|5.0|There is not much one can say about the Goonies that thousand others wouldn't already know. The DVD has extra footage and the Goonies music video (in it's entirety, part 1 and part 2). This is one of the all time greatest family films. <br /> <br />There aren't many other films like this - I'd like to say it's an Indiana Jones for kids, but it's not. It doesn't dumb any thing up and even has some adult style humor (but nothing to shy kids away from).  <br /> <br />Full of one liners and quotes I still use to this day, \\"This one, this one right here - this was my dream, my wish, and it didn't come true, so I'm taking it back. I'm taking them all back.\\"
B00005MP58|5.0|On of the most favourite movie. If you are a romantic person you must see this film.
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel Washington (as furious as I am about the oscar loss to Crowe) deserved all the attention he recieved because of this POWERHOUSE of a film.  Although, I must point out that the acting was not the only thing this film had going for it.  The plot was spot on, the dialog was tight and Fuqua did such a kick@$$ job directing...he deserved an oscar nod there!  The film follows Alonzo Harris (Washington) as he trains rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke in his BEST performance ever).  The problem is that Alonzo's methods, while effective in their own ways, are not ethical to say the least, and throughout the 24 hour period Jake is subjected to too much, way too much.  One may start to question Alonzo's motives, and rightfully so.  As the film starts to boil down we see Alonzo's true charactor, his inner demons.  This is by far Washingtons best performance, a true gritty and real performance that left me jaw dropped...although he lacked the perfection that Crowe brought to the table with 'A Beautiful Mind'...alas...There are two scenes that prove Washington deserved his nod...his opening scene in the dinner was the best intro of any charactor in so long, it was spot on perfection.  And the scene in the car where he puts the gun to Jake's head and forces him to smoke the weed...he embodies his charactor, mind body and soul.  This is one of the most origional pieces of hollywood history I've ever scene and is well worth the 2 hours spent in front of the screen, thanks to a tightly woven plot, breathtaking direction, perfect dialog and yes, Washington!
B000AMJDHY|3.0|Im really not too sure why I got this CD. I bought it without hearing any of their songs or knowing anything about them. Ive given the CD about 5 listens now and it just is not my style. Yes, Ill admit some of the songs are catchy and stick in your head but it is just a bit too poppy for me. Also I dont like the lyrics or in particularly the singers voice. THis band wanted to do something different by combining teen pop rock melodies along with dance beats and some other random instruments, but Im not liking it. I recommend this CD for teenage girls who like Fallout Boy.
B000002U82|5.0|God, I love this album (CD) and have since it first came out. This classic never gets old. The instrumentals and vocals are awesome. I have to pay tribute to the songs I've been listening to still after all these years (decades, really) and this is one classic CD that I'll always treasure! If you don't have it, you've gotta get it, because you'll LOVE IT!
B000BCE918|5.0|If you're a movie collecter, meaning you have to have the entire set of movies, then this is a great purchase. For only $18.00 you get three movies. Can't beat that deal. Granted they each don't have their own case, but who needs that, it comes with a cool fold out case. I am enjoying this purchase and will continue to do so.

B000001Y2U|4.0|Every so often, a person who challenges the foundations we have built our lives upon strolls into the spotlight.  One of these characters is Marilyn Manson.  The album Antichrist Superstar is not only gritty pulse-pounding metal, but it is an album made to show society a reflection of themselves.  Okay, first of all, I'm sick of all these people writing reviews and commenting on Manson's life and perspective, which happen to be totally wrong.  Go read \\"The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell\\", his autobiography.  It is an amazing book which will put these ignorant rumors to rest.  Second of all, if you are pissed off because Manson is a Satanist or because his music is about torture, drugs, and transformation, you are obviously blind to the society you are living in. Manson has amazing philisophical and religious perspective and everybody should respect and appreciate that instead of slamming him for rumors such as he removed his ribs to perform oral sex on himself.  Even if you dislike the music, buy this album as brain food.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|We own and seen the original short version of this movie and we love it, when the extended version came out we just had to have it,if you like the original you will love this extended version, but remember \\"extended\\" is the word.
B000002J09|5.0|OMG, did I just write 30 years? Well, it's true! I've been listening and loving this album, 8-Track, now CD since the 70's in high school, and I've never gotten tired of this song, or this CD.<br /><br />This is such a classic. If you want to \\"Get the Led Out\\" this is the CD to buy! Totally AWESOME!
0517543052|5.0|The last word of the last line opens a too brief glimpse of life. Amazing revelation of the possibilities of creative writing.
B000006045|5.0|Every track here is great! The vocals are wonderful. The whole CD is jumpin' with musical ideas, and it feels fresh and full of energy. If you've heard 'Blue Lines' or 'Protection' and you liked them, I guarantee this one will blow you away. Year after year of the same music, artists copying one another, some artists try changing their taste for music. But there's one group that outstands them all. This is Massive Attack's essential work. It is one of the greatest midnight to early hour chill-out album ever created, an amazing blend of hip hop, rock, r&b, reggae, and soul seem to combine into one completely mind-blowing masterpiece. Massive Attack is one of the best bands of this genre, along with \\"Tricky\\", \\"zero 7\\", \\"Spicehouse\\" and \\"Morcheeba\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We greatly enjoyed this series!  After seeing the movie in the theatre, my husband and I decided to check out the series on DVD.  This is top-rate entertainment, and as far as we are concerned, this should never have been cancelled.  We pray for the day that this series is brought back or a sequel to the movie made.  Till then we will watch our Serenity movie and Firefly series DVD over and over.  Fabulous!!!!!
B000E6FSPW|2.0|When I first heard that Rocky IV was being re-issued, I was excited because I really felt a little cheated with the original release.  As great as the songs were, it was still missing a few songs/musical cues.  I was REALLY hoping that this re-release would actually be an expanded version of the previous release... It was \\"expanded\\", but not what I was hoping for.  The ONLY difference between the two versions (besides being remastered) was the inclusion of \\"Man Against The World\\" by Surivor.  This song was supposed to be in the film, but was cut at the last minute.  So now we have TWO songs that were not in the movie on the soundtrack (the other is \\"The Sweetest Victory\\" by Touch, also on the original release).  I was hoping to get the full-length version of \\"Hearts On Fire\\".  The part of the song where Rocky climbs the mountain was ommited from the orignal soundtrack.  The full version should have been included on this release.  We were also subjected to inferior versions of \\"Training Montage\\" and \\"War\\".  Why couldn't they just include the (superior) movie versions instead?  This re-issue would have been the perfect opportunity.  I also wanted to hear more of Vince DiCola's score.  I know that one of the 45's (on vinyl) from the album had \\"Apollo's Death\\" as a b-side.  That should've been on here as well.  When Legacy re-released \\"Footloose\\" and \\"Top Gun\\" they got it right (mostly), but they dropped the ball on this one.  I am so disappointed.
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson-Dangerous <br /> <br />What can you say about Michael Jackson? Well, in one word: GENIUS. Before 1991, when Dangerous was released, Michael released 3 top selling albums that revolutionized the music scene. However, Dangerous is easily the best Michael Jackson album, if not the best album from any artist of all time.  <br /> <br />There are mixed views regarding the hype of Dangerous. Some say it's over hyped, some say it's underrated. Well, selling 31 million copies definitely proves it's not underrated. Over hyped? Well, if so, it was for a good reason. Here is a track by track review of this incredible album: <br /> <br />Jam-Great opening track that introduces and slightly uses hip hop effects. The lyrics are well constructed. Jackson uses collaborators such as rap artists who rap a verse or two within these songs. This was innovative, as many of his peers distanced themselves from rap artists around this time. The video is great, and classic. However, the track does tend to become too long. 9/10 <br /> <br />Why You Wanna Trip on Me-The song opens with a great, unforgettable guitar riff that lasts nearly a minute. Though the lyrics convey a great, strong message, they can come across as...corny. However, the listener doesn't get hung up w/ that aspect. The incredible, catchy chorus leaves the listener wanting more. 9/10 <br /> <br />In The Closet-Underrated single among the general public; it's known to be one of the favorite singles among Jackson's HUGE fan base, though. The Princess of Monaco lends her vocals (she merely talks). However, it proves that Jackson has chemistry w/ sexy women! The lyrics are quite risqu and provocative. `Because if it's aching, you have to rub it'. 10/10 <br /> <br />She Drives Me Wild-Many view this song as mere filler. The song is short, yet sweet. She Drives Me Wild, however, sounds like an 80's reject song from the album `BAD'. 7/10 <br /> <br />Remember The Time-One of the best, if not the best R&B songs of Jackson's ENTIRE career! Throughout time, listeners of all ages would/will agree that the song still sounds fresh, new and modern. One of my personal favorites. The ad libs are amazing as well. 10/10 <br /> <br />Can't Let Her Get Away-This song came across as filler. The vocals are kind of irritating. Michael should have left it off of this album. The beat however, is great. 6/10 <br /> <br />Heal The World-A trademark, MJ song about the classic message and theme of `making the world a better place.' The arrangement of the song is flawless; the choir is introduced at the perfect time, and Jackson's vocals are great. 9/10 <br /> <br />Black or White-The first #1 single from this album. Believe it or not, this song has a legacy. Though Macaulay Culkin's introduction gets tiring, the song is so upbeat, and you never fail to sing along. 10/10 <br /> <br />Who Is It-Ok. This is probably one of the best songs from MJ's career. This is the standout track of the album. Though the song is nearly 6 minutes, it's so good that it seems only 3 minutes. The lyrics tell a story of a prostitute who left Jackson for other people. True R&B song that is flawless. Best track on the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />Give In To Me- When I first heard this song, I was surprised to know this was Michael Jackson. This is as close to Jackson having a hard rock song. The vocals are amazing, and remind you of the likes of Aerosmith, or heavy metal artists. Truly amazing. 10/10 <br /> <br />Will You Be There-Second best track on this album. It's very inspirational. Though the beginning choir/opera did seem to drag on, it only added to the beauty of the song. Again, many, many people know this song. (Hint: Free Willy Soundtrack) 10/10 <br /> <br />Keep The Faith-This song has a gospel feel, with a motivating message. It's a great song. However, it does seem to go on too long. 8/10 <br /> <br />Gone Too Soon-Though the song was intended for a good, worthy purpose: Ryan White's death of AIDS, it's a songthat I skip a lot. The song is sweet, yet it reads more like a poem. Vocals are entirely within the falsetto range. 8/10 <br /> <br />Dangerous-This is a great, funky dance song. Michael talks throughout the song, and again, it reads like a poem. It's great nevertheless. 7/10 <br /> <br />If you do not have any Jackson albums, then here is the order in which you should buy the main releases: <br /> <br />Michael Jackson Number Ones and/or `The Ultimate Collection' <br />Dangerous <br />Bad <br />Off The Wall <br />Thriller <br />HIStory, Past Present and Future Book 1 <br />HIStory Volume 1 <br />Invincible <br />Blood on the Dancefloor HIStory In The Mix <br />The Essential Michael Jackson <br /> <br />
0975991477|3.0|I enjoyed reading Bruce Lipton's \\"The Biology of Belief,\\" because it has a lot of thought-provoking and useful information about how belief affects our cells. However, I had a had time wading through the almost constant first-person narrative Dr. Lipton uses to describe each insight, idea, or moment of understanding he has experienced. The book is too focused on the author's personal journey; while I'm happy that Lipton came to his insights and experienced life change, the reason for reading the book is that I want to apply what the author has learned, to change my own life.  The inspiration of Lipton's narrative should have served the information he offers to the reader, rather than being a distraction.<br /><br />The message of the book, once you get past what seems to be a large ego, is really important and valid for readers. What we believe, the attitudes and expectations, and most of all, the environment we create in our lives, truly impacts our health and the patterns that we live by.  This principle applies to one's physical health, mental and emotional states, and spiritual health.  Joy, wisdom, and even prosperity are influenced by what we believe. So is the liver, the lungs, and the very genetic codes embedded in our cells.<br /><br />I value what Bruce Lipton has written, but would have appreciated the work much more if he had spent less time setting up each concept with long narratives about what he was doing when the \\"revelation\\" came to him.  In any book, the reader wants to be the ultimate subject, but in this book, the author is front and center.
0307276902|5.0|An outstanding, well written book and I think that says it all..5 stars*****!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  A \\"must see.\\"  Be prepared to laugh and to cry.  If you have a chance, watch the complete firefly serioes before watching this movie, but the movie survives well on it's own (my friend, who never watched Firefly loved it too and has since borrowed my Firefly collection).
B000BO0LLS|4.0|Mariah Carey-The Emancipation of Mimi <br /> <br />After recovering from an exhausting year in 2001, and persisting through harsh, almost unnecessary negative criticism of 2002's Charmbracelet, The Queen of Pop returns.  <br /> <br />Initially, when I purchased the original Mimi album on the first day of it's release, I asked myself, `What is all this hype about?!' It takes a while to realize that this album is a solid improvement from almost every album since 1999's `Rainbow.' Each song is delightful, as this album contains very little `filler' if no filler at all.  <br /> <br />Here is a review for each song: <br /> <br />It's Like That-First single from The Emancipation of Mimi album. Though it wasn't a track that officially put Mariah Carey on the charts, it did help put the album itself at #1 in its first week with over 400,000 copies sold. This is a solid, 3:25 minute track. Jermaine Dupri and Fat Man Scoop are collaborators. The vocals are strong and solid. `It's Like That' firmly represents Mariah's individualism and process of emancipating. 9/10 <br /> <br />We Belong Together-The signature song of Mariah Carey's career of the new millennium, as well as 2005's most successful record. Though it didn't' win the Grammy for record of the year, it did win a Grammy under the R&B categories. This is a great ballad that sadly, was overplayed. This is not the `best' song on this album. However, her vocals throughout the entire song remind fans that the real Mariah Carey is back. 9/10 <br /> <br />Shake It Off-The most exciting, upbeat single from this album. Mariah puts her voice to the test, and uses it for songs she doesn't normally produce or sing. `Shake it Off' contains lyrics that are very well written, and composed. The video is great as well. 9/10 <br /> <br />Mine Again-This track reminds us of old Mariah (Debut album-Daydream). However, it seems she tries too hard to show us she has not strained her vocals. There is no rest in the song, as the whole song is basically one note itself. 7/10 <br /> <br />Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg-Retro-70's song produced by Pharrell Williams! Though it might not make a strong single, it is very fun, and funky. The vocals are nice and soft, and Mariah finally realizes she doesn't have to burst a note to make a song great quality. Snoop's rap is unforgettable. 8/10 <br /> <br />Stay The Night-This just might be the BEST song Mariah has recorded since 1997's `Breakdown'. It's disappointing that Mariah looked over this song as a potential single. This just could have been Mariah's 18th #1 single. Why is it so great? Well, having Kanye produce this track can be one reason why. 10/10 <br /> <br />Get Your Number-The track is fun, and funky. However, it's easily forgettable and kind of...irritating?! 7/10 <br /> <br />One and Only featuring Twista-Mariah sings like she has never done before. She is almost...rapping in a low key tone. The song is great, depressing, and never tiring. It could have been a potential single as well. 9/10 <br /> <br />Circles-A classic Mariah ballad. Period. 8/10 <br /> <br />Your Girl-A short, sweet song that introduces the effect of having a powerful choir in an upbeat song. Again, classic Mariah. Sadly, it's too short. 10/10 <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew-Great, typical ballad, but easily forgettable. 7/10 <br /> <br />To The Floor featuring Nelly-Many people skip over this track, as it is lackluster, and Nelly doesn't help w/ his whiny, irritating vocals. 6/10 <br /> <br />Joy Ride-One of the best R&B songs since 2002's `Bringing On The Heartbreak'. 10/10 <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird-Rumored to be Mariah's last single from this album. By far, one of the best tracks on the album. She returns to her gospel roots. 10/10 <br /> <br />Don't Forget About Us-More enjoyable than We Belong Together. This was also a #1 hit. A great R&B song. One of my favorite Mariah singles since 1997. 10/10 <br /> <br />Makin It Last All Night-This song is great, however, let's pray it doesn't become a single. 7/10 <br /> <br />So Lonely featuring. Twista-Not as great as One and Only, however, it's fun. 9/10 <br /> <br />We Belong Together Remix-FILLER! <br /> <br />Overall, great album! Can't wait for future Mariah work! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This is perhaps one of the best adatations of Pride & Prejudice I've seen yet. From the opening scenes to the last I was absolutly captivated. I can't explain it any other way then that. Though some liberties have been taken, it still makes for a wonderful love story, though it does help if you've read the book to follow along sometimes. It is perhaps on of the best movies I've seen in a long long time.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|King Kong is so awsome I loved this movie so epic so majestic. I saw this movie three times in theaters! And I love it so much can't wait for the 2-disc set to come out which is March, 28 2006 can't wait for that date!!!!!!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I love these DVDs!  I'm a big fan of The OC though.  I enjoyed the first season more, but the 2nd season is great too!  There aren't a lot of special features, but enough to satisfy me!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This expensive package delivers more than promised. The DVDs are beautifully edited, sound wonderful in both surround and stereo and the cd is slightly crisper than the original cd. If you have seen Bruce S. since 1980 and have no idea about what he used to do with the E st. dudes, here is your chance to learn what all us R&R Dinosaurs have been raveing about. I was lucky enough to see the band in Mobile,Al of all places in 1976 and was blown away by the staging, lighting, theatrics[meant in the best ssense] but mostttly by the music and poetry of the lyrics. Bruce acted out the part of most of Greetings, E st.shuffle,and Born to run with a few Detroit medley covers for encores.<br /><br />All that is on the concert dvd in wonderful fidelity. You will love this concert dvd which is worth the price itself. But you get the obsessive making of Born to Run also. What an insight...<br /><br />If you like this music at all, you will love knowing what went into putting the sounds inside Bruce's head on vinyl. If you make one impulse purchase this year, make it this one.
038572179X|5.0|This is a superb novel - the title explains it all. The story will remain with you for a long time.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Some artists write radio-friendly songs full of catchy lyrics and addictive melodies. Filled with pop beats and spot-on harmonies, they serve as a pleasant way to pass an afternoon. <br /> <br />Some artists challenge everything we know about music, breaking the rules and painting colorful songs with raw lyrics and heart-wrenching melodies, roughened with honesty. <br /> <br />Damien Rice falls into the latter category. <br /> <br />On \\"O\\", the Irish songwriter pens ten songs with heartbreak, hope, and a lack of style that is at once attractive and touching. Some tunes feature just Rice on guitar with piano and drums, while others feature a more luscious string ensemble and tender vocals. Songs like 'Cheers Darlin' and 'I Remember' contain a near-jazz vibe; tunes 'Cannonball' and 'Amie' portray beauty in an organic sense. And 'The Blower's Daughter' and 'Cold Water' never fail to shock me with their honesty and unpretensiousness. <br /> <br />A friend recommended Damien Rice to me while I was living in Ireland, and since purchasing the album it has rarely left my CD player. It is at once different and touching, an album you'll not soon forget.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|The music in the movie is every bit as good as the music in the stage production, but then, why wouldn't it be? It's still Weber's music, after all. <br /> <br />I wish I could say the rest of  the movie was as good as the play, but it definitely falls short. The changes, I suspect, were made so the movie would appeal to a younger generation, but the movie lacks the power of the play. Also, the play's shortcomings seem more emphasized in the movie. The TV version of Phantom of the Opera, starring Charles Dance, tells a much more believable story.  <br /> <br />Too bad Weber's music and the Dance movie can't be merged!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is the greatest album ever made without a doubt. It was released March 27,1973 and had an impact right away. It stayed on Billboards top 200 Chart for 741 weeks and consectively for 591 weeks. This was the first time anyone that wasn't into undergrond Brit Rock was exposed to Floyd and boy what an impact they made.    True fans of the group who have followed them their whole career know just how great a songwriter Roger Waters is, so really, I can't say Dark Side is his greatest piece of work(that would be \\"The Wall\\"). However, I do think this is the entire band's best work. There was no fight for control of the band at this point and everyone was working quite well together. This also displays David Gilmour's best guitar work. The Solo on \\"Time\\" is one of the top 10 greatest of all-time and Gilmour's second greatest(\\"Comfortably Numb\\"). His solo on the other Billboard top 15 hit,\\"Money\\", is also quite good.    There are several instrumentals on this album including \\"On the Run\\" and \\"Any Colour You Like\\". All an all I gave this album 5 stars, because it not only displays the greatness of Gilmour, but also the greatness of Richard Wright(keyboards) and Nick Mason(Drums). It is Floyd's most complete album and deserves every bit, if not more of the praise it has recived over the years. I suggest this to any fan of great rock music.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|With a great cast and a great story,how can you possibly go wrong? Easy if you don't understand the period in which the story is set.  This could have been great with better direction. Try the BBC'S NORTH and SOUTH for a wonderful English period film. It's a masterpiece!!!!!
B00006DEF9|5.0|American in Paris &  Singing in  the  Rain  are  stories  from  a  time  long  that  no  longer  exists  .  .  .  with  sweet  music  &  excellent  dance.    They  are  an  excellent  education  for  the  young  &  an  escape  for  adults  trapped  in  60  hour  work  weeks.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Grand CD! Saw Buble show at the Mohegan Arena and along with the excited and appreciate capacity crowd now can tell our friends and families that we saw him when.... What a performance.. fun, electric and vocally perfect. <br /> <br />Love the energy and feeling injected smoothly into all the songs on this cd - special mention for: save the last dance and feeling good. Perfect for all ages of music fans.
B00005JMX6|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made. A must have for any collection.
006056251X|2.0|I have quite a few of Kleypas's books but after reading the last two I am becoming less of a fan. The first \\"Wallflower\\" series books was definitely the best of the bunch. My main gripe with the book is that there is no sexual tension, no teasing buildup to the big love scene. Evie and Sebastian elope and do the deed within the first 4 chapters.  <br />Additionally, the backstory is a re-tread of the gambling house from Dreaming of You - a much better book.  <br /> <br />Worth a read only if you are a Kleypas fan and you get it from the library.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|GET THIS DUNE FANS! This Is A Very Good Movie! With The Extras Its PERFECT!
B00015HVI8|4.0|This season was by far the weakest season yet.  I think they did a pretty poor job of replacing Daniel Jackson and they would have been better off taking the series in a different direction for a season. <br /> <br />Overall, I did enjoy the season, just not as much as I had enjoyed previous seasons.  I recommend purchasing this to complete your set and if anything to get you excited about whats coming up next.
0767818040|4.0|De Palma should have hired Tom Hanks to play the part of Jake Scully.  He would have been perfect with his neo-Jimmy Stewart persona and bumbling charm, that might have so easily turned to obsession.  He wasn't averse to Hanks, hiring him later for the fiasco that became THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES.  Maybe he just liked Craig Wasson's look (if you can call it a look).  The only time Wasson looks halfway appealing is in his \\"Pee Wee\\" outfit, in a tight striped sweater and bowtie, at the beginning of the video for RELAX, by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, one of the seriously demented sequences in BODY DOUBLE.<br /><br />We watched this DVD not long ago and I was surprised to see that Melanie Griffith, whose name and image are all over the box, does not appear in the movie until after an hour of footage and exposition.  Indeed she makes her first appearance at 1 hour 12 minutes.  I'm still debating whether or not she appears in disguise earlier in the movie, but I don't want to reveal any spoilers here so I'll just post my wonder in a series of expostulating, highly verbal question marks.  Griffith isn't good and she isn't bad, playing what (after BLOW OUT and DRESSED TO KILL) must have been considered the \\"Nancy Allen\\" part, the blowsy, down to earth comic role, who free of deadly romanticism herself, brings a breath of fresh air to a neurotic male lead.  It's a refreshing conception, but I think Nancy Allen does it better.  And that's saying something, considering how awful Nancy Allen is in everything, including the aforementioned films, and yet we keep watching her because she's so fearless and alive.  Melanie Griffith is said to have beat out some actual porn stars to land the role of Holly Body; she must have studied some porn footage, though she isn't called on to perform anything hardcore.<br /><br />And speaking of hardcore, isn't that Lane Davies (later Mason Capwell on SANTA BARBARA) as one of the aspiring actors looking for a job?  He's pictured glowering on a set of steps in a pair of blue jeans and sporting the most outrageous basket I've seen in the movies since the old Steve Reeves peplum movies!  Whatever happened to Lane Davies?  He was for a brief period the best American actor going.  Then all of a sudden he just seemed to disappear.n a set of steps in a pair of blue jeans and sporting the most outrageous basket I've seen in the movies since the old Steve Reeves peplum movies!

B000002MG1|5.0|I remember when my roommate brought this home from the record store right when it came out.  I wanted to hate it so bad.  I was so down on REM.  I mean \\"Out of Time\\" stunk soooo bad it was embarrasing.  It was as if the band imploded. <br /> <br />But this album, what a comeback.  The songcraft is suberb and always interesting.  But the best thing about it is the mood it creates, melancholy - but not sad.  Not much more to be said - just a solid album. <br /> <br />BTW - all the reviews saying this is REM's last great album are off base.  New Adventures in Hi-Fi is better than this one (That was their last great album).
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Very Great Movie! Would Tell Every Donnie Darko Fan To Get This For There Personal Collection!
B00005N5S5|3.0|The Terminator is undoubtedly a great movie, with lots of violence, a unusual amount of shot people, especially cops (in the famous police station scene), and also one of the last chances to see Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the \\"bad guy/ciborg\\". With a very imaginative plot by director James Cameron, this film and it's sequels (specially \\"Terminator 2\\", which in my opinioon is the best action movie EVER made), are great fun to watch. <br />However, I was very dissapointed with this DVD, as it has almost no special features whatsoever, except for the original trailer and some crappy dvd-rom feature. Shame on MGM to release such a poor DVD version of this great movie.
B00005MP58|5.0|My mother and father would talk of the movie often and I never thought to watch.  I came across it by accident on the A&E Classroom program. <br /> <br />I was instantly hooked.  I was on the phone with my mother asking questions of things I had missed and what was to come.  A&E was showing one episode per day and I couldn't wait to see the next.  My mother brought me the VHS set and I watched it back to back.  I ended up buying the DVD and yes there is a difference in the picture between the VHS and DVD, but nothing to sneeze at.   <br /> <br />The DVD is just perfect. This is the best movie I have ever seen.  I have watched it so many times that I have lost count.  Every time you watch it, you see or hear something you may have missed.  You end up watching the characters in the background too.  All the actors are the perfect fit for the characters they portray.  Mr & Mrs Bennett, Mr Collins, Bingley, Elizabeth and all her sisters and yes.... Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.  You fall in love with Darcy.  You can see that Darcy loves her, you don't need to hear him speak the words. He just adores her.  What woman wouldn't want to be loved like that. <br /> <br />My husband and teenage son have watched it several times even though it is a \\"Chick Flick\\".   Even when I am doing my housework, I put the DVD in and listen as I go. <br /> <br />You will enjoy this more than words can say.  ENJOY! <br /> <br />If you have never seen this movie.  Watch It!  Buy It!
0671027344|5.0|I first read The Perks of Being a Wallflower in my freshman year of High School. I felt all too close to Charlie and his experiences, at a time when you are yanked out of childhood and pushed into a world of confusion and change this book is a help and inspiration. Charlie's experiences went hand-in-hand with the happenings in my own life. This book is an excellent read for all people, especially teenagers who feel as if they are alone in their views and perspectives on the world.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Aside from that, this is a lovely adaptation. As to the complaints about cuts and re-working of scenes, the film makers didn't have the luxury of five hours to tell the tale verbatum. I took my two nephews (age 16 & 14) to see this, and they both liked it. The older one is an avid reader who had been told by an older brother that Austen was dry and boring, so he expected to hate the movie going in and didn't. Now he's reading Austen and enjoying it. So where is the harm in knowing this is an adaptation and won't be completely faithful to the book? If you want a completely faithful version of the book, read the book.<br /><br />As to the particulars about my choice of rating: Keira Knightly is lovely as Elizabeth without outshining Rosamund Pike in beauty as Jane. Matthew Macfadyen does an outstanding job of showing us what Mr. Darcy is feeling and thinking. There's no other way to portray it in a movie; in the book, Austen puts us into his head so he doesn't have to show it. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn shine as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, presenting them as warm, real human beings rather than charactures. And Tom Hollander gives an amazing and completely different read on Mr. Collins. Usually played as a complete buffoon, here he is an ackward misanthrope who seems aware of the fact that there's something not quite right with how he comes across. It would have been nice if Judi Dench's scenes as Lady Catherine hadn't been cut so much, but there's that time restraint coming into play. Plus, you can't have everything.<br /><br />As to this DVD: Nice rendering. Good picture. Lovely sound. I only wish that the extras were a little more beefed up. I was sad to find no deleted scenes. However, the behind-the-scenes and interviews with the cast and crew are extensive and well done.<br /><br />Also recommended DVDs: BBC version, North & South (Elizabeth Gaskell), Wives & Daughters (also Gaskell), Sense and Sensibility (Emma Thompson version)

B00004RF9I|5.0|I just watched this movie for the first time and I'm very impressed. The script is astounding, the actors brilliant, the subject matter is as relevant today as yesterday. I'm gonna watch it again today or tomorrow. Faye Dunaway is so incredibly well cast for the role, she really looks like she is as insensitive as her character is, all the while showing that her sensibility is not far behind, her emotions show but she can not get herself to put them in front and act upon them. She also is amazing when her character is inspired by creative genius at her job. Finch (Beale) is obviously remarkable, not a hint of insincerity can be  heard in his masterful scenes. Holden is kinda different, he has the lead role, he's on the front for the most time and obviously strives to bring depth to his character, which is not an easy task. And his play is far from perfect, yet he manages to make a sympathetic guy out of his character, quite believable especially in his love-relationships scenes. <br />What to say? The movie is overall very impressive, sometimes astounding. The script is, IMHO, what holds it all together. I'm very much interested in watching other movies written by Paddy Chayefsky. Some reviewers have called his writing wordy, even unbearably so, but I completely disagree. It seems that what these viewers couldnt stand is precisely what I loved. No, it never sounded like the scriptwriter was using his characters as tools to speak his own mind. There are quite a bunch of incredible scenes, Beale's acts, the CEO's monologue, some Diane (Faye Dunaway) scenes as well. Hell where can you find a movie that has quite a few incredible scenes like these, and still brings them all together inside a story that is riveting and as relevant today as it was 30 years ago? That sums it up for me. <br /> <br />Then I should mention the insights of Mr Chayefsky. He is saying things that still are not understood today by the majority. His movie is still prophetic today, in 2006. Especially the monologue about the corporatization of the planet. <br /> <br />I've had the feeling while watching this movie, that the scriptwriter had the rare quality, found in shakespeare, of appealing to every type of audiences at once : action, emotions, ideas, and ideals are all adressed efficiently and blended into a lively whole. It's a rare treat and I'm gonna hunt for this Chayefsky's work.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|<br />  As a fan of Mark Knopfler I've been making my own Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler compilations for years.  I'ts so gratifying to know that these guys (particularly Knopfler) have finally decided to do the same. <br /> <br />  My one complaint:  Why no songs from Mark Knopfler's debut solo album: \\"Golden Heart\\"?  Not even one song was included here on this 2 disc compilation from Knopfler's AMAZING debut album.  Strange choice indeed.  At least \\"Darling Pretty\\" or even \\"Golden Heart\\" could've been represented on this collection.  Who needed another collection with \\"Private Investigations\\" or \\"Going Home Theme\\"?  Tell me who!? <br /> <br />  Anyway, aside from all that, this is a wonderful compilation. <br />Heavy on the Dire Straits ballads, and rich in Knopfler's solo movie instrumentals and classic rock journey this compilation can't miss! <br /> <br />  Put your CD player on \\"random\\" and you'll get great song after great song.  Not only that but we get treated to a new song from Knopfler's forthcoming album with Emmy Lou Harris. <br />\\"All The Roadrunning\\"  A true gem indeed. <br /> <br />From the classic Dire Straits folk/rock ballad: \\"Telegraph Road\\" or the reminiscent: \\"So Far Away\\" <br />to the Mark Knopfler we know and enjoy today (there's no room for filler here anyway). Youre in for the rich reward and craftmanship that was Dire Straits and is now Mark Knopfler.  <br /> <br />These songs are from the mind of a master guitarist and songwriter.  A world apart from the worthless spatter you hear on the radio waves these days. <br /> <br />Amen!

1402714572|4.0|The book Treasure Island is an exciting book. It contains mutineers, pirates, and a big treasure. It is a challenging book to read though. There are loops and turns around every corner. Jim, the main character comes across a ship called the Hispaniola, and rode it for the rest of the book. He takes on many troubles throughout the book. At first, he meets a man called Long John Silver. He seems very nice at first but at the end, he finds out something about Silver.  <br /> There tends to be mutinies when a ship sets off for treasure, and that's exactly what happens.  <br />One day, the ship is sailing on and BOOM! There sounds a gunshot! The wicked mutineers attack the ship killing one person, shooting them in the head. But it's not over yet! Three muskets go off at a time and one of the mutineers falls. The fight goes on and it is soon found out that the mutineers had lost more souls then the ships company and that was good for Jim.  <br />At one point in the book, Jim comes across a man that was on an island that had been marooned and he had been there for over three years and had to live off eating goat.  <br />The sentence structure of the book was a very hard. The sentences were very hard to read and there were a lot of things going on at the same time and it never seemed to end.  One reason that the book was so hard was it was almost a different kind of English. The book was written in the late 1800 so it was very hard to understand. The sentences were long and choppy and they went on. But on the other hand some sentences were only two words.   <br /> The word choice of the book was two ways mostly. That means that some words were long and some words were very short.  But the words were switched around so it was even harder to read.   <br />The description of the book was not so great. Robert didn't describe the setting too well. Sometimes you couldn't tell where Jim was at some points because of the poor description.  <br /> My opinion of the book was not so great and it was hard to understand because of the word choice and the settings were very bad at some points.  At one part of the book Jim comes off the ship and it doesn't explain what was happening and it seemed there was something missing. And at some points it seemed that the word were too long and you were waiting for something else to happen and it got boring. After some sentences it was so confusing that you had to read it again until you got what was going on. That was hard to do and that's one reason I didn't like the book all that much.  <br /> I think that the appropriate age for reading this book is about 13 or 14 yeas old.  I think that it was not so good for my age because I didn't understand it all that much, and if someone were older, then they have a better learning experience and they can understand the hard words. I am only eleven years old and this book is not such a good book for my age.  <br />Ben Schwartz 6th Grade

Definitely good brain food. <br /> <br />However, I had to hold my nose from the stench of P.C. <br /> <br />It seems that the driving force behind Mr. Diamond's research is to prove that white Europeans undeservedly got good breaks. And those poor Africans have been cursed by bad luck all the way, when actually the Europeans are the scum of the earth and don't deserve a thing that they have. <br /> <br />Ugh! When will this P.C. rage subside?
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Excellent DVD set! <br /> <br />It was great to be able to watch the complete season without the interruptions of ads! <br /> <br />Another annoying habit of free to air TV is the way the programmers sometimes can chop and change the screening of episodes therefore creating \\"out of sync\\" episodes. <br /> <br />The best way to watch a television series! <br /> <br />I recommend this series as it is funny, fast paced and interesting screen writing! <br /> <br />

No, it doesn't have much of a plot and yes the jokes are stupid. It's one of those \\"so stupid it's funny\\" movies. I guess you either love it or hate it.

Something that God would strop his razor over, waiting to mete justice upon the speaker. But that is just the thing. That very expectation is something believed upon, in faith. It is purely a \\"faith\\" thing to feel assured of knowing exactly what it is that pleases and displeases God.<br /><br />Harris's book is a real eye-opener, it really is.<br /><br />It is a pail of cold water, right in the face of this topic of \\"faith\\"!<br /><br />He shows us that the religious world we currently live in is a veritable ocean foaming over with bad ideas. It is a world in which religious conviction has grown in inverse proportion to its justification. What passes for religious superiority is often nothing more than blind adherence to abysmal ignorance.<br /><br />One of the things I most enjoyed was the chapter that focussed on discussing the difference between \\"belief\\" (believing) and \\"knowledge\\" (knowing).<br /><br />The book is a definite plea to recognize the present-day ascendency of unreason.<br /><br />But, at the same time, it does not (in my opinion) argue atheism as a dogma.<br /><br />Nowhere does the book deny the importance of spirituality in our lives. However, it advocates finding approaches to ethics and to spiritual experience that make no appeal to faith. At first, that may sound quite confusing, even contradictory to some readers, but all I can say is... read the book. If the door of your mind is not welded shut, you will understand what is being said in here.<br /><br />It is a cry to acknowledge the dangers inherent in the practise of unquestionable faith.<br /><br />But it is not a battle cry against anyone.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|This album is great. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is not every song holds up to the \\"awesome\\" standard. The radio played Hung Up and Sorry get the best action here. But, overall, this album will get you up and keep you moving. If you like solid heart-felt-bass dance, you will like this album. If you are looking for more electric-synth type dance, or something like NYC dance, this may not be the best for you.  <br />My advice, for the money - its definately worth it. Enjoy!

The effects of course are old but you have to give them credit, the movie was made in the 80's. They show a lot of deleted scenes and it gives you the option of the theatrical version or the new extended edition. The packaging is great, it's like a tin can.<br /><br />overall love the new DUNE

006056251X|4.0|Evie Jenner, daughter of Ivo Jenner, which we know from other Kleypas novels, is a perpetual wallflower.  She is pretty but painfully shy and has a speech impediment that makes communication embarrassing for her.  (Please read the other Wallflower series before you read this book)    Sebastian is a rakehell, who is destitude.  Evie approaches him with an offer he can't refuse.  Marriage.  She needs to escape, he needs a dowry.  It is a perfect match.      Kleypas always writes the best heroes...complicated, and difficult to love.  I am always challenged by her novels and this was no exception. You won't be disappointed by her latest work.      I am a huge fan of Kleypas, so after reading all her books numerous times I have come to know her writing style.  In her earlier books you could always count on a catasrophic illness that took several pages to conclude and in the end they would realize they loved each other. Story over...    I could sniff this coming a mile away. Despite enjoying the book in the end I wished she had gone another route. We had just endured the sickbed of her father and going through it again was too much.  I would have prefered some reckoning for Evie...like having Evie confront her family without stuttering...or Sebastian really showing his devotion in some other manner.
B0007PAMR4|2.0|There are enough reviews of the original version out there already, so I will confine my remarks to the \\"Extended\\" Version only.  When I first caught a glimpse of this version years and years ago on cable I was intrigued.  An extra 35-40 minutes of Dune can't be a bad thing, right? <br /> <br />Oh how naive and young I was then.  The extended version is a train wreck from begiing to end.  The additional voice over narration in the beginning is fun for about 60 seconds and then gets annoying - especially when combined with still shots of a production picture/painting.  The effect is not unlike the early Marvel Cartoons for Capt. America and Iron Man and Thor - the camera moves over a picture giving the illusion of motion. <br /> <br />Anyway, the additional movie footage (this is, actually using actors and not pictures) doesn't add any appreciable depth to the movie as a whole.  An added sequence with Gurney (Patrick Stewart)reciting some poetry during a council of war elicits a chuckle but dosn't improve the movie at all.  Likewise, a meeting with Keynes, Thufir, Paul, Gurney and Duke Leto where Dr. Keynes spits on the floor gives a little more color to the Fremen appreciation for water and its value, but it doesn't move the story forward.  Also realize that some of the added footage is merely some footage looped again and again - see the Harkonen assault on the Atreides forces on Arakis.  Yes, that is the same shot of the Emporer's shock troops. Its also the same shot of the space ships, etc. <br /> <br />On the plus side, some of the trivia and production info that comes with the discs is interesting, but he absence of David Lynch from the entire product is a glaring omission that tranishes anything that the production crew says about him.  I know Lynch is not happy with this product, so the production people constatnly referencing him just underscores his absence. <br /> <br />The original theatrical version is still there but I didn't find it to be any better, brighter, clearer or any other adjective.  Maybe its because I'm working on a lower grade dvd player, but I suspect that they didn't do any \\"remastering\\" or \\"enhancing\\" whatsoever. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong:  I am a huge fan of all the books and the original movie.  This DVD release, though, is not worth anything to anyone but the most die-hard of fans.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|'Sultans of Swing', of course, is a classic but this self titled album by Dire Straits is possibly one of the best debuts in classic rock history. Mark Knopfler is (simply put)a guitar genius that belongs in the company of classic rock masters like Hendrix, Clapton, Page, Santana, Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughan, etc. Polished to the hilt, this first album by Dire Straits is a must own for lovers of any rock guitar virtuoso like Knopfler.

B000850IHW|5.0|I was 16 when as part of a Rock Band I discovered GG.  It really changed the way I approached my musical interests.  Intricate, detailed arrangements. Constant changes of signature, spacing and feel.  In the same class, no doubt!!! of YES, CRIMSON, ELP, EARLY GENESIS.  Probably superior in several categories (ex. all were multi-instrumentalists) to these more recognizable bands. I presented these material to musically-trained, younger members of my family and they were amazed at the quality and complex beauty of GG's portfolio.  Highly recommended to serious listeners, musicians and plain lovers of good contemporary music.

All I have to say is this is a magnificent book that shows the differences of families and that anyone that wants to have a family deserves it.  Granted, it's about penguins, but it still makes a very important point.  I want my daughter to be raised with tolerence of people that are different and of families that might not be your conventional family.  I don't want her to grow up thinking that certain groups of people shouldn't get to have the same rights that her mommy and daddy do.  This book is a great start.
0684824906|5.0|An in depth study Abraham Lincoln's political genius.  A must-read for politicos and political aficianados, civil war era history buffs, and importantly - any leader who is trying to build a team.
0609610570|4.0|Aha! A generic program-of-the-month book.  The basic approach recommended by the authors is Management By Initiative.  Get one \\"initiative\\" going, and move on to the next when the first is still underway.  Make sure, naturally, you have the necessary resources in place to execute the initiative.  Initiatives inherently focus on specific issues while slighting others.<br /><br />One example from the book is enough to challenge its thought consistency and its credibility.  When the head of purchasing in an organization claimed it needed twenty engineers to work with vendors on cost reduction, the head of engineering balked.  Bossidy salutes the CEO who \\"coaches\\" the VP of engineering into understanding how he will have 20 engineers working with purchasing by the following Monday.  He doesn't ask what tasks the 20 engineers are working on or the negative impact that will have on the chain of people working with these people.  The \\"initiative\\" of the day requires 20 engineers.  Dilbert has a new job on Monday, and probably keeps his old one too.  In another example, Bossidy describes chiding a manager whose people are working seven days a week, and in a third he commends a CEO whose team works 7 days a week for 10 weeks to build a new strategy and execution plan.  Sort of \\"do as I say, not as I do?\\"<br /><br />The second bugaboo is Bossidy's insistence that \\"the customer is first.\\"  But what that means, and how subordinates are supposed to live with that mantra is never explained.  Bossidy couldn't make his numbers at Allied Signal AND keep customers happy, so he sold off those businesses.  It isn't mentioned in the book, but Lear looked at the same markets and problems and found a way to address them more successfully, though not without ongoing struggle.  Sure, this is a simplistic view, but \\"the customer is first\\" without a framework, is a guaranteed death spiral.<br /><br />Bossidy claims to be Six Sigma advocate, but he never offers his framework for its application or a specific example of how it worked.  So, Execution's an interesting contrast to the more fundamental and enterprise wide process improvement approach being driven for example by lean advocates.  Again, everything is a series of \\"initiatives.\\"  Bossidy argues that initiatives won't be seen as \\"flavors of the month\\" if the initiatives are properly executed.<br /><br />The meatiest against-the-grain thought in the book is that senior management has to be directly and intimately involved in initiatives and operations.  That thought has to be a distasteful shock to most American senior management, reason enough to burn the book.  And, the authors clearly don't think a sociopathic personality is essential for strong, senior management, another shock.<br /><br />Also to their credit they recognize failure is often driven from the top by CEO's who aren't up to the task, and they offer a few names.  I suspect the follow on book, Confronting Reality, which simply rehashes some of Execution's material, is a result of the frustration from working as consultants and on boards with intransigent people after Execution was published.  One of the main weaknesses is a shortage of examples of successes, with details of pivotal points along the way.<br /><br />Given the title Execution, the unsurprising main message of the book is that great ideas, great strategies are nothing without execution.  True, and all too often assumed rather than driven.  The writing's good enough to keep your eyes open on a short flight.  The authors have significant and credible experience so it's worth one read if only to drink a bit from that trough, then pass it on.  And if you haven't read it, think defensively, the same colleague who gave you Who Moved My Cheese? is going to give it to you anyway.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best books I have ever read! The story is set in a small, old town, Maycomb County, where a black man called Tom Robinson is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch, who works at the state legislature, defends for Tom.  <br /> <br />    The story is written from the point of view of Scout Finch, who is Atticus's youngest daughter. Because of her innocence and curiosity, Scout often finds it hard to understand why adults act in certain ways. She makes simple, but true and honest remarks about the world around her - about how life can sometimes be so unfair. Scout's thoughts often make me reflect on my own opinions of life.  <br /> <br />     This book is definitely a page-turner! I am very touched by Scout's relationship with her family. To me, Atticus is the best father a daughter could ever ask for. He is intelligent and patient. By defending for Tom Robinson in court, Atticus teaches his children to follow their hearts and \\"do the right things\\" even when others condemn them for doing so.  <br /> <br />     By the time I finished the book, I felt like I was one of the characters in the story. I almost thought that I was standing beside Scout and watching her learn more and more about life. Harper Lee has written her book with such vivid details that any reader can easily be captured into the story she created.

B000BGH22W|3.0|I got this CD last week, hoping to add it to my \\"study music\\" collection.  My current educational setting-pharmacy school-requires me to be studying pretty constantly, and I generally have some soundtrack or another playing as I read.  Since I got this CD, I have probably listened to it ten or twelve times.  I still could not sing you a single note from memory.   <br />While Doyle's music is pretty, it has no memorable musical motives to draw the listener in.  Each piece contains its own random, wandering nonmelody, with only the barest threads of continuity from one track to the next.  Even within each of the pieces there is a serious lack of definite musical ideas.  The result: forgettable, atmospheric music that fails to create an identity of its own.  Many reviewers draw comparisons to John Williams' compositions for the first three films in the Potter series, and I think that the only thing to be said is any musical identity created by Williams has been largely neglected.  True, the tone of Rowling's stories changes dramatically with \\"Goblet\\"; however I feel such a complete change in musical style and motif was really unnecessary to the development of the story. <br />Don't get me wrong; the album isn't a complete bust.  Tracks 3 and 11 are okay.  In particular, I really like track 21, \\"Hogwarts Hymn.\\"  It kind of reminds me of a slower, wistful, thoughtful version of Elgar's \\"Pomp and Circumstance.\\"  (You can almost hear Hermione say, \\"Everything's going to change now, isn't it?\\") <br />My advice: borrow it, check it out from the library or something before you buy it for yourself.  At least then you know what you're getting into ahead of time.  If you like it enough to buy it, great.  I personally am not impressed.  I need something with a little more substance.   <br />Three stars, only because I can't give it two and a half. <br />
0671799320|3.0|I read this book, translated to portuguese, here in Brazil.This book is good to read, but has some failures.At first, the history ends in 1990.In other words, this book is now a little outdated.I don't know if this ediction is now updated.  The second failures in this book is that it doesn't tells basically nothing about Brazil.I read it from the firts to the last word.\\"Brazil\\" is writen only one time, as a scale to a trip to Saudi Arabia.  In fact Brazil had a part ridiculous, part fun , oil's history.Oil here was(and sometimes continuous to be) a demagogue's god.In 1980 decade, Brazil was producing more oil then Barain.Today in fact, Brazil produces more oil, then Lybia , Egipt,Argentina and Algeria.And this book tells nothing about oil in Brazil.  Today, Brazil is a net oil's export.In fact Brazil will produce about about 3,000,000 brents each day, in less than one decade.  Brazil will have decline about the same time or even after countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq,Iran,etc.Having so many oil in deep ocean, Brazil will grow his oil's production for many decades , in this century.It's possible that Brazil will be the biggest oil's producer in the world, about the half of this century.  Being outdated and failed about Brazil, I'll give 3 stars for this book.
B00005JO1J|3.0|That's what performance artist Maureen tries to get her audience to say in her one-woman show protesting her landlord. But it describes the music, too - much of it comprises overblown show-rock that sounds like it came from The Lost Meat Loaf Tapes. \\"Moo,\\" indeed. <br /> <br />The movie is set in 1989-90 but only one character, the hapless Bon Jovi wannabe Roger, actually takes on the thankless task of looking like he was from that era - everyone else appears up-to-date. <br /> <br />On the plus side, there's a nice, comfy vibe between the actors. It's not as self-consciously big-budget/star-power as \\"Chicago,\\" but neither is it as clever or catchy. If you're not interested in an adrenaline rush, \\"Rent\\" is the movie-musical for you - conflict is minimal. Unfortunately, this means that the movie drags, and surprises are rare. <br />
B000E8N690|4.0|WALK THE LINE is a well done, convincing portrait of one of country music's greatest stars.  While not a fan of Mr. Cash myself, I learned a lot more about the man via this movie.  Why it works undoubtedly is the performances given by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Having won Golden Globes for their performances, the two stars are up for Oscars this Sunday as well, and Ms. Witherspoon is a frontrunner.<br /><br />Phoenix captures the essence of Cash in his physical movements, although ironically, he's probably got a better singing voice than Cash.  He evolves from the starstruck youth to a confident star, although he falls victim to alcohol and drugs.<br /><br />Witherspoon doesn't quite lose her Legally Blonde persona, but as the darkhaired June Carter, she excels in evincing the emotional upheaval Cash brought into her life.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin as Vivian, Cash's first wife, does a fine job as she watches Cash grow further and further from his family life and into Carter's arms.  Robert Patrick is good as Cash's distant and seemingly insensitive father and country/pop singer Shelby Lynne makes a convincing Mama Cash.<br /><br />While James Mangold's direction is very good, the movie itself seems a little too sanitized at times, although exposing Cash's weaknesses is commendable.  A good biopic all around.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I will admit that at first I was skeptical about this CD. I've always been a Madonna fan, but her last few hits were disappointing. That being said, I am completely hooked on this CD, it's great from beginning to end and and I can't stop listening to it. I'd recommend this CD to all.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|This is a great album made even better by the remix.  The tunes all sound, well, better.  More up front, clearer, snappier.  The versions on Chrome, Smoke & BBQ are of the same remix.  The three live tracks are great, and worth the price of the album:  Waitin' for the Bus, Jesus, & La Grange.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Everyone else has pretty much said it.  I only wish the movie would have done better in the theatre, but that's the public for you.  I've purchased three of these sets as gifts, and they never dissapoint!
B000E0OBK6|1.0|Unfortunately I was dissapointed by Jarhead.  This is mainly due to the action packed previews I saw and loved so much.  As far as I can tell the previews contined almost every second in the film that contained a gun being fired or an explosion.  This lead me to believe there would be a lot of action in the movie.<br /><br />I was also dissapointed by the fact that the scenes in boot camp were plucked straight from Full Metal Jacket.  The dialogue, althought true to life, was unoriginal.<br /><br />I love movies about the first gulf war, of which there are few (Courage under fire, Three Kings, Bravo Two Zero) so I could not wait to see Jarhead. Ultimately my excitement about it probably led to me disliking it more as a result.  However, it was ultimately the previews that portrayed the movie as action packed that proved to be the biggest let down.
0061020680|4.0|I've been reading the Discworld books in order and I have to say, that \\"Mort\\" is one of the better ones I've read.  <br /> <br />At the same time, I also have to say that \\"Mort\\" was not as funny as I thought it would be (hence the title for my review). But there are a few witty passages (THERE'S NO JUSTICE, said Mort. JUST US (page 207)) and ideas (the whole idea of the Holy Listeners was brilliant!).  <br /> <br />The only time I did laugh was the scene with the parody of the \\"I Ching\\" or \\"Book of Change\\" which in \\"Mort\\" is called the \\"Ching Aling\\". I was really able to connect with that scene because I've been unfortunate enough to have read an obscurely worded copy of the \\"I Ching\\". \\"Without verticality, wisely the cochineal emperor goes forth at teatime; at evening the mollusc is silent among the almond blossom. (page 95)\\".  <br /> <br />Mort is a very well developed character and I think that's another reason why I ultimately ended up liking this book even though it was not as funny as some of the previous ones.  <br /> <br />The storyline, too, is also much better than that found in \\"Equal Rites\\". I remember \\"Equal Rites\\" taking a good 50+ pages to get on with the adventure, whereas \\"Mort\\" gets right to the point within a few short scenes.  <br /> <br />Overall, a really good Discworld book. <br /> <br />But Death is still no laughing matter.
B00004RFFS|4.0|The story, based on the book by Anne Rice, is timeless as it shows the vampire not only as bloodsucking fiend but a creature that still possesses humanity. Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst were a great choice for there characters but I don't think \\"sunny boy\\" Tom Cruise makes a good Lestat - he is not beautiful and dreary enough. Read the book \\"The vampire Lestat\\" also by Anne Rice to get a better understanding of his figure.
B000022TSW|5.0|When I First Saw the South Park Movie there were some Kids actually there accompanied by adults, although They did not stay too long. This Movie Makes fun of nearly every Topic Whether its Religion, Political, Sex, or Flatulance. The Music in it also leaves you humming some of the tunes since the words themselves are too profane to mention.  The Plot consists when South Parks Mothers get together to make War With Canada Because of an R Rated movie that was seen by the kids turning them into potty mouths.The idea to Kill Teerance and philip starts the dominoe effect leading to WW3 And the beginning of the end of days with Saddam and satan coming to earth to Reign.  <br />   If your not bothered by crass humor of any sort then you will enjoy this movie as its funnier and pokes jokes at not only our society buy ourselves. In one very funny part where the kids are at the computer, they come across an X Rated site where the only Guard is press an OK Button and agreeing they are over 18.  <br />The Movie is full of jokes like this and should be purchased if you have the chance.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I was never a fan of the Batman series - until this movie came out. In my opinion, this is the best Batman movie as it shows how he unveils his alter-ego. There has never been a better Batman than Christian Bale. He is strong and vulnerable, human and fictitious, dark and yet real. Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are great casts in their respective characters of Alfred and Jim Gordon whereas Katie Holmes gives a rather expected low performance of Bruce's childhood friend Rachel. Her facial expressions remain the same throughout every scene, and she is the only downfall to the movie cast.
1881273156|5.0|We found this book to be a God send.  Helped us understand one another on the inside.  We give it to our newlywed friends.  Strongly recommend to all who are thinking about or already married.
B000E8N690|5.0|Johny Cash is before my time but that doesn't matter. Anyone could watch this movie without knowing anything about him and just fall in love with the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just awesome here as Johny Cash and even puts his oscar nominated performance in Gladiator to shame. I don't know what kind of expressions the real  Johny Cash made but Phoenix literly becomes someone else here almost as if he's possessed.<br /><br />  Cash has a wife and a family and his dream job is to be a singer and after that happens his money is there to support his family but he isn't. Then he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and that complicates his marriage even more since he falls for June instantly. He gets June to to  sing with him which makes his wife jealous, especially when he starts hanging June's pictures all over the walls. On top of that he becomes a pill popper that washes down the pills with beer. Which gets in the way of his marriage, his dream job and keeping his friendship with his dream girl. All that might sound depressing but you'll feel uplifted and happy by the end.<br /><br />  Reese Witherspoon is excellent here and I hear critics say that Philip Seymour Hoffman should win for Capote and that Reese should win best actress. I agree, she should win best actres but how could anyone say she should win and that Joaquin Phoenix shouldn't ? If you listen to the real Johny Cash and the real June Carter sing in the end credits, Phoenix sounds exactly like Johny Cash. While Witherspoon just sorta sounds like June Carter but barely. I'm not knocking her performance, she has a lovely voice and great chemestry with Phoenix period. I just don't see how you could watch this movie and walk away saying that any other actor deserves the award more than Phoenix . I'd love to see them both walk away with oscars. It's their best work in their entire careers. If you don't believe me, just watch this movie.
0452282152|5.0|Griet is sent to work as a maid to the Vermeer family when her father's ill health means her family has no regular source of income.  She finds a life of very hard work, subtle home tensions, innate and unthinking cruelty and a fascination with her Masters beautiful paintings. <br /> <br />Like Vermeers work, this book is not something to be rushed through.  Its full of beautiful small details and a gradual rising tension that explodes towards the end.  Its a slice of Dutch urban life that shows us some of the dangers for the lowly when those above them take an interest in them. <br /> <br />If you are after an action novel or a book of great events this would not suit you.  If you like a book that has beautiful writing and interesting characters as its main appeal this may be a book you'll enjoy. <br />

B00007AJF9|2.0|Elizabeth purports to cover the several years in the life of Elizabeth, during the reign of Queen Mary I and five years into her own reign (according to the end of the film before the credits). Staring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geofrey Rush, Richard Attenborough and an excellent supporting cast (did Emily Mortimer say a word? I was hoping she had speaking lines). <br /> <br />From the beginning it becomes clear this film does not know whether it wants to be a great tragic romance, a political thriller or a history. It does none of them very well. The screenplay, written by Michael Hirst, is a hodge podge of scenes touching on famous points in Elizabeth's early history with little sense of a time line. Perhaps Mr. Hirst was presuming viewers would already be familiar with Elizabeth Tudor to know that years were passing rather than a few months or days. It goes for broke with the Elizabeth/Dudley romance, having them wind up in bed once she's crowned (right on, I say, the only thing I truly liked in this film) and intimating a regular intimate relationship between the two. <br /> <br />The historical inaccuracies are so glaring they make the film almost unwatchable in and of themselves. Elizabeth is protrayed as a politically naive child (which she was not according to historians). The proposed marriage between Dudley and Mary Queen of Scots never makes an appearance (in fact neither does Mary Queen of Scots; perhaps Mary of Guise was supposed to suffice for both women?). William Cecil was created Baron Burghley in the film within five years of Elizabeth's ascension but that did not occur until 1571 in reality. The courtship of Francois, Duke of Anjou and Elizabeth did not occur until 1572 but was wedged into the first five years, as well. The Duke of Norfolk was executed in 1572, not in the first five years of Elizabeth's reign. And so on. <br /> <br />The dialogue is, for the most part, unremarkable and boring. The actors do their best with what they're givenand they make it sound almost plausible. But they can never make up for the fact this film doesn't know what it wants to do. It's more difficult for me to get a read on the director, Shekhar Kapur. I'm not sure if he made the best of a mediocre script or if his skill wasn't on par with the actors with which he was working. I've not seen anything else by him so cannot say. I found the unusual camera angles mildly interesting but, ultimately, they did not bring anything new or interesting to the narrative. <br /> <br />The settings, costumes and cinematography were interesting but hardly worth the Oscar nominations. I mean, Gone with the Wind one best color cinematography in 1939. Does Elizabeth compare? Not even close. <br /> <br />I love a good costume drama as much as the next person and if someone is going to diddle with history they better be very good at it to make it plausible and interesting. Honestly, what happened to the real life Elizabeth and what she caused to happen was as interesting as any scriptwriter and director could want. There was no need to change history, ignore it or condensce it. <br /> <br />Overall, I wanted to like this film and went into it with an open mind, looking forward to Cate Blanchetts' performance. By the end I found myself wishing Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham had been a lot nastier and more blood thirsty for the visceral release of pretending he was torturing the director and script writer. <br /> <br />I'm sorry to say but this movie needed a better screenwriter and a better director to realize its full potential.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver <br />By: Lois Lowry <br />Reviewed by: R.Ajoc <br />Period: 1 <br /> <br /> The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a story about Jonas and his new occupation as he becomes a young adult. Oh the day of training Jonas is chosen to go with The Giver. The Giver is the person in Jonas's community who will remember everything that happens in his community. After one year of training and transmitting of memories from The Giver to Jonas, Jonas was really into the occupation of The Giver. Jonas's intelligence makes him realize that he must show his community what is inside life, and Jonas also stopped all the violence that was going on in his community. Jonas goal as The Giver was to remember all the memories good or bad of his community. As he grew from his twelve year old stature he was not able to transmit or remember any memories. One day as Jonas was going up a hill he forgot all of the memories the last Giver had given to him and the only way to get the memories back was if Jonas left his community boundaries. <br /> The Giver was not as interesting in the beginning as it is towards the end. The beginning didn't give me the feeling that this was going to be a good book. Intentionally I read the rest of the book and realized how interesting it gets during the last few chapters. The beginning sentence of most the chapters were boring: Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee, dose not seem as exciting. Right., if you read on all the detail come in you can see this is the beginning of the day when Jonas is chosen his life occupation. As you can see, if you read on you will see that throughout the whole book. Most of the book is like this \\" It was colder, Jonas perceived.\\", does not look like an important chapter. Right., read on and you will see that this is where Jonas will lose his memory and the memory of his whole community. <br /> On the down side this book is not the type of book that has an adrenaline rush. If you like regular literature this book will be for you. If you like action or anything such as horror, type book this book is not meant for you. This book is the regular type literature that is not with all of the rush and horror that you want. \\" He wanted his childhood again, scraped knees and ball games\\" dose not sound very interesting, for all you people who want a very interesting book that will keep you in your seat for hours this will not be for you. Although it maybe a boring book for those who hate boring books, that are just plain boring and have no action chose another book. <br /> The most touching part f the book is my most favorite part of the book. The part where Jonas must leave his community. Jonas had to leave his community because he forgot all of the communities memories as he was climbing the hill. The reason why it was very touching was because once you leave a community you may never come back. Since leaving the community was the only way for the community to get their memory back, and so everyone could remember everything again. The quote that really says something to me is \\" Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.\\"  This quote showed the feeling as if you are leaving someone or even leaving something behind, forever! If you really look into this quote you will see yes it is a very strong quote.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|First I am a fifty something white guy and I didn't say \\"what's going on\\" to my wife when I saw this movie. Nothing worse than people that want you to see their bold reviewing vision and then they slap someone in the face with a sexist/elderly discremination remark. Gee, like only the MTV generation understands Science Fiction and this movie. Funny but last time I checked Sci Fi was around and being read long before even I was born let alone someone such as yourself. I was probably reading Isaac Asimov before you were born, so what does that prove? One thing, I have learned age and sex have nothing to do with how people interpret SciFi. Now that we got that out of the way, this is a good movie. Some are being overly critical because of the predictable invulnerability of Aeon and how it is overly easy for her to take out everyone else. I too must admit it was a touch heavy handed, but then so was \\"The Matrix\\". The faults are minor when you consider the quality of the story, action, and the effects. Take time to watch it a second time and reflect on it before being so harsh.<br /><br />This movie may seem simple to some, but it has a good deal under the surface. One critical viewer went on about the blimp used to hide the DNA instead of a vault being stupid. I say, not at all. Hiding in plain sight is often quite smart. No one would expect something of great value in a blimp that could be easily shot down or boarded, and the keeper was there to make it seem like something ordinary. Another indicated this was new for a woman to strike out for her believes. Nothing new about a young woman striking out for her believes. Most recently I recall \\"Underworld\\" using that plotline, and then there was \\"Final Fantasy\\", et cetera, but I digress. The story is different in the respect of a different look at a future society. As mentioned previously by a couple truly open minded reviews, that is a tough nut to crack. \\"Logan's Run\\" 30 years later still looks okay even if the effects seem a bit hokey. It holds up because of what they tried to say, not because the F/X were not extreme. SciFi fans will probably like it best, but anyone with an open mind may find it entertaining. I suggest renting before buying. Personally I liked the acting and story so much I am buying it. The trailers did not do this movie justice. They make it look like a mindless action movie. There is much more to it than just some good action and special effects.it hokey. It holds up because of what they tried to say, not because the F/X were not extreme.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah's sound on this album is excellent. Even her detractors have admitted the same. There is a such a rich, velvet sound to these songs. It's easy to get lost in the ambience of each song. Sarah has always had this sound, especially in \\"Fumbling,\\" but in Afterglow she has polished it. <br /> <br />The sound on Afterglow is subtle. She doesn't hit you like she did with Plenty or Possession. The power in this album is the lyrics themselves. They're vague which allows the listener to apply them to their own lives, so each song seems to evoke a different memory and response depending upon who is listening. I imagine a great deal of people with negative or simplistic associations with the lyrics are going to reactive negatively to this album. <br /> <br />\\"Stupid\\" was the first song that won me over because of the contrast between the chorus and the rest of the song. It reminds me so much of how people talk about failed relationships. They ramble on meloncholy about what they miss and in the middle of the discussion belt out something like \\"How could I been so f'n dumb!\\" It's the mix of anger and sorrow that made me fall in love with the song. <br /> <br />Right now, Answer is resonating in my ear.

0393327655|1.0|Sam is an atheist evangelist accusing Christians of being irrational in their unsupported faith. <br />I have talked with Sam and offered to help set up a public debate with William Lane Craig over the subject of the ressurection of Christ and the existence of God. He rejected this idea, and here's exactly what he said: <br /> <br />\\"I've read Craig's work.  I can't imagine our debate would go very well.  I think the evidence for the divinity of Jesus is profoundly weak--but I am humbled by how difficult it is to convince someone of this in conversation.\\" <br /> <br />I also suggested to no avail a debate with Phillip Johnson (Darwin on Trial), or Michael Behe (Darwin's Black Box). <br /> <br />Sam accuses Christianity of having no evidence, yet he will not debate highly qualified people who can present convincing evidence. <br /> <br />Having said this, I do recommend the book to Christians for the purpose of exercising your skills in defending the faith against quality arguments.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Simply put, this is the greatest album I have ever heard, and will probably ever hear.  Once was my first Nightwish album and is in my opinion definately the best, with the previous album, Century Child, coming in at a close 2nd.  Many Nightwish fans argue that Wishmaster is better than Once, but I must disagree.  As for Angels Fall First and Oceanborn, I have not yet heard them so I cannot compare. <br /> <br />The Opening track \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" gets things off to a rocking start, followed by the awesome singles \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" and \\"Nemo\\".  WIHaA is a very \\"different\\" song for Nightwish, almost touching on a techno-type beat, but still managing to come off sounding like an A-class metal song.  \\"Nemo\\" is one of my favourite tracks of all time.  The guitars cut out during the first few verses leaving Tarja singing with only drums and ominous bass guitar.  Of course when the chorusses come around some of the heaviest melodic guitar you will ever hear punches in, and during the outro the orchestra even makes an appearance to give the song that extra power.  Again, the extensive use of a full orchestra and choir on this album is something many traditional Nightwish fans feel was too much of a departure from the band's earlier sound, but in my opinion any time a metal band can mix in such exquisite orchestral arrangements it only helps to make songs infinitely more powerful and interesting. <br /> <br />\\"Planet Hell\\" and \\"Romanticide\\" are among the fastest tracks on the album and will bring out the headbanger in anyone's grandmother, while slower ballads such as the finnish \\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\", which features a beautiful cello interlude, serve to rouse the emotions and make the listener feel the music.  Another slower song is \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\", which features a native american theme, even bringing in a flute solo not unlike that on \\"Forever Yours\\" (from the Century Chold album).  This track also has beautiful oration and chanting performed by JohnTwo-Hawks.  The album's crowning acheivement and in fact, the best song of all time by any band, has to be the massive ballad \\"Ghost Love Score\\".  This song is really long, but thanks to numerous shifts in pace is not tedious for even one second.  The orchestra and choirs take center stage here and what results is the strongest piece of musical magic ever recorded.  This is definately one to play loud and with your eyes closed.  How Tuomas manages to write songs of this magnitude time and time again just amazes me.  Greatest songwriter of our time anyone? <br /> <br />Included on this edition are bonus tracks \\"White Night Fantasy\\" and \\"Live to Tell the Tale\\".  Both songs kick ass and fit in perfectly with the sound of the album.  The CD also includes the video to \\"wish I had an Angel\\".  It's a good video but personally I would've preferred the Nemo video to be on here.  That is a brilliant video, and is in fact the one Nightwish song that I had ever heard prior to buying this album.  Needless to say I've never looked back and progressive, operatic, symphonic or \\"whatever you want to call it\\" metal is now all I can listen to.  I used to live in the dark thinking bands like Metallica (classic), Coal Chamber(nu) or Dimmu Borgir(black) were all metal had to offer, but this album is so good it has ruined all other kinds of music for me.  I also recommend other prog-metal bands like Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Lacuna Coil etc.  I also can't wait to hear Epica and Leave's Eyes.  Reviews on Amazon make them sound really interesting and i will order them as soon as i can afford to. <br /> <br />This album also marks an important landmark since we now know that it will have been singer Tarja's last studio album with the band.  While this news is distressing, I can't wait to see who the new singer is and what the impact on the band's sound will be.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|A Beautiful Lie (ABL) is the second masterpiece after 30 Seconds To Mars's (30stm) first self-titled album. Each song is slightly different, yet similar enough to bring a sense of unity to the record. Head-banging hits like \\"Attack\\"  and \\"Battle of One\\" will get your blood pumping and ready to rock out, while others such as \\"The Story\\" are on the mellow side of rock with their dead-on lyrics that everyone can relate to.  I highly recommend this album, along with the self titled debut album.  If you find you enjoy the music check out 30stm's official website: [...] They are also about to begin their very first headlining tour titled Forever Night Never Day, so check their website for tourdates near you! Trust me, you want to see this band live- they are explosive and mind-blowing.  Shannon thrases around on the drums, Matt rocks out on his bass while Tomo bounces around on guitar. Meanwhile, Jared is running around on stage, crowd surfing, stage diving, running through the crowd and finding various things to climb.  Plus, after the show they always head over to the merchandise booth, so you are guaranteed to have at least your ticket signed and a chance to say hello.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Over the past few years, filmmakers have started making a lot more fantasy movies than in previous years, and I think that's thanks to Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. But MirrorMask captures another side of fantasy that isn't often in movies, and that is surrealism. Very little in this movie is explained, and in truth it doesn't need to be. The laws of the story are presented, and no matter how screwed up they are they are completely acceptable. And those responsible for this movie, Neil Gaimon and Dave McKean, have done this side of fantasy so well before (read Coraline), it's almost impossible for these two veterans to screw this one up.<br /><br />MirrorMask follows the journey of a young girl who's tired of her life in the circus run by her parents. In the opening moments, this girl, Helena, gets into a shouting match with her mother and though nothing comes of it in the end, Helena feels a deep responsibility when her mother suddenly collapses backstage during the circus festivities. Ridden with guilt and wanting nothing more than her mother to be okay, Helena wakes up in a strange world that isn't exactly unfamiliar to her. Once here, she discovers that a Queen is locked in a permanent sleep, and the only way to wake her is to find the Charm and the missing princess, who just so happens to look a lot like Helena. Opposing her is another Queen, this one of the shadows, who hunts Helena and her traveling companion Valentine throughout the dream-world Helena has found herself in.<br /><br />The movie has a number of magical moments worth mentioning. During her journey, Helena meets many magical creatures, including Sphinxes, giants, and some odd looking, penguin/gorilla creatures that highlights one of the most thrilling moments of the movie. All of these creatures, made with the help of the Jim Henson Company, are made alive with some excellent special effects and convincing characterizations. Giants are slow-talking creatures with infinite patience, while Sphinxes, in the vein of Oedipus, is a riddling creature who loves the taste of the printed page. But what's even more magical than the creatures is the settings. It seems that Dave McKean drew every separate background and flushed it out with 3D CGI. As the characters move through the world, you get a sense that they are walking along pages rather than streets, and that, I think, was the goal of the director. After that, there is a distinctly unique soundtrack that adds a lot to the wonder of this film.<br /><br />As for the DVD, while it doesn't have a lot of extra features, it has one that I personally loved, and that is the interview with Neil Gaimon, a favorite writer of mine. Beyond that, it has an interview with Dave McKean as well, along with a rundown of the history and the making of MirrorMask. Overall, this is a solid DVD.<br /><br />Though not a perfect movie, this movie should and probably will be remembered in later years as one of those magical films to come out of our time. The story, while not unique, is presented in a way that has never been done, in a setting that is eye-catching and sometimes a bit scary. The characters are lovable, the conflict tense enough, and there is even a minor twist that is built up by one of the character early on in the movie that will make you smile during the ending moments of MirrorMask. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy films like the Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland., while Sphinxes, in the vein of Oedipus, is a riddling creature who loves the taste of the printed page.

B00000373U|5.0|This album has a five-star average on Amazon (and iTunes), and considering how rare that is, this album really has to be commended.  I won't say too much because other reviews described his music well.  This is a poignant, haunting classic, buy it right now.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I really don't know what to say to this guy. Obviously, this man must live with his parents because he hasn't grown the motor skills needed to whipe his own feces off his backside. He mentioned that the members of Opeth aren't very talented musicians. Ok, then play a song off of Ghost Reveries. Go ahead, record yourself playing any complete song off of this album and then post it on here just so I know that you are honest in your statement that these guys are talentless hacks. Also, you said that these guys are horrible live. When and where did you see them play? It must've been some time ago because I saw them play a week ago in Cinncinati, Ohio. They didn't make any mistakes, and the music they were playing didn't seem very easy. Maybe we are talking about a different band. I'm talking about Opeth, quite possibly the best and most talented death metal band........ever. Ghost of Perdition, the first track off of this CD has enough riffs in it alone to satisfy most bands these days. But Opeth decides to give us seven more songs, all of which probably caused most bands to blush w/ envy. This is an amazing CD. I can't really say it's their best because that's an impossible call to make. But I will say that this is probably the best CD that a new fan can buy in order to introduce him/herself to Opeth, in it's true form. These guys are the total package. The guitars are perfectly synched. The riffs and solos are well played. Tapping, false harmonics, triplets, finger picking....its all here. There is a good lesson for guitar students in every song. The bassist is beyond amazing. He's Godlike. This guy is about 5'4\\" and he's a monster. He plays with all four fingers, and he is all over the neck. he plays the root, dances all over the melody, solos, and locks in with the rest of the band with ease. The drummer is no slouch either. He commands every piece of his set. This guy seems to have a separate brain for every limb. And the singer (who happens to also be the lead guitarist) is probably the most accomplished vocalist in music nowadays. His growls and screams are untouchable, yet he sings as well as the likes of the late Jeff Buckley. If you like heavy music, these guys need to be in your collection.  <br /> <br />I recommend this, and any other Opeth CD, to any fan of great metal. Honestly, if you are a fan of good music, and you aren't picky about styles, give these guys a listen too. They are head and shoulders beyond everyone else in the game. Oh yeah, they are pretty good live too.  <br /> <br />5 STARS
B00005BL2A|4.0|Some albums are perfectly fine, but for some reasons it gets maligned anyway. In some cases I can truly understand, but I don't honestly get what Depeche Mode fans don't like about \\"Exciter\\". It may not have the edginess that's being more in Recoil albums now, but it's just as good as most \\"classic\\" DM. Gahan's vocals are excellent even more here than \\"Ultra\\". \\"When the Body Speaks\\" and \\"The Dead of Night\\" are some of DM's greatest songs. The former is just plain beautiful and uses the instrumentation we know & love the band for, where \\"The Dead of Night\\" possibly the most edgy thing made from DM, with a classic industrial sound, which a couple beginning tracks on the new album sound like. Also take note of the first two tracks, as well as \\"I Feel Loved\\" and \\"Freelove\\", or even \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" which is really gorgeous. <br /> <br />Sure, the instrumental tracks aren't much of anything and there's a few DM albums I prefer, but this album doesn't suck by any definition, at least in my eyes. Mark Bell's production may not be as good as Flood's, but get serious people... NO ONE's really is.
0307276902|4.0|A Million Little Pieces was a very inspirational novel about drug addiction and the path to recovery. James Frey is at a pivotal point in his life and is forced to finally make some better choices for himself. James comes to terms with the fact that he's a serious drug addict and alcoholic and decides to make the conscious decision to quit. A Million Little Pieces shows us some of the struggles a recovering addict has to experience, as we watch through James' eyes.  <br /> Despite all the controversy, I felt that it did nothing to take away from the fact that this book was well written and had a great message. Granted, rather than call it an autobiography or memoir, he should have said, \\"based on true events;\\" but other than that, I though A Million Little Pieces was a great read and definitely worth my time and yours.  <br />          Sarah Williams  <br />
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you truly love The Beatles, or are just intrested in them, this DVD is for you. Told by all of The Beatles, with the exception of John (it does have some interview), it is a five disc dvd box-set that tells their story from when they began, to when the broke up. The footage used in it is awsome, and you get to learn cool little secrets. I also own the book version, but it is to complicated. This DVD makes everything 100 times better. Though it may take quite a few hours to get through it all, it is well worth it. Plus, because there are 2 episodes on each disc, except the last which is filled with special features, if want to skip a period, you can. I think this was a purchase that will treasure for the rest of my life.
B000001Y5D|2.0|I only liked one song on the CD - all others were just average.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|This film is utter nonsense; there is no novelty with the special effect as there was back in 1933 -  the 1933 movie is greatness personified ; the acting is poor and Jack Black made it feel like a stupid comedy instead of an adventure of even remotely epic pro portions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />If you like long movie u can go and buy it ...if you like good movie you can buy the 1933 version. <br /> <br /> <br />NOT RECOMMENDED <br /> <br /> <br />
B00007FOMP|5.0|If one were to draw a parallel between Marvin Gaye's What's Going On and a classical music work, something like the text painting out of Palestrina would come to mind.  What Mr. Gaye did in weaving his pristine multi-tracked vocals in and throughout this masterpiece is astounding!  The impact on me as a musician, upon hearing this album the entire way through was immeasurable.  When Simon Cowell stated &#34;What's Going On&#34; was one of the greatest songs of all time, he was right. In fact, it may be the greatest song of all time and the song and accompanying album the most ingenious compositional work of any genre period.  From the Coltrane like sax at the beginning to the improvisational vocal ad libs, to the socially conscious message of peace and civil rights, the astounding harmonic progression that obviously transcends anything The Beatle's did and some, the culmination of the multitracked vocalizations via harmonization that crystallizes the recapitulation and leads into the anthem of the final chorus and that fades into the sunset with the pedal bass in the effervescent coda, this album should be played in every public school, for every American and should be a part of every young American's education.  Whenever Congress disagrees, this album should be played, whenever negotiations are needed in the world, people ought to sit back and listen to this album in all its glory.
B00003CXAW|5.0|My first 5 was given for the brilliant special effects for the time this was done....anyone who gives this less than a 4 or five is rating it based on today's standard of CGI effects and that simply is not the way to rate a film like this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I have this in color and it's  highly recommemded.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It's The Beatle's Greatest Hits in chronological order on one CD... enough said
0783231202|5.0|This film is a truly great film.  It not only \\"tugs\\" at the heart strings but also gives one an insight into what the African people actually endured during the slaving period in history.  This is perhaps one of the films that schools need to show during Black History Month as well as any time during the year.  A definite story that needed to be told.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|This is actually a pretty funny movie. It is very similar to films like American Pie, Road Trip, and Harold and Kumar, but doesn't surpass the laughability of those films. This is a worthwhile film if you are up for some funny lines and physical gags.<br /><br />To get the full 'road trip' experience, I suggest you watch \\"Hostel\\" after \\"Eurotrip\\".
B0002TT0NW|4.0|harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban gives the audiences suspense and excitement...The movie and j.k rowling's novel improved from the sorcerer's stone down to the chamber of secrets...It gives viewers to crave for the next harrry potter series...Also it gives me an inspiration to create a story and a novel or even a movie quite (quite) similar to this... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />P.S. <br />I hope J.K rpwling will write again more harry potter novel's... <br />I really like this one...
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I'll admit...I hadn't ever heard Queens of the Stone Age before \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" came out, and I bought it mostly because of Dave Grohl.  But I knew I'd have to check out the follow-up to it, and as far as I'm concerned \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is the better album. <br /> <br />This is one of those weird records where I listened to it and got really into the first half of it, then kind of got bored and would turn it off.  Then, for whatever reason, I started to get really into the second half of the record, and wrote off the first half as radio-ready singles while the back side let Josh express himself more creatively.  After finally letting both halves (sides?  I miss vinyl...) of this thing finally duke it out in a no-holds-barred steel cage deathmatch, you know what?  I just like the whole thing.  \\"Medication,\\" \\"Everybody Knows That You Are Insane,\\" \\"In My Head,\\" \\"I Never Came,\\" \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" - all great.  In fact, my only complaint with any of the songs is that \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" is a little short...it could easily go another 2-3 minutes.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I was on a high for days after I watched this show. It is a profoundly moving, synergistic combination of music, acting and dance that has very little in common with traditional musicals as we know them. French musicals have always developed along a different path to the Broadway/West End tradition, and nowhere is it more evident than in the production of \\"Notre Dame de Paris\\".    Before getting into the production, a word about the story. This is slimmed down from Victor Hugo's original novel, but essentially faithful to the text. Even Hugo's major thesis, that the age of the cathedrals will be killed by modernity, is touched upon, although the emphasis is on the fear of the gypsies/foreigners. The only significant omission is the subplot with Esmeralda's mother: in this version, Esmeralda is indeed a gypsy, rather than a child stolen by the gypsies from her mother. The character is thus also altered somewhat from the book, although the essentials remain: she is a young woman who is as yet unaware of her own sensuality and finds herself the subject of the unwanted attentions of two men, while falling in love with a third. Helene Segara is peraps a trifle too deliberate in her flirting at the start, but she is stunning in the second act. Vocally, I prefer Noa's version on the cast recording, but this is a matter of taste.    The production itself is very modern, and very sophisticated. It is not a musical in the classical sense, although there are some elements of rock-operas like \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\". Here, the story and themes are expressed through movement (modern dance) as much as music, and some of the numbers that sound fairly repetitive on the recording (Les Sans-Papiers, for instance) come to life with the choreography, which is clearly the intent. In fact, I'm not sure that choreography and dancing are even the appropriate terms -- it really is more like expressionistic movement.    The staging is modernistic, austere and industrial in theme; allusionsare made, although never pounded in, to the plight of illegal immigrants in France and around the world. The costumes are very expressionistic as well, not exactly all-modern, more a mixture of what you'd expect to see (say, a priest's cassock) interpreted for the stage (Frollo's costume has strips of fabric on his sleeves that make him look like a bird of prey or an omninous death-without-his-scythe figure in silhoette; an image used very effectively).    The actors are remarkable, especially Daniel Lavoie as Frollo and Garou as Quasimodo. They use poses, gestures and hand movements to create character, sometimes very obviously and sometimes very subtly and it's extremely effective. The costuming is really not what transforms them, not even Quasimodo -- he somehow _becomes_ a deformed guy, you can completely believe it. Bruno Pelletier does not get to do quite as much acting as the poet-narrator Gringoire, but his vocal part is earth-shattering. (Listen out for his phenomenal encore after the titles, where he gets to show off a little bit without the backing music.) Julie Zenatti likewise shines in the small, but wonderfully rendered part of Fleur-de-Lys.    The final sequence, the execution, was just heart-rending. The stage is dark, and only a red light shines on Esmeralda as she dies. Then a light leaps across the facade of \\"Notre Dame\\" (actually a multi-purpose set built like a honeycomb of boxes) and the distraught Quasimodo sends Frollo tumbling from cell to cell through this honeycomb, in flashes of light. When Quasimodo puts Esmeralda on the ground and sings to her, shadowy dancers behind him carry their own broken girls, who float away and back, as if their souls were dancing in mid-air. It is beautiful and deeply moving.    Perhaps my only real compaint is the quality of the cinematorgraphy. The camera angles are choppy and intercut continuously, so that at times it is very difficult to get an overall impression of the stage as seen by the audience. Occasional moments of brilliance, such as the unexpected view of Esmeralda in her cell from the back of the stage, are offset by the jarring and too-frequent \\"special effects\\", along the lines of unnecessary freeze-frames at the end of every musical number and the occasional slo-mo sequence that is clearly out of place. However, I found I could get past that and just appreciate the production itself, and it was a wonderful experience. I only wish I could see this live!
B00004D3C1|5.0|A friend of mine got me into Fu Manchu, and I had previously bought \\"California Crossing,\\" and \\"The Action is Go.\\"  I finally got around to picking up \\"King of the Road,\\" which just blows the other two away.  Fu Manchu cranks out driving riff-heavy stoner rock for the guys that prefer Vans checkerboard slip-ons to Doc Martens.  Make sense?  Every song on here is all killer, no filler, but I gotta single out \\"King of the Road,\\" \\"Hell on Wheels,\\" \\"Boogie Van,\\" and \\"Drive.\\"
B00000DLV1|5.0|I love electronica, I like orchestral music. In this release they have the perfect union. Even my friends who have a hard time listening to electronic/ambient music really, really like this release. If you are a serious music aficionado you must own this. This is a stunning piece of work that will spin on and on in all types of players and in all kinds of places.

0887307280|5.0|... in a good way. <br /> <br />As a fledgling business owner, I had no idea of what I didn't know about owning a business.  Gerber's important business philosophy -- that not all entrepreneurs actually are -- was a wrecking ball to what I thought running a business was all about.  Thank goodness, because now I have a new foundation for building a business that will succeed. <br /> <br />This book gives business owners valuable insights such as: (1) The successful business must be designed to run independently of its owner (!); and (2) There are actually three personalities inside every business owner that he must learn to balance effectively.   <br /> <br />I considered subtracting a star for what I at first considered a malapropos esoteric, almost metaphysical bent to the author's style.  However, I realized he has done an excellent service by bringing an element of humanity (\\"spirit\\") to business that goes beyond just the bottom line.  (After all, only a human can run a business.) <br /> <br />Everyone who has started or is thinking of starting a business MUST read this book.  Your business will not be the same ... in a good way.
0761944524|5.0|Andy Field's second edition of Discovering Statistics Using SPSS improves on it's predecessor by adding a great deal of new information (e.g. effect sizes), without sacrificing the clever, conversational tone that made the first edition such a pleasure to read (yes, a statistics book can actually make for pleasurable reading).  This book is a great teaching aid and also a handy reference.  I highly recommend it for students and teachers who are interested in reviewing and expanding their knowledge of statistics.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I would love to have this DVD. I was like that when I was a teenager. I wasn't telepathley powered,but I was bugged by teenagers,too. I wish I could've gotten them,I also want to do some good with the powers,too.
0375703861|3.0|I think this is a great book to explore the themes from a cultural studies post-colonial perspective.  I liked it at times, but my English college students HATED it for a plethora of reasons folks already mentioned here. <br />One thing that BUGGED me was the over use of  <br />\\"it was a kind of past-tense, present-perfect moment...\\" <br />At first I loved that use of description as a teacher of writing, but the 3rd time I wanted to scream. <br /> <br />Otherwise, check it out!
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance is probably the most amazing band I've ever heard in my life. I remember the first time I heard \\"Helena\\"...I was watching TRL on MTV and their music video was in the number one spot. The song captivated me, and I was desperate to hear their album. I'd heard their song \\"I'm Not Okay\\" a while back, and I completely loved it, but I was so caught up with everything in my life I forgot all about them...but anyway, I had begged my mom to let me get the CD, but at first, she didn't approve since it had Parental Advisory on it...but she let me have it in the end. I couldn't stop listening to it at home. I had memorized every lyric on the third day I had it. I was so obsessed, and I still am! I can't wait for their upcoming album this summer! I also bought I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, and it was also amazing, but it couldn't compare to Three Cheers. MCR is just incredible. They've written some deeply moving and amazing lyrics, and the guitar solos will leave you mesmerized. I especially enjoy \\"The Ghost of You\\" and \\"Thank You For the Venom.\\" Gerard Way's voice is one of the best I've ever heard. If you haven't gotten their CD, or uploaded them onto your ipod from your computer, I suggest you do it NOW.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Wow, what a spectacular movie with a stellar cast.  This is such an engaging and addictive movie, its' only setback is its run-time, kinda long.  Also, Val Kilmer is a little weak, like he is in all his movies except for Real Genius.  He delivers a passable peformance in this movie only because he's surrounded by masters such as Pacino, DeNiro, and Siezmore.  Overall, it's a top-self movie that's elightening for everyone age 9 to 99.
B000077VR3|5.0|Don't expect anything subtle or refined from Moulin Rouge a full out assault on your eyes and heart!The film's hyperactive opening is offputting at first bur when the radiant Nicole Kidman enters the scene the movie really takes off.Strong performances by Ewan McGregor as a penniless writer in love and Nicole Kidman the object of everyone's affections create the emotional core of the movie.Director Baz Lurhman's creative visual energy creates the fireworks.From the fantasy sequence where Ewan woos Nicole with a medley of popular songs to a hilariously inventive rendition of Madonna's Like A Virgin Moulin Rouge is full of spetacular memorable scenes.This movie's highly stylized approach takes a lot of chances but thanks to the energy of the cast and vision of the director they all pay off.Moulin Rouge is a sensory overload masterpiece!
B000E97X66|5.0|What a masterpiece, hearing the band in their early years forming some of the classics we all have come to know. They sound tight, energized and like they're having fun. Big Fame and Fotrune were coming soon, but this is Bruce right at the cusp, and if you don't move to this, you may need to see if you have a pulse. What a great time it must have been to be there before the big stadium tours, etc. PLAY THIS LOUD!

0805047905|5.0|I taught kindergarten before my daughter was born, and a veteran teacher suggested using this book to help my students learn their colors.  I was amazed at how well it worked!  The children were so captivated by the flowing, rhyming text that they did not realize they were learning their colors!  What's more, they loved the book so much that they wanted to learn how to read, so they could read it by themselves or to younger siblings at home.  Even before my daughter was born, I bought a copy of this book for her.  We read it almost daily.  By the time she was 1 1/2, she could name the animals, recognize colors, and find the teacher at the back of the book!  I highly recommend this book to parents and educators.  It is a valuable addition to any library!
B000E1155E|2.0|a bit boring, really. <br />i don't see what all the hype is about at all. <br /> <br />i only gave it a two because it isnt, horrible, and there is *some* talent there. they just don't hold my attention in the slightest.
B00005JOWF|5.0|To start things off, seeing Milla in Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocolypse impressed me to no end. She's like a modern day Sigourney Weaver, showing her tough as nails passion in action/sci fi flicks and Ultraviolet is all Jovovich.     Similar to Matrix/Elektra/Aeon Flux style, the story is about the battle between humans and a new race with genetic mutation. Pretty cliche, but when you see how it's pulled off you'll adore it. The action is pretty good, with lots of shoot outs and swordfighting, more realistic and awesome seeing Milla with a sword than let's say- Uma Thurman. Oh and when you see the way she carries all those weapons with her, you're gonna say \\"that's freaking clever!\\" The CGI cities and effects are pretty good, but there are scenes where it's overdone. Sure there's more action than story, but this type of Jovovich movie gets people ready for the next Resident Evil.     Since Resident Evil, Milla never let her crowd down. She's one of the best female action stars in history and hope she continues her beat down on the big screen in the near future. This chick has a future ahead of her.
B00005UW9T|2.0|That's the best way I can describe this film. Don Bluth created 2 films that I absolutely loved as a kid: An American Tail and Land Before Time(I still quote that \\"mother, what's a looooong neck?\\" line). So watching Anastasia you think, ooh, another one. Just too bad that's not the case since not only did they mess around a bit with history but it just smacks of trying to outdo Disney instead of just telling a good story. <br /> <br />The film centers around Anastasia who escapes a siege in her castle. She loses her memory and becomes Anya and meets Dimitri, the grown up boy who saved her from the castle. He's been training would-be Anastasia's to collect prize money but he finds the real one and has to travel to Paris from Russia to reunite her with her grandmother. <br /> <br />One of the most infamous mysteries in history, let alone Russian history, is what happened to Anastasia, the daughter of Czar Nicholas the 2nd. During the Revolution, Anastasia supposedly escaped and details are wild saying she was bayoneted many times, others say she went to Germany and became Anna Anderson which turned out to be false. The film says that not only did Anastasia survive but actually made it to Paris and all was well. <br /> <br />It's a very interesting story with many ways to go about it but this is quite something. Unlike other films which takes creative liberties to make a better story/pacing, this film throws history out the window entirely. Not to fault the film for wanting to tell a fuller story but it's practically rewriting history. For starters, Rasputin didn't start the Revolution, Lenin did. And Rasputin was actually assasinated way before it began. <br /> <br />What made other animated films that had musical numbers was that they were catchy. Here they seem kind of a hindrance, there's literally a moment where not even 2 minutes pass and we're \\"treated\\" to another song. It would be ok if they were memorable but I can't remember anything about them at this point.<br /> <br />One thing that I can't fault the film on is the animation and voice acting. The animation for the most part works, especially backgrounds. Never did like the character designs though since they look kind of ugly, especially Anastasia. The voice acting is quite top notch though featuring Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar and Christopher Lloyd as well as Hank Azaria. <br /> <br />If you want notable Bluth films, watch American Tail and Land Before Time but if you want check this film out too but I didn't enjoy it as much.

Enjoy the concert again with all of it's great music and energy in disk 1 then enjoy in disk 2 the true labor of love of making this event happen and step into a greater awareness of the extraordinary man that George was not only as a great musician and songwriter but also as a caring soul who dared to pioneer such an event that had such a noble purpose. Thanks George. And thanks to Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan...the list goes on! What an important event in history and in music. A timeless masterpiece.
B00005JL0U|5.0|We have been waiting and waiting and waiting to get Michael Jackson's Moonwalker on DVD in the U.S.  Everyone else has it, but we don't.  It is now 2006, and one of the best movies is not on DVD.  People have been writing reviews for a long time and no one has done anything about this.  I personally don't have a copy of Moonwalker at all, so I would really love to get my first copy of it on DVD.  Please, if you all have hearts, make Michael Jackson's Moonwalker available on a Region 1 DVD.
0553801503|4.0|Whatever one might say, the truth is that you put down this book unfulfilled. I grasped for more in this novel, i kept wanting 'something' from it that it just wouldnt give. All three of Martin's previous novels worked well because even though they could be read like a trilogy of sorts, they still felt like separate complete stories. Here, in Feast, im kindadisappointed.  <br /> <br />It is not because Martin cannot write. Martin is an amazing writer and every chapter, every sentence is virtually perfect. Martin writes with such grace and beauty that he could literally write about rocks and grass and it would be great. His prose is as good as anything in Books 1-3. But the problem is that we have gotten so used to amazing plotlines with Martin, and this is were the book flounders.  <br /> <br />The backstory if you dont know is thus: Martin wrote such a huge book for this fourth addition that his editors wouldnt publish it  unless he split the book in two. So the book was chopped in half; not like part 1 and part 2, but by POVs. This book covered (half?) the POVs (namely Jaime, Arya, Sansa, Samwell), two new POV characters (Brienne and Cersei) and two multiple thread storylines (one concerning the Greyjoys, another concerning events in Dorne). Who is missing? Catelyn (who 'died' in the last novel) and also Jon Snow, Tyrion, Bran, Davos, and Daenerys. Does the absence of these POV character change the power and enjoyment of the storyline? YES YES YES!!! <br /> <br />The first problem with his format is that the splitting of the characters into two groups was just not done equally. Honestly the powerhouse characters who pull the storyline forward are Tyrion, Daenerys, Arya, Jon Snow, and Jaime  (...okay maybe Sansa). But in Feast Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon Snow are missing, the always compelling Arya is reduced to a measily four chapters of a well-written but not exactly amazing plotline, (Sansa faces the exact same problem as Arya) and Jaime (while being one of the dominant POV-chapter characters), is also left in a certain, well, meandering plotline --that is pleasurable to read but not grasping.  <br /> <br />The second problem here is that the largest POVs are for NEW characters, Cersei and Brienne. You would think that Martin would be gradually introducing these new characters while keeping his past main characters still on stage, but everyone else seems to sort of fall on the wayside in place of Brienne and Cersei. Cersei dominates the storyline with a plot that is highly interesting and fun to read, but you often feel like every other chapter or so you are reading a 'Cersei chapter' and it begins to feel like you reading things that arent that topical to the central plot, or at least you could comprehend that said pages would be better spent with developing Arya or Sansa. Even more frustrating is the Brienne storyline. As ive said, Martin is a great writer, and though i sometimes would roll my eyes whenever i saw ANOTHER Brienne chapter, i would end the chapter saying 'wow, Martin really can write'. But the fact is, in the grand scheme of things, i seriously feel that the entire Brienne storyline could be completely dropped from the series as a whole, as it truly seems to have absolutely no effect at all. For while Theon's POV only lasted one book (book 2), his takeover of Winterfell was completely relevant to the central storyline.  <br /> <br />The third problem concerns the remaining storylines. Samwell is, has been, and i feel always will be DULL. Though Sam bored me in Book 3, i had high hopes for him in this book, as his storyline was taking him through such fabulous places as Braavos and Oldtown. Unfortunately, i was still bored. The other two POVs were those of the multiple storylines. The first concerned the Greyjoys, and was split among three of them (Aeron/Damphair, Asha, and Victarion). The second concerned events in Dorne, and was split among 4 characters (Arianne Martell, Prince Doran Martell, Ser Arys Oakheart, and Areo Hotah --a Dornish guard). These two multiple thread storylines were indeed excellent and some of the most interesting and relevant plotlines in the entire book. However, each would have done much better solidified into one POV (For the Greyjoys --- Victarion, for the Dornish ---Arianne Martell). All these characters are as fleshed out as can be in their measily, stand-alone chapters, but just cant stand up to the other main character POVS. Perhaps this is the point though, as Martin may end all their storylines by the end of the next book.   <br /> <br />All in all this IS great writing, but still feels like a bunch of separate chapters thrown together in one giant pile, with no real cohesion, and desperately lacking its more exciting cousin POVs. To make matters even less compelling, the central plot has reached its own lull, as the war (at least as far as the Starks vs Lannisters go) is OVER, and the the book settles into a quiet, more relaxed pace, as if everyone has turned over a new leaf, and is starting another climb up the ladder. There are no Red Weddings, no shocking truths uncovered (i.e. the true murderer of Jon Arryn), no truly memorable falls or rises (the death of Catelyn, the raising of Jon Snow to Lord Commander). However this book remains a worthy and very necessary read. Don't shoot it down, but don't expect to be blown away either.
0385513755|5.0|Dan Brown brilliantly weaves research, science, religion, politics, history.... and puts it all together with mystery.  You will be held from the first couple of pages til you put it down.  I will not go into detail about the book, others already have; all you need to know is - this book is a must-read.  If you limit yourself to only a couple of books that you read, this must be one of them.
B00006ADFL|5.0|an indie film well made, sharply written and directed.  the acting from both leads is extremely exceptional.  \\"creatures\\" visual effects are stunning!!!  surpasses the highly forgettable L.O.T.R. trilogy.  \\"HEAVENLY CREATURES\\" IS PETER JACKSON'S BEST MOVIE!!
B000002KOG|5.0|No Neil Young collection could ever be worthwhile without this, his first solo recording.  Neil has ventured into so many disparate genres that it is hard to keep track of his many contributions to music, even for those with the most eclectic of tastes.  One might ask, \\"Does anyone possess a 'complete' collection of his recordings?\\"<br />So even if no colection could ever be complete, no collection should ever be without this gem.  From the first electric solo note of \\"The Emperor of Wyoming\\" one can hear the evidence of Neil's true originality, and intimations of his greatness and his genius.  Has any sound ever suggested the open space of the North American prairies with greater subtlety and exhilaration?

0440241588|1.0|This is not one of Grisham's best. The book starts off well with an intriguing premise, but plateau's early. Story line gets tedious with chapter after chapter focused on the character learning the Italian language/culture while looking over his shoulder. At some point you'll want to say, \\"OK, I get it already...he's on the run in a foreign country.\\" The central character is neither interesting nor likeable--which makes it hard to root for him. Actually none of the characters are particularly likeable, and they have very little depth. The ending is not particularly rewarding and the resolution is much too easy. Much of the details of the plot are left unexplained by the end of the book. Overall, disappointing.

006056251X|4.0|I haven't read any of the previous books in this series, so I cannot say whether or not \\"Devil in Winter\\" stands up well to the previous installments, or if it fails to compare. What I can say though was that I did find it to be a compelling read -- to see how this relationship between the proper and conventional Evangeline and the improper and rakish Sebastian would fare was pretty much the driving force behind this book, <br />and what a driving force it was too! <br /> <br />With her notorious father near death (Ivo Jenner owns and runs a gambling club), Evangeline realises that she has to escape from her cruel and grasping relatives (whom she has been living with these past few years while they shepherded her through the London season), especially since they have plans to marry her off to her oafish cousin in order to gain control of her fortune. Evangeline has no intention of continuing to live with the very people who have been abusing her, much less give them full access to her inheritance. And so she conceives of a daring plan: to offer herself as a bride to the penniless and rakish Sebastian, Viscount St. Vincent. After all, if he was willing to kidnap and forcibly try to marry one heiress (her good friend Lillian Bowman) because of his sorry financial state, surely he'd be willing to chance things with a willing heiress? HOwever, even though Evangeline thought that she had planned for all contingencies, she hadn't planned on her attraction to the dreadful man -- or on his for her. And now, she must decide if she's willing to allow her vulnerable heart to be swept away by a rakish rogue like Sebastian... <br /> <br />If you're looking for a sensual read, look no further: \\"Devil in Winter\\" delivers and in spades! The book is well written and from a romance point of view, satisfying. After all who doesn't enjoy reading about a hopless and careless rake falling for his proper and conventional wife? But that was also part of my problem with this book: even while I was enjoying Sebastian's sudden obsession with his wife, I didn't really think Lisa Kleypas had made a good enough case (for me anyway) as to why he would have suddenly fallen for her (and I don't think his appreciation of her freckles was the answer either). That, however, was my only quibble with the book. I liked how the story unfolded, how the author fitted in the other \\"wallflowers\\" into this story (especially Lillian), and how Evangeline finally makes her husband see sense. However, even though this was Evangeline's story, what made this book standout was watching how Sebastian metamorphosed from a cold, sarcastic care-for-naught, into a caring gentleman with a new purpose in life and who had, unexpectedly, fallen in love with his demure and conventional wife. And that is what made this book a 4 star read. Very satisfying. <br />
B0000CAXIC|5.0|I was a true Foo Fighter's fan. Ok, I didn't do more than listening to their music, but I was a non-concert-going fan. That was before I listened to anything other than your average tv music channel music. During this period, I bought TCATS and loved every bit of it, just as I did with every other FF album that came out.    Now, a couple of years later, I know better. All those albums are not of that same quality I thought they were. Yet, after listening to TCATS again, it IS a wonderful piece of work. It's the only album of FF I would rate above 3.5 stars, and for a reason.    Try comparing all the albums. All of them miss the close to inteligent vibe which surrounds this album. Take \\"My Hero\\". Take \\"Everlong\\". Take \\"Monkey Wrench\\". Ok, I've picked the pure rocksongs. Take \\"My Poor Brain\\". I'll never forget the giant feeling of satisfaction I felt the first time the raw guitar noise at the start turned into the melodic riff supported by the air-like vocals of Grohl. As with most great albums, TCATS outclasses many others by having each song complement another. It's a whole, with variaty that lets you breathe for a second before going into the atmosphere of another class rock song.    This record stands far above anything FF made, it's like it's from a complete different band, a band who can make more out of a couple of notes. It's that intelligence that let the songs rise above a certain level. It's that bit that make the songs more than your average riff followed by a hook. It's that aspect that is lost in the other albums, it's that tiny thing that makes the big difference between 'ok' and 'wow, let me listen again'. If you were to own one FF album, you know what to do.
1400076943|2.0|As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very \\"surface level\\" with me, reads almost like a \\"young adult\\" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.
B000059MEK|5.0|This is a classic example of an album which is more than the sum of it's parts (read: tracks). Listening to Discovery is a journey, an atmospheric one. A little cheesy maybe, but it doesn't spoil the fun with this one. From the opening \\"One More Time\\" to the 10 minute during \\"Too Long\\", I can't stop myself to run to the stereo again and pressing play once more to take it all in. Ok, honestly, I'm not that into \\"Veridis Quo\\", yet it's of enough quality to not have me skip it. That said, any other track is outstanding, unique, and is filled with moments where you can tell Daft Punk have had a blast creating it. You can feel the joy and energy, and that is what seperates good albums from bad ones.    As I said, I pretty much adore every single track, but the highlight of the album must be whenever Discovery reaches track number 10 \\"Voyager\\". It sums an immense intensity of emotion, capturing the entire journey of the album in an 3,47 minute during fantasy. This song does something to me, something no other song has ever done.    Another thing I like my albums, is diversity of tracks. And Discovery got that with loads. Although some tracks tend to look a like, the complete package is best summed up as a joyfull rollercoaster, reaching highpoints of happyness and dancing joy, followed by moments of slower, yet highly melodical points of sadness.    Sure, if you're a high demanding listener who can criticize every single drum when listening with full attention, you may find the cheesy-ness disturbing. Yet, it doesn't deserve the low ratings I've seen flying around everywhere (not just here). It must not be compared with their debut Homework, which was packed with one after another moments of pumping beats. Discovery is here to please us in a completely different aspect. Lay down, close your eyes, and experience the journey which is called (clearly for a reason) Discovery. You'll memorize it as one of the best journey's till date.

0684824906|4.0|Salmon Chase knew he had a silly name, and he was embarrassed by it, because he thought himself destined to be president of the United States. <br /> <br />He considered changing his name and came up with \\"Spencer de Chaucey,\\" which, if possible, was worse than \\"Salmon Chase.\\" That says a good deal about why Chase never got to be president, despite his tremendous intellectual gifts, self-discipline and high moral sensibility. He had a tone-deaf awkwardness around his fellow men. <br /> <br />That's one of the tidbits you learn in \\"Team of Rivals,\\" Doris Kearns Goodwin's latest book, a narrative about Abraham Lincoln and four key members of his presidential cabinet he assembled in 1861, three of whom had been his rivals in seeking the Republican nomination just a few months before. <br /> <br />Most of the book's first third consists of the entwined parallel political biographies of Lincoln, Chase and William Seward. Edwin Stanton enters the book later, and by a different route. Edward Bates' appearance is patchy, since he spent most of the crucial pre-war years in cheerful domestic retirement with his wife and 17 children until the crisis of 1860 lured him back into politics. <br /> <br />Their stories are the stories of the times; political men of the North and border states who gravitate from the center into the radical Republican party under the pressure of a fracturing national political system.  <br /> <br />The 1860 Republican nomination was supposed to be Seward's coronation. But he had made too many enemies on his ascent to the throne. Chase, too, expected the nomination as a just reward for a lifetime of devotion to the causes that formed the Republican platform. In this clash of titans, Lincoln played the game of being the modest candidate who would be every delegate's second choice. Then he waited for the plot to spin out. <br /> <br />Chase and Seward had burning ambitions to be president, while Lincoln had an ambition to be great among his fellow men. <br /> <br />The best quality of this book is the wealth of material Goodwin gathers on the lives of the four cabinet members, most of which will be new even to readers roughly familiar with 19th century American history. This richness renders the long blanks in Lincoln's history all the more stark. There's little new here on Lincoln himself, because the thin file that exists on his background has been hashed and re-hashed for decades. <br /> <br />After the imbroglio of the wild 1860 election, however, the book settles down into a conventional history of the Northern government during the Civil War. The \\"rivals\\" become less important, except as mirrors to reflect Lincoln as he grapples with the war. <br /> <br />Still, it's like seeing a familiar scene from a different perspective. There is a well-known daguerreotype of Lincoln's inaugural, taken from out in the crowd, looking up the Capitol steps. This book feels like seeing the same scene from the seats behind the new president, looking out past his shoulders. <br /> <br />Goodwin's starry-eyed Lincoln biography grows whiggish. If some crisis erupts and Lincoln does nothing, then his masterly inactivity proves his genius. If some crisis erupts and he makes a sudden change, then the bold stroke proves his genius. <br /> <br />Goodwin swallows whole Lincoln's assertion that he read instinctively the temper of the Northern people, and took no step, however necessary, before he felt the public was mentally prepared for it. This, too, of course, she considers evidence of his genius. <br /> <br />But as it is impossible to rewind the tape of history and do it another way, no one, including Goodwin, knows if Lincoln was right or not. Certainly the violent explosion of resistance to the military draft suggests Lincoln sometimes read the people poorly. But that whole affair is passed over in a few paragraphs in Goodwin's book, even though conscription was as contentious in 1862 as emancipation, to which Goodwin devotes many pages. <br /> <br />There come points where even a staunch apologist like Goodwin can't justify Lincoln's appalling transgressions of basic American rights. Then she turns to the shabby lawyer's trick of abusing the plaintiffs. Everyone opposed to the administration is a traitor, or a drunk, or both. <br /> <br />Southerners, needless, to say, come off uniformly evil in this book, a grossly deformed race of \\"slaveocrats.\\" All Constitutional scruples by Southern men are swept aside, and all their words and deeds written off as the product of a love of slavery. The murderous John Brown here is a mere \\"abolitionist,\\" more muddled in his tactics than wrong in his aims, while it's the Southern reaction to him that is \\"zealous.\\" <br /> <br />Still, there are revelations. I have spent much of the past five years researching and writing on the woefully understudied topic of slavery in the Northern states, but not until I read this book did I realize that Seward himself was raised in a New York slaveowning family. <br /> <br />Goodwin also is excellent in writing on the role of wives (and in some cases daughters or others who stood in as surrogates) in political life. <br /> <br />She deals ably with the topic of the warmth of male friendships in \\"an era when close male friendships, accompanied by open expressions of affection and passion, were familiar and socially acceptable.\\" <br /> <br />How amusing that the Victorians can shock us prudish modern folk with the image of American men sharing beds, walking arm-in-arm, and writing frankly to one another of love and jealousy. Overheated modern imaginations conjure up rumors of homosexuality out of this material. <br /> <br />Instead, Goodwin dismisses all this nonsense and sanely quotes a modern historian of the period, to the effect that this \\"preoccupation with elemental sex\\" reveals more about us and our times than about them and theirs. <br /> <br />Goodwin is a competent prose stylist. If she never writes a line that sticks in the memory, she never writes the sort of grammatical train wreck sentences historians seem prone to producing. <br /> <br />Yet through all her black-and-white vision of the Civil War, Goodwin's Lincoln emerges from this book with his famous mercy for Southerners intact. And it is Chase, the least attractive figure in the book, who is the most strident abolitionist. Had she thought more about that, Goodwin might even have made a better book than this one, though this one is good enough.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|there aren't that many great movies being made and when i saw this movie i was really impressed.  each scene seems to be thoughtfully and carefully chosen to unveil the plot, the love, and transformation that love is capable of.  acting is phenomenal as you might expect from ray fiennes and rachel weisz.  to my delight, the acting is new and fresh.  i got the feeling that i had never seen the actor/actress in any other films except this one.  i've been in tanzania and so i am familiar with africa.  this movie captures africa in its beauty.  i wish the movie had more personal interactions with africans.  the africans are pretty much portrayed as \\"the other.\\"  although the heroine of the movie walks with africans and goes to the hopsital africans go to, somehow i wish the movie could have shown an even more personal connection that is possible between people regardless of one's cultural background.  the movie shows how one person can make a difference, if not for the world, then for one person, here and now.  the love between the two people was special and powerful.  the story of love told in this movie is not just another love story.  it is the story of love of two particular people.  i bought the dvd so i can watch it again and again and experience their passion for life.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is best described as a combination of a western and a sci-fi series set on the Millenium Falcon. Only it's far better than that. Firefly is decidedly one of the best television shows ever to hit the air, but Fox decided it was too intelligent and highbrow for their audience and never gave it a chance, which is why this DVD set is so valuable. Several of the episodes never aired on television, and the pilot itself which introduces the characters was never shown until long after the series was cancelled. <br /> <br />The characters, as developed by the actors, writers, producers and directors, are some of the most honest and real and fascinating characters ever developed for television or film. The depth of these characters and their complex interactions with one another is what grounds the sci-fi fantasy series so well to make it such a strong show.  <br /> <br />Even if you're not a fan of sci-fi or westerns, I'd highly reccommend you give this one a chance - watch the first 3 episodes and if you're not hooked, then I don't know what to tell you.

6305949980|4.0|Okay, first of all, if you haven't been living in a cave for the last 10 years, you know that TNBC has been a mainstay to HotTopic customers and poser-goths for years.  This review is not for those people.<br /><br />I will admit that I really enjoy this movie, but I had some problems with this presentation.  First of all is image quality.  It seemed to me like this was a burn to disk from someones well worn VHS tape.  I don't have a fancy-schmancy HDTV or anything, just an old fashion 32\\" tube TV, and this still seemed a bit fuzzy at times, especially the special features and extras.<br /><br />However, my biggest beef is with the sound.  The balance for 5.1 is just . . . Off.  The back ground music was way to loud in comparison to the whispers of full screen characters trying to talk to me through the center channel.  Furthermore, I had to turn the volume up significantly because the audio track as a whole was so quiet.  When I turned back to regular TV I nearly blew speakers.<br /><br />So, in the end.  TNBC is a great movie, and most who will buy this likely have already.  If you're actually thinking about purchasing for the first time, I'd wait if I were you.  I mean, it's been years and years since this movie was first released, if you wait that long again there's sure to be a new remix/mastered edition on the shelves.  Probably the same edition I'll buy like I have so many others.<br /><br />On a final note, the aspect ratio of this film is so close that of a standard TV that I at first thought somebody had slipped me a fullscreen version by accident.  However, upon turning all the lights off in the room I could see the feint bars at the top and bottom.  No biggie, all the action is center screen anyway, maybe it was cheaper to film at 1:1.6 instead of something grander.

This is good television (from a guy who never watches ANY).  The show is a juxtaposition of cultures, genres, and approaches to \\"film\\"making - and a step in the right direction for Science Fiction.  Instead of focusing on whatever technology and strange creatures the writers can dream up, this story is about people, and the cast has a chemistry that makes a it wonderful bunch to follow.  It's a shame there were only ever 14 episodes... now I'll have to watch Serenity to tie up the loose ends.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|There is no question of whether this is a 'good' album or not. It is technically excellent in all facets, from the power of the lead singer's voices, the poignancy, beauty, and power of the lyrics, and the incredible mix of orchestra, chorus, and a five-or-six member metal band. In terms of objective musical standards, this album is flawless. <br /> <br />Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it's to everyone's taste. If you enjoyed Metallica's performance with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, you will probably love this entire album. If you preferred Metallica without the orchestra, you'll like half of the album. And if, like me, you had never listened to Metallica prior to their performance with the orchestra, then you'll like the other half of the album. <br /> <br />\\"Nemo\\" was the song that sucked me in to this CD, and it's the only one that's gotten radio play in the US. I love the build from the piano in the beginning to the orchestra at the end, the lyrics are lovely, and the lead singer is (was, sadly) just incredible. <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Love Score\\" is just a masterpiece for anyone that like big choirs, pounding drums, and an orchestra that covers the whole gamut, from soft and sweet to enormous and soaring. Again, the lead singer shines. The best word for this song is \\"sweeping.\\" I loved every minute. <br /> <br />\\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\" will most likely not appeal to anyone who prefers heavy metal, but I'm a fan of Celtic and classical music, and the cello, the violins, and the flute in this song were just indescribably beautiful. I don't know what the lyrics translate to, and I don't want to. On an album like this, this song serves to round out the full range of their ability: Nightwish can do metal, they can throw a little electronica in there, and even some Native American woodwinds and drums, but in addition to all that they can play so softly and sweetly that's it's almost enough to bring tears to your eyes. This song is incredible. <br /> <br/>And, for something completely different, \\"Creek Mary's Blood.\\" It's politically interesting to see what a Finnish rock band makes of Native Americans, but the song itself is powerful and the Native American undercurrents and instruments are correctly and effectively inserted. I love the chorus on this song. Again, it's an expression of Nightwish's range, if nothing more. <br /> <br />All that said, it's pretty pointless to declare that a band \\"sucks\\" unless they're musically incompetent, because music more than almost anything else is a matter of personal preference. Nightwish is beyond competent into incredible talent, and if this mixture of genres is something you generally enjoy, you will love this CD.

B0009I7NNA|3.0|\\"City Of Evil\\" is simply a big change, for A7X ... they go from being an awesome modern thrash band with two great release \\"Waking The Fallen\\" and \\"Sounding Of The Seventh Trumpet\\",...to a totally different ablum...that is more of a regular rock with touches of emo vocal wise. Shadow had voice complications which prevented him from doing the more agressive vocals for the band, so they ripped up the old blue print and tried something totally new.  <br /> <br /> I was hearing alot of bad talk about this ablum when it first came out from some of my buds... being big time metal fans from myself...so I kinda waited on buying it for awhile, just to see how it turns out. I one day,, was flicking through the channels on my way to Comedy Central and I saw Avenged Sevenfold on MTV with their music video \\"Bat Country\\" and I was like holy f**** it was hard to believe that a metal band would find their way on a biased station like MTV which only shows pop rock, pop, rap, and punk/emo like music. I was also suprised by their new sound isn't wan't half bad...yeah the vocals at times were a bit emoish at the chorus, but beyond that the drumming, and the duo solo were awesome. <br /> <br /> Man, these guys sure know how to use their guitars I said to myself. I had thoughts of now buying the CD seeing them in action. So, I ended up picking it up a month later, and I gave it a spin. The ablum didn't sound half bad...I mean the songs were lower key than the original A7X, but they still rocked. I mean the guitar work is virtually amazing duo guitar solos..the works, and the drumming as well. The bass playing on the song \\"Sidewinder\\" was amazing. The only thing that brought the ablum down was the emoish whiney vocals...hey I don't mind emo but really Shadows sometimes got to carried away. Most of the songs were solid a few fillers. <br /> <br />I'm not going to bother to rate all the tracks so, in general the highlights include: <br /> <br />\\"Bat Country\\" <br />\\"Beast And The Harlot\\" <br />\\"Sidewinder\\" <br />\\"Burn It Down\\" <br />\\"Wicked End\\" <br /> <br />...and the rest are good as well. If you like rock, and are a metal fan thats not to picky you can check it out... but old school A7x fans beware, this is a whole different band. If they have a next ablum they should touch up the vocals and maybe try to make some more heavier tracks, but instrument wise keep doing what you're doing. <br /> <br />Good, but not great...3/5 <br />
B00000K31Q|5.0|I love this movie. It was a Valentine's Day present for my fiancee. He loved it, too.
B000000W5L|5.0|Rock and roll is almost impossible to describe. It's stretched out through 50 years of changes and new faces. Ecile on Mainstreet captures the entire lifespan of Rock and Roll. Blues, Country, Folf, Rock, it's all here. This is what the Rolling Stones are all about. It's a Keith Richards album, chock full of tracks that weren't (...)out in the studio. It's the only album I've ever reviewed on Amazon, and there's a reason why. It's the best of the best.
0553381407|5.0|Toxic Parents was one of the most helpful books I've read thus far in trying to unravel the mystery that is my relationship with my parents.  I am a successful professional, yet why do I feel this sense of not accomplishing my goals?  Why do relationships leave me empty?  How do I explain the weird patterns that are my life?  This book was truly enlightening and for me was the first step on a long road toward healing.

B000051YEG|5.0|Serge Gainsbourg could not have foreseen the timeless influence this soundtrack to a movie would have on the future of (groovy) music. In the last stages of the 20th Century contemporaries such as Air and Beck would infuse their music with the same sense of cool, swagger and groove into their own product. Gainsbourg is renowned for being critical in introducing classical elements to rock/pop. Although this wasn't strictly the case (The Beatles, Phil Spector and Brian Wilson were doing it in the mid 60s), Gainsbourg's particular take on it is distinctive and is immediately recognisable in the music of the above-mentioned contmporary artists. In other words if you love Air and Beck's Sea Change album, you MUST own this.
0783225849|5.0|In this disturbing thriller, Marion Crane has stolen $400,000 in cash and fled her hometown. She drives for days, and on the second night, she makes a mistake that she will pay with her life: she stops at the Bates Motel. There she meets the disturbed Norman Bates, who is living with his mother. Pan in to Marion's room. She is enjoying a shower when all of a sudden, a lady who we suppose is Norman's mother yanks open the curtain and stabs her to death. The rest is steller acting and a superb story. Definitely a must-see.

B000301YY8|4.0|James Blunt brings a unique and haunting sound to his album Back to Bedlam.  With his unique voice and choice of lyrics it makes an interesting addition to anyones collection of contemporary music.  I like this album because it has such a different sound than any currently played tunes on radio.  Great lyrics, but if you will be listening to this album with children in the room be sure to order the version rated G.
B000AU1NYW|5.0|I bought the US release of PTA when it came out last fall and found out about the Japanese import which has the bonus track \\"Free\\" on it a little later. I've heard it was also icluded as one of the b-sides to the UK release of the \\"Precious\\" single and been hearing good things about the song from the DM site etc so i was curious of how it was. and waddya know ? my GF gets the jap-import for me for X-mas. now, i must say Playing The Angel is an awesome album on its own, im proud to say that, DM really has never put out a bad album. Some ppl say they didnt feel Exciter too much but i think they are just thrown off by so much down tempo songs on it. it didnt really bother me cuz it was so different than whatever theyve done before and like all DM albums had few instant classics. Now, back to PTA. i gotta say ALL songs are really good with some that stand out more than others. If i can compare it to any of their prior albums, it would probabaly be a cross between Violator & Ultra, i know some would call that an overstatement, but time will tell. The final/bonus track on this import, \\"Free\\" is just perfect, since the album ends with a slow electronic ballad \\"The Darkest Star\\" you kinda feel a bit drained, then \\"Free\\" comes on and your up again ready to move ! Depeche Mode has done it again with PTA and i'll be seeing them @ Coachella in April.
B000059LGC|5.0|Many reviewers have talked about the good cast and their work in this movie, but I didn't find reviewers evaluating the soundness of the movie's argument. Either people did not seem to pay attention to the way the movie's assassinations were solved or they simply took it as it was without complains or contradicting the movie; this is impressive. I've seen several other reviews and Agatha's novel movies are the first products I found without much objections (if any at all). I also like very much all the cast's performances, but I got much more interested in the movie's logic.  <br /> <br />Then, I repeated the movie's end and some other scenes a few times to look for incongruence or flawed reasoning, it was fun. Besides I wasn't quite satisfied with the case explanation and I wanted to imagine how another one of the several murder suspects could still have done the crimes. However, the hero's (detective Hercule Poirot) logics to discover the bad guys stood to reason all along. It was rather the Poirot's assumptions about the suspects that were far out. For example, Poirot regarded one man (the Marxist) as a suspect just because he had been dishing out the killed victim. Poirot's basic idea to point anybody as a suspect was that a person could kill at the immediate chance of having a gun and nobody watching. Fortunately, most people don't kill that easily. Just look at a nation with gun rights like USA, which is relatively peaceful; despite so many news on crime this nation, it would be giant cemetery if people behaved as Poirot regards humans. <br /> <br />Thus that was the characteristic off in the movie, people are assumed to behave in more violent ways than they really do and the real bad guys' plans are way too far out. Nonetheless, this same characteristic makes the movie even more interesting to watch, because everybody could be a waco over there but logics stands still and help solve the case. <br /> <br />By the way, although most people have enjoyed this movie some stated that the former Agatha's movie (Murder in the Orient Express) was better. They didn't say quite clear why such preference but I guess it simply because two of the movie's characters (Poirot and the Doctor) spoke too many words in their mother tongues, French and German. I suggest you not to pay attention to those picky details, this movie was better than the Orient Express. This movie had fair jokes, much more light, several pretty and interesting scenarios in Egypt, a boat and England; the characters were less creepy and Poirot was able to prove his theory. The other movie (Orient's) is totally the opposite, everything takes place in dark scenarios within only a train (it was a saddening scenario despite being all luxury) and Poirot's case resolution was more awesome than at Nile's but could not provide real evidences. Yes, this movie was better. Just consider that virtually nobody is paying attention to the  movie's logics (as they do in the other one) but rather to the scenario and cast.
B00005JMCN|5.0|great movie <br />very inspirational <br />it's very touching at the end when both Seabiscuit and Red come through and win.
0307276902|4.0|I read this book after James Frey was confronted about not being 100% honest in this book.  I went in knowing that it wasn't all true and just read the book as fiction.  That said, it was still a powerful book that made me feel pain, sadness, happiness, hope, and faith.<br /><br />James Frey is a hard person to like in some parts of the book, but he is also someone to root for and wish success upon on his road after rehab.  He had a life where everything was handed to him and he just wanted to be successful at this on his own and it seems that he has been.<br /><br />There are parts in the book, though, that frustrate the heck out of me.  James just won't believe in God or the 12 steps of AA.  He just won't and fights everyone on that belief.  If you believe in those things it can be hard to believe that someone can have so little faith in something that seems to work for everyone else.  There are times when James seems so self-righteous and you'll want to scream.  There are other times when you can't believe this guy is still alive.  And there are other times when you want to cheer and root for him.<br /><br />My favorite \\"character\\" in the book is Leonard.  He makes for interesting reading, and makes you want to root for his success as well.  In society, the people in this book would be considered less than worthy of praise, hope, and faith...but in this book you root for them to succeed.  I recommend reading the book with an open mind and as a character story, rather than a memoir.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Having seen the different versions of this movie. I can positively say that this doesn't disapppoint. This is positive and uplifting Keira Knightly plays a excellent heroine. It has a well-rounded cast which makes this movie exciting to watch. This is a must purchase.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is a tale that I fully recommend to everyone who is intrigued with adventure, loyalty, action and romance. The movie  exhibits grace, realism, some romance but also a sense for the search of truth and the human element of compassion for others. Each of the individual actors plays his or her part extremely well, and you can clearly sense that they really want to act their part and want to be in that make believe fantasy world; every single one of them is a true star; it is seldom to see such real acting and it puzzles me why these actors have never been more on the forefront of the cinema screen. The part of the secret operative sent to eliminate River, the girl searched for by the empire and gifted with psychic abilities, is played very well; his melancholic and somewhat sad nature contrasts beautifully with the never giving up captain of the Serenity crew, who even after having almost lost all his people in the war with the empire and is thoroughly dissapointed with the world and himself, still manages to find plenty of courage to come to the rescue of River and her brother. This element of compassion is a very strong theme in the movie and is the guiding principle from the beginning to the end. Even the slightly worn out idea of saving the universe from the manipulation of a degraded empire, still does it extremely well in this beautifully made movie.
0446614459|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it as long as you're willing to overlook a bad ending.  The story line is suspensful, the characters are engaging, and the reasearch behind the plot is solid.  That part gets 5 stars.  And then came the end, and I closed the book saying \\"I can't believe Baldacci wrote such a good book and then came up with such a ridiculous ending.\\"  Go ahead and read this one, but be ready to tread lightly at the end.
B000E6EJAC|5.0|\\"All The Young Dudes\\" was the first Mott The Hoople album I ever bought, and over 30 years later it remains their finest moment. \\"Dudes\\" was the group's fifth album, and their last with all five original members (Verden Allen was the first to go, in January 1973). Some complain of Bowie's typically thin mix (cf. \\"Raw Power\\"), or the slight distraction of the ringing telephone during \\"One Of The Boys\\", but for me the silliness at the end of \\"Violence\\" on the followup, \\"Mott\\" is far more of an irritant. \\"Mott\\" is a fine meditation on the ups and downs of rock and roll life, but \\"Dudes\\" - as sexy, liberating, and haunting today as it was in '72, remains the groups most potent statement and viscerally powerful music. Note I say 'group,' for this is also the last Mott album with everbody in the band (except drummer Buffin) very much involved in the songwriting.  <br />Of course, Bowie's title song is the centerpiece, but Mott's performance is passionate and definitive. Elsewhere the band rocks slow and steady ('Sucker') as well as fast and crunchy (the Stones-like 'Jerkin Crocus', vastly superior to \\"Mott's\\" too-similar 'Drivin' Sister'). Verden Allen's 'Soft Ground'is a fine song and great change of pace, but it should be noted that Mick Ralphs' 'Ready For Love' - all 7 minutes of it - beats the rather pat Bad Company version hands down and features some of Ralph's most lyrical playing on the marvelous, extended  instrumental coda. Other selling points: Ian Hunter's passionate closer 'Sea Diver', which hints (but does not succumb to) the slightly melodramatic tendencies evident on Mott's next two studio albums, and fabulously appropriate cover art. <br />This newly expanded version, it should go without saying, blows the old Sony CD away. The bonus cuts are strong, though it makes little sense to close with live Mott from Ariel Bender's tenure rather than something featuring Ralphs and Allen. With this new \\"Dudes,\\" released concurrently with a superbly remastered/expanded \\"Mott\\" the entire original Mott The Hoople catalog has been expanded and remastered for the 21st century.  <br />The Island/Atlatic albums have been beautifully upgraded by the Angel Air label, and \\"The Hoople\\" is available as a Sony import, now with excellent bonus tracks and superior sound (beware, it is not the first one listed at amazon, but can be identified by the \\"import\\" designation and slightly abbreviated title (\\"Hoople\\" rather than \\"The Hoople\\") in amazon's listings. One of the best rock and roll bands of the first half of the '70s is finally getting it due.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is definitely THE comeback album for DM - Dave's desire to share his happiness about coming out of rehab with the fans through the song \\"Suffer Well\\", and Martin's reflection on his divorce through the song \\"Precious\\"; are all part of what makes this album full of tell-tale emotions. It is a bit like \\"Ultra\\" - a bit dark, a bit contrived, but still full of optimisim about overcoming one's inner sorrows, regrets, and sins. Martin is by far the most amazing and inspiring song writer on the face of the earth, and DM's success with this tour(That I've seen 2 times already) is a living proof that DM will never let their fans down!
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|I'm not sure why the script writers turned the Bennets into poorly dressed, groomed and behaved...slobs, really...living in an unkempt farm house. Or Lizzie Bennet twirling around on a swing in the barn, _barefoot_? The pig walking through their house was just too much. Lowering the family in this manner made the film very objectionable to me.     So much of Jane Austen's wonderful, witty dialogue is omitted, and occasionally handed off to someone else to suit the scenes. The story had a casual, Colonial American feel to it rather than the prim and proper English flavor as it was written. Darcy, Lady Katherine and Mrs. Bennet were very dull. Bingly was very miscast as a dolt. Jane Bennet, Mr. Wickam and troublesome Lydia were practically invisible. So much of the rich romantic tension between Elizabeth and Darcy was lost by cutting out so much of the story.    If you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, you'll be pleased with the 1995 miniseries. You'll see the Bennets careful to behave within the social politics of their society. They aren't wealthy, but they still dress, groom and carry themselves well. Mrs. Bennet is an obnoxious, gossipy social climber. Mr. Darcy is proud and unlikeable until Lizzie sets him straight during his rude marriage proposal. Mr. Bingly is intelligent and kindhearted. Lady Katherine gives Lizzie a hard time with her pious prejudice. Mr. Collins is amusing in his cluelessness. Mr. Wickam is a rake you'll love to hate.     I know a 2 hour movie can't compare to a 6 hour miniseries. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the miniseries first, I would've liked the theater version. But I really didn't enjoy it at all because so much of the story was cut out and/or changed.
B000002LGW|5.0|This album, this show, the DVD....Martin, Dave, Fletch (And the surely missed Alan), they're all simply AMAZING!!!!!!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is incredible, but a bit depressing... <br />Therefore, if you want to see what the movie COULD have been, go to youtube and watch the Requiem for a Dream Parody Trailer. It gives you a whole new outlook on the film!
B000000WZ4|5.0|This is what Martin and the rest of DM really wanted to make - a deep, somewhat dark, elegant, and intensely emotional album. It is also Martin's favorite DM album thus far because it's all about his reflection on the darker side of life...which myself and most DM fans can relate. I love ALL of Martin's work, and this album is one that I will treasure for life.
B00003CXAA|5.0|One of the best films in history which tackles family, loyalty & betrayal. Geez just saying that gives me goosebumps.......
B000E8QVWY|3.0|Walking the Fine Line between Clever and Stupid <br />By Jayson Harsin <br /> <br />From \\"the Man in Black,\\" 1971: Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on. <br /> <br />I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, <br />Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, <br />I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, <br />But is there because he's a victim of the times. <br /> <br />I wear the black for those who never read, <br />Or listened to the words that Jesus said, <br />About the road to happiness through love and charity, <br />Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. <br /> <br />Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, <br />In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, <br />But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, <br />Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black. <br /> <br />Thumbs up and down. I was thoroughly entertained by Walk the Line, James Mangold's attempt to be the first cinematic commentary on the recently deceased Johnny Cash. The acting and singing were superb. T. Bone Burnett's musical production is often mesmerizing. But the narrative arc attracts criticism, particularly the reduction of Cash's life to a quest for June Carter and a kind of Oedipal Complex with his father. <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon can't easily be judged on her fidelity to June Carter's historical character unless one has access to ample clips from Carter's early career. That said, Witherspoon's acting and singing are strong in the role she plays as a coquettish country legend occasionally pestered by Christian guilt. Witherspoon's singing and HeeHaw-like sketch smarts are admirable. She has it down. <br /> <br />But the film's focus is of course Cash. I was in awe of Joaquin Phoenix's masterful portrayal of the Man in Black. As a fan of Cash, I have seen him live, and seen clips of him when he was younger. It was as if Phoenix had carefully studied Cash's most intricate facial mannerisms, his walk,and his speech patterns. I also applaud the cosmetic team's styling of his hair, clothes, and body into a character I never could have guessed would so remarkably resemble the legend himself. <br /> <br />The camera work in this film depends on a lot of close-ups which give it a melodramatic aura. It's difficult to say whether that's bad in general. Cash was a man that struggled with his demons, who stirred emotions in his music and persona. A film about Cash would be lacking if it did not include some of the powerful melodrama that was in fact his life. Close up shots also invite viewer identification with the hero. <br /> <br />Interestingly, these shots and the access to Cash's personal life humanize him, even explode his traditional masculine persona. He is often portrayed as weak, lacking confidence from early childhood to the film's end. <br /> <br />But the melodramatic devices are captive to a kind of Hollywood love story. The choice to focus on Cash's early life is highly reductive and typical of Hollywood screen formulas. In this story, two major forces seem to propel Cash's early life: a love quest for June Carter, the starlet of royal country ilk, and an Oedipal drive to conquer his father. Both drives are located in his early life. In a sense, this narrative choice makes the film a narrow psychological study. <br /> <br />Cash is marked by his humble cotton-picking origins, a harsh father, a close and protective older brother, and his love of early country on the radio, where his love for June Carter begins. The early loss of his brother leaves Cash forever struggling with the trauma of losing his best friend and paternal love. The hardworking but emotionally icy father is resentful that God took his eldest and \\"best son.\\" \\"You took the wrong son,\\" he cries in a poignant scene that forever marks young Johnny's future. A refrain that runs through the film is \\"You look like you're goin' to a funeral [,John].\\" And Cash's response, \\"Maybe I am\\" is traced to this original event: his brother's death/funeral. Cash is forever going to his brother's funeral. <br /> <br />The other major force propelling Cash's life is his love for June Carter. As children, he and his brother hear the girl's beautiful voice as she sings on the radio with her famous family. There the seed of love is planted. Much of the rest of the film suggests Cash's aimless mistakes in career and marriage are a hapless wandering until he finds his fated soul mate and true love, June Carter. It bears some fairytale trappings, since when Cash gets the girl his problems appear to disappear, few as they are in the film--namely, drugs, insecurity, and oedipal hate towards his father. In Hollywood, apparently, all you need is love. <br /> <br />Different viewers will have other things to object to in this portrayal. Historical material of a docu-drama always invites comparisons to \\"the real thing\\" and accusations of infidelity to the real. While Cash is hardly portrayed as an angel, his first wife is portrayed as a 1950s uni-dimensional housewife, desiring all the dreamy accoutrements of upward mobility, ever wistfully searching for that irrecoverable Tupperware party. After weakly opposing Cash's dream to live by the sweat of his guitar, she figures out that what she really wants is a family man and the attention that any kind of spouse deserves. The story may not encourage complete sympathy with Cash in his family relations, but as hero of the film, Cash's familial misdemeanours are easily overlooked and his wife is potentially transformed into a shrewish, jealous bore. June Carter, on the other hand, is portrayed as a strong woman, caring yet determined, and able to reconcile her own choices with the judgments of others. <br /> <br />Reducing Cash's life to these two major forces, father and love, can be seen as the cost of generic constraints on mass-circulated films with big stars and budgets. Here one should return to Cash's \\"Man in Black\\" lyrics, written in 1971. Cash was not a Lee Greenwood; his was a different kind of country music, not easily appropriated by the Republican noise machine. Though he had only had brief stints in jail, he had drug and other problems and identified with those who had transgressed and been punished or who had the misfortune of growing up in cotton fields and without resources many take for granted. The film ends in 1968, and we get an on-screen script that reduces the final 35 years of Cash's life to a footnote: \\"June and Johnny lived happily ever after.\\" Ah, the pleasure of fairy tale closure. Is that all there was to the Man in Black? No, but that's all this narrative has time for. What would Johnny say? <br /> <br />Jayson Harsin <br />February 21, 2006 [...] <br /> <br />
B0009R1T7M|3.0|I was very excited about this album, given Amazon choosing it as the 2005 album of the year. They reference several artists I adore (Cake, The Sea) as being indicative of what I would hear. I also like very personal, intimate lo-fi (self-produced works) that are rich with imagery and originality. For example \\"In the Aeroplane over the Sea\\" by Neutral Milk Hotel is my idea of a real masterpiece in this genre. Unfortunately I did not respond to \\"Illinoise\\". It's emotionally quite leaden, despite steven's belle and sebastian heartfelt warbling. Unfortunately, that also applies to the songwriting which I found far too laboriously delicate and ineffective. melodically, it's forgettable and it never adds up to a truly moving or infectious listening experience. All in all, a major disapointment -- and i was so hoping for one.  However, I will buy \\"Pennslyvania\\" so I can hear a dity called \\"Pirogies and Funnel Cake\\".  Yes, the 50 states idea is a cute one. for now.
B00005JMEW|1.0|When I saw the trailer of this movie I had a feeling Kill Bill would not be a movie I would like. After seeing it my premonitions proved correct. Kill Bill has nothing to offer in comparison to a whole lot of other violent movies. Everything I liked about the previous films of Tarantino was missing. Intelligent plot and humor, very good acting, characters with depth, and I could go on, were all missing. The whole movie was a big clich&eacute;. Tarantino probably did that on purpose, but then still intentional boring clich&eacute;s are still boring. Not to say that KB is not well made in a technical sense. It's just not the special film that we all know Tarantino can make.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This is my favorite of all the TNG movies and to me second only to Wrath of Khan among all the feature films.<br /><br />It's not very cerebral stuff, but the story is continually moved along by action, adventure, beautiful special effects, humor (including the painful to watch \\"star trek\\" line) and most of all a brilliant soundrack.  This is the kind of soundtrack where you can just crank up the soundtrack CD (which I own) and enjoy it as a piece of music without even seeing the movie.<br /><br />Top it off with a moving tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and a wealth of other bonuses that I haven't even got around to watching yet.  This is a Trek movie that you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy.
B000077VR3|1.0|This movie has the look and feel of a Disney animation/live action movie. The plot and the storyline are very similar to Disney movies. Even the singing reminds of animation films like The Lion King. This is a kid's movie. The only part I liked is almost at the ending where Satine and the Duke have to 'consummate' their relationship. For the rest it's pretty bland and unsurprising and that counts for photography, story and setting. I recommend Terry Gilliam movies if you want some real substance.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Stones golden era included four albums that are head and shoulders above the rest of their very fine catalogue.  Every rock and roll fan should own Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Exile on Main Street and Sticky Fingers.  Four classic albums.  And in my opinion, Let it Bleed is the best of the four.  If it only contained the opening song, \\"Gimme Shelter\\", it would worth ten times the purchase price, but the record is strong from beginning to end.  \\"Midnight Rambler\\", \\"Country Honk\\", \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", \\"Monkey Man\\", etc.  Too good not to have.  The Stones do rock.  Still!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food. <br /> <br />When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games. <br /> <br />It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents. <br /> <br />The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.

B000002UB3|5.0|I wore out the vinyl playing it when it was new and I was finishing up grade school.  I still play Abbey Road more than any other album in my collection of over 1500 CDs.  There are a few other records which I think are just superb as complete collections - Springsteen's Born to Run, Stones' Let it Bleed, Led Zeppelin IV, Bob Marley's Exodus, and if I had to rank those would probably finish out my top five of all time.  And the Beatles' own Sgt. Pepper's, Revolver and The White Album are classics as well.  However, start to finish, Abbey Road is by far the greatest album released in my lifetime.  Everyone should own it and play it often.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food. <br /> <br />When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games. <br /> <br />It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents. <br /> <br />The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.

B000E97X66|1.0|I am a BIG Bruce Springsteen fan, and I have absolutely everything he releases, but this is a SCAM from Sony just to make money out of fans like me. I just bought it because I own every  official Springsteen release. But let me ask you something: How can Sony or Bruce himself have the nerve to release the same show they have just released 4 months ago? Don't get me wrong: the show is absolutely amazing, and the sound is perfect, but the way Sony is handling Bruce career is more than suspicious. And what I am more disappointed with is that Bruce is allowing this to happen.<br />Let me just suggest something: release all Bruce albums in SACD or Remaster editions, and then start a collection of bootlegs exactly the same way you are doing with Bob Dylan, and let Bruce record his studio albums and move forward.<br />[...]. Go ahead, you can say my review was not helpful. It's just fine with me. Again, the music is 5 stars, being this one of the greatest shows Bruce ever put together, but I am concerned about the way Sony is taking care of thes business.<br />What a shame!

Certainly jazz is freedom of expression but you have to know what you're doing and this book is the tool for that. Combine it with some tunes and mix in some listening, and the world of jazz is open to you. This should be a standard in every high school with a jazz program and every college lab band.

B00005JKGZ|5.0|Great.  Thank you so much for your promptness.  Arrived in excellent condition.
B000002H70|4.0|This album is probably the most beloved in their oeuvre by Cure fans and with justification: it's possessed of some of their most sterling songs (\\"Pictures of You\\",\\"Lovesong\\",\\"Lullaby\\") along with a strongly pervasive feel. When you put this on, the whole disc coalesces from the delicate chimes leading into \\"Plainsong\\" to the somber accordion that precedes \\"Untitled\\". The album doesn't so much play as wash over you, a richly dense orgasm of finely orchestrated texture and effusive emotion. I can only imagine what it must have felt like to hear these songs during the melodrama of teen life..they're dangerously somber even now, in my mid-30s.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />\\"Pictures of You\\" makes the prospect of living with vanishing memories of love lost bearable if only thanks to its insistent yet mellow guitar drive and glistening chimes. (\\"If only I had thought of the right words/I could have held on to your heart/If only I'd thought of the right words/I wouldn't be breaking apart\\") Parade marching drum meets horror movie organ on \\"Closedown\\". \\"Lovesong\\" is a great evocation of how it feels to find your \\"other half\\". (\\"Whenever I'm alone with you/You make me feel like I am home again/Whenever I'm alone with you/You make me feel like I am whole again\\") It's probably as sentimental as Robert Smith's ever allowed his writing to get and he was rewarded with still strong airplay years later. If there's a more disturbing bedtime tale than Smith's whispered \\"Lullaby\\", I don't want to hear it. (\\"And his tongue in my eyes, 'Be still, be calm, be quiet now'/'My precious boy, don't struggle like that or I will only love you more'/For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light/The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight\\") The pizzicato violin sound that embellishes the melody ups the creepiness factor. Shattering glass welcomes you into the title track. (\\"So it's all come back round/to breaking apart again/Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again\\")<br /><br />LOWS:<br /><br />Smith and company start things on a bit of the wrong foot by overplaying their hand with the Phil Spectoresque echo on the vocals for \\"Plainsong\\". I like the song, but it would have been better had the reverb been a bit more restrained. Please note..my calling it a \\"low\\" is comparison against the rest of the tracks here more than my suggesting that it's not worth your time to listen to.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />If you've just found the Cure from their GALORE disc, this is the one to get next.br />LOWS: <br />Smith and company start things on a bit of the wrong foot by overplaying their hand with the Phil Spectoresque echo on the vocals for \\"Plainsong\\".

B00005JOFO|5.0|Lee Ang proved that he could direct once again with Brokeback Mountain. Relationship drama is always Lee's strength and the move to direct the Hulk movie could be regarded as one of the biggest mistakes in his directing career.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain could be said as a continuation Lee Ang's attempt to read into a gay loving story. Wedding Banquet is one of his major successes. It precisely nailed down the dilemmas of a how a gay American Chinese tried to act straight in front of his parents, even going to the extent of having a fake wedding to satisfy the expectations of his family. In Brokeback Mountain, two guys deeply in love in a forbidden age within a forbidding profession. Heath Ledger gave his prime performance as the cowboy with little words Ennis. He is bad in expressing his emotions and the only emotion he could exhibit is his anger. Ennis' lack of speech and strong social conscious immediately place the undying relationship into the grave right from the start. Jake Gyllenhaal plays brilliantly as the part of Jack, who in his whole life try to make the relationship work at all cost. They met, they part and all they can look forward to is an opportunity to meet again, sometime. For Ennis and Jack, each departure could mean forever. It's stressful, heartbreaking and sad. This could be summed up by Jack's monologue \\"I wish I could quit you...all we have left is the Brokeback Mountain\\" It's an addiction that both parties cannot quit, but at the same time cannot uphold.<br /><br />Michelle Williams showcasted a power performance as Ennis' wife, who accidentally discovered her husband's real love. Devastated, heartbroken but determined to stay silence for many years. I read that she was disowned by her high school because of her participation in the project. But a high school ownership doesn't mean anything for an actor to have such a breathtaking and memorable performance (maybe her high school should disown every single graduate who went through a divorce then).<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain certainly marks a performance of an outstanding cast with an outstanding story. The dialogues are so well written that they completely and tightly tie the plot together. Heath Ledger is different as Nicole Kidman is different in The Hours. Jake Gyllenhall once again proved that he is one of the best young talents in Hollywood. For Lee Ang, this is an incredible movie that put him right back on to the map of the best directors of the current age - only if he is going to choose his next project right.divorce then).  <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain certainly marks a performance of an outstanding cast with an outstanding story.

B00003CXUM|5.0|There's nothing I can add in my review about the plot or story of \\"In the Mood for Love\\" that hasn't already been covered, so I will keep this brief. <br /> <br />Wong Kar-Wai's \\"In the Mood for Love\\" is a remarkable piece of work - sensuous but not showy, restrained but highly intriguing, and satisfyingly unresolved.  I dare anyone who considers themselves a film connoisseur to watch this and not be impressed.  Every shot is expertly framed, every color and costume choice agonized over, every piece of music is nothing short of appropriate.  The performances by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung and are superb and often, more is said with a lingering expression than dialogue could ever convey.  Their chemistry isn't just realistic; it's electric. <br /> <br />Now to be perfectly clear, not everyone will like this movie.  It simply lacks the comforting elements that make the usual Hollywood tripe palatable to the masses.  But, for those who would rather savor Hangar One than down Smirnoff, this one's for you.  This is no mere film - it is art.  It is what lesser movies aspire to be when they grow up.

He is undoubtedly a masterful draftsman, but the less experienced artist reading his book would expect to be led step by step on such an important aspect of drawing from life.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|It's impossible for all new bands to sound truly original nowadays, but this is ridiculous. Imitation is the sincerest form of shallowness. The first three songs here rock out pretty well, but after that the sheer shameless mimicry of the Avenged Sevenfold sound becomes relentlessly embarrassing. They probably feel in their hearts that they're paying tribute to classic metal, but what they're really doing is cherry-picking old stereotypes and imitating them wholesale. All the weaknesses of the Avenged Sevenfold approach can be heard in a track like \\"Sidewinder,\\" in which a slavish imitation of an Iron Maiden axe attack morphs into a laughable Santana-like Latin acoustic groove. Combining multiple styles like this might appear to be a sign of ambition and talent, until you realize that this trick is yet another imitation in itself, from more influential bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Other attempts at musical significance, such as the orchestral portions of \\"The Wicked End\\" and \\"Strength of the World,\\" would be believable elsewhere, but here they're just exercises in doom-metal stereotypes.<br /><br />The lamely-nicknamed guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance know how to sling those axes for sure, except they have few ideas beyond the dueling guitar styles of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, or the classic early thrash of Metallica and Megadeth. And the band's weakest link is the even more lamely-nicknamed singer M. Shadows, who is so busy trying to sound like everyone else in metal and punk that he has no distinct voice of his own &#8211; that is, when he's not stuck in a completely shameless Axl Rose impression, especially in the cloying power ballad attempt \\"Seize the Day.\\" And don't even get me started on the shallow and stereotypical lyrics. This includes the maudlin tribute to Dimebag Darrell in \\"Betrayed\\" and the third-hand soldier's lament in \\"MIA.\\" (However, there is one exception to the trend in lousy lyrics &#8211; the effective politics of \\"Blinded in Chains\\"). I'll give Avenged Sevenfold props for really knowing how to play their instruments and for thinking big, especially in comparison to all the small-minded and under-achieving metal we have these days. But this doesn't mean that those musical skills and big thoughts are going anywhere. [~doomsdayer520~]of \\"Blinded in Chains\\").

B00000I07P|4.0|Bon Jovi is a band that may not be the best one (the best one's were Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd), but their record-sales say otherwise. There is perhaps a grain of truth in the notion that half of their audience were teenagers and women and their sucess was soemwhat overrated, as well as that they went big on Jon Bon Jovi's coiffeur and outlook, though. <br />   Nonetheless, I think they truly deserved their overwhealming breakthrough from the 80's offering people catchy, competent and well-ctrafted pop-rock-metal tunes played on and on by the MTV. All in all, that's how metal sounded in the mid-80's (just take Whitesnake or Def Leppard). Personally, I have always been an advocate of this band, turning a blind eye on what other narrow-minded people kept saying about it. Yes, Bon Jovi has made couple of cheesy songs (\\"Always\\") and some both cheesy and too commercial as well (\\"It's my life\\"). \\"It's my life\\" was a cheap trial to break to the pop-charts, but, if there are any open-minded music passionates there, you will notice that other bands had it as well (Van Halen had \\"Jump\\", KISS had \\"I was made for loving you\\"). <br />  One has to take the band as a whole, and simply can't deny  the skillful and well-crafted musicanship of albums like \\"New Jersey\\" or \\"Keep the faith\\". So, if you are too narrow-minded to rate this, you simply have no right to proclaim yourself a music-passionate or music-knower. Please, don't get me wrong, Bon Jovi WAS a commercial band, and there's no use in comparing them to Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd. But in what they did, they were the best.   <br />\\"Slippery when wet\\" sold 18 million copies worldwide up to this date and it speaks for itself - no comment. But it is true that it is neither their best album, not even as good as \\"New Jersey\\" or \\"Keep the faith\\". I, a self-proclaimed Bon Jovi fan (and an open-minded music passionate as general) who peruses BJ's career for years, claim here that Bon Jovi's incredible breakthroughshould have come with their previous LP, namely \\"7800 Fahrenheit\\" (which is, don't know why, forsaken and forelorn by everyone including the band). But, after very intermediate success of that perhaps least commercial one in their entire career (which nonetheless sold and reached gold-status) Jon, Richie and songwriter for hire Desmond Child took the plunge for something else. Namely, they wrote a pile of songs and examined the reaction of teenagers on them in a local pizzeria to find out which meet with enthusiastic reaction of the listeners. That entailed fierce criticism and they were immediately wrote off by the critics. Well, not neccesairly righteously, becasue musics aim is to entertain and deliver fun. History shows there were very good bands (like Alan Parson's Project, for that instance) which didn't sell well becasue they aimed at a very thin circle of audience. One can argue, which way is better, though. <br />Bon Jovi phenommenon started to exist when their first no.1 hit-single, the heavy-metal \\"You give love a bad name\\" hit the charts. Both this one's, and \\"Living on a prayer's\\" success of course as well, were much propelled by the vidoes played in then-starting MTV - this changed their lives and catapulted them into international mega-stars. <br />Anyway, this one is a very good one indeed, but it arguably does have perhaps 2 fillers: \\"Wild in the streets\\" and \\"Without love\\".These tracks are OK, but nothing else. Perhaps it would have been better if they had included \\"We rule the night\\" instead (which was a cut from that sessions and appeared recently on \\"100,000,000 Fans\\"). \\"Rise your hands\\" is also only a good song. Yet, indeed, the rest is really great - so, again Bon Jovi at their peak. I mean, apart from those blockbusters who everyone knows (and perhaps wants to get this album only for these songs; \\"Wanted\\", \\"Love\\" and \\"Prayer\\") there are minor gems like for instance \\"Let it rock\\", which is a classic BJ-rocker with catchy chorus, nice percussion, great and long guitar-solo by Richie (one of his bests) and well-crafted intro on keyboards by David Bryan. \\"Social disease\\" is exactly such a good one as well. Finally, in my humble opinion thier best power-ballad ever, \\"Never say goodbye\\" which was released on a single in Europe and was a big hit also here in Poland. <br />As far as the lyrical content is concerned, they are blissfully <br />untouched with political or religious content or other intricate innuendos. Honest, directly from heart, drenched with love, sex, and not very deep or elaborate in fact. But this is the magic of this album. But whooah! these boys were 21-25 of age! They were wild and manifested it in their songs! If one would like to peruse how BJ matured in terms of lyirics, I would recommend here \\"These days\\" form 1995.  <br />Overall, Bon Jovi has produced a leveled, well-skilled, powerful, passionate, catchy and entertaing album which was indeed quite commercial, yet manged to appeal to a very wide and diverse public. That openness help BJ to sell this one in spades. Unfortunately critics didn't like it, but anyway - who are critics??? They are people, just as we all are, and they judge according to their own taste as everybody else. <br />All in all, this is a very good album, but I would like a newcomer to prod him/her towards the \\"New Jersey\\" from 1988. <br />Please read my other, REAL Bon Jovi reviews.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is the story of two cowboys, Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist, hired in the summer of 1963 to tend to a herd of sheep in the mountains of Wyoming.  Ennis is unfailingly, unflinchingly played by Heath Ledger--and if he doesn't take the Oscar for Best Actor, I will truly be shocked--a character who could easily have stepped whole and breathing off the pages of a good Western novel (think Louis L'Amour, Zane Grey, Edward Abbey or even Michael Gear), every inch the stoic man of few words.  Jack (the excellent Jake Gyllenhaal--check him out in October Skies and The Day After Tomorrow, among other films) is a more voluble character, frisky and chatty, but also deeply sympathetic...and fated, as you will see if you watch the film.<br /><br />There is a great deal of tension between them from the film's beginning, when we first meet Ennis and Jack as they wait by the boss-man's trailer to find out the low-down on the job.  Jack watches Ennis discretely; Ennis remains impassive, appearing to take no notice of Jack at all.  They are sent up to Brokeback Mountain, and all seems normal until one night, when Ennis decides to sleep outside the tent (which they don't often share, as one usually remains with the sheep while the other minds their camp).  Jack sees that Ennis is freezing and commands him to come inside the tent--after mere minutes of body heat, the chemistry explodes into violent lovemaking (by which I mean intense, explosive, urgent).<br /><br />Despite this, the two remain in denial about their relationship (\\"God knows we ain't queers,\\" says Ennis), yet it clearly affects them both deeply, Ennis with perhaps greater turmoil--as they part ways at the end of that first summer, he dashes into an alley between two buildings in the Wyoming hamlet below the mountain and is violently sick.  After Ennis' marriage to Alma, his fiancee, this denied tendency shows up briefly in their marriage (there is a sex scene in which Ennis flips Alma over on her stomach and takes her from behind, despite her choked protests), and Alma surreptitiously discovers the truth of her husband's relationship with Jack when they are reunited in 1967, having not seen each other for four years, and tearfully ponders how she's going to handle this awful knowledge.<br /><br />Over the years, the two men get together infrequently--Jack always going to Ennis, never the other way round--and both wind up getting divorces from their respective spouses.  The tension of their relationship shows up in all manner of ways (when Ennis fights a man in the street after a nasty argument with Alma, or Jack's disagreement with his father-in-law over whether his son should be allowed to watch football during Thanksgiving dinner--Jack wins that one); Ennis is frightened and conflicted by their relationship, while Jack's heart clearly aches and yearns for Ennis.  That this is never resolved makes the ending all the more poignant and painful.<br /><br />It helps to remember that, in 1963 when the film begins, homosexuality was still considered a mental illness (not taken off the books until 1973, four years after the Gay Rights Movement began in earnest), so Ennis' fears are well-grounded.  But the heart wants what it wants, and sometimes getting it requires the ultimate sacrifice.  This film gives us that lesson in painful yet memorable detail; all the performances are excellent, even Randy Quaid's turn as Jack and Ennis' boss at Brokeback...truly a man of his time.  Run--don't walk--to the nearest cinema where this is playing, and see Brokeback Mountain.

0812550706|5.0|This is simply the best book written for boys from age 8-9 and up.  Not to say that girls won't like it - it is a great story, with a truly engaging plot and a hero that you just have to root for.  I turned all three of my kids on to this book, and my \\"reads to live\\" daughter probably loves it more than her brothers.  But if you have a boy in your life who doesn't like to read - this book could turn that around. It is easy to read without being simplistic; Ender is a kid that anyone can relate to; and the hurdles and tests he faces are enough to keep you turning pages all night.  And here's the dealclincher - Ender's Game has a very strong moral core in the story that resonates and makes you think.  Okay, I know Ender's game is not great literature, it may not even be great writing - but it is a truly great book.

078681859X|5.0|Can't help it - I love sarcastic characters. Bartimaeus is such a grumpy, tongue-in-cheek, biting wit kind of djinni.  The book takes turns hearing about events from Nathaniel's point of view (the young magician) and from Bartimaeus's view, which could be confusing - but in practice it just keeps it interesting. Still, it takes a good plot with some depth to keep me reading and that is what this author delivers.  I especially like the way each character truly has to struggle with making choices and with their conscience.  It's a keeper.
0671015206|5.0|Excellent book.  Based on years of research and statistics gathered from interviews with the wealthy.  I noticed another review with some nonsense about the book listing Europeans as major players.  At this point they did not read the rest of the book but yet continued to give a poor review hinting the book was racially motivated.  To give a review you need to finish the book.  This book is fair, accurate, and facts are backed up through statistics.  Excellent book!

NME declared \\"Artic Monkeys have delivered a Definitely Maybe\\" (referring to Oasis' debut album). Not so fast...<br /><br />\\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" (13 tracks, 41 min.) brings basically a great bar band delivering mostly up-tempo songs about the life of 19 and 20 yr. olds (which is what the band members are). Track 2 \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" is the break-out single and an irresitable 3 min. blast of great music. While the first half of the album staggers a bit, the second half truly takes off with the pensive \\"Riot Van\\", followed by the best track of all, \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured\\", a slightly reggae-flavored track that delights and delivers. Other stand-outs follow: \\"Mardy Hum\\" is a mellow singalong, and \\"Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But...\\" is the meatiest track of all. \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" is the other attention-grabbing single, quite good.<br /><br />In all, this is quite a good album. But to say that this equals the towering \\"Definitely Maybe\\" does disservice to Arctic Monkeys. Let these guys (kids, really) develop and let's see where they go from here.
B000002U82|5.0|The dark side of the moon is one of the greatest albums of the great classic rock era.It is a pity that such great albums are not being made any more.I hope these guys reunite and make more such albums again.very highly recommended.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Panic! At the Disco has created quite a buzz with its break-out single \\"The Only Difference\\", which is an irresitable singalong. Now comes the album.<br /><br />\\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" (13 tracks, 40 min.) starts off with a short instrumental, to then dive straight into the afore-mentioned \\"The Only Difference\\". Subsequent tracks \\"London Beckoned\\" and \\"Nails for Breakfast\\" continue on the same neck-breaking pace. Things slow down (but just a bit) on \\"Lying Is the Most Fun For a Girl\\", the last track of \\"Side 1\\" (track 7). After an instumental intermission, things kick up again with the delicious \\"But It's Better If You Do\\", and another highlight later on \\"Side 2\\" is \\"There's a Good Reason\\".<br /><br />The album blasts by in no time. Musically, the album reminds me of Brand New, and that's a good thing in my book. There are a lot of emo bands out there but Panic! At the Disco is a band to be watched as they bring their sound with a great sophistication. \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is highly recommended!
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is one of the best albums made during the classic rock era and ranks only second to the dark side of the moon in greatness.very highly recommended because of songs like comfortably numb,run like hell and another brick in the wall.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese undertakes the seemingly impossible taks of putting together the ultimate documentary of Bob Dylan's early career (1961-1966). As a long-time Bob Dylan fan, this documentary is riveting and shocking (in a positive way).<br /><br />\\"No Direction Home: Bob Dylan\\" (2 DVDs) contains quite a few surprises: first of all, Dylan himself provides commentary in a clear and focused way, not at all as one might expect from an artist who mostly appears on stage aloof, if not disinterested. Second, the footage that Scorsese uses, is absolutely astounding. Check for example the various Newport Folk Festival appearances. While DVD1 traces the early years of Dylan's childhood, and gives a good musical context of which artists influenced Dylan, the real treasures are on DVD2, and in particular the footage from the 1966 UK and European tour. Watch how an exhausted Dylan towards the end exasperates \\"I don't want to go to Italy! I don't want to go nowhere! I just want to go home!\\" The documentary ends with the infamous \\"Judas\\" performance of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", which has long been available on CD, but now for the first time is shown on film. And amidst it all, Dylan the elder-statesman comments how sick he was of it all by then (mid-1966). No surprise then that he made such subsequent incomprehensible albums like \\"Self-Portrait\\"! Anything to be one step ahead of the public's expectations.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a number of extra features, the best of which is a collection of 8 Dylan performances, including early TV performances, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" from the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, an unfinished \\"I Can't Leave Her Behind\\" from his hotel room in 1966, and 2 more songs from the 1966 UK tour. The sound quality is surprisingly good throughout. In all, this should be required viewing for anyone-young and old--interested in music (and not just folk or rock). Outstanding from beginning to end! BUY IT!
B000AP04L0|3.0|This movie could've been a lot better and I think it had the potential to be a classic.  David Herman, a MAD TV alum, turns in a great performance as does the rest of the cast, however, I felt something was lacking in the flick.  I have to disagree with one reviewer who asked, \\"Is this the best comedy ever?\\" No, deinitely not, but it does have its moments.  If you've ever worked for a soul-sucking corporation, then you'll probably be able to relate to this movie better than I did.  All in all, its worth a rental or if you want a goofy movie, then get it.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Ok, so I'm a late comer- but I was only 7 when this first came out. I recently bought it along with the only 4 others that I didn't have in order to complete my Madonna collection. I've always been a fan of the Single \\"Like A Prayer\\" (and the video) but I really didn't think I was going to fall in love with this CD like I have!! I can't stop playing it. I think about these songs all day while I'm at work. This CD is just brilliant. Apparently \\"Ray of Light\\" wasn't her first emotional album. She really pours her heart out in quite a few songs. <br /> <br />The first track is of Course the title track- which is just great! But it is a bit different from the version I am used to hearing on the radio. <br /> <br />Next is \\"Express Yourself\\"- with that beautiful line \\"Don't go for second best, baby, put your lovin' to the test\\"- it has been my relationship guideline ever since I heard this song. It's really a \\"Girl Power\\" song, really positive message. <br /> <br />Then there's \\"Love Song\\"- a fantastic duet with Prince. At first I was gonna hate, but as I listened to it I realized it was truly an awesome song. Very funky and sexy-everything you would expect from Prince. The vocals are great their voices really blend terrifically. However, I noticed that she plagerized her ownself by re-using the lyrics \\"time goes by so slowly for those who wait/those who run seem to have all the fun\\"-sound familiar???!!!!(2005's \\"Hung Up\\") <br /> <br />Next is my absolute favorite track on the album- \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\"- it starts off with this really poppy almost calypso sound and I thought it was going to be really mushy and sickening- but this song has depth! I wondered if she was talking about her own marriage to Sean Penn in this one. It's kind of a sad song about a broken marriage. It reminds me of Suzanne Vega's \\"Luka\\"- depressing lyrics/ great dance beat. Did I mention this was my favorite?!!! Love it!!!! <br /> <br />Then there's \\"Promise to Try\\"- I almost cried during this one- it sounds like she's talking about her mother. Very moving. <br /> <br />Next up is \\"Cherish\\"- that's another good one. There's nothing to say about this one that hasn't been already said. <br /> <br />After that \\"Dear Jessie\\"- I believe this was a birthday song for a friend's kid. I don't really like it. Sounds like something that would be in a \\"Disney Movie\\". <br /> <br />Another one of my faves- \\"Oh Father\\"- So moving! I can totally relate to this one. This song helped me get through my own parent's break-up and learning to live with an unloving father. She really pours all her emotion into this one. <br /> <br />\\"Keep It Together\\" is definitely a jam- with it Cuban and Jazz infused rhythm and Madonna's lyrics. Really touching- talks about families and how you should stay close to one another. <br /> <br />Another tear-jerker- \\"Spanish Eyes\\"- this is just beautiful! This shows her range as a singer, she really tries hard to hit those notes and does quite a good job.  <br /> <br />The whole disc ends with total trip- \\"Act of Contrition\\"- this is weird- there's this amazing fusion of a Choir and Guitar riffs and drums it's like having a spiritual vision. It's like she's singing a prayer or something.I can't describe it better than this you just have to hear it for yourself- those who have heard this will know what I mean. (\\"What Do you Mean It's Not in The Computer!!!!!) <br /> <br />Overall- I just love it! It's one I would run into a bruning building to save. A classic. <br />
B00027JYLC|5.0|It's fantastic. There were no \\"special\\" effects and makeup back when this was filmed. These are real people, and alas, considered freaks, too. The storyline is a classic \\"evil woman/good kind man\\", and a predictable ending, but it is one of my all time favorites, (and I pretty much don't like movies,) just because of the cast and the era it was filmed in.
0679422714|5.0|It is clear that the authors of this biography of Mao view him as a monster who visited death on tens of millions and unimaginable misery on hundreds of millions for the sake of his personal ambitions and vanities masked in the costume of a brand of Marxism - Leninism that was really Stalinism on steroids.  I believe they are correct in the large picture of the man and his life as absolute ruler of China.  Is it also necessary that they get all the details correct?  Let me ask this of those who criticize what they think are errors in this book.  Do they also fault Edgar Snow and other Western writers and thinkers who supported a completely uncritical view of Mao as a blessing for China and an example for the world?<br /><br />Here is another self-check.  If in your heart you find yourself feeling complete blackness towards the despotism and criminality of Nixon and Joe McCarthy, but \\"balance\\" towards Mao, does that honestly make sense?<br /><br />The authors show clearly how Mao built his myth.  A great part of that myth building was destroying the lives of anyone who dared to contradict it and eliminating every opponent who dared to raised his or her head even a tremble.  Whether or not there was the famous battle at Dadu Bridge, it is clear that he and his favored cadres were carried on the Long March by bearers who were sacrificed for Mao's comfort.  They died while he read in relative comfort.  He made sure that he and his cadres were well fed while his soldiers and servants starved.  Whether or not Mao was protected from Chiang Kei-shek by Stalin does not obviate the fact that Chiang also had ties to Moscow, that his son was there during the time in question, and that his army was riddled with Red moles including high ranking generals.<br /><br />As for the tens of millions of deaths during the Great Leap Forward, saying that they were somehow accidental and unintentional is an evil in itself.  Mao was clear in his intentions to starve the entire population into submission and advocated the same program to other \\"world leaders\\".  When people are weak and hungry they tend not to make much of a fuss, you see.  That Mao was pursuing superpower ambitions and funding other nations with aid in a bid to put himself as the world leader of communism is beyond dispute.  Food was taken from millions of the Chinese people and sent to the Soviet Union, its bloc allies, and other nations whom Mao was trying to influence.<br /><br />Mao did turn the entire nation of China into a terror prison.  Yes, some did benefit and they are proud to talk about it.  When I was attending the University of Michigan Business School, I met many wonderful and talented students from China.  They were all very supportive of Mao and didn't think a few million deaths were such a big deal because China has lots of people.  I wonder if they would have felt the same if their family would have been persecuted as \\"landlords\\" under Mao.  Oh, and these otherwise fine folks almost universally support what China has done and is doing in Tibet as a way of freeing people from poverty and superstition.  Yes, really.<br /><br />I have also met Chinese here in Ann Arbor whose families were persecuted and killed during the Cultural Revolution.  They tend to take a more dim view of Mao's accomplishments.  Just as the miseries of \\"Great Leap Forward\\" were no accident, the Cultural Revolution was a carefully orchestrated purge designed to keep Mao in power.  Again, millions died.  Saying that those who died were \\"Capitalist Roaders\\" or just human detritus as Philip Short does in the epilogue of his biography of Mao is itself an obscenity.  Imagine justifying murder because someone differed in his views of politics of desires for the future.  The destruction of China's past and the corruption of its historical traditions may have had some freeing benefits that some can point to, but the cost was surely not worth it.  And as subsequent Chinese history shows, such imposed changedoes not last, although it does have lasting effects (as does any major injury).<br /><br />The role of the United States in China is at best ambiguous; some would argue that our work there is abysmal.  Not only were we poorly served by apologists (I can't call them journalists) of the ilk of Edgar Snow, we had very poor judgment from people such as Gen. George Marshall and other Western leaders.  The trip by Nixon and Kissinger has to be seen in terms of the Cold War, but was not clearly good or wholly bad.  Our relations with China were shaped more or less because the concern with China was secondary or less with some other events in the world.  Still, in hindsight, these tradeoffs are more clear.<br /><br />While I am not a historian, I think this book gets a lot more right than it gets wrong.  One of the useful tricks of dissemblers, such as those who smear this book, is to try to dismiss uncomfortable facts by saying they are old news.  We see all kinds of politicians use this gambit all the time.  However, as some TV networks remind us, if you haven't seen it before, it's new for you!  So, I recommend this book strongly (along with \\"The Private Life of Chairman Mao\\" by one of his doctors) for anyone who has the residual passive belief that Mao stood for the people and did a lot of great things for China.  Just remember, we have since found out how many of the statistics swallowed whole about the glories of the Soviet Union were complete fictions.  Yet, the statistics put out by Mao's China are still used in justifying and \\"balancing\\" the horrors he visited upon a quarter of the world's people.  We must accept that those statistics are almost certainly lies of the same sort.<br /><br />Read this book.  And read other books on Mao.  No matter how you end up balancing things, it is clear that Mao was more monster than hero.  That he viewed his own foolish and cruel ambitions as synonymous with what was best for China.  That isn't leadership; it is mental illness and personality disorder grown to a level of great criminality.sting effects (as does any major injury).

1400032717|2.0|He had it right, but over did it. I don't care how many Aspies he's spoken with, they aren't freaks like he makes Christopher seem to be at times.     I read it, attended the panel discussion at school on it, then donated it to the school library. I think it was over-hyped, probably because it was supposedly the first of it's kind. Just as a man can't write a book on how it is to be pregnant, an NT shouldn't try writing a book on how it is to be an Aspy.    Oops!    NT = (N)eurotypical (T)hinker. Aspy term for everyone else.    Aspy = Person with Asperger Syndrome. Supposedly the main character in the story has Asperger's. But...
0385043805|5.0|Having been captivated by Hitchcocks handling of this book in the movie by the name, I was anxious to read Du Maurier's writing that inspired the film. A haunting tale of of a young woman who is swept away by Max de Winter a not so long widower who is the master of Manderly that beautiful seaside estate, and the secrets it holds. The new young bride soon finds herself intwined in a web of mystery and suspense. Classic gothic writing at its best. Du Maurier's writing style is superb and never fails to hold the readers interest. This is the the first of her novels I have read, and may I say it will not be the last.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I may be the only person in the world to not like the 1995 BBC version of P&P. I was cringing inside right before I started watching this one terrified they were going to butcher Austen's language like that adaptation. But I was pleasantly surprised to hear the good old words I know and love. The screenplay is wonderful. Thank you, thank you, thank you! They have chopped out a lot of scenes from the book and shortened a lot of speeches, but what they have retained is mostly verbatim and/or sounds just like Austen and will not offend.    What else is there to say? Everything about it is fantastic. Music, acting, direction. As an art historian, I was especially enraptured with the cinematography, scenery and use of art. It was amazing. I love the genre scenes around her house with the hay bales, man with pipe, pigs.    This is without a doubt the sexiest P&P I've ever seen. Its all about the passions that are exploding beneath the surface. Matthew MacFadyen is especially good at conveying this.     Notice what the director does with the theme of eyes and looking. Jane says, \\"One of these days someone is going to catch your eye and then you'll have to watch your tongue!\\" In the very next scene Darcy appears and when he's walking down the room at the first ball he does the smallest of double takes when he sees her. Its all about the glances towards and away from each other. Keira is wonderful with her eyes, especially in the last scene.    Brenda Blethyn = hilarious. The best Mrs. Bennett I've seen. Rosamund Pike = perfect. Keira Knightly = brilliant. I liked Donald Sutherland, but please. That was not the Mr. Bennet. They've sweetened him to a ridiculous degree. Doesn't bother me, but its a flagrant departure from the book. I greatly missed Elizabeth and Darcy sparring at Netherfield. \\"Your defect is a propensity to hate everybody!\\" That was the only scene that I really did miss, though, and they cut out a lot. Otherwise I hardly noticed it. Best scene = the \\"car crash\\" proposal in the thunderstorm.    This is a gorgeous, romantic film. Absolutely loved it.
0684800713|3.0|Author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) burst into fame with this 1926 novel about U.S. ex-patriots living and partying in post-war Paris during the 1920's. Hemingway captures the feel of that city and the \\"in\\" crowd that partied there.  The story is told by narrator Jake Barnes, an American whose mysterious wound from the war (World War One) has left him sexually incapable.  This makes forever unattainable the British object of his affections, chic and lovely Brett.  Others in the clique include Brett's drunken fianc Mike Campbell, her angry ex-lover Robert Cohn, and sardonic novelist Bill Gorton. These characters hang together and enjoy themselves, despite disillusionment, alienation and longing - not too mention rather empty lives and a sad fixation with alcohol.  Even their playful trip to Pamplona to watch the Spanish bullfights feels like a competing mix of good times and escape.   <br /> <br />Despite Hemingway's crisp prose this is an over-rated novel, and far from the author's top efforts like FAREWELL TO ARMS and OLD MAN AND THE SEA. Still, Hemingway was on his way, and he joined James Thurber, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, William L. Shirer, Gertrude Stein and Kay Boyle as talented U.S. writers who spent much time in Paris during the 1920's.    <br />

B00005214X|5.0|Being a longtime McCartney fan, I have for years failed to get George's All Things Must Pass on CD.  After recently purchasing it, I can only say that I regret waiting so long.    It's clear that right from the start, the brilliance of George as an understated singer and songwriter are exposed, in the wonderful \\"I'd Have You Anytime,\\" which segues right into one of the biggest solo songs of any of the ex-Beatles, \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" which after all these years, still sounds great.  The album really never lets up from this point, with particular highlights coming in the majestic \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" (I prefer version 2), the title track itself, the rocking \\"What Is Life,\\" which features one of George's great guitar licks, \\"Wah-Wah,\\" written during the last days of The Beatles regarding his headaches with the antics of Paul/John & Yoko at that time, the stunning \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" the countrified \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" (inspired by Bob Dylan), the moody \\"Let It Down,\\" the haunting \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\" and a collaboration with Bob Dylan, \\"If Not For You.\\"      The bottom line: free from the overpowering duo of Lennon & McCartney, Harrison is finally allowed to open up his vault of songs that were being kept down (sometimes ever so diplomatically and sometimes not) by John and Paul during the waning days of The Beatles.  \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" for instance, was rehearsed during the Let It Be album sessions, along with \\"Isn't It A Pity,\\" \\"Let It Down\\" and \\"Hear Me Lord.\\" (On a sidenote, Paul performed \\"All Things Must Pass\\" lovingly with Ringo on drums at the memorial Concert For George in 2002.)      This 2001 remastered edition box comes with an informative booklet, featuring a lengthy introduction by George himself.  The lyrics have been reprinted and the artwork on the cardboard CD sleeves inside the box feature an 'update' of the original cover art for All Things Must Pass.  This revised design is a cynical nod to the present day and remainstrue to George's sometimes biting sense of humor.     Otherwise, George's personality is all over this album, from his mysticism and faith, his solid and spiritual songwriting, his awesome guitar work, and his gift for a haunting melody. If you are afraid (as I've heard some can be if not familiar with this album) that the songs found on All Things Must Pass are experimental Indian music that George favored at times, or feature songs that are preachy and overbearing (which could describe some of Harrison's mid-'70s material), don't be---this album is one you will listen to again and again.  Thanks, George.

0486408434|2.0|I'm having fun with this book, but at the same time i get extremely frustrated with it!  i love doing the tricks, but some (about 1/4) instructions are just written very poorly, then i give up on that trick :(   <br /> <br />i'm needing to read some tricks over and over to understand the mechanics of it (not becuase the trick is hard to do, but because i can't figure out exactly WHAT TO DO, becuase the instructions are unclear, and the english is funky)  i recommend the a newer version of this book which might have better english.   GET THE NEWER ONE!
B00003CXA2|5.0|forrest gump has got to be one of the best movie's of all time! it says it for itself. just watch the movie, and you too, will be moved. it's both funny and very emotional(especially when jenny dies and forrest's mommy). my fav. part is when forrest talks with forrest jr. at the bus stop. haley joel osment and tom hanks are so cute for their roles. tom hanks was BORN to play as Forrest Gump!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Where to begin myself? Well, first off, perceptions regarding fashion derived from the book would be almost nil. Austen is known for not being overly descriptive on such things. Secondly, social mores for the Regency period are usually not well served by most costume pieces.    The Regency was dirty, it was smelly, and although there was certainly the veneer of politeness and decorum, underneath was lust, debauchery and gluttony...The reality was far grittier and less pretty than what's presented onscreen or even in Austen's novels    1)Re: Bingley entering the bedroom: He confined himself to the anteroom adjoining the bedchamber. This wasn't considered too over the top as long as there was some sort of chaperone there, aka Lizzie. Did it bother anyone when Captain Brandon ACTUALLY WENT INTO the bedroom of Kate Winslet in \\"Sense and Sensibility?\\"    2) Clothing and Hair: \\"English Women's Clothing in the Nineteenth Century\\" by C Willett Cunnington explains fashion for every year of that century, and it justifies the look for the Bennet family just fine. In addition here's a quote from the book since many are dissing Lizzie's hair alot regarding the hair trends of 1800(just three years after the movie is set in):\\" \\"The front hair is combed forward on to the forehead and parted in full ringlets, or worn dishevelled. Or cropped short; or 'highly frizzed in the front and turned up behind.'\\" Dishevelled being the key word.    So, I think before others criticize what they perceive as inaccurate Regency period dress and hair and social codes, it's important to realize how large a spectrum there was for various trends and behaviors for this time period-just like our own period today! AND that modern miniseries and movies are not always the best standard to judge accuracy by.    Oh, and yes-loved the movie. A more realistic portrayal that isn't so picturesque, and a nice tribute to the original work at hand.    PS-re: Cheesy Ending: That ending was tacked on for American audiences only-everywhere else in the world basically didn't get that ending! Basically the distributors over here in the states wanted a kissy-kissy ending to make it more appealing to us yanks. As the director mentioned, it seems we Americans like a \\"little more sugar in [our] champagne.\\" The director and actors actually do not prefer this ending either....
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|I have never been one to enjoy sports movies, so I hesitated to watch it when my friend rented it...but since I'm a HUGE (and I mean HUGE) Adam Sandler fan, I decided to watch it... man am I glad I decided to!!! It was so awesome and incredibly funny!!! Two thumbs way, way up! I can't wait to go buy it!<br /><br />Chris Rock definitely upped the comedy for this movie.<br /><br />Also Recommended: Anchorman, Bad Santa, Old School
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  I'm glad to finally see the movie writers for Batman get something right.  The first and second Michael Keaton Movies were good, however, Batman Forever (#3) and Batman and Robin #4 were the worst Batman movies ever.  This new Batman release, (Batman Begins) is the best Batman movie yet.  Up to ten times better than the Keaton movies!!! I highly suggest buying the wide-screen 2 disc special edition like I did.  The second disc is chock-full of goodies any DC comic book fan would enjoy.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Boy, was 2005 a good year for gay movies, or what??!! Transamerica is the story of a very compassionate transsexual, Bree (played by Felicity Huffman) that finds out on the eve of her gender surgery that she fathered a son, 17 years prior. Her therapist won't sign off on her operation until she makes peace with her prior demons. So is the tale of Transamerica...     Felicity Huffman deserves to win the Oscar. She was funny, entertaining, and very convincing playing Bree, the very determined pre-op female. Bree is not the \\"stereotypical transsexual\\" that bigots like society to believe in. Aside from the physical plumbing, Bree is no different from any other moralistic lady. The character of the very persecuted Toby (played by Kevin Zegers) was enthralling because he had many dimensions. When he tried to seduce Bree I couldn't help but think he was a poor lost soul that needed a lot of guidance and help. But Bree never judged him, probably because she first knew what it felt like to be judged unmercifully. Bree is both an excellent mother, and father.     I picked up this soundtrack prior to seeing this movie because I LOVE the theme song by Dolly Parton, \\"Travelin Thru.\\" This song wraps up the entire movie in a nutshell and I strongly recommend getting the CD if you enjoyed the movie, or if you enjoy Dolly.     This movie is very funny, somewhat sad, but light-hearted at the same time. And, I really love how it ended. And I think both Bree and Toby finally were able to find some happiness within themselves. It was a happy ending!!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I felt that all of the Harry Potter movies have partained to the books very well. And you have to admit that some people just like this movie for the amazing actors,special effects, and the witty story plot that keeps viewers pleading for more! I do hope that Warner Bros. continues to make these magnificent movies untill the end of the series!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Why people are attempting to compare a miniseries for the medium of television to a cinematic treatment? The movie should be judged on it's merits in regards to THE NOVEL it comes from---not from another adaption! And this is coming from a diehard BBC adaption fan-I have the VHS set AND the DVD set AND the special edition DVD set! <br /> <br />And it passes with flying colors when you figure it must tell it's story economically and in a compacted timeframe. How cinematic storytelling is somehow \\"primitive\\" to the tele-storytelling is beyond me. <br /> <br />As for the numerous complaints about pigs. Mr. Bennet was a gentleman farmer-it's right there IN THE NOVEL. The pig in the movie was not in the house. Did anyone get their knickers in a pinch similarly when the '95 version showed no signs of a farm by any chance? Where were the accuracy police for that one? <br /> <br />As for fashions---Miss Bingley's sleeveless dress was illustrating how she was at the height of fashion---since sleeveless dresses were at the height at that time due to Russian fashion influences actually. Families tended to use hand me down dresses that were then altered as well-so that's why the Bennets dresses could look a little off and even have several styles layered on them at the same time!
B00006WKSZ|5.0|...if you are more into the hard rock thing as opposed to the power ballad '80s type thing. There ARE some great ballads, as with all Scorpions CDs, but when it comes to hard rock, this is cream of the crop (as are \\"Strangers In the Night\\" by UFO and \\"One For The Road\\" by the Kinks, both of which also include lovely ballads...). <br /> <br />Indeed, if you must have \\"Polar Nights\\", (and it IS a great Uli song), purchase \\"Taken By Force\\" (remaster) and ALSO get a good version of \\"Suspender Love\\" (studio). While \\"Virgin Killer\\" is their greatest studio CD, by far, \\"Taken By Force\\" is good, especially with \\"Polar Nights\\" to round out \\"Tokyo Tapes\\". <br /> <br />'Nuff said, \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" is the ultimate Scorpions CD, with great performances from every member of the band, AND ALSO one of the greatest audiences ever captured on CD. They loved the Scorpions, and so will you, once you listen to this CD a few times, and perhaps if they tour again, who knows? WAKE UP CALL: The Scorpions should tour with Rudolph, Mattias, AND Uli on guitars, and have UFO open with 2 hours of their finest, featuring, of course, Michael Schenker. THAT would be 4+ hours of the greatest hard rock ever. \\"Steamrock fever, in Tokyo Bay!\\" Dig it, it's great!!! (Then buy \\"Virgin Killer\\" it's a must). Please read other Scorpions reviews for the history and personnel of the band, and for song-by-song analyses. I generally either like a CD in its entirety, or I don't. \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" and \\"Virgin Killer\\" are CDs I can always listen to beginning to end and love every song.
0307263118|3.0|I was disappointed by this effort.  While Banville is clearly a talented author with an ability to craft exquisite sentences, In The Sea he got caught up in the craftsmanship of his prose and forgot about things like character development and plot.  His prose though beautiful was too wordy and could have stood some editing.  The main character, Max Morden, was unlikable and uninteresting despite his loss and no other characters were developed.  Finally, the plot itself was clich.  Indeed, Banville himself sums up the book best when he writes near the end of the book, \\"And indeed nothing had happened, a momentous nothing, just another of the world's shrugs of indifference.\\"  Nothing happens in this book and no one changes.  It's literary candy without much substance.  Banville was indifferent.
B0000931QA|5.0|I absolutely love 'Operation: Mindcrime.' It is, by far, one of the greatest concept albums. Queensrche has a unique sound thanks, in part, to Geoff Tate's 4-octave vocal range and the DeGarmo/Wilton combination. Buy it.
B0000062FL|5.0|Carlos Santana gained fame at Woodstock and he has never looked back. <br />Abraxas was his second album after their debut album entitled Santana. <br />This album to this day in my mind is his best ever. Abraxas showcases Santana at his very finest. <br />Santana was the first to combine Rock with a Latino Rythm section. Many groups followed suit including the Rolling Stones. <br />Abraxas has Black Magic Woman and Oye Como Va which both went on to be major hits and received considerable radio time. <br />There are other gems including Samba Pa Ti and Hope You're Feeling better. <br />This is not just for Santana fans but classic Rock fans as well and remains one of the classic albums of all time......

0312983867|1.0|I love Stephanie Plum series and was anxiously looking forward to reading Hard Eight.  To me, the hallmark of the first seven books of the series (to varying degrees), was Evanovich's light-hearted humor that made me laugh out loud.  Hard Eight was a disappointment - the familiar, and by now well-loved main characters are all there, but the book certainly doesn't read like it was written by the same author.  It is neither light-hearted nor funny. <br /> <br />To be honest, I'm surprised how much I disliked it.  Not only it wasn't funny - it really creeped me out! <br /> <br />Snakes in the apartment, tarantulas in the car and even dead people, drained of all blood, sawed in half and carried into Stephanie's apartment could still probably fit into the funny mold of Plum mysteries.  Hey, I can see that.  But the repeated appearance of the main bad guy, a true sadist, an eerie character with \\"no soul\\" and every intention to torture before killing, complete with lengthy descriptions of how much he enjoys it ..... brrrrrr.  Too close for comfort for me in a book I expected to be a light beach read.  After all, I bought the book because I expected a laugh out loud bumbling bounty hunter entertainment, and wasn't planning to have a Silence of Lambs experience.  I kind of got the later, no laugh out loud here for me.  Did I mention I finished reading it several days ago and I'm still creeped out?   <br /> <br />Hopefully this is just a fluke and the 9th book of the series will be nice, light and funny again, but I really wish someone would have warned me that Hard Eight is nothing like the first 7 Stephanie Plum novels.
B000BTC5LW|1.0|The beauty of life is that there is so much to enjoy, and that beauty is not diminished one iota by the absence of this DVD. Stop waiting for it, don't allow the EMI clowns the power to continue teasing you. This DVD has already caused more anxiety than any enjoyment it may some day bring. Forget about it and you will be a happier person.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Others have submitted long and drawn out reviews...I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  Discovered this in college and over a decade later it is still one of the my favorite discs.  If it were a tape or a record it would be worn down.  Some tunes are soft others are loud and sharp but they are all classic.  Tom's voice might not be the smooth sound of his earlier stuff but his adventures in lyrics and sounds more than make up for it.  Enjoy it.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|When it comes to King Kong, the movie is well, the King. Peter Jackson's flair for the dramatic and his detalied action secquences are top notch. Obvoisly, the gigantic ape was CG, but the way it interacted with the imcomprable Naomi Watts was superb.  <br /> <br />Though the movie differed in certain areas from the original, it has only made the movie better in my opinion. The fact that Kong and Watts had a connection, as wierd as it may sound, worked! In the original, the blonde bombshell was more afraid of the beast then she was in this version. The story was somewhat in context of a beauty and the beast kind of setting. <br /> <br />The scale and granduer used by Peter Jackson is amazing. I put him higher then good old Spielberg, Ron Howard, and put him more on the level of George Lucas. It sounds odd, but Jackson has the LOTR trilogy under his belt along with 11 Oscars. :) This film will surely fill his mantle if not full already. <br /> <br />Once again, Watts was amazing. The way she depicted a struggling actress was flawless. She, in this version, was actually part of a somewhat love triangle with herself, Kong, and Driscoll (played by Adrian Brody), and she pulled it off. Mind you her choice at the end was easy, but still. The fact that she actually in my opinion, knew what Kong was trying to do as far protect her, and the fact that she cared in this movie made it leaps and bounds better then the original. THe little hand signals, the looks, everything was perfect and really caught the mood of the movie. Even towards the end when Kong was being bombarded, he cared more about Anne (Watts), then he did himself. This love story, as odd as it may be, is original, and awesome. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson took this timeless classic, put a spin on it, and made it an epic tragedy/love story/adventure. When people talk about King Kong as a classic, they will undoubtably be talking about this movie. I personally saw it 3 times in the theatre, it was that good. <br /><br />The best part about having it on DVD, is that even though the movie is quite long (a little over 3 hours), you can pause it so you don't miss a beat. <br /> <br />This movie can be summed up in one word... GREAT!
B0009VRHLK|2.0|I was gonna write a really condescending review of this movie. The film's first hour inspires mostly derision from the vewier: see man drive, see man park, see man drive some more, with occasional awkward conversations with strange women and a prostitute. The last 30 minutes, however, are undeniably powerful and disturbing. We finally get an answer as to why Vince Gallo's character is so screwed up. If only the previous 60 minutes were as good. So, The Brown Bunny is not terrible. But it is tedious and unfulfilling. Even after the almost 30 minute cut that separates the Cannes Film Festival version from this one, the movie still feels about 25 minutes too long. The Brown Bunny could pass as an interesting, 45 minute student film at NYU or USC. But for an experienced director, Gallo should be better at polishing, driving the narrative, and fleshing out his characters. Even the most avid and patient of film buffs will want to fast forward through parts of the Brown Bunny. And that ain't good.
6305076995|3.0|The movie is definitly a good reproduction of the actual concert...as I actually saw the live show at the time. If you are looking for updated technology and sound...not going to find it here. Yes was, and still is very unique in the Rock world...very talented musicians playing complex pieces. Concert sound reproduction was not even close to the digital world of today, and the movie sound is very close to what it was like then. Video graphics also have the same dated feel. The movie accuratly shows Yes as they were in 1972. The music is excellent, if one is listening with the realities of the time in mind. I enjoyed seeing it very much, and gained new appreciation of just how avante garde Yes really was, and how risky their music was way back then.  <br /> <br />The stage show was incredible at the time- no one had attempted to create mood and image blending sound with the limited stage effects one could use with light and fog. Tame by todays standards, it's hard to remember that special effects basically did not exist then.  <br /> <br />So...if you are a fan of Yes, especially one old enough to have seen them during their rise to world fame- this is an essential \\"must have\\". For newer fans that want to see one of the concert tours that re shaped the way bands thought about stage performances for years to come- also of interest. For those that have to be critical about nuance and production values, or need to find fault in technical effects...you'll love this, because you can revel in your deep knowledge of stuff that completly misses the point. Lots to be critical about on that level. <br /> <br />Yes is still performing some of the same songs today, with the digital clarity we have come to expect. Over 30 years later, still with millions of fans, and playing music that has stood the test of time. There are very few bands that have been touring together for 35 years! When \\"Yessongs\\" is viewed within that context, I'm confident you'll enjoy it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This was the first Radiohead album I ever heard. The experience felt a bit like being a sixth grader suddenly thrown into Trigonometry class. But I caught up. Simply put, OK Computer is the best album of the 1990s. Sorry, Nirvana. If you like rock primitivism, Radiohead is not for you. Rather, its quasi-proggishness makes prog safe for people who don't like prog (if you are so inclined). The best track is \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\\" an existential space rock number that swirls and builds like a storm. It's a mini-space opera, the title of which is a pun on a Dylan song; it explodes in the middle with guitar riffs and drum fills reminiscent of the Who's \\"Naked Eye.\\" If Radiohead has a failing, it's that the band's music is not exactly cheerful. However, it is challenging, imaginative, and rewarding.

I liked this as much as the book and do not listen to anyone who says that the stupid remake is better because the remake sucked and anyone who thought it was better than this is a craphead (the remake was going to be a frickin tv series for gosh's sake). Buy yourself a copy.

B000E1YVZU|3.0|I do not like to be one of those critics that immediately denounces this film because of the popularity surrounding the Broadway hit.  I hope that with this review I do not sound like it, but there were some harsh occurrences that I cannot \\"let slide\\", while others say they were \\"golden\\".  There is a very big difference between this film version and that which I saw on stage. Sure, I didn't see the one in New York City (enjoyed the one in London), but there is something unique, absolute, and powerful about seeing a stage version of a musical instead of in the comfort of your own couch.  I don't believe that I am saying this, but I think that you have more originality on stage.  Imagination is your greatest tool, and you can also take certain justices when performing in front of a live audience that you cannot in cinema.  This was a big hurdle to have to cross with the film version of Rent.  Again, I don't want to just compare and contrast the film to play, but there was a level of imagination and originality lost in the cinematic version.  Instead of dreaming of what New York City was like on stage, director Chris Columbus spoon-feeds it to you.  You could literally turn off your mind for this film and still find some slivers of entertainment, but was it the right entertainment?  The music was phenomenal, it was impressive to see the original cast (of which I have listened to their original Broadway CD for years now), and there was some interesting points that Columbus chose to keep, and others that he chose to delete.  You cannot recreate the imagination of the theater with a film.  Shocked to hear myself say that, but it is true.  There is something about smelling the person next to you and \\"Mooing\\" with the tourist on the other side.  That is was I missed the most about Rent the film.<br /><br />Again (and I apologize), but much like the play I loved the beginning of Rent.  I initially felt that Columbus was going to successfully pull it off.  He was going to bring back the age-old cinema trick of bringing original casts back together to film on a bigger scale.  Opening with our entire cast singing the powerful \\"Seasons of Love\\" to an open stage, I nearly broke into tears at that moment.  I saw Columbus going in a very creative direction, and I must admit the opening scene pulled me in.  Then, nearly word for word, song for song, he slowly began to befuddle it.  Just like the play, for the first half of the film, I think Columbus (and the cast) did a very convincing job.  The songs provoked intimate memories, the struggle of life coupled with the power of love shined through, and the independence of living in a huge city like NYC in the late 80s was reborn.  The familiar faces of the cast and the crispness of the songs demonstrated how big this Broadway hit was.  Columbus took some creative control, which I did not complain with.  His change on \\"Tango: Maureen\\" I thought was a prediction of what he was going to do with the other songs, but alas, that creativity stopped there.  Columbus tried hard, but ultimately, after finishing this film, I do not think he was the best director to helm this project.  I didn't want Rent to be as gritty as Angels in America, yet I didn't want it to be as candy-coated as I witnessed it with Columbus.  Character's hair were never tangled or messed up, money again didn't seem to be an issue, and apparently throwing fire into the streets is not a problem in NYC.  I realize that Columbus was attempting to capture the inherit history of the musical with these scenes, but we are living in a Hollywood of realism.  Rent is a real story, I didn't want it to feel like it was \\"faked\\".  By the end of this film, I had felt that Columbus had \\"faked\\" me.<br /><br />One aspect of this film that really appealed to me was the return of the original cast.  That was a superb decision made by Columbus (and probably DeNiro) that was successfully able to keep some of the original emotion from the stage version.  Rosario Dawson annoyed me throughout the film, but outside of that I felt the original cast did a fantastic job.  I especially enjoyed Jesse L. Martin's \\"Tom Collins\\" character.  There was so much emotion, so much passion behind his eyes when he spoke that you could not help but immediately love his character.  One could say the same about Angel.  Anthony Rapp, sadly, seemed angry the entire time about something.  Even as he sang of love, his beady little eyes seemed dark and hollow.  I think he missed the aura of his character.  I, shockingly, also believed that Tracie Thoms did a fantastic job with her character, creating just enough chemistry as well as stern independence to bounce off Idina Menzel (in my opinion stole the show).  Taye Diggs, well, he was Taye Diggs.  Yet, it is due to these key players that I was able to watch this film until the end.  I do not think this film could have been done without these original players back in the roles that rocketed them into the spotlight.<br /><br />I have some friends that have seen the stage version of Rent and listened to the original Broadway cast CD and complain about this film.  It may seem like I am doing the same, but I am not complaining, just feeling a bit disappointed.  My friends claim that this film just doesn't work in today's society because of the growing awareness of AIDS and medicine's ability to combat the drug.  They also whine about the aging actors that were once in their 20s performing this same song and dance routine.  I do not agree with any of these comments at all.  This is a film/play that does not feel dated to me.  It still feels alive due to the suffering in this country surrounding AIDS.  Rent is able to do something that other films seem to continually forget to capture, and that is friendship.  Rent is about friends, no matter how old they are, always being there for you.  It is about having your own independence, while being surrounded by those that accept it.  It is about overcoming hardships with the help of these friends.  It is about living your life as if it were your last.  Rent's themes are relevant today, just as they were ten years ago.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a mediocre film release.  There could have been better moments (the ending could have been less Hollywood), yet what countered this was the music, which was phenomenal.  Columbus' idea to bring the original cast back was a bold and creative move in my eyes.  I agree that Rent should have been made into a film, but (while he had his ups and downs) I do not think Columbus was the best decision to helm this project.  I am excited that I watched this film, but I think I would rather see another staged version of Rent before I see the version on film again.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****ion.

B000A59PMO|5.0|What would you get if you crossed the beloved children's book Harriet the Spy with elements from CSI as well as any classic mystery-television program like Matlock, Murder She Wrote, and Magnum P.I. adding just a dash of youthful interjection?  Out of the bubbly cauldron you would discover a flawless television program called Veronica Mars.  Through my small knowledge of I don't think I ever picked up on the enormous originality of this program.  Perhaps I had given up on television at the time, or just didn't think that the station known as UPN could produce anything of value.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  Veronica Mars is one of the most original, creative, suspenseful, and intelligent shows out there.  While I may be basing this solely on the first season, I do not think that with the high energy of the characters, simple yet fun storylines, and edgy undertones that it will ever change.  This first season introduced me to a whole new world surrounding Neptune High and specifically the dramatic past of one Veronica Mars.<br /><br />Veronica Mars is not your typical murder/mystery television show.  This program combines one part Twin Peaks, one part After-School Special, and one part My So-Called Life with more precision and ease than I have witnessed in most Hollywood films.  We are led, adventure after adventure, by a young, energetic, and intelligent (lethal combination) amateur sleuth named Veronica Mars.  Her best friend, Lilly Kane, was just murdered and her father, the local sheriff of Neptune, blamed the wrong person.  Now, this community of Hollywood superstars, corporate presidents, and the wealthiest individuals, has shunned her family.  The worst part of it all, she has to go to school with all of their children.  We open this season with Veronica friendless, yet determined to pursue her truth and discover the real killer of her best friend.<br /><br />Coupled with a group of individuals that do not overact, seem grounded in their characters, and feel just like those you would meet in a high school setting, we spend episode after episode getting closer to the truth, while also getting closer to each one of these individuals.  This is what made this show grow on me.  By watching just one or two episodes, you see that this is going to be a decent series, but it isn't until you fully get involved into the second disc that you see the power behind our characters, story, and themes.  This is one of those rare television programs where you feel a connection with all the characters, yet trust none of them.  With Veronica solving \\"mini-mysteries\\" throughout the series while solely discovering the truth about Lilly, you cannot help but think that everyone is somehow involved.  The truth may be there, but until the final episode, you believe nothing.<br /><br />Veronica Mars works because of its minor characters and strong central character.  Veronica (played by Kristen Bell) keeps you glued to your television with her strong wit, ironclad charm, and fearless personality.  She wants the truth, and we (the audience members) find ourselves rooting for her the entire time.  This show will take you back to your high school years and make you wish that you had the brains and ability that Veronica had.  I remember watching this show and my wife saying that if it were airing when she was in school, she would see Veronica as an exceptional role model.  She would want to solve crimes/mysteries within her own school.  I am surprised that UPN hasn't publicized this series further.  For me, it was amazing to watch the great Harry Hamlin in action.  I had never seen any of his films or soap opera days, but to see him and his real-life wife in action made a new fan out of me.  With cutting edge Inspector Gadget like objects, Veronica Mars is the hero of a new generation.  Rob Thomas has successfully developed a show that would appeal to both a young and older audience and UPN is just sitting on it.<br /><br />I suggest everyone should go out and purchase this DVD now.  My wife and I zoomed through the entire first season in the course of about three days.  Even until the final episode we could not figure out the entire mystery, and the ending still left us with puzzles on our minds.  Again, this show is perfect.  Looking back I see no flaws, no errors, nothing short of pure, 100% entertainment that will both make you laugh while play with your mind.  In my eyes, Veronica Mars is flawless.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****should go out and purchase this DVD now.

B00004Y6NV|5.0|This was the very first studio album I purchased from Dire Straits. Before that, I was new to Dire Straits and I bought, the greatest hits 'Sultans of Swing 1998' and I liked the song Heavy Fuel and it was one of my favorite songs. I like it better <br />on here because it clocks in at 5:10 thus on 'Sultans of Swing 1998', it clocks in at 5:00, it's EDITED. I've only liked 2 songs <br />when I first purchased this, it was Bug, & Heavy Fuel. The year I <br />purchased this was in August 2004 and listened to it a few times, <br />great! Several months later, I listened to more songs liked a lot <br />but Heavy Fuel is still the best. Then I purchased another copy. <br />I just keep buying this new remastered CD and it's excellent. Originally released in 1991, this has been the best for 15 years. <br />Mark Knopfler makes great music. I own every of his studio albums and they are great but this is his best work. This is 5 star music so go purchase a copy today with On The Night Live, Love Over Gold, & the rest. Dire Straits ROCK!

B00005Y1UX|4.0|This is not exactly a review, more of a warning: never, and I mean never watch this movie together with your wife/girlfriend. Because if you do, inevitably you will be asked a question at some point: would you agree to take the money if you were Woody Harrelson's character? WHATEVER you answer will be WRONG. Don't want to ruin your relationship - watch this one alone.
B00004TDTO|5.0|No, I didn't just watch Jaws for the first time but I'm new to writing online reviews and I just had to review this movie. Jaws is a movie that no one will ever forget. For a 1975 movie, Jaws still remains a classic. What a great movie for the decade. As many times as I've seen Jaws, if I see it playing on t.v., I can't help but watch it again. Great acting, great special effects, great writing, great everything. There are not many movies that people talk about 31 years later, but Jaws is one of them! There are sequels to this classic but none of them can beat the original Jaws....... the movie that made you scared to go into the water!!! Excellent movie!!!!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Nicolas Cage once again demonstrates that he is one of the best actors around in his bravura performance as Yuri, a man who discovers at a young age both his talent for sales and his high tolerance for risk.  These two mix as he enters the quasi-illegal (it comes out in the very last scene of the film), highly dangerous, and insanely immoral world of providing arms to the highest bidder.  Yuri is apolitical and is able to walk away from the impact of his work on civilian populations without much more than 'it's not our war.'  He tries at one point to go legit but a visit from the Liberian president to his home persuades him that his talents are needed elsewhere.  Even the death of his brother, caused in no small measure by Yuri's own greed, is not enough for him to stop. <br />Cage is superb in this film.  It is a very dark film and will leave you thinking long after it's over.  I don't recall seeing trailers for it when it was in theatrical release but it would have been a great film to see on the big screen.
B00005T30L|4.0|Being a fan of Hocus Pocus it was kind of hard getting use to Thora Birch go from that little girl with a big mouth to this teenager with a dirty mouth but hey everybody grows up. Ghost World is just that, you don't know too many people with a life as weird as Enid's or someone that is has a best friend that is the total opposite of everything they are. And you really don't see a lot of teens that fall in love with middle-aged men that have a life revolving around old vinyl records. <br /> <br />You get a look in the life of a young girl with no life but at the same time she has a secret one that involves her dating a middle-aged loser. The loser also known as Seymour doesn't know that Enid and her friend Rebecca are playing with his head and they're only using him for comedy. Seymour is so weird and such a loser that Enid actually starts to like him for being different from the world like she is. And there's your Ghost film but somewhere it catches you and you can't stop watching it.  <br /> <br />To some people it may be boring and pointless but you have to know that HBO does play it at crazy hours in the morning and it does seem to be a better movie when your half dead. The acting is very good and I must admit that I didn't expect Thora Birch to outshine Scarlett Johansson but she played her odd character very well and that's what made the movie. The film turns into one of those stupid comedies with a dash of weird and you get a lot of laughs out of this one so it's definitely worth at least one view.
0060194995|5.0|Why not go hardback when buying this ultra-excellent timeless piece of literature?  You won't be sorry you added this to your library.  Promise!  One of the best books I've ever read....
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|**** 3.5 Stars **** <br /> <br />How to begin?   <br />   <br />I bought this movie because I truly enjoyed the novel, and then had the opportunity to purchase the BBC Production, which was beautifully told, and I thought, I have to see how they handle this in a very short (comparatively speaking) 2+ hour movie....   <br /> <br />As I watched the movie, I began to contemplate it in comparison with the great piece of literature that it is based upon, and found many discrepancies, and liberties taken....  And as I progressed through the movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it is not the retelling from the book, but rather an adaptation.   <br /> <br />However, even with that in mind, there were things I had a hard time looking past - most importantly, almost every characater, with the possible exception of Elizabeth and Darcy, were caricatures of their literary selves, everything they said and did appeared so (at times) over the top....  <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, there was definitely a more modern approach to propriety (i.e. Bingley entering the sick room, Lizzy and Darcy speaking in the morning hours in their bedclothes, Lady Catherine's night time visit, the various members of the Bennet family constantly eavesdropping whenever they can in such an uncircumspect manner, characters addressing each other by their Christian names, sleeveless dresses, etc.) <br /> <br />With the costuming, and some of the locations, there were times where I felt like I was in Colonial America and not Regency England, and the actors definitely appeared less genteel than they were intended to appear in the book....  <br /> <br />The movie can be at times very melodramatic (think of the carriage ride back to Longbourn with Aunt and Uncle Gardiner and how dark and depressing it is outside - amazing how it suits her feelings... but is it really necessary?). And, can ANYBODY tell me what was up with that tree that Lizzy, her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner stopped at to rest while the carriage was being worked on prior to going to Pemberly?  <br /> <br />Having thus laid out some of my obstacles with this movie, I have to say that as an ADAPTATION from the novel, it does have its own merit...   The acting is great for the way the screenplay was written, and some of the creative things that were done, like the scene of Bingley interacting with Darcy to 'rehearse' his proposal to Jane, were fun to watch, even if it didn't 'agree' with the book. <br /> <br />I encourage all to watch this with the full knowledge that it is MERELY AN ADAPTATION of the novel, not a retelling.... It is much easier to appreciate this as its own story, separate from the book and the BBC production of 1995.  Indeed, once I got past trying to compare it with either the book or the aforementioned BBC production, it was fun and enjoyable to watch!   <br />
B000002G7G|5.0|Not only is this the best Velvet Underground Album but I would put it in the top ten greatest albums ever recorded.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|<br /> The early 80s were a time of transition in the world of rock music. VH 3 years earlier ushered in a new era of hard rock/metal with its debut, a debut that proved a band didnt need to be punk to be relevant, and they didnt need to be corporate rock or disco to be popular. <br /> <br />  VH could have done what so many rock bands do today, make the same album again and again(Creed, Staind, etc), or they could have gone way off the deep end gone \\"experimental\\" such as Pearl Jam and even Metallica did. But what VH pulled off was an album that was in many ways experimental, but had lost none of t he VH singature sound. They took their creativity to the next level, and managed to pull this off with only a few scant weeks in the studio. <br /> <br />  The album opens up with Mean Street, with an almost funky yet memorable riff, with lyrics that took a dramatic turn from VHs first 3 albums. Dirty Movies was more par for the course for VH lyrics, but again, there was no mistake that it was a VH song, despite its even more overt funk influence, Hear About it Later starts out with a clean riff, and in a way, at least for the first few seconds of the song, was a preview of the clean riffs that Eddie would use in the Hagar era, but the song ends with a sold riff. Of course, no one can forget what was probably VHs heaviest song, Unchained. So this is Love is a solid mid tempo rocker that is bass driven. <br /> <br />  All and all, and fan of hard rock/metal should buy this CD, it has hardly aged at all in the last 25 years, and sadly few bands today  can achieve this perfect mixture of the experimental and the singature sound.
1576751988|5.0|I have listened to and read several of Brian Tracy's books. There are several ideas and concepts that are repeated in all of them. This doesn't diminish their value though.  <br /> <br />Eat That Frog! focuses on becoming more productive, particularly in the workplace. Tracy uses clear and entertaining anecdotes to make his points and each strategy is self-contained - you can apply one strategy in your life without having to rely on knowledge of the others. Because of this, I found it to be a great book to read and apply to my life.  <br /> <br />Another feature is that it is a fairly quick and simple read, compared to some of his other books and other self-improvement books. You can literally read one chapter in about 15-20 minutes, then apply that aspect of your life and then dramatically improve your productivity.  <br /> <br />Some of the tips seem common sense, but as the old saying goes, \\"Common sense is not always common practice.\\" <br /> <br />In summary, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their productivity in their work or personal lives, particularly if you're looking for simple and easy to apply strategies. It is well-written, easy to read, and effective.
1563890119|5.0|Neil Gaiman's Sandman is one powerful comic. How good is it? Well it was the only book that got me reading comics again, after being absent for 10 years.     The story of course is about Dream of the Endless and his struggle to change. Though he is billions of years old, he is often cold at heart and quick to punish those that bruise his fragile ego. It isn't until he is captured and subject to cruel treatment himself, that he finally begins to change.    After his escape, Dream goes on a quest to rebuild his fallen kingdom. He is taken through the dirty streets of England,  journeys to the depths of hell and even goes against one of DC's most powerful villains ever. Unlike other comics however, this one offers depth, humor and a truly spohisticated character that knows no bounds.   Gaiman himself proves to be a master of both metaphor and myth and I regret not reading this fanatastic comic sooner.
630514415X|5.0|Two Thumbs ups.  A very motivating movie.  This movie helped me in the really world that you never give up of your dreams and work hard to get it no matter what it takes.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Lot's of folks rate this the best movie ever because of the technical virtuosity contained herein. I actually loved this movie because of the storyline. Charles Foster Kane starts out in life as a total idealist fighting for those whom are underprivileged and against those for whom society are its pawns. By the end of the film Kane has completely lost all his youthful idealism and dies a crass materialist,loveless, friendless, and hopeless - a mere shell of a man. Sure the film was a great technical achievement but the story and the acting are phenomenal, in fact, if this were not the case I wouldn't care less about the film. According to todays' standards of explosions and relentless action it would be considered a sleeper, full of talking heads. I would think today's younger crowd probably would find this film boring and stupid and perhaps that's just a reflection of todays' empty materialism and loss of values that seems ever pervasive in the West's nihilistic decline.
B000E1155E|5.0|Okay, yeah, I know. Who really gives a sh-t about the Arctic Monkeys? Oh, you mean besides the British press and the band's thousands of friends on MySpace and every hipster in tight pants who is \\"so over\\" the Killers and Interpol and Franz Ferdinand? I weasn't even going to review this. In fact I was prepared to hate it. A band with that much hype before they even have a record out can never be a good thing. British new music mag NME voted the Arctic Monkeys one of the 50 best British bands OF ALL TIME!! I'd be afraid to see numbers 51 through 100, the ones who were bumped to make room for a band who at the time had only released a single. <br /> <br />But, and it's a BIG BUT, this record is awesome. Really. It does pain me to admit it, but this is one of the best new records I've heard in ages. Wouldn't go so far as top 50 British bands ever, but sh-t man, I can't stop listening to this. Seriously, every day. <br /> <br />So what's it sound like? Well, it definitely fits comfortably right there amidst the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Maximo Park, Kaiser Chiefs, and almost just like Hot Hot Heat for that brief moment when they were really really good. Not so much channelling 'new wave' but more sort of reimagining the sound of the Fall, but where Pavement turned the Fall into ironic indie slouch rock jangle, the Arctic Monkeys twist it into some impossibly hooky dancey drunken night out at the pub. <br /> <br />Angular guitars, sort of scrape-y and edgy and scrappy and jagged, super kinetic almost funky rhythms, killer melodies, bouncy tempos, lots of shuffle and start stop jangle and roar. And killer keening vocals, a little bit whine-y, but scruffy and capable of wailing when necessary. And the most amazingly thick Scottish brogue, ya know when the word \\"scumbag\\" sounds like \\"skoooombeg\\". <br /> <br />And let's not forget the songs. By now most of you have heard the excellently titled \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\", a perfect blast of bubbly snotty bouncy dance punk. But then there's tracks like \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" with its moody sad boy intro all sweet sad vocals and minor key clean guitars that explode into a pounding kick a-- chaotic rocker, with a killer riff and a totally impossible to resist groove. And the thing is, every song on here is just as good. So while the band will probably end up disappearing, breaking up or calling it quits after this record, I mean, how impossible is it to live up to all the critical accolades (imagine being held up alongside bands like the Clash and the Jam, all before the age of 20) but for now, you might as well believe the hype.
0385484518|4.0|I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.   <br /> <br />It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's. <br /> <br />In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death.
0679422714|5.0|This book will keep you going until u reached the very last page. A MUST have!
0553208845|5.0|I truly wish I had read this book earlier on in life. I feel almost \\"jipped\\" by missing out. This is a wonderful book that definately makes you think and reflect. I'm so glad a friend mentioned it and I can't wait for my teenager to read it.
0743455967|5.0|I'm not a fan of Stephen King's novels but I am a writer of sorts so I wanted to know more of what made this man the legend that he is today...and I was fascinated with his book and felt that I connected with him so much during the course of my read that I wanted to write to him at the email address he provided in the book (but I didn't).  But who gives out their email address in a book anyway?  Or recites his favorite long list of books (that, by the way, is not about thrillers but mostly a wonderful list of great classics)?  It indicates the level of what I believe was an honest and earnest telling of his history with writing. How can you resist loving the guy when he tells you how absolutely dead flat broke he was at the time he sold his first big story.  I mean -- talk about broke!  That's enough to inspire every writer in America.  Course, this is one man with gumption and absolute staying power to hold on during those very long lean years.  And I'm not sure most of us could do that with a family in tow.  The book itself is a small part of the professor in him, going over tips for writers but the best part is his very candid overview of his life's story and how he felt his way along his amazing writing career. When I first finished reading it I thought I would have loved to be his editor to polish up the book to make it read a little more top of the line, but on reflection, it felt kind of amazing to read -- like reading someone's diary...totally undamaged by editing -- a writer's candid view of himself and his world.
B00005JOWF|2.0|First off, the writer and director of this film, Kurt Wimmer, wrote and directed Equilibrium in 2002. Equilibrium had an amazing plot somewhat between The Matrix and Fahrenheit 451. The choreography was some of the best, with awesome Gun-Fu and sword scenes. With that said, Ultraviolet was nothing like Equilibrium. <br /> <br />The movie's biggest downfall was it's unrealistic fight scenes. Sure, it's setting is in the future, but have you ever seen 20 people die in one swipe of a sword? As of last night, I have. There are countless times where Violet is surrounded by upwards of 30 men (Yes, with fully automatic guns)and she kills them all in less than two minutes - without breaking a sweat.  <br /> <br />With that put aside, the music was awesome, composed by Klaus Bedalt who also composed music for Pirates of the Carribbean. The visual effects were amazing aswell; everything has a futuristic look to it. Milla Jovovich is a great actress, and her badass attitude saves the movie from being a total dive. <br /> <br />Overall, it's movies like this that make me want to get into the Film Business.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|in my view this album is not in a class with animals, wish you were here, the wall or dark side. musically and lyrically it is like the more tedious parts of the wall without the standout ones. more of a waters solo album than a true floyd piece.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I loved Joaquin as JR Cash, perfect depiction and Reese was marvelous also.  I must admit I felt so bad for Vivian Cash though!  I hope things worked out for her later and she found some happiness.
B00011RPB0|4.0|This movie has an odd pace and a unique feel, it really works because Murray and Johansson are so appealing.  Murray gives his character some depth and Johansson gives her character that vulnerabity, that makes you fall for her as Murray does.  The Tokyo local is extremely interesting and since it is so unusual for a film to be shot on location in Japan it gives the movie a truly unique feel.  The film is paced in a slow and deliberate way, and some may feel it lags and maybe it does at times, but you always want to know how it will end, you are invested in these characters.  The ending is unusual, but it goes along with this unique film, I like the ending, it's a private moment between them and it's touching.  This is film you will either get or you won't, so it's hard to recommend, but give it a try, you might get it and if you do it will stay with you.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was 25 in 1985 and remember watching a big chunk of Live Aid on tv.  Didn't have a VCR back then, and it's been an awfully long wait to see this legendary concert - but worth it!   <br /> <br />The performance of Queen, as many have stated here, is worth the price of the entire box set.  I was fortunate to see Queen live in 1978 and have never forgotten it.  But their performance in London at Live Aid is hands down one of the most electrifying sets you'll ever see.  You will not be able to sit still.  Freddie Mercury was probably the greatest frontman ever to grace a concert stage.  He is sorely missed today. <br /> <br />Dire Straits were awesome too, and U2 as well.  For the Philly show, I'd have to say Simple Minds and Mick Jagger had the best sets.  I could have done without the Chevy Chase/Jack Nicholson introductions, because they were pretty lame.   <br /> <br />Enjoy this DVD set!  Now for the big question - when will it be released on CD?!?
020530902X|5.0|The Elements of Style is an excellent book, every student of English language should have a copy. Writing for business or leisure, can be improved by studying this little gem.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I can not say that you will love this film because it seems to depend on the person but for me this is one of my favoutites. It is not the easiest film to watch, as it has very little sound and no action scenes. It generally takes about three watches to actually follow the concept of the film and you probably still won't be sure what it said. The plot centres around philosophical questions about loss and reality. It is an unusual look into grief, what we choose to remember, what we should remember and what we really are missing and want back. <br /> <br />George Clooney has reliably delivered good films in recent years and this one though not a box office smash like Ocean's Eleven is right up there with his best. It is set on a space station revolving around a planet named Solaris where the main character is called to check unusual phenomenon. The story is told through the circumstances on the space station paralleling with his memories of earth. It is an intreiging philosophical film, which is very insightful and will leave you with lots of questions. If this is what you are looking for in a film, then definitely give it a try.
B000089QEN|1.0|Becky isn't a romantic character and there isn't a romantic ending. BECKY KILLS JOS IN THE CLOSING PAGES OF THE ACTUAL NOVEL!<br /><br />Suspend your disbelief for a moment: In the actual novel Becky connives and crushes friends and family on her odyssey to fame and fortune. She abandons her son, bullies her way in and out of society, prostitutes herself, and finally murders Jos. The whole premise of Thackeray's novel is that there are no heroes, no heroines. In fact, there are only two or three characters of good nature and they play small roles. He purposely meant it that way. In every record of interview he confirmed his intention to portray the dark side that lurks within each of us and how lives are affected when those traits are set free.<br /><br />Here's the trick; when any literary work is 70 years old, all rights of the author, family or publisher are relinquished to the public and media executives, producers and marketing directors know full well that a very small percentage of their audience actually read the classics or even read at all; so they \\"adapt\\" the world's masterpieces to appeal to the box office so that the memory of the work is lost to several generations.<br /><br />That is why movies adapted from modern novels have different titles from the books they are based on, and are qualified with the phrase \\"based on the novel `such and such.'\\"<br /><br />This silly movie is an example of the mockery that movie makers and the media have made of the world's culture, especially our own.<br /><br />Don't read or buy this silly DVD. Read the book. The book is a wonderful experience and will take a few days for a working person. This DVD will take two hours and will provide the type of empty calories that the world is becoming more and more addicted to.<br /><br />Do you really think you can manage to adapt a Thackeray novel in five hours? Absolutely not!
B000002C1V|5.0|The Final Cut, is, in my opinion, one of the best Pink Floyd albums ever, with or without Roger Waters, including Waters' solo albums. The Wall, of course, is an all time classic, this album rates right up there along with that album though. Songs such as: The Post War Dream, The Hero's Return, The Final Cut... well, actually, the entire album just plain is the best! I never tire of listening to it.  <br /> <br />As for the critics who say Waters was a tyrant, the whole band wasn't present on the album, ect.... none of that matters. What matters on this album, and Every album that matters, is this... does it move you?  In a positive way? I would have to say yes, it does. Easily in my top ten list of all time, of which Floyd has three spots.... The Wall, The Final Cut, and Dark Side Of The Moon.

B000B8QF14|4.0|I had the greatest fortune of being able to see Green Day live about a month before Bullet in a Bible came out.  And I'll tell you one thing, Green Day is one of the best bands out there live.  They have a constant energy that is echoed by their fans and it is this great energy that makes Bullet in a Bible such a great concert. <br /> <br />I wasn't bothered as much as a lot of people were by the intermxing of the interviews with the songs on the DVD, although it did take away from the continuity of the show.  But the thing I was bothered most by was the fact that their whole set list was not included and they cut some great songs such as Jaded, She, and Homecoming.  There was a brief second on the DVD where it showed their set list and I was very disappointed that they didn't include those songs as well. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the CD, but was once again let down by the extreme editing that was done to it.  A lot of the band's on-stage antics that are on the DVD that make them such a great show were cut and there was no transition between each of the songs.  The whole thing was 99% music, with hardly any talking, and that's one of the main things that make live CD's differ from the regular ones.  However I still enjoy listening to it when I'm in the mood for it because there is such a different dynamic of Green Day live that I just love. <br />Overall, if you consider yourself a Green Day fan, I'd definitely buy this album.  You definitely won't be disappointed by the band's performance.
0517123207|5.0|This is not a difficult book to read, and I would encourage readers to read the original work of Darwin.<br /><br />\\"The Origin of Species\\" is considered to be an important work in both world literature and science. An interesting aspect of the book was the pressure for Darwin to publish the book. Prior to publishing, he had spent almost 30 years developing and testing his ideas. The book is a combination of argument and debate along with descriptions of Darwin's own experiments with birds and plants, including his own cabbage garden. In short, according to Darwin, the evolution of species takes place over a long time period and is a series of random events with survival of the fitest, or what is called \\"natural selection.\\"<br /><br />Darwin was born in 1809, trained as a botanist and zoologist at Cambridge University, and made his famous trip on the H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. He was first inspired by the writings of the geologist Sir Charles Lyell. This same geologist would play an important role in pushing Darwin to publish his findings in 1856.<br /><br />Darwin -  as he writes in his book - was not working alone. He was not the first to come up with the ideas. Darwin was preceded by many before him with similar ideas. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire wrote as early as 1795 that species are \\"degenerations of the same type.\\" Lamarck was in fact the first person to suggest that \\"all species, including man, are descended from other species.\\" He published his ideas in 1801, 1809, and 1815. W.C. Wells presented a paper on human skin colors in 1813 and published his results in 1818. This was followed by The Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert published in the \\"Horticultural Transactions\\" in 1822 that \\"botanical species are only a higher and more permanent class of varieties.\\" In 1826 professor Grant \\"declares his belief that species are descendent from other species.\\" Also, Von Bush in 1836 \\"expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent species.\\" And, in 1846 M.J. d'Omalius d'Halloy  published a paper with his opinion \\"that it is more probable that new species have been produced by descent with modification than they have been separately created.\\"<br /><br />After the Beagle trip, Darwin's main pre-occupation was to prepare his five volume work \\"Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle\\" over the years 1840 - 1843. Also, he undertook a series of experiments on evolution and wrote shorter papers. But in 1856 geologist Sir Charles Lyell persuaded Darwin to take his notes and publish \\"The Origin of Species.\\" As he prepared the book, Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a manuscript with an identical or similar theory. The two men decided to present their works simultaneously to the Linnaean Society. Wallace had visited Malaysia and come up with similar conclusions to Darwin, but he had not yet prepared an impresive large book, as had Darwin.<br /><br />Darwin had been very cautious, and in the years 1840 to 1856 he had undertaken a number of experiments himself with pigeons and various plants. He had even joined two pigeon clubs and had his own garden in the country. He describes some of the slightly amusing details in the book. For example, he was able to grow over 200 varieties of cabbages by cross breeding. Among the findings, he had come to the conclusion that domestic pigeons were probably all related back to the rock-pigeon (Columba livia). He undertook a number of experiments including one where he mated two mongrel pigeons, and the resulting offspring looked like rock-pigeons.<br /><br />So, although Wallace had the same ideas at the same time, Darwin had a fifteen years accumulation of notes, observations, and his own experiments that he could put into the book. Once the book came out it was an instant best seller and Wallace was largely forgotten, along with his other predecessors. Darwin was very cautious with his findings, and the many years researching and thinking about his ideas - almost two decades - paid off for himwhen he finally released the near 700 page book.<br /><br />Darwin published a second well known book in 1871: \\"The Descent of Man.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Origin of Species\\" is a well crafted and interesting book. There are just a few figures in the book. It is an easy read, although some parts have many small details. Darwin lectures us on a variety of subjects such as flower reproduction. The heart of the book is Chapter IV: Natural Selection. He has fifteen chapters covering a range of topics including geology and fossils.<br /><br />It must be remembered that when the book came out in 1859 it was generally assumed that only God could create life. The book was revolutionary, and too detailed to refute. It was a comprehensive book and came as a major challenge to the accepted norm. At the end in the conclusion Darwin tells the reader that his findings just give a different explanation in the way \\"the Creator\\" works, and it does not imply a lack of a God.k.

B000301YY8|5.0|I heard about James Blunt from ads put on by VH1 that would roll during the ending credits of popular shows.  They showed a small clip of his music video for \\"You're Beautiful\\" and gave a little biography of his life - how he was ex-UK military and wanted to express himself in music.  His unique voice and his lyrics really struck me, so I decided to buy his CD. <br /> <br />I have not been disappointed by this CD at all, in fact I was rather impressed.  \\"You're Beautiful\\" is an absolutely mesmerizing song...as a female, it's one of the best compliments to be told you're beautiful, and so I can understand the kind of emotion he's trying to convey with this song. <br /> <br />Surprisingly, his radio hit \\"You're Beautiful\\" is not the best song on this CD (and thus should say a lot about what kind of album you should expect).  Though all of his songs are about love and (mostly) loss, they don't come out as suffocating ballads or whiny complaining.  He has a very genuine way of expressing his emotions, and it makes me believe that he wrote his songs from experience, not from dramatic poetry or something that would not be so realistic.  I respect him as an artist for that in particular. <br /> <br />According to the insert on the inside of this CD, he wrote or at least co-wrote all of the songs on this album, and, so, that makes me respect him more than a lot of the artists today as well.  He wrote the songs with his unique voice in mind, so it neither becomes overbearing or irritating...which is important considering how unusual his voice really is.  It's sort of high, slightly scratchy at times, but can stay very stable and smooth if he wants it to.  It's beautiful, but sort of in the Damien Rice way...though I feel it's a lot more listenable than Damien Rice (Damien likes to whisper a lot to get his emotions across, James Blunt just sings it like he feels it).   <br /> <br />I liked this album the first time I listened through it, but I've grown to love it more and more each time I listen to it.  It's usually something I'll listen to in the morning as I'm getting ready, or during the day to get some peace of mind, and even at night while I'm going to sleep beacuse it's gentle enough not to get you too pumped up before you want to sleep.  It's a versatile album in that each song sounds slightly different, but has enough flow to make it well rounded and within the same collection.  The emotions stay very similar from song to song, but that's not too surprising considering he's describing love and certain tragic situations. <br /> <br />I would describe his outlook on love as very idealistic, he knows love when he sees it, but also knows the reality that always controls modern-day love.  Thus, he comes off as very cynical sometimes, but not in a bitter way.  He just accepts that he cannot have all that he loves, and thus sings to tell you about it.  It's a simple style of expression, and I like that it's not complicated with complex effects.  His music is very clear and straightforward.   <br /> <br />Okie, my thoughts on a few songs: <br /> <br />1.High - great song to start off with, sets the mood of the entire album.  It's soft, but not in a sleepy way.  It describes his relationship with this magnificent person.  He's high off of her presence and loves that he is.  Knowing that he'll wake up next to her every morning is all he wants.  \\"Will you be my shoulder, when I'm grey and older, promise me tomorrow starts with you.\\"  Beautiful.  <br /> <br />2.You're Beautiful - Great song, better than the radio edit.  There is one swear word in this song (and only two on the entire album, which somehow made it so his album has the \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" warning on it, but yeah, barely detectable).  Describes the beauty of an ex-girlfriend that he sees on the subway and knows he can't have.  I appreciate the fact that even though things didn't work out between them, he still can have enough respect for her to know she's beautiful.  That takes alot sometimes. <br /> <br />3.Wisemen - My favorite song on the album.  I'm not too sure what it's about, on a whole, but the whole message seems to be \\"Look who's alone now, it's not me, it's not me...got to ask yourself the question, where are you now?\\"  It seems to me that he's talking about a girl he's with, who entranced lots of men before him, but she never let those men get her.  Thus these men are at a loss and don't know what to do because they can't have her.  That sort of thing.  Open to interpretation I think. <br /> <br />I hope you check out this album and enjoy it as much as I have and will continue to.  Absolutely fantastic new arist - one of the best released last year I feel.
B0000CDL93|5.0|While many may disagree with the theories presented in this film, this is a well researched movie, and skillfully put together. Based on the investigation of Jim Garrison, the former-New Orleans District Attorney, and author of \\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" (basis for the movie), it walks through a great many of the questions still remaining in one of the greatest crimes committed in the 20th century. Many may judge Stone's thesis, however, he should be able to present his own theories. After all, the federal government presented the American people with one of the greatest lies of all time: the Warren Report. This film deserves much attention, and anybody who tells you otherwise does not know what the are talking about. Before watching this film, I do recommend that you read some books about it, because it may be quite confusing if you have no knowledge on the case. I recommend \\"Crossfire\\" by Jim Marrs, which is another of the basis for the movie, however, it goes into the great historical aspect of the entire case, the theories, and the roles of individuals. I believe you will find that this is one of Oliver Stone's best films.
0684824906|5.0|The genius of Abraham Lincoln shines through every poage of this book.....his ability to work with and through both friends and enemies and to withstand every trial, catastrophy, insult, yet remain calm, steadfast and kind throughout his administration.  Most importantly, Abraham Lincoln was driven to preserve the Union...the world's first great experiment of the ability of men to govern themselves.  Doris Goodwin has made a valuable contribution in this timely book which illustrates how Government should and could be run. <br />
B000CBSHK2|5.0|Beth Orton <br />Comfort of Strangers <br />Astralwerks <br /> <br />Full of pop melodies and tales of lost love, Beth Orton's Comfort of Strangers is equally influenced by Joni Mitchell's fetching folk, Christine McVie's late `70s blues-infused pop, and Dusty Springfield's blue-eyed soul. Imbued with sadness and hope, Comfort of Strangers finds Orton using religious imagery and subtle political rhetoric, while spinning a web of minimalist musical bliss, often complimenting her edgy Cockney alto vocals with only acoustic guitar, piano, bass, and percussion. <br /> <br />Nowhere is this more apparent than the opening track, \\"Worms.\\" A rollicking piano pop chantey, \\"Worms\\" is a tale of tarnished love in which Orton goes from being someone's beloved to being a fallen woman. \\"Now, I'm your apple-eating heathen/the original sin/well you ain't got my faith/so best keep your belief,\\" she croons in the chorus. Elsewhere, she becomes a \\"rib stealing Eve\\" - a clue that the song is as much about male chauvinism as it is about a love affair gone bad. <br /> <br />The following song, \\"Countenance,\\" continues the religious themes, while adding political undertones to the mix. \\"For those who preach forgiveness/while they're practicing revenge/man will do to man/but nature's got it all in hand,\\" she begins the song about finding herself in the midst of hypocrites who believe they can hide their sins from nature and God. Orton's message is one of karmic retribution for those who perpetuate violence and perpetrate crimes against other human beings. <br /> <br />\\"Conceived\\" is the album's true standout track, however. On the surface, \\"Conceived\\" is another story of misplaced love that also encompasses Orton's world view. \\"Didn't ask to be conceived/in a loveless embrace/still we learn to be a warm sun/round a very cold galaxy,\\" she sings over a tender acoustic melody and strings. Orton's melancholic hopefulness and existentialist angst reaches it's apex with these lines. \\"Shopping Trolley\\" is likewise a high point for Orton, an expression of both dejection and faith. \\"I think I'm gonna cry/but I'm gonna laugh about it/all in time,\\" she wails over a rollicking drum and electric guitar tune that belies the song's sobering lyrics. <br /> <br />Comfort of Strangers closes with two quite disparate songs - the funky up-tempo \\"Heart of Soul\\" and the somber piano ballad \\"Pieces of Sky.\\" The former is a plea for more love in the world, while the latter is an affirmation that life must go on in the face of tragedy, that death and sorrow are inevitable parts of life. \\"And how do you know how much you'll be missed?/Does it add up to some names on a list?/Do you know we're just pieces of sky/pieces of sky that keep drifting by?\\" she asks. For Orton, the answers seems lie in faith and struggle, in love and life. <br /> <br />Possessing both pop sheen and musical minimalism, Comfort of Strangers is a lyrical journey into Beth Orton's personal landscape, encompassing love and heartbreak, politics and humanity, life and loss. <br /> <br />- Tracy M. Rogers <br /> <br /> <br /> 2006
0552998877|5.0|This book is fun..I mean great fun and not just the girlish giggle type of fun but the LAUGH OUT LOUD fun. Its THAT good! It got me hooked on Sophie Kinsella.I have now all her books in my shelf and can't wait for her to write more!<br /><br />This book, first of all, is the same book known as \\"COnfessions of a Shopaholic \\".(just a different title) I dont know why it has two different titles but anyway...<br /><br />I have started reading humourous chick-lit after I read the two Bridget Jones Diaries. To be honest I was sure I wouldnt find a funnier book than those two but, happily, i found i was wrong :)<br /><br />Kinsella has the touch. I've read \\"Can You keep a Secret?\\" and the first two of the Shopaholic books and I'm still craving for more. (thankfully i still got \\"Shopaholic ties the knot\\" and \\"shopaholic & sister\\" to keep me going)<br /><br />This is a book for those people who want to have a good, healthy laugh, who want to forget for a while the worries and troubles of everyday life. Yes Rebecca Bloomwood has no sense as regards to her personal finance . Yes she becomes totally and irrevocably irresponsible as soon as  enters into a shopping mall. But heck, this is what makes the book such fun. We can actually feel good about ourselves because we can never be as bad as her....(some of us at least ;)<br /><br />Her replies to the letters she recieves from her exasperated Bank are hilarious and equally so her reasonings that actually when she is spending she is in fact investing. Her attempts to control her spending are so funny I couldn't stop laughing. The Curry recipe part is really incredibly funny....<br /><br />I think that most females will find themselves in Rebecca. I bet most of us have thought once or twice on the same lines as  Rebecca does when she tries to excuse one of her mad urges for an expensive but not so practical item.<br /><br />All i can say more is go on an read it a perfect light book with humour and also a dash of romance which will warm your heart like whiskey  ;)
B000B5UL7G|5.0|This album is excellent! Along with my all time Robbie's favourite \\"Escapology\\" (I like the US version more than the EU one), I can't stop playing it. <br />See you on tour in Ireland next summer, Mr Williams! <br />You're really the world's most handsome artist.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|What is really disturbing about most of those that have posted low ratings is they have not been there and have no IDEA behind the concept of \\"Hurry up and wait!\\" And yes most all service men are silly and immature. Why?, ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL KIDS!!!!! I know, I once was one of them during the first Gulf War. You may be told 3 times during one night to be ready to advance anyminute, only to be told to dig your \\"Ranger Grave\\" 5 minutes later, then after you get it finished ready to settle in for the night, you are told be ready to advance in 5 minutes. Then all you do is advance 10 kilometers and be told to dig in again. Over, and over...hurry up and wait.

0767818040|3.0|Body Double is one of those films you'll have to see to believe, but once you do you'll have no trouble believing that Brian De Palma was the man behind the camera.  The so called \\"master of the erotic thriller\\" followed up two of his best films (Dressed to Kill and Blow Out) with this lurid thriller, in which Craig Wasson plays a down on his luck struggling actor who becomes an unwitting witness to the murder of a beautiful neighbor who enjoys taking her clothes off and dancing with her curtains up.  Melanie Griffith is here as well, playing a porn star that teams up (more or less) with Wasson as he delves into the world of pornography and prepares for the performance of a lifetime.  For one thing, even if you're a die hard De Palma fan, Body Double is one of those films you'll either love or hate.  For what it's worth, the cast is great, and the stalking scenes are fantastically filmed with nods to Hitchcock as well as the classic museum scene from Dressed to Kill.  Like De Palma's best films, Body Double isn't for everybody, but if you're looking for a deliberately trashy thriller, look no further.

B000957O82|1.0|Get out! Stop! I mean it! This is so funny! His name is Alex Hitchens, they call him Hitch, and he helps people get hitched. Stop it! That is too clever! (Yikes).<br /><br />The best thing you can say about this formulaic twaddle is that it's inoffensive, which is precisely what makes it so awful. Hitch has UCLA film school screenplay written all over it, especially the knucklehead antics ensuing as doctor and client wrestle in parallel. Then comes the wildly unsurprising payout - Albert is really much more wise in the ways of love than Alex. Who saw that bombshell coming?<br /><br />What little joy there is to be milked from this ancient cow comes through the grace of lovely Allegra, Amber Valletta, and Albert, Kevin James. The character of Allegra is a preposterous concoction, but Ms. Valletta gives it authenticity, quite an achievement. As to Kevin James, this is one fine comic actor who seems completely natural and comfortable on camera. He is both gifted and skilled with a marvelous way of achieving the virtually impossible task of making comedy look easy. As far as Will Smith goes, well, it's not far enough.<br /><br />I wouldn't say Smith is incapable of acting, because I have seen him turn in credible performances. But, I would say that no one has cruised quite so effortlessly down the freeway for so long with so little gas in the tank. Frankly, Smith is likeable and non-threatening, his appeal rests in his good looks and the absolute certainty that he will never do or say anything remotely interesting or controversial.<br /><br />Let's not downplay the value provided here. In a tormented world, some folks want to take a date to the movies secure in the knowledge that every emotion they're about to experience has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. But I'm not three of them. Un-hitch the movie, I'll just watch the trailer.

B000929AJQ|3.0|This is the most accessible NIN album ever, and, very sadly, the least challenging one. Unlike the older works such as The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, the vocals are no longer buried in layers of sounds, and you can hear Trent's voice very clearly in most of the tracks. Despite of that, I can't really feel what Trent wants to say, or what he wanted to do in this album. It looks like he is torn between old and new himself.     When I heard The Hand That Feeds, the first single from With Teeth for the first time, I was a kind of surprised, and also very intrigued. He criticizes Iraq War initiated by the current US administration, and urges us to see the not-so-pretty truth. Until then, Trent's lyrics had been totally introspective, and only about how he feels. But now, he was asking \\"What do you think? What would you do?\\" The Right Where It Belongs, in my opinion, is the strongest track in the album. It makes you think about the world around you.     But in the rest of the album, the lyrics are very weak, and fell into his old clich. And even worse, flip-flop???     Sonically, there is nothing new here. It looks like Trent fell in his comfortable routine. I thought he was working with Rick Rubin. But Alan Moulder was credited as the producer instead. I don't really understand what Trent tried to create. He had done guitar-driven angry hard rock before in Broken EP. I feel like he hurried to finish this album. More than five years had passed since The Fragile was released, and he had the ongoing court case with his ex-manager then.    I'm very glad that he's now clean and sober. But it looks like getting clean didn't solve his all problems. I will continue listening to whatever he creates, but am not sure where he's going from here.
B00080ZG10|4.0|The story of Howard Hughes is a lot more exciting than I expected it to be.  The film begins with the making of the lavish spectacular 'Hell's Angels' in 1930, and continues through to Hughes's battle to preserve his TWA airline after WW2.   <br /> <br />I took a great dislike to Leonardo di Caprio in 'Titanic' which I absolutely loathed. Likewise I disliked Cate Blanchett in 'Elizabeth.  Here, however, both actors give terrific performances, Cate Blanchett is marvellous as Katherine Hepburn and diCaprio carries this very long film without once boring me.  There are excellent supporting performances too, I particularly enjoyed Alan Alda as obnoxious Senator Brewster, and Jude Law is suitably gorgeous and raffish in a cameo performance as Errol Flynn. <br /> <br />It is diCaprio's film though, and a very good film it is.
B000B0QJM2|1.0|What would you expect when you see \\"Deep Purple - Made in Japan Concert DVD\\" with the picture of the record?. Well, a DVD version (don't care about the quality) of the concert footage, I suppose... <br />WRONG!!! It's just a bunch of guys giving their opinions (who cares?????)over clips of versions of the songs not even matching the audio tracks on the L.P. But you can perfectly notice the Lord of the Media \\"Dick Clark\\" stamp on all of them. <br />I waited for decades to have the opportunity to see any version of \\"Made in Japan\\". Why do they revive the fans'hope to see this unique concert and deliver this? <br />Like the other buyer, my first feeling after watching this DVD was ANGER and FRUSTRATION.  <br />Sorry guys, this is far from being IT.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I hate test audiences.  I hate every single one of those bloodless, mindless viewers who ruin things for the rest of us.  A test audience is the only way I can explain the vast difference between the Director's Cut of Daredevil and the Daredevil in theaters.<br /><br />I love Daredevil in the theaters and when I walked out I gave it a 7 out of ten - a bit above average, and wasn't Jennifer Gardner fantastic.<br /><br />Then on a whim, I bought the Director's Cut and found the layers I was missing.<br /><br />Marvel Comics used to be known to the turns, the layers, the inner darkness of their heroes. XMen kept that, Spiderman held on tight.  But somewhere along the way, other Marvel Heroes became anemic.<br /><br />In this Daredevil, Mattie's accident is all the more tragic because we find out more about his father's work as an enforcer.<br /><br />As a lawyer, his near psychic senses are outlined even more.<br /><br />The great line of \\"Because I'm not the bad guy.\\" makes ever more sense as we see how close he gets to becoming what he truly hates.<br /><br />Bullseye is even more frightening.  As he passes through metal detectors in the airport, we see exactly how devious he is and how frighteningly well armed he is.<br /><br />The characters are given more depth and we actually are allowed to see subplots.<br /><br />I would recommend seeing both versions, though and deciding for yourself.
0553588486|5.0|I have been reading fantasy for 18 years and as my tastes matured I found it hard to find books and movies that matched my interests. That all changed when I found this book, a superb blend of medeival politics, sex, deception, and despair.<br /><br />There are no wizards here raining magefire down on enemies, or a bestiary of magical beasts laying waste to the countryside. Instead we meet several charcaters, each with his own motivations and allegiances, and the drama they face in a power struggle for the throne and it's impact on their lives.<br /><br />Martin weaves his tale by alternating viewpoints between several major characters, allowing us to live the story from all sides not simply through an indestructible protaganist. I found myself cheering for heros and villains alike, and don't grow attached to any character in the story as Martin likes to show how brutal this world can be with brutal assasinations, infantcide, and rape.<br /><br />I have recently become addicted to shows on TV like HBO's Rome, and the Sopranos for the politics and interactions of powerful characters. When the seasons ended this year I was looking around for something to fill the void, luckily I found these books. If you enjoy an epic fantasy more for it's characters than it's magic and monsters then you simply must read this book. My wife loved it as well, and she is not a Fantasy fan, but she was hooked on Rome like I was. We have spent countless hours discussing the characters in these books and what might happen in the next. The best fantasy I have read in years with out a doubt.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|Isn't it sad when noise passes for quality music? Well that's what a decent chunk of this album is. And when there is actual music it is still nothing special.

B0006399FS|5.0|Let me get one thing straight. All of the people who think that this is a \\"bad\\" U2 album, you guys are idiots and should never get to listen to U2 ever again. U2 is the most important band in the world over the last 25 years or so and in my opinion are the greatest band of all-time. This album is amazing from start to finish and it's  one of their most focused and consistent. This is one of U2's best albums and another masterpiece. The album is perhaps most impressive because of the fact that U2 has been around for almost 30 years, and are still making amazing records. The Rolling Stones haven't released anything worthwhile in over 20 years and are still relying on their old hits from decades ago. U2 deserved all 5 of their grammy awards and I can't wait for their next CD. Below is a list of the songs and my ratings.     1. Vertigo 9.5/10 (Awesome Intro)  2. Miracle Drug 10/10 (Classic U2)    3. Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own 10/10 (Great Ballad with very emotional lyrics)  4. Love and Peace or Else 7/10 (Weakest Song of the CD but not bad)    5. City of Blinding Lights - 10/10 (My favorite song on the album)     6. All Because of You 9/10    7. Man and a Woman  8/10  8. Crumbs from Your Table 9/10    9. One Step Closer - 8.5/10  10. Original of the Species 9.5/10 (Another excellent track with great vocals/lyrics by Bono.    11. Yahweh - 10/10 (One of my favorites)

B00003CXBK|5.0|I am puzzled that so many people gave this move horrible reviews. <br />in response: 1) This is ANIME, yes it is animated, but it is NOT A CARTOON. Anime is a different form of art entirely. 2) I must say that the person who said their 18yr old sister got scared of all the gore is a liar. What has come out now? Saw 1+2, Jeepers Creepers, Boogeyman, etc. (I am not a horror movie fan so i don't know many), and those hollywood gauranteed-to-make-you-scream movies can top this? Liar. Also, there really isn't too much and when there is it is tasteful, not massaive amounts everywhere just for effect. Again, There were beheadings in early Nihon (Japan) and elsewhere in the world so don't be so shocked. 3) If you are too thick to understand the stroy just don't leave a review. Honestly, how could you possibly enjoy what you cannot comprehend? Please, just go away, it's not that difficult to follow. 4) I despise all you ultra-conservative control-freak bible-hugging parents. Let your kids live their own lives and support them, not dominate them. There is no reason why a mature 12 year old should not be able to watch this movie.  <br /> <br />Anyways, the movie itself is very good. good animatio, satisfactory dubbing, good story, great soundtrack. the featurette <br />is crap however, the views expressed by the english voice actors are the kind where you can rell they're being paid to say it. <br />Enjoy.

B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth's Ghost Reveries is an album that defines what the word \\"progressive\\" truly means in the musical sense.  Opeth has been making the average music listener question their definition of beauty ever since they came onto the scene with their album, Orchid, and why would this be any different eleven years later?     I originally wrote a review for this album that was all stream-of-consciousness.  I was trying to separate preconceived notions of what an Opeth album should sound like from what my mind was truly telling me.  I listened to each track and wrote down everything I felt about the songs as they progressed through.  It may be one of the most honest reviews I've ever written... but it's not an easy read, and therefore, I decided to post a review that takes a more traditional approach though keeping in mind the lessons of my stream of consciousness review are not forgotten.       A few questions needed to be answered with Opeth's first major label album.  Let's not kid ourselves, Roadrunner is a major player now in the metal market and is a major label for a band like Opeth.  Those questions were:  Would the tone and feel of our beloved Opeth change with this new label and how was Opeth going to follow-up the much acclaimed, but acoustic driven, Damnation?     To answer those questions in order, yes and damn well!     Ghost Reveries is not a dramatic shift for Mikael Akerfeldt and company, but it is a shift nonetheless.  The addition of full-time keyboard player, Per Wiberg, while adding interesting textural difference to some songs, doesn't truly find his home in many of the more aggressive moments as much as he does in the albums softer sides.  It's hard to not appreciate what Mikael is trying to accomplish with this album-his hope to fuse eerie keyboard work with his already atmospheric darkness is laudable.  I think though, that in this venture, he falls slightly short of the mark that he has set.  Where for most artists this particular melding would have be an accomplishment, for Mikael, high expectations are abound and so the addition of a full-time keyboard player should have helped him mold entirely new atmospheric sections in an already dynamic guitar driven band.  The keyboards, in the heavier sections, become redundant.  Opeth's ability to craft darkness and melody with guitar is renowned and therefore, forces you to question the need for keyboard in those sections.       That being said, Per's keyboard work in songs like \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\", \\"Isolation Years\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Hours of Wealth\\" are irreplaceable and make his addition seem more like genius than overkill!         \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" may be the best song Opeth has ever written.  While not my favorite on the album, it's hard to deny the level of perfection this band has attained when it comes to creating mood.  Mikael is really exploring his clean melodic voice over-top of the harder sections now and this song is a major benefactor of that experimentation.  Steven Wilson fans take note; much of the melody from songs like this is heavily influenced by Mikael's work with Steven on Blackwater Park.  If you can't hear Steven singing \\"A Trail of sickness... leading to me...\\" I'm not sure we're listening to the same band!  The keyboard work during the acoustic passages of this song is subtle and necessary and is followed by a distortion driven section that has one of the better melodic leads on the album over-top of it.  If Opeth were to be the embodiment of one song, \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" would be that song.  A true masterpiece.    Directly following is the song \\"Hours of Wealth.\\"  This song is both the truest departure in sound on the album while also melding sounds from previous albums.  Per creates a wonderful atmosphere in this song with a sense of desperation and searching being echoed by the acoustic guitar.  When everything cuts out, Mikael comes in with his melodic voice, crooning in a 1950's esque style.  It's not so much the song... but it has the feel of a song that would be sung in an old jazz bar.  To me this is the most compelling song on the entire album:  It's stripped away sound, its delicate harmonies and guitar work all joined together by Per's keyboards.  No drums... Mikael lays himself out there and is in his glory on this track.  A truly unique track that see's the blending of musical decades as well as recalling the grandeur of one of Opeth's most recognizable songs, \\"To Bid You Farewell\\" (which \\"Isolation Years\\" also does a great job of doing).     While not quite as memorable or creative as Johan DeFarfalla's bass work on Morningrise, it is worth noting that this is the best bass work an Opeth album has had since then.  While we're at it, it must be pointed out that Martin Lopez is one of the best drummers in metal, period.  His growth as a drummer since his days with Amon Amarth has been ten fold and I count him among the irreplaceable pieces of this band now.    This is a stunning piece of work from a man who continues to confound classic death metal and progressive metal fans.  A genre defying force that dares you to listen and not be moved, Opeth has, yet again, crafted a force to be reckoned with.  This may be the same old Opeth to some people, but if you dig beneath the surface, the subtlety's and nuances are far from the same.  Redundant keyboard work aside, do not make the mistake of not buying this album.    For Fans of: Katatonia and Porcupine Tree
B000A59PMO|5.0|As great of a show as C.S.I. is, its formulaic method of storytelling makes it, in my opinion, just a MURDER SHE WROTE for the 21st century. Each week there's a murder, each week the murder is solved (WOW, if it were only true in real life), and each week the murders get crazier and more bizarre because after 6 seasons... they have to keep thinking up new ways to kill people. Then there's the well deserved boffo ratings.<br /><br />Which brings me to VERONICA MARS... would Veronica Mars have those kind of ratings if it were on a more widely viewed and more widely dispersed affiliate network? I'm not sure. You have to be willing to commit. The show is more like real life. The who-dunnits aren't so cut and dry.<br /><br />The star of the show Kristen Bell, plays VERONICA MARS, a seventeen year-old Nancy Drewish super-sleuth. Using everything in her power to solve small scale crimes, like finding a missing dog, or finding out who stole the money from a friendly poker game, or even going a little larger and finding missing persons or getting to the bottom of sexual harrasment charges. Yet, you care about these things as if they were the most important thing in the WORLD... because they are... to Veronica.<br /><br />All the while, Veronica, in the back of her mind is treading into areas that may very well be more than she can chew, like why her mother left them and vanished without a trace, and what she may have to do with the murder of her best friend, and the fact that the man sitting in jail for the murder of her best friend is looking more and more innocent and why the parents of her ex-boyfriend are possibly involved in the cover up, and why her ex-boyfriend may be closer to her than she ever imagined, and why she woke up in a strange bed at a party one year ago with her panties off and no recollection of how she got there.<br /><br />It's all very complex and engaging and wonderfully addicting and creative. Watching the show reminds you of how complex the world is and how murders aren't solved in one episode and that just because the T.V. tells you that a murder is solved, doesn't mean it is. Money is power, power is control and control is usually hiding something.<br /><br />Which brings me back to my original point. VERONICA MARS is probably the most intriguing, engaging and most well-written show on television, but it is hiding away on the rarely-seen UPN network... We don't have a UPN affiliate where I live... and it's not even available VIA SATELLITE... that is what makes these DVD release so fantastic.<br /><br />I wanted to watch this show so bad, so I asked for it for Christmas. My fiance watched them in 3 days... cried, laughed, gasped and cooed about how wonderful the show is. A show she had never heard of... is now her favorite show ever.<br /><br />Now that I've bought these and watched them... I can only eagerly await the season 2 DVD release... because I still can't get UPN where I live.world is and how murders aren't solved in one episode and that just because the T.V. tells you that a murder is solved, doesn't mean it is.

B00005JO1R|4.0|There was another review here that I agreed with completely. How do you TRULY tell the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter in just 2 hours. Well.... you can't. So, you take an element of their life... like, their rise to fame, or their deaths, or their romance and you tell that story.<br /><br />The makers of WALK THE LINE chose to tell the story of their romance and how it came about for them to finally marry each other. Which, in my opinion, was an excellent choice because that was the thing that defined them the most. It was the thing that drove them and made them who they were.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix captured JOHNNY CASH amazingly. Honestly, while I was watching the movie, I didn't see Joaquin Phoenix... I saw Johnny Cash. If Jamie Foxx won the Oscar in 2005 for RAY, the Joaquin should be a shoe in for 2006. He was truly amazing and should have won previously for GLADIATOR anyway.<br /><br />On the same note, Reese Witherspoon may have not captured the immitation like Joaquin did, but she captured the ESSENCE, the hesitation and Love that June had for Johnny and she is equally deserving to win.<br /><br />The film brings to light the uncontrollable hold that love has on a soul and captured some truly wondeful moments of devotion, friendship, loneliness and that sometimes, everyone needs a helping hand to get out of an abyss.<br /><br />Not to mention, captured some truly great musical performances. Joaquin Phoenix should get an oscar for the FOLSOM PRISON scene, ALONE!<br /><br />This is a true gem of a film that demonstrates that Love is like a magnet, and June and Johnny's lives were always entertwined, they just took different roads.<br /><br />The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that biopics are inheritantly boring and not as interesting as we assume the persons life actually was. We see a childhood story of hardship and death... the rise to fame... the drugs... the women... the crash... the recovery... the music... huh, Johnny Cash and Ray Charles led the same life...<br /><br />It's a wonderful movie with OSCAR calibur performances, but the rock star life has been told before.with OSCAR calibur performances, but the rock star life has been told before.
B00005JOFO|5.0|As I've read down through the numerous reviews on this movie, I have encountered a few (precious few) reviews that had thoughtful criticisms.  And I've even found myself agreeing with some of them.  I do wish there had been more affection displayed between Jack and Ennis to support the idea of them being in love.   Though I will say the 2nd tent scene, when Ennis gets up and goes into Jack was pretty tender and loving.  Still, the complaint is a valid criticism.   <br /> <br />But nearly all of the rest of the negative reviews, in my opinion, are not valid.  Too many have tried comparing the story with one about a man and a woman, saying if it were about a man and a woman, nobody would care about it.  Granted, they wouldn't.  But if a man loved a woman in 1962, it wouldn't have been a big deal, would it?  There would be no threat to their lives.  Can you see that a fair comparison isn't possible?  Can you admit that it's not?  <br /> <br />Can you understand that it is this vital difference that makes the movie important? <br /> <br />Another viewer claims there was anal rape, which is just idiotic.  This poor individual has no clue what rape means, and as a result, I doubt many will consider his review helpful. For even those who didn't like the movie would know that rape was not a part of it.  <br /> <br />Another said Gyllenhaal and Ledger's characters in the movie just wanted sex, didn't matter from who.  Is that really fair?  Gyllenhaal's character wanted to be with Ennis, who was too afraid.  And only from neglect did Jack turn to other men.  Similarly, Ennis only was intimate with his wife, and Jack.  He later took up with a waitress, but she lassoed him.  Do you think if he was so afraid of being found out he was gay, that he would dare reject her efforts?  What might that indicate about him to others?  Yet, when she finally said goodbye, you didn't see him trying to talk her out of it.  All he said was, \\"Well I was probably no fun anyhow.\\" He seemed relieved.   He had an image he felt he had to uphold for his own safety.  It doesn't mean he wanted sex, no matter who it was from.  Painting these guys as promiscuous users is totally unfair to their characters, and the realities each dealt with.  <br /> <br />Then we had those few nasty reviews that labeled the movie, \\"decadent, liberal scum,\\" \\"liberal social propaganda,\\" and \\"liberal fluff.\\"  In making the charge that this movie had an agenda (and by using the language they used), the reviewers only showed that they themselves have an agenda.  And it's not a very nice one.  Basically, any portrayal of gay people as happy, or loving, or human, or broken, or anything other than sick, is considered propaganda to these folks.  Well my friends, we do have happiness in our lives, and we do love, and we are often broken (just as you are), and sometimes more broken because of your cruelty.  Portraying our lives accurately and fairly is not some `liberal fluff.'  I feel really bad for those of you who cannot stand to see any honest portrayal of gay characters.  You're really going to have a hard time of it during the coming years when gay marriage, and ENDA, and other measures pass, assuring us the rights we are guaranteed by our constitution.  And they will pass.   <br /> <br />Next in the lexicon of irrational statements is that this movie is the product of a liberal Hollywood obsessed with politics.  Actually, the story was authored by a native writer in Wyoming who is not part of Hollywood.  One reviewer claimed that \\"Once again, Hollywood is beating down our morals.\\"  No, the movie is challenging you to see more than the black and white of this situation, but it apparently was not possible in your case.   <br /> <br />Then we have what at first seems to be a fair and accurate criticism... that they cheated on their wives, and destroyed their families.  A really good review was posted on February 9th by \\"Billy Bob.\\"  The wives were the victims of homophobia, just as the husbands were.   All you straight guys, close your eyes and imagine that you live on a planet where the majority was homosexual.  Anyone with attractions to women were considered inferior and a spiritual abomination.  Realize that if you are found out, it could cost you your life, or at least a lot of harassment.  So you marry a man because it is expected of you.  Are you going to tell me that if you met a woman who came onto you in the mountains that your nature wouldn't express itself?  That you wouldn't get away as often as possible to be with her?  If you think you wouldn't, you're not being honest - or fair. Your husband would be a victim then, just as Alma and Lureen were victims.  And you would be a victim of that prejudice too, just as Jack and Ennis were in this movie.  <br /> <br />Neither man shirked his responsibilities to his children, as some have claimed.  As poor as Ennis was, he refused to get together with Jack that last August because he had to work to pay his child support.  Those who said they abandoned their children need to watch the movie again.   <br /> <br />One person wondered if it had been a man and a woman, if \\"all this deception and cheating would be as overlooked as it is here?\\"  Please watch \\"Bridges of Madison County,\\" with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood.  Or, just about any movie with romance as the theme.  Deception and cheating are what sells movies..   <br /> <br />The same person who declared Hollywood is beating down our morals (wait!  didn't Hollywood make `The Passion of the Christ?), also said, \\"Come on!  Gay cowboys?\\"  LOL.   Ah yeah...  We are fully represented in all lifestyles available..  there are also gay doctors, gay lawyers, gay teachers, gay politicians, and on and on and on.....  And God help us all, there are even gay conservatives.   <br /> <br />\\"It's a movie about cheating on your spouse, regardless of the time period it's placed in.\\" <br />No, it's a movie about two men who fell in love unexpectedly, and neverwould have had spouses if they had the freedom to be what they were.   <br /> <br />One misguided individual even tells those of us who liked the film to `wake up.'  Apparently we aren't aware the silly critics are `blowing smoke up this film's ass.'  Then he tells us to `think for ourselves.'  Gee, I thought I was.  I'll bet most everyone who posted one way or the other thought for themselves, except maybe those with an agenda (who maybe had their opinions tainted by the Jerry Farwell's and Pat Robertson`s of the world).   Do you really think that your views are so right that you have to tell everyone else to wake up and agree with you?    <br /> <br />\\"All I could think of the whole time was how terrible they were. People think they were being `brave`, but in reality it doesn't matter that they were gay and in love - because they were destroying other people's lives and it's not fair or noble in any way.\\"  Could they have been faithful and noble if they had been allowed to be together?  Could they have experienced their nature in a noble way if society treated homosexuals in a noble way?   <br /> <br />Someone claimed John Wayne must be rolling over in his grave.  I doubt John Wayne would be too shocked by it.  He undoubtedly knew gay men, and probably gay cowboys.  But if he were so shocked about it that he'd roll over in his grave, then let him roll.  Those of us who are gay are under no obligation to hide in a closet so that he or anyone else can be at ease in their prejudice.   <br /> <br />Okay.....I've responded to all the remarks that I felt needed responding to.   <br /> <br />As for the Oscars?  I doubt Brokeback will win best film.  It surely should.  But my feeling is the politics ABOUT the movie will prevent it.  I hope I'm wrong.

B00092ZL80|5.0|This was about as great a concert (video or live) that I've ever seen.  The fun that each group looked like they were having  playing onstage with the other was impossible to contain....they look like they've been close friends for years.  I'm a huge fan of Chicago, but as great as they were in their solo set; EW+F's energy was over the top.  The beginning set with both bands got the show rolling fast, and the end with both bands back onstage will go down as towering a performance as has ever been played.  The 2 crossover songs: Bill Champlin singing \\"After the Love has Gone\\", and  Philip Bailey's turn at \\"If You Leave Me Now\\" were very nice touches.  The only complaint I had was how it was shot...the cuts came in too fast for my taste and were a bit distracting  .  But in the great scheme of the concert, it's a pretty minor quibble.  If you're tired of some acts who phone it in during live performances; or you just want to appreciate 2 very talented groups who deliver \\"money's worth and above\\"....get this disc set.  But be warned...you might wear yourself out dancing, toe-tapping, or just plain grooving to the thing.
074322454X|3.0|I bought this book because I am a diehard fan of the Band of Brothers HBO 10-episode series. I typically find that books on which movies are based grip me more than the derivative movie itself. Not in this case. I was hoping to find the story and especially the individual characters that were presented in the BoB movie (i.e., Winters, Nixon, Guarnere, etc.) fleshed out in the book. Instead, I found the writing stilted, the information mostly unsurprising, and the analysis of the psychological dimension of soldiering shallow and hackneyed. However, Ambrose's analysis of Easy Company's military tactics was excellent, as was his portrayal of the soldiers varied, but generally respectful, perceptions of their German enemy (e.g., Winters' admiration for the German soldier's proud bearing in their marches conducted while POWs). I was disappointed by how little information there was on Easy Company's enouncounter with the German concentration camp, which struck me as the most powerful episode (#9) of the BoB movie series. <br /> <br />The narrative would have benefited with more background WW2 information to understand exactly how important Easy Company's role was in the broader context of all that was occurring in the European theater. While Ambrose's writing is self-confessedly \\"inspirational\\" in purpose, it is sometimes difficult to separate how much of his praise for the valor of Easy Company's exploits reflects his own admiration for the heroism of the unit and how much is an accurate reflection of the importance of Easy Company's contribution to the Allied victory. Furthermore, since Ambrose acknowledges in the afterword that Easy Company exhibited an unusual bond that endured for the rest of some of the men's lives, the exceptional nature of Easy Company can be lost in the narrative with the consequence that readers may assume that this degree of solidarity within a Company was the norm in the American WW2 military, which, Ambrose acknowledges, is not the case.  <br/> <br />Despite these weaknesses, I found the book very easy to stay interested in simply because Easy Company's story is both remarkable and inspiring. This company managed to be at critical points in WW2 and demonstrated truly heroic soldiering. I have read Ambrose's first volume of his Nixon biography and found myself wondering why he couldn't have written Band of Brothers with the same eloquence and insightful analysis that he employed in the Nixon bio. Nevertheless, Ambrose's shortcomings do not entirely offset the powerful story of Easy Company. Worth reading so long as you don't approach it with inflated expectations from the movie.
1400032717|5.0|This book is purportedly a memoir by a 15-year-old British autistic kid who solves the mystery of who killed his neighbor's dog.

This is a remarkable book about how an autistic person thinks and sees the world.

B00005JMYI|5.0|Anchorman, the story of a man named Ron Burgundy, is a hilarious movie with a number of above average actors. <br /> <br />The movie starts off introducing you to the team.  <br />Ron Burgundy, played by Will Ferrel, is a somewhat naive person with a decent personality. He loves a nice glass of scotch, cigarettes, poetry and most of all, his dog Baxter, a wise dog who can speak english and spanish, and is described as \\"a miniature buddha, filled with hair\\". Ron also is an expert flute player. <br />Brian Fantana, played by Paul Rudd, is a vain, sexist who has a way with woman. <br />Champ Kind, played by David Koechner, is a very stereotypical Texan who likes to have fun, and is known for his, somewhat annoying catchphrase, \\"Whammy!\\". <br />Brick Tamland, played by the hilarious Steve Carrell,is a very stupid person with a mental problem, and says random things, in some moments, and screams alot. <br />Wes Mantooth, played by Vince Vaughn, is the leader of another newscast who placed #2 in the ratings, and has an extreme hatred, but respect for Ron Burgundy. <br />And Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate, is a woman that makes the newscast go crazy for her, and each try poor pickup attempts on her, however Ron is the only one who succeeds.  <br />She is intelligent, and a very good journalist. <br />Ron and Veronica have a great relationship, but it goes awry when Veronica finds out what he thinks about female anchors. <br />The story does a fantastic job of keeping you interseted, and has a huge number of big celebrity cameos. They include Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Fred Armisen, Jerry Minor, Seth Rogen, and Tim Robbins. <br />The good thing about this movie is that most comedies die down in \\"funnyness\\" at the end, but Anchorman keeps it the entire movie. <br />If your wondering about if it's okay to by the unrated version,  the difference is about 7 or 8 minutes of extra scenes, one where they say the F-word about 6 times. If this doesn't sound good to you, then try the theatre version. However it was a very funny movie that I will watch again and again. <br />
B00003CX95|5.0|I want to preface this review by stating my educational background is in European history so this is a subject on which I have some understanding. Also, I'm a big fan of movies and I generally enjoy historical films. I also understand that many of the negative reviews of this film, though not all, stem from the historical inaccuracies of the movie. Yes, this film is not historically accurate and as an historian I do not have a problem with that. I reconcile this apparent contradiction by viewing the movie Braveheart as historical fiction and nothing more. There seems to be a double standard in regards to historical fiction. There are many historical novels out on the market that are not always historically accurate, and yet, I do not hear much, if any, backlash about that. So Hollywood's dramatization of historical events carries the majority of the criticism. One of the things I like about historical movies is their ability to bring to life long forgotten time periods. I often tell people to enjoy the movies, don't gather your historical information form them, and let the movies encourage your own efforts to learn about the true historical events.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I feel Braveheart is a wonderful example of old fashioned epic storytelling. You have an underdog hero who overcomes immense hardship and adversity to make a huge impact on his world. Although the main character himself does not succeed in a literal sense of the word, he becomes a larger than life legend and a symbol for freedom and independence. This movie has much to entertain. It is loaded with romance, intrigue, betrayal, rivalries, drama, beautiful scenery, and epic and garish battle scenes. Although all of the actors were excellent, I want to specially mention Patrick McGoohan, who did a superb job depicting the ruthless King Edward I of England. He almost steals the whole movie. I really enjoyed David O'Hara as Stephen, the Irish Fighter, he provided some great lines of comic relief. This movie is an almost return to the epic movies of the 50s with updated special effects and it is very entertaining. So forget the historical inaccuracies and just enjoy the movie at face value: a great action and adventure movie.lief.

Moreover, arranged mariage and other life's goals were set out and was decided for a person.  <br /> <br />Ok Shakespare had a writers block, but the story is not there, nor is it the play Romeo and Juliet, that was not the theme of the story, it was just merely a part of the story. The real part of the story, as the title suggests, Shakespeare is in love. His love takes him to a place in his life that he has not experienced, well for a long time at least, she becomes why he wants to write and the very reason for his survival, and isnt' that what we want in life. Someone to love and someone to care about, whether it was 400 years ago or now??
B000005RFH|5.0|The CD (whatever version you may have) does not match up to the original Warner vinyl release I bought at the age of ten (and hid from my mom). I found a mint copy (vinyl) on the internet and if you play it on high quality equipment with a kick A$$ turntable you will only then realize what this album truly means to the metal Genre. Believe me, this album rocks! They recorded it in an afternoon! There's no stops between tracks, they just kept on rocking. This is by far the best album Black Sabbath ever came out with, by far. You must listen to the vinyl version to understand what I'm trying to convey. Every track is very important to the album. This is a must have classic for vinyl rock collectors. For those of you who don't know about vinyl - shame on you! <br /> <br />G Force
B000005RU2|5.0|This was already a great record. The remastering is very good, with an enhanced clarity but a very familiar mix. The additional track are also nice. This album helped to cement Deep Purple's reputation along with Machine Head. Just go ahead and get it, Deep Purple are a really great live band from an era of great live bands. Only the Allman Brothers or the Who can compete with the energy of this record.
B00005JO04|1.0|Its a copy of the traffic but its no where in that class. What you get is a series of short rather senseless stories that merge into a rather silly finish.  <br /> <br />I was happy when it was over and I could leave
B00005JOFO|5.0|A very moving and touching story.  If a person has any humanity at all, he or she will be touched to the heart. <br /> <br />I hope it will be released to DVD soon.   <br /> <br />Maybe it will help to eradicate the intolerance and hatred that some people feel for gay people.
B000002549|5.0|This CD shows why Streisand is who she is; the ultimate DIVA! This lady can sing anything and on this wonderful collection she proves it. Barbra recored the album way back in 1973, and because the record label was afraid of low sales due to the classical nature of the material, didn't release it until 1976. What a treat for fans of Barbra and fans of classical music. Barbra showcases hew vocal strengths in the 10 tracks singing in different languages. I first heard this CD at a dinner party 15 years ago and pretty much forgot about it until I saw a few for sale on Ebay. I remembered loving it and immediately bought it through Amazon. I highly recommend this CD for all those people who simply love music. It will put you in a very relaxed mood, almost as if your home is filled with candles. Since I bought it I've listened to it at least 20 times or more and will continue playing it in my home. Don't worry if you can't understand what Barbra is saying if you don't comprehend the laguage of the song; you'll know it's still Barbra doing what she does the best. A few final notes ; Barbra Streisand was nominated for a Grammy for the album. And Streisand has personally stated that this was the hardest album vocally she has ever worked on in her career. In short a beautiful CD for any home.
B00000JGHM|5.0|FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF HEAT; --- De Niro gives a very controlled performance, giving the impression of a powerful man who lives by his judgment, discipline, and instincts. Pacino gives a wild performance, depicting a troubled man that knows he is sacrificing too much for his work. De Niro's love interest is touching, fragile and sensitive, whereas Pacino's is an innappropriate mess, and is at the heart of his character's ongoing agitated state. Both De Niro and Pacino, though portrayed as almost opposites in this film, are very effective and endearing characters throughout \\"Heat\\".<br /><br />THE THEME OF HEAT:  --- Robert De Niro plays Neil McCauley, a prosperous career criminal who is contemplating getting out of the business and out of the country after one last heist. All the while, Vincent Hanna, a very dedicated and obsessive detective lieutenant played by Al Pacino, feverishly tries to catch him in the act.<br /><br />IMPRESSIONS OF \\"HEAT\\" --- As long as the scenes are full of action, the film is strictly 5-star entertainment; but when the action slows, there are some potholes. Fortunately there is a lot of action and it is magnificently done, although it is a bit larger than life.<br /><br />PACINO & DE NIRO - TRUE STARS THAT SHARE THE SCREEN & SEVERAL SCENES<br /><br />Pacino and De Niro actually have coffee together in a scene preceding the climax and it is a nice treat for movie fans as their contrasting styles make one wish for many refills at that L.A. coffee shop. On the minus side, Pacino is a little too boisterous to be credible in a very self-aware way. His portrayal in \\"Heat\\" reminds me of his role in \\"Dick Tracy\\", in 1990, as \\"Big Boy Caprice\\" which was a role that garnered him an Academy Award nomination for \\"Best Supporting Actor.\\" Unfortunately, it was a little too over-the-top for a serious film like \\"Heat\\". Nonetheless, such an over-the-top performance won him the Academy Award for \\"Best Actor\\" in \\"Scent of A Woman\\" in 1992.<br /><br />De Niro,in amazing contrast to Pacino, brought a remarkably restrained, though very visceral and sympathetic anti-hero to life in the form of a hardened criminal. He said, \\"Don't have any attachments that you can't drop in 30 seconds if the heat is around the corner,\\" frequently, but it is unsure whether he was trying to convince himself or the others of his stated intentions.<br /><br />THE CAST: PLUS Michael Mann as Director - Producer & Screenwriter<br /><br />Al Pacino - Vincent Hanna [Lives for his job - his job is death!]<br /><br />Robert De Niro - Neil McCauley [Why is this man a criminal?]<br /><br />Val Kilmer - Chris Shiherlis [McCauley's left-hand man -- Has gambling, marital and emotional problems]<br /><br />Jon Voight - Nate [McCauley's fence/friend/confidante -- Don't we all need one?]<br /><br />Tom Sizemore - Michael Cheritto [Tells McCauley he's in it for the action]<br /><br />Diane Venora - Justine [Vincent Hanna's wife -- terrible performance -- During her dramatic climax she whines to Hanna, \\"I'm high on grass and Prozac!\\"]<br /><br />Amy Brenneman - Eady [Nice love interest for McCauley, maybe he should retire and go to Bora Bora with her]<br /><br />Ashley Judd - Charlene [Val Kilmer's wife in movie - will she turn him in to keep her son?]<br /><br />Mykelti Williamson - Det. Drucker<br /><br />Ted Levine - Bosko<br /><br />Wes Studi - Det. Casals<br /><br />Danny Trejo - Trejo<br /><br />Tom Noonan - Kelso<br /><br />Dennis Haysbert - Breedan<br /><br />William Fichtner - Van Zant [Waingro is not the only jerk]<br /><br />Hank Azaria - Alan Marciano [Ashley Judd is cheating on hubby!]<br /><br />Kevin Gage - Waingro [a real jerk]<br /><br />Natalie Portman - Lauren [Vincent Hanna's step-daughter]<br /><br />FINAL IMPRESSIONS: -- This is a powerful drama that despite some flaws in characterizations is very compelling to watch. It is also hard to decide who to root for; McCauley or Hanna?<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT THE DVD --  The version I have is the 1-disk release. It is an excellent widescreen transfer, but there are none of the nice features of the 2-disk set to enjoy.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This turned out to be a very good movie about Johnny Cash.The <br />movie takes you to his early days growing up in Arkansas.You <br />are also shown the harsh treatment that Cash recieved from his father.Cash's brother was killed which further divided father <br />and son.Cash also played alongside some of the legends of the <br />musical world like Carl Perkins,Elvis Pressley,and Waylon Jennings.Cash's addiction to drugs is well displayed in this movie.His career took a beating,his marriage failed,and he hit <br />rock bottom during this period of his life.The heroic efforts of <br />June Carter and her family helped him defeat this addiction and <br />get back on his feet.After that the career of Johnny Cash skyrocketed.He did his famous \\"Folsom Prison\\" recordings that <br />dominated the music scene in the world.He was able to have his own television show.He became one of the most beloved figures in the world.He also married June Carter.He has since passed away but he left a giant impact.Long Live Johnny and June.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The strongest parts of this film is the real-life adaptation of the Bennet family.  We see Mrs. Bennet not as the dim-witted mother who is eager to marry her daughter's off but as a real mother concerned over real-life situations in those days.  Yes, back then a woman's ticket to a good life was to marry well but it was even harder to marry for both money and love. <br /> <br />But that's not where the movie ends.  We are exposed to breathtaking cinematorgraphy, (Some parts of Britain I never knew exist!) and actors who are molded so well for their parts.  Kiera Knightly shines as Elizabeth Bennet in this adaptation and Jenna Malone and Carey Mulligan are not as annoying as Lydia and Kitty in the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br />One set back to this movie would be its adaptation.  For those who are exposed to the Pride and Prejudice for the first time may be left confused.  The story moves forward in some parts through narration or dialogue rather than seeing actual scenes , such as Wickham's dealings and his connection to Mr. Dary's sister.  Also, the audience has to pay attention to the background and foreground parts of the film as the story moves forward through background interactions.  This movie is so much more 'open' then previous films that (blending background with foreground)the viewer will need to pay more attention to the dialogue and try and understand the feelings of the characters (ex: Eliza's alienation during the Netherfield ball). <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: <br /> <br />This is a great film with real-life in 19th century appeal.  Mr. Darcy is more of a character to understand in this film and Ms. Bennet shines true.  I think we get more of a sense of Ms. Austen's (author) feminist views (abliet they aren't harsh ones).  Bits of the movie may need more concentration as there is blending of background/foreground.  Also, Austen truists may feel a bit cheated with only an adaptation version of the film.  For those who wanta more 'true' and stretched out version of Pride and Prejudice, I recommend the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.   <br />
067101756X|3.0|While the book doesn't prove or disprove the existence of extraterestrials, what Phillip Corso has done here is add another chapter to the UFO hysteria that commenced in earnest immediately after WWII. The whole idea that flying saucers are of alien origin is disinformation put out by the government but nicely developed by hollywood, to conceal the very earthly origins of this technology in Nazi secret weapons development. There is a world of exotic technology developed right here on earth that certain powerful special interests feel compelled to conceal from the general public. The world in which we live is largely fraudulent, the truth is carefully guarded and hoaxes are the name of the game in the management of the masses. Keeping us stupid is the preferred method of managing our perceptions. Corso does his part for the cause, a government man to the end. <br /> <br />Where Corso really delivers, is with his insight on the \\"shadow US government\\" and the inner world of U.S. intelligence activities. He reveals how the CIA was considered virtually in league with the KGB against the U.S.! He also sheds light on how the legitimate U.S. government was usurped by a \\"shadow\\" committee of industrial, military, and financial interests. This in my opinion is the most valuable info in this book. Corso was an army intelligence operative, and therefore part and parcel of the government's UFO psyop to conceal testing of secret Nazi technologies and their further covert development by the US government in the post WWII period. This is not to say that aliens don't exist, but that this book doesn't really address this issue. It merely supports established government disinfo initiatives such as the Roswell incident and all that grew out of it. It can safely be said in light of known facts that the flying saucers that started all of this hoopla in the first place were made right here on earth. On the other hand, for anyone wishing to get a unique glimpse of how the U.S. Constitutional government was secretly subverted in the post WWII era, Phillip Corso pretty much spills the beans.
B000E33VWW|3.0|Capote is an extraordinary film. I considered giving it four stars seeing the average amazon rating but no, in order for me to right a faithful description of this movie, I must mention..<br /><br />Capote contains some beautiful sets. It's not an expensive film, I liked how the character Capote is introduced, also liked how he speaks and his character definition and how precisely the director has depicted his state of mind. In the end, I thought the film seemed a tad too realistic and thus, looked dull. However, it is what is meant to be, a documentary'ish depiction of a columnist/author who decided to write a book on two killers. Later,he is stuck between going ahead and printing his book (In Cold Blood) or fighting for the cause of the two convicts. He could have gone either way.<br /><br />Capote's character isnt overtly amusing, isnt too funny, it's his human side that will make you chuckle/semi grin now and then. I thought the depiction of 1959 to mid 1960's was simply superb considering it's a low budget venture.<br /><br />SEMI SPOILER ALTERT/WHAT I LIKED -<br />I liked the scene in the film where Capote refuses to take Lee's phone call. I liked how he acknowledges a man's remark on the introductory speech of his book and later addresses him as his father.<br /><br />Overall, I felt Capote's character is a tad boring. I understand it's a real story and all, but in the end it seems a bit too realistic for a movie to stand.<br /><br />The film lacked irony, magical moments, whoa inducing twists or sequences, a consistent piano sound in the theme and a character that would be very likeable.<br /><br />Chris Cooper's role is rather yawn inducing. However, I MUST SAY, Capote is one of the most daring thin edged directed movies I have ever seen. There is very very little room for error and since I am a big time movie enthusiast(movie person too) I felt it somewhat wins it's battle.<br /><br />However, I got the message of the film, the facts of it, however, Where do I go from there?<br /><br />Possibly one of the best 3star films you'll ever see. Definitely worth watching for those who know what it's about.lms you'll ever see. Definitely worth watching for those who know what it's about.
B00005JKG5|5.0|This movie has been an all time favorite of mine for years and will be for years to come. Yes, it is about a dancer with a dream, but it is also much more than that. It does a fabulous job of showing viewers what it is like to live life from the heart. From a heart of passion, dreams, and desires and to never settle for less than we want. It is about acceptance of others for who they are and where they are at. It is about living life to the fullest. Yes, you can have it all!
B00000J7JO|4.0|Around The World is definitely not the ideal opener for any album. It tries to be another \\"Give It Away\\" but fails miserably and need I mention, rather annoying vocals from Anthony.<br /><br />\\"Scar Tissue\\" is okay and at times really good , \\"Otherside\\" is one of the stronger songs on this album. Otherside has good lyrics and a great video to it's credit. Surprisingly, it was also what really got me into RHCP. The album contains excellent and consistent bass which will never bore you during those lonesome drives. \\"Get On Top\\" calls for the listener to press the skip button. \\"Californication\\" is a treat for all music listeners. It's everything that is right with rock and roll today. In a way it will also be one of the two songs this band will be remembered for (Other being \\"under the bridge\\")<br /><br />\\"Easily\\" has it's moments and is ideal for a catchy moment while \\"porcelain\\" feeds the music hungry listener with a rather refreshing wave of relaxed goozy sound. \\"I like Dirt\\" is the fun song of the album (Remember PEA anyone?)<br /><br />The Other two stand out tracks on this album is the sombre, \\"Road Trippin\\" and the overtly melodic, \\"Purple Strain\\".<br /><br />Something I noticed about Californication is that even though all the singles are really well produced, some of the other tracks have the stereo kind of sound which makes them easy to be forgotten in one's memory. The truest of true RHCP fans will not really love this album. I recommend it to all,semi interested by the way.<br /><br />Overall Rating - 7.9/10
006056251X|5.0|I'm a big fan of Lisa Kleypas and this is by far her best yet! From the moment I opened the book to the time I read the last word it was nearly impossible to put this book down. The characters are so fun and exciting that I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what would transpire next! Lisa gets better with each book that I only wish she could write 3 or 4 at once so I wouldn't have to wait so long between them! Two thumbs up and 5 BIG STARS for Devil in Winter!!!
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is true, classic, Disney magic. It has everything I've always wanted from my animated movies: gorgeous visuals, laugh-aloud humour, sing-along songs, an appealing hero, and a heroine little girls can feel good about looking up to. I was glad to see this movie get Disney's Platinum treatment -- it's my favourite Disney film, and getting to watch this new, restored DVD took me right back to being six years old and seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />There's real magic in this movie, something that I feel Disney's lost in the last few years. Aladdin is a great hero, relying on his brains and wit rather than brute strength and a sword, and his opposite number is absolutely insidious, a true love-to-hate villain. Robin Williams as the Genie is outstanding, and I know I've come to appreciate his humour a lot more as I've gotten old enough to understand all the references he makes in his wonderful ad-libbed tangents. Alan Mencken's score is just fabulous -- sweeping and epic, with songs that are both touching and humours by turns. \\"One Jump Ahead\\", \\"Friend Like Me\\", and \\"Prince Ali\\" delight and amuse, while the \\"One Jump Ahead\\" reprise offers pathos to Aladdin's character. And of course, the show-stopping \\"A Whole New World\\" still makes my heart soar and my inner romantic swoon gloriously. It's far and away my favourite Disney love song.<br /><br />My favourite thing about this movie, though, is and has always been Jasmine. She was the first heroine I really admired, because she was the first to take her destiny into her own hands and really go for what she wanted. She's strong, intelligent, and independant -- and she had a temper, and yelled, which always made me like her a lot more than those sweet, softspoken, entirely too passive heroines of earlier years. Her yearning for freedom, her desire to be her own person -- those are things I've come to appreciate a lot more as I've gotten older. She's so appealing, and a great role model for little girls -- certainly moreso than other heroines who would try to teach our daughters that they should be quiet and gentle and let the men do all the adventuring!<br /><br />This is my favourite Disney movie, and it's still highly entertaining, even after so many years. I recommend this to any Disney fan, anyone with children, and anyone with a kid still lurking somewhere inside herself. It's a true delight!ertainly moreso than other heroines who would try to teach our daughters that they should be quiet and gentle and let the men do all the adventuring! <br /> <br />This is my favourite Disney movie, and it's still highly entertaining, even after so many years. I recommend this to any Disney fan, anyone with children, and anyone with a kid still lurking somewhere inside herself. It's a true delight!
B000E8QVWY|4.0|No doubt, that the acting performances by Phoenix and Reese are top-notch and really fabulous and for that aspect this movie is worth 5 stars. The life of Johnny Cash up to a certain time in the late 60s or so is well portrayed, although it's kind of depressing with Johnny's drug use, alcohol, infidelity and so forth. Overall it's an inspiring film, especially for aspiring singer/songwriters, because this film gives them hope that their music may reach a broader audience some day too. And the inspiration aspect alone is well worth watching this flick. The music is great too and as mentioned Phoenix just plays his part so very well and Reese as June Carter does also an excellent job without overplaying the role. <br />The photography has also been executed very well especially regarding the set details for each particular era. It's just that there are a number of slow passages and as every movie should have a beginning, a middle and an end, the ending was rather abrupt and out of the blue so to speak without a lead-in and that bothered me a bit. But overall it's an inspiring movie and well worth watching it.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I had been waiting for years for this to come out on DVD -- having only ever owned it on Beta-tape before! (What an unfortunate decision on my parents' behalf -- I can't be blamed, as I was three at the time!) But it was well worth the wait -- Lady and the Tramp is even better than I'd remembered from my childhood. It's one of the best, though I feel one of the most unfairly overlooked, Disney movies, one of the old classics that so deserved to be restored. Who could fail to be touched by this lovely story of a darling miss and a scoundrel from the wrong side of the tracks? Lady is lovely and charming, and the Tramp is absolutely enchanting. Even the side characters seem improved with age -- after all, what toddler finds the jokes based on the Russian wolfhound Boris all that funny? This story still brings warmth to my heart, making me squeal like the very small girl I still am inside. And the music! Of course everyone loves \\"He's a Tramp\\", and \\"Bella Notte\\" still makes any romantic's heart swoon, but I confess, the song I'd never realised I'd loved was Darling's \\"La La Lu\\" -- it's so very sweet, a tender lullaby with real feeling behind it.<br /><br />Disney did a fantastic job giving this one the Platinum treatment. The visuals are more stunning than ever before, with enhanced colour and a sharper image, yet retaining the true charm and style of the older Disney movies. It isn't made to look \\"super-new\\" -- just shined up enough to bring out the beautiful, antique-y style. The DVD extras are also all amusing -- something that has often been lacking on Disney DVDs. It was really very neat to get a behind-the-scenes look at one of the older classics.<br /><br />I would strongly, strongly recommend this DVD to any Disney fan -- it's well worth the purchase!
B000003TA9|5.0|\\"Dirty\\" was Sonic Youth's most commercial album. I am not sure if this was done on purpose, but it makes 'Dirty' SY's most open album. Open for the lovers of alternative/progressive rock with an almost jazzlike way of listening to music.  <br /> <br />Musically it may not be as interesting as their 'Daydream Nation' or masterpiece 'Sister' but there are great songs on here. Without a doubt this is their best collection of songs. <br /> <br />'100%' was an MTV hit and could rival with 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', the track following that 'Swimsuit Issue' (Gordon) with strained and coarse vocals has a great break and suddenly slows down.  <br /> <br />A dreamer side of SY can mostly be found in the songs sung by Kim Gordon like 'PR' or the thumping, metallike 'Drunken Butterfly'. 'Shoot' is carried by Kim's voice and a rolling bassline. <br /> <br />Best song on the album is the brilliant 'Sugar Kane' with some great moments of pure musical genious, clarity, chord changes. I could go and on. Similar songs like 'Chapel Hill' and 'Purr' come close too. <br /> <br />Even know almost 15 years later there is so much you can still discover in the album, it surely shows that Sonic Youth are the godfathers of all the indie/underground bands that followed. Husker Du and Dinosaur came close, but in importance to alternative music only the Beatles, Neil Young and the Velvet Underground are above Sonic Youth.  <br /> <br />Their approach to music is almost jazzlike, and like many jazzartists, after a while they started making fully rounded songs but of a scary quality. <br /> <br />If you are interested in buying a Sonic Youth album but never heard anything before get this one.
B00005K9QP|4.0|As every rock fan worth his or her salt knows, Eric Clapton was in his prime during the 1960's. Be it with the Yardbirds, Bluesbreakers, Cream or Blind Faith, it seemed like El Clapitan couldn't fail. And in this case, working with Mayall for an all-too-short one album colaboration, he didn't. And though there are some lesser throwaways (those instrumentals near the end, with the exception of Steppin' Out, qualify there), this disc is packed with brilliant material. Be it All Your Love, Hideaway, Double Crossing Time, What I Say, Parchman Farm, Ramblin' on My Mind or Steppin' Out, Bluesbreakers with Clapton never fails to deliver. And though it isn't the most creative album ever made, if you're into the blues (and what Clapton fan isn't?), you should take a look at this.
0790731002|2.0|Oh god, what wasn't wrong with this movie. 1st of all what's with the nipples on the batsuits, was that really necessary? 2nd of all the actors were all wrong. I mean I love Jim Carey, but I don't think he was quite right for that particular role. Honestly, if you're a harecore batman fan this movie is definitly not for you. Of course if you were a hardcore batman fan you probably have all ready seen this movie. Personally I loved it, probably not for the best reasons but at least I can give it some credit. So if you need a pick me up watch this movie, it lets you know that somebody's more of an idiot than you are.
6305678715|5.0|This is a fabulous movie.  I have it on video and decided to replace the video with DVD.  Sean Connery, Meg Ryan, and Mark Harmon are amoung my favorite actors and actresses, so to get a great movie with all three of them in it, is a real bonus. <br />Dee Moffat <br />Port Angeles, WA
1591391105|2.0|This is an attempt to teach leadership.  I don't believe that this skill can be taught.  I agree with the book's idea that you need to establish credibility up front, by going after low hanging fruit, but I don't think that leadership can be taught.  A leader is formed from their background in which character is built.  I feel the time and effort that I put into this book would have been better spent on some other endeavor.
1577311760|5.0|Nothing has made this much sense to me since I began meditating 30 years ago.  Thank you Mr Tolle.  If you have a spiritual practice these exercises will build your spirit muscle.  These insights will explain some of the crazyness we see everyday. I especially like the \\"pain body\\" theory.  It explains a lot about my friends and relatives and their problems.  I'm listening for my 4th time and it makes more sense as I actually practice the exercises. I'm treating it as a college course.  I have studied it every day for the last 3 weeks.  It's a real how to manual.  A great source of Joy and Peace for me since I began practicing conscious occupation of my body.  I really enjoy me now. Treat yourself...  or not...  Love.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Today I downloaded a song from LimeWire by Eminem called \\"The Kids\\" and it said that it it was track 19 on MMLP.I always thought that this album only had 18 tracks... <br /> <br />Anyways it's a really funny song in which Em has to be substitute teacher for a classroom full of kids.Throughout the song,he tells the kids stories about drug junkies.If \\"The Kids\\" really isn't on this CD then try to dig it up somewhere in the net.I say it's one of his best songs.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't remember ever seeing anything about Firefly when it was on tv, but after seeing the trailers for the movie, I got the series through Netflix, and I thought it was incredible. So much so that I bought it. It could have gone so many places; it's really too bad it was cancelled. For any Buffy/Angel or Whedon fan, or anyone who likes Sci-fi or a good adventure, this is a sure-fire hit.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|For a group trying to follow up on a masterpiece such as Songs For The Deaf,Queens Of The Stone Age did a admirable job.This was still one of the best,if not the best rock albums I heard in 2005,along The White Stripes Get Behind Me Satan.The Cd starts out very strong with Medication,Everybody Knows You're Insane,Tangled Up In Plaid,Burn The Witch,In My Head,and Little Sister all being very strong tracks.From there things turn a bit strange,but really no stranger than Queens have ever been,and still solid.Bottom line is this cd doesnt really depart too much from what QOTSA have done in the past and is easily the second best cd from them.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I bought this DVD for my mother, but I loved this movie much as she did, and it still remains the best classical movie that we have ever seen.  This is the reason we bought the disc.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens' album \\"Illinois\\" is huge.  A huge artistic achievement which is hugely long and hugely ambitions - and just one part of an equally huge and ambitious project.  Mr. Stevens intends to create an album for each and every one of all fifty states.  Given that this album took two years to make, I'm guessing he'll either give up halfway through or be old as Methuselah by the time he's done.  And strangely enough, I hope it's the latter.    The reasoning behind that last statement has to do with how simply incredible \\"Illinois\\" is.  First of all, unless you're one of the lucky few who listened to the first album in the series, \\"Michigan\\", \\"Illinois\\" will sound like nothing you've ever heard before.  Think high school marching band and chorus + offbeat Sixties jazz/lounge + Phillip Glass synthesizers + banjo-powered folk music and you'll begin to get a grasp on where he's at... some of the time.  The truth is, Sufjan Stevens is able to spring from genre to genre quite easily (perhaps this has to do with the fact that he plays a VERY large variety of instruments), and he manages to excel at nearly all of them.  His compositions are rich with detail even at their simplest - say, the guitar, piano and vocal parts of \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\", which twist and swirl in interesting, unpredictable and unsettling ways.    The aforementioned song is also a good example of the other element that makes \\"Illinois\\" great, which is that Stevens is a lyricist of great intellect and conscience, who has an uncanny ability to arouse sympathy from his audience.  In \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" he manages to humanize one of the most notorious and atrocious serial killers of all time, while simultaneously giving us his life story, a picture of his victims, and realizing that he too has a darker side \\"underneath the floorboards\\".  And what's more, almost every song on the album has this kind of detail.    In short, \\"Illinois\\" is an album that manages to crystallize several different stories and reflections into a coherent whole which, amazingly, still sounds great.  The album is not without its shortcomings - being as long as it is, the last part of the album inevitably feels repititious and slightly lagging.  The gripes, however, are minor.  \\"Illinois\\" is an amazing feat of musicianship and lyricism, and is probably one of the best albums of last year.  Do yourself a favor, and listen to it.
0143034901|3.0|What a motley heap of emotions this novel puts you through! It is a splendid page turner, and the suspense is quite well-strung even though the reader gets to feel quite smart \\"figuring out\\" parallells and mysteries within the two stories. Even the ending is quite predictable once you have flown through half the book.<br /><br />The premise of the story is quite clever - The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is an intriguing concept. The narrator, Daniel, finds the book \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" in this \\"Harry Potter-like\\" place, and soon reality imitates fiction. In this regard I found the feel quite similar to fellow Spanish writer Arturo-Perez Reverte's \\"Club Dumas\\".<br /><br />The language ranges from vivid and lucid to downright bloated, vulgar and cliche-ridden. Zafon does not quite have the gift of subtlety and understatement; here everything is spelled out - no need for quiet contemplation or wonder. The touching passages are really touching, the jokes are really funny, and the macabre is really, really macabre... It is typical Gothic fare for at least one third of the story.<br /><br />All in all, the novel is a worthwhile read. I especially liked the mood of Barcelona as a setting - Zafon has managed to convey its sense of mystery, even though listing all the street names and tram lines gets a bit tedious.<br />The Shadow of the Wind is a good rather than a great novel. It could easily have been half as long, more subtle and less heavy-handed on the literary cliches; however, this is the author's first major work (at least of what has been translated), and I am sort of curious as to what he will publish next...
B0002OERI0|1.0|okay, so when my mom starts singing along to every song on this album u knoe that greenday has sold out.  they arent the same as they were in the 90's.  They plain suck now.  they used to appeal to hard rockers and punks, now they appeal to little 5 year old girls and 40 year old women.  they used to be one of my favorite bands.  everything before there greatist hits album is good.  dont bother with shenanigans and american idiot they both blow!
B000059QYB|5.0|This is an excellent collection of Billy Idol's best work. All tracks have been 24-Bit Digitally Remastered and as a result the sound quality is superb. This is a dancer's delight rock and roll gem. Featured here are \\"Dancing With Myself\\", \\"Mony Mony\\", \\"White Wedding\\", \\"Rebel Yell\\" (studeo and live cuts), \\"Eyes Without A Face\\" (my favorite), \\"Flesh For Fantasy\\", \\"To Be A Lover\\" and \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\". Idol was one of punk rocks best artists regardless of what some critics thought. This is a keeper for sure.
B000069AUI|5.0|All of the songs in this CD are awesome. Once again, Coldplay hits a  homerun with this one. I used to prefer classic rock music only, but this band has expanded my taste in music.
B00004U2G4|5.0|Jeff Beck's first album entitled \\"Truth\\" is a classic rock masterpiece showcasing the voice of Rod Stewart, the virtuosity of Beck's guitar playing with Ron Wood on bass and Mick Waller on drums. 'The Shape of Things' (a Yardbirds staple) opens this disc and the rest, they say, is history. One of the highlights of this fantastic cd is 'Beck's Bolero' which, btw, includes work from Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page. The whole disc is terrific and belongs along the side of works from Page, Clapton, Hendrix, Santana, etc. Essential classic rock to say the least.
B00005JOM9|3.0|Last year in the movie \\"Broken Flowers,\\" Bill Murray played an aging Lothario who discovers, long after the fact, that he had fathered a child. That revelation comes as something of a shock to him and launches him on a turbulent road trip in search of his offspring. <br /> <br />Bree Osbourne, the main character in \\"Transamerica,\\" would probably find Murray's dilemma pretty small potatoes.  <br /> <br />Played by Felicity Huffman, Bree's a Southern California waitress and telemarketer who learns that she, too, has a son she didn't know about.  <br /> <br />The short explanation behind that rather sizable lapse is that she's a pre-op transsexual -- formerly a glum-looking man named Stanley Schupach -- who's just one crucial procedure away from complete sexual reassignment. <br /> <br />More than most women, Bree understandably objects to being casually called \\"dude,\\" and motherhood definitely doesn't fit into her plans. Her doctor (Elizabeth Pena), however, refuses to greenlight her final surgery unless Bree owns up to Stanley's offspring, so she heads to New York to meet her son Toby (Kevin Zegers). As fate would have it, he's a 17-year-old runaway who deals drugs, hustles, shoplifts and has an eye toward a career in pornography.  <br /> <br />Obviously, we're a long way from the cinematic realm of, say, \\"Cheaper By the Dozen.\\" But the foregoing synopsis, while accurate, makes \\"Transamerica\\" sound a lot more sordid than it actually is. The movie's most interesting twist is that Bree, despite all the factors that make her different, is a lot more traditional and conservative than most of the characters she encounters. We see the story through her eyes and, as she and Toby travel back to Los Angeles, she encounters a lot of characters.  <br /> <br />Huffman has been nominated for an Oscar for her performance and deservedly so; she's the film's center. All through the movie, she manages to both hide behind herself (obscured behind heavy make-up, constantly apprehensiveabout her enunciation and intonation) and still remain sympathetic. Viewers who know Huffman only from \\"Desperate Housewives\\" may not recognize Lynette Scavo anywhere onscreen. <br /> <br />The movie is also populated with other fine performances, particularly Zegers, who looks like a young Billy Crudup and has some of the same range; Graham Greene, as a kindly cattle farmer; and Burt Young, Carrie Preston and Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's father, sister and practically radioactive mother. <br /> <br />The movie's main drawback, however, is its fairly languid pace and sense of familiarity. It never really breaks out of its groove or aspires to heights beyond those of a standard low-budget comedy. Despite this, or maybe because of it, viewers who aren't scared off by the subject may find \\"Transamerica\\" a brash-but-amusing little surprise.  <br />
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC did not die with Bon Scott. Quite the contrary. They probably made their finest album when they did \\"Back In Black\\". This is a classic rock and heavy metal masterpiece without exception. The remastering is excellent and is a must own for any collecter of these genres. Turn it up dudes!!
0307276902|5.0|The best book on addiction I have ever read - I don't care if he took drematic licence on the facts  - It gave me great understanding  of addiction plus hope for my loved ones.
B0000029AP|5.0|First released in 1975, this is Aerosmith's finest album although there are a lot of you that will not agree. It features the roots of the group which is a blues and hard rock blend. This was a period of hard playing and partying for the group and this rocker exhibits all of that and more becoming a classic rock 70s centerpiece for many. Play it often and play it loud. Remastered for better sound quality, it's well worth adding to your collection. Featuring the smash hits \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\".
0316172324|4.0|I enjoyed Gladwell's writing style and ability to incorporate data from many fields.  In the end, I find his analyses a bit shallow, but useful food for thought.
B000003CMD|4.0|Bass player Berry Oakley was killed in a motorcycle accident during the recording of this album. It wasn't the first death of an originating band member because Gregg Allman's brother Duane died in another bike accident prior to the release of the classic \\"Eat A Peach\\". \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" has, in spite of tragedy, also become one of the best in rock history. The Allman Brothers survived and released this gem when other bands may have packed it in (Zeppelin comes to mind with the death of Bonzo). Highlights on this disc include 'Wasted Words', 'Ramblin' Man', \\"Southbound' and 'Jessica'. The upbeat, country infused 'Pony Boy' ends the album in an upbeat way in spite of the tragedy.
1932100385|5.0|anyone who wishes to avoid or reverse disease should read this important book; especially cancer, heart disease, and obesity.  The author has impeccable credentials and has run innnumerable studies to form his opinions and results.
B000007ODL|4.0|This is must own album for lovers of blues/rock. JJ Cale's music reached other artists including Lynrd Skynrd (\\"Call Me The Breeze\\") and Eric Clapton (\\"Cocaine\\" and \\"After Midnight\\"). It is laid back and smooth as glass blues at it's best. Cale is a master craftsman though he may be too modest to admit it.
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|As I write, Janine is ravishing Vivaldi!!!! He's loving it.... The sounds herd here are those of Janine's voluptuous orgasm exploding from her Stradivarious.  <br /> <br />Emotions native tongue is music.  <br />NEVER BEFORE have I heard two musicians more passionately express their feelings.  <br /> <br />This love trandsends the centuries!
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Some of you are overly critical of John Mayer stepping away from his \\"normal\\" album style but obviously some of you don't appreciate his \\"bluesy\\" side. What in the world is wrong with artists changing and playing different styles? Nothing at all as long as they do it well which in this case John did. In fact it is great that Mayer did this album to push him away from the pop icon he had become. Good for him and good for those of us who appreciate a versatile artist. Great backup from Pino Palladino (bass) and Steve Jordan (drums). Great sounding power trio. BTW, Mayer and Co. give a nice rendition of Jimi Hendrix's tune \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\".
B00000099Y|5.0|Whenever looking upon Tool's catalogue, the same dilemma comes up on my mind: to choose which album I find better achieved between this one and Lateralus. From where I stand as a fan, both are fine pieces of music raised to some sort of perfection; but, until arriving at this level of feelings, things started on opposite points for each of them: if Lateralus had an immediate impact on me (I think because of my progressive roots, lets say it this way), Aenima needed much more time to digest and getting into; the outstanding opening track, \\"Stinkfist\\", was initially overshadowing everything else coming after - which, as a matter of fact, is precisely the main reason why I don't place Undertow at the same level of Aenima or Lateralus - the quality I find on the first 2 tracks is higher than on the rest of the album. But that's not the case here... out of the blue I started to contemplate the magnetism of the sound on the entire album, the epic \\"Pushit\\", or the power, speed and lyrics of the title-track, absolutely tremendous. With no doubt an album and band vital to know.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|What a releif to hear music that I can actually understand.Very nice, easy to listen to. I found the disc relaxing, like a hot shower or a good book. We may have lost Frank and Dean and others, but we still have some appreciation for that kind of music. Let's keep supporting this kind of music and maybe people will realize that Rap is not music, but just noise.
B00004X10B|5.0|The Tamarac Pro 12 is a well thought out and well made camera bag which holds more gear than my previous Lowepro Magnum AW for much less cost.  Amazon's price on this bag was lower than anywhere else I shopped.  Great Value and Great Price plus free shipping made this a fantastic purchase. <br /> <br />Grant
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I did not get into this movie at all.  I say read the book instead.  Some of the art was good and there was some eye contacts in the movie that made some scenes rather sexy, but other than that, the movie did not do much for me.  I had a hard time sitting through it.
B0000019HU|5.0|Slint are the forefathers of Math-Rock, or whatever you want to call the Shellac-Fugazi-Jesus Lizard-Clutch sound.  If you are a fan of these bands, get all three of Slint's releases.  Trust me--after one listen, you'll wonder why you waited so long!  Everything the other reviewers say is true, including Steve Albini himself.  This CD is, in a word, perfect. <br /> <br />I will say this:  Spiderland affected producer Steve Albini so deeply, he formed another one of his \\"crazy, self-indulgent\\" bands and based it primarily on the foundation of Slint's sound.  He called this new band SHELLAC.  Shellac's first CD, \\"At Action Park,\\" almost sounds like Spiderland part II, (\\"Bosche's dick\\" is a song about Slint's sound guy; they also had help from Slint techy Jennifer Hartman) as Steve and his band mates recreate and nearly pick-up where Slint left off after their 1992 break up.   <br /> <br />Shellac (and other bands like it) are influenced so deeply by Slint, their recordings almost sounds like an homage.  But don't call Shellac posers or copy-cats; the members of Slint were playing hard core and punk in the mid-80's, as was Steve Albini and his bands Big Black and Rapeman (which coincidentally included Jesus Lizard's bass player in its line-up). In fact, these artists are so closely and simultaneously linked, where else will you find a label claiming analog recordings rule?  Only on a Slint or Big Black recording, my friend.
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence has potential. 'My Immortal', 'Bring Me To Life', and some other songs with piano accompaniments worked nicely, I think. 'My Immortal' is the only saving grace in this album. The piano was played soulfully, and the singing was hauntingly beautiful.  <br /> <br />Sadly, the guitars and drums were rather dull. The sound quality is too mainstream to be unique and fresh.  Evanescence should decide what they REALLY want to be: goth, or mainstream pop. This in-between style they're doing is not working. I say they should write more songs like 'My Immortal', I was so disappointed that they didn't [in this album].
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|What a great album from this young band! The songs are not as catchy as some other commercial bands but if you give them 2-3 listens they will stick to your head like glue! <br /> <br />The singer is only 17 years old but has an awesome and powerful voice that fits right into the music. <br /> <br />All in all, a great album and I cant wait for the band's next cd! <br /> <br />Fav tracks: <br /> <br />All we know, Pressure, Brighter, Here we go again. <br />

B00005JOFO|5.0|I saw this a film a couple weeks ago and I just can't seem to shake the deep feelings it invokes in me.  When I was just 15 I saw Franco Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet,  and couldn't sleep at all that night. Titanic brought a similar feeling and now Brokeback Mountain.. What can I say?  It is simply a Masterpeice and should win every award it is nominated for at the oscars.  I am a 51 year old grandmother,  and I just wonder what this movie could accomplish if the right people would suppress their fears long enough to give it a chance.  This is the kind of film that can help change the World- and the world badly needs expressions of complete and utter love such as this!  I just can't praise it enough!

B000002UUX|5.0|Being a jazz freak, i was a little apprehensive of this record, but one my friend got a high from this album and was raving about the lightning fast riffs, tempo changes, texture etc.  So i decided to give it a try and boy did it blow my mind.  I listened to their later efforts and they were perhaps lacking the cutting edge they gave in their earlier efforts, and this album is definitely the pinnacle of not only speed metal, but may be the entire metal genre itself.
B00004SAAX|5.0|This set of many Bach's Organ works by Helmut Walcha is, in my opinion, the greatest recording of these immortal treasures. There are almost all of Bach's Preludes and Fugues for organ, as well as many fantasias, miscallenous works and his chorals for this instrument. Walcha plays with utmost respect to the original scores, his playing is clear and powerful. Many other organists have allowed themselves quite a bit of experiment with these pieces (likes of Ton Koopman are over the top), but in the end, i've always came back to Walcha's renditions. If you want to treat yourself with some of the greatest music ever written, then get this rare set! Bach's organ music can be challenging at first, especially the fugues, and many of my friends have complained that they hear nothing else than noise in these pieces. I suppose you have to have listened this kind of music for quite some time, before you can wholly appreciate these unique pieces. But once you have, you find a world full of riches and wonder, world which only Bach can bring you. And this is a world i wouldn't change for any riches in the world.
B00005T30L|1.0|My wife picked this movie up from Blockbuster but I was surprised how hopeless and despairing this movie is for our youth. The story is about a young person who does not fit in with her peers. The acting is very poor and the end of the movie has no real point.
B00005JOGU|5.0|Ostensibly \\"Capote\\" is the story of Truman Capote writing \\"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences,\\" about the 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas.  The book is considered a landmark in American letters for epitomizing, if not creating (as Capote claimed), the new genre of the non-fiction novel, wherein the traditional conventions of literature were applied to a crime story.  However, by the time we fade to black and get to the title cards that let us know the rest of story, it becomes clear that \\"Capote\\" is trying to provide insights as to why the author of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" never finished another novel.  Publishing the novel changed American literature, but writing it changed Capote.<br /><br />When the Clutters are murdered, Capote reads of the story in \\"The New York Times\\" and decides he wants to write about it for \\"The New Yorker.\\"  The editor, William Shawn (Bob Balaban), agrees and Capote heads for Kansas.  He connects with the head of the investigation, Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), through his wife, Marie Dewey (Amy Ryan), who is dazzled by a celebrity from New York City.  Capote does not care if the killers are caught or not, but Alvin Dewey does.  Once Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are captured, convicted, and sentenced to death, Capote's biggest concern is keeping the two murderers alive long enough to hear what happened that night.  He helps get them new lawyers for a series of appeals, trying to get Smith, the one of the pair with whom he has established a real rapport, to provide the details.  In time that will happen, but then a horrified Capote realizes he cannot complete the book because Smith and Hickock are still alive and the story will not be over until they are executed.<br /><br />Capote is accompanied to Kansas by his friend, Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), who in 1959 has recently finished her book about children and a dead bird, and is trying to find a publisher.  I am drawn to the irony that Capote and Lee worte what are arguably the two most important books produced in my life time, yet neither wrote another (and there are those who claim Capote co-authored her book).  I know enough about \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" which was developed from a series of short stories based on incidents in her family history, to accept the idea that Lee had but one novel in her and that when that book is selected novel of the century there is nothing to complain about.  But it is impossible to believe the same of Capote, and the film that bears his name gives us some indication of what is lost when the author gives a public reading from his book and it becomes clear to us that \\"In Cold Blood\\" is as good as Capote claims.<br /><br />In a year when three of the Oscar nominations for Best Actor are based on not only real people but famous people whose way of talking (and singing) are well known, Hoffman's performance stands out for the moments when we are not listening to Capote's affected speech.  It does not take long in the film to distinguish between the Capote of the cocktail parties, when he clearly knows he is on stage and the one that can be persuasive when out and about in the real world.  But for me the key moments are when Capote is silent, observing and reacting to people and things.  If Hoffman wins the Best Actor Oscar tomorrow night as is expected, part of it will be because of the respected body of work he has produced in films over the last decade, but the majority will be because of this finely nuanced performance that is so far removed from the caricature it could have been that we accept him as Capote and are suitable impressed.publisher.

B00000IOSU|4.0|First of all, Sarah's voice range is so awesome I fell under her spell.  Her self-written lyrics are so true to life and are enhanced by her beautiful voice.  There were a couple of technical glitches in the CD.
B000001IPP|2.0|I loved Operation Ivy immensly so I was so disappointed by how lame Rancid is. This album is pretty lame and its one of their best. After hearing Tim sing on this album I realized why they needed Jesse as lead singer in Op Iv. Now Tim is in that horrible \\"Transplant\\" band with the lame Blink 182 guy. Not to mention he's friends with that loser from GOOD CHARLOTTE!!! And the new Rancid music is sooooooo poesur. Ugggggghhhh. Although some of these songs are catchy they are all non-political and non-offensive. A lame excuse for punk rock, I probably would have liked Rancid back when I used to listen to Green Day.
B000CBSHK2|4.0|You can get a good idea of what this CD sounds like by looking at the cover. The sound is earthy and organic, stripped of previous trip-hop influences. The overall tone is darker than before and a bit monochromatic. There are some rainbows, but they aren't bright and colorful. The feel is like Autumn, sitting warm by the hearth and contemplating the comfort of...  <br /> <br />This is not as readily accessible as Beth's previous CDs. It does not come out and grab you on the first go round. You will want to give it a number of listens and let it grow on you before making your final judgment.  <br /> <br />LIsten to the samples of \\"Absinthe\\", \\"Safe In Your Arms\\", \\"Conceived\\" and \\"Rectify\\" to check this reviewers sensibilities. The best track is \\"What We Begin\\", available as a bonus track on the limited edition. (The other four bonus tracks were left off the original CD for good reasons.)
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is a great movie! Both Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen give great performances. Rosamund Pike as the elder sister, Jane, is a delight. Simon Woods as Bingley is wrongly portrayed as rather foolish, but he is absolutely cute and adorable about Jane, so it's all good. Claudie Blakely (Charlotte Lucas/Collins) gives a much more sympathetic performance than any other Charlotte before her. The friendship between Lizzy and Charlotte feels totally right and believable. <br />I feel it is my duty to warn you that the ending scenes are very close to horrendous, at least to Janeites. The dialogue is cheesy, and the second proposal is in the early morning, with both Lizzy and Darcy in their nightclothes. Darcy especially made me cringe. When the movie all of a sudden jumps from Mr. Bennet's consent to Pemberley, you have to cringe again. And then grit your teeth when Darcy and Lizzy are again in their nightclothes, and saying lines that are so syrupy you want to laugh, but have to cry b/c it's P+P that this crew is messing up. <br />There are many things wrong with the movie, but I love a lot of things in it too. For instance, when Lizzy sees Darcy at Rosings. The scene when Bingley and Darcy practice Bingley's proposal to Jane. The scene when, in church, Fitzwilliam tells Lizzy about Darcy's separation of Bingley and Jane. <br />A must for die-hard Janeites, just ignore the ending.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This is a great film with a story which needs to be heard by the \\"First World\\".  However, I was disappointed in it as it didn't compare well with the book.  The book shows that, even in this upmteenth novel, LeCarre has not lost the touch he showed in \\"The spy Who Came In From the Cold\\" or \\"Tailor, Tinker ...\\".  Whether due to time constraints (the book was 450 pages long) or bowing to pressure from the producer or financiers, the \\"edge\\" in the book is missing from the film.  The character of Tessa is reduced in intensity so that she becomes just another \\"incensed protester\\" instead of the woman who risks her life and perhaps her husband's career to improve the lot of African women whom she meets.  Her role in the African Womans' Movement is completely eliminated from the story.  The story, as noted, is a series of flashbacks showing Justin Quayle, in the person of Ralph Fiennes, trying to \\"find\\" the real personna of his late wife in the face of British authorities in Africa and in the Foreign Office who insist on ruining her reputation and portraying him as a \\"cuckold\\".  This is done to undermine the investigative work she had included in a mysterious report which has disappeared under the watchful eye of said diplomats.  Also missing, again perhaps due to time constraints, is the really chilling human lawnmower aspect of the pharmaceutical company security people as they move across the world eliminating each person who offers another piece of the puzzle to Justin. <br /> <br />The acting is wonderful.  Rachel Weitz won a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Tessa, and Fiennes is his usually great self.  Also giving a  fine performance is Terry Huston as a man who lost himself as he rose higher in the diplomatic core and is now the Acting High Commissioner of the British presence in Kenya.  However,  I was disappointed in Bill Nighy's performance as Peregrime.  A Peregrime is a hunting falcon, and the person in the book is just so deadly and final in his pursuits.  Nighy, whom I love, whether as Viktor in \\"Underworld\\" or as the aging rocker in \\"Love Actually\\" in Peregrime comes across more as a slightly edgier, more dangerous version of his role in \\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" instead of the cruel sleeze masquerading as a polished British diplomat.  In the postscript to the book, we are told that this man retires from his post and takes a position with the pharmaceutical company which is at the center of Tessa's investigation.   <br /> <br />So my advice is see this film, then read the book.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|You can hardly do better! A total must for period drama and literature lovers. Richard Armitage has inspired a HUGE fan base from this miniseries alone. He gives an incrediblely nuanced performance as John Thornton.  <br /> <br />I absolutely love the sets! Very authentic. The inside of the mills are especially beautiful. It looks like winter in there!
0142406112|4.0|This book, was a very good beginning to what I hope will be a great series to read. The 14-year-old trying to be a kid, but knowing that he never will be able to jsut be a kid again is great. Its a young James Bond, but one who is not there on his own free will, at least at first it seems. I can't wait to read the rest of the books, that are out, and are yet to come out, and I might watch the film when it is released, this August. You won't be disappointed parent, if you give it to your child, as its quite tame in the teen market, no sex, and just enough violence to make sense in a spy novel. Its fun for all ages, and Horowitz seems to have a good style ot his writing, its not to young, nor to old for almost anyone to read. Have Fun with this people.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|I wasn't particularly impressed with this film. It's more like a mystery than a character study about the nature of love and betrayal: you'll be investigating whose words mean anything, looking for signs of true emotion. <br /> <br />We have four youngish, unattached people in the unfortunate, but hardly tragic, situation of being in relationships, but in fact \\"fancying\\" other people. For some odd reason, it doesn't occur to them to just simply leave the partner they are not interested in. One guy cheats on girlfriend for a year before he decides to leave her, one of the women actually marries a guy in the middle of her affair with another guy (don't want to give away the names here, it's part of the detective work). <br /> <br />The characters tell each other they love each other, while lying and cheating, so your detective work must go beyond the words. Another step could be to see who tells the truth to whom - perhaps that's a sign of true emotion. But one of the characters has no truth to tell (because he has no emotions I can detect) and another tells the truth to the guy she doesn't love. <br /> <br />Other reviewers called this a character study. True, there is no plot, but for an adapted play the characters are remarkably flat. Many talk about the brutal honesty of the film (yes, there is quite a bit of coarse language having to do with sex, but it doesn't bother me and I wouldn't categorize it as honesty), but there was only one split second when I, the viewer, was actually touched by what was going on on screen: the end of Larry and Anna's conversation in their apartment. Clive Owen is very good. <br /> <br />I investigated, figured things out and was left completely unmoved. In the mystery genre, I would have rated this film higher. In a character study about emotions, this was mediocre. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006JQU1|4.0|Very nice sound and tuning, perfect style. Very good recording. The reason I don't rate it 5 stars it's because I fell a lack of character throughout the cd. That's why, although I don't like them for the sound nor style, the old guys like Milstein and Szeryng still cativate me. They have created really unique interpretations. Don't missunderstand me. I really enjoy this record it is outstanding!
B000683VI4|5.0|<br />It's been quite a while since I enjoyed a good love story. This one really moved me, and I would certainly recommend it. It was nice to James Garner on the screen. I haven't seen a movie with him in it, in years. The story wasn't your typical love story, but had some unique elements. I really did enjoy it.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Lucas does a good job introducing the characters highlighted in the second trilogy.  It is interesting to see the beginning of established characters like Yoda and Obi Wan while being introduced to figures alluded to in the first trilogy.  The advancements in CG add an extraordinary element to the story.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|For those of us who are still mourning the absence of really great 'space' films that have a heart, buy SERENITY immediately for a fulfilling fix!  I am one of those people who went into mourning when 'Farscape' was cancelled.  I also loved all the Star Trek series AND of course, 'StarWars'.  SERENITY is another outstanding addition to that genre.  You have characters that you care very much for, a lot of action, the requisite Sci Fi monsters, space scenes with a lot of futuristic gismos and that beloved touch of romance.  This movie was so good that when it was over, I felt as if I had only been watching it for ten minutes.  In fact, I had to watch all the extras, both with and without Joss' commentary!      I have always thought of Joss Whedon as a creative genius.  I watched every single \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\".  The shows were all so cleverly written and highly addicting!  Besides having snappy storylines and wonderful, fleshed out personalities, Joss has   something else in his stories:  Clearly defined 'good' and 'evil' characters.  And, the theme is always good over evil.  Fortunately the good guys won in this film and I hope they will have many more battles to conquer.  I for one will be watching.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I saw all three LOR movies in the theatre and it was worth the time and wait.  I played D&D when I was young, but this was so much better.  The costumes, acting and scenery were superb.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I really feel it is unfair that so many people are comparing this movie to the excellent miniseries starring Collin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. You simply cannot fit the same amout of character development and plot detail in a 2+ hour movie that you can in a 5+ hour miniseries. And I think (shock) there are some things that this movie does better than the Firth version. One is (some of) the casting. For example I liked Mr. Collins, Charlotte Lucas, and Mrs. Bennett better in this version, because I think the actors were able to bring empathy for previously one-dimensional characters. Now I won't pretend to compare the lead actors between versions, but I don't think anyone disgraced themselves. <br />Yes there were some things about this movie that were historically inaccurate or not faithful to the book, but again, you cannot fit all the content of a book into a film. Come on, people!! The one thing that really bugs me about this version is the final scene, with its chessy and un-Austen-like dialogue. But other than that, I think watching this film is a most enjoyable way to spend the afternoon. And it might even introduce more readers to Jane Austen who have been intimidated by previous versions. And that would be all to the good, certainly.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|First of all I must say, I LOVE the BBC version of this story with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. They set the standard for the telling of this story, hands down. Now having said that, I must say that watching this version, I had to adjust myself to the thinking that this is a different retelling of this story. This is a more primitive, faster paced telling than the BBC version. Now personally, I think that cheats the story, rich as it is, and the portrayal of Bingley being a dolt-that seemed uncalled for. But that being noted, it's not bad. It's watchable if you think of this as the MTV version of a classic, revised and motivated to attract minds with the attention span of a gnat, not a faithful portrayal of JA's story for the masses. The masses need to watch the version with Firth and Ehle. I bought this with an open mind, and other than a few slight annoyances (did everything have to look so dirty?), I wasn't disappointed.  <br /> <br />My test of approval is \\"Will I watch it again\\"? Yes, I will...
B00005JOFO|5.0|When Jack is standing by the campfire, Innis comes up behind him and puts his arms around him.  Innis says with, great tenderness. \\"Come Jack, You're like an old horse, asleep on your feet.\\"   Innis is unable to show emotion unless it is torn out of his gut.  This moment shows what Innis would have been, his true self, if his life had been different.  This if one of the defining moments of the film for me.  His parents had died and his siblings didn't have room for him.  And, of course, his father showed his children awful things.  This is not to say that he wouldn't have been homosexual.
0440241588|3.0|While John Grisham's latest book The Broker was not one of his best books it was still an ok read. It still has the wit that we are used to seeing in his books and I definitely got quite a few chuckles out of it. However the characters in the book do not have the depth that we are used to seeing in his characters.<br /><br />Most of the book takes place in Italy where former lawyer Joel Backman is in hiding. At one time he was a very powerful man in Washington DC. His life changed when three students discovered the most powerful satellite surveillance system in the world (quite by accident), got greedy and tried to sell to the highest bidder - using Joel Backman as their broker. When the story breaks and he is caught those involved start turning up dead. Backman decides that the best way to save his life is to accept the plea agreement and hide out in prison.<br /><br />Six years later he is unexpectedly pardoned by a lame duck president on his way out of office, no explanation is given. He is whisked off to Italy, given a new identity and taught a new language. What Joel doesn't know is that his own country is setting him up to be murdered. They are just going to sit back and see who does it, hoping that this will tell them who invented the satellite system.<br /><br />The book takes a slow turn at this point. We join Backman on a tour from Italian town to Italian town complete with lessons in language and the history of the town. There is also a little romance involved though it is very discreet and not the main focus of the book. As usual Grisham is very convincible and knowledgeable sounding on his subject matter. He makes a very plausible case for the conspiracy theorist who thinks that the government is out to get us all.<br /><br />By the end of the book the leisurely tours of Italy are over and we are back to the cat and mouse chase that Grisham is famous for. But by this time it is too late to really redeem the book. You spend a lot of the book wondering when the plot is actually going to thicken, sadly it never does.<br /><br />While it wasn't a \\"couldn't put it down\\" book it was one that I would have probably still have purchased - even knowing what I know.ndering when the plot is actually going to thicken, sadly it never does.  <br /> <br />While it wasn't a \\"couldn't put it down\\" book it was one that I would have probably still have purchased - even knowing what I know. <br />
B00005Y228|3.0|As you know \\"Fever\\" was very much Kylie's comeback album. It went 7x Platinum in Australia and 5x Platinum in the UK. My favourite Kylie album is \\"Impossible Princess\\", which was released in 1997, and since then her music has been way to commercial, and not very original/creative, and this is one of the many reasons I prefer her sister, Dannii.<br /><br />The album opens with the horrible \\"More More More\\" - it is a filler at best. It has a repetitive beat, and doesn't go anywhere at all, and is very boring. \\"Love At First Sight\\" is a fun pop song, but because of its simplicity, is not very durable and I got sick of it very quickly. \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" is a song you should know by now, as it was the 3rd highest selling single in the world in 2001. It is very catchy, and I quite like it, but again, it is incredibly simple. \\"Fever\\" is the most corny-est song on this album. It is far too up-tempo, and 'gay' for me (sorry, I couldn't think of a better word). \\"Give It To Me\\" is a nice contrast to the other mid-tempo (except for track 4) tracks. It brings some much needed energy back into this pop/dance album. It has a hard and pulsating beat, and the song is very different and would sound great in a nightclub.<br /><br />\\"Fragile\\" is another filler, that again, is too slow, simple, repetitive and boring for me, and it goes nowhere and has corny lyrics. On a positive note, it is the albums main ballad - not that none are needed. \\"Come Into My World\\" is another good song, but again, it is not very good for repeated listens as it is simple. It is still a very good song though, with a great video (CGYOOMH is fantastic also) and is an imaginative song. \\"In Your Eyes\\" is quite a good song, which brings some much needed energy back into this album, which, by this time, would be getting a bit dull.<br /><br />Thankfully, the bets 'third' of this album is the last third, which features some of my favourite Kylie songs on this album, and of her career. \\"Dancefloor\\" is a fun, fast-tempo song which does go somewhere and has enough contrast to stop it from being boring after repeated listens (like many of the above tracks). \\"Love Affair\\" follows and is far and away the best song from this album, and is one of my top-10 favourite Kylie songs (most songs in this 'list' would be from her 1997 album). I cannot explain it very well, but it is different, daring, it definitely goes somewhere, and would have made an excellent single. It is a techno/dance song, not really pop. \\"Your Love\\" is the albums best 'slow' song, and I think this is the only slow/ballad type of song that actually works here. \\"Burning Up\\" closes the album very uniquely, and I really love this song too - my second favourite from the album - listen to it with an open mind.<br /><br />Therefore, this album lacks the energy and creativity that made the Kylie album \\"Impossible Princess\\", and her sisters albums (I hate comparing them, but this is the best example) \\"Girl\\" and \\"Neon Nights\\" so great<br /><br />6.5 / 10is a fun, fast-tempo song which does go somewhere and has enough contrast to stop it from being boring after repeated listens (like many of the above tracks). \\"Love Affair\\" follows and is far and away the best song from this album, and is one of my top-10 favourite Kylie songs (most songs in this 'list' would be from her 1997 album).

B000002AGE|4.0|On the one hand, those who don't remember the 70s don't have to deal with any of the negative associations with the memories of the decade and the cultural things to come out of it.  But we young people also don't have the benefit of remembering when something was fresh and new, revolutionizing that particular part of the culture.  This pertains to this album in terms of the second track, \\"A Remark You Made.\\"  It's a ballad with some really pretty melodic lines and interesting harmonies.  The problem is, this album (and this tune in particular) was apparently so popular that it spawned an entire wave of what we today call \\"smooth jazz.\\"  Today, one has to listen to \\"A Remark You Made\\" through the filter of Kenny G and those who took more lyrical fusion and watered it down for commercial success.  Joe Zawinul is a musical genius to the extent that he could pull off a tune like this and have it not be sappy or cheezy.  Kenny G is not.  But the latter drags down the work of the former in that association.  I cannot listen to Wayne Shorter's beautiful soprano saxophone without lamenting that to which it gave way, and so I don't like \\"A Remark You Made.\\" <br /> <br />However, with an open mind, the rest of this album does not suffer from the spectre of Kenny G, with the possible exception of \\"Harlequin,\\" though the tune is interesting enough to escape that association.  \\"Birdland\\" of course is a classic (though I've heard it so many times that I just start this album at \\"Teen Town\\" whenever I listen to it).  I think \\"The Juggler\\" is the best of Zawinul's world music atmospheric projects.  But the real gem of this album is the closing track, \\"Havona.\\"  Penned by Jaco Pastorius, it begins with the usual Weather Report synthesized fanfare but breaks into a jazz pseudo-samba with harmonies pulled from post-bop but a section with rock sensibilities and propulsion.  The tune is merely good, but the musicianship on display is absolutely PHENOMENAL.  Listen to Jaco's brilliant bass lines behind Wayne Shorter's solo (that's right, there are individual solos in which Zawinul plays acoustic piano, Shorter cuts loose, and Jaco just kills everyone).  The tune absolutely cooks, looking back at post-bop performances of the highest caliber, looking ahead to new sounds and technology, and all the while remaining totally within the scope of the Weather Report sound.  I do not hesitate to call this performance my favorite in Weather Report's entire discography. <br /> <br />I would give this album 5 stars but for the fact that I no longer listen to \\"Birdland\\" (overkill) and I could never listen to \\"A Remark You Made.\\"  I highly recommend this album (it's a classic) BUT not as a bridge into fusion from rock or classic jazz.  I came from hard-bop and heard this as very cheesy the first couple of times through.  It was a year later before I listened closely and found the creative brilliance that exists here.  From a jazz background, start with the early Weather Report albums, their self titled debut and \\"I Sing The Body Electric.\\"  They are very different, and more of an extension of electric Miles.  Then work your way on up to this album to appreciate the growth this band underwent.  From rock, try \\"Tale Spinnin'\\" and \\"Black Market,\\" the two albums before this one.  They are funkier and prepare you for the colors and textures used on this album.  But be sure to do whatever is necessary to appreciate this album, because it's worth it.
B00005J8JL|5.0|GREAT CD ONE OF ZEPPELINS BEST ALL GREAT SONGS, NOT JUST WHAT YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO.
B000009RC2|5.0|Early fusion took one of two paths: it was either highly exploratory of different electric sounds (like early Weather Report and Herbie Hancock's Mwandishi) or it was highly charged and rock influenced.  Mahavishnu Orchestra was the latter.  John Mclaughlin on guitar was one of the first of Miles Davis's sidemen to find his own expression in the genre.  Using distortion on his guitar and great volume levels, this music is similar to arena rock and could even be cited as a very early precursor to heavy metal.  But it's quite a bit more sophisticated than that; brilliant drummer Billy Cobham plays loudly, but it's not just about bashing cymbals.  He and the rest of the band sustain highly original rhythmic grooves, usually in odd time signatures.  The tunes, all composed by John Mclaughlin, are usually riff-based, short rhythmic and melodic statements that get repeated and stretched into tunes.  Though this may sound like it would get repetitive, it doesn't; the tunes, though simply constructed, are complex and extremely energetic, and the musicianship is at such a high level that one doesn't even realize there isn't more written than there is. <br /> <br />Highlights of this album are \\"Vital Transformation\\" in 9/8 time, with its churning one-measure repeated riff being turned inside out and having the intensity level brought way up, only to release into a bridge of compelling ascending chords over a suspended rhythmic pattern.  My personal favorite is \\"The Dance of Maya\\" in 10/8 with a fascinating ascending pattern of single notes with a release into the funkiest shuffle in the history of funky shuffles, though the odd time signature is sustained.  The most glorious moment of the whole album is when the bluesy melody is repeated at the end over the shuffle while the initial single note pattern returns underneath it, casting the same riff in a totally new light. <br /> <br />This album is accessible to anyone who doesn't mind guitar distortion or loud rock-like music.This is the perfect bridge for a rocker to cross into jazz, more so than even Herbie Hancock's \\"Headhunters,\\" but be forewarned that once you get drawn in, this music is so compelling you'll never be able to go back.
B00005JOWF|4.0|Sometimes you just have to suspend disbelief. At first I thought this film was a bit hokey--particularly because the trailer looked so cool--but then I realized it is what it is. By that I mean, the film goes out of its way--especially in the opening title and credits--to make sure you know and understand what you are about to see is a live-action depiction of a comic book. Hence, the simple story of good vs. evil, and conflicted heroine straddling the gray area of existence (humans vs. vampire [if you will]), transcends disebelief with (sartorial) style. I can't say they weren't well-dressed and color coordinated! Yes it's a bit formulaic, ala \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"Kill Bill,\\" and even \\"Highlander\\" (the ending), but it holds its own as a comic book heroine coming to life for our entertainment. Just enjoy it for what it is!
1563894696|4.0|I got a taste of this particular Batman story when I purchased the film \\"Batman Begins\\" in a special two-disc DVD from Amazon.com. With it came a small book that had the first part of Batman: The Long Halloween! After I got that taste, I wanted the whole tale! <br /> <br />This story basically shows the end of gangster rule in Gotham City and the beginning of the Rogue's Gallery being the main villians! We also get a glimpse of the different views of justice from Batman, Commisioner Gordon and D.A. Harvey Dent's point of view. The latter's viewpoint is what ultimately led to his tragic turn into the criminal Two-Face. <br /> <br />Very good Batman tale. I would also recommend getting Batman: Year One and Batman: Dark Victory with this because they seem to be based on each other and would make a very good continuty tale on their own. Good recommendation!

Researching the music of Gorillaz, I found a most bizarre, ecclectic compilation of body-moving music that touches all my senses and range of moods of the day. Thanks to Amazon.com, I'm the proud owner of all their CDs. Truly groundbreaking work. Jamie Hewlett's topnotch animation is just the icing on the cake.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|once again, peter jackson wows us with another one of his great big over the top movies. fresh of his LOTR victory, jackson has now turned his gaze to the 1930 classic king kong making it longer (about 190+ minutes long) bigger (big mad ape) and more spectacular (can we say dinosaur fights anyone?) this is what you'll get for king kong. the film is just like the old version but is mainly divided into three sections. the first is in new york were we meet anne darrow, a struggling actress who might hit it big when carl denham (in a role were its hard to belive jack black is being serious) ask her to star in his film produced buy her idol, producer jack driscoll. then it moves into the second part of the film, skull island and here is were the action takes off as we meet the movies BIG star. then it moves to the third part of the film were kong is taken back to new york and then you know the rest, ape captures girl, ape climbs to the top of building, planes shoot ape down, everyone crys, the end. the one thing that surprised me was king kong was not the big hollywood cash cow of winter, instead chronicles of narnia and HP4 (no surpries) became the real big winners but then again it would be pretty hard to sit through a three hour long film about a ape, so i dont blame you but still, its now on DVD that way you can pause the film when you have to go to the bathroom. so see jacksons next triumph.
B000AP04FG|3.0|This film is sort of a remake combination of the Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner movie, \\"The War of the Roses,\\" and the Jamie Lee Curtis/Arnold Schwartneger film, \\"True Lies.\\"  While the former relied upon outrageous behavior and very good dialogue and the later on action and explosions, Mr. and Mrs. Smith relies more on over-the top violence.  Despite the extremes, however, I felt the film was rather bland and predictable.  Both Mr. Pit and Ms Jolie have done better characterizations in other films, but I didn't really care for either of their characters in this film.  I found it difficult to believe that two people who were so passionate at the beginning would be so boring and indifferent after marriage.  I also couldn't believe that anyone could live five--oops six--years together without any kind of attachment until they were challenged by \\"bad guys.\\" That the two characters were simply psychopathic I could believe, but in that case I'm surprised that one didn't \\"off\\" the other long before the marriage counseling stage.  By the time they got to the point of trying to save themselves from becoming victims of their respective agencies, I had long ceased to care if they made it or not.  Strictly for those who like gunshots and explosions.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|A charming, wonderful movie in its own right.  Brilliantly cast, and well acted.  I loved it.   It captures the essence of Pride and Prejudice.  I didn't want it to end when it was over.  It was filmed beautifully.  And if it wasn't my favorite book, if I didn't know the story so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed the `rushing' through the storyline.  Feelings aren't developed, can't be developed, within this kind of a short format.  Circumstances and emotions that took days, weeks, or months to develop in the book seem to transpire instantaneously in this movie.  The passage of time is not well represented.  Some characters that definitely add depth are cut out of the plot completely.  Where is Mr. Hurst, for example, eating, drinking, and sleeping to excess?  Mrs. Hurst?  Charlotte's sister Maria?  Aunt Phillips?  Mr. Collins doesn't get to develop his idiosyncracies appropriately.  And my favorite narcissist of all time, Lady Catherine De Bourgh, played by a phenomenal actress this time out (Dame Judi Dench), doesn't get to fuss, brag, and command as she ought.  If you want the nuance, the humor, and the character development, you have to read the original book or watch either the BBC or the A&E production.  However, this was a delightful movie taken alone, without comparison.  This adaption would be an especially good introduction to Pride and Prejudice.  Austen lovers, like me, will love it, too, even though it is slightly truncated.  I recommend it.  And the extras were also very interesting.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|There is something in this movie for everyone, and by that I mean there is something in this movie to offend just about everyone. Whatever your political or ideological leanings, the creators of South Park will find a way to turn them into mince meat. If you are someone who takes themselves (or their politics) very seriously, this movie is definitely not for you. But if you are someone who can have a good laugh at their own expense (and doesn't mind lots of gross-out humor), this may be the movie for you. <br />The story centers around Gary, a broadway actor who is recruited by Team America to help in the fight against the terrorists, led by the evil Kim Jong Il. Basically this is a spoof of the typical hollywood action movie, complete with over the top action sequences and lame character exposition. There is even a hilarious scene dedicated to the \\"montage\\". (\\"Show a lot of things happening at once, remind everyone of whats going on. Montage!) <br />Parker and Stone are at their funniest however when they are skewering the beliefs of mainstream America. In one particularly funny scene, Michael Moore is walking around with a hotdog in each hand ranting about \\"radical action against the fascists.\\" Throughout the movie, Team America faces opposition at home in the form of a group of concerned hollywood actors known as the Film Actors Guild (FAG). Fear not though, liberals, because the conservative camp gets its share of lampooning as well. In a later scene the very conservative Team America is characterized as \\"reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks\\". <br />I couldn't give this movie 5 stars, simply because sometimes the humor goes too far over the top, being outrageously offensive without trying too hard to be funny. But there are more than enough good laughs to make this movie worth the watch.

0780622553|4.0|I couldn't say I was more surprised. I loved this movie. You should get this movie. Surprise ending, you might not see this coming. The director of Crow, did it again. Another great movie to sit down and watch.
B0002XVQNU|1.0|I would like to mention this movie.  The music is godawful.  Brilliant New York attourney listens to teenie-booper pitty party music when he is feeling pissy.  Every action scene is backed by horrible, cheesey teen-angst metal music or white-boy rap.  Yuck.  So, what you have here is an already terrible movie that is rendered almost completely unwatchable by its vomit-inducing soundtrack.
B00005JO04|4.0|I won't try to restate or expand upon previous reviews found here for Syriana.  Many contributors have offered a better reviews of the content of Syriana than I could describe. <br /> <br />But I will point out that whether Syriana is for you or not, has more to do with the movie-goer, than the movie itself. <br /> <br />Consider: <br />1) Can you check your political prejudices at the front door? <br />2) Are you willing to attempt to follow four \\"chess games\\" simultaneously? <br />3) Have you the courage to feel really upset at the end? <br /> <br />If you can answer \\"YES\\" to all three questions, then Syriana may just be one of the most worthwhile movie releases of 2005. <br /> <br />If you answered \\"NO\\" to any of these points, you'd better pass on Syriana.  <br />

B0001WTUH6|4.0|Let's face it-the only people who are going to REALLY like this movie are well, people who like movies like this. <br /> <br />It's been over a year since I saw the original DVD release, but having just caught it on TV last night, I can see why original reviews were less than spectacular. I didn't even really care for it all that much the first time I saw it. It was long on style, but very uneven in storyline. It felt rushed and choppy. And then when a sequel was mentioned, I couldn't figure out why anyone would bother. <br /> <br />Thank god for director's cuts. <br /> <br />It reminded me of when Peter Jackson released his extended cuts of the Rings movies. What had previously been just good movies, became GREAT movies, and all because of just a few minutes here and a few minutes there of extra footage. It completely changed the flow of the film;fleshed it out and made it more complete.  <br /> <br />This is what has happened with Underworld-the inclusion of extra footage and deleted scenes into the original movie has completely changed it. Not only does it look great, but it made the story great. The characters have a history that is understandable and interestingly written. It was a real movie instead of just a stylish goth fantasy. I'm hopeful about the sequel. <br /> <br />If you're an extras junkie like me, you like the supplemental disc stuff. They film the techincal bits in a way that's actually interesting to watch, which can be a challenge. The Fang vs. Fiction special is a hoot to watch. People can be so serious about vampires! <br /> <br /> The unrated extended cut has more than made up for the shortcomings of the original release, and made it a worthwhile buy.
B00097DXZS|4.0|I had more trouble getting the plastic sticker off the box than I did ripping the CD. Apparently under MacOS X there is no root kit or any other copy protection device in use, so if you're a Windows user get one of your Mac buddies to put the tracks on a CD in mp3 format for you and you're good to go. <br /> <br />BTW, it's Sony that shoud be sued, not Santana, for hiding a root kit on a music CD that makes Windows systems even more vulnerable to virus infection. And the \\"remedies\\" they've offered don't even come close to addressing the problem.  <br /> <br />Musically, I like the new Santana sound, just as I like the old Santana sound. The guest artists add extra spice and Carlos' guitar, as always, takes the spotlight often enough to keep me happy. Listen to the demo tracks and decide for yourself (Hint: the tastes at the iTunes music store are longer than they are here on Amazon. But buy the CD in case Jobs decides to alter his copy protection scheme and deny you access to your own music!).
B00005JOWF|3.0|I really don't know what to make of this movie. It's kind of like a combination of an ultra-cool eye candy spectacle mixed with the world's worst acid trip. Not that I've ever done acid, but I think this is what it must be like.  <br /> <br />Comparisons to \\"Aeon Flux\\" are inevitable, and the two movies do share a lot in common. Both rely on the sex appeal of the female leads. Both are set in a futuristic metropolis-like world where the heroine must battle all sorts of baddies. Both contain strange looking devices, gadgets and other items only found in this type of film. But I found \\"Aeon Flux\\" to be a little more cohesive in its script; \\"Ultraviolet\\" goes all over the place with little flow in the plot. And the mind-numbingly bad dialog doesn't help it. <br /> <br />But it does have its good points. This has to be one of the coolest-looking movies I've ever seen. Very short on substance, yes, but visually awesome. And what's not to like about Milla Jovovich? Cameron Bright turns in a fairly standard performance as a kid whose only name is Six. Come to think of it, his performance in this movie is pretty much a carbon-copy of his role in \\"Birth,\\" with that I-know-something-about-you blank stare of his that seems to be becoming his trademark acting style. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Ultraviolet\\" isn't a bad movie, nor is it a particularly good one either. But its eye candy makes up for what it lacks in a plot and characters one can care about. Worth seeing on the big screen, but at a matinee price.
0446310786|4.0|For years, I have heard so much about both this movie and the book.  Having just finished the unabridged audio version of it, I can safely say that both are worth investing your time in.  Written from the point of view of a lawyer's daughter looking back on three years in her childhood, it is very obvious that author Harper Lee drew much of her book from her own life, and her descriptions of both the people and places are probably not just derived from thin air.  In fact, Gregory Peck's performance of Atticus Finch reminded her so much of her father, that she cried on the set of the film!<br /><br />True, this is a story about the cruelties of injustice and prejudice--very anger provoking and often managing to stereotype characters that really probably existed in Lee's world--but it also speaks about the common human condition we all share no matter where we are:  our collective human lack of infallibility.  With some wit, wisdom, and innocence that gives way to grace through the comprehension of human imperfection, we see the lives of Scout, Jem, and Dill unfold in the middle of controversy that need not exist if it weren't for the small minded logic that far too many people possess.  Innocence dies in the face of cruelty--like killing a mockingbird.  This is the reason the children are never the same after witnessing the unfair trial of Tom Robinson and, as one of them observed about Boo Radley, the town recluse, he hid in his house because he wanted to, and sometimes we want to do the same.<br /><br />Our hero Atticus Finch is a bit unbelievable in his overabundance of goodness, but he sets a great role model for his children, and I believe that Harper Lee idolized her father enough that she wrote the book to immortalize and place him on a pedestal.  We all have blind worship for at least one person in our lives, but I think the real purpose of Lee's novel was to stress integrity, honor, and graciousness in all walks of life.  In a world full of adversity, these three things are really all a person has, and the rest is just smoke and mirrors.these three things are really all a person has, and the rest is just smoke and mirrors.
B000BT97AO|4.0|One of the unsung heroes of modern cinema was Jim Henson.  Besides his truly brilliant Muppets, he did have a bit of a dark side.  Anybody who hasn't been wowed and slightly frightened by LABYRINTH, or experienced the beauty and eerie splendor of THE DARK CRYSTAL should run out to the video store and pick them up today. It's amazing he's been gone for a decade.  But after sitting down in my warm easy chair to watch Dave Mckean's darkly powerful MIRRORMASK, the latest film to come from the Jim Henson Company,  I can attest that his legacy of far off worlds and amazing stories still exist.<br /><br />MIRRORMASK  tells the story of a young girl named Helena (Stephanie Leondis).  She's on the verge of becoming and adult, and on the verge of teenage rebellion.  Her father runs a circus that is held together by his dream and not much more. Helena's had it with the circus life and wants to be normal.  As the film opens she has a big fight with her mother on this very subject.  When her mother falls ill later that night, only a risky surgery can save her.  In turn Helena is whisked away to a magical land that is on the verge of falling apart.  Only the Mirrormask can save her world and the mysterious world she's now inhabiting.<br /><br />I've always considered myself a pretty creative guy.  But oh my goodness, where did the magical world of this film come from.  It's like nothing I've ever seen.  I almost think I have to watch it again, because hot darn this place is just marvelous.  Computer graphics, blue screen effects, and wild character make-up are mixed to create a world that is so unique and yet plausible.  There are surprises hiding around corners and every frame is jumping with some new and bizarre set-piece  and characters that just jump out at you.<br /><br />The film, written Sandman creator, creator Neil Gaiman and director McKean, is as close to a comic book, without being totally animated, as you can get.  It's dark and puzzling and yet so amazing.  It's a shame I didn't get to see this on the big screen because it is an awe inspiring work.<br /><br />This film is proof that you don't need a complicated story to make a complicated movie.  In all honesty the story is simple, it could really be the plot of an Afterschool special.  But MIRRORMASK demands to watched because it's visually stunning, and is brimming with creativity.<br /><br />The film dramatic wight rests on young Stephanie Leondis. As Helena she captures the amazement and savvy of a young girl who is about to become a women.  It could be a thankless task for her, the film doesn't really require much.  But there is a self awareness and subtle charm trapped behind this young ladies eyes.  How she is able to craft a such a simple performance and yet not get lost in the world around her is beyond me.  She makes it look easy.<br /><br />But the strongest virtue of this film is that it is a perfect mix of wild imagination and careful plotting.  It allows the story to use its special effects not be overpowered by them.  MIRRORMASK is a very calculated film, it's smart, and yet simple enough for young children.  This movie has a little something for everyone.<br /><br />The music is also quite wonderful.  MIRRORMASK is the kind of movie that I would love to watch without dialogue and just the music score underneath it.  It hit all the right chords without overpowering any of the action.<br /><br />If you liked THE DARK CRYSTAL, LABYRINTH, or ALICE IN WONDERLAND than seek out MIRRORMASK. Trust me it's a visual delight.  It is also one of the most powerfully creative and beautiful films I've ever had the pleasure to watch.t's a shame I didn't get to see this on the big screen because it is an awe inspiring work.    <br /> <br />This film is proof that you don't need a complicated story to make a complicated movie.

B000000OYQ|4.0|All right, anytime there is a review of Jimmy Page you have to tread lightly, especially the post-Zep stuff.  Well, I'm here to tell you that this album is very, very tasty.  Great chops displayed here throughout, any serious fan of Zep or Pagey's playing needs this in their collection. <br /> <br />I don't know what it is, but the man has the tone of the ages, my favorite for sure.  Wow.  This album is worth it for Prison Blues alone, and I'm seeing it for sale used at .99 cents, come one!  No brainer.  Prison Blues is blues as only Pagey can play it, \\"somewhere left of heaven\\" as Plant described it once.   <br /> <br />Great to hear Plant and Page together on one song as well.  Highlights for me are Prison Blues, Emerald Eyes, Liquid Mercury, and the Plant and Page collaboration The Only One. <br /> <br />Play this loud, you won't be disappointed.  Check out The Firm albums as well, and while you're at it pick up The Black Crowes collaboration with Pagey.  Thanks Jimmy, we love ya!
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Beginning with the greatest example of opposites attracting, The Constant Gardener tells the story of two people with different politics converging on the same path of trying to discover a conspiracy involving a pharmaceutical company. <br />Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a fairly prominent British diplomat who tends to keep his opinions to himself.  One day, while delivering a lecture for a colleague, he meets a very liberal, very outspoken woman named Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who openly challenges the content of the lecture.  Justin is rather taken by the young woman, and he offers to take her out after she ends up humiliating herself.  The two hit it off immediately, and they are soon married.  Justin eventually gets sent to Africa, and Tessa asks to come with him.  While there, she befriends Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kound), a native scientist, and they begin investigating a drug company that is selling their newest product in Kenya. <br />All of that is told in a flashback.  Tessa and Arnold are killed within five minutes of the movie, and Justin can barely stand it.  He begins pieceing together the clues left behind by his late wife, who was truly the love of his life, despite their difference of opinions when it came to politics.  He soon learns that she was very close to uncovering a conspiracy involving the drug company and the British government.  The second half of the film follows Justin as he tries to finish Tessa's work and make sure she didn't die in vain. <br />Everything about the film is well-done.  The script is very well-written, and the actors all do fine jobs.  The story is very interesting, and the locations are both hauntingly beautiful and depressing.  The images of poverty and disease in Africa do their job and resonate with the audience. <br />It seems like this film has been somewhat underrated; while critics have praised it, there hasn't been too much of a buzz around it, which is a shame, because it is a very good film.
B00008BXJF|4.0|I'm just getting into the many facets and faces of this band, but felt compelled to share a little blurb with those interested.  Simply put, this is a great, great album.   <br /> <br />How great?  The best compliment that I can pay it is that whenever I listen to it, it's hard for me to find something worthy of following it in the rotation.  Meaning, I need to take a break from music after this album because few compare to the atmosphere, bombasity, and beauty of this piece of work.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it. <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I like this cd!! Its very good when you want to go to sleep or relax...\\"Amerantine\\" is very beautiful song and \\"its in the rain\\" are my two favorite! I also like how the scotish chour sang in the cd...The right kind of theme of enya...for all you new age lovers get this cd!
B000089CJI|5.0|One of my favorite cd's of all time, I only wish that there was more to listen to of this collaboration!  Mellow/happy/thought-provoking/will make you dance.  I think Ben Gibbard's role in the Postal Service is much more effective than as part of DCFC because most of their tunes are too mellow for me but I would recommend \\"GIVE UP\\" to anyone who likes electronica/pop...just listen to a few track samples on here and buy it!
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie was the singularly worst movie experience I've ever had in my life.  The plot and acting were retarded
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series Firefly, is one of my favorites, the only problem is you just start loving it and then it ends.  The first episode is slow, maybe hard to get into, but with the second episode till the end I was hooked, You fall in love with the characters, and the story.  I think the cast was superb, my pregnant cousin is even naming her baby after one of the members.  I do wish there were more episodes but hey, I guess that is why they made the movie Serenity, also a great movie.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed FF7, and this film did a wonderful job bringing the characters from the game back together.  The visuals are absolutely incredible, and seeing Cloud and friends rendered so beautifully was a treat.  In my opinion, they made a *good* sequel which has the same elements of humor, action, and emotion which the game had brought. <br /> <br />Positives of this movie for me include: <br />1. Stunning graphics which make your jaw hang open <br />2. Characters acting just like you remember they did in the game <br />3. A good blend of action and story <br />4. Excellent voice acting (At least in Japanese, I have not seen the English version) <br />5. Cloud's new motorcycle! <br />6. Yazoo's ringtone for his phone. (listen for it) <br />7. An ending which tied things up very nicely. <br /> <br />Negatives of the movie for me include: <br />1. Some of the music, particularly during the battles, did not mesh well with the scenes. <br />2. It was too short!  Just an hour and a half, and I was very sad that it had to end when it did. <br />3. Not enough scenes with Red XIII (aka. Nanaki).  He's my favorite character and really only had one line in the film.   <br /> <br />But seriously, this is an absolute MUST for any fan of FF7.  You HAVE to see it, no exceptions!
B000A5044C|2.0|Watch out folks, this movie is overhyped, and you might just get fooled. This movie receives a firm 2.5 stars from me! Dont be fooled by these other comments here, because they dont know what their talking about. They dont know the difference between a square and a triangle! <br /> <br />The good points: The actor playing \\"AKIRA\\"(Oldest sibling) is phenominal at his roll! Ummm..... and thats pretty much about it.... <br /> <br />The bad points: This movie had the potential to be GREAT but the direction/videoography/music placement was horrible. I heard the same theme song at least 4-5 times throughout the movie. Thats ridiculous! The scenes and angles the director chose were boring, and inaccurate. The director had a huge fetish on shooting at peoples feet!!! What the hell!? <br /> <br />The director did not even let the characters build a relationship. Throughout the movie, you felt like everyone was just friends and not family. The whole film felt like it was rushed. <br /> <br />The only touching thing about the movie is when it was nearing its end. This movie is overhyped and definitely belongs back on japanese shelves. I am never going to watch another film from this director EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0316287059|5.0|Kevin Aucoin was one of the greatest talents. Get this book and have fun with it...
0671027387|4.0|I could not put this book down. At first, I was both interested and sceptic because the story involved things like NASA, military action, U.S. politics, etc. and I was afraid it would be too much of a Tom Clancy style book. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it entirely; the plot is well structured and the story isn't not too incredible :) Recommended entertainment!
B00005JOWF|1.0|What happened? This is not the movie depicted in the previews. <br /> <br />I went into it expecting a special effects packed action flick with very little plot and a whole lot of crazy matrix style crap. In short, exactly what you would think after seeing the preview. <br /> <br />Instead, what I got barely even qualified as an action movie. In several scenes, Voilet simply twists around in a circle, and everyone around her dies, as if by magic. One or two action scenes were notable, specifically when she is dodging bullets in the middle of a large group of shooters, and when fighting with the gun/swords in a very equilibrium-esk fashion. But those two scenes were horribly overshadowed by the \\"different-camera-angle-every-second\\" footage of most of the action, and the just GODAWFUL dialog. I actually was having difficulty not laughing at the script, as it seemed to have been written in the style of \\"twelve-year-olds writing love poetry to their gradeschool crush.\\" The cheesy lines were bad, but the stilted \\"tender\\" moments were so horribly bad that it made the Starwars Episode 2 dialog seem well written in comparison. And the script was made worse by the horribly timing, which was just as painful. This isn't the WORST movie i've ever seen, but its the most disappointing, especially after the badass previews. Im convinced that about halfway through this thing, they scrapped the script and started over ala Ewe Boll, just reusing the same footage in a different order, spliced together to form what seems to be the dumbest storyline EVER.

0156027321|5.0|This story was just amazing. The story has so many levels and I could not stop reading. While I do think that the first few pages were very long winded and I kept wondering what they had to do with the story, everything did pull together at the end, and beautifully at that. I don't really reread books, but this warrants at least one more reading and maybe even more. It was incredible.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is a great movie primarily due to the acting of Phoenix and Witherspoon and of course the music. Although primarily about Cash framed by the tragic consequences of his early family life, the movie centers on the love story of Cash and Carter. As Cash's music career takes off suddenly and dramatically, the lives of Carter and Cash intersect frequently to the point of doing duets together and traveling to the same shows. Captured in a time line out of synch with their own realities, their mutual affections are trapped in marriages in place long before their first meeting.  While Cash's personal life obviously languishes, Carter's also quietly self destructs over the years. In the interim, Cash's bout with pills, road schedules, guilt with his parents (a touch of daddy dearest), love for Carter and most damaging, his own family culminating in a failed marriage takes Cash to the edge of ruin.  Intermingled in this long journey are the strains of a denied love. All the music is amazing, particularly as sung by the two leads. Phoenix does not completely capture the manly roughness of Cash's voice but it is heavily masculine and pure complimenting Cash's sound. Witherspoon is surprising, particularly her singing and she plays a girlish yet strong Carter whose family is there for Cash as well, supplementing the early family support he never had.  A great film and my only critique would be to have had even more song performances. As the film settles itself down appropriately on the famous Folsom prison concert, I wish they ended it with Johnny Cash's original recording of the \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"When I hear that whistle blowin'....\\"

B000B0WODA|3.0|I absolutely love Their first album!  No, it wasn't anything grand or amazing, but it was a fun, light and catchy CD and I played it quite a bit for a few months after it's release.  So, of course, I was eagerly awaiting the release of this because their small Fuse hit 'Do You Want To' was such a catchy, dancable song.  I loved it.  Well, on this one, they try some harder music and it really doesn't work, in my opinion.  It comes off as a little boring, and it sounds like they are trying to hard with this one.  Yes, this one does have it's really awesome songs.  Like 'This Boy', 'Walk Away',  'Well, That Was Easy', 'Ealenor, Put Your Boots On' and 'Do You Want To', but I find the rest of the songs to be quite bland overdone and rushed.  Don't get me wrong.  This WAS worth it's price for those five songs alone, but the others well...I just wasn't fond of them.  This wasn't as entertaining or fun as their last, and I'm really hoping they take more time with their third one.  They probably COULD make some really good harder songs, if they...well...yeah, took their time. Overall, a dissappointment, but still average.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Didn't think that was very possible after I listened to it.  No, these guys ain't anything new at all.  but, they take real cool sounding post-punk new wave and do it really well.  The lyrics are kinda odd sometimes, and make no sense once in a while, but it's all good.  Still a cool CD.  Reccomended for fans of stuff like The Smiths, Gang of Four, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Hot Heat, Interpol, Bloc Party, Richard Hell...stuff like that.

B000001DQI|5.0|Although I'm not a huge Elton John Fan, I feel that this was the pinnacle of his career. You'll be surprised when you listen to it, at how many of the songs you've heard on the radio. <br />The opening song is my personal favorite !
B000C65Z1G|3.0|It seems like the only acceptable villains in the movies these days are big businesses.  In this particular case, it's the pharmaceutical industry...and to tell you the truth, it's a big come down from the days of the Cold War, when life or death for millions of people really did hang in the balance, and gave Le Carre that added frisson of tension to some of his earlier work.  Maybe that's why I went in to this movie expecting so much, and why it was a bit of a let down at the end, not because of the plot, but because of the pretext. <br /> <br />What everyone else has said about the acting is true -- it's very good.  Fiennes is compelling -- he has the quality of internalizing the drama and yet communicating that internal struggle effectively, Weisz is endearing.   <br /> <br />I was a big fan of Mereilles from City of God, I love his sensibility, and the way that he shot the Africa scenes.  However, I think the  pacing of the plot was a little off for some reason.  We didn't finish the movie in one sitting, and my wife could not keep her eyes open.   <br /> <br />Bottom line: this is a good film with great acting, but it's a bit moralistic and pedantic so adjust your expectations accordingly. <br /> <br />
B000001FN3|1.0|This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. <br />Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money.
B0000009RX|1.0|I just recently gave this cd, or whatever it is, a listen and was amazed at the audacity of this man. While I agree with his take on the drug-induced 1960s, I was aghast at his pathetic lampooning of the Beatles-THE BEATLES. I feel that his mocking them might have a certain degree of validity had he been in the same musical league as John Lennon or Paul McCartney, but this clearly is not the case. It's interesting how so many praise this amateur as if he were the music world's second coming of Christ, when in fact, his music is so pathetically substandard.
0670034711|2.0|I would rate this book two stars or less, except for the fact that Gilbert can indeed write. The problem is she's a shallow twit, and what she thinks passes as wisdom earned along her journey is complete twaddle, except that a good meal, good sex and a little peace and quiet can calm the soul. The book reeks with personal details, a level of self conscious confession that sounds more like a narrative from \\"Sex and the City.\\" I hope she feels better after dumping this stuff on us page after page. As a reader, I couldn't thumb through it fast enough.  <br />I found myself growing impatient with her immaturity, and a kind of arrogance that keeps people like her flitting through a spiritual walk, one that is all about what she can get out of it, particularly the need to feel special. Mid-way, I found myself unable to trust her judgement or her journey, so in the end, I found her story more disturbing than inspiring. I thought I was buying a travel book with some interesting insights into these locales. Instead, it really turned out to be a sort of New Age Harlequin romance. Yuck.
0767836286|5.0|One of the most recent unheralded heart-throbbing thrillers of recent years,\\"Arlington Road\\" is one of the best blendings of fact to fiction,an early warning shot across America's bow, warning of a prophetic, closer attack(9/11).Jeff Bridges, as a paranoid professor of American history pays a price for his curiosity.Avoiding government censorship by fictionalizing the Oklahoma bombing and doing the same with the Ruby Ridge incident, it nonethless depicts the FBI for what it has become today. Bridges, as Prof. Faraday, turns to his neighbors when his former FBI cronies cannot.Into this potboiler all elements swirl toward a climactic finish with a disturbing, informed force.

B00005JNRE|5.0|I honestly don't know what to expect from this movie a first but a soon as I have watched it, I have managed to see how stand alone this movie is along with its predecessors such as Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music. I actually have fun watching it!<br /><br />Cedric Brown(Collin Firth) had finally come to his ends of his nerves with his children over their game of \\"get rid of our nannies\\" asap, cause even the agency of Nanny Placement Center had gave up after their most strictest Nanny number 17 quit. In the havoc household, their scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) seemed to be the only one the children could get along with. In desperate need for a nanny to control his evermost naughty children, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) magically appeared in their lives, and with some miracles, the kids were finally under control.<br /><br />Things gotten horrible when they found out their father has gotten broke and the only way to keep the alowance he has been getting their whole lives from great aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), was to get married as soon as possible within the month. in desperation he as no choice but planned to marry Ms Quickly, who is a horrible woman, who only wanted the money from marrying Mr Brown.<br /><br />I can't wait for the DVD version to come out for this one, cause I would really want it to be in my collection.
B00005UW7G|5.0|I will not pretend to be an expert on opera.  I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood in Detroit.  I've appreciated classical music for years but opera never appealed to me at all.  Still, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about.  I figured a movie version with subtitles might be the way to go.  Happily, this was an amazing experience!  <br /> <br />The performances are first rate and the sound quality is excellent.  (If you have a good home theater system the stereo effects will please.)  Sadly, this 1979 release was not filmed in high-def, but the scenery and overall production is still top rate. <br /> <br />As for opera for newbies:  this is a great place to start!  Don G's valet is hilarious (especially when revelaing his master's \\"little\\" black book to the Don's wife!) and the title character is clearly the scoundrel you'll love to hate.  But most of all, the music is amazing; the singing is all emotion.  There's just something very epic about this film.  I'll probably pull it out once a year or so. <br /> <br />If you enjoy classical music and can suspend reality long enough to enjoy \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\", you'll enjoy this!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Ok, I've been a huge fan of Maiden over the last 20 years.  Iron Maiden to me has to have Dickinson and Smith.  It' not Iron Maiden without them.  So obviously I got pretty excited for Brave New World.  It was great to hear them back together for that album, and overall it's a pretty good effort.    Back when Dance of Death was released, I heard Wildest Dreams.  I didn't like it much when I heard it, and I sort of dismissed the album before hearing anything else.  All I can say is that I made a BIG MISTAKE!    So, Wildest Dreams is still pretty weak overall.  But most of the rest of this album is incredibly.  Songs 2 through 5 quickly make you forget about song #1.  Rainmaker is short by Maiden standards, but sets things up really nicely for the rest of the album.  They should have led off with that tune.  No More Lies is just insanely good.  Montsigur is classic Maiden that truly rocks.  Dance of Death is unbelievable.  Throw in Paschendale, and you already have an album that tops just about everything out there.    So, I thought I had it all figured out, those were the best tracks on the album.  Then, listening to the entire album in the background a week ago while working around the house, Face in the Sand is playing.  As I start listening a bit closer, it pulls me in.  This song is fantastic as well, so now that one is in the rotation.    Two days ago, same situation, except Age of Innocence is on and I start to listen a bit closer.  Unreal, another amazing song that I just kind of overlooked.  This one isn't typical Maiden, but is fantastic none the less.  The January 2, 2006 review nailed it, check out the Dave Murray guitar solo.  Really great stuff.    As for comparisons with all previous Maiden efforts...I dunno.  It's all very subjective obviously.  I think this may be one of their best overall.  I know I am enjoying more than BNW.    I can't believe I almost let this one slip away, but better late than never.  If you are in the same boat as I was, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  If I was stuck on an island and could only listen to one band for the rest of my life, hands down I'm taking Iron Maiden with me...
B00004XOWM|1.0|Has it really come to this? So-called \\"rock bands\\" are actually reasoning that instead of catchy melodies, hard-edged riffs, original song arrangements, emotional singing and screaming and infectious guitar solos, they'd rather try to fit as many \\"f\\" words into their lyrics as coherence will allow on top of a distorted, mid-tempo beat? This album really does epitomise everything that music should not be. All that this really is is some guy in a red baseball cap moaning about how life sucks in order to appeal to a shallow teenage market with some guitars in the background so that he can claim it's rock music. Avoid at all costs.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I want more Firefly episodes!  I just finished watching the entire series, and am saddened that there are no more.  This is simply some of the best story telling and character development I have ever seen -- it's amazing what was done in a short span of 14 episodes.  Now I am so frustrated that I will never know some of the secrets kept by the crew of nine.   <br /> <br />FOX Television -- you idiots!!!! <br /> <br />---
B00005JLKB|5.0|The season that started all. This is a great TV series to see.  Prepare to watch the human side of the man of steel, his fears, his doubts, his love. Each episode will show Clark's adventures, but also how he manage to understand his new powers and to deal with a normal life. This season is full of emotions for example what i really enjoy is how Clark and Lex (future rivals in life) met and become good friends and also every time Clark try to get close to Lana and get nervous, is really to laugh.      <br /> <br />I recommend this season if you want to know better the origins of the man of steel. If you already are an Smallville fan this season must be in your collection, if you aren't, sure you will become one after see it.
B000000H7I|5.0|Ahhh yes, the brutal & technical 1st album from the great Suffocation. This is one of my fav. death metal albums, its totally downright brutal, very technical, & was very inventive in its time when it 1st came out. Mike Smith is one of the best & fastest death drummers out there today, right up there with Flo of Cryptopsy, Paul M. of Cannibal Corpse, & Pete Sandoval of Morbid Angel. Brutal, brutal stuff here... if you dont like death metal, U wont like this CD... & by the way... to all those losers who listen to NuMetal CRAP & rap, U shouldnt come on here & talk crap about death metal just because U dont listen to it. I read this review the other day, where this kid said that death metal sucks & people should listen to real metal like Korn & Limp Bizkit. Huh... Nimrod! And still another who said that all forms of metal suck & that rap was the only kind of music people should listen to. If U wanna get down to it, it takes much more talent & time to play brutal fast technical death metal than it does to get a casio keyboard & a beat machine & rap over it about the same thing over & over in every song & every CD they make... \\"yo yo I got my blunts & my hos, I got a nine milla & I eat jelly joes...\\" man, thats some real great talent there. And NuMetal? Dont even get me started! Korn & Limp-d@#k Bizkit are NOT METAL!!!!! Kid, get that through your thick skull & quit talking crap about death metal.
B000BTJCRM|5.0|As a teenager (and musician) who lives for classic rock and thinks rap is a waste of time, I'm always looking out for a new band that will behold the voice of my generation. <br /> <br />Many recent groups have attempted this sort of importance, only leaving their audience to discover, in time, that their music is watered-down, too parodical or mimicking, or just lacking the straight-ahead rock n' roll force of the music of past generations (with the exception of, possibly, the White Stripes and only a few chosen others). Although my love for the Stones is unmatched, we need something new, something for us. Wolfmother is the missing link. They don't sound like Zeppelin or Bad Company or anyone else you've heard, but the attitude they bring is very close.  Frighteningly close. They hit the nail of a generation of subconsciously frustrated teens looking for a voice right on the head. <br /> <br />I'd like to say that if you like the howling voice, towering guitar work, and flawless rhythm section of many '70s bands, you'll like Wolfmother. But if you like rock, if you like music, listen to Wolfmother. <br /> <br />Let the album speak for itself. <br /> <br />
B000003C5C|5.0|This is my fav. Death album. The 1st one I got was \\"Human,\\" which I liked, & then I picked up the classic 1st \\"Scream Bloody Gore,\\" which I liked even better cause it had more of a trashy/old school death metal feel, ala Slayer's classic \\"Reign in Blood.\\" But then I got my hands on this brutal masterpeice... its even better than the 1st! Lyrically & musically, this album is a step above the 1st one. My personal favs. on this are... wait... I LOVE EVERY SONG ON HERE!!! I'd probably have to say that \\"Open Casket\\" is my fav though. This also showcases Chucks earlier talent, which trust me, only grew & got better with each album. He was one of the greatest guitarists in history, not juist in metal, but in the history of music. Get this album, I totally recommend it! Yeeeaaahhh!!!!!!!!! R.I.P. Chuck, U will be missed forever...

Virtually all of the performances are inspired, and it is obvious how much fun the musicians had (except, of course, for \\"Sine-Aid/Sinbad/Uncle Fester\\" O'Connor).

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's classic novel about Southern injustice during the 1930's provides a memorable read.  The story is told through the nostalgic eyes of Scout Finch, who describes her days as a young school girl living with her brother Jem and father Atticus Finch, a widowed attorney and very humane and courageous man.  Scout is a combination of still-innocent school girl and analytical thinker, and as she is puzzled by the cruelties and irrational feelings of certain adults.  The story centers on several themes, the most notable of which is Tom Robinson's trial.  Robinson is a black laborer falsely accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is appointed his public defender, and during the course of the trial Robinson's innocence becomes obvious to Scout and Jem (and to the reader).  But will evidence clearing a black man be enough to persuade the all-white jury in Alabama during the segregation era?   <br /> <br />This moving narrative was made into an equally good 1962 movie starring Gregory Peck and Mary Badham. The book and movie both arrived as the Southern establishment was still opposing racial fairness.  Some complain that this book is largely irrelevant given the realities of today's ghettos, but it remains a moving read. <br />
B000001ESP|5.0|This album is the one that won me over to Rush in the 1980s with \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\". Aside from Fly By Night, this album ranks as one of my favorites in my C.D. collection and is definitely a must have for rock fans of any generation. Even though I had a C.D. player, I had very few C.D.'s in my collection. But I recently decided to add up some and I immediately began to stock up on Rush's albums. Don't get me wrong, I have almost all of their albums now and plan on seeing them in concert next time they tour. However, this CD is one of my one of my favorites next to \\"Fly By Night\\", \\"Signals\\",  and \\"Permanent Waves\\". While I personally prefer the progressive rock sound of this and the other albums that Rush did with it, you will not be disappointed by any of the Canadian Power Trio's CDs in general since, overall, their albums have songs that every rock fan can appreciate.
B000000M4M|5.0|This CD has no less impact than when it came out eighteen years ago.  As Byron Coley says on the band's website, it shows their sound becoming more orderly as they were ready to burst at the seams from internal strife.  Well, sad but true, but tension often makes for the best music of a band's career, and J didn't live up to the manic glory here ever again.  (Now this line-up is reunited!  Get to see them for the first time with Lou on bass next month.  HO-LY CRRRRRAAAP!!!).<br /><br />So many highlights, where do you start?  I think Kurt really learned the soft/hard dynamic from J, and in many ways J's use of it sounds more fresh (likely because a trillion J wanna-be's failed to ever pop up--only a score, Kurt being one of them).  The album starts with this in somewhat famous fashion on \\"Freak Scene,\\" where there's a major chord strumming pattern that is mildly distorted.  Within in a minute, the low E power chord is thrashed so hard that the piece resembles a form of proto-death metal.  The middle part is really pretty . . . and then back to the death metal.  A lot of the songs feature this dynamic & it really never gets boring.  If you have the right tools, use them to make as many creations as possible.  I think my favorite use of this dynamic is in \\"Pond Song.\\"  It starts out with a delicate picking pattern: \\"Long distance left you undecided/ I'd sprinkle enough to let you know,\\" J pathetically croons to the girlfriend he never finds.  Before you know it, the song is awash in fuzz, reverb, and thrashing chords.  This pattern happens to match J's attitude towards his love interest, which alternates between tender yearning and murderous disenchantment, best reflected in \\"Freak Scene\\": \\"Sometimes I don't thrill you/ Sometimes I think I'll kill you./  Just don't let me f**k up will you,/ 'Cos when I need a friend it's still you.\\"<br /><br />There's so much more to say about this classic, but I will leave it at the guitars for now.  Simply put, the interplay between J on guitar and Lou on bass remains a high watermark for alternative.  Sometimes muddy, but always evocative of new and fresh emotions, there have been few power trios who have got as much out of their guitars (Rush comes to mind, tho' I know the hipster \\"cognoscenti\\" would poo-poo me for saying this).  Lou ups the ante with his use of chords and arpeggios on the bass for one thing.  J himself is certainly one of the top guitarists in the history of alternative.  He's not a harmonic genius in the technical sense: more in the intuitive sense.  His use of feedback is heartbreakingly beautiful at times (the solo in \\"No Bones\\" amply evidences this).  He uses dissonance strategically, creating hooks out of repeating skronky lines after a particularly melodic run (again, the second solo in \\"Freak Scene\\" is great for this).  He shreds the thing like he's, well, ready to break it in two.  Oh yeah, and it's LOUD.  I saw them live (without Lou) back in the early '90's.  He would play solos and my head literally felt like it was being cleft at the lobes.  It hurt!!!  But it was the true definition of sublimity: intense pleasure mixed with intense pain.  Can't wait to feel the pain for the first time with Lou helping me smash my head on the punk rock.<br /><br />Last contrast: I played this to my girlfriend for the first time today.  She liked it a lot.  Of all the grunge bands in the '90's, this was a good one for the women, 'cos J writes more traditional melodies and also wears his heart on his sleeve, unlike, say, the phrygian modes and D&D bludgeonings of Soundgarden.  Male/female, yin/yang, silence/noise, love/hate, within/beyond . . . _Bug_ has more than enough contrasts to keep you occupied for a long, long time to come.  Check them out live if they are coming to your area.ween J on guitar and Lou on bass remains a high watermark for alternative.

B000BTJDGC|5.0|<br />This one gave me that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.  A powerful theme drives this movie, and I would argue that that theme isn't so much possession, as it is belief.   <br /> <br />The movie walks the line between possibility and likelyhood, allowing its audience to form its own verdict over the case of Emily Rose.  Was she merely sick or was she possessed by demons?  Was she misguided by her religious beliefs or was she a martyr for her faith? <br /> <br />Or was she both?  Could she have believed so strongly in her own affliction that her psychosis ran away with it, even developed it into these manifestations of demons that spoke through her?  And even if that's the case, was she not still a martyr for her faith?  Did she not still die for her beliefs...did she not still deliver the message of good and evil to the people, and in that way bring more to the faith?   <br /> <br />There's room enough in this film to doubt my conclusion.  Watch it and come to your own.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Boy, the Strokes' legacy outran them fast. Their debut Is This It has been tossed into the \\"Museum Piece or Transcendent Art?\\" vat sooner after its release than any other album in my lifetime. Which category it falls under isn't so much the issue - even bona fide \\"classics\\" have elements of both the dated and the immortal - rather how the sledgehammer that was their cultural influence was so instantaneous and pervasive that only a few years after they appeared somethingawful misanthropist \\"Dr.\\" David Thorpe would declare them the year's \\"band that sounds most like a Karaoke version of itself.\\" Say what you will about how you hear Is This It now, but the fact is they are probably the most influential revivalist group of this decade and at this point anything they put out will inevitably feel disquieting and a little banal. Ever hear people talk about how Brian Wilson's Smile would be hailed as the greatest album ever if only it had come out in the 1960s as originally planned? Gives me the chills. The point is that people take everything the Strokes did for granted, and therefore even if First Impressions of Earth ended up being an improved version of Is This It, the album would set off subconscious \\"anachronism alarms.\\"  <br /> <br />That I and many others are not interested in evaluating the potential \\"influence\\" of albums could have worked to the Strokes' advantage this time around. Their sophomore release Room on Fire was a genuinely strong followup that, despite showing only a little sound expansion in two culture-crammed years, seemed to verify the uniformity of their songwriting prowess. Critics who liked it significantly less than Is This It, I'll just come out and say it, were not rising above petty societal tidal waves and ripples as they should have been. The exact same critical flaw led to the hyperbole of the band's debut. Contrary to (still, amazingly) popular belief, it wasn't the Strokes' music that provoked love-it-or-hate-it sentiments, it was the idea of the Strokes, the prospect of what the album would do to indie rock in forthcoming years. And glossy magazines like the New Musical Express were right, to be sure. I don't know if we can directly attribute the existence of the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party and Interpol (naming the most well known) to that of the Strokes, but such various offshoots of minimalist punk and new wave certainly became old hat within a year or two, and still they come. It's nonsensical that some publications could still insist that it was the album itself that polarized the music community; what reasonable person wasn't grabbed by the cyclic, melodic garage of Is This It, yet what intelligent person could help letting the album title's infamous (and overgagged) three words pass through his mind? I picked up First Impressions of Earth because I assumed negative reactions were just an extension of the antagonism with which Room on Fire was met, but frankly this album doesn't just suffer from being out of place. Yes, it establishes some well-earned ambiguity about the future of the group. Still, I can't imagine even diehard Strokes fans calling it a successful album.  <br /> <br />First and foremost, take a good look at the length of the album. Fourteen tracks and over fifty minutes is an ambitious temporal step for a band that had formerly recorded about seventy minutes' worth of songs. If it sounds like a selling point, \\"bang for your buck\\" or whatnot, think again. The album basically starts out promising with a handful of solid tracks and proceeds to taper off over the whole damn stretch, with occasional blips of interest. Anyone who has inadvertently memorized their first two albums and can sing along without thinking knows that the Strokes are best at making morsels of glee: delectable and over before you know it. If anything, First Impressions is the opposite. Even the catchy tunes - which are there, don't get me wrong - have an uncomfortable, burdensome feel. Just an hour after I was telling a friend that the vocal part of \\"Juicebox\\" seemed a bit slapped together, I had it running through my head. Such is the case with several of the songs. More than ever it's the prevailing attitude that sticks with the listener after the album ends, so it's really a question of specific mood preferences. The now-sober Julian Casablancas continues his trajectory into, how to put this delicately, caring about his life more. On Is This It his lyrics conveyed swollen-headed boredom (\\"I turned `round/`Baby, don't care no more/I know this for sure/I'm walking out that door\\") but on Room on Fire he showed a little more desperation in his indifference, insisting that he \\"Never needed anybody/I never needed nobody.\\" First Impressions completes the transition from apathetic to pathetic with tearjerkers like \\"I've got nothing to say/I've got nothing to give/I've got nothing to say/got no reason to live.\\" The lyrics are only occasionally obtrusive enough to be irritating, but when Casablancas tries his drawl at emotional, stretched out tunes he is inescapably out of its element.  <br /> <br />Some have said that such uneasy facets are not for wont of hooks as much as the Strokes' attempts to broaden their horizons. Maybe so, but if Casablancas really was anything like Lou Reed (a common perception I've often disputed) he'd have broad songwriting skills that apply to a variety of genres. After all, we don't pretend every stylistically inert band that borrowed from one aspect of the Velvet Underground is actually reviving them. This album demonstrates awkward, almost adolescent musical growth, the slight exploration and reach of which simply highlight their own self-induced limitations. The interspersed musical techniques tremble but don't squirm, and thus the album lacks the edge that their earlier work achieved by defiantly orchestrating every song near-identically. The backing musicians do their best to enhance the more mediocre songs with crisply executed solos and fills, but even the songs that step outside the Strokes' comfort zone have such narrow individual boundaries that such diddles seem forced instead of natural. Not that the Strokes can't recognize their own successes and failures; in the handful of layered variations within each song they hit you with the classiest first and defer the discomfited. Accordingly, if you aren't satisfied at the beginning you probably won't be for the next three minutes. It's a little upsetting that comparative ambition could lead to so many more dead ends, but Casablancas is just that much more aware of and concerned for his audience than Lou Reed, which is ultimately why he can never be as defiant as he might like.  <br /> <br />Alright, I downplay the significance of the gems for the sake of argument. A handful of songs are as worthy as any on their previous albums. Like I said, I'm just a little bemused about using a bigger box to send fewer items. Inconsistency isn't really being discouraged nowadays, and thus First Impressions of Earth is a typically unnecessary \\"album\\" in the age of the iPod. Indifferent about 2/3rds of the songs? Delete them. Many fans will be fine with this. Now, I can't purport that their first two were real album lover's albums, but they were certainly gapless and thus ran through so smoothly that it would be a crime to chop them up. Meanwhile, this album is unfulfillingly devoid of euphoric little anthems, and as an advocate of the album format I can recognize it as an unsteady step in an unknown direction - perhaps towards a whole new identity - but not the delightful little safety net that I hoped they'd churn out.  <br /> <br />B-
0307276902|1.0|My agent sent me this book when it first came out. I read 20 pages and put it down in disgust. Frey's story is a disgrace to those addicts who've died fighting the battle. As a recovering heroin addict, 19 years, I lost 15 of my friends to the battle and James Frey's lies-- shame every single one of them. Even his recent letter is just more spin. If he truly cared about those poor souls who are struggling to free themselves of addiction-he'd immediately remove the book from print or demand the publisher call it fiction. I tell you why he will not-money! In 1996, I won the du-Pont Columbia for excellence in broadcast journalism for a HBO documentary called, \\"High on Crack Street: Lost lives in Lowell. I'm so angry about James Frey's lies I've decided to write the TRUE story of addiction in honor of those people James Frey has disgraced.
0679422714|1.0|The author tried to portray Mao as a blood thirsty, ruthless, despot with no redeeming quality but fail to take into consideration that Mao was a central committee member of the KMT (an almost unknown historical fact). If Mao is only an opportunist, he would have stick with the KMT. In the early years, when Mao was in the CCP, he was never Moscow's choice in its leadership. In fact his doctrine of organizing peasants in the country side was totally against the communist model of workers uprising in the cities. It was only after the total failure of the uprising in the cities that Mao came into the leadership position in the CCP. The book also failed to point out that before 1945 the USSR has always supported KMT financially and military in a ratio of 10 to 1 to the detriment of the CCP. This fact was conveniently neglected in the book.    I have tried to research the great famine of 1957-59 but unable to found any conclusive evidence to come to any realistic figure. This book simply guessed that 60-70 million died. If 30 million deaths occurred during the eight year Sino-Japanese war were China's population actually decreased, would it be possible for China's population to almost double from 1949 until 1977 with 70 million unnatural deaths. There is no denying that famine did occur but the number stated is simply sloppy guesswork.     There are many books that would make you dumb and this is one of them. This book would also make you ignorant of the real China in the 20th century because it is simply too dishonest in interpreting and twisting \\"interviews\\", \\"facts\\" and \\"archives\\". It is however very useful to lure gullible people into buying the authors point of view. You would do yourself a great disservice if you do not research this subject further.     Mao is a very complex historical figure. If you bothered doing research by reading all the academics books published by renowned universities, you still won't understand him. The purpose of this book is simply to get to this conclusion: Communism = evil, Mao = evil. If you got to this conclusion, you had been had. His story is much more complex than this.    An outstanding must read for those guilt ridden Europeans who need to find an Asian monster comparable to the legions of imperialists who conquered, massacred and enslaved hundreds of millions throughout the past five centuries. It is like saying that the US of A is founded on ethnic cleansing of the natives, built on the labor of kidnapped slaves etc and is nothing but an evil empire that still oppressed its minorities and poor. Is this the story of the United States of America?
055371452X|5.0|Once again I just love these recordings.  More characters come to life, Brianna and Roger.  The music takes you to King Louis court, you can almost smell the roses.  I just wish the story could be read word for word, how many tapes would that be?  I suggest you read the book first and your appreciation of the audio version will be greatly enhanced.  If you do listen to the recording first I believe it will encourage you to go back and read the book for the parts that were edited out of the recording.  It does help to read the books in order, but you can get the jist of the meaning individually.  I love the books and the audio tapes and cannot wait for the next book in the series.
0783240236|5.0|I remember as a child in the late 1960's watching this Alfred Hitchcock masterwork in the darkened family room and being terrified awaiting the next bird attack. It was great, and to my pleasure, it still is. Now that I am far more familiar with Hitchcock's filmography and realize the gamut of sophisticated drama and thrilling suspense he created in his long career, I think 1963's \\"The Birds\\" is far and away the most wonderfully visceral experience he produced onscreen. The film is one part allegory on man's impudence over nature and one part family psychodrama full of unresolved feelings, and the two parts work seamlessly together thanks to Evan Hunter's shrewd screenplay. Hitchcock recognizes that more than the technical effects he amassed to simulate the surreal, bludgeoning bird attacks, the actual storytelling is what drives the plot.<br /><br />Although the birds provide an ominous presence from the outset, it starts with a flirtatious, love-hate romance between spoiled socialite Melanie Daniels and insolent attorney Mitch Brenner.  Seeking but failing to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his little sister Cathy, Mitch travels to his family home in the friendly hamlet of Bodega Bay north of San Francisco. Motivated by her attraction to Mitch, Melanie goes up to deliver the lovebirds to his home, but oddly, a seagull attacks her as she pilots a boat on the bay. This is the start of what becomes a series of attacks that increase in scope and terror, and what I appreciate about Hitchcock's style is how he manages to build to them gradually, almost nonchalantly until the moment of strike when he lets the birds take over the screen. Equally intriguing is the way the characters are presented, especially Mitch's subtly dysfunctional family, and how each reacts to the attacks.<br /><br />In a surprising twist, Hitchcock eschews the glamorous stars he usually casts for the leads, though ironically the journeyman-level contributions of Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor seem to work in the film's favor as they don't distract from the allegorical storyline. Taking over for Grace Kelly, Hedren manages to exude the sophistication if not quite the complexity of Melanie. As Mitch, Taylor has always been a lunkish presence onscreen and barely charismatic enough to elicit such fervent behavior from the women around him, but he manages the heroic sincerity necessary in the role. Far better are Jessica Tandy, who sublimates her natural likeability to play Mitch's controlling, needy mother Lydia, and a sonorous Suzanne Pleshette as repressed schoolteacher Annie who still longs for Mitch from a distance. I also love Ethel Griffies's bit as the elderly ornithologist who happens to be there to explain the genesis of the various bird species.<br /><br />Even though the matte shots look dated compared to today's seamless computer animation, the effects are still startling, and some scenes are developed brilliantly, in particular, the schoolyard accumulation leading to a direct attack on the running children. There are quirks that are a bit frustrating for their artificiality - heavy use of back-screen projection, the predictable behavior of stereotypical town folk - but none of this detracts from the superb craftsmanship and breathless pacing toward the apocalyptic ending. There are several extras included with the DVD, the best being the looking-back documentary, \\"All About The Birds\\". This represents grand execution by a true master.m's favor as they don't distract from the allegorical storyline.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION begins almost exactly where UNDERWORLD ended. The movie fills in part of the story so those unfamiliar with the first film won't be left behind. As much as UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a sequel, it's also a story of origins. In this movie, the audience is told where the first vampires and lycans came from. Apparently, there was one immortal who had two sons. One son became the father of the vampires (Markus) and the other the father of the lycans. However, the lycan (William) was unstable and his father and brother were forced to hunt the creature down, capture it, and kill those who had turned. Thus the long war between the vampires and the lycans began almost from the beginning.<br /><br />With this lesson of origins told, the movie races back to the present day where we find Michael and Selene on the run. Markus is awakened from his sleep and doesn't like what Selene has done. He's been planning all along that once he was awaken that he would find his brother and forge a new vampire/lycan alliance.<br /><br />UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a decent sequel. There is an unnecessary sex scene and most of the fighting is on a one-on-one basis instead of army versus army. Nevertheless, the film is pretty much action packed from the beginning and except for the moments to fill in some &#34;history&#34; the movie doesn't slow down. I'm not sure if the studio is planning on making UNDERWORLD into a trilogy. If so, since the 2nd part of a trilogy usually deals with origins, UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a worthy sophomoric episode.
B00004T0UT|5.0|For many, during the 1960s, Elvis Presley, after having gotten out of the Army, was MIA (Missing In Action)--submerging himself in some of the most godawful musical comedy movies ever made, with only a few of the songs (\\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\"; \\"Viva Las Vegas\\"; \\"Kissin' Cousins\\") reaching the level of what he had done in his late 1950s prime.  So much had changed in the world during the Sixties, while the Colonel put his client through a terrible routine that destroyed the man's considerable acting potential and nearly ran his music career into the ground.  But the monstrous success of 1968 NBC-TV comeback special gave The King a whole new lease on life. <br /> <br />And with this album, FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS, the man that generations had grown up with and whose 60s decline they lamented was back in full force.  Elvis found himself recording material that he could invest everything he had into, and the results were spectacular.  FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS encapsulates everything the man and American popular music were all about--R&B, pop, country, blues, the whole nine yards.  Whether it's covers of \\"Only The Strong Survive\\" and \\"Gentle On My Mind\\", or fresh new songs like \\"Wearin' That Loved On Look\\", every bit of Elvis is in these songs.  And it doesn't hurt in the slightest to have no fewer than four Top 40 hits on here either--\\"In The Ghetto\\" (#3); \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\" (#6); \\"Kentucky Rain\\" (#16); and the ever-popular \\"Suspicious Minds\\" (sadly, the King's last #1 hit), all true classics in his repertoire.  Finally, one song of particular note is \\"Long Black Limousine\\", which has an almost disturbing and chilling resonance to it. <br /> <br />The album's #13 posting on the Billboard Top 200 during the summer of 1969, coming off the #8 charting of the comeback special album, was a remarkable feat, given how turbulent pop music was back then, and it showed Elvis still had the goods when he trumped his manager's fast greasy buck approach.  It is a tragedy, of course,that Elvis was never totally able to escape the Colonel's pull because that, along with the terrible abuse he did to his body, was what led to his early demise.  But when the King was at his best, as he certainly was here and would be more than half the time in his final eight years of life, he was untouchable.  He was, to put it delicately, extraordinary, and this great 1969 album, arguably the finest of his career, is solid proof.
B000B0QJM2|1.0|I agree with R.KEEFE.I thought it would be the concert,one of the best concerts I had ever listened.60 minutes of mono music with the comment of some critics,like we needed such comments. <br />This DVD is so stupid.Wish I hadn't been fooled by the title.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This is a classic album that sounds as honest and sincere now as it did way back in 1971.

B000CBSHK2|5.0|Looking at some of the reviews of this album I am struck by the idea that it is supposed to sound one way or another. There is good music and there is bad music, lets be thankful when something good comes along.   <br />With all the crap that the so called music industry punches out today, it is refreshing to hear a clean, simple and original production.   <br />I would like to compare this work with something as a reference point, but the comparisons seem trite.  These songs will endure and always give the listener a sense of comfort, joy, sadness, humor and introspection.  <br />This feels like the music that Beth Orton has had in her all along! <br />We are so lucky that these songs snuck through the industry dragnet of mediocrity.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This movie is really the definitive dark comedy, there is nothing particulary funny about nukes or war for that matter, but this film does indeed make you laugh. Peter Sellers was one of the best comedic talents who ever lived. Dr. Strangelove displays his talents in one film just as well as the entire Pink Panther series did. Stanley Kubrick was a great director and this movie is one of his finest works. Highly recommended movie.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|This movie did nothing for me, it was incredibly corny, and I felt that the writers were whingeing just to hear themselves whinge!  <br />I'm giving this movie two stars for the songs, which even though they were childish, still made this otherwise mundane movie bearable.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Finally a musicale come along where the whole nation is talking about it and going to see it. It's rare that a musicale is a box office hit and musicales have been declared long dead but can Chicago bring it back from the dead. The film went on to win best picture and it deserved it. The film is excelent and at times beyond great that makes this an excellent picture. The acting is great from all stars and the musicale numbers are beyond excellnet. The film is raw and is full of every thing a movie should be. One of the years best films.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I saw the movie with my sister when it first came out. It is the most seductive movie for all your senses - so much so that if you don't have chocolate while your watching it, you'll feel deprived. The story and scenery is alluring with superb acting from all the cast and the music is delightful with variations of each piece. Watch it curled up on the lounge with your favourite chocolates to share with your favourite person!
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Dinsey needs to come up with better films like Beuty and the beast, Aladian, Lion King becouse in the direction it's going it's going down hill. I have to say the movie did not suck and it was not bad but it wasent really good. The movie aims more at he young audience which movies cant really do now becouse adults enjoy animated films more then kids for example Shrek 1 and 2, Incrediables, Finding Nemo and more too name. The film's story is ok it's like the classic story but thsi time it shows what happend next. The animation is cute and the whole time you watch it your thinking ah cute or the animation is good but what's the story. There is not much of a story to this film and it's very short as soon as I got into it it was over. Overall it's an enjoyable film for kids but adults may get board with it but it's fun to watch for the animation and the odd funny moments.
B0000DJZ9T|3.0|Coldplay is my favorite band and I've seen them live 2 times recently. I just recently rewatched this dvd and could barely get thru it. As has been previously stated by other reviewers, its like watching a 90 minute music video. Most of the concert is in black and white. Most of the camera shots are out of focus, very close up and not focused on anything for more than 2-3 seconds. In the beginning of Politik, when the guitars and drums are heavy, it looks like the camera is vomiting. Its pretty much unwatchable. Its like watching a strobelight with a different image every second.  Hopefully if Coldplay decided to release another concert dvd (and i hope they do) they can get the director of U2's Vertigo tour dvd to produce it.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|One of the best golden age disney film is finally released in the platnium edition dvd series. The dvd it self is great the colour is better then ever and there are plenty of bonus features including making of, deleted scene and much more. The stry is great and very cute for young and old. The songs are even good liie the cat song and he's a tramp song. The animation is also very good. Some disney films you watch now are not as good as when they where relesed but this one iss till great and will be watced over and over again.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I've been a RentHead since I first saw the show in 1997. I think the movie was very well done, and I just purchased the 2 disc special edition. There is a documentary about Jonathan Larson on the bonus disc called No Day But Today that is just amazing. It tells Jonathans story of how he began, all of his other projects, and all he went through just to get Rent to the stage. Its full of commentary from his friends, family, and the original cast. It takes you all the way through his tragic death on opening night, right up to the making of the motion picture. If you are a true fan of Rent you will love it. The documentary made me cry about 4 or 5 times.

Now everyone in the know knows that Nutter though deceased for over three centuries was a very accurate forecaster, just ask the villagers she burned who reside in Hell.  The omens to the final countdown are everywhere.  The Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are on the road; Atlantis rises, frogs die; rage is the norm as fights break out between loved ones.  The armies of God and those of the Antichrist prepare for the final war between Heaven and hell, battlefield earth.<br /><br />However, Aziraphale the angel and Crowley the demon like their present lifestyles, amiable with each other rather than their distant employers who neither has seen in eons, and would prefer delaying the Rapture for eternity.  To halt Armageddon, Crowley and Aziraphale team up knowing that only one thing can do so, murder the Antichrist.  However, first they need to find him as he has been placed in the wrong household, but neither know who his parents are or for that matter who he is.  There hope to locate the kid resides in Agnes Nutter, an allegedly dead witch.<br /><br />This is a reprint of an amusing wild satire that the religiously intolerant will claim the two authors and those like this reviewer who enjoyed the tale will be left behind.  The story line is fast-paced and action-packed while skewing organized religion with its good vs. evil rigid doctrine leading to war against infidels in the name of God on earth.  GOOD OMENS is a great satirical thriller that makes a delightful mockery of those who \\"evilly\\" use religion as a shield to foster hate and murder in the name of God for one does not need 666 to commit atrocities on earth.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00000JCOV|1.0|Slipknot's art is the music of high energy automotive crashes and would best be utilized as backround noise to a hacking murder.  This \\"music\\" helps explain the descent of society into it's most primitive and barbaric roots. The message of perversion and surrender will justify any teenagers decision to blow off personal responsibility and to abandon their future. <br /> <br />This CD is best played on HIGH, in the Microwave, for 15 to 20 seconds.  Every parent should make sure this happens.
B00005JOFO|4.0|I really was moved by Brokeback Mountain. It is a sad and often touching film, that should be seen at least once by anyone interested in cinema. The direction by Ang Lee is flawless in almost every frame.     I was angered by the film for not giving a clear explaination for one of the character's death. I now feel differently. It is best for the viewer to think what they want about it. It was the death itself and how it affected the other characters that was important in the film. The death itself will affect the viewer, and Del Mar's reaction to it is heartbreaking.     Some reviews mention the makeup, cloths and other superficial aspects of the film. They are not important to enjoying the film.  The acting, direction and story are why the film should be seen and even studied.     A student will find writing a thesis on the story, the film or book a great challenge. There are things in the film, subtle things, that get missed during one viewing. If you want to know what I am talking about, see the film again. Look closly at every scene; take it all in. I have not yet read the book.      Brokeback Mountain is a wonderfully sad and disturbing film. It may have it's amusing moments, they are few. This film is about love, lust and life. Live's without committment, where lies do more damage than aweful truths.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Glorious, taut production. Splendid from beginning to end.  <br />Perfect casting - right down to the extras' briefly glimpsed faces. <br />Remarkable direction. <br />Haunting imagery. <br />Achingly beautiful score. <br />Simply, buy it and ENJOY...
B000002J09|5.0|I am a person who listens to heavy music, black metal, death the whole works.  I gotta say- a classic is a classic.  Led zeppelin is just magical in this cd, jimmy page- \\"stair way to heaven\\"- one of the tops and best solo playing ever to be recorded, an excellent band.  Im a fan of lyrics and good songwriting, and these guys put on one of the best i have ever read, that song \\"SWTH\\" i mentioned earlier really makes you think.  goes nice with the folk tunes it carries...god what a cd- i enjoy it....im like the only one outa all my buddies who likes the old stuff...pink floyd, jimmi, etc...and yes of course the all time favorite, and mine......LED ZEPPELIN!!!!!!!!!
B00005K9LN|3.0|I've got to weigh in on this one. Someone mentioned (2 people, actually) Rob's more \\"tough guy\\" vocals, do you mean, um... \\"rough guy\\" vocals, perhaps? First Freddie, then Rob... ugh. Not to be a spoiler or anything to all you who've jumped the fence, watch out that you actually clear the thing and don't get your family jewels smashed. (I hope you don't understand what that's all about, but if you do, and didn't know, what a shame, eh?) But it's REALLY all about the music, right? So, let's get to... <br />I was a giant fan of \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" and \\"Unleashed...\\" (To wit: \\"...never turn your back on the ripper!\\" Indeed. Further, I could name a dozen JP songs with similar sentiments, but I digress. However, I must say, I am not an \\"unabashed\\" Priest fan any longer, it just don't seem right somehow, nor am I a big Pete Townshend fan, either, or William S. Burroughs, who was the first to use the \\"rough boys\\" terminology, as far as I know, he ruined a lot of great prose with some sick twisted stuff, but I digress further...) Anyway, remember the days when good, clean (dirty, in reality) rock and roll meant \\"wine, WOMEN, and song\\"? Those days are long gone... I just can't express how much Rob ruined it for me.  <br />Anyway, the CD is dated, yes, but DOES contain some great songs and has a great overall vibe to it. Some of Priest's earlier stuff suffered from poor recording and/or mixing and/or production, \\"Sin After Sin\\" comes to mind, and although \\"Stained Class\\" was better, \\"Hell Bent\\" is where they really started to shine overall production wise. Given all that, if I had to grab 3 Priest CDs off the top of my head (I don't usually keep them there, but anyway...) I'd probably choose \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\", \\"Unleashed In The East\\" and \\"British Steel\\" because I think these are the 3 most instantly memorable CDs and the first two are probably Priest's best, and \\"British Steel\\" does have a lot of catchy \\"heavy metal\\" (I don't like '80s \\"heavy metal\\" at all by the way, at least until you get to G 'N' R, don't know if they're considered heavy metal or good ol' rock and roll, and I thought Metallica's [Lars has sure ruined a good thing, selfish, 'e is] \\"And Justice For All\\" is pretty decent) tunes on it, some good, upbeat stuff, some more \\"serious\\" rocking stuff and I kinda get a kick out of \\"United\\", but I wonder (nowadays) what that meant to Rob at the time he wrote it! I'd give it a 3.5, but I'm going to round down, since I think overall that there were many other hard rock bands who were more succesful at about the same time period (mid-to-late '70s UFO and Scorpions, and early-to-mid '70s Black Sabbath, to name three), mostly because they had the rock AND roll (as Keith Richards would say), instead of just the heavy grind (though \\"Hell Bent\\" had a good spirit to it). What did Rob mean by \\"Delivering The Goods\\"? Eeuuwww, nevermind, just listen to the music... three stars. \\"Unleashed In The East\\" was their pinnacle, as \\"Strangers In The Night\\" was for UFO and \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" for Scorpions. As Ozzie would say, \\"Halford wears boots, you gotta believe me...!\\"  \\"Stained Class\\", a good name for the band's bio. I gotta give it to Rob, though (What? Did I just say that? Outrageous!), he had a great set of vocal cords. Wonder what he gargled with before going onstage? The abuse, the punishment, that throat must have endured... So not only has the Roman Catholic clergy redifined the meaning of \\"priest\\" (as in \\"Watch out for the priest!\\"), so has Rob Halford! I knew there was a religious tie-in there somewhere, and you thought it was all about \\"the Devil\\". Are you sure? (Better be...) 'Nuf said (more, then [sic] enough).
B000E8QVWY|2.0|no, no, no.  i just can't get past joquain's portrayal of CASH.  his voice just doesn't cut it, and the musical numbers are painful to watch.  if CASH actually sounded like that, he never would have been popular.  i think the ball was dropped by the casting of this movie...i am positive that there are better fits for CASH out there than phoenix.  when you're dealing with such a legend, it behooves you to make the right choice.  i guess i'm just too big of a CASH fan, of course i understand that no one can ever be CASH but i just feel that this movie would have been better with different lead actors (yes, reese is cute but she ain't no june neither!)  plus, the movie paints a very shallow picture of CASH as a pill popping freak.  one more thing...phoenix's acting is pretty terrible as well.  he looks like a monkey when he tries to mimic CASH's facial expressions.  go back and watch some vintage CASH footage, you'll see what i mean.  way overacted.  this movie is wayyyyyyyyy overrated!
B00005JOWF|5.0|...and for those of you who think that it is too unrealistic, MOVIES don't have to be real.  They are for entertainment, and for people who have a good imagination. If you don't like the CG work, then go and do better.  It was a great movie, there was a theater full of people clapping at the end of the movie, signaling that they enjoyed it. If I had to rate it out of 100, I'd give it 101!
B0000214F0|5.0|Definitely a different type of historical drama movie, \\"Caligula\\" differentiates itself from other movies by holding nothing back in terms of sexuality.  Probably the only historical drama I've seen that consists of actual sex scenes with real bodily fluids and Roman-style orgies; some call it obscene, grotesque, etc, but those opinions go to show how utterly different the times of Ancient Rome were, and the film is unafraid to provide such a generous helping of sex that it is quite literally considered by many an expensive porno.<br /><br />The violence is not as horrible as you might see in R-rated horror movies (or that grotesque scene in Spiderman2 with Doctor Octopus butchering the surgeons), though with much blood, and one case of castration (not real, don't worry!)<br /><br />The acting is truly something else.  Malcolm McDowell puts on his best performance I've ever seen as Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus \\"Caligula\\", and even succeeds in giving Caligula a human face apart from the grotesque portrayals of all the historians who chronicled him (Tacitus and Suetonius).  He truly excels in showing a Caligula who is not necessarily completely mad, but rather an average young man corrupted by extreme wealth, extreme power, and the need to shock and disturb the aristocrats he so detests.  Don't confuse this, he IS quite mad, but he is still human, and has human emotions; love, jealousy, paranoia, fear, hatred.  Peter O'Toole's role as Tiberius is short in regard to the total movie, but it is absolutely convincing, casually trying to kill Caligula while continuing about his facade of treating him as a loved one.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the movie was when Caligula organized an entire Roman legion on the coast of Italy, said he was going to invade Britain, and had the legionnaires charge, naked, into the water and attack Papyrus plants.  I had a great laugh at that.<br /><br />Now comes the problems:  It seems to me this film has had a controversial post-production period, in which screenplay writer Gore Vidal attempted to disown the screenplay, porn director Bob Guccione added some pretty pretentious and unnecessary sex scenes which contributed nothing to the movie and brought the momentum to a stand still so we could watch some random girls have sex for some reason known only to him, and some of the scenes appear to have been cut together in the wrong places, as I've read in other reviews.<br /><br />Personally, it had potential to be absolutely spectacular, with less attention focused on the few random sex scenes, and what felt like a 45 minute sequence of just watching all the men and women (Senators' wives and daughters) having sex on that Roman naval ship in the city was exhausting.  It ceases to be arousing after about five minutes of that damn orgy, and the camera keeps going on and on and on and on for what seems like half the movie (it's much shorter than 45 minutes, but it just FELT that long)<br /><br />I consider this a classic; one of those movies you absolutely have to see, like Midnight Cowboy, or The Manchurian Candidate, or The Name of the Rose.<br /><br />Also, this is the ONLY time I have EVER even THOUGHT this, but: This movie is definitely a movie you should NEVER show to ANYONE under the age of 16.<br /><br />NEVER before have I ever thought about any movie.  But don't feel dishearted--it's not a trashy gore flick like a Tarantino movie or something.  Nor is it a trashy porn with a half-assed plot.  It's a good movie, which shows the full moral scape of Rome, from the debauched aristocratic high life in the Imperial palace, to the squalor on the streets, and Malcolm McDowell's performance is as memorable as his performance in A Clockwork Orange.  If only conservative america weren't so cruel, it could be a genuine classic...post-production period, in which screenplay writer Gore Vidal attempted to disown the screenplay, porn director Bob Guccione added some pretty pretentious and unnecessary sex scenes which contributed nothing to the movie and brought the momentum to a stand still so we could watch some random girls have sex for some reason known only to him, and some of the scenes appear to have been cut together in the wrong places, as I've read in other reviews. <br /> <br />Personally, it had potential to be absolutely spectacular, with less attention focused on the few random sex scenes, and what felt like a 45 minute sequence of just watching all the men and women (Senators' wives and daughters) having sex on that Roman naval ship in the city was exhausting.

B000C1ZXDG|4.0|What is it about this book that transforms one into a hauntingly romantic magical place like no other.  Some pages were rather tedious that I had to skip them, but still a very unique and unforgettable read. I was thinking of giving 5 stars but felt that the writer was stilted and failed to be convincing as to the depths of feeling in the two main   relationships, hence the 4 stars.
B0000025DD|4.0|Great album! Didn't give it 5 stars because a lot of the songs have many of the same familiar sounds but hey! The guitar work and vocals are consistently fabulous! Doe's have a Pink Floyd sound but gee, Guess Why! His compatriots who were once in a group with him had a fantastic opportunity to make some great bucks if you ask me! The bass and drums were well done and complimented Gilmore's work and for sure you will enjoy this artistic work!
0393327345|5.0|This book is powerful.  It is beautiful.  It is insightful and meaningful.  And, if you're squeamish, it'll make you cringe less than the movie.  It's odd because I don't like any other of Chuck Palahniuk's works, but this one is a masterpiece.  It's symbolic, it's real, it's thought-provoking, and it's absurd!  It's deep, it's heavy, it's carefree.  It's about society as a whole and about just one man.  How can one novel be all these things all at once?  Brilliant!
0689878451|5.0|It is appalling to me to know that there are sewar-filled, reprobate, sullied, paranoid minds, in which this book can be interpreted as having a cloaked \\"homosexual agenda.\\"   <br /> <br />Not since Jerry Falwell spotted \\"gay\\" Telly Tubbies on the loose has there been a more stupid accusation of a supposed threat to child development. <br /> <br />Only a sick jaundice eye would see such a \\"homosexual\\" agenda in this book.  So fearful are these vacuous little minds that they fear that thier son or daughter after reading this book will irrevocably forego traditional heterosexual marriage, turn gay and have a homosexual union and adopt a child other than their own to raise.  So threatening is this utterly absurd possibility that in some schools, the book has actually been removed from the non-fiction and childrens section. <br /> <br />So what is all the fuss about?  What is this story?  It is actually based on a true incident involving two male penguins that together took charge over an egg that they cared for until it hatched and reared the baby penguin, called Tango. <br /> <br />From a biological point of view, this incident is fascinating but not all together unqiue.  While we humans would have difficulty perhaps fully appreciating this, it is testament to how the importance of the survival of the species can have such strong instincual drives for non-related members to ensure the survival of members of their species.  But then again, this is not that unheard of even in human settings.  In many places, the \\"it takes a village to raise a child\\" is actually taken literally, where non-biological fathers will watch over and protect the offspring of other men as if their own.  The children are viewed as being members of the community and in this repect the child in question has not only a biological mother and father, but an army of non-related mothers and fathers not far behind.  This unifies the community and makes it incredibly rich in social networks and very dependable and strong--socially and especially during times of crisis.  In our modern world, such a concept might even seem disturbingly offensive in concept to parents seeing their child as only theirs and (for good reasons) not wanting their children to be so trusting of others in viwing them as proverbial \\"mommies\\" and \\"daddies.\\"  But to then fear this book for having a said \\"hidden\\" agenda of a homosexual nature is the only truly reprehensible thing. <br /> <br />This book is an endearing story and perfectly innocent for children.  It is not housing any agenda of any kind and only a diseased mind would think otherwise.   <br /> <br />As a Christian heterosexual male, I am ashamed of the all too frequent nonsense that many in the Christian community are saying and claiming.  Poor examples for Christians such as Falwell and Pat Robertson, who in their sporadic fits of self-rigtheous retardation, offer not the New Testament message of God's eternal love and peace but rather the erroneous message of the ended era of Law, namely condemnation, wrath, and destruction (such as Robertson more than implying God would soon wipe off Dover, Pennsylvania for voting in upholding separation of Church and State). <br /> <br />And even if they were \\"gay\\" Penguins and creationism is completely true, then would not have God have created (yikes) \\"gay\\" Penguins?  Hmm...   <br /> <br />No word if the two male penguins and the purse carrying Telly Tubby are mingling yet, but I am sure Rev. Falwell will keep us all appraise of the situation. <br /> <br />God bless our nation--and SAVE it from its stupidity!  AMEN.
B00003W8NM|5.0|My husband got this movie for us to watch shortly after it came out on DVD.  I did not want to watch it because I thought it would just be a bunch of violence.  However, I watched it anyway because I figured I'd give it a chance and I'd still be spending time with the hubby.  By the end of the movie, I was in tears.  To this day, my husband still makes fun of me for crying at a movie that's not supposed to be a tear-jerker.  But, I was so knocked off my feet by it.  The next week, I checked the book out of the library and read it, too.  If you have any brain cells at all, it's easy to look past the violence and fighting and read between the lines.  The commentary it makes about modern society is powerful and real.  All the visual effects, sound, etc. of the movie are awesome as well.  This is one of my favorite movies, and I'm a \\"chick.\\"  It's not one to watch if you're in the mood for something light-hearted, though.  Save it for when you're in a more philosophical state of mind.
0679422714|2.0|Jung Chang writes a compelling book on Mao, there is no doubt that extensive research was done in writing this book but she fails in the one thing that most readers would have expected from the author - OBJECTIVITY.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Mao committed heinous crimes in his years in power.The sanctity of life is important, either it be one life or a million lives, Jung Chang writes with the notion that a crime lies in the numbers. Jung Chang tells her story covering with one hand the attrocities of the nationalists and magnifying the attrocities of Mao, putting them on different scales to perpetuate her biased view.<br /><br />She fails to give any synthesizing capacity to her readers as she hastily infers the motives behind Mao's every move even his fart. She fails to discern the mind of Mao, for from the first page she is too eager, maybe too eager, to perpetuate the \\"truth\\" of the monster Mao. Thus her book is a classic in misinterpreting the truth.<br /><br />I believed Mao committed atrocious crimes and abused power and I also believe that Jung Chang did not keep fidelity to the truth as she synthesized the truth for untruths. Chang weakened the truth by exaggerating it and thereby opening the backdoor of sainthood to Mao.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Out of all Jane Austen's literary works Pride and Prejudice is the novel most people identify with her.  It is a story similar to many other masterpieces, as it tells a story of love.  Yet, it is so much more than a mere love story that unites aching hearts.  It brings out the strong patriarchal traditions and social class system that governs the society at the turn of the century between the 18th and 19th century.  Aristocratic women at this time avoided physical labor while prudently sitting still much like well-trained lap dogs in order to attract a proper suitor with high social status, wealth, and refined etiquette.  Thus, love was something secondary, as marriage provided the means for a woman to function with some freedom within in a society with intricate and rigorous rules.  Austen thought differently, and subtly assaulted the establishment with eloquent wit and delicate humor in her tour de force.<br /><br />Joe Wright is not the first director to attempt to provide a cinematic version of Austen's celebrated novel.  Two handfuls of adaptations have retold the story of Pride and Prejudice, yet Wright succeeds in delivering one of the best.  He remains true to the novel (despite its short format), while also capturing the social atmosphere in a genuine manner.  Besides applying the proper etiquette in a convincing manner, Wright makes sure that the film also looks authentic through details of muddy hems and the real class difference between people emerges through the actors' costumes.  Wright also enhances the storyline with breathtaking scenery ranging from dewy dawns at the edge of the forest to death springing cliffs, which helps to artistically reveal the emotional and social situation of the moment.  Much of this is also thanks to the terrific cinematography in the film by Roman Oshin.<br /><br />The opening shot displays the sun emerging above the tree line while the song of birds accompanied by a lone piano aurally enhance the scene.  The dawning obviously suggests in a symbolic way of a new beginning, as Pride & Prejudice is about to take its course.  In the very next shot, Elizabeth \\"Lizzy\\" Bennet (Keira Knightley) wanders a meadow while finishing a book.  The contrasting elements in these two sequential scenes provide a slight hint toward Lizzy's delicate rebelliousness, which is augmented by her sisters tendency to remain at home while she gladly roam the outdoors by herself.  The slight social disobedience that Lizzy possesses presents the major reason why the story takes place at all, as all other female characters around them follow the traditional rules that govern them.<br /><br />Lizzy's footsteps lead her home where the story quickly begins to take form, as it becomes known that Mr. Bingley (Simon Wood) has arrived to the Netherfield Park and he collects a substantial annual income.  Along with the wealth he has a high-ranking social status and is single.  The mother Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) rapidly begins to plan for her daughters to meet the gentleman, as her lot in life is to make sure that her daughters get married.  Meanwhile, her husband, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), leisurely goes about his business to study plants and insects, as all five of his daughters are preparing to meet the gentleman.  It is yet another subtle illustration of males' acquired superior status due to a chromosome that eventually makes them men.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Mr. Bingley falls in love with Jane Bennet (Rosamund Pike) and he begins to court her.  At the same time, Lizzy finds her heart crushed by Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who plays the status card against her, and Lizzy decides to hate him for all eternity.  Ellizabeth also learns about a family secret between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend), which only increases her contempt for Mr. Darcy.  In the process, Elizabeth learns that Mr. Bingley has abandoned his pursuit for Jane's heart and hand.  Amidst of all this, Elizabeth also declines (something unheard of at the time) a marriage with her wealthy and distant cousin.  Instead the cousin marries her best friend, and the plot continues to thicken when she is invited to stay with her friend, as she also meets Mr. Darcy again who seems to have an ulterior agenda.<br /><br />If the viewers have not read the book by Austen, the film will certainly present a deep appreciation for her literary cunningness.  The many side plots keep the audience intrigued while the focus follows whether the truly beloved will find one another.  Yet, underneath this overt love story, Austen presents a true image of a woman's lot in life, which Wright skillfully captures.  Another aspect that makes this story unique is its deep understanding of human cognition besides the social message, which shines through its profound use of generalizations, assumptions, and preconceived notions.  Many of the cast members help bring out the many qualities in the script in a brilliant manner with the performing highlights in Keira Knightley, Brenda Blethyn, and Donald Sutherland.  Keira Knightly received an Oscar nomination her part as Lizzy, but I feel that Brenda Blethyn was robbed from a supporting role nomination, as the energetically scheming mother.  In the end, Pride & Prejudice presents an adaptation worthy of Austen's literary dexterity, which entertains and offers contemplation to those who seek something meaningful.declines (something unheard of at the time) a marriage with her wealthy and distant cousin.

006056251X|5.0|I don't see how anyone cannot love this 3rd book in Kleypas' Wallflower series.  I like it as much as It Happened One Autumn, both providing superb romantic tension of two opposites believably brought together.  In both I sensed the pairing of the romantic heroes were going to be terrific from the epilogue of the previous book, and Kleypas delivers on this promise.  Her weakest book and characters in this series is actually the first. <br /> <br />I thought she was going to draw out St. Vincent's libertine behavior in a societal setting (the cover is very misleading in this sense), but though she sets the story in a traveling coach, an inn, and mostly in a gambling house, she maintains the romance to a understated but intense pitch.  I thought the erotic scenes were captivating, and why shouldn't they, with sexy Sebastian?  Reforming such a hardened, selfish rake in a believable manner was a challenge, but she pulls it off with Evie's subtle stubborness and self-possession beneath her shyness, now explained with her backstory. <br /> <br />What I like best about Kleypas in such novels is she doesn't turn her male heroes into eunuchs, ummanning them halfway into the story into lovey dovey she-men spouting mushy, sentimental claptrap.  Her men retain their male virility, and the attractiveness that comes from their masculinity, right down to the very end.  If we wanted men who acted and sounded like women, we probably wouldn't read romance novels. <br /> <br />Unlike one reviewer, I don't think the two main plots against Evie clash at all, and are meant to be mere subplots. Though the missing societal functions is unusual and unexpected, Kleypas makes up for this omission with plenty of inner and outer intrigue at the gambling house.   <br /> <br />I am intrigued now by Daisy's story: will it involve Cam Rohan, in that deliciously surprising scene in the secret room, or this shy Mr. Smith?  One part that puzzled me (besides the cover) is everyone referring to Rohan asa \\"boy\\" of 25. Still, I hope they both grow up a bit before she brings them together.   <br /> <br />Along with Dreaming of You and the previous book in this series, this is her best!
B00006JSS8|2.0|Have the people who re-mixed the songs on this album ever heard the original recordings?  Fingertips,(I'm not even sure where this recording even came from) dosen't sound like the same 12 year old that I remember on the 45. Superstition?  the percusion at the begining, WHERE IS IT???  Living For the City, (the begining to this song used to bring shivers, but this is disapointing, no soul here!!)  This mix sucks!!!   I bought this because I was thinking I would like to have a fresh version of all these wonderful songs (no pun intended), but what I got was inspiration to listen to my old albums and 45's where I can at least get the original \\"FEEL\\" for these great songs.
B000024D4R|5.0|To be perfectly honest, this is without question the most overlooked, ignored album I have ever come across. In terms of the power of its driving concept, Animals could have easily bested The Wall. The idea behind the album is the division of the human race into three categories; Dogs (aggressive power-seekers), Pigs (greedy capitalist businessmen), and Sheep (mindless, blind followers), respectively. As I said, this album could have easily been more popular than The Wall, but, as it were, people were (and still are) somewhat put off by long, drawn out songs. This simple fact doomed Animals even as it was being written (the three main songs on the album are 17:04, 11:28, and 10:16). If you don't mind listening to a song for longer than you're used to, I would definately recommend this album. It really is musical genius.
B0000047CX|5.0|One of the most melodic and appealing of jazz albums. Getz, Joao Gilberto, and Astrud Gilberto make for a formidable and winning team. Pure pleasure.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|When I saw that there was yet another version of Pride and Prejudice being released, I was a bit skeptical that anything new could be done to bring Austen's book alive on screen.  I loved the book, and I loved the old Olivier version of the film.  My skepticism disappeared as I watched the film, however. <br /> <br />Yes, the script departs from the novel, but that's to be expected.  What I truly enjoyed was that the characters were portrayed in a way that I'd always imagined.  Mr. Bennett is long-suffering and sweet, with a wry wit.  Mrs. Bennett is a hilarious busybody, who really does love her daughters.  Jane is beautiful and dignified.  Elizabeth is sassy, smart, and stubborn.  Mr. Darcy is (very) handsome and dashing, while still being endearingly socially awkward.   Mr. Collins is wonderfully icky. <br /> <br />Another thing I enjoyed was that many of the scenes were beautifully shot. Mr. Darcy's quick doubletake when he sees Elizabeth at the party, and the close shot of him flexing his hand after helping Elizabeth from the carriage are wonderful.  The near-kiss scene during the rainstorm could make even very sensible women feel a bit fluttery.  The gorgeous scenery-- magnificent old houses, gnarled old trees, foggy meadows-- add to the romance of the film.  <br /> <br />I do have two quarrels with the film, however.  The two youngest Bennett sisters are a bit too giddy, and their giggling becomes tiresome after a while.  Also, the ending was more sappy than romantic.   <br /> <br />I first watched the film last night, ordered it today, and can't wait to watch it again.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I've read reviews that this movie is \\"memorable\\" and an intense experience, but I fail to see that.  I guess the most memorable part of the experience when I saw this in the theater is the argument I had with the theater owner in trying to get my money back. This movie truly made me laugh, as it did the rest of the theater (we're talkin underage movie-sneakers to the elderly here, folks).     I'm a huge fan of the bad guy, and there are few movies I've seen where the villains win, with \\"Fallen\\" being my favorite. I had high hopes that I could add another to the list, but was let down.    Seriously, for the way it was hyped up, this movie turned out to be disappointing, with more T&A then blood, and a plot line that I figured out within 20 minutes. I guess it was kinda fun to watch others around me react with surprise, while I just watched the damn thing unfold.    So, now I read that they've suckered enough people to get the funds to start with \\"Hostel 2\\"  Expect this to be a dimly-lit take on the whole \\"We found out about this place, so we're going to check it out and find that the 'big bad guy' in the first movie is actually a puppet of some greater entity that somehow relates to someone in the original cast,\\" much like the killer in \\"Scream 3\\" being revealed as Sid's brother. If you truly must see this movie to see what it's about, rent first.  If anyone had to be taken out of the theater because they passed out at the \\"graphic\\" scenes, they must have been narcoleptics.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|I rented this film after having listened to my high school students rave about how great it was, and boy, do I wish I had my money back.  This very well could be the worst film I've ever seen.   <br /> <br />First, the characters are detestable.  They are angry at their former friend because he expects them to pay rent.  Paying bills is what grownups do...why do they feel they should be exempt?  Additionally, they are rude to everyone they meet.  As a struggling college student, I worked many low-paying jobs in the service industry, and I was far more able to put myself in the employees' shoes while watching the main characters trash a restaurant.  Maybe if they weren't trying so hard to be shocking and provocative, they might have time to be happy-- or at the very least-- find a job and pay the rent.  I've experienced poverty firsthand, and it doesn't look anything like what was portrayed in the film. <br /> <br />Second, the writing was sophomoric.  Many of the songs seemed like tuneless narration of the plot.  I muttered \\"You've got to be kidding\\" in reaction to the dialogue multiple times throughout the film and must admit that I fast-forwarded through a good portion of the songs.  For instance, Rosario Dawson's character is supposedly near death at one point, and her love interest sings, \\"Don't leave me alone with my guitar.\\"  Egad.  A good musical has you humming the tunes long after you've finished watching it, but I found all of these utterly forgettable.  <br /> <br />Third, the film is supposed to be set in 1989. Anachronisms abound!  Only one character is dressed appropriately for the time period, but because he is the only one thus attired he just looks like the group's unfashionable friend.  <br /> <br />If you want to see a meaningful film about AIDS, see Philadelphia.  If you want to see a harrowing account of heroin addiction, see Trainspotting. If you want a heartbreaking tale of someone struggling with sexual identity, see Boys Don't Cry.  If you want characters attempting to claw their way out of poverty in search of stardom, see Hoop Dreams, Coal Miner's Daughter, or if you're very brave-- Requiem for a Dream.  If you want an amazing love story that triumphs over adversity, see Walk the Line.  This film attempts to address all these issues and fails miserably.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I never got a change to see this movie in the theater, so the first time I saw this picture was after my wife bought it for me for my birthday.  I had never seen the Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, but I had read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when I was younger.  While the movie does not follow the book verbatim, it does a good job of capturing the fell that I remember from reading the story.  Johnny Depp does a wonderful job playing the roll of Willy Wonka even from behind those silly glasses.  Even more impressive to me was the performance of Deep Roy (plays the Ooompa Loompas) who had me laughing at his every appearance with a witty (and always silly) musical number.  All of the actors playing the children did a very good job of portraying their obnoxious characters.  One my object that everyone is a caricature and that the story is over the top, but that is the key to making this movie as entertaining as it is.  This is definitely a movie to watch again and again, particularly when one is feeling down and in the need of a good cheering up.
B0009YA37W|2.0|This band keeps getting compared to Interpol and sometimes the Killers when  really, aside from the fact that they seem to have ripped some of their songs beat by beat, they are nowhere near as successful as those other bands in their delivery! The song Munich (one which I'd associate the most with Interpol) does have a catchy hook, but the rest of the album fails to capture the same magic. I hope they continue exploring their sound and I wish them well, but as things stand, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it. It's just not one of those albums that you can play all the way through and without skipping over some songs (like you can 'Turn on the Bright Lights' or 'Hot Fuss'). <br /> <br />Ultimately, one gets the feeling that they are just trying to cash in on the current trend in music and creating forgettable material in the process. <br />
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I absolutely love RENT. It is an amazing story that is provacative, witty, and wonderful. It is great on stage but loses some of the best stuff on the big screen. Most of the music was cut out of the movie, and even 2/3 of the emotional overload \\"Goodbye Love\\". But it could have been much, much worse. <br /> <br />Many people would have felt that Spike Lee would have made a more adequet director than Chris Columbus. I don't really think that is true. Chris Columbus tried his best and pushed the cast beyond their limits, if you noticed in the film there are significant parts where there is no cut for a very long time. I personally think that Spike Lee would have been a horrible director. He wanted to cast Justin Timberlake as Roger!! That would ruin everything for me and many other RENTheads. If anything Chris Columbus did the film and the characters some justice the only way that he could, by getting the original cast members. <br /> <br />The cast still has some of its old groove. Although older there a little wiser and have better voices. Adam Pascal can still send shivers down the spine. And although that Daphne Rubin-Vega had a little rasp in her voice, I still miss it over Rosario Dawson's. And as much I hate to admit it but the addition of Tracie Thoms was a better choice then Fredi Walker, the original Joanne (hear that high note!) <br /> <br />As a musician myself the songs are amazing and intricate, and hold a lot of meaning. <br /> <br />Although the movie was really good, it was missing some key things that it good, and how i feel in love with it in the first place. And even though i love the movie, i would choose the musical live over it any day.  <br /> <br />Now for anyone who loved RENT, and liked or is interested in seeing the Broadway production, please visit this site.

0446310786|5.0|<br /> <br />   To Kill A Mockingbird is a must read. Harper Lee has just actually drawn out the entire book by using descriptive scenes, Southern dialogues, and a variety of mood. She also vividly described the 1930s typical town environment that mingles with the Great Depression. Harper Lee has placed herself in a 6 year-old child's feet, giving the readers a funny and enjoyable perspective of what a little girl would think of reality and the cruel world. <br /> <br />  The story begins when Scout (the narrator and the major character) introduces and brings us back to her past during the year where her brother broke his arm.  The book portrays Scout as a child who is advanced her age. Her behavior and actions are barely like a girl, but more like a carefree boy. Instead of crying and screaming when she is upset, she punches people. During the story, many conflicts happen. Scout and his friends try to force a spooky and notorious man out of his house. They later also witness the case where his father defends an African American who is accused of raping a white girl. This case hits disturbing waves in the town, causing his father's reputation to go down.  <br /> <br />  Even though this book is nearly 300 pages, it becomes very short when one starts reading. Other than the major conflict of the \\"Rape\\" case, the book contains paragraphs anecdotes, characters' analysis, and setting portrayals. And because of these, the entire story seems more like a picture rather than a literature. Reading the novel, you can see many elements such as the problem of discrimination, prejudice, class, and sex. This novel is like 2 books in one: an adventure and a history book. I would advise people to read this book for sure. It wins a 100% of my approval and recognition!  <br />
B0000028M7|5.0|This is an essentail album for anyone who loves grunge. the lyrics are amazing. its all very good and who doesnt love songs about drugs and death?    Songs:      Them Bones: 9.5/10 Great and the solo is my favorite from jerry. the song is short but is great and is nothing short of fantastic. i would think it is the most heavy song on the album    Dam That River: 9/10 Another great song i think its about beating up someone up and is heavy just like them bones as listed above this song has a solo as well but not as short and the solo is a lot worse.    Rain When I Die: 7/10 Not the best but its listenable at least it has a very nice bass thump to start.    Down In a Hole: 9.7 Epic im serious to me it is a lot like love hate love and is well... emotional and mello    Sickman: 8/10 Decent it is but its sorta filler sounding just the way it starts makes you instantly think filler but after a few times it gets ok    Rooster: 10/10 Great. the best song on the album. howerver it doesnt fit in with the rest of the songs. the song is about war and surviving while others are diyng and the rest is about the opposite. it has cool lyrics like alice in chains has a knack for \\"aint found away to kill me yet eyes burn with stinging sweat seems every path leads me to nowhere; wife and kids house hold pet army green was no safe bet the bullet screams to me from somewhere yeah the come snuff the rooster oh yeah; here comes the rooster yeah you know he aint gonna die\\" ya these are good.    Junkhead: 8/10 Very good but the the live version is a lot better    Godsmack: 9/10 Good song but the part i dont like is a band stole it from AIC that goes to falloutboy lover who says that they stole it when godsmack stole it from alice in chains. alice in chains DID NOT steal it from godsmack    Dirt: 9.2/10 Good but could be better. live version is also better. the start is awesome    Iron Gland: 7/10 Filler-ific but is making fun of the song Iron Man it just laughs its pretty much the heaviest 45second song ever    Hate to Feel: 6/10 Not very good just is not good music not suiting to the great lyrics    Angry Chair: 9.3/10 The grungiest song ever but i like it, it might sound like a prequel to head creeps because it sounds un rehearsed if you want un rehearsed just listen to green day live or my chemical romance live the both suck and are way off because they are worthless emo pop.    Would: 10/10 Another epic song and a great way to end an epic album
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Short and to the point..this was an absolutely wonderful film! Im not a big Cash fan, but this movie defiantely gives you a new appreciation of the man. The performances are amazing, the music is well done, and it really is a moving story!! Plain and simple....This is a great film that's well worth the money!!!!
B00004U8H4|2.0|I bought this film for a good price having heard alot about it and with the word psycho in the title, I just had to see it. The only good thing about this movie is the bloody killing scenes. Other than that, I found this movie boring at times. To call it terrifying is going a bit too far. Even scary is a bit too far. If you like the serial killer type movies, you might like this one but don't be prepared to be blown away!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I have been a long time Zeppelin fan, and I also enjoyed most of Roberts solo works, but this simply blows them all away!! At 56 years old, Robert still sounds amazing!!!!! That plus a great new band make this a truly astounding record. If you didnt know any better you would swear the man doesnt age. He can still sing, and while there are no real shrieks on here, the man still rocks!! Check this out if you are a music fan of any genre (except rap!) Anybody who truly appreciates good music by talented individuals, this is for you!!!
B00005JO20|3.0|I don't quite understand all the 5 star ratings for this movie when compared to the 1976 remake of King Kong. In my opinion, that remake was much better than this one was. I saw this new King Kong at the theater and couldn't wait to see it for I'm a huge Kong fan. I will say that Naomi Watts gave a good performance but I was not impressed by Jack Black's performance as a filmmaker in this movie. The over 3 hour long movie does past by fast but I found the first half rather boring! It seems like they will never arrive at Skull Island. I will say that their rendention of Skull Island was beautiful. The whole movie had beautiful scenery and great special effects. However, I could have done without all the dinosaurs in this movie. It almost made me feel like I was watching Jurassic Park! and all the huge bugs..... kindy silly even though the point of these huge bugs was to show us that everything on Skull Island grew to great proportions..... including the 8th wonder of the world..... Kong! Although good, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I found there was too much animation in this movie unlike the 1976 version which didn't contain an animated Kong, making Kong look much more real. Congrats to Peter Jackson for his success in making this movie. Even though not extremely impressed with this remake, I will buy it when it is released on DVD on March 28th, just to add to my Kong collection.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|THEATRICAL VERSION (Approx. 137 Minutes):<br /><br />David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel \\"Dune\\" is an awe-inspiring, lavish production that features impressive visual effects, as well as fine performances by an all-star cast, including Kyle MacLachlan in an empressive turn as Paul Atreides, the son of a Duke who becomes the messianic legend of the Fremen.<br /><br />Sadly, the theatrical edition is a letdown. Due to some hodge-podge editing, the plot is confusing; during the first half of the film, things fly by at a rate that the viewer cannot easily assimilate. Though the action, visual effects, and acting make up for most of it in the second half, the shorter version is a disappointment.<br /><br />THE EXTENDED EDITION (Approx. 177 Minutes):<br /><br />While David Lynch didn't approve of the extended version of the film, \\"Dune\\" fans will. Although the forty minutes of additional footage doesn't add anything \\"necessary\\" in terms of character development and action, it makes things run more smoothly. The plot is less confusing, and the movie runs more smoothly, thanks to some sharper editing. Still, it will take more than one viewing to \\"get it all,\\" but it is a fascinating film full of intriguing characters, breathtaking action, and top-notch visual effects.<br /><br />THE DVD:<br /><br />Both versions of the film feature a stellar audio track, and the picture looks better than ever before. The four featurettes give great insight into the making of this thrilling motion picture, while the deleted scenes and photo gallery are a treasure for film buffs. \\"Dune\\" fans will not be disappointed in this edition.<br /><br />Theatrical Cut Grade: B-<br /><br />Extended Edition Grade: A-<br /><br />DVD Grade: A+
0689859414|5.0|This is a great book for your collection for adults and children alike. It has great detail and is a very interesting read.  We liked it so much we even bought one for our school library.  It is a must have if you read the Spiderwick chronicles. <br />
B00005JO1R|4.0|A dilemna here.  I loved the movie- think the performances are just terrific.  The sound and video are really top-notch and the music really enjoyable.  I also enjoyed the deleted scens on the first disc and really to think this is a movie worth adding to the personal collection.  The problem I have is the features added to the 2-disc collection.  They just are not very good. An example- a special on the Folsom Prison concert- clearly one of the most important steps in Cash's career.  The special, though it has interesting excerpts of interviews from people who were there, does not have any footage or stills of the actual concert.  I found the same to be true of the other specials on the disc as well.  Lots of shots of the two stars but very little of the \\"Man in Black\\" himself. I would encourage people to buy the movie but to skip the special edition.  It just is not worth the extra money, unless you really need five postcards of the stars from the film.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki did it again. It is a fantastic animation movies. It has a great quality pictures, nice plot, and wonderful story.
B00003CXA2|3.0|This film might be taken to be many things--an autobiography, history, comedy, war film, but at its heart lies an allegorical sort of epitaph for a wild era in American history (1960s-70s); a psychological catharsis. (Warning: this review has spoilers)     We seem to be told that everything about our protagonist derives from the singular trait that he is a little bit dumb. Yet there is more to Forrest Gump than being a little bit dumb. He is also a 'little bit' innocent, a 'little bit' hardworking, a 'little bit' selfless (and a 'little bit' lucky, at least in regards to his personal affairs). Ultimately, our narrator Forrest seems to fill the role of an angelic ideal, like Dante wandering through the depths of Hell in the Divine Comedy; like a man who has never eaten from the Tree of Knowledge stumbling through the depicted darkness of postwar America.     T.S. Eliot once remarked, \\"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time\\"-- and this seems to apply aptly here. Each time we return to the bus bench with Forrest, at the end when we return to the feather, we see the same things, yet know their meaning for the first time. And has Jenny, the female charge of our angelic Dante, our bird which has flown far, far away, to college, to a singing career, through the antiwar movement, waitressing, and finally an AIDS victim, arrived back where she started in that wheat field behind her father's home: alone with Forrest by her side, only to know him, his simple kind of love, for the first time? (It's an interesting plug for all the 'Nice Guys' who can never get a break, isn't it?)    Yet unlike what perhaps this film suggests, Jenny was not wrong to want to fly (even if the directions of that flight were not as fortuitous), and we should not refrain from exploring in life for ourselves. Forrest certainly never did, even though for him it was an inadvertent journey. His saintlycharacter seems at one level to be a stunning example of some writer's indictment by contrast of American culture-- presumably his own generation. Yet the morality play only works because our stories of Gump's earthly charges-- Bubba, \\"Lt. Dan\\", Jenny, are tragic ones-- while Forrest's is not. As if God's hand in his infinite justice were reaching down and placing the virtuous Gump in the most opportune positions, even as the world seems lost around him. Unfortunately, us mortals in the real world cannot truly live up to the model this movie holds forth. Imperfect and living in a world where guile and self-interest pay off, descended from the fallen Adam and Eve, we are more like Lt. Dan and Jenny than Forrest.     Yet the tragic characters herein aside, it is important to remember that the risks inherent in life, and the moral sacrifices to self-interest sometimes required, are never a justification for turning one's back on it, even if none of us will be as effortlessly successful as Forrest. Let us not take from this a message of despair. It is not necessary to be an angelic idiot in order to do substantial good in this world. And if our explorations in life bring us back to that place where we started, if complexity's chaos and confusion become brittle and melt into love, it is also true that love compels us to live life nonetheless, to pursue our dreams and fly as far as we can. (Even if only so that perhaps one day, we may look back again at what we had at the beginning with understanding eyes, and know it for the first time).     The final scene in this film shows young Forrest Jr. boarding a school bus, the smartest kid in his class (thus presumably an imperfect mortal, like his mother), ready to face life's new adventures. Where will it lead him? None of us would deny him the chance to find out. So, if this film inspired in you a thoughtful catharsis, I would think of it not as an indictment of a postwar generation that reached out ambitiously and optimistically, or of a culture uniquely American, but as a place of wisdom from which to begin again.

B000C1YL1G|4.0|Okay, i love most of the songs on it and I love em, but Fack just is terrible, it's the worst song I've ever heard before. I recommend just buying all 4 of his CDs (Contain most of these songs), downloading \\"When I'm Gone\\", buying The Blueprint (Which has an ill song from Curtain Call, \\"Renagade\\", and is just a great album).
B000AL730Y|2.0|I feel like the skunk at the wedding reception.  Sorry, Paul, just two stars from me.      People are calling this a masterpiece and \\"his best in years\\".   (Okay, considering it's his first studio album in four years, I suppose it is his best in years -- four years.)  But this CD has done more to shake my lofty opinion of McCartney than any of his records since \\"Press to Play\\" in '86 - not  because it stinks, but because it is just another in an endless rut of ho-hum albums - the last straw, as it were.      Paul has written a few good melodies as usual, but his \\"dummy\\" lyrics torpedo this album (not the first McCartney album to be saddled with gimpy lyrics).  I've just about had it with songs where the lyrics of the verses have no thematic connection to the lyrics of the chorus or bridge.  It's as if he can't concentrate long enough to write a coherent song.  Take \\"At the Mercy\\":  \\"At the mercy of a busy road, who can handle such a heavy load... // If you show me love I won't refuse, I know you'd never make me choose between the love I've got and the love I'd lose...\\"  Huh??  Just ponder that for a minute.  Let's see - roads & loads; love; choosing the love you have and losing it at the same time.  It's gibberish.  Utter nonsense.  Heck, pick almost any song here and you'll find the same flaw.     Musically the album sort of dribbles in one ear and out the other.  The tunes are attractive but, thanks to the rankling lyrics, they're ruined.  Parts of the album have a very high cringe factor (the awkward solo on \\"English Tea,\\" \\"Promise to You Girl\\" in its entirety), though with all the similar and timid arrangements, most of the record will simply have you shifting your rump impatiently in your chair.  And good grief, what's with that piece of junk tacked on at the end?  At least it's an instrumental - no incoherent lyrics.    One better moment is \\"How Kind of You.\\"  The track builds nicely and it sounds great turned up loud. As a bonus, the lyrics almost make sense.But, sadly, there's not one future McCartney classic on this record.    Perhaps we fans have lost our objectivity when it comes to Paul McCartney.  We want to believe he still \\"has it\\" (hence, trying to convince ourselves with all the great reviews), but with one half-baked Macca album after another, it's getting harder to keep the faith.  If this is all he can come up with when he applies himself, he needs to take another tack - find a collaborator who can write lyrics.  (How about Pete Townshend or Ray Davies??  Wouldn't you like to hear that?  More with Elvis Costello would be great, too.)  Or maybe I just need to lower my expectations.     In any event, Ringo is making much better records these days than Paul, and I would expect most fans gradually to revise their opinions of \\"Chaos\\" significantly downward.  \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" isn't Paul's worst album (that's \\"Wild Life\\") but it is easily his most overrated.  Guess I'll just sigh and hope, yet again, for something better in another four or five years.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|I loved it! Bat Out of Hell is the definition of true rock and roll. You haven't heard anything until you've actually heard this blaring on a radio. My favorite was For Crying Out Loud. It's the best love song ever. I can listen to it over and over. I can listen to the whole cd over and over. Meat Loaf has the kind of voice that really gets into you when he sings. It just takes you into the song and you understand it all. I think that he's the best musician ever. I don't care if teachers say that Sebastian Bach or someone else is the best. They can just bite me! I think that we should learn about rock and roll in the classroom along with everything else they stuff into our heads. Bat Out of Hell is the best album ever.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I absolutely hate it when people call Sigur Rós ethereal.  Or calming, or 'out of this world'.  I can understand the sentiment, but it conveys a New Age-y detatchment which detracts from the band's power. <br /> <br />I would rather say that Sigur Rós IS of this world, that they are reflecting our world and creating a heightened image of what we could be.  Sigur Rós is one of the most viscerally affecting bands I have ever seen perform.  The absolute emotion that overpowers you is all-encompassing, your entire body vibrates with sound.  Anyone who has seen them live knows the riveting awestruck horror you feel as the world seemingly crashes to a fiery death as they close with Untitled #8, somewhat ironically nicknamed Popplagið, or Pop Song.  <br /> <br />I am a huge fan of 'ending songs', and I often view the beginning of a band's next album as a continuation, or a rebirth.  Takk..., in this case, is a rebirth full of hope and beauty and strings and growing light at dawn, like some heaven peeking through the clouds.  It launches from there into Glósóli, and when Jónsi first takes the bow to his guitar, it's like returning home.  And then it bursts into triumphant childlike innnocent joy at the end.  If you've not seen the music video, it is absolutely necessary. <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />Hoppípolla is joyous once more, but carefree true to the title, which means Hopping Into Puddles, and its theme returns in Með Blóðnasir.  Sé Lest continues the joy with some silliness and a brass band.  Sæglópur is, as reviewers have said, the centrepiece of the album.  Starting with a series of piano chords almost remeniscent of Radiohead's Climbing Up The Walls, it is a journey piece.  As the title means A Lost Seafarer, one can almost imagine a ship cresting over choppy Atlantic waters, and a lone seafarer at the top of the crow's nest staring into the wind, searching for home.  It builds up into the same drum and strings explosion as Glósóli, and yet whenit launches into a drum-free, soaring bridge and Jónsi starts to actually sing in Icelandic, it  lifts off into the air instead of returning to what you would expect would be the crashing end.  Mílanó is perhaps the seafarer finding its home in Milan.  If you listen closely to the end of Mílanó, you can hear a string theme that repeats with the eerie, twilight beginning of Gong.  Gong is an autumn song, it is driving along the coast and arriving at the beach on a cold day, with Andvari.  <br /> <br />Andvari seems to be the most underrated song on this album.  The same pre-theme happens at the end of Gong, and the first time I heard it I was immediately hooked.  It's the perfect lullabye, and the violins that lead out the end of the song are like waves, rocking you to sleep as the sun sets.  It is the ships sailing into the west at the end of the Return of the King. <br /> <br />You think it's over, almost, until Svo Hljótt brings you back with grandeur.  It's the same kind of awe you might feel during Viðrar vel til loftárása.  Like you've been climbing a mountain, impossibly tall, and the storm has broken but you're surrounded by fog, and as the song coalesces [at 4:47] all of a sudden everything clears, and you're at the top.  Suddenly, you can see everything, and you're higher than everything else, and everything you can see is beautiful. <br /> <br />Kjartan, the band's drummer, said this about Heysátan:  <br /> <br />\\"With Heysátan my idea of it after we wrote it, was that there was an old man looking over his field, a big view over the sea or something, and he is dying. He is going to die. He is just lying on the grass, and he is going to die, but that is fine because he has had a good life. He is quite happy dying, actually. And that is what the song is to me. It's kind of that emotion.\\" <br /> <br />Quite a different end from Untitled #8, that's for sure.  I can't wait to see where they take us from here.  When you talk about Sigur Rós, you start out with small technical aspects; sounds and instruments.  But you always end up with emotions.  It's impossible not to.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|You've got to hand it to Joss Whedon.  The Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator has taken his much beloved, and all too shortly lived, series Firefly and made it into something truly special on the big screen.  Serenity, like Firefly before it, is everything that science fiction should be and then some: loaded with ideas and a sense of wonder and awe.  And because it's from the mind of Joss Whedon, you can expect Serenity to be everything something from Whedon should be: smart, loaded with snappy dialogue, intricately plotted, and full of memorable characters.  Picking up where the series left off, Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and the crew of Serenity are soon on the run from the Alliance who are after the mysterious River (Summer Glau) because of what she knows.  And what she knows could change everything.  Everyone from the series is back, including Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Morena Baccarin, and the rest; as they all soon find themselves in over their heads.  The only downside of Serenity is that for a briskly paced film that's two full hours long, it's over all too quickly; but it ends with the hope that there's more in store for the crew of Serenity in the future.  You've got to hand it to Joss; he pulled off what no one (other than devoted Firefly fans) thought he could, and it's certainly better than anything to come out the past few years taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is Harper Lee's only novel and it clearly reflects how society is during the 1930s. The story takes place in Maycomb County, a fictional town in Alabama. Scout and Jem are two innocent children who think that the world, along with everything inside it, is good. However, their perspective changed gradually with their father, Atticus, who was to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the story, we get a peek of children's imagination and curiosity as they try to get Boo Radley to come of the house. Eventually, as the Tom Robinson trial begins, they began to see how cruel people can be towards others. The children eventually become more mature as they realize that adults, although mostly good, still have their blind spots like everyone else. <br /> <br />Family is an important aspect of this story. From the conversations between Atticus and his children, one can tell immediately how great a father Atticus is. He is not only wise and humble, but caring as well. By teaching the children to stand up for what they believe even if others would despise them for it, Atticus wanted them to be righteous just like him. By defending Tom, he is setting a good example for Scout and Jem to follow. <br /> <br />This novel contains many morals that one can unveil by carefully reading the book. Harper has a talent for capturing the reader's attention the moment they started reading the book. Throughout the novel, the reader's heart follows the plot of the story going up and down. One can actually feel being in the audience as the court progresses. It is a sin for not reading this great classic by Harper Lee!
038533348X|5.0|This book is a must read.  It is a very short book, with almost as many chapters as pages.  It reads like book crack and you won't be able to stop till your finished.  If you haven't read other books by KV then this is a good place to start.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Such a treat, to see Pride and Prejudice again! For anyone who knows and loves the book -- and knows and loves the BBC miniseries from 1995 -- this new version is worth seeing. Yes, it is not as genteel as the BBC version. There is a rough quality to the characters' lives that is perhaps more authentic. Here, we see Bennets living in a low-ceilinged house with narrow doorways, candlelight, plank floors and simple furniture. They use more pewter than silver, and their clothing is closer to homespun 18th-century, than 19th-century finery. The language is simpler, less flowery and less faithful to Jane Austen's dialog. So what? I sat in a theatre crowded with women and men who laughed out loud and even applauded when they felt moved to do so. The ending was too sugary-sweet, I will give you that. But this version is not without merit! Austen lovers, don't hesitate to see this version.
0143034901|3.0|I was ecstatic when I first started reading this book.  Finally I had found another \\"Name of the Rose.\\"  Unfortunately, about half way through I couldn't help but notice the accumulation of cliche phrases - that we'll all heard before, too many times - where it seemed that a little more effort on the writer's or translator's part would have worked so much better.  Given how many of these cliches I found, I can't imagine that they are also in the original text.  What chance is there that the Spanish have the same cliches as we do, but in their native tongue?  Thus, I credit this issue with the translator.<br /><br />Also in the second half I started to find long narratives, explaining the story, as if the author felt too rushed to tell us the story through active scenes.  Yes, the narrative is in one of the character's voices, but that doesn't excuse the lack of drama.<br /><br />All in all it's a very interesting story.  But I will not keep it as one of my treasures to read again.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Walk The Line is a rare kind of film; it has commercial appeal, but it remains honest in portraying its main character(s).  The story follows the rise and brief fall (before rising again) of music legend Johnny Cash.  A struggling door-to-door salesman, Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) likes to play guitar and sing with his two closest pals, much to the chagrin of his wife.  One day while wandering through downtown Memphis, Johnny stumbles upon Sam Phillips' Sun recording studio, where he sees and hears Elvis Presley cutting a disc.  Johnny tracks down Mr. Phillips and convinces him to hear his band.  Phillips requires convincing, but he eventually agrees to take a chance on Cash.  Their initial record is a hit, and they find themselves on the road with Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and June Carter(Reese Witherspoon), who descends from a famous singing family.  Johnny and June have an obvious chemistry almost immediately.  This is a problem, because not only is Johnny a married father, June, also a parent, is just getting through a divorce, which in 1956 was still considered morally scandalous. <br />The film continues through Johnny's initial struggle with drugs and his attempts to win his father's approval, as well as his tumultous relationship with June.  The music is presented in an exciting way, thanks to Phoenix's ability to capture Cash's onstage charisma.  Phoenix and Witherspoon, both novice singers prior to the film, both do well.  Phoenix's Cash starts out rough around the edges musically, and gets more polished.  Witherspoon sounds like a natural country singer. Both actors deliver terrific performances.  This is a very entertainging ride.  Final Grade: A

0446577383|3.0|David Baldacci is a wonderful story teller and he continues to use that ability in this book.  However, in this book he has a message which is that America has to be more understanding of the Muslem world and that world peace requires mutual respect.  Unfortunately he does not have the depth or ability to make this argument and he lets his political views get in the way of a good story with some of his wonderful characters.  There are too many speeches and too many unbelievable coincidences. <br /> <br />Baldacci has had the ability to paint wonderful characters.  In this book Lucky and the background of the members of the Camel Club are interesting.   <br /> <br />As one reviewer said a weak Baldacci is still worth while but not nearly as satisfying as the real thing.  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Like Star Wars if everyone were Han Solo.\\"  That was how a friend of mine described Joss Whedon's Firefly and Serenity to me a couple months ago before loaning me the DVD's.  And his description was pretty accurate, but it comes nowhere near doing this classic slice of pop culture justice.  While it's well known by now that Firefly was cancelled before its time, Serenity translates the genre-bending comedic action-sci-fi-western hybrid of the show to the cinematic medium, and brilliantly at that.  Serenity is a great movie by virtually any standard, but it's precisely great movies like this one (and Bubba Ho-Tep, and Shaun of the Dead, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, etc.) that are generally denied the recognition they deserve.  It's not flashy or pandering enough for mainstream appeal, and not pretentious or self-important enough for the Oscar crowd.  However, while it's not AN IMPORTANT MOVIE like Million Dollar Baby or Brokeback Mountain (neither of which I've seen, and I intend to keep it that way), Serenity is a fast-paced, funny, and beautifully-filmed watch whose economical dialogue and plentiful action make its two-hour running time feel more like one.<br /><br />Serenity manages to both pick up where Firefly left off and fill in some more of the backstory, continuing to follow the crew of the Serenity--tough-guy captain and former rebel officer Mal Reynolds; the husband-and-wife combo of devil-may-care pilot Hoban Washburn and no-nonsense first mate Zoe; brutish, self-interested warrior Jayne Cobb; cute, tomboyish mechanic Kaylee Frye; smoking-hot companion (aka high-class call girl) Inara Serra; and trauma surgeon Simon Tam and his psychic sister River--around the outer reaches of known space as they try to find work while steering clear of the fascistic Alliance authorities and cannibalistic Reavers.  One might think there would be some compromises to be made in bringing a beloved cult show to the big screen, but with Whedon on board as both writer and director, that's not a problem here.  The conversion to the new format provides Serenity with the nifty effects and grandiosity befitting its status as a modern space opera, but without compromising any of the wit, intimacy, and heart that made Firefly a great show (one might be tempted to note in passing that it was precisely these qualities that George Lucas's mega-budgeted Star Wars prequels largely lacked, but I won't).  The movie is somewhat darker, more violent, and more plot-oriented than the show, but it's all for a good cause, as Serenity goes a long way toward resolving several of Firefly's main plot strands, most notably the origins of the Reavers and River's importance to the Alliance.<br /><br />While it was already well-established that River was a tormented psychic super-genius, the movie reveals the true extent of her abilities early on when she cuts a deadly swath through the patrons of a crowded bar with some martial-arts moves that would make Bruce Lee blush.  It's no surprise, then, when the crew of the Serenity finds itself pursued by a sword-wielding operative dispatched to hunt down River and eliminate anyone in his way.  In the only major role created solely for the movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor (cool name) is creepily effective as the nameless operative, whose ruthlessly calculating demeanor and considerable skills in the deadly arts are matched by his singleminded, unreflecting devotion to his cause.  Ironically enough, the movie also sees Mal's wartime idealism, previously submerged beneath the hardnosed, me-and-mine-first pragmatism necessitated by his postwar career, starting to reemerge as the extent of the Alliance's perfidies comes into clearer focus.  I'll readily admit that I'm a sucker for plots that pit the little guys against the forces of an oppressive, faceless government, but even so Serenity's conception of heroism and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds should resonate with pretty much anybody.<br /><br />Even better,Serenity ends on a rather open note, leaving plenty of room for another installment.  Granted, this movie didn't exactly set the box office on fire, but given the brisk DVD sales anything's possible.  I for one wouldn't mind seeing another western-themed comedic space opera from Whedon, but in any case Serenity's classic status is guaranteed.  I for one found this to be easily one of the most intelligent, original, and entertaining movies of the decade.  5 stars for sure.n better, Serenity ends on a rather open note, leaving plenty of room for another installment.

B00005JOFO|5.0|One of the most moving and grace-filled works I've ever experienced in all the arts, this film is an astonishing masterpiece of beauty, truth and heartbreak. About love found, love lost, love endured, about how men-gay men are in reality and about how they do and don't deal with their feelings. In selfless performances of extraordinary depth, Heath Ledger's Ennis solidly anchors the film, while Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack illuminates it, with immense feeling and sensitivity. These men found a real home in each other, and their tenderness and mutual feeling, both expressed and unexpressed, is heart-rending in it's beauty. <br />Brokeback Mountain, to me, calls to mind the some of Kahlil Gibran's words about love: <br />\\"When love beckons to you, follow him, <br />Though his ways are hard and steep. <br />And when his wings enfold you yield to him, <br />Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. <br />And when he speaks to you believe in him, <br />Though his voice may shatter your dreams  <br />as the north wind lays waste the garden. <br />For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. <br />Even as he is for your growth so he is for your pruning. <br />Even as he ascends to your height and caresses <br />your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, <br />So shall he descend to your roots and shake them <br />in their clinging to the earth. <br />Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. <br />He threshes you to make you naked. <br />He sifts you to free you from your husks. <br />He grinds you to whiteness. <br />He kneads you until you are pliant; <br />And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, <br />that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast. <br />All these things shall love do unto you  <br />that you may know the secrets of your heart,  <br />and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. <br />But if in your fear you would seek only <br />love's peace and love's pleasure, <br />Then it is better for you thatyou cover your nakedness <br />and pass out of love's threshing floor, <br />Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, <br />but not all of your laughter, and weep, <br />but not all of your tears. <br />Love gives naught but itself <br />and takes naught but from itself. <br />Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; <br />For love is sufficient unto love. <br />When you love you should not say, <br />\\"God is in my heart,\\" but rather <br />\\"I am in the heart of God.\\" <br />And think not that you can direct the course of love, <br />for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. <br />Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. <br />But if you love and must needs have desires, <br />let these be your desires: <br />To melt and be like a running brook <br />that sings it's melody to the night. <br />To know the pain of too much tenderness. <br />To be wounded by your own understanding of love; <br />And to bleed willingly and joyfully. <br />To wake at dawn with a winged heart <br />and give thanks for another day of loving; <br />To rest an the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; <br />To return home at eventide with gratitude; <br />And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart <br />and a song of praise upon your lips.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Yes, great movie but dont get carried away this movie is not better than the godfather or casablanca. Plus Faye Dunaway is very ironic in real life not really a great person.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"WAKE UP PEOPLE if the critics were'nt blowing smoke up this films ASS...YOU'D ALL HATE IT....Prove me wrong....You only know their in love becasue the trailer and everyone tells you they are....THINK FOR YOURSELF....\\" <br /> <br />Hmmmmm...OK.  When I went to see this movie, I'd never seen a Heath Ledger film.  I'd seen Jake Gyllenhaal in \\"October Sky,\\" but didn't  make the connection until a couple days before I saw \\"BBM.\\"  Never seen an Ang Lee film, never heard of Annie Proulx, never read \\"Close Range.\\"  Never read a review of \\"BBM,\\" never saw a trailer.  Obviously I don't see many movies and I don't watch much TV.  The only thing I'd heard about it was that it was a \\"gay cowboy movie,\\" which really doesn't say much and isn't accurate anyway.   <br /> <br />I went into the theater with no real idea of what the movie was about and no preconceived notions, and yeah, I can think for myself just fine, thank you.  The movie blew me away.  I found it incredibly moving and haunting.  Gay or straight, man or woman, if you have ever experienced a loss, or known someone like either Ennis or Jack, this movie will go straight into your heart.

B00005JOFO|2.0|No doubt Ang Lee is a master of the \\"Tragedy\\".  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,(My Favorite) The Ice Storm and even The Hulk are all studies in human tragedy and sorrow. Ang is the best story-teller around who can actually make us \\"feel\\" for his protaganists.  All that being said this movie needs to be exposed for what it is, pure homosexual propoganda period which does double duty as a WMD aimed at demolishing masculine icons and imagery. Few serious students of sociology/philosophy/theology would disagree with the premise that masculinity is a threat to homosexuality & feminist ideaology and Ang Lee has been chosen to help lead the attack. (The American Cowboy Film?...of all the backgrounds to tell a story about homosexual love they choose THIS ONE?..not buying the \\"Coincidence\\" argument) <br /> <br /> I truly am amazed to watch Hollywood these days and even more amazed at how many people shrug their shoulders as they ignorantly stuff their face with this radical leftist propoganda as if its as normal as watching \\"Star Wars\\" or  \\"Rocky\\".  Really, Wake up people, Hollywood is frothing at the mouth, running around like penned crazed restless rabid zoo animals.  Every film coming out these days are attacking republicans, Current Presidential Administrations, capitalism, conservatives, traditionalists, christians (Islam & Buddhists are apparently Okay) white men, typical family structures, and anything currently associated with traditional american values. If it is NOT Counter-Culture then it DOES NOT PLAY. As a student of mass media it is amazing to watch. One only has to look at the Academy Award nominees this year as proof.  <br /> <br />In case you haven't noticed, Hollywood saved their best technical work for stories that promote the following messages, homosexual homewrecking masculinity killing cowboys, a manipulative self centered homosexual author manipulating doomed death row men for his own personal glory, mainstreaming transexuals, a film about \\"McCarthyism\\" and the \\"Noble\\" and \\"objective\\" intentions of the news media (Bwahahah), conspiracy films about collusions between THE EVVVUUULLLLL oil companies and Republican controlled governments, (Hey everyone..the world runs on Oil..its what provides us with energy and power...unfortuneatly we need it to live, I'm all for alternative energy but if we don't have it...people die) AND yet ANOTHER film about racism, and a film that asks hard questions about terrorism.  (Sorry folks MUNICH is the best film of the year period...Spielberg always gets ripped...Saving Private Ryan kicked Shakespere in Love) It is amazing that not too long ago this very \\"Academy\\" made the Catholic Apologist film \\"A Man for All Seasons\\" and the excellent \\"Chariots of Fire\\" best pictures films.  <br /> <br />Anyways, Brokeback has great cinematogrophy, a great score and good acting..its technically well made.  Its message is horrible.  Its not about \\"Love\\" a word most people do NOT UNDERSTAND in its many forms.  It is however about self centeredness, which maybe meets the lowest forms of \\"Eros\\" but neither the definitions of Philos or Agape. Most certainly, are obsession with the self is the current god most people worship in America. Regarding Homosexuality, it has been with us since the dawn of time.  Given that it was never accepted as a \\"Norm\\" in societies that actually lasted. One must seriously answer the question \\"why now\\"?  Is it because \\"Pop Culture\\" says so?  Are we enlightened beings because  Will and Grace has something meaningful, wise, and substantive to offer?  Why does approximately 1 to 2 percent of the population get so regularly represented in daily mass media consumption?  Its amazing thought to contemplate.   <br />Many self-titled \\"Open Minded\\" people practice reactionary labeling of people who disagree with the homosexual lifestyle as \\"Homophobic\\". This is pure Orwellian Thought and Speech Control. It also is a sign of somebody blanketly carrying the torch of somebody else's agenda...(Most likely pop cultures)  There are many hundreds of millions of people practicing religion who do not see homosexual lifestyles compatible with the doctrine of their beliefs. That reality is of equal relevance to the reality of homosexuality and deserves an equal amount of respect. Brokeback wants to mainstream homosexuality because of current pop culture trends.  Metaphorically speaking , if Hollywood and Brittney Spears is where we turn to get answers to life's questions we are in serious trouble.  Hopefully we can treat each other with respect whilst this experiment which was ignited in the sixities plays out until its bitter end. It will be interesting to watch Hollywood push their little agenda at the oscars...when Munich is the best film of the year.

Right now this album is still in stores and you need to buy this or else Joe Strummer will hunt you down for the rest of your lives. R.I.P. Joe Strummer. <br /> <br />P.S.- Forget bands like GOOD CHARLOTTE, BLINK 182, NEW FOUND GLORY, MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE, TAKING BACK SUNDAY, and FALL OUT BOY. they SUCK and they're POSERS, big time POSERS.

I don't know about the factuality of the information he presented on the Gov't agencies is but it is only a book.  I wish it had been about 200 pages longer cause I didn't stop reading when it was done.  If you like baldacci and  can accept the fact that it is a fiction novel...then this book for you.

B000065I0R|5.0|Anyone with a degree of wit will enjoy this film, though may question themselves for doing so, considering the dark content. <br /> <br />If you've read the novel, this is very much a lightened version, with gore exchanged for biting black humour, with most of the original hilarious Bateman quotes kept in. <br /> <br />The film centres around Patrick Bateman, a well-educated, self-obsessed 'yuppie' living in 1980s New York. Shallow Bateman feels little empathy with his fellow man, and even less for his fellow woman.  <br /> <br />Bateman is engaged to the lovely Evelyn(Reese Witherspoon) but is too busy listening to Robert Palmer on his walkman,drawing a corpse in crayon on a tablecloth in a very exclusive restaurant or \\"returning video tapes\\" to pay much attention to her. Their relationship typifies the 80s culture, summed up by Evelyn's \\"my friends are your friends\\" justification for their love-less association. Both are having affairs with each other's drug-addicted best friends. <br />  <br />Bateman's only friends(or associates) are his generic entourage of Wall Street colleagues, all sporting identical armani suits, versace sunglasses, crisp business cards, hairstyles and outlooks. Bateman, brilliantly captured in all his perfect clinical detail by Christian Bale, spends his days honing his physique with a mind-numbing exercise itinerary and facial-cleansing routine then 'trying to fit in' at his Father's accountancy firm Pearce & Pearce while scribbling pictures of the unfortunates he mutiliated the night before.  <br /> <br />At times the film becomes almost too surreal(FEED ME A STRAY CAT screams the hole in the wall machine), with the viewer never quite sure if Bateman really did murder a string of hookers, vagrants and various other victims or simply imagined the whole thing- his liberal use of cocaine, halcium and any other substance he can lay his hands on suggests the latter. Bateman and friends spend much of the film enjoying Cocaine-fuelled dry whiskey benders while being mistaken for other identikit businessmen and paying lip-service to world issues in Sri Lanka, the nuclear arms race and Apartheid. <br /> <br />Bateman's geeky love of 80s music characterised by his emotional critique of Genesis, Huey Lewis and Whitney Houston is very very funny, and I don't mind admitting despite his murderous leanings, I really enjoyed the character, and don't be suprised if you find yourself nodding along to some of his insanely bitter rants or laughing at his egotism and withering put-downs. <br /> <br />Make your own mind up whether Bateman's a murderer or just a fantasist, but be sure to see this film, and if you enjoy it, add the book to your haul too. <br /> <br />Brutally brilliant <br /> <br />Enjoy
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart concentrates on the effects of colonialism. His novel invokes the question of whether it is justified for one culture to impose their beliefs on another culture because they have a different set of morals and values. <br />Achebe's novel illustrates the response of an African tribe to the invasion by white Christian missionaries. The Ibo tribe has many problems deeply rooted in its culture. For one, the tribe is very sexist. The main character and the leader of the tribe, Okonkwo, holds a very high reverence for male dominance and his belief that \\"no matter how prosperous a man was, if he was unable to rule his women and his children (and especially his women) he was not really a man\\" (53). Okonkwo also has several wives in which he rules \\"with a heavy hand\\" (13). For Christians, polygamy is morally wrong. This is where Achebe asks the question of whether the missionaries' intent to change the tribe's culture is justified. It's a very difficult question to answer but in my opinion, Achebe seems to say no. At one point Uchendu says in response to Obierka, \\"the world has no end, and what is good among one people is an abomination with other. We have albinos among us. Do you not think that they have strayed from their way to a land where everybody is like them\\" (141). From this, I interpret that Achebe believes that there is no point in trying to conform every culture to be like your own because the world is so massive and so diverse that it would be impossible to convert everyone to one uniform culture and in attempting to do so, there will only be bloodshed. Although I found the novel to be slow at first, over time my respect for Achebe has increased as I find myself referring back to this question of humanity and where my beliefs side.
0743246616|1.0|I have been a professional cook now for about 8 years and I am maybe not the best baker in the world, but I do pretty good. After reading the reviews I decided to try this book for myself, I was looking for the Best Cupcake Recipe. Well I certainly DID NOT find it here (even though the front cover is cupcakes). The cupcakes were hard to swallow they were so heavy and oily and the icing almost made my teeth fall out. NO ONE liked them. I did find the best recipe (not from the book), but it took me 4 days and lots of trys, but I now have my own. I agree completely with the other negative reviews at least for the recipes that I tried.
078401213X|3.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this film.  It is all black and white and centers on a mathematician trying to find some mathematical solution to the stock market - it turns out corporate america and some Hassidic Jews are very interested in the solution he is nearing.  The story has promise, but it doesn't really develop very well and in the end I wasn't satisfied.  I don't think this movie is for everyone.
B00005JO1R|4.0|This movie was very good and the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon were wonderful.  My only critique is that Johnny Cash's actual life was even more dramatic than this film.  His addiction was much greater and took a lot more to kick than one drying out session at his house.  He went more than once to Betty Ford and fought his addiction most of his life.  I would have liked it to be a bit darker because that would be closer to reality.<br /><br />However, the movie was wonderful and I would definitely add it to my collection.  Joaquin Phoenix did a fabulous job.  He is totally believable as Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon is also wonderful as June Carter, but if I had to pick one \\"best performance\\" it would be Phoenix.
1400032717|5.0|This book was a very good and very quick read.  I picked it up on a whim, and was surprised to find that I couldn't put it down.  I was also surprised to learn that I, as someone who is interested in math and science, had a lot in common with Christopher, the autistic main character.  I think this is the books greatest strength--it presents autism in a unique new way that facilitates better understanding for those of us who haven't had a great deal of exposure to it. <br /> <br />Oh, and for the reviewer below who was perplexed that Christopher ranked days based on the number of red cars he saw in an odd order (4, 3, and 5 in ascending \\"goodness\\", rather than 3, 4, and 5)... 3 and 5 are prime numbers, just like every chapter number in Christopher's book.

I was watching the Osbournes one day and I saw Bert McCracken on their as Kellys boyfriend, haha thats gross. But then I went out and bought his CD so he kind of helped get his band out there by being on the Osbournes. Anyway, this CD absolutley amazed me. I was only 14 years old at the time and I havent really heard anything like it, it was so emotional and intense. I didnt stop listening to it for months and to this day I will still listen to it on occasion. I am so glad I bought this CD, and I hope you will buy it too if you havent already, every song is spectacular. The Used, who are from a Mormon area of Utah, made a very impressive debut album that is much better than their recent release.
B000000H6Y|3.0|This is basically run-of-the-mill 80s-style hair metal draped in black. If this turns you on, you'll probably go for goofy goth punks the Misfits or pompous dark lord Danzig if not Motley Crue, all of whom I consider to be less than stellar musicians. These reviewers sadly going on about how Type O Negative are these fantastic musicians clearly haven't been around the block far enough to hear some truly mind-blowing music. I suggest they take a clue from the back cover of BLOODY KISSES which reads: \\"Don't mistake lack of talent for genius.\\"<br /><br />Still, BLOODY KISSES definitely captures an appropriately doom & gloom atmosphere, mixing in creepy atmospherics and using suitably dark instruments (in this context at least) like organ and what sounds like a celeste. The album has a lot of variation and clearly they did put some hard work into it. \\"Kill All The White People\\" breaks out into old-school style speed metal while \\"Set Me On Fire\\" is essentially a shockingly upbeat pop song. Most of these songs tend to be slow and heavy though. The lyrics are often clever and amusingly silly, but tight-wad conservative Christians will be offended, so if yer one of those I suggest you go listen to Stryper.<br /><br />Sorry Type O fans, but most of this stuff is just too cheesy for my tastes. The gruff, meat-head/jock sing/shout-alongs (\\"Loving you was like loving the dead!!!\\") and the cow bell beats just about kill my ability to enjoy this CD. I do, however, love the deep, rich, undead-sounding voice of the lead singer.<br /><br />But the one song here I truly dig is the cover of the old Seals & Crofts tune, \\"Summer Breeze.\\" Giving that song a dreamy goth-metal tweak was a stroke of genius and TON pull it off beautifully - it's a freakin trip! It reminds me of another cheesy lite-metal band that I was never into at all although I absolutely loved their vamped-up and sleazed-out cover of Carly Simon's \\"You're So Vain\\" - the band? - Faster Pussycat. Oh yeah, I also like the in-between bits on BLOODY KISSES like \\"Dark Side of the Womb\\" which sounds like a baby getting aborted by a machine while \\"Machine Screw\\" sounds like a woman getting it on with, you guessed it, a machine. Once in a blue moon I'll check out \\"Christian Woman,\\" but the rest of this album I just don't think is very good, to be perfectly honest. To be generous though, I'll give it an extra point for \\"Summer Breeze\\" even though this is pretty much a two-star record in my book.DY KISSES like \\"Dark Side of the Womb\\" which sounds like a baby getting aborted by a machine while \\"Machine Screw\\" sounds like a woman getting it on with, you guessed it, a machine.

B00005JOWF|3.0|The first thing that struck me about \\"Ultraviolet\\" was just how stylized each frame of film was. This is due to more than just CGI; there's also a surreal quality to the characters, their skin a little too smooth and their complexions a little too vibrant to pass off as realistic. No question about it; it was fascinating to look at. And let's not forget the high tech shots of firearms and swords materializing from tiny devices worn on the assailants' wrists. That was fascinating to look at, as well. But as with a lot of big budget action flicks, this is a visually stunning piece that lags behind on story and dialogue, and for the general movie going population, it would only come off as a headache inducing music video.  <br /> <br />But for the comic book buffs and action film junkies, these are qualities that just might make their day. Made in the tradition of adrenaline pumping sci-fi films like the \\"Matrix\\" Trilogy (and even more so like the \\"Underworld\\" films), \\"Ultraviolet\\" is a perfect example of a film adapted from original comic book material: it's overwhelmingly frenetic, filled to the brim with highly choreographed fight sequences and completely saturated with futuristic details (including architecture, weapons, and costumes; one building is shaped like the biohazard symbol). Its energetic pace is enhanced by means of Klaus Badelt's throbbing score, an opus inspired by the hypnotic beats of techno clubs. At times I wondered why they even bothered trying to come up with a story; the battle scenes were entertaining enough, as was seeing Milla Jovovich in yet another superhero-type role. (And we all know she's not too bad looking; why else would a few seconds be reserved to show her exposed behind?). <br /> <br />But if you're hoping to experience a meaningful story with a cleverly disguised hidden message, then this is the wrong movie for you. Set in some distant yet unspecified future year, the movie begins with the voiceover narration of Violet (Milla Jovovich), saying, \\"I was born into a world you probably wouldn't understand.\\" She goes on to say that, in an attempt to eradicate a deadly viral infection, the government's scientists only managed to make it stronger. It then spread quickly, mutating countless numbers of civilians into a race of modernized vampires called Hemophanges, humanoids with superior skill and intelligence. Many of them are then taken away and exterminated (and this parallels history with disturbing accuracy). But a few survived, and they are the ones who fight back. <br /> <br />And it's a good thing, too. A militant government corporation led by the organized and seemingly germophobic Daxus (Nick Chinlund) has apparently developed a secret weapon meant to exterminate Hemophanges once and for all. Violet is sent to retrieve this weapon, and she painstakingly does so, going through scores of guards and security personnel with her lightening fast reflexes and razor sharp senses (along with a few well places slices of her machete-type blade).  <br /> <br />The initially straightforward plan unravels when she takes a peek inside the weapon case and discovers a human child. His name is Six (Cameron Bright), a quiet, somewhat melodramatic character that has been genetically modified. How and for what purpose is one of the mysteries of the story, which wouldn't have been so bad had a fewer number of twists and revelations been used. Everything we suspect about him is disregarded at one point or another, and after a while, it becomes exhausting trying to invest in an unknowable character. (And has Bright ever played a normal child? All he seems to be able to play are brooding, disturbed children, like in \\"Godsend,\\" and \\"Birth.\\") The only way to determine anything at all about him is to analyze his relationship with Violet. At first, she only sees him as a means to save her own life. But as the story progresses, she grows more and more attached to him. There is a specific reason for this, but telling you what it is would be giving too much away. Let's just say that her life experiences have left lasting impressions. <br /> <br />I think the biggest problem this film has is that certain things are just too unbelievable, even for a comic book. For one thing, Violet has the ability to defeat dozens of artillery and self-defense trained guards with minimal effort. You'd think this could be excused; remember that Hemophanges are physically superior to humans, and because of this, they should be able to take on any form of attack. Yet Daxus and his men are able to gun down Violet's comrades as easily as if they were swatting flies. Does this mean that somehow she's an even more superior being? I would have liked it if the film had answered this question, but since they didn't, all I can do is guess that it was for the sake of plot advancement. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the plot has so many holes in it that any form of advancement would be incoherent. Such a large chunk of necessary information is left in the dark, most of which is detail regarding Violet and the government (in other words; all the main characters). None of this is helped much by the amateurish dialogue: a blending of first-draft-quality one liners and fragmented attempts at voiceover summations. Granted, a lot of comic books are written like that, and if you enjoy reading them, then you'll probably find that \\"Ultraviolet\\" succeeds in every way. I'm sure the violence will keep many people cheering and hollering (even though this is a virtually gore free film). And the special effects are top notch; who cares whether or not they harm an already weak story instead of help it? Some don't care, and for them, this film will be waiting. For everyone else, it's best to just avoid it altogether.

B000B19BCG|5.0|Well its nice to see there is still music around thats not marketed to sell, that said, it would be nice if this album was marketed and actually promoted by the their record label a bit more instead of being shunned from the spotlight which it rightly deserves. <br /> <br />This is the best Supergrass album yet, and is a nice improvement over \\"Life on other planets\\" which seemed to be a bit lacking in focuss when it came to the songs. <br /> <br />This is an essential album. <br />
B000084T18|1.0|I think 50cent's 1st LP \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" is OVERRATED! And what was I thinking when I was about to buy his album. Goodthing that it was soldout or I would have been regreting it. Songs like \\"21 Question\\",\\"mini-man\\", and \\"in the club\\" got played out (in 2003). So this album to me represent him telling life or death stories. But on his 2nd album what was there to rap about. So this cornball had to go after MCs that's far more Better then him to save his rap career. But i got a question in the 21 Questions......Will 50cent be in the rap game 4 yrs from now?

B0000TLA9G|1.0|The best songs on this CD are the cover versions of songs written by other 'artists'...and while the original versions are great, the GnR takes on them suck.  They can't even do good songs by other people!  And Axl, please stop screeching...

0393307050|5.0|Master and Commander is the first book in the Jack Aubrey/Stephen Maturin Series, by the incredible Patrick O'Brian.  This book is so readable and realistic that you might want to consider wearing a weather-proof jacket, as you will feel as if you are on a Man-of-War right in the thick of the action.  Incredible scenes of battle and strategy.  The battle sections of the book are excellent, yet the relationship that Ship Surgeon Maturin develops with Captain Jack represents the key to this incredible story.  Another bonus is that you will learn a lot about the British Royal Navy and (battle) ships.<br /><br />This is great reading.  Don't miss out on this book!
B000BKVQTS|2.0|As a person who often enjoys horror stories its disappointing.  <br />There is nothing particular gripping in this story. The special effects are just okay as is the acting is on the poor side. <br /> <br />The story seems to owe almost nothing to the Brother's Grimm. The  <br />Brothers themselves seemed out of place, American style con men in occupied Germany. The French soldiers acted quite stupid.

B000BW7QWW|3.0|In science fiction, I think its important that you have a science  expert to go over the story for plausibility. If they had one here either he did not know what he was doing or they did not listen to him. <br /> <br />Overall the acting, the story and the special effects are very ordinary. Nothing really grabbed me about the story.  <br /> <br />If you like Westerns you might like it.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Charming to a fault \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" continues to be an enjoyable movie fifty years on. \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" tends not to be as valued as other Disney animated classics and that's because the story isn't larger than life like the whimsical fantasy of \\"Peter Pan\\" and lacks the fairytale charm of \\"Sleep Beauty\\" the two films released before and after \\"Tramp\\". Featuring a number of marvelous songs and vocal performances \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" continues to be a fun film that merely wants to entertain and it does that in spades.<br /><br /> We get a full screen presentation of the film and a widescreen version of the film. Why? Because Disney realizes that the kids will probably watch this on the second TV in the house on occasion. The colors are rich, bright and alive. This puppy is flea free as there aren't any analog or digital blemishes in this marvelous presentation. The film was originally presented in 3.0 \\"stereo\\" with a center channel for dialogue for theatrical presentation and that mix has been maintained on one track while Disney has offered an equally impressive 5.1 remix that sounds quite nice.<br /><br />The previous edition of this film looked terrific but was bare bones. This edition finally gives the movie its due. We get a second disc of marvelous extras including \\"Lady's Pedigree: The Making of Lady and the Tramp\\" which clocks in at nearly an hour going into everything from the casting to the design of the film and its evolution over time. \\"Storyboarding Featurette\\" gives animation fans a glimpse into the process and its importance to a finished feature. We also get to see storyboards produced for the film along with vintage audio discussing the story. Three excerpts from the \\"Disneyland\\" TV show that aired in the 50's highlighting the production of the film are included as well. We get to see performances by Peggy Lee performing a couple of songs from the film. Rounding things out we get deleted scenes some incomplete, an all new music video \\"Bella Notte\\" still galleries, games including a \\"Virtual Puppy\\" DVD-ROM feature not to dissimilar to the Nintendo game (none of which I've played of course and usually interest my children for about 10 minutes before they're off doing something else). Finally you can assess your own personality profile in \\"Your Inner Bark\\" and learn about real life breeds that inspired the characters in \\"Puppypedia\\".<br /><br />A terrific reissue from Disney \\"Lamp and the Tramp\\" is a worthwhile double dip. The original release didn't have anything in the way of extras and the audio and video receive flawless transfers.Bella Notte\\" still galleries, games including a \\"Virtual Puppy\\" DVD-ROM feature not to dissimilar to the Nintendo game (none of which I've played of course and usually interest my children for about 10 minutes before they're off doing something else).

B000B0QJM2|1.0|What a disappointment.  I thought that this DVD would be the concert version of the Made in Japan album (CD).  Instead, the first 35 minutes (of a 60 minute DVD) are a summary of all the albums of Deep Purple Mark II that lead up to the Made in Japan album.  When the four narrators finally get around to discussing the Made in Japan album, they use concert footage from previous concerts (filmed in the US, Germany, and elsewhere) to illustrate their point about a certain song.  The only Japanese footage included in this marginal DVD are a few cutaways of the Japanese crowd at a concert.  And we don't really know if this footage is from the Deep Purple concert!  Except for these few crowd shots, THERE IS NO CONCERT FOOTAGE OF DEEP PURPLE'S CONCERTS IN JAPAN ON THIS DVD.  I would have given this DVD zero stars, but there is no mechanism on this review in which to do so.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I don't know why people say that this movie was so bad. This was one of the better movies that I have seen. Some idiot said that the 1970's King Kong was better. It's better if it was trying to win the award for being the worst movie ever made. Listen to me folks if you buy this DVD you will not be disappointed. I'm sure you will think this movies is as good as the original!
B00005JOWF|1.0|Where do i begin? The plot is horrible and ridiculous. The acting is really bad. Much of the fighting scenes looks so cheesy. The cheap effects look very cheap. The set in much of the rooms look like something out of a cheap high school play. The only redeeming quality is that once in a while you see a cool special effect. Other than that....its definitely not something I would recommend. Save your money and watch something else.
B00006JIA4|5.0|When I bought this CD I was very impressed. Though some of the songs were a little fruity, I can respect the fact that that was the way they wanted it to sound. Over all I think it was a good CD set except for the 3rd CD. They could have just skipped that.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I loved this movie!  But I stress that it is not for everyone!  It is for a more open minded croud.  I see some horrible review's about this movie that are not actually about the movie but about the subject matter.  If you can't handle the subjects in the film, then you should not be watching it. <br /> <br />It was a good film, but there was room for improvement.  I saw the show on broadway and I understand why they had to cut some stuff from the movie...it would not have been as fluid.  I believe the standout performance in the film was Adam Pascal.  His voice is beautiful!  The funeral scene was hard to watch for his acting alone was breathtaking.   <br /> <br />Again I say that it is a good film for people with open minds...but if you are not open to people who are different then don't watch it.  If you are a person who is open to the way people are then this film is for you.  The music is fun.  The acting is great!   <br /> <br />It's wonderful seeing most of the origional broadway cast playing the roles that made them who thay are today.   <br /> <br />Thanks for reading and take care.
B000E97X66|5.0|Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band; Hammersmith Odeon London 75 <br />(Columbia) <br /> <br />It's hard to believe it's been 30 years since I was basically dragged out to see Bruce Springsteen on the Born To Run tour back in 1975. <br /> <br />Of course I had heard the album.  <br /> <br />I worked in a record store, and there was essentially no escaping Born To Run that year.  <br /> <br />It was everywhere. Rolling Stone was boldly proclaiming this guy as \\"the future of rock and roll\\". Similiarly bold pronouncements could be found in cover stories for both Time and Newsweek. The hype was absolutely enormous. And it was everywhere. <br /> <br />Personally, I thought the album was decent enough. Basically equal parts Dylan; Phil Spector; and Roy Orbison, the influences we're the right ones, and Born To Run had a cool \\"thoughtful street poet\\" sort of vibe to it...even if the cinematic scope of some of the songwriting was a bit, well \\"dramatic\\". <br /> <br />But a free ticket to see \\"the future of rock and roll\\" was still a no-brainer. <br /> <br />30 years (and some 31 Springsteen concerts I have seen since that life changing night in 1975) later, and I am still thanking my friend Jerry Fritzmann (God rest his soul) for that ticket.  <br /> <br />Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's performance that night not only did live up to all of the hype (no small task), it actually surpassed it. Not since I saw the Beatles on TV as a seven year old boy did a single rock and roll performance leave such a lasting impact on me. <br /> <br />Springsteen actually DID become the \\"rock and roll future\\" Rolling Stone had so boldly predicted, although it would be several years later before the public would fully catch up to the fact. <br /> <br />The highlight of last year's 30 year Born To Run commemorative boxed set released last year was the remarkable DVD of a complete 1975 show from London's Hammersmith Odeon.  <br /> <br />That same show has now been released as a 2 CD set, marking the first official release of a complete performance on CD from that pivotal period...where the E Street Band really cut it's teeth as a world class live band. <br /> <br />Springsteen himself has remarked often in interviews that he was not fond of the performance that night (he has since revised perspective in the liner notes of the BTR box).  <br /> <br />And on an initial listen here, during the first few songs, it's not hard to disagree with Bruce's original assessment.  <br /> <br />Bruce and the band sound somewhat tentative at first, as though all of the hype surrounding the arrival of the \\"future of rock and roll\\" in England was about to eat these good old Jersey boys alive. On future show-stoppers like \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\", the band seems to be rushing through it, lacking much of the \\"stagecraft\\" that they would hone to diamond like perfection on later tours.  <br /> <br />But about halfway through, something magic happens as the band begins to slowly find it's groove. Begining with \\"Shes The One\\", the band catches fire and you can start to see why they became arguably the best live band in the world.  <br /> <br />From there it never lets up. Bruce and The E Street band tear through frenetic versions of \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City\\" that hum along like...well, like a chrome wheel, fuel injected, last chance power drive. <br /> <br />Even when the tempo is slowed down for \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Jungleland\\", the band matches the dramatic ebbs and crescendos of those miniature street operas note for note. <br />  <br />By the time of \\"Kittys Back\\", the band takes off an an extended jazz improvisation with Roy Bittan attacking the ivories like a madman, as Max pounds away a backbeat that never loses a step. The Brits are then sent home Jersey House Party style with the closing trifecta of \\"Rosalita\\", \\"The Detroit Medley\\", and \\"Quarter To Three\\". <br /> <br />I've gotten a lot of flack from my friends over the years because of my \\"obsession\\" with Bruce Springsteen.  <br /> <br />And I have to admit I occasionally question my own sanity over things like travelling clear across the country just to catch one of his shows (which I've done more than once). <br /> <br />But rediscovering the Born To Run tour on this CD makes it crystal clear just what it was, and still is, about Springsteen that makes me believe in the promise of Thunder Road's \\"One Last Chance To Make it Real\\". <br /> <br />Did I mention I love Bruce Springsteen? <br />
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This is one of those extraordinary movies that will make you laugh, cry, bend your head and send tingles up your spine.<br /><br />Note: I give the special edition 4 stars for the lackluster \\"extras.\\" There are only a few and no interviews with the cast. And the commentary with the director and Kevin Smith was unfulfulling. They barely talked about the movie and often went off on tangents and would skip parts of the movie that I would have liked to hear some discussion on.
B000089CJI|5.0|I was given this CD as a result from an overflow of burnt CDs in a single collection. I happened to hear the song \\"Sleeping In\\" at one time but lost interest in trying to figure out who sang it. Once I put this in and listened to it I knew it was something special. It is a great CD, something unique and at the same time brilliantly done. Be sure to buy the \\"Wicker Park\\" soundtrack to get their single \\"Against All Odds\\". It is a wonderful remake of a Phil Collins classic. The CD I was given happened to have it as the first track and I am very happy it does. Support these guys on the great work they have done and treat yourself to a good CD.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I can't believe this movie. <br />The dialogues consist of endless one phrase pre-killing warnings, like \\"You just made the greatest error of your life\\", \\"You will regret it!\\" and so on, after which the actor/actress throws a \\"meaningful\\" dramatic look at the bleeding victim and pull out their big gun/sword/bazooka... <br />The women have of course their own bazookas stuck in their leather G-strings and their hair always has wind in it and they are really really badass. <br />Everyone's voice is low and dramatic and it becomes kind of monotone and makes you want to sleep, especially whith the movie being always so dark. <br />I found it terrible and predictable. But if you like computer games with women fighters you probably will enjoy this.
B0001LYH9S|4.0|OUTSIDE is one of the best yet also one of the hardest Bowie albums to listen to. It has its hits, but not many. This album was never meant to be a hit. It's an all-out concept album concerning occult-related  rituals, \\"art crimes\\", human dissection and many other unpleasant events. As Bowie himself said, it is a \\"Non-linear, gothic, drama, hyper-circle\\".<br /><br />The first thing you should know about this album is its length. Unlike some of his 70's albums that were often under 40-minutes (LODGER, for one), this hardcore-epic clocks in at over 75 minutes, and it is all on one disc. With that kind of time, it is blatantly obvious that not all of the tracks are going to be hits. But most of them do rock, and among the best are \\"Heart's Filthy Lesson,\\" \\"Hallo Spaceboy,\\" \\"No Control,\\" \\"I'm Deranged,\\" and \\"Strangers When We Meet.\\" All of these tracks rock, and the others that surround them (and sometimes bog them down) aren't too shabby themselves.<br /><br />Another reason to buy this disc is the intense and often disturbings booklet accompanying the album itself. After viewing some of the photos and reading the multiple diary entries by the concept-album's main character, Nathan Adler, it is obvious that Bowie is very interested in paintings and art (just check out the album's front cover that Bowie himself painted). Many of the photos in the booklet are surreal and often strange collages bordered by seemingly random text that offers some clues to the mystery which is the album's complex story.<br /><br />If you are curious about the album's over-all sound, the best way to describe it as is a \\"Jazz-influenced, gothic, industrial rock-epic\\". There are a few spoken word tracks on this album that contribute heavily  to the story, most notably \\"Segue- Baby Grace (A Horrid Cassette),\\" a particularly horrifying minute-and-a-half of some girl (Baby Grace Blue) talking about her wretched living conditions. During her abstract, distant descriptions that don't make a lot of sense but are still creepy as hell, jazzy music with eerie synthesizers play in the background. The song morphs right into \\"Hallo Spaceboy\\", which sounds a lot like all the other songs on the album. The bonus track, \\"Get Real,\\" is okay but not worth buying the album all over again.<br /><br />Over all, this album is one of Bowie's most artistic moments and also his best album since 1980's SCARY MONSTERS. I give it 4 stars (mainly because of the spoken-word-track's mediocrity), and the album is welcome in any industrial, Bowie, or simply eclectic music library.

B00001OH80|3.0|David Bowie's Tonight is not as bad as almost every critic makes it out to be. Yeah, sure, a few of the tracks suck horrendously  (\\"God Only Knows\\", anyone?), but what about \\"Blue Jean\\"? That's one of Bowie's best singles ever. But the one reason to buy this album is the first track: \\"Loving The Alien\\" . It  is one of my all-time favorite Bowie tracks and for a good reason: it is seven  minutes (that's a fifth of the whole album, just to let you know) of pure, other-worldly, David Bowie bliss .<br /><br />Another reason you may not want to pass this album up is the fact that Iggy Pop co-wrote a few of the tracks  on this album (in case you don't know, Pop was lead vocalist for the hard-hitting rock band The Stooges, who inspired Bowie's own Ziggy Stardust album immensely). Although the tracks he contributed to don't sound anything like The Stooges or his solo records, they still make for an interesting (yet poor) listen.<br /><br />If you're somewhere in-between a hard-core Bowie fan (me) and a serious Bowie listener, and if you don't want to buy all of his mediocre later albums (like Tonight), what I advise you to do is make a \\"best of the worst\\" of Bowie via iTunes or Napster. So, although you'd have his classics from the 70's, you'd also have his better later tracks all on one (or maybe two) convenient discs.<br /><br />Bottom line? Only the craziest of the crazy Bowie fans (such as myself) will find any reason to purchase this extremely short (and sometimes pathetic) Bowie album. I rate it 3 stars (what did you expect?). If you don't have his 70's albums, don't even touch this record. It may make you hate Bowie forever.
B000002UCN|4.0|This album has a great tracklist. Besides his Beatles classics (Something, Here Comes the Sun, While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Taxman, the fourth making its first appearance on a Beatles compilation) and a highly-underrated Beatles tune (Think For Yourself - chances are you hate it, but I've always liked the song), there's also some great solo stuff on here - My Sweet Lord, Give Me Love, Dark Horse and What is Life. But, similar to several other compilations, some great material is slighted. For one, what about his fine Beatles compositions Savoy Truffle and Piggies? And while I'm add it, I would've also like to have seen Wah-Wah and All Things Must Pass (the song that is). However, if you're a Beatles fan you should pick this up!
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Joe Strummer's Streetcore is one of the best albums ever. After a few rather poor recordings during the 90's, Strummer came back with this rock-masterpiece. It sounds as good as any of his efforts with the Clash or the 101er's. The sound of the album hits some risky area near rock and reggae, yet it couldn't be classified as either. It is something magical only Strummer could possibly conjure.<br /><br />Why, exactly, does this record rock so hard? The songs, of course. The album starts off  with a rollicking track titled \\"Coma Girl\\", and it is definitely one of Strummer's best moments. Exactly what he means by the rather bizarre lyrics he sings throughout the song is anybody's guess, but the music is pure, genre-clashing (excuse the unintentional pun, Clash-fans) excellence, and the whole album has only two slightly-mediocre tracks (even they aren't that bad, to be  honest). Those two are \\"Redemption Song\\" and \\"Silver and Gold\\". The first is a cover of the famous Bob Marley song, and although the second doesn't fit in with the rest of the CD, the lyrics on that particular track are chillingly prophetic, and therefore acceptable. Strummer sings, \\"I'm going to do everything silver and gold, and I got to hurry up before I grow too old,\\". It really makes you understand that Strummer knew that the end was near (Strummer tragically died shortly after the album's release).<br /><br />This album is timeless, and for Clash / Strummer fans everywhere, it is a strangely (yet strongly) emotional experience. It is essential in every Clash library, and even those who aren't huge Clash fans will appreciate its classic-rock sound. Finally, as a hard-core Clash / Strummer fan myself, I rate this album better then any Clash album except their self-titled debut and London Calling. It's the best album I've heard in years, and I don't think I could say enough nice things about it in a million years. An indescribable, modern, rock masterpiece (how so many Clash fans denied its existence upon its initial release is beyond mortal comprehension, in my opinion). I rate it a solid 5 stars. It's perfect.tence upon its initial release is beyond mortal comprehension, in my opinion). I rate it a solid 5 stars. It's perfect. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000148KK2|5.0|Many Diana Krall fans have come to appreciate her renditions of classic jazz standards. They may be disappointed because this CD contains unfamiliar, mostly original material by Diana (with Elvis Costello, her husband, collaborating on some songs). \\"Stop this world\\" Mose Allison, \\"Temptation\\" Tom Watts, \\"Black Crow\\" Joni Mitchell, \\"Almost Blue\\" Elvis Costello (1982) and \\"I'm pulling through\\"  are not by Diana and are also not that familiar. But after initial listening it grows on you and the more you play it the more you come to appreciate it. The lyrics, the combo backing, Diana's piano technique, and her phrasing with that incomparable voice all contribute to what I believe will come to be considered a classic. This is a fabulous collection of songs by one of the top female jazz singers today!
B00001OH7V|5.0|David Bowie and Brian Eno improved upon the already perfect 1977 album LOW with the ambitious HEROES. The album starts off with the legendary \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" and from that moment on it's obvious that this album defines Bowie's excursions in electronic, German-influenced music. It's the best Bowie album in the entire catalogue besides ZIGGY STARDUST, and one listen to each of the album's tracks is all it takes to realize this.<br /><br />First thing is first: breaking down the music into why it works and why it doesn't work is an essential building-block in any music reviewers process, and that is exactly where I'll start on this review. There is nothing on this album that doesn't work. Every song is perfect and sounds well-thought out, yet it still avoids that certain, distinct sound most classics have (you know, that sound where the artist sounds like he knows he's making a classic record?), and it sounds like it's perpetually stuck in the future. One may go as far to say that it's aged as well as (if not, much better then) ZIGGY has. Also, another reason HEROES works so well is that Bowie's vocals and lyrics seamlessly mesh together into a desperate growl, and unlike ZIGGY, where Bowie goes to the top of rock-stardom and then the bottom of heroin and cocaine addiction pitfalls, HEROES starts off in the pit of doom and gloom and then sort of climbs up towards sanity (the exact opposite of ZIGGY). Sure, the story isn't as fleshed out as ZIGGY's (some may even say there is no story on HEROES), but be honest. Who the hell understands ZIGGY's story, anyway?<br /><br />Although the music does take backseat to Bowie's screeching wails on some of the tracks, HEROES does include four instrumental tracks as LOW did before it, and they're all magnificent. In particular, \\"Sense of Doubt\\" is one of Bowie's best word-less tracks. Over some creepy background noises and ancient-sounding (that's a compliment, by the way) synthesizers, you can hear something moaning quietly, and then you can hear cars passing by. Despite the undeniable effort Bowie and Eno put into HEROES' instrumental songs, they aren't quite as good as those on LOW.<br /><br />Then, after a half-hour of being in Bowie's crazy world of surreal analogy's, drug-induced paranoia, and quiet yet creepy songs showing sings of ambiance and subtle distortion, Bowie, Eno, and Carlos Alomar bring the triumphant album to a mystifying, middle-eastern-inspired ending with the outstanding track \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\". This song is funkier then Bowie's own \\"Fame,\\" and it is one of his best moments.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this and LOW both tie as Bowie and Eno's best `Berlin Trilogy' albums. 5 stars, respectively. LODGER, eat your heart out.etly, and then you can hear cars passing by.

B00006AUIG|5.0|Friday the 13th always made me giggle; computer generated special effects bore me. If you are a fan of the old black and white Twilight Zones, early David Lynch films and like spooky abandoned Victorian buildings, you're in for a scary treat! Next, add a cast that seems made for their roles and you're in (a good scary movie kind of) hell.<br /><br />Each character is a mix of bravado and vulnerability.  David Caruso keeps you guessing. Peter Mullan is brilliant as the desperate man with marital problems. Josh Lucas with his electric eyes, smirks and tattoos (in the film) are perfect for mischief making and going to places you don't want to visit. Stephen Gevedon is calm with an underlying darkness that gently envelopes you into its lair. Brendan Sexton III is strangely charming as the mouthy mullet head kid with little boy fears. Although we've seen the line \\"F--- you!\\" delivered in too many movies to count, David Caruso, with those eyes and finger pointing, makes it new and unforgettable.<br /><br />Sounds are also very important in this film. The occasional music makes use of the Beatles \\"Number Nine\\" variety with its backwards notes. A boom box that might add some cheer to a large echoy room is turned off since it might unhinge particles that \\"go into your lungs and create little time bombs\\" (I don't recall the exact line). A cell phone ends up disconnecting characters from themselves. The old tape player of Mary Hobbe's sessions helps bring a sense of going back in time to when it was originally recorded. Dripping water from leaky ceilings and bumps in the night are used sparingly. There are no cheap tricks in this film. Every detail is a set up for the grand unraveling.<br /><br />The imagination can generate horror far better than any special effects. You'll love the way this film coaxes you into a world of madness that you can almost understand. Now that is scary.<br /><br />The DVD has cut scenes and an alternative ending that you should not miss.
B000002IZM|5.0|I am nowhere near worthy enough to write a review for Vangelis' masterpiece, but I will do my best to write a comprehensible review for this album.<br /><br />Let's start with the minor quibbles about the album. The most common complaint you've probably heard about this splendid soundtrack is the inclusion of voice excerpts from the film in some of the tracks. Despite what you may have heard, the SoundBits from the film actually add a fair amount to the album (particularly \\"Blush Response,\\" \\"Wait For Me,\\" and \\"Tears In Rain,\\"). The only track where the voices seem to be out of place is on \\"Main Titles\\" where you hear Deckard (Harrison Ford's character) speaking about the exact amount of zooming he wants a machine to perform (it's cool in the film but weird on the album, especially to Blade-Runner-virgins who haven't seen the film, although I doubt anyone who buys and listens to the soundtrack hasn't seen the movie a million times like I have).<br /><br />The only other minor annoyance on the album is the entirely out-of-place track \\"One More Kiss, Dear\\". It isn't electronic or ambient-sounding music like the rest of the album. It's some sort of bizarre, pre-doo-wop song that was played in the movie briefly, and I'm 99% sure that  Vangelis didn't compose it. Even more unfortunate than having it on the album is the fact that it's stuck right smack-dab in the middle of the entire album (for some, it may ruin the entire experience). Whoever decided to do that should be ashamed of themselves. However, it is just one track, and anyone who isn't paralyzed can simply press a button to skip over it.<br /><br />Petty bickering aside, there are many more things to love about the album then to hate. For starters, it is revolutionary. No film soundtrack sounded that distant yet so near, and Vangelis improves upon the original film score by including many pieces he originally  withheld from the theatrical-version of the movie and the largely-improved Director's Cut. The best of these is definitely  \\"Blush Response\\" (possibly the best song on the album besides the legendary and often copied/ remixed \\"Blade Runner End Titles\\").<br /><br />Anyone who listens to this album will agree that it has some sort of eerie while fascinating sound to it, and words are vastly unable and incompetent at describing it. Words like \\"haunting\\" and \\"lingering\\" are often thrown around quite casually when it comes to discussing this album, but I think \\" an overall impending sense of tragic doom and artificial beauty\\" describes it much better. Also, anybody  who simply dismisses this album as good \\"background music\\" is mistaken. The album is great to listen to anytime anywhere.<br /><br />I have a funny feeling that anyone who has read this far into my review probably already owns the album, but if you don't, you should purchase it immediately (it's pretty cheap here at amazon.com, too). I rate it 5 stars, although it is not for everyone.t of these is definitely  \\"Blush Response\\" (possibly the best song on the album besides the legendary and often copied/ remixed \\"Blade Runner End Titles\\"). <br /> <br />Anyone who listens to this album will agree that it has some sort of eerie while fascinating sound to it, and words are vastly unable and incompetent at describing it.

B000A6T1KE|2.0|I'm a Star Trek fan, and of all the movies, this one is the only one that really HAD to be hyped.  Even the Star Trek movies that aren't the greatest (traditionally, the odd numbered ones) have some merit to them.  This movie, is horrid, with it's contrived sequences, that propel it's story to...more contrived sequences.  This movie is the reason why Star Trek had to take a break, not the last show, because it was getting a whole lot better, story wise than some of the other series.  this movie killed Star Trek...I blame Rick Berman.
B000002MJ0|4.0|My Bloody Valentine's Isn't Anything isn't perfect. Although it is slightly more influential (in my opinion) then their moment of excellence, Loveless, it isn't as good. In some ways, it is much easier to listen to Isn't Anything if you forget about Loveless entirely. Then, you can appreciate the album for all it is: a near-perfect example of seamless distortion and faded yet sensual voices provided by Kevin Shields and Bilinda Butcher (unfortunately, unlike Loveless, Shields takes the spotlight on this album, and Butcher sings on only a few of the tracks).<br /><br />Isn't Anything is much simpler then Loveless. Although it doesn't directly sound like it was influenced by the Ramone's self titles debut, I can't help but feel the connection. Maybe it's how the album is so short and still lingers in your thoughts long after the initial listen very much like the Ramone's first album did (and still does). Or, possibly, it's because the songs sound simple yet are complex. For example, they repeat things often as the Ramones did, and the guitars, although sounding very different, play the same chords over and over again.<br /><br />Two other heavy influences  My Bloody Valentine's Isn't Anything seems to display are David Bowie (slightly) and Joy Division (heavily). The only way Valentine was influenced by Bowie is how a lot of the track's lyrics seem to be optimistic in a depressing area or vice-versa. The Joy Division influence is blatant. On the track \\"No More Sorry,\\" one can't help but be reminded by Joy's \\"New Dawn Fades\\". The lyrics are desperate cries to someone who will listen, and they often deal with serious issues (suicide, chronic depression, severe loneliness, and over all pessimism). That's where this album improves over Loveless: you can actually hear what they're saying, and whether it's sensual allegory's (\\"Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)\\"), suicide (\\"Sueisfine\\"), or basic desires (\\"All I Need\\"), it's always easily comprehensible and usually listener-friendly. Joy Division, however, sang seriously when it came to serious topics. The Valentine's don't: on \\"Sueisfine\\", the chorus changes from \\"sue is fine\\" to \\"suicide,\\" yet the music and the tone of the singer (Shields) is disturbingly upbeat.<br /><br />A few of the tracks on this album feel like they were tacked on with a limp nail. One of these include \\"All I Need\\". It's an unnecessary addition that doesn't contribute anything to the over all feel of the album (it's melody is particularly horrendous compared to other gems on the album like \\"You Never Should\\" or \\"No More Sorry\\").<br /><br />The final verdict is that, while listening to this album, I wanted to listen to who influenced the album more. But, even more so then the Valentine's influences, I wanted to listen to Loveless the most. I give Isn't Anything 4 stars, because without it, there may have never been Loveless.friendly.

B00005JO9J|5.0|I've already watched all nine episodes twice and some episodes three times and I'm already screaming for more.  I want season two already.  After looking at another web site season two is about 22 episodes so I'm sure we will be paying 2 to 3 times more for the next DVD release. I would like to see the next set with some out takes so we can see our favorite characters when they are not acting. I can't wait!!!!!!!!
B00029NMRW|5.0|This is an extremely unusual film in that it is better than the first one - nine yards- which was very good. It has only one disadvantage : you may need, or rather I needed to view it twice to understand what was going on. Not a real disadvantage - I just viewed it for the third time and enjoyed it even more.
B0000214F0|2.0|Not for everyone.   It was as expected, but I was disappointed in the acting.  McDowell, Geilgud and OToole are good, but I've seen them do better.  Perhaps it was the story line, but I thought it to be boring.  Got more out of the series on PBS in I, Claudius.
0553208845|3.0|This is a classic retelling of the life of The Buddha- the original one.  There are other- many other- versions out there.<br /><br />I have always found this treatment to be the most emotionally exhausting version around.  That has always seemed terribly inconsistant to me!  The Buddha is one of, if not the most, inspiring being to grace our planet.  There are the basic facts, but those events lead him to enlightenment- shouldn't a treatment of his life should reflect that?  This was one of the earliest versions available to the western audience.<br /><br />In my opinion, that is why it has become a classic; however, there are many versions available today through many of them through various Buddhist orders.  I would strongly suggest someone new to Buddhism try one of them instead!

Yes I loved the movie, and love the way he makes movies.but just rent it for now.if u never seen it. But if u DVD collector like I am..Better an wait then sorry!
B0002S947K|4.0|This album by Lamontagne will take you to a relaxing place where you can just kick back in the rocking chair, grab a cold beer, and wind down from a long day. His acoustic riffs and Van Morrison meets Otis Redding and Ray Chales sound illuminate throughout the album, accented significantly in the tracks \\"Hannah\\" and \\"Shelter\\"  This album is for the acoustic sound lover, and you will be hooked instantly by the opening track, \\"Trouble\\". A must have indeed for the true acoustic enthusiast and pure vocalist fan. Genius.
B000E97X66|2.0|The DVD is mesmerizing.  The flip-side should have been this CD.  Unfortunately, after paying $23 for this double CD, I was greatly disapointed.  The sound quality simply is not very good, and Bruce is not not very smart.  I should have saved my money, so I could pay $100 to see him live.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|If I were to introduce a friend to the sound of the 70s punk scene i would probably show him the first disk to my essential clash collection,aka basically the first two albums of the clash's career. However, if I were to introduce someone to just the Clash, purely focusiong on the band itself, I would deffinetely start here. This is undoubtable the single most recognizable album of their career. I mean personally I honestly can't say this is my favorite album but it's a very good one at least and it would only rank behind their self titled album, and Give Em Enough Rope. An awesome album in not Punk Rock history but history of Rock N Roll. I think it deserves 5 stars at least.
6305128952|5.0|To say that this movie is about the relationship between a little girl and her horse is a gross understatement. For the beautiful screen adaptation of Nicholas Evans' novel under Robert Redford's master direction is a soothing canticle for the spirit. A song of hope, that touches our hearts, as the minuscule and almost unnoticeable drop of rain does when kissing a flower's petal by the dying shadows of sunrise. This is a story that says that love is everpresent patience, particularly in those times when the object of our affection seems to be distant, or even lost. It is about falling into the dark abyss of hopelessness when we realize that for whatever reasons perhaps we have been taking for granted the very things that in the end, are the ones that keep us breathing. Or even learning, that sometimes we have to let go of certain things, for others to stay and blossom.     Grace Mc Lean (a very young Scarlett Johansson) has a terrible accident while riding her horse Pilgrim. As a result, Grace's best friend dies, and both Grace and Pilgrim are left with terrible physical and emotional injuries to endure. The terrible circumstances in which the McLeans are caught up into, begin to uncover the many cracks and emotional holes existing in the relationship between Robert and Annie (Grace's parents) most of them masterfully hidden under years of routine and probably under a comfortable carelessness. After the accident, young Grace starts to slide down into an abyss of emotional bitterness and frustration which is  endangering both her soul and spirit.     A confused Annie, will cling on to the hope that Pilgrim's recovery may also probably be a way to Grace's emotional healing, so she starts to research into the somewhat seclusive world of horses, finding out about Tom Booker (Robert Redford) a renowned \\"horse whisperer\\" with a special touch for troubled animals who lives out in the prairies of Montana. In a desperate move she sets out to the country to find Booker, alongwith a reluctant Grace and the sick horse in a trailer. During this trip to the unexpected, Annie will find herself confronting the harshness of her own frustrations and failures as a distant mother, perhaps more involved with her career than with her family, and also with the overwhelming sadness of a marriage and a love once new that, though still there, has now grown old and empty.     A shaken and vulnerable Annie and a lost and hurt Grace, will ultimately end up finding strength and purpose in Tom Booker's devotional dedication to Pilgrim's recovery. Somehow it seems that by -patiently yet strongly- taming Pilgrim and his scarred soul, Booker is taming his own spirit as well as Grace's and Annie's, so they all can come to accept those things they cannot change, while being brave enough to change those they can. The overwhelming presence of nature and the vast landscape will also make them discover the joy hidden in simple things as the blessings we all enjoy just merely for being alive. Eventually a love story unfolds between Annie and Tom but despite the strong feelings for each other, they realize that their coming together would eventually require them to sacrifice too much, so even loving each other, they ultimately choose to let each other go. In time, Pilgrim's progresses mean acceptance and fortitude and an unexpected maturity for the young Grace who slowly begins to overcome her tragedy with acceptance and courage. Ultimately she finds herself in peace with the burden that has been put over her young shoulders. When Annie, Grace and Pilgrim set back to NY they will physically seem to be returning back to their old lives, but is just obvious, that all of their lives have been changed forever. So they are not really returning, but beginning to travel a path to someplace totally new.     The scenery, the marvelous natural landscapes, the photography are just spectacular. Simply beyond words. The music provides a perfect background to the movie and the original soundtrack by Thomas Newman including moving pieces like \\"The vast continent\\", \\"Angus\\", \\"Your misfortune -none of my own\\", \\"Pilgrim's progress\\"... is out of this world, being one of my favorites ever and by far one of the most beautiful scores I have ever listened. A special mention has to be made of Robert Redford, whose job as a director was (from my humble point of view) totally overlooked and underestimated by the Oscars. Being the beautiful movie that this is, I will never understand how the Academy ignored it so dramatically in all Oscar categories.
1563523302|5.0|This well-researched book shatters the myth that your typical millionaire lives in a ritzy neighborhood, drives a swanky car, and wears designer clothing while drinking expensive champagne.  As you can read in the book, most millionaire families are headed by entrepreneurs who have worked hard and wisely invested their money.  The \\"average\\" millionaire shops for clothes at J.C. Penney and wears a Timex watch.  If you saw a millionaire in a store or a restaurant, you could not even tell that he or she was a millionaire.  I especially liked the last part of the book where the authors have a chart showing how much every car costs per pound.  My only complaint:  the authors do not tell you how to become a millionaire, other than don't spend more than you have to.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Director Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society) had against him that \\"Master and Commmander: The Far Side of the World\\" was released the same year that the world was still processing the unfolding marvel of Peter Jackson's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Had it been otherwise, \\"Master and Commander\\" would have probably caught much more of the Academy's attention as the truly great film it is. In my opinion, one of the best movies ever.     For many connaiuseurs this may be the best-looking film ever made about naval warfare. It is an adaptation of many of the adventures and characters narrated by Patrick O'Brien in his series of naval novels written in the 20th century. Naval experts agree that filmmakers carefully researched ships of this particular historic period and paid extreme attention to naval details, historic settings and naval jargon.     The story is simply captivating: it is August 1805 and the Napoleonic Wars are at its best. The HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is stationed off the east coast of Brazil with the mission of stopping the French privateer Acheron. After a first engagement which ends in a near disaster for the Surprise; the French ship escapes.  Thereafter, a chase begins, with the Surprise pursuing the Acheron south through the Atlantic Ocean, around Cape Horn, and through the Pacific to the Galapagos Islands.     Underneath the main story line, lies the close and honest friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor (marvelously portrayed by Paul Bettany). If you happen to like the movie I would also very strongly recommend to buy the film's soundtrack. It is a delightful and captivating selection of pieces handpicked to match the greatness of the story. I myself cannot help but to hear in my mind the beautiful notes of Boccherini's \\"La musica notturna delle strade di Madrid\\" while revisiting the beautiful sea landscapes, breathtaking scenery and spectacular photography of this excellent movie.     Simply brilliant!
0887306101|5.0|This book (and its sister book The New Market Wizards) are two of the best books on trading ever.  No other book does so much to put the reader into the mind of a trader.  To me, the most amazing thing about the traders interviewed was the multiplicity of techniques; one ignores technicals, another lives and dies solely on technical analysis; some trade on the floor, others from the comfort of their home.  If you want to become a great trader, red and re-read and re-read these two books!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|A sci-fi, horror classic for the ages, Jaws is the first of many Steven Spielberg movies that rank as blockbusters. It has a musical score unlike any other (especially the opening sequence) by John Williams. Jaws stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss with co-stars Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton. For those that haven't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to do so. It is one of the top 100 movies of all time.
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|This is a wonderful ADAPTATION of the story of Darcy and Lizzy, very well made with beautiful music, scenery and artsy segues. I would recommend anyone unfamiliar with this story to NOT watch this movie first. It is a nice, bite size version that can best be appreciated when watched with a prior understanding of the characters and the story (as it hacks the actual story to pieces). First, of course, see the '95 version (and read the book!).<br /><br />My praise: Artsy, artsy, artsy! If you listen to the commentary, the director really knew the story and was NOT trying to blatantly follow the book (as we all know, that has been done with perfection, so why try?). He was trying to bring fresh thought and feeling to it and, though I don't agree with a lot of the re-writing of the lines, I applaud the way he alluded to the windows being a metaphor for perception, the way the sunrise opened and closed the story, the setting being 100 years prior to the actual setting of the book, the domestic abuse of Lydia by Wickham (which we all suspected), the little character nuances and sub-plots that took place in the background of every scene (you gotta be quick!), and the romance he could achieve with scenery and music, when no action was taking place. Oo! Simply beautiful! So much more than simply telling the same old tale! And the first-proposal scene! Nice!<br /><br />My rant: I felt this version blew thru the actual story perhaps a little too fast. Much of the wit for which Jane Austen is so well known is NOT done justice. Lines from the book which ARE left intact are spewed with little thought or acting, especially in the beginning. Sometimes so fast that, if I wasn't familiar with the dialogue, I would've had no idea what was going on. And character development? What's that?<br /><br />I was not infatuated with Knightley as Miss Lizzy. She lacked the playfulness and intrigue of her character. She had some of the best lines, yet constantly disappointed me in their delivery. Plus, she always looked disheveled and sticky to the touch. And the teeth on Mr. Bennet! Such pearly, straight choppers for a poor man in 1790! They are blinding amidst all the gloom. C'mon makeup guy, try a little harder!<br /><br />However, Macfadyen was wonderful as Darcy and I wish he had more scenes to better explain his character. I feel he could've done it justice. And Lady Catherine? Perfection!<br /><br />I really expected this to throw out ALL the wit and plot and turn this into some sickly, thin love story that would appeal to idiots everywhere (the 2 hours run time scared me). However, it did not. Some wit remained, all the high points were addressed and there was many a scene where Knightley and Macfadyen had fantastic chemistry. In the end, though, it just wasn't there for me. A little cheesy/sappy perhaps.<br /><br />My ideal P&P would be somewhere between this and the '95 one. I LOVE the romantic artsy-ness this one brings to the table, yet the '95 version is faultless in it's story. Oh well, maybe the next version will be better.<br /><br />Should you buy this one? Of course! A new take on a great story is always appreciated! However, I would recommend the WS version, as the director has a lot of shots with characters on extreme R and L, and they are uncomfortably close to the edges of the screen on the FS version. Plus, WS will do the beautiful, sweeping wide-angle scenery better justice.disheveled and sticky to the touch. And the teeth on Mr. Bennet! Such pearly, straight choppers for a poor man in 1790!

B0009UC810|5.0|John Belushi (Jake) and Dan Aykroyd (Elwood) are the Blues Brothers, period. This is one of the top comedies of all time and one of the best soundtracks ever. An outrageously wacky and just plain feel good movie. Other stars include James Brown, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, John Candy, Henry Gibson, Carrie Fisher and Steve Lawrence. If you haven't seen this movie and like comedy and music, it is a must own. The Penguin highly recommends it!!
B000BTJDG2|5.0|I haven't seen a more realistic moive of this kind in a long time. The moive really opens a lot of doors and I think it was handled real well.<br /><br />The moive is about Father Moore being put on trial for neglect of Emily during an exorcism. The question being raised is was Emily truly possesed or did she have a medical condition. I can't say for sure what I believe but I know there was something wrong with her and I think Father Moore isn't to blame.<br /><br />I hope that the people watching this movie will do so with an open mind and take in what is said.<br /><br />Penny Lane
B000000OQF|5.0|As a music collector I am compelled to tell everyone who loves metal and hard classic rock to buy this CD because it is one of the best ever. Axl and Slash shine. \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" is G N' Rs best work.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I loved this movie to death. It really had me wanting to cry at times, laugh at times, and scream at times and that to me defines the perfect movie.<br /><br />In the movie Katherine Watson (Roberts) comes to teach at Wellesley College for girls and brings with her a liberal prospective on female rights. When she starts teaching the girls that their standards of being a housewife are wrong she faces some harsh comments mainly from Betty Jones (Dunst) but she also finds acceptance with some of the girls. At the end it finally has some sort of resoultion to the Katherine and Betty fued because Betty realizes she has more potential than what she thought.<br /><br />I liked the way we got to see bits and pieces of the girls lives but mainly Katherine's because that made you feel all the more connected to the girls. If you want a movie that will make you feel happy to be a woman now days this is it.<br /><br />Penny Lane
1878424319|5.0|A great book for anyone who considers themself \\"spiritual but not religious.\\" Of course, these guidelines will work well with any religion since it addresses how to live your daily life with integrity, honesty, peacefulness, and love. The writing itself is simple and easy to understand; the text is easy on the eyes and not \\"dense.\\" A great book to keep by the side of your bed -- unless you find yourself loaning it to friends as I do.  :-)
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd's first real, through-and-through good album, without the eyebrow-raising hippie stories or questionable folk guitar. The music on here is beautiful, dramatic but understated in a confident way; good background music, but also good music to chill out and jam to on the headphones. <br /> <br />From a Floyd newb listening to everything in order, this is the first stroke of genius I've come across so far in PF's catalogue.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I was given this DVD/CD for my birthday recently and have been listening to it constantly for the past two months. I cannot imagine not liking this mans voice or his charismatic personality. He is quite simply one of the freshest entertainers out there. He somehow manages to take standards  that have been around forever and breath new life into them putting his personal twist on them. Last night I was lucky enough to see him live and I am still levitating! It was as if the DVD came to life right before my eyes! The band is amazing, the quality of vocals was even superior to his CD's. I am shocked that he sounds even better in person. The true test of his talent was the moment he put his microphone down and sang without the band or the mike. He projected that gorgeous,smooth silky voice throughout radio city music hall with no amplification whatsoever. Can you tell I'm in love? If you like mood music and being transported to another place and time, do yourself a favor and run to buy this gem. 'Nuff said.
B000BJS4TO|4.0|This CD has beautiful arrangements and it is so lovely to listen to! I listen to it at work (office environment) and it provides beautiful background music. Would also be great for relaxation at home. Of course John Williams always delivers. I hope he gets the Oscar for this one! The movie was great but the music is even more outstanding. His Japanese influenced sound would be appealing to anyone's ear. If you love classical music or simply love movie tunes, don't pass this one up!

But it's not being released until Basic Instinct 2 comes out.<br /><br />This version doesn't have the essay by Camille Paglia. How many version do I have to buy.  And studios wonder why profits are down.  Thank goodness for bittorrent.
B00000ILDE|5.0|I'm not sure why anyone would not like the first Alien film better. It is more atmospheric and mysterious and really sets the tone for the series. Aliens is an exciting, more action packed, thrill ride, and it is really fun to watch.<br /><br />I wish Bishop could have had more lines... he is an interesting character and what a great actor. The little girl in the film could have really ruined the whole picture, but she never has any \\"Gerorege Lucas stupid funny kid\\" lines, so she actually adds a lot to the storyline and gives Ripley a reason for some of her actions. The last 35 minutes of the film is the best part and is done amazingly well special effects wise. The special effects in this film are almost all practical effects (not cgi) and they look completely believable! An excellent sequel, but, still, the first film is definitely the best in the series.
B00005JOIF|5.0|Munich, directed by Stephen Spielberg, is a tale of revenge--its appeal and its final lunacy. It tells the story of the tragic kidnapping/murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, Germany, and then focuses on the team of Mossad (Israeli secret police) agents who are selected to assassinate Black Septemberist functionaries (the group responsible for Munich) in retribution. <br /> <br />The movie is searing, brutal and difficult to watch. Among Spielberg's work, it has the same sense of uncompromising reality as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Technically, this film is well put-together. The acting is strong throughout. The film itself reminds one of a 70's movie, with gritty footage and muted colors. It is appropriate to the subject. Thematically, this movie shows the horrible reality of dreamed-about revenge; how politicians, from on high, make decisions over tea about how we have to \\"show people we're strong,\\" but how those decisions eventually translate into the ruin of people's lives, some of whom are innocent and some guilty, but always complex. Munich begins by showing us the Munich tragedy, and the audience immediately wants the terrorists responsible to pay. But, by showing us the actual mechanisims of the Israeli revenge (and suggesting that their revenge will simply lead to more Palestinian retribution, which we now know it did), we start to repent of our desire for that revenge. Also, awful though the thought may be, we gain some possible insight into the original Munich terrorists, and even, perhaps, a little sympathy. <br /> <br />This is not Spielberg's finest film, but it is great. Great and heavy and not something I think I will want to watch a second time, because it is just that hard. It is essential viewing once, however, because the historical content and themes are important, present and not likely to leave us any time soon.
B000E1155E|5.0|Everyone already knows that the Arctic Monkeys are the most heralded band in England since Oasis.  They got huge before ever releasing an album, but Oasis had Definetley Maybe (which is stellar) and what did the Arctic Monkeys have?  I was prepared to think that these guys were just hype created by the hyperbolic British press, but I was willing to give them a chance, and I am so pleased that I did. <br />I was having a conversation with one of my friends and he said that every new Brit-group is one part Oasis and one part something else (but this is not really true, they can sometimes be one part Blur like the Kaiser Chiefs or one part Radiohead like Coldplay and Muse), but the Monkeys seem to mix the catchiness of Oasis with the schitzophrenia and riffery of System of a Down.  Perhaps it's fitting that they are cracking both the British and American markets: they are heavily influenced by the biggest bands of each respective side of the pond.  However, the Monkeys have crafted a very unique sound.  it fits in with other modern indie bands like Franz Ferdinand, but it is more aggressive and sounds more real.  \\"I bet that you look good on the dancefloor\\" is a great first single, \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" is destined to be on radio for ages, and virtually every song stands out from one another.  Perhaps the highlight of this album is the finale \\"A Certain Romance\\" with it's beauty mixed with sheer rock.  I really just can't stop listening to this album, and the lyrics are getting stuck in my head. <br />Arctic Monkeys may very well be Britains second comming of Oasis.  Even their booklet and single sleeves are virtually the same style as those of early Oasis.  Hopefully they will have their Morning Glory and conquer the world.  I think they deserve it, and I was ready for them to be nothing more than hype when I heard this album.   <br />So is British music on the rise again?  It certainly appears to be so.  The Subways, Kaiser Chiefs, Muse, and Coldplay have all broken the American airwaves, and now Oasis has come back with the fantastic Don't Believe the Truth (probably the best British album since...Morning Glory).  The Arctic Monkeys are now launching to the top of the list with Oasis and Coldplay, and if they can follow up with a good sophomore effort, they'll be around for years like those two.
0812550757|4.0|It is extremely important to note that I read this book (and am writing this review) as a fierce lover of Ender's Game, and one who has reread the title a number of times since first picking it nearly twelve years ago. This may be unfair, but it's also likely to be true for most people's experiences. I held off picking up the sequels because I didn't want my enjoyment of Ender's Game to be tarnished by what I feared would be the attempt to continue what was a perfect story on its own; I've seen too many great stories ruined by \\"sequel-itis.\\" Finally, at the pleading of someone whose literary taste I respect greatly, I gave in and picked up Speaker, the first of a line of sequels about the Enderverse.<br /><br />Speaker for the Dead takes place over three thousand years after Ender's Game, and the once-hailed hero of the Bugger Wars is now reviled as the \\"Xenocide,\\" the murderer of the only other known sentient species. Now a new planet has been found bearing intelligent life, though these \\"Piggies\\" are technologically inferior. A colony, Lusitania, is established to study this life form (and ostensibly to check their progress against any future \\"Bugger-like\\" aggression), comprised mostly of culturally Brazilian Catholics. Ender is Andrew Wiggin once again, a \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" who travels from world to world to \\"speak\\" the life stories and inner selves of the departed. It is this very interstellar travel that explains Ender's extended life span, as due to the principles of relativity Ender has aged only to his early 30's during his travels.<br /><br />The novel opens on the colonies, where a large and at first intimidating cast of characters (initially confusingly referred to by both their full and diminuitive names) has populated Lusitania. There are traditionally two xenologers (a sort of anthropologist) who study the Piggies with extreme restraint; the mandate is to influence Piggy culture as little as possible. The Piggies are fascinating and have a well-developed, puzzling culture, and in fact the biology of the entire planet of Lusitania is something of a mystery itself. Inevitably, confusion about the differences between the human and alien culture arise, individuals die, fear settles in, and twenty years later (Lusitania time) the Speaker for the Dead arrives to investigate the deaths and hopefuly both redeem his past and prevent future xenocide.<br /><br />If you think this sounds quite different than Ender's Game, it is; Ender is now an adult dealing with an entirely different set of problems in a very different setting. Speaker for the Dead, unlike its predecessor, is not a stand-alone novel, but feels incomplete without what I am assuming is the resolution in following volumes. It is engaging and well-written (though perhaps not as tightly so as Ender's Game), but is much more emotionally and spiritually driven than the first novel.<br /><br />At times it feels like the constraints of relativity and interstellar travel lend themselves to an awkward fit in the linear time progression of a conventional novel. Characters we start to become attached to are suddenly adults and complete strangers with Ender's arrival (as, I felt, was Ender himself), and are replaced by the next generation in the story's focus. I felt that certain aspects of the book required too much suspension of disbelief, such as the fact that Catholicism remained in a completely recognizable form after thousands of years, and that technology levels hadn't advanced appreciably since the Bugger Wars.<br /><br />Ender still deals with the same power struggles, the same sense of humanity, and Card does an excellent job of addressing the cultural and political aftermath of the original Xenocide and the interactions with the Piggies. One of the book's greatest strenghts and most powerful statements is its treatment of the nature of identity and how we define other cultures as equals or aliens. Once again, Card employs his device of separate referencesat the beginning of each chapter to propel the story, using transcripts of conversations, classified documents, or political treatises to flush out his universe and add a strong element of suspense.<br /><br />In spite of these strengths, Speaker for the Dead simply did not resonate as strongly with me as Ender's Game had, and did not feel like as strong a contribution. It was enjoyable, and thought-provoking, but I am left with the desire for something more. Perhaps that feeling will be alleviated by reading the sequels, but be prepared for a very different reading experience than Ender's Game. You'll enjoy yourself much more.<br /><br />~Jacquelyn Gillel the story, using transcripts of conversations, classified documents, or political treatises to flush out his universe and add a strong element of suspense.

B000089770|5.0|I recently programmed an at-home double feature consisting of SMOKE and GOING MY WAY.  Not exactly an obvious pairing, you might say, but they went together surprisingly well and served as proof positive that I like my sentiment with a dollop of metropolitan grit (or in the case of SMOKE, more than a dollop).    SMOKE has long numbered among my 10 or 20 favorite films.  It's difficult to say just why I haven't posted a review of it until now.  Perhaps because it is so rich, I have avoided taking on the task of explaining its impact to on me to others.  SMOKE has a hold on me that few others do, but (for once) I'm at something of a loss to explain it.  Which is odd in a way--because I think it has something to do with the way we communicate with each other or fail to.  The dialog in the movie, for the most part, rings truer than in most movies--even most GOOD movies.      That doesn't mean that all this authentic talk is meaningful communication.  These are regular Joe's (and a few Joannes) who aren't much into \\"sharing.\\"  That's not to imply that their verbal exchanges are meaningless, but when they're talking sports or cigars, they're doing what the composer of Louis Armstrong's \\"Wonderful World\\" described so aptly when referring to \\"folks shakin'hands, sayin' 'How do you do?\\"  They really are kinda sorta saying, \\"I love you.\\"    But we don't want to get too schmaltzy here.  SMOKE gets in your eyes, and in your heart, by employing such time honored devices as allowing its characters to keep their rough-edged exteriors, but letting the audience see their soft hearts underneath.   Take the two father-child reunion sub-plots.  The father-son re-encounter (the one that ultimately succeeds) contrasts sharply with the father-daughter(?) reunion that, for all intents and purposes, seems like a total failure.  But even in that tragic instance, there may be a grain hope tucked away, thanks to the selflessness of a man who really doesn't believe that he is this lost girl's biological father. His willingness to come to the aide of a young woman who is likely NOT his flesh and blood speaks volumes about the true meaning of \\"charity.\\"  It takes a village--and sometimes it takes a borough.    It bothers me somewhat that the film in its DVD and VHS format seems to have been marketed as a laff-riot comedy.  I don't recall if that was true when it was in theatrical release, but whatever the case, it's a big mistake. The cheery illustration of Keitel, flanked by a healthy-looking Ashley Judd and a sexy Stockard Channing, belies the movie's harsher reality.  Yes, SMOKE does offer a few laughs, but they are hard won and even a little bitter.  The tagline \\"Where's there's SMOKE, there's laughter...\\" isn't even half the story.  There are tears too, of course.  And there's cold reality staring you in the face.  And there are some real \\"mensches\\" out there who help make it all bearable.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a very thought provoking film and a great preparation for Easter in this season of Lent.  It has the power to impact or even change lives.  I whole-heartedly recommend this film.
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I have to both agree with, and take exception to, some of the comments in the CD package's essay about Gary Bertini by Kyo Mitsutoshi, a Japanese music critic and clearly a fan of the late conductor. Mitsutoshi writes of Bertini's objectivity, his esthetic of beauty and classical restraint, and his rendering of these scores as paintings rather than psychodramas. These are all valid points, yet taken together they might easily be misinterpreted to suggest a conductor who lacked a forceful podium presence, who was less than fully involved, and who shied away from the music's darker implications and its moments of deliberate harshness. Actually, what you get in this 11-CD set is music-making that pulses with vibrancy, color, and authenticity--just without the obvious huffing and puffing of a couple of the better-known Mahlerians. The scores' moments of grotesquerie and neurosis are there, but they're not (over)emphasized as with Leonard Bernstein. Instead, we have the suggestion of tensions simmering below surfaces that shimmer with beauty. Avoiding overstatement actually allows those tensions to stand out in sharper, unsettling contrast.    As this review's title suggests, the appearance of this set is revelatory. First, there is the conductor's ability to allow even an experienced Mahler fan to hear these scores afresh. Second, there is the revelation that a more subtle, less over-the-top approach can better delineate both the macro (the overarching design of each symphony) as well as micro (details such as splashes of color and important subsidiary lines that are usually glossed over), along with conveying the music's psychological depths. (And don't think that Bertini pulls any punches in moments such as the \\"with the greatest vehemence\\" climax of the Ninth Symphony's opening movement.) Third, there's the \\"where have you been all my life?\\" aspect of this boxed set. These recordings were made between 1984 and 1991 and only sporadically available in the U.S. upon their initial releases. For many Mahlerites both here and abroad, the posthumous release of this bargain-priced anthology represents the first opportunity (as it was for me) to hear what they've missed all these years. Bertini, whose death in 2005 was ignored by the British music press, turns out to have been one of the greatest Mahler conductors--and now you can hear this for yourself in beautifully played, spectacularly well-recorded performances. Yes, there are a few quibbles: a detail here and there that might have gotten greater emphasis, a few vocal passages where the generally fine soloists sound strained, the inconvenient splitting of both the Third AND Fourth Symphonies between discs (unavoidable, apparently, due to the limitations of CD length). But those are minor complaints about a collection that on balance just might be the finest complete Mahler cycle available, in terms of both performance and sound quality.
B00005JNX0|4.0|\\"Madagascar\\" must be a very maddening movie for young kids who go with their parents, because at moments when they are not laughing their parents very well could be and the kiddies will have no clue why.  After all, how many pre-teens have seen the end of the original version of \\"The Planet of the Apes,\\" the beginnings of \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and \\"Chariot of Fire,\\" or have even heard the theme song from \\"Born Free\\"?  I expect they may have seen \\"Castaway\\" and might well recognize a homage to the dancing hippos from \\"Fantasia,\\" but is it reasonable to think they saw \\"The Twilight Zone\\" episode \\"To Serve Man\\"?  I realize that when kids are laughing they probably are not aware of what their parents or guardians are doing, but since they will not be laughing at most of these pop culture references to other films, they may well be awrae that the older people are watching a different movie.<br /><br />Ultimately the problem is that the different \\"Madagascar\\" that the grownups are watching is clearly funnier than the one that is trying to keep the wee folk entertained.  The story is about four animals who are best buds at the Central Park Zoo.  Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is the star of the show and a devotee of raw steak, while Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is tired of looking at the fake jungle painted on the wall and longs to be free in the wild, not really knowing what that means.  Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac, worried about the brown spots on his skin, while Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinikett Smith), is a rather contented soul.  But when the quartet of penguins decide to make a break for Antarctica, Marty gets out on the streets of New York City, which forces Alex and the others to rescue him.  Their trip to Grand Central Station is seen by the humans as a quest for freedom and against the will of three of the four friends, they are crated up and put on a ship bound for Africa so they can be happy (the humans who come up with this saw the movie \\"Free Willy,\\" but never read the news stories about what happened when the star of those films was released into the ocean).<br /><br />To say that they end up in Madagascar rather than Africa might seem like a minor distinction since the island is off the coast of the continent and therefore part of the same land mass, but it is important that the place is NOT Africa.  Africa is a place where there are prides of lions, herds of zebras, and so forth.  Madagascar is a place where there is a division between the lemurs and their small friends, ruled by the wacky Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen), who is advised by the more sedate Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer), and the hyenas, who do not talk, following the tradition of really bad animals in movies populated by talking animals (e.g., the rats in \\"Lady and the Tramp\\").  This matters because it makes the newcomers the biggest animals around (the \\"New York giants\\" to the locals), and Alex a true king of the jungle (he terrifies the hyenas when he is not trying to and Julian wants Alex to try really hard to terrify the hyenas).<br /><br />\\"Madagascar\\" is an anti-\\"Call of the Wild\\" in that the biggest conflict becomes not the ability of the zoo animals to survive in the wild or to save the lemurs from the hyenas, but rather keeping Alex from converting to his natural state in which case Marty and the others are literally the walking steaks he misses so much.  Few friendships can survive one friend sinking their teeth into the butt of another, and the tightrope this 2005 animated film must walk is that we have to fear that Alex is going to eat the rest of the cast.  But then we remember, to adapt the wise words of Chandler Bing, that this would just mean they stop drawing the zebra.  However, it is hard to complain about the rhetorical aspects of a film whose chief message is that you should not eat your friends (I bet small kids would get the idea that film is the anti-\\"Silence of the Lambs\\").  Not a classic by anymeans, but I know how often I laughed out loud, so I have to round up.y any means, but I know how often I laughed out loud, so I have to round up.
1851774408|5.0|The only thing you could wish for after reading this book is that the late, great Janet Arnold had graphed patterns of all them.  This book is absolutely essential if you re-create older clothes and you want to know what fabrics actually looked and draped like.  I found it especially helpful to have the descriptions give the fabric names and weaves, as well.  The close up photos show the stitches, pleating, and trimmings. And what colors!  The trims!  Buy it before the unthinkable occurs--that the book goes out of print!  If you can only buy one costume book this year, let this be the one.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I was wondering how many period pieces had been worked into the musical score for the latest theatrical version of Jane Austen's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and discovered the answer is none.  Composer Dario Marianelli (\\"The Brothers Grimm\\") is working with the same instrumentation that Austen would have been familiar with, which would be a chamber orchestra and works dominated by the piano and/or strings.  The result of this approach is simply to wish that more historical films employed the same approach.  Marianelli also gets credit for developing his score in reaction to the novel itself before the screenplay was really developed (at least that is what I hear, and if true it deserves to be mentioned).  I find the score somewhat reminiscent of Michael Nyman's for \\"The Piano,\\" although that is more because of the use of the instrument, played by Jean-Yves Thibaudet most notably on tracks like \\"Dawn,\\" \\"The Living Sculptures of Pemberly,\\" and \\"Arrival to Netherfield,\\" than on the type of piano music.  There is certainly not a dominant theme to the \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" score as we have for \\"The Piano.\\"  Often the music is more simplistic, but this suits the purpose of finely etching out the character of Elizabeth Bennett on the piano.<br /><br />The tracks are not really arranged in order of the film's chronology; for example, \\"Georgiana,\\" the piano piece played by Darcy's sister that is developed into fuller concerto, comes later in the film but appears here as the sixth track, sandwiched between \\"The Militia Marches In\\" and \\"Arrival to Netherfield.\\"  However, by the end of the disc the final scenes of the film are played out in the established order, with \\"Your Hands Are Cold,\\" \\"Mrs. Darcy,\\" and the \\"End Credits\\" taking us back to the unofficial \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" theme overlayed with more luscious strings than before, similar to the effect in \\"Darcy's Letter.\\"  My only real complaint is that the dance music of \\"Meryton Townhall\\" sounds rather lifeless with the sound of dancing feet and clapping hands, so it remains one piece that is more effective in hearing it during the second scene on your DVD than listening to it on this CD.<br /><br />The illusion that these are true period pieces is central to their success, because this score sounds classical while at the same time underscoring the romance of the film.  I know so many it is outright heresy, but I consider this version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" to be the most romantic version I have seen to date.  The main reason for my verdict is that this time around when Elizabeth walks into Netherfield with her hair down and Darcy is so stunned by her beautiful appearance, I know from that moment on that he loves her (in most versions we really have no more clue that Lizzie, and so we are all equally stunned when Darcy makes the most backhanded proposal in English literature).  But this evocative score gets credit as well for never letting us forget for all the charming comedy of character, \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is still the most popular romance of all-time (double-suicides by Veronese teenagers being worth of copious tears but not actual emulation).  Just think of it as music to read Jane Austen by and that alone can justifying picking up this soundtrack.ancing feet and clapping hands, so it remains one piece that is more effective in hearing it during the second scene on your DVD than listening to it on this CD. <br /> <br />The illusion that these are true period pieces is central to their success, because this score sounds classical while at the same time underscoring the romance of the film.

B0000DG00B|4.0|This two-CD set might well be subtitled \\"The Allman Brothers in All Their Glory and Then Some,\\" as the first disc, clocking in at a colossal 79:55, still isn't long enough to capture all of the second part of the instrumental \\"Mountain Jam\\" - yet another testament to the ABB's tireless musical powers. That fadeout ultimately makes little difference, however, as \\"Mountain Jam,\\" like many of the tracks here, is on both discs - comparison fanatics take note!  <br />   Recorded on July 3rd and 5th, 1970, these performances (before a crowd of over a quarter million) fall roughly midway between the LUDLOW GARAGE and AMERICAN UNIVERSITY sets both chronologically and musically. One can hear the beginnings of the astounding guitar solos which would dominate the famed 1971 Fillmore East performances, even as soon-to-be-discarded early numbers like \\"Every Hungry Woman\\" and \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" add welcome variety to the set list. The recording quality is excellent, allowing one to savor every soaring lick and earth-shaking chord. The Brothers still hadn't quite reached their Fillmore-era peak, but they were well on their way, and LIVE AT THE ATLANTA POP FESTIVAL is a riveting reminder of how many days and nights on the road it took to make this the greatest live band that's ever been. Four and a half stars for two and a half hours of sheer sonic genius!
6302914213|4.0|After it was revealed who killed Laura Palmer the series didn't seem to have any clear direction.This may be one of the things that led to the show's decline and cancellation and if that wasn't bad enough David Lynch ends the series with the most nightmarish episode ever leaving fans choking on their damn fine cups of coffee.The next to last episode ends with an eerie strobelit confrontation but it's the last episode itself that delivers the real chills.Agent Coopers journey into the mysterious otherworldly Red Lodge is supremely creepy.Beginning with the hypnotic song Under the Sycamore Trees(Which you can find on the Twin Peaks:Fire Walk With Me soundtrack)to agent Cooper being pursued from room to room by his evil dopelganger.Masterfully directed by David Lynch it's equal to any of his best creepy movies like Lost Highway.Like being woken up in a middle of a nightmare it will leave you hanging but will stay in your mind forever.I don't remember T.V. shows I've seen last night but the final episode of Twin Peaks still haunts me 15 years later.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Felt like I went on a trip after seeing this movie. This movie was well worth it. Featuring exotic locations and car chases that are really captivating. The characters in the movie played their parts convincingly well, that you felt part of the movie.<br /><br />The sequel further develops the character of Jason Borne and provides more insights into his past as his amnesia seems to be wearing out. And how his emotional 'conflicts' are making this into a three dimensional James Bond type movie.  What can I say; this is better than Bond series, with all the actions, sophisticated car chase scenes, the cat and mouse chase and the tactic between the killing machine and the world biggest organization. The soundtrack is also great.

0609610570|3.0|<br />Quite a great book to read, this is among those books that create the classic paradigm shift in thinking - which is like seeing a set of dots and suddenly a picture of a girl emerges! So in its concept, the book clearly scores ahead of other works and is an eye opener. <br /> <br />Where this specific book falters greatly though, is its style of presentation. Somewhere, one gets the feeling of being preached down to. This feeling is further enhanced with the nature of examples cited, which are very broad brush-strokes on the canvas of corporate life. This would thus leave tremendous room for interpretation by the reader and could get `wrongly' construed. However, therein also lies a bit of the charm surrounding the book - its an uncomfortable read in some sense - since it tends to open flanks in ones own thinking and is hard-hitting on ones theoretical constructs, so there is a natural denial to some of the themes that are used to illustrate the principles. Having said that, some of the themes also border on sensationalism, and delight in extremities which makes the book a little hard to believe, since the solutions are not detailed in depth & one is left with a feeling of \\"Hey, that's quite a motherhood statement to make, for such a serious issue!\\" <br /> <br />But in spite of my above views on the books' shortcomings, I recommend it for reading to every business leader who has a team and is responsible for taking decisions - the book does outline a wonderful approach and leaves room for interpretation on the execution of the approach! <br />
B0002KQNZO|5.0|In 1964 Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers stepped into Rudy van Gelder's studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, and probably melted the inside of the building.  With great material and truly special inspiration, they created a record of the most uncompromising, in-your-face hard bop recorded to date.  Musical director Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone contributes two high energy originals and probably the best playing of his five year Messengers tenure, Freddie Hubbard contributes the other two tunes, one original and one arrangement, and also blows his brains out on trumpet, Curtis Fuller adds a rich third voice and some great trombone playing, Cedar Walton plays some great and tasteful piano, both in accompaniment and solo, Reggie Workman really pushes the sound of the band into a more advanced rhythmic feel, and Art Blakey of course plays like a man on fire, creating volcanic energy that kicks the band up to a superhuman level.  Fine, this description may sound like Leonard Feather-esque hype, but it's really not.  This album is incredible. <br /> <br />The whole album is great but there are two standout tracks.  The first is the eleven minute title track.  A perfectly formed Wayne Shorter original, it is voiced in rich three part harmony over an insistent rhythmic figure (though not rigid--Reggie Workman's embellishments and displacement of time makes it a very free-flowing feel) and a bridge whose release and buildup of tension sounds a lot like a train getting closer.  The solos from the horns and Blakey are very intense and Shorter and Hubbard shred in particular.  The high energy level is maintained throughout this tune, then the next two are almost as intense (\\"Hammerhead\\" drops the tempo without losing any of the energy) before culminating in the perfectly placed \\"Pensativa.\\"  It is a beautiful Clare Fischer medium-up Latin tune gorgeously arranged by Freddie Hubbard.  I took four hours once to transcribe the arrangement and its absolutely brilliant use of tension in the horn voicings.  This tune keeps the energy of before but the intensity level backs off and it's the perfect close to a great album. <br /> <br />This album will appeal to those who enjoy \\"Mosaic,\\" an earlier Messengers outing with similar personnel.  This album is in a similar vein but better.  In terms of Art Blakey newcomers, \\"Moanin'\\" or \\"The Big Beat\\" is a better place to start, but once you're ready for this album, it will blow your mind.
0140042520|4.0|<br />...but I had to expound on that on account of all these bad reviews. <br /> <br />If this book is not for you to get then that's fine and it's sad, but don't be so angry--coherence isn't everything.  It's the heart that makes Kerouac, the sailing, pounding, beautiful, soulful, angry, churning, palpable heart. <br /> <br />And for those who worry that this is required scene material, the beat poets are dead, let them be.  Read for yourself and its own rewards.  That should be obvious; now go, enjoy this epic soul journey.
B000667FN8|2.0|I am tired of hearing bad reviews from people who have never listened to the band and automatically assume that they are posers.  My friend let me borrow the CD, and I listened to it.  IT WAS HALF-DECENT. <br /> <br />Okay, so these guys are definitely not punk rock to start with.  They use power chords that are slurred most of the time, a bit more intricate for the pop-punk genre than the occassional repetitive rhythm guitar strumming the same exact string for three straight minutes.  The drums are a mess though, they sound like a two-year old beating on pots and pans.  The bass was actually not as bad as I expected it to be, it was audible.  The lyrics were typical teen-pop angst driven, you get the picture--no creativity besides the rhyming.  I just didn't like how all of the tracks sounded nearly the same, I guess that's just how pop-punk is getting to sound these days.  <br /> Key Tracks: <br />Shut Up <br />Jump <br />Crazy (the guitar intro was a takeoff of Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Today\\") <br /> <br />I would reccomend this CD to to intended audience, ten year olds.  It's not HORRID, but it's certainly not great.
0790729601|1.0|Eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention, but overall the movie displayed poor acting, stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot. This movie possibly will be owned by many, but remembered by few. James Caan was the only talent that Eraser has to offer. Sorry guys, my wife bought it, I watched it, gave it away and divorced her.
B00000IREA|4.0|About the top of her sexuality, Jane protrays a space hunter.  Even though she is no actress, the nudity and her nudity are probly worth watching.  With her ignorance of the war in Viet Nam that turned many people against her, it is a little slow but imaginative It will be a camp classic of films. Directed by her husbund he goes just to the edge, except at the begging, there is a lot of nudity (not Janes, except teaseing parts).  Althoug children could watch it (over 15.)  It is entertaining and a must for a library.  If only it was on DVD. I don't know if 15 and up would understand what wasgoing on, it would be a good movie as a starter. Preview it yourself before making a decision.
0451196716|5.0|i started reading this book about 2 weeks ago at my local barnes and noble only reading 40-50 pages each time.  Yesterday i decided to buy it and i have spent the past 5 hours finishing it.  I will not give a summary of the novel, as that has been done several times by other reviewers.  I will only say that this novel kept me hooked and i found myself speeding up more and more and more until i got to the end.  While reading this book, i prayed this book would have a good ending.  Honestly, i am not sure if i liked the ending or not.  I will not tell you what it is, but i will say that it is pretty much open to interpretation.  Probobly the most vauge ending ive ever read for a book.  It doesnt answer a lot of the questions you have throughout the book.  I recommend this to absoutly everyone! While reading, pay very close attention to the mysterious character known as Stebbins.  Something is revealed about him in the last chapter that made my jaw drop and i had to go back and re-read it about 12 times before absorbing it.  Excellent book, if you like books that will make you think, this is defaintly the book for you.
B000BT97AO|4.0|Helena is an artistically talented teenager who is part of a circus family, and when her mother becomes seriously ill after they have an argument, she naturally feels responsible. During the night before her mother's major surgery, she wakes up in a weird, phantasmagoric land based on her own drawings, where the \\"balance has been upset\\" and the Queen of Light lies in a deathlike sleep as shadows destroy her kingdom. Only Helena, with the help of a rogue named Valentine, can wake the Queen, as well as returning to her own world, where an \\"anti-Helena\\" is wreaking havoc with her life, by finding a mysterious \\"charm.\\"<br /><br />There is obviously a lot of psychological symbolism in this film, but the creators are not in your face about it. I think that many people will recognize the portrayal of the inner turmoil that teenagers often face as they attempt to separate from their parents while still maintaining a loving relationship. And of course, betrayal, forgiveness and redemption are themes that will resonate with viewers of any age.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, with the involvement of Neil Gaiman and Jim Henson Productions, the conception of the alternate reality, as well as its realization on film, is awesome.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I was a little skeptical going into this movie, but I had heard such good things about it I decided to give it a shot.  Wow, man I was surprised and in a good way.  While a dark movie it is still excellent and leave you wanting to watch it multiple times.  While Jake Gyllenhaal is the lead look for Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Seth Rogen, and more to make smaller appearances.  A must see, this movie will blow you away.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Words can't express how amazing this band and cd is.  Way back when I heard some of Panic's demo stuff I was like \\"hmmm not bad but they are probably just a Fall Out Boy rip off.\\"  Thankfully I was mistaken.  I decided to get the cd anyway and I must say I have not been that impressed in a long time.  So original, so smart, so freakin good!!  I just have to dance everytime I listen!  These guys are just 18 and 19 years old and have already created a masterpiece!  I'm going to see them live on the 23rd of this month.  Can't wait!  Bravo!
6301868684|5.0|i own every single film this actress has done, and i watch her religiously. sure, julia roberts and others have oscars for their forgettable work, but jennifer is the one and only actress who actually has range and a gift to bring to a character to life. actresses in today's hollywood scene need to take a lesson and learn what jennifer does with her enormous gift. she researches characters and comes across the screen effortlessly, which nobody has been able to do. she is the ONLY actress i pay attention to and the only important one, which is inexplicably ignored at oscar time! yes, jennifer has won numerous awards for her work, but usually from the indepedent spirits, golden globes, sundance, critics film circle, and others. this chameleon of an actress <br />has done it all and can do no wrong. and until she finally grabs that gold man by the balls, hollywood will be kicking themselves for NOT rewarding her wih the most honorable statuette in history for her lengthy list of previous classics!!!!
B000003TA4|1.0|I hate nirvana, they are the worst band in the freakin universe, how could anyone like them? I think that anyone who comitts suicide shouldnt sell records. Take my advice and don't even consider them.  <br /> <br />peace out! <br /> <br />ps rap sucks even worse!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I have to start off saying that i am a very big Jane Austen fan. Also my fav is Sense and Sensibility so i can give an fairly neutral review. <br /> <br />First of all i have to say there was much more sexual tension in this one. I love the scene where Mr Darcy helped Lizzy in the carriage. I loved how he moved his hand. <br />The most surprising and best scene is the almost kiss. I thought this was appropriate of two people who did not care the actions but still had some feelings for one another. I do feel that the on screen chemistry was good. <br /> <br />Did the movie take huge liberties with the book. Yes.  <br /> <br />I think the thing that most bothered me was when Elizabeth walked in with her hair down. That would not have happened ever. Hair down was only meant for bed and your husband. That would not have happened.  <br /> <br />Overall all it was o.k.  It was an o.k. modern rendition.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Things are getting darker in the world of wizarding world. 12 years after the dark lord Voldemort disappeared, his loyal followers were tracked down and locked away in Azkaban, the most secure of wizard prisons...or so it was. Now the most feared and dangerous of these prisoners, Sirius Black as escaped and is after none other than 13 year old Harry Potter. While all those who are true to Harry stay close to make sure he is safe Harry can only wonder who this dark soul is and why he is not only out kill him, but the painful fact that links him to the death of Harrys parents.<br /><br />This book is still the fan favorite of the Harry Potter saga, but it surley is the worst of the movies thus far. Don't get me wrong there are some great moments in the movie as well as some great new actors that joined the cast. Gary Oldman was chosen to play Sirius Black and eventhough he is only on screen for the last half hour of the movie he never ceases to amaze with an absolutaly stellar performance. That and the acting of Emma Thompson and comic releif of Rupert Grint is why this movie actully got two stars.<br /><br />What ruined the movie was surley the adaptation of the book to film because it was all out of order the only part that was perfect was the time travel which takes up almost 45 minutes of the movie. The new director Alfonso Curion really focused on Harry and barley any of the other characters. It was as if all the bonds of all the supporting cast memebers were stripped away only so Harry and the new memebers of the cast could have their day in the sun. This is also the shortest of all the movies. I am sure the fans would not have minded an extra 20-30 minutes of movie to watch, especially if it was a scene with the Hogwarts Quiddith Cup finals.<br /><br />Now with the 4th instalment on its way I am hoping that Columbus and the crew learn from their mistakes and if they want to cut out a few things for the sake of cinema and potty breaks they better learn from the disaster that 'Prisoner of Azkaban turned out to be.er of Azkaban turned out to be.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is a movie our entire family from 4-50 truly enjoyed.  The characters and story are incredible.  Our older child was given a gentle lesson about environmentalism and this has become one of our favorite movies.
B00008DDXC|4.0|And so the second year begins at Hogwarts school of witchcraft & wizardry. As does the second cinema adaptation of the world of Harry Potter. This piece in the saga starts off right on a good note when Harry is visited by a mysterious elf named Dobby, who warns him that terrible things are going to happen at Hogwarts this year and that Harry must stay away. Unwilling to listen Harry finds out with his good friends Ron & Hermione that long ago one of the founders of the school created a secret chamber where a hidden chapter of the school's history has lay dormant for 50 years. Now there are bloodstained messages on the school walls and non-magical born students are ending up in comas, but worse all fingers are pointing at Harry Potter. Now Harry must question and dive into a world that has been locked away only to bring the secrets of the hidden chamber out in the open.<br /><br />This movie as well as the book is by far my favorite in the saga. This movie really shows significant character development and true bonds of friendship through Harry and his companions. Chris Columbus did a fantastic job for his final directorial attempt, still keeping close to the original story, but also really working with the kids bringing their acting abilities up to speed with the aging characters to make the audience connect with the characters as they did in the book.<br /><br />While the movie is better than its predecessor, it still does rank as the best in the saga for there is still much to learn and 5 more years left to go.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Thanks goodness someone out there is brave enough to question the incredible hijacking of this country by this Hitler-like regime. It is incredible the lengths this administration has gone to in an attempt to justify it's manipulation of America and the rest of the world. The \\"Right\\" (which has grown to be synonymous with Christian fundamentalists, thanks to their complete annihilation of the boundary between church and state) wanted to hang Clinton for such things as having tried marijuana or having an affair (which happened to be a personal matter, completely unrelated to his job performance), yet Bush had a long and well-known addiction to Cocaine, womanizing, alcoholism, etc. Such behavior makes Clinton's antics look like a tea party by comparison. But that same party feels that Bushs' indiscretions are acceptable now that their man is up. Often characteristic of the Christian Right hypocrisy.<br /><br />In addition, we have terrorists that have entered, and will continue to enter our country to seek revenge on our soil as long as we continue to unfairly bully, discredit and ignore their and others concerns, especially in regards to how such groups/countries are treated by the USA. So the longer we drone on with this \\"war on terrorism,\\" the more people we anger in the world. If not due to our direct attacks on them/their country, certainly our negligence of their plight or our complete disregard for their concerns about our actions (or lack of, in some cases) will undoubtedly leave a wound sufficient to fuel some long term hostility. If we haven't angered enough people directly in the war, we've angered them indirectly with our arrogant, self-righteous, entitlement perpetrated by this administration to justify our mistreatment or abandonment of people/countries harboring both our allies and enemies.<br /><br />With all of the anger and disdain the Bush administration has single-handedly warranted towards our country, the potential for us to be targeted for terrorism has risen exponentially. Since we live in a free country, it is extremely difficult to prevent those that seek to harm us from entering our country, this has been modeled numorously. The degredation of our global citizenship, the greater the desire to harm us. Bush has not fought a war on terrorism; he has positively ensured the future of disastrous and destructive terrorism, both domestically and internationally. This will be targeted towards both us and our allies, worst of all far too many innocent people.<br /><br />The Administration has no regard for those men and women and their families that are so selflessly offering themselves up to execute his evil agenda. After all, it's not his family over there on the front lines. His behavior has been worthy of impeachment more than all who came before him. From his slow, basically non-existent response to Katrina and his dumbfounded stall to the news that our Country was under attack to his insistence on chasing down and threatening anyone that doesn't agree with him. Particularly if we are going to take into account his alcoholism, cocaine addiction and womanizing among other things. He actually infiltrated a group of 10 anti-war protestors in one small town. Do we not have bigger fish to fry as a nation, than him using his time, energy and our money to track down every group or individual who disagrees with him. Or rally congress to ensure that two people that love each other can NEVER (via constitutional amendment) be allowed to marry? Is this truly the best use of the leader of the free world's efforts? When you go over the short list of top priority concerns for this great Nation and beyond, gay marriage is right up on the top. Gee, I can think of about a thousand things I'd be so much more concerned about, like our rates of homelessness, abused and neglected children, the many millions that go to sleep each night hungry in this world, illiteracy, poverty, unemployment, uninsured populations, crime and gangridden cities, FOREIGN RELATIONS, the economy, our budget deficit, our Social Security System, to name a few.<br /><br />Not to mention his endless insistence that otherwise discarded stem-cells cannot be used to save millions of lives because they are a form of life and therefore should be held sacred as one would treat any other human life. Human life sacred!! What about the human lives he is over desecrating daily in Iraq, on both sides? Oh, so human life is only sacred if it's human stem-cells on American soil? Who cares about any other form of human life or how many will lose their lives because of his not supporting stem-cell research. Those lives are not important. So apparently human life is only important in certain situations and applies to only certain humans. Like if you're Iraqi, your life is not sacred and therefore we will kill you. Thousands of Iraqi civilians have died or been cruelly and inappropriately detained as a result of our \\"war on terrorism.\\" But save those stem-cells, by god they fall under the sanctity of human life. What so many of his followers don't understand is that as busy as he is off bullying other Countries, he is simultaneously at home, quietly and not-so-quietly sticking it to the American public as well. So thank you, Michael Moore. Though because your documentary was created a few years ago, you had no way of knowing all of the follow-up material that would be available for a sequel by this day and age, and imagine the possibilities we still have 2 years to go. Wake up America! When are we going to put the skids on this out-of-control drunken frat boy, whom so eloquently demonstrates the old adage \\"it's not what you know, but who you know.\\" For Mr. Bush and his supporters I have one question (actually many), but with your sanctity on human life, could you just explain to me who Jesus would bomb?
0765348780|4.0|It has been a while since an author has come along and tried to tackle something so huge.  Erikson writes about gods, mages, dragons - you name it and it is there.  The problem with this is that it is very hit and miss.  Luckily for us, Erikson hit it, although just barely. <br /> <br />His plotline is very direct and to the point.  There are no diatribes or long winded explanations of what is happening.  When someone is going to die or there is a battle it is stated directly.  There aren't whole chapters devoted to one fight scene and so on.  So this is a plus.  A downside to making his series so fantastical  - such as beings coming from under the ground - without there being any mention of such creatures - just in the nick of time to save someone - is that it can be a little harder to suspend reality. <br /> <br />On the flipside it is great to see an author tackle so much.  Not since Mickey Zucker Reichert have we seen a world of gods and men and wars written about without missing a beat, and being able to do it well!  One of my favorite scenes is an ascendant walking in holding a demon by a wing as though he were some piece of trash he had picked up.  Great scene and it goes well with the book. <br /> <br />I give three and a half stars, for although it was an enjoyable read, it took a while to get into it and I know Erikson's writing will get better over time.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a new fantasy author to distract them from the Jordans and Goodkinds of the genre. <br />
B000002UQJ|4.0|Reading over some of the reviews on McCartney's work here has made me a bit upset. Although Off The Ground is not a classic album or a masterpiece, it has it's moments and it's worth. <br />A lot of the songs are silly and meaningless, such as Hope of Deliverance (which by the way is fun to hear on occasion) but let's not dismiss or forget the wonderful moments on this album such as the masterpieces of Winedark Open Sea, C'Mon People and the beautiful and melodic Mistress and Maid and Golden Earth Girl. Get real people! Paul is a human being and I'm glad he is!
B000002ULO|4.0|Fisrt, let me say that I'm a die-hard Beatles fanatic with a \\"penchant\\" for the cynical and rough edge of John Lennon (my all-time favorite \\"working class hero\\" but let's give credit where credit is due... <br />Although I still miss dearly John and a tear comes to my eyes everytime I listen to his or his \\"Beatle's music(even after 25 years since his murder), I also love Sir Paul. \\"Imagine\\" if Paul & John  were still collaborating at times today! I must admit that Paul's music has been inconsistent over the solo years, although he has left us treasured gems on almost every one of his solo endeavors...mostly from the likes of McCartney, Ram, Band on the run, Tug of war and my personal choice of Back to the egg. <br />True at times he has recorded dismissable Silly Love Songs and unfortunately has collaborate with the likes of the \\"former King of Pop\\", he has always been able to remind us of his contributions and the success of the Beatles. Let's face it, anything Paul ever does or has ever done on his own will always be compared to or critcized from a Beatle's point of view, as such was done to Lennon's solo work. The solo work and years will never be cherished or praised as much as what the Fab Four were all about. But as I sit here listening to \\"Flaming Pie\\" which I had shelved and forgotten about for years, I realize today what an excellent piece of work this is! Paul has the ability with his vocals and his melodic compositions and arrangements to win you over every time. Despite all he's done which has been forgettable and dismissable by critics and fans alike, he is still and will always be a musical GENIUS who has left us a gift we should cherish, discover and rediscover. Several of the ballads on \\"Flaming Pie\\" are reminiscent of such ballads on the \\"White Album\\" as Mother Nature's son and Blackbird. Such beautiful songs and melodies on this album like Calico Skies and Young Boy and the Beatlesque symphony of Great Day. I can overlook the not so wonderful periods of Sir Paul's legacy but I feel obliged to give him recognition for the Great and Good he's done and is still doing. Long Live Paul, John, George and Ringo in my heart, soul and memories. Thank You All
0393327655|5.0|Excellent book.  Needed book.  It says a lot of things I have thought for years.  It goes to the heart of how we structure our world cognitively.  Although this deals with a lot of specific religious issues, this book serves as a primer in theory of knowlegde (epistemology).  This book is highly recommended.  Hopefully, it can be read by those who have a large faith component in their personal cognitive map.  We need more people to speak up as Harris has.
B00005JNJV|2.0|I didn't like the film nearly as much as the 1989, 1992 and 1995 movies, but yes, it was WAY WAY WAY WAY better than the 1997 film. Still not as good as the first Batman and I think I liked even Batman Forever more than this one. <br /> <br />Firstly, if you're going to end up knowing who killed Wayne's parents, fine, but make it someone worthy (like the Joker). Batman never knew who killed his parents in the comic and I think that was vital to why he continues to be Batman. When are screenwriters going to realize not to tinker with the comic. What made Spiderman and X-Men work was that it honored the core elements of the comic.  <br /> <br />Secondly, the villians were kind of plain. They don't need to be toony and over-the-top like Two-Face and the Riddler were, but a good mix of gritty realism and comic appeal (i.e. Jack Nicholson, Devito and Phiffer) would have helped. <br /> <br />They also had no cool superhero music. All great superhero movies from Superman's I and II, to X-Men to Spiderman all have great superhero music. I loved the gritty Elfman theme and the Batman Forever theme worked too, even if the rest of the movie was a bit over the top. Where's the superhero music? <br /> <br />Finally, the Batmobile didn't look like a car, it looked liked a tank. The Batmobile is supposed to be stylish.  <br /> <br />Liked the fact that it was grittier than the last two films and had good narrative, I think it tried too hard not to be 'Batman and Robin.' Michael Keaton did a great job with the first two and there was no need to totally separate it from the previous franchise, which was actually really good except for the last one.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|the show had survived two seasons and gaining viewers as it went. but unlike the previous two seasons we notice something in the girls and everyone else that we had never seen before. during the season opener we watched lorelei's strange dream about being married and having a baby with luke that confused us as much as it did her. we watched as lorelei finally decided to take the plunge and start her own bussiness with her best friend sookie. we watch rory swept up in the quest of getting into the perfect college (under the influence of her grandparents of course). and then we have the men who line the gilmore girl's lives and those of their friends. such as luke as we see him dating a cute and funny lawyer working for taylor. there is dean who in a moment of frustration breaks up with rory and months later begins dating (and proposing to) a sweet blonde named lindsey. there is jess, luke's bad-boy nephew, who begins dating rory and making her life more confusing than it has ever been( not that his life makes any sense either). and then we have the cute newcomer dave who not only asks lane to join his band but also asks her to prom which she excitedly agreed to both.<br /><br />but much is learned in this season too. after a fire strikes the inn lorelei learns that she can run a bussiness and that maybe she really is ready to start her own inn. rory learns that realationships arent always easy and that she will realationships that arent lined with roses. so as we leave the girls at the end of the season one about to learn about starting a bussiness, the other about college life, we know that these girls are closer than ever.
B000056BOR|5.0|Entertaining, pleasant, feel good movie.  I love anything Cary Grant and this was an excellent romance movie.  I highly recommend this movie.  A+
B0000073NC|5.0|An absolute classic from Scorpions. Meine, Roth, Buchholz are all amazing on this album. <br />I grewup listening this and other Scorpions albums of that era, 20 years later it sounds just as fresh.  Also check check out Tokyo Tapes... what I woundn't do for the live footage of this!
B00005JKDR|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, as did my 2 1/2 year old. There are a few scenes that made me laugh out loud. It's not mine or my 2 year old's favorite Pixar movie (such as Finding Nemo and Toy Story), but it's definitely worth having in your collection.
B000063DFN|5.0|Seems like short reviews on this one. Amazon doesn't even list the tracks... doesn't matter. By far the heaviest MAIDEN around, F'in ROCKS!!!!!! Don't F around... do yourself a favor and purchase this mother F'er, or go take a piss sittin' down!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is an astounding movie and portrayal of Johnny Cash and his wife June. Yes, this movie is a biography, but many may not know-unless you've seen it- that it's a beautiful love story. The love these two people shared was incredible and amazing! It's brought to magnificent life by Phoenix and Witherspoon who both deserve every award under the son for their performances. <br />They both sang the songs-no mouthing the words to the original recordings- which makes their performances even better. <br />I can't stress how great this movie really is.
B0002EXH4A|4.0|Fans of hard rock, difficult instrumental parts, instrumental variety, strong lyrics and vocals, with a dark sound; will love this stuff.  If the above categories hit you, this is one you should think about getting.
0307276902|5.0|Like many I picked up this book only AFTER the scandal broke out involving the author and the lies in the book. I was curious what the big deal was about. <br /> <br />I began reading it as fiction so as not to have too many expectations. Well no matter what I thought in the begining of the book it quickly dissoled into my love for the characters. The book is incredibly written. The characters are colorful and unique and personable. I felt like I was there watching James' progress in the Rehab Program. <br /> <br />The story is inredible and full of pain, anger sorrow, love, destruction, family and HOPE! I highly recommend this book as it is one of the best written books I have read in a while. <br /> <br />If you can look past the controversy, no matter if its fact or fiction this is a book that you will enojoy.
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X never ceases to amaze me.  For one thing, this album ROCKS.  This is some of the most grooving and powerful heavy metal you can get.  Then of course, there is the musicianship.  I mean, every musician who listens to this knows that these guys can play, plain and simple.  The icing on the cake here is that the songs are GOOD and catchy.  Very rarely do they venture into lame territory with the vocals (like many bands in this genre).  The Odyssey is a must own for metal fans, period.
B000001FMX|5.0|The reason i think this is the best album ever is simple. First it paved the way for punk as did MC5 and The Stooges. The second reason is the songs are amazing and Johnny Thunders is the best guitarist ever if you don't think so just check out his later work (LAMF, So Alone, Que Sera Sera, New Too Much Junkie Business). If you think The Ramones invented punk rock you are dead wrong it all started with MC5 and The Stooges and got really good at this point.
B000B19BCG|4.0|Supergrass' \\"Road to Rouen\\" snuck out late last year with little to no warning or fanfare.  I'm lucky I found it! <br /> <br />I've been a big Supergrass fan for awhile.  So it's nice to see the band \\"grow up\\" and mature on this record.  The overall sound on this album is a lot fuller than their previous work.   <br /> <br />Road to Rouen feels like one of those 70's concept/art albums.  It has a great, solid feel and atmosphere throughout.  It doesn't get too young/goofy/corny like they've been know to do in the past (which may or may not be a good thing). <br /> <br />Either way, I think it's a great album.  It is only 9 songs long, about 33 minutes long, which is one complaint.  It's still worth picking up.
B00004SZWB|5.0|I purchased this CD because it has the tune \\"Happy Birthday\\" honoring Martin Luther King.  I have the LP, but wanted to have a means of preserving this music. <br /> <br />The whole CD is excellent listening and vintage Stevie sounds.
B00005JOFO|5.0|That the people who are writing negative reviews about \\"BBM\\" are writing the shortest reviews on every page? <br />Why, it's as if they hadn't seen it!! It just get's called \\"Liberal Propoganda\\" even though there is never any politicism in the film, only the Conservatives are trying to politicize this film.   <br />These white-trash crybabies need to realize that this movie wasn't the invention of \\"liberal Hollywood.\\" Rather it was adapted from a short story that was written years ago, but, as is the case with Repbulicans, truth and facts become pointless. <br />Fantastic film with great acting by two guys I typically can't stand.  It is being unfairly pigeon-holed as \\"the gay cowboy movie\\" but it is so much more than that. <br />Besides, ALL cowboy movies are gay, this one is just honest about it.  I'm sick to death of that \\"John Wayne would never have made this movie\\" line I keep hearing.   <br />No, Marion WOULDN'T have made this movie because he wouldn't have wanted to be outted ;-)
B00008K78M|5.0|I bought this DVD along with the Live in Paris Limited Edition set, I have no words to express how satisfied I am, this dvd is one of the best concerts I've seen, It's incredible how powerful and perfect Laura's voice is, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to live a real concert.
0767803434|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, and although I do still like it, my subsequent viewings have found my love of this movie diminishing. Why? It has become too violent for me. I do like action movies like Die Hard, Braveheart, and Under Siege, but for some reason I find some of the violence disturbing and a bit gratuitous and that is not entertaining. Maybe Gary Oldman plays his character too well! There are too many scenes of summary executions and the unfairness of which leave me feeling a bit angry. The best example of that is when the President's Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel, played by Donna Bullock, is killed in cold blood in front of the Presidents wife and daughter. It is a very disturbing scene and a bit too much.<br /><br />Despite the violence the movie was a summer popcorn type of film that takes you on an adrenaline filled roller coaster ride of thrills and terror, and in that way it does succeed. Harrison Ford is excellent as the action-hero President. He is a strong yet human character who responds in heroic fashion under extraordinary circumstances. Gary Oldman plays the evil Ivan Korshunov only too well. The one performance that I find annoying is Dean Stockwell's portrayal of Defense Secretary Walter Dean. He doesn't come across as authoritative but rather almost childishly whinny. The movie does also go on a bit too long when the ending rescue is dragged out. Despite its flaws it is still a good action movie made even better by the performance of Harrison Ford.
B000002G6J|1.0|This CD contains some of the most annoying muzac I have ever heard.  All the songs sound pretty much the same... none without that put-me-right-to-sleep synthetic keyboard stuff.  I was disappointed, I  really was expecting to get alot of Brazilian flavor from this CD, it just didn't deliver for me.

B00005JOFO|5.0|This is one of those movies that stays with you, the characters are so real and the performances by the leads are unflinching, it's really quite extraordinary.  Ledger gives a performance that is so unexpected, I had read this short story before the movie came out and I just could not imagine him as Ennis, but he makes him come to life, but the performance that blew me away was Gyllenhaal's, his Jack Twist is so alive, he's the one willing to do anything to lead an authentic life, it is his performance that breaks your heart.  The direction and cinematography is spectacular.  As you watch the movie you can't help but think how much has changed...and sadly how much has not.  I hope if this movie does nothing else, it shows that what makes us all alike is our ability to love, we don't chose who to love, it choses us.
0684824906|5.0|The more things change, the more they stay the same. Lincoln was considered a simpleton, assailed by political enemies and the press  (including The New York Times) as obviously incapable of thinking for himself. There had to be a puppet master because Lincoln just couldn't be the author of the thoughts attributed to him. The Democrats were against doing anything that might offend the slaveholding South. Every policy proposed by Lincoln (or his alleged puppetmaster) was opposed by the Democrats. Sounds like today doesn't it? At their 1864 convention, the Democrats cheered the playing of \\"Dixie,\\" while remaining mute when Union songs were played.<br /><br />  Goodwin superbly recounts Lincoln's youth and early adult years as he learned the tricks of communicating with the ordinary person and, more importantly, developed the philosophies that would shape his life. Far from being the country bumpkin, Lincoln always sought public recognition through public office and Goodwin does well at putting this ambition in the context of the times and the different morality of the era. Not far removed from the Revolution, Americans still believed in the potential of their nation.<br /><br />  Goodwin's recounting of Lincoln's deft and masterful orchestrating of his campaign for the Presidential nomination of the newly formed Republican party is wonderfully detailed. Lincoln emerges as a skilled political operative who would not be at all out of place today. His nomination was anything but accidental.<br /><br />  Elected at the moment the nation was literally being pulled apart, Goodwin cuts to her primary theme: the ultimately brilliant move on Lincoln's part of appointing his most successful political rivals to his cabinet. Literally Lincoln adhered to the maxim of keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. But, as Goodwin, explains and thoroughly documents, Lincoln's shrewdness was brilliant. By  incorporating his rivals into his cabinet, he satisfied nearly all the various factions demanding a voice. The conservatives and the radicals and the center all were present in Lincoln's cabinet. Only the Democrats who wanted slavery to continue were unrepresented. The popular thinking of the time was the Seward, who was the favorite for the 1860 Republican nomination, would dominate the Cabinet and Lincoln.<br /><br />  But it didn't happen. Lincoln, as Goodwin explains, dominated his cabinet. While their advice was sought on occasion, Lincoln was the only voice that really mattered.<br /><br />  Goodwin goes to great lengths to describe Lincoln's empathy for the common person, for the millions affected by the Civil War. Her description of Lincoln is almost as lyrical and moving as Lincoln's own words, which Goodwin is not at all hesitant to use.<br /><br />  To her credit, Goodwin does nothing to deify Lincoln. She presents him as a man, a very unusual and gifted man who was also a masterful politician. Goodwin, indirectly, skillfully shoots down many myths about Lincoln.<br /><br />  This is a history for everyone with an interest in the development of the United States. Goodwin elevates her already glowing reputation to new heights with \\"Team Of Rivals.\\"<br /><br />Jerrythe various factions demanding a voice.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Point blank period. J Dilla was the best producer ever. DONE <br />No one can match his creativity..except catz like Hi-Tek, DJ Premier, and Pete Rock. <br /> <br />Dilla my dude RIP, <br />Lee-Diddy
B00005JNX0|4.0|Very funny-esp. if you live in thr tri-state area.  Not an elaborate plot line but enough one liners and great characters to make it a funny,light hearted, worth-the-watch movie!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Thank goodness Rent made it to the big screen. I hadn't been fortunate enough to see it until now. I will be the first to say that because of the subject matter (it is about a bohemian lifestyle, after all so what does one expect?) it's not for everyone. I would classify myself as fairly conservative -- conservative values, Christian, etc. and again, I classify Rent as an outstanding work. I cared about these characters without judgment and condemnation and challenge others who would avoid this movie because of the subject matter to be open-minded to the human beings (regardless of whether or not you agree with lifestyles, etc.). It has the potential to change your life, and increase your compassion toward others. That may sound a bit melodramatic, but it is true.<br /><br />OK...off my soap box.<br /><br />What a thrill it is for me to see this Broadway cast portray their very same roles on the big screen. The soundtrack is incredible (which I purchased after seeing the movie in the theater) as well. And be sure you don't miss thie extras as the deleted scenes (and alternate ending) are gems, but the true bonus is the 2-hour documentary about Jonathan Larson's life and the story of Rent. It's inspiring and heartbreaking. We can only imagine what else Jonathan would have gifted us with had he lived. Thank you Jonathan Larson!
B00004RF9B|2.0|One of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time is represented by one of the worst DVDs of all time. Forbidden Planet is a great movie, retelling Shakespeare's The Tempest in the Sci-Fi genre. Relief ship from Earth travels to a world to find two survivors of a colony settled over 20 years ago. An excellently arrogant Walter Pigeon has, through the use of alien technology, built for himself and his daughter, the beautiful Anne Francis, a virtual paradise, complete with robot servant and atomic-disposal. The \\"rescue\\" party, captained by a pre-silliness Leslie Nielsen disrupts the tranquility of their lives and unleashes the unseen monster which destroyed not only the other colonists, but also the alien civilization which had flourished here eons ago. The movie is still great 50 years after it was made. But this DVD is horrid. Being presented in a full screen format, in which the left or right side of scenes are cut off isn't even the worst of it. The quality of the picture is fuzzy and blurred. And as for extras? Forget it. If you've never seen this movie, then this is certainly not the way to do so for the first time.
