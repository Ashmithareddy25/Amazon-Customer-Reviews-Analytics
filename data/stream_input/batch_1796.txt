B00AF6B22E|4.0|After a series of mainstream action flicks, Denzel Washington stretches his acting chops again as Whip (really?) Whitaker, a seasoned pilot for a regional airline. Whip is so good at what he does, that he also manages to bed one of his flight attendants (stunning Nadine Velazquez) and gets plastered the night before seemingly without consequence.<br /><br />Hung over as he is, he straightens out by polishing off warm beer with a couple lines of cocaine as a chaser. I don't know if that works in the real world but it does for Whip. Some of the TV ads give the impression that Whip is a hero by pulling off a Sullenberger landing maneuver (he does) but is being hounded because of a small amount of alcohol was found in his system. Make no mistake this guy was hammered and should not be flying.<br /><br />Still with the help of a little vodka, he manages to control a doomed airliner saving the vast majority of the passengers. Unexpectedly once the NTSB/FAA begins their investigation, Whip feels invincible and doesn't slow down. Washington performance stands out of course. He plays a realistic drunk and seems to have all the facial tics, bobs and wrinkles on full throttle. Washington gets plenty of supporting help along the way. Kelly Reilly is a reformed druggie that gets involved with Whip after a hospital meet. Brian Geraghty is Whip's born again co-pilot. Tamara Tunie is the supervising flight attendant and longtime friend. Bruce Greenwood is Whip's union chief. Melissa Leo is the lead federal investigator. Don Cheadle is his lawyer and John Goodman brings some needed comedic relief as Whip's \\"Goodtime Charlie\\" supplier.<br /><br />It all works, including the great flight scenes leading up to the crash and some well-placed rock classics. Director Robert Zemeckis must be the go to director when it comes to simulating plane crashes. Remember the dizzying ocean ditch in \\"Cast Away?\\" \\"Flight\\" is a first class drama filled with excellent performances that follows an extraordinary opening sequence.dinary opening sequence.

B009E3EY38|5.0|Includes 2-CDs & DVD of rehearsals from 2007. The DVD runs nearly 2 hours and shows practice sessions a few days before the actual concert. The shots are filmed from a stationary camera at a distant location. There is no audience so the sound includes plenty of reverb and echoes. Essentially a waste of time. Just watch the Blu ray concert.  The 2 CD's replicate the concert song-for-song.<br /><br />Blu ray Concert:<br />When the founder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun died, the 3 Led Zep survivors (Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones) agreed to reunite after 27 years in what will likely be their final show together. The one time concert was performed December 10, 2007 at London's OZ Arena in front of about 18,000 fortunate fans.<br /><br />Added on drums was the late John Bonham's son Jason. While the boys have aged gracefully, they still have what it takes. From my perspective I saw little fall-off with perhaps just a bit lost from Plant's vocals. Certainly to be expected and in no way affected any of the songs. The set list is plentiful with 16 lengthy renditions including many of the best known as you would expect.<br /><br />I mean, if they only get together once, don't you want to hear \\"Ramble On,\\" \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" and \\"Rock and Roll,\\" (including the young Bonham's spot on finale that would make daddy proud)? This is a killer concert, beautifully directed by Dick Carruthers and features a terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio option.

B001O1O71C|5.0|This was a great book! It revealed the true happenings of the holocaust. I wish it didn't end so sad but that's what happens in the holocaust. Anyways, best book ever!
B004EHZPEG|5.0|This book is very interesting and well written.  I think the &#34;lenses&#34; approach is very good.  Many of the lenses are applicable to more than just games.  Much of the advice can not only help you be a great game designer, but it could also improve your understanding of life, people, psychology, the workings of the mind, and relationships as well.  Two thumbs up!
142311339X|5.0|I honestly have to say that I thought this book was a much better start compared to Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. The ground rules were already set from PJ and The Olympians series, so it was easy enough for Riordan to throw the reader directly into the action. At times, there was a lot explaining and background information on the 3 main leads, Jason, Piper, and Leo, but it also felt necessary in order to bring out the best and worst out of our heroes.<br /><br />Loved the action, fun, humour, and greek mythology!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|First off, you can't beat FREE! As far as it's functionality, it's been great. This was loaded onto a Kindle Fire & it fits the entire screen perfect. Easy to read & easy to use! Highly recommend this app to anyone.
1423140591|5.0|By far my favourite of all the Rick Riordan books I've read.<br /><br />It was nice to see Percy Jackson back in the Series, and I loved the two new characters Frank and Hazel which played a large part in The Son of Neptune and obviously a role in the prophecy.<br /><br />The beginning of this book reminded me of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. How so? The descriptions of Camp Jupiter was very similar to Camp HalfBlood. The demigods even played 'games' soon after arriving at camp. But besides that, the book takes on a different feel considering all our main characters are close to/at age 16. I felt Rick Riordan is only improving in his writing and plot. He continues to write wit and humour into each page, but now I felt an emotional attachement to our characters as well.<br /><br />A solid 5 stars from me and surprisingly has been added to my favourites list :D
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids & I play this app on occasion. Good for passing the time when waiting in a doctor's office, etc.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Velcro straps are adjustable for a good fit on the Baby Jogger City Mini.  My only issue is the 2 pockets for water bottles is a bit snug.  It seems to fit small water bottles fine, but anything bigger just wont do.  Still, very handy and convenient accessory for my stroller.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|our family loved this movie it was awsome. they all wanted to watch it again and again. We only are buying it

B00913P6G0|5.0|If you are not a Fan of hip hop, does not matter The music is great, he can sing (can hold a note and easy to listen too), and he can Rap.  He is one to watch out for!  'Real' is my favorite song this week, last week was 'Sing about me'.  I like the fact he is not trying to be anyone but who he is.  He should do a song with Frank Ocean.  The music is great, wish they had an instrumental version for each song, it's that good.  We will be hearing more from him, trust me.

B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Never a dull moment. Good insight to what running moon shine was like back in those days. I would recommend it.
1451613512|2.0|Very well researched and easy to read and understand.  However, it makes some 'liberal reaches' in terms of assumptions and conclusions.
B007V65R54|4.0|This is an easy read.  Silver does not dwell as much on statistical analysis as how they are used.  My one criticism is that he may be focusing too much on &#34;Money Ball&#34;.  Baseball is an easy game to gather individual statistics.  It would be much more difficult using football as the example.  For example, Seattle loses a great left guard and the quarterback's statistics go downhill fast.  Multivariate analysis is much harder to explain in simple sentences.

0143113100|4.0|The brain houses the secrets to our personality, our actions, and the disorders that can plague us if something goes wrong. In The Brain That Changes Itself, Dr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the University of Toronto, travels across America meeting with several scientists who have pioneered ground breaking research in neuroplasticity to demystify the enigma of the brain. He also interviews a variety of patients who once suffered from debilitating diseases stemming from the central nervous system, but with the work of these neuroplasticians, have overcome their illnesses. As we meet these people, Doidge provides a brief overview of the mechanisms gone wrong in each case. However, at the sake of comprehension, he has left out many of the details explaining how these events happen.<br /><br /> While detailing these miraculous triumphs of personal will and scientific study, Doidge also gives the history of how the way we think about the brain has progressed over time to the current model. Today we know that the brain can change, and in some cases rewire itself in response to damage, however, a majority of the experts interviewed in this book faced adversity from their locationalist counterparts. Locationists believed that each part of the brain carried out a specific function that could not be replaced, that the brain is hardwired in its pathways. Hardships for  plasticians came in several forms: rejected publications, lost grants and loss of reputation within the scientific community. Doidge recounts one of the most monumental experiments arguing for neuroplasticity in adults, performed by Dr. Merzenich in 1968. In his study, Merzenich cut the axons of adult monkeys running from the thumb and the index finger to the brain, and crossed them. After several months he saw that the brain had rearranged itself, as if the crossing had never occurred, something completely unexpected if the brain really was hardwired. However, upon publishing his paper, Merzenich's supervisor crossed out this discussion for plasticity calling it \\"too conjectural\\" and \\"going beyond the data.\\" The paper was published with no mention of plasticity and minimal emphasis on the reorganization of the brain. Merzenich, along with numerous other scientists, would have to wait for more data to convince their colleagues of the brain's malleability.<br /><br /> Fortunately, with years of research supporting life long changes in brain structure as well as organization, these previous hardships have been overcome in order to help stroke victims, people with autism and learning disorders, and rare neurological disorders. One of these disorders, caused by the antibiotic gentamicin, is the result of damage in the link between vestibular apparatus and visual system, an important pathway in the brain responsible for balance and orientation of our bodies in space. The patient, Cheryl, had only 2% of her vestibular apparatus functioning. Her field of vision was perpetually moving, she had the constant feeling of falling, and was incapable of standing on her own. She was left feeling mentally and physically exhausted from trying to control her body movements. With the help of neuroscientist Dr. Paul Bach-y-Rita, Cheryl's disorder was cured. This was done by substituting the visual sensory system with another sensory system, specifically the tongue. A strip containing electrodes is placed on the tongue and a metal hat containing a computer is worn. As the head is tilted forward the hat sends signals to the strip on the tongue to fire the electrodes towards the front of the mouth, as they fire at the back of the mouth when the hat is tilted backwards. This provides the brain with information about spatial orientation while taking a detour around the damaged vestibular system. Once the device is removed, a residual effect is still felt. This residual effect is initially felt for only a few minutes, however as the patient increases the amount of time wearing the device, the residual effects lengthen to hours and even weeks. Cheryl, who no longer needs to wear the device to feel its effects, would be one of the first to champion the leaps and bounds made in neuroplastic research.<br /><br /> Brain plasticity occurs not only in a physical sense, but also in a behavioral sense. Doidge walks us through the pathways that become reinforced by dopamine when exposed to certain rewarding addictions and anxiety disorders. In Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, one's anxieties become central to all other thoughts. This can result in cautionary rituals and fears tangential to the original anxiety. Using PET scans, studies show that areas associated with the activation, propagation, and termination of anxiety are all hyperactive in the brain of OCD patients. Many of these worries, such as unforeseen harm coming to themselves or a loved one, come from the activation and propagation parts of the pathway firing in response to what would normally be a sub-threshold stimulus, causing a false alarm. The goal of neuroplasticians is to unlink these areas of the brain to prevent unstimulated firing. To do this, Dr. Schwartz, a psychiatrist at UCLA, recommends that patients with OCD focus on a pleasurable activity for an extended period of time when they start to feel anxious. His research shows that this pleasurable activity redirects focus off of anxieties and lessens the anxiety-compulsion pathway as it is gradually used less. It also releases dopamine in the reward pathways, causing this circuit to be fired more often and reinforced over time. With continued use, the brain will rewire itself to release dopamine opposed to the anxiety pathway, lessening OCD symptoms, and allowing a patient to live a more normal life.<br /><br /> The Brain That Changes Itself earns 4/5 stars for Doidge's briefness on the mechanisms of neuroplasticity and his longwinded rambles regarding the history of this field. In the example of Cheryl's vestibular apparatus, he gives a basic overview of the damage done by the antibiotic gentamicin, and breaks down the function and pathway of the visual-vestibular system in laymen's terms. Doidge does these things, but he doesn't describe how gentamicin attacks this pathway, or how the receptors in the eyes and ears relay information to different areas of the brain. He describes Bach-y-Rita's electrode device, but not how the substitution of one sensory area for another builds a new pathway in the brain. In the OCD example, a brief summary is given of the brain, but further detailed information regarding the 'how' of neuroplasticity is omitted. The Brain That Changes Itself is written to target a wide audience of readers, of scientific and nonscientific backgrounds. It's understandable why these details are left out, as too much information can discourage readers altogether, however, Doidge could provide a little more depth to the topics he covers at no expense to his readers. The other problem with Doidge is that the majority of each chapter is dedicated to the background of each neuroscientist whose work is being examined. Most of Cheryl's chapter explains how Bach-y-Rita's first experiments were to help the blind 'see' with a device similar to the one to help Cheryl. The chapter then provides a detailed account of how Bach-y-Rita, initially a physician, showed interest in neuroplasticity after helping his father learn to walk after a stroke, which eventually lead him to create these devices to help people. The background of these scientists, although interesting, doesn't add to the story of each patient at hand, and Doidge seems to ramble at times. These two things together, the lack of detail and the drawn out background information, earn Doidge 4 stars for his otherwise well written book about the triumphs of neuroscience in the lives of people who have been affected by brain disorders for so long.<br /><br /> Doidge offers insight into different areas of neuroplasticity and how many people have benefitted from the ongoing research. The Brain That Changes Itself is written so that the reader understands the disorders these patients have struggled with for so long, and the amount of personal will it took to overcome them. We also sympathize with the scientists in this field after learning of the adversity they faced trying to change the way we think about the brain. However, Doidge focuses too much over the history of the men and women who have revolutionized the field, and too little over the mechanisms of plasticity. Despite this, I would recommend this book to broaden one's knowledge of how science continues to benefit those in need.

0002247399|5.0|George RR Martin's epic, ambitious series `A Song of Ice and Fire' has to be the closest creation to JRR Tolkien's work; for he has shown us such a creation that one could only dream of producing. This mammoth tale concludes with the largest book I have ever held within my hands (being 1,016 pages long), that took me quite a few months to read. This grand epic saga has literally raised the bar high within its genre, for many authors to aim to aspire to and which many are overwhelmed as it was not thought possible. Full of intensity, electric tension and nail-biting suspense this book is one to completely and utterly loose yourself within and which pulls you in; reminiscent of bait being lured into a tantalizing trap. Caught in a tangled web of interconnecting threads, your mind will still be lost within the pages long after finishing reading this book. The sheer scale on which George RR Martin has achieved this assumed to be impossible feat, Is just mind-boggling and which really does blow you away instantly. Many other fantasy writers have taken one look at `A song of ice and fire' and have turned away shaking their heads in disbelief, as they never thought it possible to have accomplished so much.<br /><br />To construct the twelve Caesars of fantasy fiction is astonishing, and his well-crafted characters and world-building on such a scale is astounding. This colossal, epic, staggering series and concluding novel is just temptation itself and a delight for all fans of the fantasy genre who really want to `stick their teeth' into something complex and compelling. Capturing the intricacy of Middle-Earth with such vivid detail and history, with character-driven narrative that is as brutal and bloodthirsty as Conn Iggulden's series about Caesar; this is a masterful tale. Etched within your memory for all-time this imaginary world will become part of your own world, as you re-visit it time & time again.<br /><br />The future of the seven kingdoms hangs in the balance, as on all sides bitter conflicts are reigniting which are played out by a band of outlaws and priests, soldiers, nobles and slaves. In the East fearsome Dragons rule the skies with the kingdom below built upon dust and death is plagued by deadly enemies...The Dwarf Tyrion Lannister seeks out the Dragons as you travel to the North and the great wall of ice & stone, where the wildling armies wait for an assault....<br /><br />The tides of destiny are slowly but surely washing in and coming closer...closer to the end of all things.as on all sides bitter conflicts are reigniting which are played out by a band of outlaws and priests, soldiers, nobles and slaves.

0316226424|5.0|Since Bella made her decision and chose to marry Edward Cullen her fate was sealed, as the fantasy of being irrevocably in love with a Vampire all too soon becomes a nightmare that is woven into a dangerously heightened reality.  Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen and in another by her deep connection to Werewolf Jacob Black, this final installment is full of temptation, loss and strife to reach the ultimate goal that almost seems impossible to touch. It is her final choice between the world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life that has become the reason from which the fate of two tribes both hang, and so shocking results ensue that will have you crying out in astonishment.  A startling chain of unprecedented events transpire which are potentially devastating and which threaten all that Bella holds most dear. The life of those whom she loves cherishes and cares for, including her daughter Esme all come under threat as the great battle of a long time between the Volturi, Werewolves and Vampires (including the Cullen&iexcl;¦s) takes place.  All that Isabella has striven for in life is now under threat of being lost forever, and those frayed stands of her life that she discovered in Twilight, and which were torn in New Moon and Eclipse, and which she has now pieced together could be destroyed forever. This remarkable, astonishing and captivating final installment in one of the most spectacular YA series I have ever encountered, finally comes to its eagerly anticipated ending. Breaking Dawn does truly highlight what captured the hearts of millions of readers with the spellbinding, passionate romantic epic; that is worthy of remembrance just as equal to Shakespeare&iexcl;¦s Romeo & Juliet.<br /><br />Glued to the page I was unable to tear my eyes away as Bella fought her last battle and ultimately one which spoke of her heart, professing the lengths that one goes to for true love and how powerful an emotion it really is. This impressive series is one that I will re-read time and time again, and which you can really &iexcl;¥stick your teeth into&iexcl;¦ and get lost within a complex and dramatic saga that is riveting, and of such staggering epic scope.<br /><br />I cannot enthuse enough about an author whose series has captured my heart and soul and which I know like other great works of fiction that I love (i.e. Harry Potter series for an example), will stand the test of time due to the inspired narrative. Stephanie Meyer&iexcl;¦s writing is so beautiful and poignant, being a writer who  puts herself and her own originality, unique flair, style and her own personality, ideals and thoughts into her writing together with such emotion that is quite powerful and effecting can thus be met with such conflicting opinions. This beautiful Vampire love story has really embedded itself within my heart, never to be removed, and my only regret is that I did not read Stephanie Meyer&iexcl;¦s work sooner, and I am now delighted to say that I am a devoted (and slightly obsessed fan) of The Twilight Saga!! It is just AMAZING and I really do urge you to take a look at this series for each book is as well-written, gripping and as fantastic as the previous one with Breaking Dawn being the most electrifying, intense and thrilling conclusion EVER!! I was literally falling off my chair with such enthusiasm and excitement, eager to get to the end and yet not wanting it to end. If I could give this series more than a five star rating then I would for it is truly tremendous and mind-blowing.<br /><br />You HAVE to read this series as it is incredible!!! ºes is one that I will re-read time and time again, and which you can really ¡¥stick your teeth into¡¦ and get lost within a complex and dramatic saga that is riveting, and of such staggering epic scope.<br /><br />I cannot enthuse enough about an author whose series has captured my heart and soul and which I know like other great works of fiction that I love (i.e. Harry Potter series for an example), will stand the test of time due to the inspired narrative.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|I liked the way they projected them power in this movie, to give viewers the impression, they'em is in charge.  A slick<br />propaganda movie and fun, too.  Smith is maturing into<br />a fine actor, I hope to see more of him, but he's got to drop<br />that attitude for a fetch boy or look down his nose at them<br />poor folks  Every movie has a moment, to attack them and that is a real turn off.  But, all in all, a real good movie to watch and well worth the price.  I won't call it racist, but it had overtones of it.  It distracts from him and I'm sure he is not like that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. Just...wow. Scary to think how this could actually be some ones screwed up life. I have seen criticism of the ending, but I thought it was appropriate considering the overall plot.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|More useable recipes than you normally get with cookboks.  The whole famiky enjoys the recipes!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this resource  to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Groan inducing cliché even M. Night Shyamalan might face palm over. Someone name dropped Dan Simmons so I had different expectations. City of Ember this is not.
B00004U8JV|4.0|My grandson is a young paleontologist.  Loves dinosaurs and knows everything about them all. I bought it for him to add to his collection
B004GJDQT8|3.0|well i got this on my tablet and i will have to say that it is alright. the one thing that gets to me is that it does not give me the option to use the super saver shipping. i had enough and my products showed i could use it but it was not an option when i was about to purchase.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This movie is one of the best ever made. Pretty much every one knows this, and even if someone doesn't agree, they know that pretty much everyone else thinks so. This being the case, I don't think it's too necessary to discuss the film's merits.<br /><br />All three films look amazing. The best they ever have. The first DVD release was a huge improvement in picture quality and clarity over the VHS, and this Blu-ray takes it even further.<br /><br />The picture looks perfect. For years, the image was murky, and a bit too dark, but here it is brought back to the way it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />Now, I know no one likes The Godfather Part III, and because of this, some people may instead opt to go for the standalone versions of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II in order to save a few bucks. But, considering the wealth of special features, most of which are not available on the standalone sets, the extra few dollars for this set is worth it.<br /><br />The only thing I wish this set has was the edited-for-TV version of The Godfather Parts I & II, as it would be cool to sometimes have the option to watch those two movies in chronological order.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great set.
B007HLIUN4|5.0|A most provocative argument. Although many elements in this analysis have been presented before, the focus on institutional development has been well argued. An absolutely essential read!
B0048LPRD2|5.0|I think it'd be pretty safe to say you've never really seen a movie like this.<br /><br />Switching between first and third person viewpoints, and utilizing crazy colors throughout, this movie is definitely unique.<br /><br />The movie looks great on blu-ray, and this disc has the sixth reel included in the film, which was removed during it's theatrical run (though it did appear in some special screenings).
0374275637|2.0|I got this because I heard the author's interview on NPR and was intrigued since I love Economic & Psychology. But I found this book to be too technical at the beginning.  Maybe I need to skip the first few chapters and read more about the author's implications of his study.  I'll have to skip around but mostly, I found the author's writing a bit dry and academic. I wish academics would write in a more commonplace language so that they can influence the public laypersons in business and politics instead of their academic peers. We really need better informed laypersons in our society so that research like this can broaden their understanding of our psyche and our world. Unfortunately this author fails to make this subject clear, at least initially. I'll try to skip around and read more but this author can make reading difficult sometimes.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I found this book to be a marvelous and rich description of a mystical place that everyone should be lucky enough to visit in their lifetime.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This album has less bass & drums then previous Coldplay albums but after listening through the entire album, I fell in love with the sounds and melodies. You have to listen to the entire album from beginning to end to get a true feel for the songs. It will disappoint you if you skip around to individual songs. I think Coldplay challenged their fair-weather fans with this album because the lyrics & rhythms aren't as catchy as previous albums. But I'm glad I believed in Coldplay's work and gave this album a chance by buying it. It's really good and I hope others will give it a chance also even though it didn't have strong radio play. I don't know what Coldplay will do next. I think I will buy their next album even if it doesn't produce a hit because I love Coldplay. They are a genuine & quality band. I also buy U2, Pet Shop Boys and Erasure albums no matter what the critics & radio says about their new work. It's sad when the public only notices a band initial radio hits and doesn't notice their continued quality work in future albums. I don't know why radio has such a short attention span. There are great songs out there that only the band's fans know about. I'm sure there are great songs out there buy other older artists that I don't know about because radio never plays their new stuff. I've found myself hearing new Pet Shop Boys songs in grocery stores and I get surprised but I'm glad someone still notices.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As they say &#34;patience is a virtue&#34; and it really paid off with the latest installment in the Mitch Rapp series.  Set in the present day, Mitch is called upon to boldly go and crack some skulls as only he can.  However, this time Mitch may not only be the hunter...<br /><br />A great, quick read that delivers to the fans, new and long term, with the classic bravado, cut the red tape, God Bless America, that we all love him for.  Keep them coming Mr. Flynn.
B007NWCZR4|2.0|I really liked Alternative album of their early b-sides through 1990 or so.  I thought this collection of b-side material would also be good but I was disappointed.  And PSB usually never disappoint me.  I only found 3 new tracks that I liked on the whole 2 cd set.  I already had How I Learned to Hate Rock & Roll, Delusions of Grandeur, and The View from Your Balcony.  The new tracks I liked were We're the Pet Shop Boys and Blue On Blue.  The other tracks are not very catchy & my attention wasn't kept long enough for me to judge the lyrics.  The songs are much more personal than what was on PBS Alternative so I can't relate to the songs.  Unless you are a big fan of Neil, I recommend downloading the above individual tracks from Amazon or iTunes.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|FOLLETT AT HIS BEST. EASY TO FOLLOW AND REALLY GIVES YOU AN IDEA WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE AT THIS PERIOD.<br />PRETTY AUTHENTIC
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great to see this stunning work without others coughing, smoking e-cigarettes or other distractions.  The extras on the main disc are great, need to watch the second one next.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I love my Star Wars Calendar. Its pretty awesome.  The instructions for each model are on the back of the little flap you pull out each day.  If you want to go online to unlock the codes you have to go to [...] then click the advent calendar.  It has a place you enter the codes each day and get a fun little animation.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome my little one read it in two days, and I am glad that was able on kindle, because we are living in Europe and we have to wait a lot to get the books over here....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it!  Keeps you on your toes all the way til the end !!!  First<br />Series of books I've read in ages !
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is my second time playing thru this game. It takes awhile to get all the way, & can b quite challenging to get all the little pieces to fall where you want them to. I just wish my other all-time favorite by this developer (Fishdom) was also available for my 'smart' phone! I was really sad when I finished that adorable game (the fish sending little hearts to you for something in their tank is too cute!!). Unfortunately, it's only avail for Nintendo's ds or the Kindle Fire (I have both & much prefer the superior graphics on the KF. Besides, there's no hearts on the Ninrendo ds version! (-;  BTW, I also have to comment on the BEAUTIFUL graphics...in BOTH games!! Good job Playrix!! More please!!
B009LRE040|2.0|these days almost everything from hollywood is a disappointment.  every now and then a film surprises you.  after watching the trailer when it first came out...i thought this would be one of them.  it wasn't.  when u consider its massive budget and hype...this film falls flat on its face.  the characters are underdeveloped.  i couldn't relate or identify with any of them.  i know i know...it is a superhero film but really. blake...really?  the film was anti climactic and flat.  the action sequences were blah.  the sound effect were a joke.  watch a film like aliens (1986). almost 30 years old and compare these two films.  u won't be able to because dkr does't come even remotely close to matching up.  comic book nerds are gonna hate on this review and i really don't care. if u like this film then u like it.  i don't and feel its a mediocre form of entertainment that i will never watch again.  in hollywood...is all about money...understandable.  if your gonna spend that kind of money to produce a film...can't u at least produce something decent?
B005V5WBFG|2.0|I bought Mcafee's \\"all access protection\\" software from mcafee.com, and I was lead on to believe it was simple & protecting all of your devices... How very wrong I was! This app offers you protection that costs $30 a month just to use on supported mobile devices. But one might assume that it's better to buy protection for all of your devices in one neatly tied package... wrong! It will work on your phones but causes your kindle to force close so many times it'll make you head spin. Mcafee needs to update their app asap.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Too slow and plodding. Character development weak.<br />Not recommended for any regular Grisham reader...unless this is the first Grisham experience..
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Easy to get lost in the story of these characters.  The end is a<br />wonderful reminder of the meaning of life itself
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have all the versions and this is the best version by far!  Can't wait for future releases to come out.
0061969664|4.0|The story of Uhtred continues in Death of Kings.  More intrigue, deceit, Danish invasions, and epic battles.  As Alfred is dying and the Danes are plotting yet another invasion, Uhtred once again rallies Wessex to defend it's borders.  I have recently become engrossed with this series.  Bernard Cornwell continues to find new plots and characters that make this series one of my favorite historical fiction series.  The only regret I have about this book is that Cornwell has not written book 7 in the series.
B008S80P38|1.0|Piece of poo<br />Deadmau5 has done much better albums than this piece of under mediocrity.There are like three good songs on this album, the vedlt, sleepless and take care of the paperwork.If you want a good electronic artist listen to Cosmic Gate, Armin Van Buuren, ATB or Ferry The artists I just mentioned won't waste your time and/or money because their music is more than just old songs from 1980\\"s movies being remixed (AKA. Closer-Encounters of the third kind) and their music is more than just some jazzy drum loop channel 42.Now I pray to god that the world will start listening to the artists I mentioned earlier on instead of this low level artist.P.S the people who listen to this guys music need fake ID's to get in, at least the people who go to a state of trance are above 18.
B004V45YBG|1.0|Dry, disconnected.  I didn't get it at all.  Not an easy read, difficult to understand the point the author was making.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like it but I'm still too new at it.  Still trying to figure out the best and fastest way to use it.
B0012F9VS4|5.0|This book is perfect for my grandson.  He's having a baby sister soon and this book makes it easy for him to understand
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Not your typical horror film. If you have not seen it, please do yourself a favor and watch this movie you wont regret it.
1878424114|5.0|I have read many of Chopra's books and he is truly insightful and inspired. But, this is the book I return to over and over. It is simple yet provides a clear and wonderful guide for successful living. I have probably purchased twenty copies over the years as I have given many away to people who are embarking on a spiritual journey and looking for some guidance. My only criticism is the placement of the chapters. The first chapter is a bit abstract and beginners tend to get lost (I did when I first read the book many years ago and almost put it down t that point). I tell people to start with chapter two and finish with chapter one. The book deserves five stars regardless.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|Daniel Craig once again reprise his role as 007, James Bond, in pursuit of the men responsible for the death of the woman he loved. As portrayed by Craig, this James Bond is a complex character caught between a natural desire for revenge and loyalty to the British Secret Service. There's plenty of action, for those who need it, but this is definitely an adults only, action movie.
0307887898|5.0|Great way of thinking about things...  A much needed book for many industries, not just tech.  The followers of this approach are pretty passionate about it.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Bought this so my kids could see where the &#34;Bubba Gump Shrimp Company&#34; restaurant came from, and so they could see what life was like in the South where I grew up.
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|Kid loves it, it is just expensive...  A lot of the stuff isn't really recognizable...  I look at what it tells me it is, then I look at the lego version and I'm like, Really?  Some of the models could be much better with a few more pieces, but they cut back on the number of pieces this year and some of the models are really small.  (e.g. yesterday it was the MMT...  I had no clue what it was and had to look it up at which point I didn't see any resemblance.<br /><br />Next year is going to be tough for them... you can tell they are really running out of ships this time around.
B0099114WO|2.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones; has to be a winner, right?  Wrong.  This movie was not entertaining, funny, touching, sweet, or hopeful.  Rather than eliciting sympathy, empathy, or general feelings of tenderness towards Streep's character, Kay, and her plight, Kay's one dimensional meekness elicited nothing but irritation.  And what was the deal with Arnold?  Did I miss something or did he never reveal why he became a stodgy, complaining, dissatisfied grouch?  Steve Carell's performance as the warm and caring Dr. Feld was the one saving grace of the movie.  Even that isn't reason enough to watch it.  Sadly, I can not recommend this dud.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Can't get enough of the Walking Dead Series. Included in this package is a six webisodes of how the Bicycle Girl came about. This worth more than the price os this disk.
B004TACMZ8|3.0|I thought it would work as good as the Bosch video. It works the same as the $20 one I got from Home Depot.
B009SQRL4U|2.0|If you have a 4 or 5 year old they will enjoy this movie.  Adults, not so much. Ah well, it's Christmas.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Good to kill time. Hated raising volume for scenes when they whisper then seconds later I felt I was going through an apocalypse.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|This is part of a Christmas present for my daughter so it has not been watched yet. I just wanted to say how happy I was with the  shipping from the Company from the time I ordered to when it arrived! Very nice job, and right at my front door!<br /><br />With that being said I really think there shouldn't be any problems with anything! I can't wait until she opens it thanks so much!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is one of those that is hard to put down.  In the beginning, it seems like a story cut out of the headlines, but then comes the twist!  It is an interesting tale of how difficult it is to really know someone and how lives become so entangled.
0671646788|5.0|Purchased for my grandson recommended by my Pastor for him.  My grandson loves this and will treasure it also.  I wil probably read it myself at my grandson's recommendation
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn always does a great job. has the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat. Wish that this was more true to life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love love love. I'm on this site all the time.  The ideas are awesome. I am hooked for life. love it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Just buy it!!! It grows on you fast. The end of the movie with River was AWESOME!!! Probably my favorite TV series ever.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|Can't be any better for me. I have never been good about keeping so many different passwords and eventually settled on one password for all my sites. Not a good idea. Ran across 1Password and installed it on my Mac. Wow...the app is so simple and easy to use. Sure, there were moments when I got stuck and unsure what to do next, but got instant help from Agilebits every time. The app provides a variety of services, but the most useful for me has been the ability to create a diverse password for each of my sites with the help of the app and then get instant access to any of those sites with just one &#34;click.&#34;<br />I bought a second app for my Kindle Fire HD. It was awesome to have the app sync to my Mac and have an instant second 1Password in perfect working order on my Kindle.<br />I recommend very highly 1Password.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The fact that people still talk about it a decade + later is proof. I won't waste time with my interpretation. If you're hear reading reviews you've heard of the show. JUST BUY IT!!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I've seen some really good film restorations, but this one was truly breathtaking. The difference was noticeable as soon as the film started and the camera panned over the beautiful views of Austria's mountain side. I heard birds chirping, which I don't recall before. Was that added to the soundtrack or had it always been there? In any case, I could hear the full depth and complexity on my surround sound.<br /><br />Then Julie Andrews appeared on screen and I was stunned. The clarity and crispness made the movie look like something that had been filmed in more recent years. The restoration is just perfect. It isn't grainy, yet it isn't overly glossy like some restorations that I've seen ruined when they tried to clean it up too much.<br /><br />I'm not sure what was done, but it's perfect. The hills truly are alive with the sound of music with this 45th anniversary edition. The movie is a treasure and has been given the treatment it deserved to preserve it. Well done.
030758836X|4.0|I don't know where to start with the review for this book...but I will say \\"I loved it!\\" I don't want to provide spoilers in this review so I'll do the best I can to review it in a way that doesn't ruin the experience.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book most of all because it wasn't predictable. A mystery that I can't figure out is rare and one that I can't figure out AND isn't completely ridiculous, even better. I found myself loving characters, hating characters and questioning every little detail. At first I thought it was just a book about marriage and relationships. Then I also wondered if the author was making a comment about the world of public opinion and how it impacts our justice system. I also love that it has a few parts that were laugh out loud funny to me.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars was the ending. It felt incomplete and I'll leave it at that.
1451695195|5.0|After seeing Dr. Alexander on TV discussing his NDE (near death experience) I wanted to know more and ordered his book ASAP.  I found it fascinating and felt his words are a gift to those who read it.  The only drawback for me was the scientific and medical language used, which, of course, I have no knowledge.  BUT, it certainly gives one hope about the  hereafter, especially coming from an indivudal such as Dr. Alexander who had little belief in spiritual matters.  Very impressive!
0142410349|5.0|Recieved the book with no flaws and feel like its already a classic in my library.  Thanks for everyting and have a good day
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am only able to view like 7 status and then it stops and won't reload.... Really not happy with this FB version
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|While the movie is great, the digital copy is terrible.  The image quality is atrocious, I could probably rip a better copy of the SD disc.  Get the movie, even get it on blu-ray, but don't bother paying extra for the digital copy.
B009EAALII|5.0|great quality in sound and picture. a must for any chris isaak fan or a fan of the memphis style
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|This item is subpar in comparison to the Hipe 3 LED Automatic Motion-sensing Directional Night Light - Battery Powered Hallway Light with a Built in Motion and Light Sensor.  Buy that one!<br /><br />The cover on the back of this model was very loose when it arrived an caused issues.  The motion sensor failed after a couple weeks of use and it is a pain to turn the unit on and off with the small, poorly made switch.  The Hipe 3 is a much better quality product and I would rate that 4-5 stars! I bought three of them and they are working great after a few months use.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I have had the movie as a vhs for several years. I was happy to find it in a dvd.
B005LAIGLO|1.0|It just came with the Blue Ray and DVD. Do not buy this movie if you want the digital copy.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I have had a hard time finding movies for halloween that are not over the edge for the kids.<br />This movie has always been a classic.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great Book, I have book 1 - 5 now. Already finished it and waiting for book 6<br /><br />Quality was good, no complaints at all.
0792164903|5.0|This is a great movie, very well done. I have watched it several times.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This App has all the functions I need and more. Installs easy and I set the updates to automatic so it is always updated.
B001HN694K|5.0|I love Johnny Depp movies and was not disappointed with this one.<br />I would recommend it to everyone. It was in great condition upon arrival.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I grew up with the Muppets and have always loved them, even though they've made some questionable movies (see all of the 90's).. This movie blew them all away (even the Muppet's Christmas Carol).  Not only is it my new favorite Muppet movie of all time, it's definitely made a solid place in my top 5.
B00846TTDG|4.0|After I watched this movie I went online and checked the IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes reviews for it. I was shocked and angered at the stupid, moronic reactions to the movie and that so many had given it a low rating.<br />It seems like this was driven by people thinking the acting was bad which is absurd. There is no weakness in the acting. It is solid from beginning to end and one could name many hollywood blockbusters that acting inferior to this film.<br />It also seems like these negative reviews are driven by hollywood elitist movie critics who were trying to read allot of political messages into the movie and saw it as propaganda or a recruiting film. This shows a complete and utter misunderstanding of the movie. The movie was motivated by a sense of patriotism and the desire to honor the men and women who serve at the most elite levels of the military. But it seems many people cannot see that. Such patriotism is lost on them.<br />Situations like these continue to reinforce the weakening of my faith in humanity and society today.<br />People have had such absurd reactions to this movie. It just makes me angry. These negative, bizarre off the wall reaction seem quite prevalent among many people and it's just disgusting.<br /><br />But anyway, back to the movie. It is a realistic, well directed depiction of Navy Seals and the roles they play. It was amazing to see how mobile they are and the advanced technology they use when deploying or extracting from operations. I think some people can't comprehend the realism of the movie because it is not a unrealistic free-wheeling, hyper-active hollywood film that do quite forceful things to stir peoples emotions.<br />The realism of combat is as absolute as you can get in a movie. The action is portrayed how it would actually occur. Perhaps some people don't know what to do with this. They can't handle the truth or don't want to.<br />But for any level headed person with even ounce of patriotism and a tolerance for action,this movie should be very enjoyable and moving.<br />A great movie with a noble message. Let's support this film and subvert the hand of those hollywood elitists.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|I brought this since I don't have an Apple TV and didn't care about wi-fi. I have an iPhone 4S. Apparently this is an old version and it doesn't work with iPhone or later.<br />So far I haven't had any problems. The only thing is that it doesn't come out as 16:9 but the same iPhone screen. This makes sense. If you don't mind, you can buy the Apple DIgital AV Adapter newest version than this. Overall they are better than any other version since it has a port to charge your iDevice.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|What can we say,<br /><br />But we LOVE the LOVE Album of The Beatles.<br /><br />It is a continuous mix of all Beatles Songs gelled together and transitions from one song to the next flawlessly.<br />There are Surprise songs, rare songs and variations of the originals. If you love the Beatles and are looking<br />for something NEW FROM THE BEATLES in a way this is for you ENJOY!
B009VB97EY|2.0|there's not enough story to keep this movie together. The guys are hot and the dance scenes are well choreographed but that's about all.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I love this movie. I actually ordered the VHS by mistake so now I have to formats. Get copy quality.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This is a very good read.  It's refreshing to hear Dr. Alexander outline his experience from a medical perspective in many cases using line-by-line and precept-by-precept scientific justification.  As an Evangelical Christian, my core criticism is that Christ is not central to his experience in the after life. Hence my disappointment in the book.  It is otherwise a good thought provoking book for those who believe this natural life is all there is.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Post climatic, as must be all series. Otherwise a good conclusion. As good as the first books.<br />,could lead to another series in a later time set.
1616960922|5.0|With a mile-long &#34;to do&#34; list running through my head, I came home from work, threw my jacket on the couch, and entered my room. My eyes fell on this package lying innocently on the bed. I could do all of those things tomorrow, right? I read the novella in less than a day (practically in one sitting) and my only regret was that it was over so soon.<br /><br />As a fantasy reader of 20 years and a bit of a book snob (I admit it) I take my hat off to Brandon Sanderson. He rekindles the sense of wonder I used to experience at age 10, curled up in a corner and reading about dragons.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love this set. I'm not interested in paying a fortune for the limited edition stuff. I bought this at pre-sale and the price made it an even better deal. I couldn't resist.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love Love Love this show.  Love the characters. The actors make you feel for them and understand why they do the things they do even though they are wrong.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Fun continuation of the Heroes of Olympus story. Develops some of the lesser known characters and grows the established ones.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't usually do reviews on books but I must say this book was amazing.  I highly recommend it if you like this type of book!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love that he puts a Rod Stewart zing in it! This will be playing on Christmas day at least twice!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Their videos are amazing.  I voce the locations they choose to shoot their videos.  Their music is beautiful, yet energetic.  Don't pass them up!
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Mark Twain, have not read since grammar school. It brings back memories, of when it was read.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my fiancé, who is a bass player and he LOVED IT:). The price was great and the product was in perfect condition!  I was very pleased and recommend this product to anyone who enjoys these musicians:)
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragon story is a fun game where you build their homes. Raise and breed them with other types like a forest dragon to a fire dragon and see what you get. I haven't spent any real money. You can earn gold by having friends. I just wish I could play offline when playing somewhere without Internet service. Otherwise it's wrung game!!
B002EY1VVW|3.0|My favorite Coldplay album!!!!!<br /><br />Til Kingdom Come is my favorite ever!<br /><br />The only downside is that even though they put the used CD in a new case, the new case was cracked when I received it. Big disappointment.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really like this game because it has the best graphics of all the dragon games. Also, I never give up and buy a dragon because the game has been good to me and I usually get my goal even if it takes a few tries,  just have to be patient. When I can hardly wait for an egg to be ready then I get gold but I think it is a reasonable price range. I am very satisfied and play every day. Morning, noon, and night!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I got this whole album because it wasn't much cheaper then getting just one song (Ho Hey)<br /><br />And the whole thing is amazing. I like Dead Sea, Flowers in your hair, Big parade..... Most of them on there!!! :D
1476715904|5.0|Hoover wrote a book, that ripped me apart from the beginning to the very end. I am almost positive that I have never cried this much before in my life with a book. Towards the end I had to keep putting the book down because each word was tearing me up inside. And I loved every second of it. The book was an absolute delight to read.<br /><br />I cannot imagine what all Layken and Will had to go through. Finding that perfect love at first sight only to never be able to see how it could fully develop due to cirmcumstances beyond their control: torture. Hoover you gave us readers a story wrote to perfection; a story I quickly became obsessed with. Putting it down was near impossible...too much goodness flowing through the book to even want to. Kudos, Hoover, for making one hell of a read. Now I am moving on to book 2, Point of Retreat.<br /><br />So yes, please go out now and GET.THIS.BOOK. You will love it I kid you not. But be forewarned tears will be flowing and snot will be snotting. Stock up on tissue...I hear Costco has them on sale.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This is a great feel-good movie! Justin Timberlake is really a jack of all trades. I really watch this movie over and over.
B008602KQI|5.0|think the movie represents or symbolizes the current state of the nation - people whose rights are slowly eroded and blinded by a government who distracts them with materialism until they are awoken by a single moment of clarity
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|i was sceptical at first but the graphics arr great and its game play is terrific. I cant wait for the game to get better ..yarr
0141033576|5.0|This book is a must read. The material is fascinating and the writing excellent. Daniel Kanhemann is the father of Behavioral Economics and distills in this book a &#34;lifetime's worth of wisdom&#34; as Steven Levitt puts it.
0375507256|2.0|What a difficult read! So far we haven't finished and are so bored we probably won't. Oh well, win some, lose some.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|After a 15 year hiatus, these Seattle post-metal grungemeisters rock it out on their 6th album<br />  since 1988.  There's more than a touch of cranked-up Stoner rock energy here, as Cornell belts<br />  out the rockers with the unbridled passion of someone much younger, while Thayil's guitar fills<br />  the gaps with some epic, ripping leads.  \\"King Animal\\" has the feel of a classic stadium hard rock<br />  album.  It may not be the band's most memorable moment, but it's a more than respectable<br />  return.  Members have played in Pearl Jam, Temple Of the Dog, Audioslave, Wellwater<br />  Conspiracy, Skin Yard.  Reminiscent of Alice In Chains, the Cult, Screaming Trees.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I was pretty impressed that this season bounced back after i was let down last season. However seeing the last 5 seconds of season 6 before i had watched any of it really pissed me off. I mean seriously who was the genius that thought that was a good idea. On a side note does anyone know what song was playing during the spoiler of the century showtime commercial.
B008O9V24W|4.0|London band returns with their 2nd album of melodic guitar pop that mixes the Brit-pop stylings of<br />  their debut with a more roots-based, 50s twang guitar edge.  Influences from the Beatles, Ash,<br />  the Raveonettes, Stratford 4, Mas Rapido, Surfer Blood, the Strokes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not be more pleased with this book. The characters are compelling and the storytelling is immersive and exciting. I've already purchased First Shift -Legacy and can't wait to dig into it. I have not been this excited about reading in years.
B009P13RQY|5.0|5th album from Austin, Texas rockers--Stoner marching metal with big, tight, crunchy power<br />  chords, classic old-school ripping rhythms and punchy, potent lead riffs.  Mystical, foreboding<br />  sci-fi lyrics lead a melodic & muscular doom-blast of air guitar/devil sign hard rock ecstasy.<br />  Seriously fun head-banging, hair-shaking metal that sounds like the real deal!  Shades of Kyuss,<br />  Queens Of the Stone Age, Dozer, Thin Lizzy, Helmet, Torche, Iron Maiden.
B007THA4FI|5.0|was a great read. never read any of the harry potter books but i can understand why they were so popular.the way the book ended i hope there is another book in the offing
B002E01MHY|3.0|So out of Maniac,Prowler and NY Ripper I've come to the conclusion that NY ripper is the top contender at 3.5 stars.<br />Now obviously two things are needed to make these movies a success on is nudity and over the top kills.<br />This movie has enough of both to satisfy most.<br />Maniac left me baffled as how can anybody think it's ground breaking stuff. (maybe back then but this movie is only a year older and much better as far as I'm concerned)<br />And Prowler was not even half the movie I thought it would be.<br />That being said this is decent enough to merit three and a half stars.<br />It's the closest to what I think a clasic sleazy slasher flick should be like.<br />Of course it's all objective as the varying review ratings will atest it's just this one had more of what I have come to expect from an 80's slasher flick.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent reading to warm up your relationship. Impossible to put it down! If you haven't read in a while, this is a good option to take up reading again!

B009KHDT0C|4.0|Barnabas was always the vamp you sympathized with. In this movie as well it happens. But Depp injects enough kitschy, fun things to make this an enjoyable romp.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have found an author I like better than Flynn.<br /><br />Lee Childs. He also has a rough and tumble guy, but his writting keep you on edge and he is not as predictable.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The plot was typical. The fun references, and cameos brought a chuckle. And enough violence to take the edge off after a frustrating day at work.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Childs can really crank out an intriging tale that keeps you hooked througout. Make sure you start with the #1 of his books called the Killing Floor. Then you will be blown away with Die Trying.<br /><br />The only negativ thing I have to say is that he seems obsesced with the word &#34;shrugged.&#34; It is used way too often. &#34;he shrugged...she shrugged...they shrugged...etc....ad nausium.<br /><br />I am getting ready to read the third book Tripwire.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|The psychological transformation Tilda goes thru is a great piece of work. The characters are very well played, and you empathize with her thru the entire movie.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Cute and quirky take on how technology has affected how Santa delivers gifts.  Three generations of Santas consider the reason they work so hard all year to deliver gifts to the world's kids.  GranSanta is worth watching all alone.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|In fact, everything these guys do is great. Watch all their videos, too. The music is very refreshing and energizing. I listen to them very often, and in many different playlists.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This series, I believe is based on the comic book character Green Arrow, After watching the pilot, I was hooked. It has an excellent story line with lots of action. I would highly recommend this new series.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Well written, excellently acted. Held my attention for the entire film. The Batman movies have never made my top ten before, but this is absolutely on my top 10 for 2012.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Rapp kicks ass from page one to the last. Best Mitch Rapp book since Extreme Measures. Highly recommended - get it on your Xmas list if you didn't already buy it for yourself.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is a great book. I am only part way through and already I can see applications to learning Chinese Mandarin which is a goal of mine. Kudos to Tim for breaking down learning into easily digestible steps.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Have been a Reacher fan for several years, but had never read the earlier books. Am trying to play catch up. No. 1 and No. 2 are just as good as any I have read. Will pray Lee Child doesn't break down in the future as many of our popular authors have.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|what else would you expect ? Same sound as ever, nothing changes. but it's good, so why change what we like ?
B009X00E18|5.0|I have this case for my 7 in. Fire, I've had it for almost 2 years now and it's still in great condition. I also have 2 kids, a 5 year old and a 2 year old, who play with this tablet. It has been dropped, stepped on (ugh), thrown, and fought over! This case holds up perfectly. The fold over cover does seem flimsy, but its not. I am getting the new Kindle fire HD 8.9 inch, and I am soooo glad there is a Marware Microshell for the 8.9 in., I wouldn't want to use anything else. This is Perfect for the Fire !!! (especially if you have kids) :)
B000ULQV0W|3.0|sound is great, though a bit less emotional than when you watch the film and hear the music there and then. but all in all, pretty good.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Watching this movie was a blast, it won't change your life though.  It is an action movie that never takes itself too seriously, lots of bad guys killed and stuff blowing up.  If you are looking for a film to advance your intelligence or change the way you view the world...get something else, if you are looking for a movie to entertain you and see some of the best action stars of your child hood (age depending) then this is the one.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I watched the movie for about 30 minutes and couldn't watch anymore.  Although I appreciate and enjoy quirky, independent films, this completely missed the mark for me.  I couldn't connect with any of the characters because there was really no character development.  It was as if the screenwriter and film maker said, &#34;lets put together some crazy, quirky characters and see what happens.&#34;  For me, their experiment failed.

0553103547|5.0|This book is perfect. I was worried that I would be getting hardbacks that weren't all the same size (I'm very particular about my books series) but it matches the other books from the series that I have ordered!

0307387178|4.0|I have some very mature, well-read preteen friends who chose this for our book club reading. They're unusual (ages 11 and 12) but I think it's safe to generalize this to older kids. The book offers opportunity for interesting discussions appropriate to the world of adolescents, such as learning from mistakes (or not), forgiveness, weighing whether sticking to ones' principles is worth hurting other people, and the allure of risktaking and danger. I read it when it first came out and found that rereading it with these new eyes made it new and interesting for me.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is one of the best television shows on! I love that the first season is so short because it is enough to to get people hooked! Great tv show.
0316228532|4.0|THE CASUAL VACANCY is an above average book that has a great deal to say about some of the more negative aspects of human nature.  Of course the reader has to be willing to stay with the novel past its very confusing and uninviting start to get to the interesting character studies and darkly humorous main plot that centers around the pettiness of small city politics.  The book begins with the unexpected death of the saintly Barry Fairbrother who served on the town's parish council.  We are introduced to many of the townspeople through their reaction to his sudden passing and by the time of his funeral we have a pretty good understanding of the identity and foibles of the main players.  Parents and their teenage children are a major component of the book and J.K. Rowling shows the same understanding of the difficulties of coming of age that she did in the Harry Potter books. However THE CASUAL VACANCY is definitely a book written for adults or very mature adolescents as it is much more graphic in its depictions of some of the realities of life than the Potter books.  I hope J.K.Rowling continues to publish novels for both adults and children as she is a very talented storyteller with a great ability to create realistic characters. Rowling has a lot of  insight in to the human condition and it able to convey this in a manner that connects to a wide audience.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This television show is one of my favorites! I got it as a gift, and I can't wait to get everyone else hooked!

B00821BLX4|3.0|you can buy these directly from Olympus USA online for $19.95.  Why are these people charging so much more for the exact same item?
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but I think that Ky's emotions are a little too dull. Also would Cassia really just let him go at the end?
B001HC8516|5.0|Delightful romp through the matches and mis-matches between men & women, the communication connects and disconnects, the happy moments and the dive-into-bed-for-a-week-because-he-broke-my-heart moments.  Every woman who has a friend who is dating must read this book.
B0096CDG0O|2.0|promptly uninstalled because of needing to log in. don't want online play. online should be an option, not mandatory. if I wanted online play, id go somewhere I already have an account.

B004EWFV9K|5.0|I discovered Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallender series after reading &#34;The Girl Who ....&#34; trilogy. Amazon recommended the Wallender books, and I've read and loved them all. I've grown to be friends with Kurt Wallender and his co-workers. Not only did they solve extremely puzzling cases, the author gave us a little window into their private lives with each new book. There was some foreshadowing in the last few books: Kurt's health was declining, some favorite characters had retired or moved on, Kurt was unsure about his remaining years on the force. I knew what was coming, but I won't give away the ending for those who haven't read the book. It ended bitter-sweetly, but in a way that satisfied me. Mankell ties the series up neatly with references to earlier cases and their outcomes, with resolutions to some of the relationships which Wallender has dealt with in the past. We read about his ex-wife, his friends and mentors, his daughter, and his love for Baiba. All this while Kurt struggles to find the solution to a woman's murder; locate a missing man who's been an important figure in the Swedish Navy and also his daughter's future father-in-law; and the discovery of a secret espionage group. All this while coping with his diabetes and failing memory! Somehow, Mankell manages to pack all this and more into the latest and last of the Wallender series. Will I have to start reading them over, or will Mankell deliver a bit more in a new crime series? I fervently hope so!
B009MF56GC|5.0|This is a excellent movie, not as good as the first movie in my opinion, but good nonetheless! Blu-ray is the way to go!
B005LAIHRC|3.0|I wanted to see Tom in a role that was out of his action element. He plays this part to a T. I don't care for the casting that was chosen for the two main young singers and alas they take up most of the movie. I would definitely love to see Tom play something similar like this again.
B004FEL6GO|5.0|This hasn't been opened or played with yet but it looks good and I'm hoping it will be fun for my 5yr old grandson to play with.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Was a good movie could have been better at points.  Still leaves questions to answers from Aliens movie.  Do not watch and expect a prequel to Aliens, it should be considered a back story of the space jockey not so much the alien race itself.
B007M45PMU|4.0|If you like Of Monsters and Men's then this is for you.  The are several songs that as good as Hey Ho.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Adele is a great musician.  Her music is so powerful. This CD has so many songs and each one is great. I hate buying CDs and only liking one or two songs. I like this entire CD and so will you.
B00973DDN2|3.0|The Killers lastest release was ok, nothing too thrilling.  Over all I like it but would not say I loved it.

1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It's was good to see someone as credible as Eben Alexander relating his experience of the afterlife.  I have read numerous other books on this subject.  There are many folks who just think this is a figment of the mind however anyone who delves into the numerous cases will see the facts cannot be disputed.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|If you found yourself completely obsessed with this show like I did, seize the first opportunity to buy the box set of season 1.  It won't disappoint!
B000XPOB0M|4.0|Hilary Swank does a great job per usual, although the movie is pretty predictable. It actually has a few twists and turns, and the acting is good enough to sit back and enjoy the show!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is a really interesting character and continues to grow. I enjoy following his life as the books move one.
159448385X|5.0|I loved loved loved this book. It's sad (naturally), but it's beautifully written. As heartbreaking as moments are, it's a wonderful read.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am always waiting for the next right after I finish reading the current one. Jack is my favorite character.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The companion to book 4, terrible in my opinion.  Too much focus on outside characters and lack of knowledge of the main characters. Also, huge let down in the end. I honestly don't think I'll bother with the rest of the books.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I didn't really like the plot. The thoughts she had about all the men was very strange. Her earlier books were much more interesting.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Great series to get sucked into. Bought this for my kindle after reading the first book from the library.  Just beware and don't pick favorites. Anything can happen!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This third book didn't hold my interest as much as the first 2 but it still was good. I am going to start the next book soon since each is such a cliffhanger.
0143038419|4.0|Very inspirational and interesting! I saw the movie and decided to read the book out of curiosity and I'm glad I did! It was great!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love playing this and have since I got my Kindle. I want to give it 5 stars but the latest update (around Thanksgiving)is causing problems. I'm currently level 100. When getting items you can't scroll through all of them without being kicked out of the game. Planting crops now does the same thing when trying to select some of the higher level crops. I've tried all the suggestions on how to fix the issue but it doesn't seem to work. Beyond that, I still play but it's not as much fun if you can't utilize all the items.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Only read it because I am one of those people who HAVE TO GET TO THE END of the book/series. It seemed kind of hurried. Or maybe that was me hurrying to get to the end. Not a memorable series of books. All I remember was Anna, Christian, sex. No details no nothing. All this E.L. James hub bub for nothing. I wish I wasn't a crazy person who has to finish everything I start.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved this book.  Very different from what I thought it would be.  The character was one of most interesting characters I have read about in a long, long time.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Zombies are boring.<br />This show matches Jefferson Davis, Vampires, Gettyburg battle, etc.. with several nasty villians--one  played by the guy from PBS show Zen. We never saw enough Zen on PBS in the first place--now he's already a Vampire?
B003L77G6A|5.0|If you are a Big Bang Theory lover then you will no doubt love their season DVDs. Obviously it includes all the episodes, but the outtakes are hilarious. This DVD keeps me laughing all the way through.

159562015X|4.0|We had to purchase this for class and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I learned about myself through the process. It gives you good tips for how to put your learning styles or personality traits to good use. And I find myself using the information I gained from this experience in my education and work tasks.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|Without question this is one of the greatest movies of its time. I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys action, a bit of history, and any film lovers!
0786956291|2.0|The idea of the product is good, but the realization is pretty bad.<br />The books contains a lot of mistakes, the characters are not compatible with D&D 4th, dungeon tiles are paper instead of cardboard...<br /><br />I don't recommend it. Start downloading the basic rules from D&D webpage and then buy the core books and the tiles.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|this movie is quite sensational, i highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good movie, this movie sets itself apart from the rest of the competition, it is originally done and mind boggling!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|After reluctantly watching season 1, I couldn't help but buy season 2. Now I never miss an episode. I also want to say that these video played flawlessly on my Kindle Fire.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|If you enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes i strongly recommend seeing this one as well. it is not as good, however it is still an excellent movie, and despite my opinions on the end of this movie I will most definitely be watching this movie several more times!
B00A17AD36|5.0|I have to be honest, I had never even heard of this album but it was suggested thru Amazon b/c of some of my other music purchases. I love this album b/c it is so different. I can just leave this music on all day and listen to it without skipping any songs. I am now a fan!<br /><br />UPDATE: Almost a month later, I refuse to listen to anyone else. His 30+ songs are on the heaviest rotation on my player and laptop. I can not pick a single favorite, but if I had to narrow it down to a few they would be: Wicked Games, The Birds Pt 2, Outside, Gone, and The Knowing. I cannot stress how awesome this music is, I literally leave it on at work all day and then again when I go to sleep at night. Dude is the truth. If you haven't purchased it yet, I would suggest you do so. You will not regret it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Batman is amazing. The whole series is amazing. To be completely honest I did think that the Dark Knight was a little bit overrated, I enjoyed it, but it was not as good as everyone made it out to be. This complete series is rivaled only by the origonal Star Wars Trilogy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy! This being said if you already have the first two movies finish the collection! And if you dont have any just buy the complete set for an extra 10 dollars!
B006WQLH7G|1.0|I did not use this as I already had a security on my notebook. When I checked I had 3 programs and only needed one!
B0060CTLOI|5.0|I used to watch this as a child and due to my love for movies and Disney i could not resist. If you have never seen this movie and are older you may not appreciate this movie too much, but if you have children I am sure that they will!
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Having read Fantasy novels all my teenage life (Harry Potter, Twilight, The Vampire Diaries etc) I haven't come across a series that made the fantastical world of Vampires, Witches and Daemons so believable. Maybe it is because the plot is set at a University? Or because it includes historical figures? I cannot exactly pin-point why Deborah Harkness's version makes one believe that there are witches and vampires living freely among us. The \\"forbidden love\\" story is refreshingly new as her characters have human traits (no sparkly skin and stalking stares here!). The plot itself carries along at a good pace, with historical facts nicely interspersed within the story so one doesn't feel left out at all.<br />If you've grown up reading fantasy and don't want to give it up just because you're out of your teens and need to \\"grow up\\" this series is perfect for you!!
B003L77GGA|5.0|I have always love the smallville series and this final season does a very good job on ending the series. I will say that it did not end the way that I had hopped but none the less the season was excellent!

B006ZE66P8|5.0|This is my 2 year-old's favorite book right now. That's right--he's 2 but he asks for the ghosts at least twice a day.  I'm not sure how much of the story he grasps, but the edited text makes it possible to read a classic like this to kids (we have a 5 year old too who loves the story as well) without boring them or losing them to the extended descriptions.  The illustrations are fantastic and it works fabulously as an ebook on both our iPad and Kindle Fire.  This is how adaptations are supposed to be. Well done!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The streaming worked great. There were no problems with it stopping while playing. I was very happy with the service

0316056863|2.0|Tina Fey has always rubbed me the wrong way. I got this audiobook in hopes of figuring out what everyone else loves about her, I was hoping I could get to like her too. Instead from comments about working at the Y and comparing the dispossessed men who lived there to children, comparing being slightly overweight to slowly turning republican, and people who are on psych meds please do whatever it takes to not go crazy. It just pinpointed the reason why I can't stand her. She cares about women's rights because she is a woman, she doesn't seem to have any consideration for people outside of her own life experience which besides show business is extremely limited. Not to mention the constant name dropping and the fact that her whole uneventful life story before SNL was summed up on the 1st disk. I just don't get the fuss over her. I would give it 1 star but I did manage to laugh ONE time during the book and I figure if someone who annoys me can make me laugh they deserve some kind of token, hence the two stars.

B008S4FZHI|2.0|I have every one of Patricia Cornwell's books.  After her initial 8 books they took a turn for the worse and she has never recovered her past wonderful stories.  Most of the stories go on in Scarpetta's head and there's very little interesting action.  I keep promising myself that I won't waste money on the next one, but I always do in the hope that she has gone back to great stories of old.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Got for less than $2.  First show download from Amazon, great experience, great price, Not best series episode but that doesn't have to do with Amazon.

B008CT2CV6|3.0|Movie was so so. I think the plot was interesting and slightly different than the first movie. The ending was interesting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this book based on prior ratings..  This was the first  book  completed  on my  New kindle.  The story content held my interest to the point that I found myself opening up to it every chance I had from beginning to end.  The actual game's portion was the best parts.  I would've liked for the ending to be extended letting us know what happened with the victors after their return home but I guess that will be another book.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|so easy to use, and it is big so you can see it easy, because when you are old like me you need it big to see it.
B007T99ENE|5.0|A deceptively sweet simple story.  Clever, intelligent  writing draws you into what on the surface appears a simple tale of  a young girl's early loves and misadventures. An enjoyable ride. McEwan is the master of the slight of hand, you will not see the end coming. Recommend.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Well written, but very little happens over several hundred pages.<br />I know this is not fiction, but the factual part could have been wirtten shorter to its advantage.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is absolutely wonderful! I saw it on my &#34;On Demand&#34; and then had to buy it.  I have seen it 3 times and will watch it over and over again.  It is heartwarming, funny, sad and poignant.  Don't pass this movie up!
1932100660|1.0|This is a terrible book.  The China study has been refuted and found to contain false information.  I would not waste your time with his lies!

B00A7CI82I|5.0|Blah, I want Matt Damon back. Not enough action. Too much bogus plot. lame movie. Im done with the Bourne series starting now.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Since basically calling it quits with the Pink Floyd name. David Gilmours solo CD is probably his best ever, even though he hasn't really released alot of solo albums. IMO this album is a complete 180 from the psychedelic days of the 60's and 70's of PF. But maybe thats the way he wanted it. Though 6 years later since its release it maybe time for DG to add a new album to his resume, but thats just me. David was once named the best Stratocaster player of all time over JH and SRV.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This is a great movie and Eastwood is masterful. I love most all he has done. I have been a fan of his since I was a kid.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I probably would still be asleep if not for this app.  I love that you can customize it to your needs and desires.  I use it to remind me of appointments and so many other things.  I also love that I can wake up to my favorite song every morning.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|I am a long time Mott & Ian Hunter fan, and if you are a fan of this music, you will love this album.  It is inconceivable that Ian is still cranking out consistently excellent rock'n'roll albums like this at this point in his career, but this is an album that musicians 40 years younger would kill to be able to make.  Ian rocks as hard as ever, and his lyrics are deft and witty as ever.  No question that &#34;President&#34; ranks with the best of Ian's career.
B004SIP8OI|4.0|The Bride wakes up after a long coma. The baby that she carried before entering the coma is gone. The only thing on her mind is to have revenge on the assassination team that betrayed her - a team she was once part of. (IMDB) The lead character, called 'The Bride,' was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, lead by her lover 'Bill.' Upon realizing she was pregnant with Bill's child, 'The Bride' decided to escape her life as a killer. She fled to Texas, met a young man, and on the day of their wedding rehearsal was gunned down by an angry and jealous Bill (with the assistance of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad). Four years later, 'The Bride' wakes from a coma, and discovers her baby is gone. She, then, decides to seek revenge upon the five people who destroyed her life and killed her baby. The saga of Kill Bill Volume I begins. (JD) Great action movie that will leave you wanting to see the sequel.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|In case your wondering, it's not just amazon that has shipped bad sets.<br />I bought mine from Music Direct as a Christmas present to me and my 10 year old son who loves the Beatles.<br /><br />The condition of the vinyl is totally unacceptable!!<br /><br />Was packed nicely. I have not played any of discs as I am in process of purchasing a turntable but I had to open this set early, with all the bad reviews I could not risk missing my 30 day satisfaction guarantee.<br />So all I say from a purely visual perective.<br />First the box is glossy, would have much preferred a matte or harder rough cardboard with maybe some metal protection on corners and maybe a clasp, but no Biggie so far.<br />The jackets? Well, I was expecting a thicker stock card board, these are almost as flimsy as English jackets of the 60's but without the laminate. Very disappointing. So thin that ring wear is appearing already on Rubber Soul, Revolver, Abbey Road, and Let it Be.<br />The Original inner sleeves are not reproduced from originals, although SGT Pepper inner sleeve is here.<br />From there it gets worse, but won't bore you with all the details, although ask and I will respond.<br />Let's just say, almost all of these vinyls have slightly rough to extremely rough edges, with a couple of the albums having large chunks hanging off the edge.<br />Many of the spindle holes and labels are inaccurately cut, either fraying vinyl or paper label problems, sometimes crinkled label or bubbled label, and some appear to be off center.<br />A couple of the albums have feel able blemishes, uneven run in edges.<br />MMT and SGT Pep jackets are dinged, and the 5 x 7 band photos in White Album were all pinch in the binding, thus bending all the photos.<br /><br />Do I really need to listen to these before returning this Box set?<br />Of course not, although I would like to, but like I said,  I am currently without a turntable.<br /><br />I'm just glad I opened it, so I can now start my probably endless routine of shipping returns back to Music Direct.<br />It looks like I am going to have to pay for all the shipping and re shipping costs.<br />When all of this is done, I will be sending my shipping receipts to EMI.<br />Thanks a lot ya EMI wankers!
B004SIP8SY|5.0|According to IMBD, on Kill Bill Volume 2 (For Information Purposes), During the opening credits, we see the Bride's bloodied face again and hear her say &#34;Bill, it's your baby.&#34; In the first scene, we see her driving an open car and saying that there is only one left to kill (which answers the question whether she believed that Elle died). She is on her way to Bill.<br /><br />Chapter 6: The Massacre at Two Pines<br /><br />Back at the beginning (a black-and-white segment), at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel in El Paso, TX, a dress rehearsal for a wedding is taking place. Reverend Harmony (Bo Svenson) and his wife (Jeannie Epper) decide that, since the bride will have no relatives present at the wedding, the groom's relatives and friends can sit on both sides of the aisle. The Bride (Uma Thurman) leaves the chapel to get some fresh air; on the way out, she is disturbed to hear flute music. On the front porch she finds Bill (David Carradine) sitting on a bench playing his bamboo flute. She asks him to be nice and he replies that he does not know how to be nice but will do his best to be sweet. They enter the hall and she introduces Bill to her fiancé as her father but rejects the fiancé's idea that, as her father, he should give her away at the ceremony. As the bride and groom are called to the front by the Reverend Harmony, no attempt is made to introduce 'father' to the rest of the fiancé's family. Bill stays at the back of the chapel.<br /><br />Outside the chapel, four armed assassins appear, all dressed in black. In one line they move to the door, they enter, and the shooting starts, killing everybody inside except for the Bride and Bill.<br /><br />Back in the present (in color), Bill visits his younger brother Budd (Michael Madsen), a.k.a. Sidewinder, at his trailer in the middle of nowhere and warns him about the Bride. She will kill Budd if Budd does not allow Bill to protect him. They had differences in the past but they should move on. Budd, drinking as they talk, replies that maybe they should get killed because the Bride deserves her revenge. He then infuriates Bill by saying that he pawned his priceless samurai sword (a gift from Bill) for $250.<br /><br />Chapter 7: The Lonely Grave of Paula Schulz<br /><br />Budd goes to work. He works as a bouncer in a local strip club. He arrives 20 minutes late and sees that there are no customers in the club. He talks briefly with the bartender, Jay, before he is called into the office by his hot-tempered, coke-snorting boss Larry Gomez. In the office, Larry argues with Budd over being late again, and Budd talks back, saying that there is nobody in the bar & there was no need for him to be there. Larry takes away all Budd's scheduled hours and tells him in a rude tone not to come back to work until he hears from him. In the bar, Budd agrees to clean up after a broken toilet that a stripper named Rockets says is overflowing.<br /><br />Budd returns to his trailer but standing in front of it suddenly freezes. He enters the trailer but looks out the window. The Bride, who was hiding under the trailer, sticks to the wall so he does not see her. When she opens the door Budd shoots her in the chest with a shotgun loaded with rock salt. While she lies wounded on the ground, Budd is very pleased with himself and injects her with a sedative. He phones Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and offers to sell her the Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword for a million dollars. Elle agrees to bring the money in the morning. Her condition is that the Bride must die and suffer to her last breath.<br /><br />Budd and an accomplice of his dig a large hole in the ground at a local cemetery to bury the wounded Bride alive. When the grave has been dug, the Bride is given a choice: if she does not resist, she'll be given a flashlight; if she does, Budd will burn out her eyes with mace and leave her buried alive in darkness. She chooses the flashlight, is put in a coffin and the lid is nailed down. Budd and his accomplice lower the coffin into the ground and cover it with soil. The Bride panics for a short time and recalls her training under Pai Mei.<br /><br />Chapter 8: The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei<br /><br />In a flashback, Bill and the Bride (very much in love with him) sit by a campfire somewhere in China and Bill, who calls her &#34;kiddo,&#34; plays his flute. He tells her about his kung fu teacher Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu, credited as Gordon Liu) and his 'five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique.' The technique involves five blows administered to particular pressure points on the body. Thereafter, the victim's heart explodes after he or she takes five steps. Pai Mei did not teach Bill the technique because he does not show it to anyone.<br /><br />At the foot of the steps leading to Pai Mei's place in another part of rural China, Bill, who has just come down, informs the Bride that Pai Mei will take her as his pupil because he is lonely. Bill's bruised face shows that he was hurt but he refuses to say what happened. Bill warns her not to show any disrespect or disobedience to Pai Mei because Pai Mei will kill her -- &#34;he hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women.&#34; She climbs the steps and quickly is humiliated by Pai Mei, who scorns her fighting skills and her ethnicity. He challenges her to land one blow on him while they engage in hand-to-hand combat and the Bride fails. Pai Mei threatens to chop her hand off with a single blow and declares that her hand belongs to him and she must strengthen it. Over the next several weeks, the Bride works hard (practicing martial arts forms and bringing buckets of water up the steps) and learns hard. She finds striking a blow with her fist to break a hole through a thick wooden plank at close range the most difficult skill.<br /><br />Back to the present. Still inside the coffin, the Bride manages to remove her boots and the belt tying her feet together. She takes out a straight razorhidden in her boot and uses it to cut her hands free. She hits the coffin lid with her fist repeatedly. The lid becomes smeared with her blood but it finally cracks. She appears to swim up through the earth, and an arm emerges from the grave. The Bride crawls out. Covered in dirt, she walks into a diner, sits down and calmly asks for a glass of water.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Elle and I<br /><br />The Bride walks a great distance across the desert and through the mountains. She reaches Budd's trailer in time to see Elle arrive.<br /><br />Elle enters the trailer and gives Budd a red suitcase full of money. He makes margaritas in a grubby blender and serves them in dirty jelly-jar glasses while she examines the sword. He opens the suitcase, gloats over the money, and is struck in the face by a venomous black mamba snake that was hidden among the bundles of cash. Before he dies, Elle tells him that she is sorry that such a &#34;piece of shit&#34; as himself was the one who managed to kill the Bride -- she deserved better. She phones Bill and tells him that the Bride has killed his brother but that she, Elle, has killed the Bride. Elle also reveals the whereabouts of the final resting place of the Bride (in the grave of Paula Schulz) and mentions the Bride's real name for the first time: Beatrix Kiddo.<br /><br />Beatrix walks in and immediately attacks Elle. Their long and vicious fight destroys the trailer's interior. In a lull in the hostilities, Beatrix asks Elle how she lost her eye and Elle says that Pai Mei ripped it out because she offended him. Elle tells Beatrix that she poisoned Pai Mei in revenge and he died. They continue to fight and Elle gets hold of the Bride's sword. In a golf bag, the Bride finds another katana, inscribed &#34;To my brother Budd, the only man I ever loved, Bill&#34; -- apparently Budd did not sell it after all. As they face off, Elle relishes the irony of killing the Bride with her own sword. However, at close range, the Bride plucks out Elle's remaining eye and steps on it. Rather than finish killing Elle, Beatrix leaves the trailer, the black mamba hissing behind her as Elle shrieks and curses and flails.<br /><br />Last Chapter: Face to Face<br /><br />In Mexico, the Bride visits the courtly retired pimp Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks), Bill's old mentor, and asks him to tell her where Bill is. He finally agrees because he thinks Bill would surely like to see her.<br /><br />She enters Bill's hacienda carefully, a gun in her hand, but is shocked to the point of tears when Bill and their small daughter B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine), alive, both play-shoot at her with toy guns. She spends good time with her daughter, who falls asleep. The Bride goes to speak to Bill.<br /><br />Bill's warning shot pins Beatrix down in her seat, then he shoots her with a truth-serum dart. She explains why she left him: because she wanted to keep their child safe, not wanting her to grow up to be assassins like them.<br /><br />Flashback to a hotel room: the Bride, who's been sent on an assassination assignment to Japan, discovers that she is pregnant. Another assassin, Karen Kim (Helen Kim), shoots a hole in the door with a shotgun. The Bride, pointing her gun at Karen, convinces her that she is pregnant and persuades her to walk away, promising that she will do the same. As she leaves, Karen congratulates the Bride.<br /><br />Back in the present, Bill is puzzled because he believes that Beatrix is a natural born killer and could not change. He asks if she enjoyed killing the other people on her revenge list, and the truth serum forces her to admit that she did. They agree to fight with swords on the beach -- then Bill suddenly attacks her as they sit on his patio. At the climax of a brief skirmish during which both remain seated, she strikes him with the five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique. She tells Bill that she did not mention that Pai Mei taught her the technique because she is a bad person. Bill disputesthat. They share an affectionate farewell before he takes five steps and falls down dead.<br /><br />Beatrix takes her daughter away to start a new life: &#34;The lioness has rejoined her cub, and all is right in the jungle.&#34;

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have read all of Grisham's novels.  I typically really look forward to getting into the story and following the plot line.  In this case, the first 1/2 of the book was very good (like usual), but the second half was ridiculous.  you have to suspend all instincts of disbelief to continue reading.  It was almost like Grisham felt he could take the story and the characters whereever he wanted and trust that the readers would believe this could even remotely all hold together.  It was far-fetched and not worth the time to read.

B005NJU8PA|3.0|I'll come back to edit my review, but as of right now I'm about half way through.<br /><br />Cooking for me is a creative outlet and a hobby. I work in the food ingredient industry, so I have a little bit more knowledge than some.<br /><br />Once I got beyond Julia Child, I started looking at Knife Skills, Jacques Pepin's Techniques, The Science and Lore of the Kitchen and LOTS of other cookbooks. Things from the 1940s up until now.<br /><br />For the first 20% of the book, I wondered if Timothy was ever going to talk about cooking. We got to learn how he's learned various languages in weeks. How he became a world class tango dancer in a couple of months. His theories about learning. His trips all over the world. His slow carb diet. All of the people that he's meet in sports, teaching, cooking and other things. His Four Hour Body book. And god only knows what else.<br /><br />I'd describe the first 20% of the book as more of an autobiography of Timothy Ferriss. I'd also wonder if Timothy has an ADHD problem. Her certainly does have a hard time talking about one thing for any period of time.<br /><br />I have now gotten into the food and his cooking ideas. Obviously, the way to properly hold a knife isn't going to change and he covers things such as that.<br /><br />What he does do well is explaining terminology to people that other cookbooks never really cover. ie. What EXACTLY does braising mean as it relates to cooking. The difference between braising and sauteing. For those who don't know, this book will definitely help you.<br /><br />I just find the book odd.

0385536828|1.0|This novel did not do it for me.  It was contrived and boring.  I try to finish everything I start but this was a slog and I almost did not finish it.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|A lot of repetition from Tim's 1st 2 books. But that doesn't detract to the realms of helpful information for budding or accomplished chefs.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|It's so lala, I really can't say it's good or bad. If you are a fan of the series, get it, you will want to watch it, but the WOW effect of the first movies is gone. This one is better than the &#34;first part&#34; or this two parter, which should have been named &#34;Harry Potter And The Shameless Moneymaker&#34; but it's still nothing to make you jump out of the chair
0375507256|5.0|When I first began to read this book, I was hesitant about it because I wasn't pulled in right off the bat. But as I neared the end of the first section I was picking up speed and reading much more eagerly. Once I started the second section I was hooked! The book did not dazzle me with every part, so I was sucked into some more than others, but I still enjoyed each section for it's uniqueness and contribution to the overall story. I feel that each section is an important part of the book as a whole and had I not read them all I would've missed out. I loved the fact that I went into this book with an open mindset, not really knowing what to expect and I think other readers would enjoy taking the same route. The stories are unexpected and well written, and all have a connection to each other. I will most definitely be reading this again at some point in the future because I enjoyed the characters and storyline that much.<br /><br />To go into a bit more detail as far as my thoughts on the story, I'm going to review each section individually.<br /><br />****SPOILERS****<br /><br />The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing: I found this section very difficult to get through. I have read my fair share of books with older style narrative but I found it difficult to follow here. To follow what was actually occurring versus the times things had a dreamlike quality. And then to slog (I feel terrible using that word) through the history of the Moriori. I don't know...I found it a bit boring and found myself wondering what purpose learning their history would serve long-term in the book. This section only just perked my interest once he discovered Autua on the ship. And unfortunately coming back to it at the end, although I felt a certain satisfaction over finding out what happens to the characters, it just couldn't measure up to several of the wonderful stories in the middle.<br /><br />Letters from Zedelghem: I LOVED the character Robert Frobisher. I was just so taken with this section. He was this scoundrel of a character that didn't give the reader any reason to root for him and yet I was! When he laid out his plan to meet Vyvyan and wile his way into becoming his student I was intrigued and carrying a conspirators smile while I read, eager to see how his plan fared. And I loved his sense of humor. I think part of my affection for this section was due to my lackluster reception of the last one, I was so pleased with the change of backdrop, era and tone of writing that it made me greedily eat up the storyline. Not to mention that this one was the first section that we see a peek at the interconnection the stories will have with one another. When Robert finds Adam Ewing's journal my interest piqued because it was a delightful twist that I wasn't expecting. So I was definitely looking forward to getting to the second portion of this story and it didn't disappoint, even with the decidedly dark end of my dear Robert Frobisher. (I have a friend who disliked Robert, and have read several reviews where people did not care for him either, so I feel like the outcast for enjoying his unscrupulous character so much!)<br /><br />Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery: This section was fantastic. Which can definitely be attributed to it's thematic style...that sort of mystery-suspense-thriller type. In fact the suspense I felt reading it and the type of story it was honestly reminded me so much of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series I read about six months ago. That series was so good and I enjoyed it so much I've felt slightly bereft without it. But this section brought me back to the same feelings I had reading those books. It was marvelous. The only drawback it had for me was as it was wrapping up near the end of the second half I felt it was getting a bit outlandish during it's climax. I hate being too critical of that but I felt it all the same.<br /><br />The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish: This one was hard, and I really liked the ending,but the first part was HARD to like. It was like gritting my teeth trying to enjoy it. I don't know if I really \\"got\\" the british style humor? And maybe that caused a great disconnect for me? But I also know I have an issue when a main character is rendered pretty much helpless (either physically, mentally or through resources). I guess for lack of a better word I feel claustrophobic. So it wasn't until the second half that I was able to breath easier and enjoy it more because I felt he did have the possibility of getting out. And I'm embarrassed to admit but during his second (or was it third?) escape attempt I skipped to the end real quick just to see if it works or not because I NEEDED to know. After that I was able to enjoy it. I wasn't overly fond of any of the characters and I thought the connection the author drew with this section to the next one (by the distant future having an old film based on this) was the weakest of all of them and felt the most contrived.<br /><br />An Orison of Sonmi~451: My absolute favorite story. From beginning to end, I enjoyed every bit of this story and wasn't bored for a minute. But I most definitely have a soft spot for futuristic/scifi/dystopian settings, so that might have been the reason I loved this one so much. And I loved the interview-style narrative that Mitchell used. I thought it was a clever vehicle to provide the story and I think I liked it better that way than just written like the Luisa Rey mystery. My favorite character of the entire novel is Sonmi. I loved reading about her step by step discovery of the world as her awareness became more and more distinct. I think I enjoyed learning the journey she'd forged more than any other character in the book.<br /><br />Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After: I think I liked this section the least. The narrative style was extremely off-putting. Another review of this book used the word abrasive and I couldn't agree more. The story itself was rather compelling and Meronym's character kept me going. I liked the idea of this distant race of her people and the structure itself kept me going because I wanted to find out what happened to our world post-Sonmi-era---wanted to know how we had devolved back to this ancient lifestyle. But the narration was BRUTAL. Ugh, how I didn't like it! Now the the interesting thing is I don't necessarily think the author should have written it differently. It seemed that throughout the novel his jumps in styles of writing, tone and language were important for world building. And I appreciate his motivation to do that so I don't exactly fault him for this utterly unlikeable narration. At the end of the day the story was rich and compelling, so it made up for it.<br /><br />By the end I was completely surprised by how thoroughly I had enjoyed the book (even moreso once I had finished and was able to reminisce over each part). I was impressed that the author took several small, slightly interconnected stories to tell one big one. It definitely represents the reoccurring theme that no matter what time or place, humanity follows the same patterns. I think Mitchell did a wonderful job with that concept. I will be recommending it to anyone and everyone because it's such a worthy book to dig into.

0307744434|4.0|I was very intrigued when I initially read the premise of this story. The mysterious air of a unique traveling circus and it turning into the playground on which an equally mysterious competition is played out. And while I thought the storyline was well done, the thing that actually pulled me further and further along was the author's amazing ability to bring the circus alive in my imagination. It has been a very long time since I have read a book with such stunning visual descriptions. Her portrayal of the lighting and the scents you can encounter and the incredible feats of enchantment you see at Le Cirque des Rêves is nothing short of magical.<br /><br />I literally felt bewitched myself because I remember being so eager to read about new additions Marco or Celia had added to the circus. And to be honest, even though I believe world-building is important to any story, I am usually much more interested in characterization. Characters need to be fleshed out and interesting, flawed and unique as a fingerprint, so that is usually what I have my eye out for, but this book definitely enthralled me more with regards to the world these characters lived in.<br /><br />That's not to say I didn't enjoy Celia and Marco. I liked how Celia was very self-composed. So many authors like writing the assertive, loud, firecracker type of character, but Celia was more quiet and self-possessed. And Marco's intensity was well portrayed. It suited him with the way he was closeted in his own little world for most of his life carefully inscribing his words and symbols and glyphs in his notebooks. I was fond of the author describing his ink stained fingers several times. Little details like that I enjoy. The side characters were well drawn also and it was interesting to discover as the story unfolded, the integral part each of them would play in the scheme of the whole story.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving this book four stars instead of five is because of the structure of the story. This is more personal preference than that the author did anything wrong, I've just never been a fan of stories that split and go back and forth in time. I know that the author used this as a way of blending Bailey's story in with Marco and Celia's, up until the point that they were all interacting in the same timeframe but it was still a bit distracting for me. Even as much as I enjoyed Bailey's character and story, sometimes when his parts came up I just wanted to be reading more about Celia and Marco's dealings with the circus. So it wasn't so much that I didn't want to be reading about Bailey at all, but that I didn't always care to have his parts inserted in-between sequences with the two main characters. But honestly that is still a minor thing (and I only mentioned it in order to explain the rating otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned it at all!) Overall I enjoyed the book immensely.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was so encouraging, showing what Jesus Christ can do with you life if you give it to him.  From being dependent on drugs and very undependable Adam's life changed after meeting his Lord and Saviour.  Kelley was his perfect match and she<br />helped wherever she needed to.  I liked this book because it gave us a life to look at Christ through.  I pray that Kelley will always depend on the Lord for her strength and decisions she has to make.  Thanks for opening your life up to everyone.

B0076D20E8|4.0|I really liked this movie and all it's intrigue.  It purports the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare, not the usual Stratsfordian theory, based on a book written in 1910. A historian told me this is a minority opinion and Wikipedia gives credit to both theories. But whatever is true, the movie makes Queen Elizabeth, the characters, and the Oxforidan theory seem plausable and alive. I thought the movie was well-done and worth a rental.
B007HACDLK|5.0|loved this new book. Full of excitment and intrigue.  Hope to read more of Mr Flynn books in the future,I've read all of them.  Hope that Mr Flynn is in remission and cancer free.  I recommend this to anyone that loves a good adventure!
B00715SUI6|4.0|This movie truly frightened me.  I like scary ghost stories, but this was a leave-the-light-on and don't-be-alone movie.  I still can't watch the first, second or fourth versions since Toby was so real.  A friend that also likes ghost stories was also creeped-out by Toby.  Very well told story from late 70s.  Creepy, surprising, and bone-chillingly scary.
B003XDZMPY|5.0|it´s a confortable shoes, its a good model, I recommend, i like to much, i need more colors and more model
B009VB97EY|3.0|I resisted watching this movie because I thought it was going to be close to an X-rated show, but it's not.  It's not as graphic as Sex in the City was nor do they do close ups on the guys' assets.  It's well shot.  The dancing is the best part, especially Channing Tatum.  The story is a little slow and pedantic for me.  But I watched the dancing several times since I love dance shows.  I guess this is Channing's first movie to produce and it's about his life and experience in this world of dance.  Some cussing and crude moments when the guys are off-stage but I fast-forwarded through those; no nudity.

B005JE7WKI|4.0|This movie is EXTREMELY well made.  Great fun and something that really values and appreaciates the horror genre.<br /><br />Another movie I keep raving about is extremely similar (same opening and everything):  [[ASIN:B0099SI3LM Roadside Massacre]]<br /><br />Why?  Both about a group of kids entering a small town, both are homages to TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  Both clearly made by people who love the classic slasher horror films from the 70s and 80s.  Both have some great comedy in them if you really listen.  Both fun black comedies worth taking a look at with some friends (and some beer!).  The ROADSIDE movie is much much more lower budget though, just FYI.<br /><br />Love this genre.
B00846REIS|4.0|The Blackstone affair books are a good read and they are a great price also.  They have a good story plot and it is also a good eroica read. I would recomend this book to the people who have read the 50 shades.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hated that this was the last book.  Once I got stared on the collection I could not stop reading.  It took me a minute to get through the first one but when I finished it and then got started I could not put them down.  I read the second one in like a 1/2 week and then the 3rd one in the other 1/2.  I hope they do come out with a movie and don't mess up the books to bad and I also hope E.L.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|its great and I love being able to switch up the sounds. the grandfather clock sound is my favorite! my son listens to the humming during bed tike
B003X8597K|4.0|So, I bought it because I'm a big Wagner fan and I knew and liked the famous Overture.  Perhaps, above all, I bought it because I wanted to have as complete a collection of Wagner DVDs as possible.  A nice surprise.  The &#34;modern&#34; setting worked very well.  The casting and music were very good and Camilla Nylund is gorgeous.  While I would only give 5 stars to something so great that it warrants getting out of your sick bed to buy it, my four stars mean it's very worthwhile and I thoroughly enjoyed and strongly recommend it.
074356619X|4.0|The basic concept behind this presentation is strong, valid and powerful.  The problem I have with the presentation itself is that it is very misleading in phraseology.  Much more emphasis is needed on the paying attention to what shows up after the intention is put out there and responding in a proactive and energetic and appropriate manner.  It is too easy to listen and get the impression  that once the intention is expressed your job is done; just sit back and wait for it to be &#34;manifested&#34;.  With full awareness of the responsibility to act which follows the intention, this is a very meaningful and enriching belief system.
B009OYTIXS|1.0|A guy gets back from 5 years stranded on an island, and he says to his sister, \\"you were there the whole time?\\" Don't wait until the 7th episode to figure out this is a dumb chick-flick. Crappy acting, cookie-cutter cliches and nonsensical plot.

B003YFJ5U4|5.0|I have read a lot of books on quantum physics; some easy to understand, some not so easy.  What I liked about this one is that Kumar shows the development of the idea of quantum physics step by step.  He traces an understandable history of the idea; he gives the reader information about the major players and where each person fits into the historical timeline.  But more than anything else, he makes the debate very clear.  One side (Einstein and Schroedinger) wants to preserve the real world behind the physics that they feel the theory needs to refer to or represent.  The other side in the debate (Bohr and Heisenberg) says that it doesn't matter if there is a reality behind the physics.  This account makes the philosophical question &#34;what is truth?&#34; come alive.
B003EPPEP4|5.0|Every day music, and we say that for it is on my mp3 player. which I listen to daily at work.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I completed reading the book in less than one week because I couldn't put it down.  The idea of time travel is not new, but, the premise of being able to take multiple trips to the past, with each new trip erasing the results of the previous trip, was an inspired and creative piece of writing.  I loved the idea that such a major change to history would provide the time traveler with a provocative conumdrum (when he returned to the present) of whether or not it was worth making the change.  I am not a Stephen King fan, but, this book was special to me.  I am old enough to clearly remember the events and attitudes of the time frame emphasized in this book.  So, I could feel the pulse and wax nostalgic during my return to those days.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the combination of science fiction and history afforded by this book.

Buy this if you like to play quiet relaxing games every once in a while.
B003QSOFFO|4.0|This is a great Disney movie for the 8+ set.  I think it's a bit heavy and complicated for younger kids.  The music is great, the story is good, and I love that the main heroine is a strong, capable woman!  Plus a bit of (slightly altered) history to boot.

B00A7CI82I|5.0|I give this and all Bourne movies a five star rating. Why? Because of the concept, character, and Genre. These movies have a sense of reality and action that others don't. They have a theme that runs through them all, and that is Government misuse of not only people they don't like but even their own. They use their assets for their agenda and then when that asset becomes to knowledgeable or independent they are expendable. Covert ops and black ops are a Pandora's box for the Government, and no one wants to get caught with their hands in the cookie jar. These movies are all based on the writings of Ludlum who himself had an agenda of exposing what really went on behind the scenes and the dirty little secrets they kept from the public at large. These secrets are not secrets anymore but are becoming all to evident in our lives as we look around and see tell tale signs. My only complaint is that these movies take bits and pieces of Ludlum's novels and create their own story lines and screen plays which bear little resemblance to his brilliant writing or his books. For instance it is never shown in the movies what the origins of the character Jason Bourne really are. Nothing is said of his life with the secret organization called Medusa in the killing fields of Vietnam, how he developed his skills, and how he really acquired the name Jason Bourne. The movies finally show us his real name of David Webb but fail to mention that he assassinated the real Jason Bourne who was in the group Medusa and turned rogue. Nothing is said of the government operation to use David Webb as bait to draw out Carlos the Jackal by using the name Jason Bourne and building a reputation as a rival assassin. These facts are just the tip of the iceberg regarding what's in the real stories or novels upon which these movies are based. His companion Marie is never killed in the novels as she is in the movie but becomes his wife and fellow comrade. But again having said all that, the essence of the novels is somehow captured enough to make these the best spy / covert ops movies around. So far!ovels is somehow captured enough to make these the best spy / covert ops movies around. So far!

B008AX1HD8|1.0|I have read all Jo Nesbo's books, and couldn't wait when I saw that the first Harry Hole \\"The Bat\\" was finally translated.  Wow, I think I know why it took so long to be available.  I am only half way through and am really thinking seriously of not finishing it.  It is badly written, filled with really unrelated drivel and reads more like a schoolboy (or girl) writing.  The characters do not ring true and Harry's stupid actions made me cringe.  Being an Aussie the descriptions of places I know were good, but this is a detective novel, so help me, not a travelogue.  I know Jo Nesbo visited Australia and obviously loved it, but this story is a MAJOR disappointment - not sure I will bother to finish it - which really is something for me. Lack of disciplined storytelling and self indulgent drivel - all I can say is I am glad I read the others first otherwise I would never have picked up another Nesbo......guess what, I couldn't finish it - I found myself skipping great lumps just to get to the end but then thought - why bother....Sorry Jo

B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Brandon Sanderson is best known for his longer works, but I've felt for a while that he could use some experience &#34;working shorter.&#34; Alloy of Law did well enough, but in The Emperor's Soul Sanderson's obviously found his shorter stride, and I think his writing's improved for it. Emperor's Soul never feels rushed, and yet never feels self-indulgent or overly airy. It's well paced and dynamic, even though the vast majority of it takes place in a single room. It's cerebral and abstract, yet never failed to keep my reading interest.<br /><br />I hope this is a sign of good things to come for Sanderson in terms of tighter narrative: it's good to stretch oneself, especially when it comes to having less room to move.
B002Z8LPZ4|3.0|I don't go into a Kate Beckinsale movie looking for riveting writing, masterly directing or breathtaking acting. I go in looking for Kate's latex-clad heinie. Spandex is fine too; I don't want her to grow stale as an actress. That's why I like Kate Beckinsale, she's reliable eye candy. If she wants to learn to act too, that's fine with me, as long as she \\"acts\\" in movies about sexy, bloodthirsty, smoldering vampires, vampire slayers, werewolves, etc. Butthis movie was just not as good as it could have been Usually I don't judge movies like that, but I kept noting missed opportunites so much that i started to annoy myself. For one thing she's wearing a parka for 90% of the movie, and it's not even a latex parka at that!<br /><br />As you may already know, she plays a U.S. Marshal who has requested duty in one of the worst law enforcement jobs on Earth, a station in America's Antarctic base. She's done this because she had a bad experience in Miami while working a drug case and is trying to run away from the guilt and feeling of betrayal that arose from that experience. As usual for a movie cop, just a few days before she is about to retire, bodies start to pile up and she has to make one last bust before she can ride off into the sunset.<br /><br />There are some speed bumps in solving the mystery. A huge storm is a'comin' and if she doesn't solve the mystery before it hits she will be stuck on the base for 6 months during the harsh winter period. Also, there is a masked killer, who looks like any generic masked killer in almost any lower tier thriller, who doesn't want her poking her beautifully tilted nose into his business. And then there's the biggest obstacle, which is the terrible, awful, thoroughly abysmal acting, writing and directing.<br /><br />The movie has an almost glacial pace. There is little building of suspense, followed by a release, followed by a bigger building of suspense.<br /><br />When something does happen, you almost don't even care.<br /><br />Kate's not a bad actress and her character had the potential for some real depth and complexity, the ol' woman running from her demons thing, but Kate doesn't play her that way. As a matter of fact, it seems there were several different currents on the theme of loss here, but none of them were ever explored nearly closely enough, by the actors, writers or directors.<br /><br />Also, the movie doesn't examine the unique setting of the film enough. A murder mystery at the bottom of the world, the most desolate and extreme environment on our planet should have been more interesting than this, just because of its setting. There are a few decent chases through a blizzard, a frozen cup of coffee and a neat scene involving Kate and frostbite, but the isolation, claustrophobia and pure alieness of the environment aren't elaborated on as much as I'd have liked.<br /><br /> Maybe someone will re-make this movie in the future and turn it into the good movie it deserves to be, someone who actually wants to make a good movie instead of just play at it.r />Kate's not a bad actress and her character had the potential for some real depth and complexity, the ol' woman running from her demons thing, but Kate doesn't play her that way.

B005LAIGZU|4.0|Great action flick, my teenage son even liked it!<br /><br />I don't want to give away the ending, but the good guys win!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Got this for my four year old grandson. He loves it. He plays it every day. I've played it also. Additive.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Love Cornwall's Kay Scarpetta and the deep knowledge brought to the page on a little known or understood science.  I sometimes think that popular authors will sell their books whether they are their best efforts, or not.  It may be laziness on the editor's part.  Why examine quick scene and character moves to check if they are clear, if devoted readers will buy her books anyway?<br />Bone Bed suffers from this.  The science and technology is as fresh as ever, but the bone exploration, which Cornwall extols in the afterward, is not explicated enough.  Nor was it clear just how it connected to the villain.<br />If you love the science, Lucy, Marino and Benton, they all play their roles well, but the story is fuzzy, and the ending quick and rather anti-climactic, as usual.<br />As a mystery, this is thin gruel; as a slice of a CSI kind of view, it's filling.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I love this book.  After only trying the mobility routine I feel so much better.  Can't wait to start working on my endurance
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Everything from romance to war ... Great book!<br /><br />The characters are fresh and interesting. Kept me interested all the way through.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Really liked this sequel to Old Man's War.  Picked up with a good twist with less Fighting and more about human and inter-species interaction.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I should have known better when I purchased app after reading someof the reviews.  I got stiffed.  File couldn't because it was corrupted.  I'm calling customer services in the morning  to complain.

B009LA1QW6|5.0|I'm a HUGE Lana Del Rey fan and I honestly thought that she couldn't top Born To Die.<br />My expectations were blown away when I put that album on. I'm amazed all over.<br />It's like I only discovered Lana now. She's amazing and her songs is beautiful.
B001JRB16U|5.0|What child shouldn't grow up knowing how to sing supercalifragilisticexpialidocious??<br /><br />It was so fun to have my 5 year old granddaughter start singing along with me to all the same songs I so enjoyed as a child.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Awesome movie is awesome. ... ugh 16 more words required for this review this for required words more 16 ugh
B0000UJFCO|5.0|Yes is Awesome.  The best they have put out.  The symphony adds such an intense appreciation for the words within the song.
B00004SU5J|5.0|I initially purchased this cd because of one cut I'd been hearing at the clubs and lounges (Sure Thing). I figured this song is hot, too hot to be a fluke ... So the artist must be good. I was right, got the cd and every song was poppin. If you like house/freestyle/jazzy music then try this cd.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Good special effects<br />Predictable plot<br />Entertaining but you feel like you have seen it before.<br />The characters were not that well defined.
1936608898|5.0|I purchased this book and it is amazing! I am a trainer and I use this book to help my clients. I recommend to all of them to buy it and you should too.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Total Class all the way!  Joe is Superb in this Concert DVD!<br /><br />The Band is Tight and the songs are performed at Top-Notch Percison.  Very Entertaining and filled with Emotion, Joe plays guitar like no other.  You literally FEEL his Emotion in every song.<br /><br />If you Love &#34;The Blues&#34;  this Concert DVD is an Absolute Must Have!<br /><br />Josephine Lee
B004OZZ624|5.0|this movie was not predictable at all. russell crows character was so driven to break his wife out of jail, and at every turn you are wondering what he's up to. praying that they don't get caught. i won't give anything away, but see this movie. it's pretty incredible.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|If you love the Blues you will LOVE this DVD!  Electric Guitar Blues at it's Best!  Great Vocals and the band is Tight!<br /><br />Josephine Lee
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I have incorporated many of the exorcises and workouts from this book into my daily routine. Body weight exercises are great for balance, coordination and strength and can be done anywhere without the need of a gym.
B000FA5SMK|2.0|I am 85 and still living with Agatha Christie and her crowd. DeMille is oversexed and potty mouthed which to this geriatric reader spoils a reasonable interesting story. No doubt the younger generation will enjoy the book.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is perfect! My brother loves it! There is no work that I can describe it! He really like it!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|One of my favorite groups! Received this ahead of time in perfect condition! I ave a very long commute in the mornings. This is a life saver! Thanks o much!!!

034553154X|5.0|Big fan of the books and &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; on HBO.  The calendar is very cool, and the art work is exceptional.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She and I love cats, and this was something she's been wanting. We follow The Oatmeal pretty regularly, and decided we'd support his site/work.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|these books are really good! Although the sex scenes get a little bit repetitive and sometimes really graphic the book has a good story line.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I watched this movie after watching &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; and &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; so that may be why I gave it the 4 stars...<br />Personally, I would've loved a bit more action and I'm partial to Katie Holmes as Rachel- I liked Maggie better...<br />And this is super long!! I had to force myself to sit and watch it after the first hour and half lol<br />But it is a good movie!
0345803485|2.0|Is this what the New York Times Bestseller list has come to? I can't believe USA book market is supporting one long meaningless sexalogue as the one depicted in this book, buying this novel to make it number 1. Is this really what Americans are reading?<br /><br />I thought we were moving into a new era of thought. Very dissappointing. Why oh why did I buy the Trilogy?
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP!!!!<br />It keeps my hubby and me entertained for hours!!! I'm usually not a fan of &#34;match 3s&#34; but I can't get enough of Call of Atlantis!
B00932ANQM|1.0|Nicholas Sparks wrote another terrific book filled with everything that his books usually have... love, intrigue, passion, strength, inner turmoil, solid character, human weakness and complex relationships that you wish wouldn't be so complex.  His descriptions, his intent and character shaping were unmistakable.  The story clear.<br /><br />Enter Hollywood.  First off, as usual Hollywood blew it right out of the gates with the casting... mis casting almost every single character in the movie, and horribly so in regards to the leads.<br /><br />Next, they changed the story (I know... nothing unusual here).  Somehow, these idiots got it into their heads that they could tell a story better than a MULTI MULTI times New York Times Best Selling Writer did.  So they changed the story and proceeded to leave out some very important parts to the story... character revealing and plot building parts of the story.<br /><br />So you buy a ticket to the movie or you rent the movie and you sit down and you are ready to be captivated by the story the way Nicholas Sparks did it to you in the book.  Unfortunately, you are immediately disappointed by seeing what the characters look like and how they fill/or don't fill up the screen.  My first thoughts were... that's not Logan.  Shorlty there after, I heard myself saying... what happened to the scene at the lake where Logan and Keith meet for the first time... thats not too important of a scene is it... and yet Hollywood in its infinite wisdom decided to leave this major scene from the book, out of their movie.  Hey, what the heck, its only the scene that sets up THE ENTIRE REST OF THE STORY!<br /><br />Suffice it to say, it just all went downhill from there.  So here's my recomendation, as usual with Hollywood, skip the movie and sit yourself down, get yourself comfortable and re-read Nicholas Sparks' wonderful book... you will be much happier that you did.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|I'd love to buy this movie, but I refuse as long as the digital copy is ultraviolet (UV). When will these people learn that UV is useless, unfriendly, and a waste of time. The only proven way to deliver a digital copy is with the iTunes compatible Digital Copy. With that you can watch it on your iPhone, iPad, computer, TV. No downloading. no streaming, just a real copy of the movie you just bought.<br />As soon as this and any other UV movie makes the switch, I'll be happy to buy it.

B009B8YZKS|5.0|I have been a fan of the series since its inception. This is the kind of production we have all been waiting for. Not only for backstory but the quality is there. They paid for decent actors and made it a movie quality product. I only hope they go back and complete the saga in Live action format. Master chief is done but as he is not the focus I have to admit they may have underwhelmed me with his physical appearance as far as quality is concerned. BUT if you even slightly like the games this is a must buy!

0930289234|5.0|This book was a very well-plotted, well-written, well-drawn comic. The characters are so rich and deep, they almost leap off of the page. The plot is complex but very well-done. Alan Moore managed to create an entire complex world with only about eleven issues, which is quite impressive. Probably the only thing I don't like about this comic is the break in the plot from the third or fourth issue and going on for about another three or four, where a comic inside a comic is introduced, I realized there were parallels in that story with the main plot but I found it unnecessary and having little to do with anything in the story, and it was pretty boring compared with the rest of the comic. Overall this was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who is either just curious about it or anyone who wants to read a well-done superhero comic.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Seriously. A great series that is so beyond just zombies walking around. The human element to this is what makes the show so great. We hate having to wait a week to watch the next episode!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I loved that it was easy to get and is as always easy to use. I would definately recommend this to anyone who wants to look at pdf files on thier kindle.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This was fun for my grand kids in NC. It keep them entertained and busy while we unpacked their belongings.
0307346617|5.0|This is an interesting read. I got it for my husband and he loves it. I'm waiting for him to finish so I can read it myself. I am very esxited based off of his recaps thus far.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Kudos to G.D. for reverting from their Rock-Opera recent productions back to some good ol' punk rock.  The more you listen the more you appreciate it.  Gonna buy Dos now.  Good job guys!
B004SBX112|5.0|My 8 year old grandson loves this.  Plays each time he comes to my house (which is quite often). So glad we bought this.
0937381888|5.0|Pros: almost every question you could possibly have about home brewing is discussed with a wonderfully intuitive chapter layout.<br /><br />Cons: kegging is not discussed.<br /><br />My first brewing book was The Complete Joy of Homebrewing, which was followed by the companion, designing great beer, brewing classic styles, yeast, & stone's book.<br /><br />While i find all of them useful, How to Brew is the first place (and usually only place) i look when i have a beer question.<br /><br />It's laid out very intuitively, and the first 8 or so pages take you through the entire process, so the new brewer can jump in right away. As chapters progress each element of the first chapter is broken down into greater complexity for beer geeks like me. In other words, this book is great for both the complete novice and professional craft brewer alike.<br /><br />Another perk is that there is a great compendium of tables and figures. There are also appendices covering interesting topics such as how metal affects your beer (and how to clean or passivate it), general cleaning and sanitizing, and some DIY projects.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I was having a bunch of anxiety about life. I read this incredibly insightful book and it helped so much. We all procrastinate and we all have trouble doing what we should be doing. When we are clear about it we're ten times more productive. That's what this book can give you: Focus and determination to get to work on your art, your project, your business. I have given away dozens of these books to friends and to a person they are amazed at how much they got from reading them. Get it now and be happier (and more productive) tomorrow.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|hey, what can I say, looks like good quality, feels like good quality, works great, even though it came from China. I wish Amazon would list country of origin so I could choose. It makes a difference to me.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Amazing predictions and allows me to send texts and type much faster.  I get so frustrated with how slow my wife's iPhone 4S keyboard is compared to swift key.<br /><br />Highly recommended
0884271536|5.0|I have been in the Project Management business fir over 30 years. This book does an excellent job defining Critical Chain vs traditional Critical Path.
B003IHW0GE|5.0|I've read this book many times since I was a child and everytime I read it, I'm reminded how much I love it. This original version for Kindle was just like reading the book in my childhood library.  Thanks for making it available!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book has had me hooked from the beginning and I just purchased book 6 and 7 and can't wait to read those as well!  This is definitely one of the best new series I've stumbled across in a long time.
B009JZTOG8|2.0|Leave it to the guys from Lost to ruin a good premise... Season 1 was wonderful and magical, and then Season 2 just felt like they ran out of storyline and were stalling and hoping no one would notice. Disappointing.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|OK. I'll give 5 stars....<br /><br />I picked this up because of the upcoming movie trailer I saw.<br /><br />The book was a blast!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Everything you love about michael and on blueray.  A must have for michael jackson fans because smooth criminal is the best.
B000YHG72E|5.0|With so many bad productions of &#34;Holiday&#34; movies, Elf is a refreshingly cold blast in the face. It's a happy, feel good movie that simply doesn't disappoint. Good &#34;Spirit&#34; message brought across with levity. I have watched it every year since it came out.
B00442OI1C|5.0|This show was awesome!  It's a shame that it had to end but I guess all good things do.  The quirky humor, great characters  and funny scenarios kept it so interesting.  I miss Chuck!
B0090EIILU|3.0|Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy has been absurd, shocking, disgusting, ridiculous, and lots of fun.  That is, until this release: The Dictator.  It's obvious from the moment the movie starts that \\"the suits\\" got involved in its making and that's never a good thing.  There are many scenes that are just empty of any interest.  I can almost feel Sacha restraining himself to please the board members.<br /><br />Sacha needs to keep total control over his productions so that they may blossom into the awesome sick spectacles they can be.<br /><br />I still recommend seeing it.  Just be warned there are spots where the fail is almost painful.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|I was expecting this book to be a little cheesy and in some places it is.  However, it offers some valuable nuggets of wisdom and is a very easy read.  I would recommend this to others who are trying to tame their finances as a good first place to start.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|The story is fun, exciting, funny, and neatly blends in historical facts.  My wife is not into the Vampire genre but she really loved this movie.  It's simply a ton of fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game and don't buy prize claw before it because coin dozer has it already.you need to do some work to get prize claw on it.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Oh Rod...you can sing any Holiday Song you want to me ....He could turn Mary Had a Little Lamb into the sound track of 50 Shades of Grey! Luv This One!
B009MB682W|5.0|Excellent collection from every James Bond movie to commemorate their 50th anniversary! I absolutely love this album, and would recommend it to any bond fan.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I highly recommend this series; for those that enjoy SCI-FI and Westerns.<br /><br />It's a shame that they canceled the series.
0756697875|5.0|Can't beat it for the price!!  This book sold for $25 at our school book fair.  My son loves it!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I recommend this book to all the readers. The author used his experience in the concentration camps to elevate himself above the day-to-day grinds. His story is a real lesson that would benefit many today as well as future generations.
B005GSVFBE|5.0|I've seen this movie plenty of times. I have it on VHS. I have it on DVD as well.<br /><br />This movie on Blu-ray and 3-D shows just how amazing is to be able to take movie that was made back in the 90s and make it look like it was created this year.<br /><br /> the audio is incredible and sounds like you are in the room with Woody and Buzz.<br /><br /> Toy Story is great as expected and I will be showing it to my kids (when I have them).
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen has written a masterful account of the Navy Seal attack that captured Osama Bin Laden.  I was riveted and couldn't put it down.  It made me appreciate more the risks and sacrifices that all our military endure to ensure our freedom.  I highly recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Update.<br />Very well written stories. All I wanted to do was keep reading. Even when the tale was depressing and things were seemingly going poorly I wanted to get through those parts because I had hope that the truth would prevail. I suppose we really don't know if truth will prevail though. I don't necessarily like an ending that kind of leaves the reader hanging so hopefully there will be more stories with these characters and what's going on in the rest of the silos and whatnot. I would recommend this series, but not to anyone who is sad, depressed, etc because bad things are constantly happening!!! In the end, I'm glad I stumbled across this and am looking forward to more of these wool stories!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I' m only half way through wool 3 so there might be room for improvement....I just stopped reading it to write this review. I've never been compelled enough to write a review before. good or bad. about anything. I couldn't help it with this though.<br /><br />As of right now I am giving Wool a one star rating. not because it's a bad premise, story, writing, idea, or whatever else. it's a one star because it is sooooo grim!!! I compare it to the \\"a song of ice and fire\\" books. after the climactic event (as I will call it to avoid spoiling it) in a game of thrones I couldn't read it for 2 weeks. I eventually got used to expecting stuff like that from grrm, even though I didn't always like it and have put that series on hold halfway through the 4th one.<br /><br />After finishing wool 1 and 2 I thought that things would start to change. halfway through wool 3 and I realized I was wrong...so far. After wool 1 I had to continue to see where things were going. I thought I was hooked and was about to start recommending it to friends. after wool 2 I was saddened. halfway through wool 3 and I'm pretty much pissed off. Mr.howey, I can see where the cynicism comes from. the world is a cruel and harsh place. I know that. I've seen<br /> and dealt with it first hand. I read fiction to get AWAY from that!! I' m not saying I want it to be all rainbows and unicorns, but if this morbid, somber, pessimistic, macabre tale doesn't start having an upturn in the people I am rooting for to be successful I doubt I will finish it. I'm really surprised that 2265 out of 2635 people who reviewed it thinks that it is of a five star nature.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Been a fan since day one when I was 19, but as someone mentioned earlier their downward slide continues.  This is IMO the worst of their work.  I see the vast majority of everyone actually liking it and I cannot seem to wrap my head around that.  There are virtually no traces left of the old LP.  They've \\"changed\\" so much since day one that they're style/identity is hardly recongnizable.  Change is good, but morphing into a fully synthasized/almost non-instrumental group is a change for the worse.  Sorry LP I had high hopes but you've let this fan down again!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Like waking up to the bells in the morning. No I need to get WI-fi in my house.Just to max it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I purchased this app and downloaded onto my cell phone and my Kindle Fire HD. Now I can tell exactly how much longer I can listen to music, watch movies, play games, text, talk and more before I need to recharge my device. It gives a clearer picture than just a percentage and all for $2 is a steal! I highly recommend this app for cell phones and Kindle Fire HE!
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Don't look for history facts, it's pure fun and entertainment, my twilight daughter and i really enjoyed. very well done
B005LAII08|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I left with mixed feelings.  It is NOT your typical Disney princess tale.  There is no falling in love and living happily ever after with the man of her dreams.  But I should not have expected typical with a Pixar production.  If you can leave your expectations at the door, you'll appreciate what this story has to offer: a tale of family love; a girl coming of age and her mother who make choices they both regret; and second chances to make things right.  My daughter loved this tale from the first, and I like Merida as a role model much better that the standard princess role models that are available.  I've seen Brave three times now, and I have to say I have moved from ambivalence to admiration in short order.  And no one can argue that the visual art is stunning.
B008602KQI|5.0|Even though this is just the digital copy that I got with the purchase of the blueray dvd, we still watched it 4 times in 2 weeks.  I had already read the book, which I wish I had seen the movie first then I would have been surprised at all the extra stuff in the book.  Still very enjoyable!
B005LAIH54|4.0|This movie was purchased as a gift for my son, who is really into Greek Mythology right now. It is a good movie that I would recommend for adults and kids alike. It was a very good price and was shipped quickly, so I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B002JMLMKE|5.0|We have already rated and reviewed this product once and didn't think we'd have to do again.  Enjoyable and would recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|5 star book....I loved it! Now I am ready to see the movies, and read the rest if the trilogy.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|*Spoilers Ahead*<br /><br />Well, Pixar has released it's first fantasy film, and despite some bumps along the way, it's a pretty good film. It also gives us Pixar's first princess to join the Disney line-up; Merida. But, let's break it down a little.<br /><br />First, the most important thing, the story. The film is about a rebellious princess (cliche as that may sound) wanting to change her unwanted fate of getting married to someone she's never met. The lengths at which she goes to achieve this however, lead both her and her family down a dangerous path. Sounds simple enough on paper, but there was a lot of twists and turns in the film, that it was almost a little hard to follow at times. Still, the focus of the movie is set on Merida and her relationship with her mother, Queen Elinor, which is a nice touch for Pixar/Disney to finally focus on a mother/daughter relationship this heavily. I'll admit though, when Elinor is transformed into a bear, that just felt a little, random to me. I found myself echoing Merida's \\"Why a bear?\\" line when I saw it happen. This plot point does provide a nice climax at the end though, showing that the curse on Elinor is more dire than they thought at first, and what could happen if they don't find a cure.<br /><br />Next, the characters. A little superficial nitpick, when I saw Merida's hair, I might have been a little happy that finally there was a princess with hair as crazy as mine. But, besides that, she's, well, a little annoying at times (at least to me). I mean, she doesn't want to get married, and acts selfish (which she even admits later on) about the whole situation, and doesn't handle it very well. But, she learns, and grows as a character. The same can be said for Elinor, who scarily reminds me of my mother. The two's relationship is very relateable. Plus, she's the around one of the only queens in Disney who is not evil. Fergus, Merida's father is probably one of my favorite characters, just because he's so crazy and fun. Plus, they got the casting just right for him. Next, is Merida's brothers, who are basically the comic relief, but do a pretty good job at it, having a sort of Tom and Jerry relationship with one of the maids. The lords from the different kingdoms, and their sons, I'd also put on my favorite character list, even though their roles are minor. Just the way their differing personalities cross is enjoyable to watch. The witch (does she have a name?) is OK I guess, but this films got enough quirky characters in it. But, she's only in it for about 10 minutes so, no real harm. And finally, the villain of the film; the demon bear Mor'du. This is the first Pixar or Disney villain for a while, with no real motivations (at least at first). He's akin to the bear in Fox and The Hound, except a tad more vicious. I wasn't really expecting him to be that Prince that was cursed, but I suppose they had to explain his savage nature somehow, and it was a really good payoff. In the end, he's not so much as a villain, just a victim of \\"Ambition is Evil\\". Plus, his design, both bear and Prince, is interesting.<br /><br />Wow, now that the character section's done, let's move on to the design and music, because it's worth talking about. It's one of Pixar's finest special effects work, especially with portraying the landscape. The little details they add, while still pulling away and appreciating the larger scale, is awesome, and it was amazing to see it in 3-D at the cinemas. The music is also creative too, with a few songs by the cast that are both humorous and heartbreaking. There are a few songs by an artist, but, in my opinion, they fit in to the film okay.<br /><br />Lastly, the special features. We watched the behind the scenes stuff, and it was worth checking out. I always love when they add stuff like explanations on how things in the film work. Also, there are a lot of deleted scenes, though their more prominent on the second disc. I have yet to watch the commentary, but I'm thankful it's there so we can get the director's input. Plus, there is the standard Pixar short, \\"La Luna\\" which is amazing, and, like the landscape in the movie was cool to watch in the cinemas, but can still be appreciated on the small screen.<br /><br />So, I think I've ranted enough (actually I think this is my longest review). Overall, this is a decent add to the Pixar lineup, and Merida is a good addition to the Princess line-up. The story can get a little clunky at times, but everything else I think, is worth the price to add to your Disney/Pixar movie collection.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I don't like most super hero movies, got sick of spiderman actually.  Though Robert Downey Jr does such a wonderful job and his personallity really seems to come through on this character.  Great job!  Would highly recommend.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a true Christmas Classic. I bought the Blu-ray version to update the DVD copy I own. I watch this movie every year, just like a classic should be.
B00004NRWH|4.0|If your a Nickelback fan, you will enjoy this CD.  They went from sounding like total grundge to sounding like a band!  Would recommend.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|Just purchased the set upon it's release, so it'll be months before I finish viewing the full-season (am in no hurry to view the tragic episode \\"Shades Of Gray\\" anyway).  Nevertheless, even at this point, I'd have to add my voice to the chorus of reviewers indicating the inferiority of the quality of this release compared to season-one.<br /><br />What is a bit unnerving is that as a TREKfan, I've followed months of interviews published with many of the individuals involved in the process of this season's BluRay-release (the Okuda's for instance).  While they frequently indicated that season-two's work had been outsourced, their reassurance and praise for what they were promoting was unending.  So either it's a lack of objectivity on their parts, that they cannot see what even the least-technical of viewers can easily report, or their desire to promote the sale of this product means they'll say anything.<br /><br />Fortunately I do expect that season-three, now being prepped for release by the same CBS-Digital team that so outstandingly improved season-one, will be quite excellent.  Maybe, by then, we'll hear some collective mea culpa from the powers-that-be over the inferior product which they've released here with season-two.  With season-four also being outsourced, I already worry that it will be a disappointment unless there's an acknowledgement that it needs to be done better.<br /><br />In all fairness, I intend to update my comments after I've seen more of the episodes.  Thanks for taking a moment to consider my opinions.
0307595579|3.0|....I have to admit, not one of the best buys I have made,  I really enjoyed the movie &#34;Girl with The Dragon Tattoo&#34; but had been told ahead of time that the book was a hard read, guess what....it is but it is still a good one.  It took longer than normal to read but was good by the time it ended.  There is alot more in the book than there was in the movie, of course but more than what I would call normal.
B00319ECGK|5.0|this is freakin' great, right now you can get the Blu-ray version of this film along with The Matrix Reloaded / The Matrix Revolutions (Two-Pack) [Blu-ray] all for under $20. where else except through Amazon are you going to find such a great deal on a movie trilogy, especially on Blu-ray??
0385504225|5.0|I have had this book for quite some time but finally read it because the movie has to be coming out pretty soon.  Been 2 years since Angels & Demons, so it is due!  Would recommend to anyone who has enjoyed the first 2 books in this series.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Another gem from Van the Man in the style that I love with a strong jazz influence.  If you liked Poetic Champions compose you'll love this one.<br /><br />Finally if you're a Van fan this is a must in your collection!
B0017T2NG2|5.0|One of the best books read in quite a long time.  Wish I would have seen the movie first but still enjoyed movie also.  Would recommend to anyone.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Pure entertainment.  If you like dark and action...go for it! Harry Hole's exploits and pain are worth the ride. Don't miss this.
0312383320|4.0|With all the spinoffs coming from the Plum series, it's gonna be to much to keep up with.  I enjoyed reading this one but the stories are all starting to sound the same.  Getting old but when your this far into a series, you have to finish.  Would recommend to any Plum fan.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I was not going to watch this; however, my 23 year old daughter convinced me it would be good. Wow! This was a fun movie! I can't believe that I wasn't going to watch it. This was the most fun movie (animated or not) I have watched in a long time. I guess the evil of the characters was...hmmmmm...endearing. The sarcasm was superb. Watch this movie for lots of laughs.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is an all time classic and won't ever lose it's standings as an all time favorite.  I don't watch any of the remakes of the good ole classics....nothing better than a couch with your favorite blanket and a great old movie that you don't have to worry about the content being unexceptable for any child to see.  LOVE THE CLASSICS!!!  :)
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Ooooo, I have not tried to watch a movie as poorly produced as this movie is in a long time. It was painful to watch and I really feel sorry for the actors. The acting was very cheesy. The makeup was awful. The dialog was childish. This was just a very lousy movie. Don't believe me? Watch it for yourself.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Even at his best, Michael Connelly has never been much of a stylist.  His sentences rarely provide pleasure or anything like aesthetic satisfaction, but, like his favorite protagonist, Harry Bosch, his workmanlike prose can normally be counted upon to plug along until his latest challenging case is solved, despite any and all obstacles, criminal, forensic, and bureaucratic, that are placed in his path.  Connelly is always very good at evoking the grubby details of police work, the hard slog and endless hours needed to bring a case to something like a satisfactory conclusion.  Harry Bosch, humorless and driven, is not always easy to like, but in his grim determination to bring about justice for the mute victims of murder that he tirelessly represents, he is an altogether memorable character.<br />  The Black Box marks the 20th year since the first Harry Bosch novel, and Connelly celebrates the anniversary by giving Harry, now working in a special branch of the Los Angeles police devoted to solving cold cases, the opportunity to work again on a case that he briefly encountered 20 years earlier but was unable to solve because it took place during the chaos resulting from the infamous Rodney King riots that paralyzed the city, the murder of a white, Danish journalist in the midst of a black neighborhood then under martial law.  Now, in 2012, the discovery of a gun linked to the old case, enables Harry, aided by forensic advances unimaginable in 1992, to open a new investigation and discover surprising new dimensions to the case.  The police work is solid and convincing, and the narrative, which manages also skillfully to advance the ongoing tale of Bosch's sometimes fraught relationships with his teenage daughter and his psychologist girlfriend as well as to demonstrate his usual impatience with authority, is well developed.  But then, about two thirds of the way through, just as the case is coming together nicely and promising an exciting and satisfactory climax and conclusion, everything falls apart.  The final third of the book is something of a mess, overly melodramatic, rushed, and clumsy.  It's almost as if Connelly, feeling the need to get the book out in time to mark Bosch's 20th anniversary, was unable to take the time needed to finish it properly and fully develop the situation he had so carefully set up.<br />  Ultimately then, The Black Box is rather disappointing.  One can only hope that next time the prolific Connelly, free of anniversary pressure, will take the time and effort to bring his work to a more satisfying conclusion.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is excellent as usual and Mitch Rapp is a great character going above and beyond the politically correct pap we see in Washington at the present time.  Loved it.
B000063V8U|5.0|This item took quite a while to get to me - but it finally arrived. Patrick Stewart is definitely the star - he just makes the whole series. This series is worth while for any trekkie collection.
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|This movies proves the Bourne character goes full circle because some of the memories come back to him little by little.  Then other people help him figure out who he really is.  I personally enjoy suspense trillers that go full circle back to where it started and that happened with this trilogy.  The car chase scene was good in New York but what I enjoyed best was the roof top chase scene with the cops and Bourne.  So if your looking for another great action movie with wonderful acting job by Damon then pick this movie up and enjoy the fight and car chase scenes over and over again.  I enjoy this set time and time again and never grow tired of the set.
0395389496|5.0|This is exactly what I expected. My son is a Polar Express fan, so this will be added to his bookshelf. I'm sure he will want to read it often.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|One of best movies ever made for dialouge and storylines.  The actors amazed me in the whole movie and I watched the orginal 2 hour version then watched the extended cut compare it to 2 hour version and actually enjoy the extra scenes because they added to the storyline.  This is a great dvd set if your a true fan of the sin city stories then pick this movie up and get all the bonus material inculding the grahpic novel in the box with the movies both orginal cut and exyended cut on disc 2.  I never get tired of watching this movie because it keeps my intrest all the way threw start to finish.  You will enjoy it also dont pay attention to other reviews just make up your own mind about the movie and bonus materials, if you like the movie way back when then just get the dvd if you dont have it yet.
B000FC1D0O|5.0|Legendary book you should get your hands on this.  Timeless and humble lessons everyone can learn from.  Some parts get a little weird but take the good out of this, there's a lot of gold nuggets of wisdom here.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I downloaded the free app on my Kindle Fire. It seemed to work pretty well, but would only let me print three pages until it prompted me to pay for the app. I tried to do so, but got a message telling me that the pay version is not available for Kindle. WTH??
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm hooked and find it nearly impossible to wait for the next episode.  It doesn't get any better than that.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I definitely recommend this book.  You will learn much about yourself and others in your life.  It will help you understand how each of communications in very different ways.
B00993FEUK|5.0|This was a requested item that several people wanted to see, and were all over the age of 10.  It appears we're all addicted to the paranormal.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I had this book in my library for awhile and finally decide to read it and I must say that i am glad that i did. If you enjoy sci-fic,/fantasy genre, you most certainly will enjoy this book.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Great western,  Clint Eastwood at his best. This and all of the Sergio leone westerns are awesome. Great buy. Done
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because It sharpens some blades but not others. It does an amazing sharpening job thougth. Especially the diamond dusted rod.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I think the cover is well made and works beautifully.  Very handy and very necessary to have a sleeve for the Kindle.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|i bought this for myself since im a harry potter geek and i love it so much. it does everything you could want and works flawlessly. this is a great gift for anyone that likes harry potter or just magic in gerneral.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great! you can put muliti places in - hourly- daily-15 day. I have all inportant to me places on there. Very happy
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I play this several times a week. It is great for sitting in lobby's or while waiting for a doctors appointment
B002ZG9968|5.0|I LOVE THIS CUTE FILM. IT IS ROMANTIC BUT SOO FUNNY. IM NOT ONE FOR MUSHY OR SAPPY MOVIES AND I THOUGHT WHEN I GOT STUCK WATCHING THIS WITH MY SISTER I WAS GOING TO HATE IT. I LOVED THE MOVIE SO MUCH I BOUGHT IT...LOTS OF LAUGHS!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read all three books. Personally I can't see how one can read the first book and then stop!! Yes it is that good.
B008D36INE|3.0|I didnt love the movie because it was so depressing.  But for those who have been in a love-hate, lust-filled relationship before it will make perfect sense and is very believeable and relatable.  The acting was amazing by Rachel Weisz.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book, even bought the next two books before finishing this one. Looking forward to eventually viewing the movie - yet, I strongly recommend reading this first!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is a great read.  I usually don't care for magic and fantasy because it is usually for the younger crowd but this caught my attention right away and I had trouble putting the book down when I had to.  I thought it was very well written and a fun story.
B0012YYZYK|4.0|The concert is here along with the movie, which is good news.  However, this is NOT the 2 disc special released on standard dvd version.  Example:  \\" Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a performance from the second sold out Madison Square Garden concert.  I'm not complaining, as I still own 2 disc version. The color, sound and dvd quality is great on blue ray.  I would definitely recommend it but wanted all Led Zeppelin fans to know, this disc is somewhat different from the original.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|The video and soundtrack are a must! If you like the Beatles then you will thoroughly enjoy Across the Universe.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|THIS CALCULATOR IS SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT CAME WITH MY IPHONE.  EASY AND QUICK TO USE.  LARGE ENOUGH FONT THAT MY TIRED EYES DON'T HAVE TO SQUINT.
0547564651|4.0|After devouring \\"Brain Rules for Baby\\" like a hot-out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookie, I spied the title \\"How Children Succeed\\" and scarfed up Paul Tough's latest journalistic endeavor; it was like expecting a chips ahoy and sinking my teeth into a kettle chip.<br /><br />You see, \\"How Children Succeed\\" is not a parenting book.  Tough offers only a few pieces of broad strokes guidance.  He states: \\"[S]cientists have demonstrated that the most reliable way to produce an adult who is brave and curious and kind and prudent is to ensure that when he is an infant, his hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functions well.  And how do you do that?  It is not magic.  First, as much as possible, you protect him from serious trauma and chronic stress; then, even more important, you provide him with a secure, nurturing relationship with at least one parent and ideally two.\\"  Tough also cautions us parents to balance \\"our urge to provide everything for our child, to protect him from all harm\\" against \\"our knowledge that if we really want him to succeed, we need to first let him fail.\\"  That's it, folks.  Parents searching for new ideas or practical tips will be disappointed.<br /><br />But those who remember a time when they cared about other people's children will eat up what is essentially Tough's second book-length New Yorker article examining the intersection of education and poverty (the first, \\"Whatever It Takes,\\" is arguably an even more interesting read).  The bulk of the book tells the scientific and historical story of \\"character education\\" in U.S. schools.  To summarize in a patchwork of Tough's words, character strengths like grit and curiosity \\"matter . . . to young people's success,\\" \\"are not innate\\" or genetic but rather \\"are rooted in brain chemistry [and] . . . molded, in measurable and predictable ways, by the environment in which children grow up,\\" and even after the most formative years \\"are very much changeable - entirely malleable, in fact. . . .  They are skills you can learn; they are skills you can practice; and they are skills you can teach.\\"  And Tough tells fascinating tales about a handful of educators and community service providers trying to ensure that process happens.<br /><br />Tough skillfully splices their stories together and distills complicated concepts into easily digestible explanations (e.g., \\"mental contrasting . . . means concentrating on a positive outcome and simultaneously concentrating on the obstacles in the way\\"), classifications (e.g., \\"Rules . . . are not the same as willpower.  They are a metacognitive substitute for willpower.\\"), and analogies (his Napoleon/marshmallow extended metaphor was intellectually delectable), all the while serving up engaging prose (e.g., \\"He is a classic academic intellectual, his glasses thick, his IQ stratospheric, his shirt pocket bristling with mechanical pencils.\\").skills you can learn; they are skills you can practice; and they are skills you can teach.\\"  And Tough tells fascinating tales about a handful of educators and community service providers trying to ensure that process happens.<br /><br />Tough skillfully splices their stories together and distills complicated concepts into easily digestible explanations (e.g., \\"mental contrasting . . . means concentrating on a positive outcome and simultaneously concentrating on the obstacles in the way\\"), classifications (e.g., \\"Rules . . . are not the same as willpower.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|FROM HIS AUDITION AND THROUGH EVERY WEEK, I WAS VOTING FOR PHILLIP PHILLIPS.  HIS VOICE AND STYLE OF PLAYING MUSIC SET HIM ABOVE MANY OF THE NEW ARTISITS OF TODAY.  I ALSO DOWNLOADED EVERY SONG FROM THE WEEKS OF AMERICAN IDOL.
B004BVKE1Y|5.0|i love this record  everything thats great about rory gallagher is here  the passion the songs  the guitar playing this is more acoustic than his other records  but its also a very melodic record  im not awake yet and out of my mind are great examples he didnt use the studio like hendrix did  what you hear is what you get with rory just like his live shows dont hesitate to buy this hes one of the most under rated musicians when you mention the great guitar players
B00936A0RU|5.0|I am a fan of &#34;based on a true story&#34; type movies, as well as a big Tom Hardy fan. I loved this movie! It never ceases to amaze me of the acting capabilities of Tom Hardy! I highly recommend it!

B009NQKXYK|5.0|This movie is AMAZING! Whether you're a fan of the world and mythology of Ridley Scott or you're coming to it for the first time, this Alien prequel is a stand alone classic. Everything from performances to special effects was flawless. The story is terrific, and the ability (via Amazon Instant Video) to watch it directly to my HDTV was an awesome way to see it. GREAT GREAT GREAT!
B0043LYXJ6|5.0|Amazing Movie Series!<br /><br />It was a great viewing for sure.  Definitely worth your time to check it out. :) :)
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is very cute, but the message is a little strange and hard to grasp for young children. The self-important and courageous Merida disobeys and intentionally harms her mother, and her attitude isn't something you'd want your 5-year-old to model, but overall it was a cute, ultimately heart-warming story of failure and redemption.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is the perfect app for anyone who needs an alarm clock. It works the way you want it to and how you want it to.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A true classic (1956) that raised the bar at a time when science fiction movies were stuck in the giant bugs and lizards theme.  Excellent plot line following Shakespeare's Tempest.  Believable acting with just a smattering of 50's camp dialog.  The extras point out exactly how important a milestone this movie was for the time it was released.  It wasn't matched in quality until &#34;2001 A Space Odyssey&#34;.  Was nice to hear Spielberg and Lucas comment on how they were inspired by this movie in their youth.<br /><br />If you have an appreciation for quality classic science fiction then this will certainly be a joy to watch.  Or watch again, as many will have seen multiple times over the decades.

B009GX6600|3.0|I've noticed that something is different than the preceeding seasons.  I don't know whether the director(s) have changed or the writers no longer have the spark but something is different this year and it results in a less compelling storyline and acting.  Something is just out of sync with season 10.

B004Z2TUGE|4.0|A little slow in the beginning.  Very good special effects and surprising good acting.  The story is not as compelling as it could be but once it gets going it holds your interest.  I would like to watch it again.
B000OBYLVO|3.0|This movie is great but I was hoping to watch it on my android tablet but there is no app and I got an error message stating that I needed a different flash player to watch it through my browser even though I have most up to date versio, and I can't download it on my pc and transfer it over because it is protected.  Plus, once I discovered all of this I couldn't find a way to return it.  I will probably just delete it.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This Kindle ebook contained way more information than expected and in a wide range of areas. It is a very complete introduction to pretty much the world of Tim Ferris.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Our 10-year old granddaughter had put this movie on her wish list. You would not believe the smile on her face when she opened it up. Pure delight on our part.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these books. I'm just kind of sad that I finished the last one the other night. These are those kind of stories that I will enjoy reading again in a couple years or so. I liked that there was a little bit of everything in this trilogy and made it hard to put down. All I can say is I LOVE THIS TRILOGY!!! Great job E L James.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|***Great movie. Loved the action and with all the big star actors/ actresses cast in it, I knew it had to be exceptional.
0321525655|5.0|ABOUT THE BOOK<br />The book begins with the expression: \\"This book is designed to develop the approach to the presentation but not on its method of preparation.\\"<br />Overall, the book is about to change the reader's approach to the slide design and preparation and the presentation as a tool for transfer of message. the main stress is put on ZEN philosophy as a tool for creating best presentations you have ever done.<br />Book is written in the logical sequence of preparation of the presentation. Main chapters: planning, design, presentation/look. A special attention (and chapter) is paid at a slide design preparation. It discuss topics such as simplicity, naturalness and elegance.<br />Book is rich of examples of actual presentations, full of famous speakers and communication gurus' quotes. The book is easy to read, clearly logical contents allows navigate easy according to the needs. The book can be read and not sequentially, but by the selected thematic part. There are chapter summaries of the most important things to note at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />This book follows up on global trends in modern communication, so it can be learned from it a lot.<br /><br />INTERESTING EXTRACTS<br />Design starts at the beginning, not at the end; it's not an afterthought. If you use slide-ware in your presentation, the design of those visuals begins in the preparation stage before you have even turned on your computer.<br /><br />Degradation to the visual message can occur in many ways, such as with the selection of inappropriate charts, using ambiguous labels and icons, or unnecessarily emphasizing items such as lines, shapes, symbols, and logos that do not play a key role in support of the message. In other words, if the item can be removed without compromising the visual message, then strong consideration should be given to minimizing the element or removing it altogether.<br /><br />Empty space (also called negative space or white space) is a concept that is supremely simple, yet the most difficult for people to apply. Whether people are designing a document or a slide, the urge to fill empty areas with more elements is just too great. One of the biggest mistakes that typical business people make with presentation slides (and documents as well) is going out of their way to seemingly use every centimeter of space on a page, filling it up with text, boxes, clip art, charts, footers, and the ubiquitous company logo.<br />Empty space implies elegance and clarity. This is true with graphic design, but you can see the importance of space (both visual and physical) in the context of, say, interior design as well. High-end brand shops are always designed to create as much open space as possible. Empty space can convey a feeling of high quality, sophistication, and importance.<br /><br />PROS<br />Many chapters are prepared as methodological material and intended for direct application of knowledge in practice.<br />The examples provided forms the taste of good and bad presentation.<br /><br />CONS<br />Some chapters are vague and related more to the author's philosophical reflections on the principles of making a good presentation what seems author wanted just to expand the contents of the book.<br /><br />RECOMMEND<br />I would recommend everyone to read the chapter about the design. This is a new approach to the slide preparation and use. After this book i have changed my slide design completely.emely simple, yet the most difficult for people to apply.

B001PTG4BO|5.0|ABOUT THE BOOK<br />This is one of the best seller books of the last decade. This book analyzes e-business as a branch and its influence to \\"regular business\\".<br />The main idea of ​​the book - the more different and niche products are created and sold in the interned the longer the retail is growing. The tail causes bigger amount of incoming \\"players\\" and a wider range of product availability.<br /><br />Book from the very first pages involves you with interesting analysis and observations. The first few chapters of the book are about the electronic market analysis where author comes with the conclusion that in e-world Paret's Law (80/20 rule) is slightly different and it becomes 98% rule, where 2% products are known as hits and sold in thousands of units, while the remaining 98% of the production of individual units are sold only a few times. Author provides some charts (Rhapsody, Netflix, Amazon offered products analysis). Author points out that the most popular market goods are only 2 to 5 percent of the whole offer of goods. The rest mass of products are bought a very little quantities.<br /><br />Nevertheless, e-platform enables manufacturers to increase the marginal cost of supply without the need for additional storage, packaging and other physical attributes specific to the regular business. According to the author e-platform is an excellent medium for the most radical and unexpected ideas that can be sold.<br /><br />The following chapters provide detailed description of hit and nonhit product types. The book provides detailed analysis of the last decade trends in the music publishing industry. you can find music artist albums sales drops and causes of changes in the publishing business with new technology (iPods, cell phones) empowered to broadcast music in a wider range of channels.<br /><br />Further chapters describes the e-business models which are composed of the following types: a new generation of producers (the wikipedia phenomenon, e-publishing, remixes), the new market (product placement by the help of aggregators), the new market consumers(indie music listeners, low budget movies watchers)<br /><br />to compare e-business and non e-business author compares e-business retailers business branch. Here author finds differences between 1 inch price strategy of shelve in retailers shop and immense e-business platform.<br /><br />The last chapters of the book sums up the world of e-business niches and its culture.<br /><br />INTERESTING EXTRACTS<br /><br />The author presents three factors of the long tail that enable the market to receive non mass-produced products. But for that to happen it is important to happen an economic reasons - reduced cost of to reach niche market. If this assumption is implemented then the follows these long tail factors:<br /><br />Democratic means of production (eg personal computers)<br />Consumer cost savings while democratizing the distribution (eg the Internet)<br />Connection of supply and demand (eg Google search, iTunes recommendations, blogs).<br /><br />Business aggregators are divided into five categories:<br />* Physical goods (Amazon, Ebay)<br />* Digital products (i Tunes, iFilm)<br />* Advertising / services (google, craiglist)<br />* Information (google, wikipedia)<br />* Community / user-generated content (MySpace, Bloglines, Facebook)<br /><br />Nine rules for success in the long tail aggregator:<br />Reduce the cost of the product<br />1. Move reserves inwards or outwards<br />2. Let the consumers to do the work<br />Think of niche<br />3. Not everywhere fits the same distribution method<br />4. Not everyone fits the same product<br />5. Not everyone fits the same price<br />Reduce the control<br />6. Share the information<br />7. Think \\"and\\" but not \\"or\\"<br />8.

0066620996|5.0|ABOUT THE BOOK<br />This is a book about the survey results and analysis reports. The study was carried out for five years, it took 15,000 hours and a number of human resources.<br />This book is the continue of book of the same author \\"Built to Last\\" (how to build a successful company).<br />The project which is described in the book had been working on the areas: leadership (known as Level 5 Leadership), team management, \\"Hedgehog\\" concept, culture of discipline and technology.<br />The author argues that, first, the company's success depends on the level 5 leadership (this result surprised even the researchers themselves), where the leader is a functional rather than political (leaders stars) person. Another important study finding was related to the company-Hedgehog concept which means that only one occupation of company can be a core competence. The author says that event the company is working on a product or service for decades does not mean that this is a core competence of the company and the company is the leader in particular business branch. The author also argues that if the occupation of the company can not make it business branch leader it should be changes otherwise it will not create strong competence based company so the company has to replace the competence immediately.<br />The author of the book also describes all research outcomes what they found the company makes business branch leader and lets it to prosper for decades.<br /><br />INTERESTING EXTRACTS<br />First who... then what. We expected that good-to-great leaders would begin to by setting a new vision and strategy. We found instead that they first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats - and then they figured out where to drive it. The old adage \\"people are your most important asset\\" turns out to be wrong. People are not your most important asset. The right people are.<br /><br />A culture of discipline. All companies have a culture, some companies have discipline, but few companies have a culture of discipline. When you have disciplined people, you don't need hierarchy. When you have disciplined thought, you don't need bureaucracy. When you have disciplined action, you don't need excessive controls. When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great performance.<br /><br />Ten out of eleven good-to-great CEOs came from inside the company, three of them by family inheritance. The comparison companies turned out to outsiders with six times greater frequency -yet they failed to produce sustained great results.<br /><br />PROS<br />The book is written in easily reading language.<br />The research findings and outcomes changes the approach to business management.<br />The annexes details the feasibility of the study.<br />At the end of each chapter, the key chapter ideas are provided.<br /><br />CONS<br />this is a book about the research so it is more scientific approach issue than reading before sleep.<br /><br />RECOMMEND<br />This is classics of management. A must reading for everyone interested in modern business management. This book should please those who are just interested in management and those already having connections with it.culture, some companies have discipline, but few companies have a culture of discipline.

B0071T4BVC|4.0|When I first listened to the album I found myself undecided whether I was happy with the purchased it or not.  After the second listen I was intrigued and after the third listen I was glad I was well satisfied.  Though a different venue for Mr. McCartney he is still alive and well among the songs.  I like a risk taker and I believe this risk paid off.  It did for me.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Better than the first. A need to see movie here. Would recommend for all that loves action movies of all ages
B004EPYZUS|2.0|I purchased this as a gift and was pretty disappointed. Upon receiving it the movie case was disfigured and the cover was rippling and bulging in places. I didn't have time to return it  before I gifted it (bad on my part), but if it won't play for my friend, it will be returned.
0545265355|4.0|Well written and has great character development. The storyline is a little macabre for my taste but I was willing to power through through it and enjoy it for it's other aspects.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|after 2 previous movies, I thought the third would be a waste of time-I was so wrong! #3 is just as good-if not better- than the first 2. I enjoyed this immensely.......
B008M87GJK|4.0|The British external, un-influenced news-reporting of American politics is more objective and honest.<br />The news is up-to-date and accurate. Better than the NYT.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Best purchase i had ever made. Money well spent. This cd is always on replay for me. My song is &#34;I wont go&#34;. Every time i listen this cd i cry.  I jus love her voice and how she speaks to me with her words.

B008BU70HW|5.0|I can't wait for the third year to start.  This book help to fill in the time.  I love all the pictures of both people and things the used back then.  Anyone who is hooked on the series all love it.  It's about my favorite series.  It is intereresting to see how the sort line developed each year.  Just a great companion for the series.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This camera is very easy to use.  It is simple and the pictures have a great quality to them.  My 2 year old daughter loves to use it and take pictures of herself.

B000AP04OM|4.0|There was on part where the movie skipped i didnt see any scratches on the disc but the kids enjoyed the movie
B0081L37Z0|3.0|I like the fact that they made this action tv series into a comedy.  But it was NOT that funny!  It was a movie that it is not worth $10 at the theater. Acting was OK, action was OK and jokes were only good at times.  And the ending was just too predictably!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Great stop-motion animated film! Great for all ages. If you liked Chicken Run or any of the Wallace and Gromit movies, I recommend this movie to you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It seems like bashing 50 Shades of Grey is such a commonplace thing to do these days. Therefore I am writing the ultimate rebuttal. First of all, people bash 50 Shades because they think it's such a hip and cool thing to do. Some people enjoy trashing the success of a popular author. Oftentimes they have very poor reasons for their argument.<br /><br />Claim#1: \\"I refuse to finish the book because it's so bad.\\"<br />My Rebuttal: Those type of reviews automatically fall into the category of \\"false\\" reviews. If the reviewer doesn't bother reading the entire book, then how does the reviewer know exactly what's in the book? Those types of reviewers should never bother writing a review in the first place. We should never bother reading their reviews. How can a teacher give a \\"F\\" on a paper if the teacher only reads the first paragraph? That's exactly what those reviewers are doing. In my opinion, I think all those reviews should be tossed out.<br /><br />Claim#2: \\"The writing in 50 Shades is so bad. There are other erotica novels out there with good writing.\\"<br />My Rebuttal: People do not read books for good writing. People read books to be entertained. 50 Shades provides an escape from reality and does a great job doing so! Who wouldn't want to date a hot, tormented billionaire? If you want to read good writing, then go read a grammar book. I'm sure it must be very entertaining...not!<br /><br />Claim#3: \\"Publishing houses shouldn't publish this crap.\\"<br />My Rebuttal: Then what should they publish? Good books that don't sell? Writing is a business. Publishing houses want to publish a book that can sell. They are driven by profit which is not a bad thing in this day in age. Everyone wants to succeed so why shouldn't they? Of course there may be authors who spent years honing their craft only to see their books go out of print. Guess what? It's life. Publishing houses want to look for the next big trend. First, it was wizards. Next, it was vampires. Now it's erotica.It's all about being at the right place at the right time.<br /><br />I'm happy for EL James' success. I wish to thank her for creating a seductive Christian Grey who millions of women can fantasize about. James really nailed it. That explains why her books are flying off the shelves.
B004PAHZMC|3.0|It looks good, it could be sturdier and I wish it were larger, the pics make it seem larger than it actually is.  Shipping was quick though and well packaged.  I'd shop with this company again.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Nice to keep in touch with family & friends in a humorous situation.<br />Draw? hardly with the size of the pallet vs the size of your fingers.<br />But it's fun to try and it stretches your brain to figure out how to make your messy drawing recognizable
B002QRWJA4|5.0|one of my all time favorite movies. I am a huge fan of Gerard Butler and yes he can sing
B0053O89IS|5.0|Love watching this television show. I'm glad the show puts just enough emphasis on the baby storyline and keeps the focus on the crime/forensics angle. Shortest season  so far, but, worth watching.
B000ADWDF2|5.0|Absolutely wonderful performances by everyone in the small cast.  I loved that this movie focused on a few characters, allowing for character development and for the viewer to get to know them well.
B000I186FW|5.0|Thought it was well done considering it didn't have a huge, huge budget. Any fan of the comic books should love the movie.
B009B0CZXU|5.0|A great album from Bat for Lashes.  My favorite tracks are Lilies and Winter Fields, but all of the songs are quality.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this looks amazing! I am going to buy this as soon ad I get money<br />.. looks so much fun!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|this book started out kind of dull but there are some funny spots in it. then in the end you need to get the next book so that you aren't in suspens anymore
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works as advertised. Radar loads pretty slowly, but that's not really a problem. Hey, it's free; you get what you pay for.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I feel that the book is not as good as they were made out to be.  The book is good though
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is a violent movie (beheadings with blood shooting out), but it's kind of comical.  The violence/fighting is so abundant, it's almost tongue in cheek.  It's a great plot, with the gratuitous violence thrown in, almost as a joke.  It's worth watching if you like Quentin Tarantino movies.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this book left you wanting to read the next book asap because the cliffhanger at the end. You just need to know what happens next
B00005JMUA|5.0|Watch Kill Bill volume 1 before watching this.<br />If you liked volume 1, you will like this.<br />Lots more amusing characters, with plenty of tongue in cheek violence.
0316069434|4.0|Harry is back and meticulously, piece by piece, he unravels a 20 year old murder.  Common sense tells you that this will take time, and it does.  The payoff is there and justice is done but only because there is someone who will not give up.  In the end, solving the case doesn't change things much.  There's little if any \\"closure\\".  As Jake Gittes would say, \\"It never goes away\\".  I can't say this is the best Bosch book but it's still quite good.
1594744769|4.0|I usually read my books on my Kindle but I am very glad, having read previous reviews, that I purchased the actual book. I found it used for a very reasonable price. The pictures alone are fun and bizarre even if you never read the book, but then you must of course read the book! The plot is wonderfully strange and the author clearly has an incredible imagination but the story works and the reader is led on a very fun journey. The ending is just a tad abrupt but if there are more pictures, there is room for a sequel...
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great story plus great acting!  After finishing one episode you can't wait for the next!  Watch it, you'll be glad you did.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Oh my. A town of sad, bitter, emotionally stunted, tainted, tragic characters. This kind of story line is the reason I rarely read much contemporary fiction. Everything is so down-in-the-mouth and everyone is so disfunctional. Lots of characterization and very little action which worked because Rowling is very good at using motive to move the story. If you read Harry Potter, the people in this book are nearly all Dursley types...well drawn but just so awful. There are a few sympathetic characters but you just know something terrible is going to happen to them. I read 3/4 of the book then happened upon a review of it in the New York Times which gave away the ending and I was grateful that I did not have to read the horrifyingly sad end to this sad book.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I watched the mini-series and enjoyed it. I wanted to read the book to see how much I missed and how differently it played out. While the writing is not the best and the book bogs down in parts I am enjoying it and will likely try the next of these books.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|By now nearly everyone knows the plot line of this series. Add me to the list of those who enjoyed the books much more than I ever thought I would. Surprisingly memorable. They linger.
0743201140|1.0|The content is worthwhile and I would have definitely provided a higher rating (likely a 4).<br /><br />However I am baffled as to why the publisher does not offer a kindle version.  And even worse there is no option to take the Strengthfinders test (which is mandatory for understanding the material) if you have purchased a used book or were given the book from a friend or colleague.<br /><br />Gallup should be doing its part to improve the environment and reduce their footprint.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Just an intriguing concept and one that is well executed. My husband found a bit of a &#34;Groundhog Day&#34; quality he did not love, but although there is repetition, it is an integral part of the story. Also love a story with a twist and this one is a humdinger! Fun, fun read!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game gets 5 stars plus. Positively addictive! First levels easy but they get harder as you unlock new levels.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|No thank you. So talked about. What a coup for the author. Any chatter is good chatter. I understand the intrigue it just wasn't my cup of tea.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I purchased this movie many years ago and have been very pleased with my purchase. While there are many fun songs and the story is for kids, I find there are many scenes within this story that can speak to my congregation as a pastor.<br /><br />What does it mean to be a Prince growing up to become a King?<br /><br />In the story of our lives, the story of good and evil, of obedience and disobedience, even the story of forgiveness and redemption, this particular movie works very well.<br /><br />Of all of the Disney movies, this is the one that I have found most intriguing and relevant.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I like P.D. James and wanted to sample her foray into a slightly different genre. I'm sure she had fun writing this and as I am also an Austin fan, it was pleasant to read one author's nod to another. Take it for what it is and don't try to make too many comparisons or read too much into it. Just enjoy the story and the characters. James always writes a good story.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I really like this game. It s fun but I don't like the fact that it doesn't have free run. If it did this would have six stars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a creative story. The synopses of this book/series do not do them justice. It is hard to understand how mesmerizing they are and a description of the plot just sounds lame. It's a series you just have to jump into with blind faith.
B0091LS07E|5.0|First alicia keyes album ihave bought and she is fantastic.  The entire album is great and not one bad song on it.  Girl you really are on fire with this album
B003O86FMW|5.0|A I write for all the Hunger Games trilogy books, I am a fan. I was hesitant to read these until I finally read the first one and then I couldn't stop. Mesmerizing.
B009C5Z112|5.0|Wintersun - Time has been in the works for about six years.<br /><br />But it was due to some technical difficulties with technology.<br /><br />Never the less Time: Part 1 was finally released and it's absolutely EPIC!<br /><br />This music is so good that I actually cried to it. It's so beautiful and epic!<br /><br />It went past my expectations. There are some beautiful melodies of japanese influence and the Orchestra's and choirs are just Epic (it's the only word that describes it). Hans Zimmer has some competition now (though music isn't a competition).<br /><br />The guitars are great as expected (though some think there is a lack of \\"riffs\\" and \\"solos\\"). Though myself I was satisfied more and more as I listened.<br /><br />While some people say the album is not totally properly mixed. I myself don't think much of it...due to the fact that this album is something that no one has done before. Jari worked very hard and created an incredible album. It has emotion, epic music, and great versatility.<br /><br />I find this album one of the beautiful albums I have ever heard and it is in my top 5 albums ever.<br />This album definitely was the album of the year (imo) and bar for metal has been set way higher.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Almost Dickensian in its color. An unusual and deftly woven story with sympathetic is bizarre characters. The story unfolds bit by bit and you are drawn into the world of the magical Night Circus. I suppose the ending was logical but not satisfying to me, but then I like endings that are tied up in a neat bow.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Had more than enough room and compartments for my Nikon SLR camera and my waterproof Olympus TG-1 camera plus all their accessories! Plenty of cushion to protect my gear too. Loved the price too BestBuy had similar items for $60+.<br />The inner larger compartment has Velcro dividers that allows the owner to adjust according to needs.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|I suppose this was really a very well written book. It was expert at evoking some very powerful emotions. If you've lost someone close to you recently, you might want to wait a while to read this. Heart rending but a very suspenseful thriller. It's just not the kind of book I like...too sad for me.
B00795P4EG|5.0|Pretty amazing-- can't imagine not having this w/ all the the art/photo stuff I do on my kfire. Only glitches-- sometimes when you 'double' apply-- the 'use' buttons disappear or 'quit' comes on-- just tap the screen anywhere &amp; your functions pop back up. And really tedious to use for very small fixes in very tight spots. Still 5 stars-- great app!
B002N83H1G|2.0|I was seeing a wonderful, scary thriller hiding in the first part of this book...very Michael Douglas and Glenn Close but that possibility just blew right by and the story went absolutely nowhere. Aaarrgh!!!
0307596885|5.0|I read quite a few excerpts of these short stories in The New Yorker but I still thoroughly enjoyed each short story.
0345455681|4.0|It took me a long time to finish because I would read other books in between sections, but I really enjoyed so much of what I learned. Although a novel, it is clearly written around historical fact and is, for the most part, a very pleasant way to learn the history of this incredible city. Sometimes I did feel the author had discovered facts he just thought were so interesting he added them and than tried to fit the story around them and that was not nearly as effective as when the facts flowed through the narrative. I especially enjoyed the part about the evolution of various words and surnames since I have a great fascination for the evolution of the english language. A good read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great for all ages,  addicting, simple to play,  and nothing you wouldn't want a kid to see. overall great game,  and it is free!!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Easy to follow and play. Fast download and great price. Get It because you won't be disappointed with your purchase.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Another great concert by a master, and his band is great. Excellent song selection, mix and energy. Get it...you'll love it.
B008NMT684|3.0|My 3 year old enjoyed going through the puzzles. There is easy, medium, and difficult. However, once he completed each puzzle he got bored and did not want to play again
B001HQZJPM|4.0|Affordable price for an exciting series of movies that are infused with the spirit of adventure and an exotic atmosphere.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love this book..To me, its a cross between a Harry Potter and Percy Jackson book. Keeping it interesting!  I will be reading all six books.Good read!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This series would fascinate the scholar and fan of the pioneer age in the U.S. The product comes at an affordable price, too.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|It's great to be able to go on an adventure with Cheryl. While her current life is dramatically influx, the solutions we all need are so much simpler than we would allow ourselves to believe. I'm not sure if I can stop myself from dreaming of hiking the PCT myself one day.
0810995522|5.0|My son has the whole collection and he really likes the books. Hope there will be much more to buy, cause we got already all of them.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Husband started watching this first.  I was skeptical, but once I started watching I loved it!  Now, have to have every season!
0316227706|5.0|we love the pictures, the are soo much fun!! My friend organized a exhibition for Seth Casteel in Vienna Austria and we felt in love with his puppies.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The best, most original album I've bought in years.  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are amazing and they have mastered how to be successful in the modern era of the music industry by using social media and viral videos.
1419705849|5.0|My 4th grader has waited patiently for this next book in the series. She enjoyed it just as much as the previous 6 books.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am addicted to ebay and this App makes getting to my account so easy.  I get some really great buys on Ebay and I love the bidding wars.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love the cut the rope games. They r cute and make you think. lol My boys are eight and five and they can't get enough of these games, also.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|&#34;Moonrise Kingdom&#34; was one of the best films of the year and my daughter is delighted to have her own copy.<br />It was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great show, hooked on it. Great acting great quality of DVD. Will most certainly buy the second episodes when they are available
B009DJB9HC|5.0|I was waiting, with great expectations, for this album to come out.  Black Country Communion never fails to deliver great music!
B000002UZ1|5.0|I bought this FAB compilation by the FAB FOUR along with two other very comprehensive 60s compilation packs and have probably all the music I could possibly handle for some research I'm doing towards a stage play I'm writing set in the Swingin' 60s! Amazon is a great One Port Call for all my needs neatly taken care of in a trice! Delighted!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved it.  Kyle has quite a story, and it was interesting to read of his background, training, and wartime exploits.  A great read.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I love this film and actor.  I showed it to my HS students and they loved it.  They sat through a silent, black and white movie and most loved it.
B009LRE040|1.0|Batman Begins was an \\"OK\\" movie in my mind. I wasn't in love with it but I didn't totally hate it. The Dark Knight was an amazing masterpiece of a movie. I've watched it several times over and over again. Can't say enough good things about it. I was pretty excited to finally watch The Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />Last night I rented The Dark Knight Rises from Amazon Instant Video. I was so bored by the beginning of the movie that by the time the action picked up towards the end I just didn't care. The ending credits couldn't come fast enough. It took forever for anything interesting to happen and when an action scene did happen it was over with too quickly and honestly I didn't care at all for the characters. In The Dark Knight I really felt for Batman, Harvey, Gordon and Rachel. I even felt the terror that all of Gotham felt regarding the Joker. I felt that Bruce Wayne/Batman was just a wimp in this movie. Gordon played a very small part of the movie, Harvey isn't around since he died in the last movie (same with Rachel). The destruction that Bane brought was big but I just didn't feel the terror from the citizens of Gotham like I did when Joker was running things.<br /><br />I'll never be seeing this movie again.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp's pursuit of Rickman is typical Rapp, shoot first and ask questions later. As a St. Paulite myself, I find any book by Vince Flynn to be at times compicated, but on the other hand, oh so intriguing. A must read for Rapp fans.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this app for a great different solitair game. Just enough challenge to make it engaging, but not too much that a player can't win.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I have been playing the Dice w/Buddies Free version for months, and I absolutely love it! I am excited to get the ad-free version without paying for it today. To the people posting about the \\"excessive\\" permissions, keep in mind that this is a game you play versus other people (like your Facebook friends, random friends, etc.), just like Words with Friends and the like. The permissions use the internet connection for obvious reasons (it's an online game), the email is required so you can have a unique username/account, and the access to your phone's contacts is so that you can invite friends to play the game with you. Seriously, if you like Yahtzee, you'll love this game. It's an easy way to pass time, even if you only have a few minutes to play. Originally, I was going to rate it with 4 stars, because the ads in the free version really slow it down. But this is the ad-free version, so that problem is gone! 5 stars have been earned! I would like to see more games like this!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Was it as good as the first, I don't know.  The first one was so good that I exspected a lot more from 2  But it is still worth watching at least twice.  I think it was good.
1451695195|5.0|My 37 year-old daughter sent me a link to this book four weeks ago. She knows I have read much of what constitutes the NDE (near death experience) literature including arguably the most comprehensive one by a Dutch cardiologist.<br /><br />How I wanted to believe, but my conventional scientific mindset ultimately blocked the process.<br /><br />The minute I saw Dr. Alexander's bow tie, I was turned off. Yes, it is personal. I've worked with two physicians who wore bow ties habitually and, as fate would have it, both of them left a great deal to be desired. Their primary drawback was self esteem out of proportion to their abilities and accompanying arrogance. For me, a bow tie was a 100% sensitive and 90% specific marker for someone from who I had nothing to learn.<br /><br />So much for my former \\"bow tie disdain syndrome.\\"<br /><br />Recently, in the throes of another bout of spiritual angst (if there is a God and soul, why can't I find them?), I opened an issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association and my eyes immediately fell upon a sentence from a review of a book for hospice workers. The sentence read, give or take, something like this: \\"science will never be able to prove or disprove the existence of God.\\" Mind you, time is precious at my age and I never read these reviews, but on this occasion this was the first thing my vision alighted upon!<br /><br />Such a simple statement served to refocus me, and that is when I bit the proverbial bullet and bought Dr. Alexander's book...actually, at a bookstore rather than here where I buy 90% of my books (I decided not to wait lest the flame expire!).<br /><br />You want to say that, forgive the pun, all of this is in the author's \\"head\\" and not grounded in reality. Then you realize that what we humans accept as \\"reality\\" is a grain of sand on the beach of the universe(s).<br /><br />I finished this book in three reading sessions. No hurry; I needed to reread passages and synch them with all the NDE reading I'd done in the past.<br /><br />Let me get to the punch line: I am convinced that this is not fraudulent, not something that the author concocted to launch a new lucrative speaking career (like one MD I know only too well).<br /><br />You see, when one opens one's mind to the possibilities inherent in synchronicities rather than coincidences, one eventually comes to see that there is a purpose at the end of the rainbow sequence.<br /><br />From PROOF OF HEAVEN, I am now going on to Hemi-Sync technology for assisting in meditation. Dr. Alexander covers this on pages 158-159. I had never even heard of this system and now I am reasonably optimistic that it is the next step on my personal journey.<br /><br />I read the cynical reviews before writing mine. I can appreciate the pathogenesis, so to speak, of such views. For the most part they are either reflective of the same frustrations I have had for over half a century...or they reflect the ill-effects of dogmatic religious (vs. spiritual) viewpoints.<br /><br />If you wonder about God and the soul, and the greater realities that surround us and tease us (for want of a better way of saying it), I recommend this book without reservation. Fact is, I would like to wake up tomorrow morning in a world where 6 billion people have read this book.<br /><br />I am not so sure that the ravaged brain in this case did not trigger a massive release of DMT from the pineal gland which in turn played a facilitative role in what transpired during Dr. Alexander's coma. When some call DMT the \\"God drug\\" they appreciate that it is a facilitator, not a cause, of NDE experiences.<br /><br />At the impending conclusion of the present long count of the Mayan calendar, I do not expect a doomsday or extinction event. That is just charlatan talk to sell books. What I do expect is subtle; the enhanced release of DMT affecting humans and thereby allowing us to move incrementally to a higher plane of global consciousness. I had better be right about this, because if this does not happen I rather suspect we have doomed ourselves in this century as a result of many acts of commission and omission alike.
B009HELT3C|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch.  I will probably buy this one just to have.  If you like the other Men in Black movies you will like this one too, at least I did.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed it immensely. I did not expect it to end the way that it did. She should have been a heroin.
0547884591|5.0|Excellent. So far, its one more great book from Ferriss. Will update when I'm finished. Wish he could write a couple books per year
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|One of the best films i have seen in years! Recently viewed on amazon instant, and ended up watching 3 times over my rental period. Also, I later purchased the dvd after finding out it included the director's extended cut. Yes, Margaret is that good, just see for yourself.
B0072OFM28|5.0|The whole season excited me. I never knew what was going to happen and the final episode completely floored me. Such a great series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|One of the few alarms tjat gets me up in the mornings, solviing math is a good featue to make sure that I'm awake
B005LAIHR2|1.0|The TV show Glee meets Rock n Roll. And it ain't pretty. Take some popular songs and mangle them. That's pretty much the premise.<br />I was going to give it 2 Stars for Paul Giamatti, but then I remembered seeing Sebastian Bach and Nuno Bettancourt in one scene, and that<br />irked me, so one star.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app daily for To Do lists, music tracking and much much more.  So simple to use and absolutely love it's compatibility across so many platforms.
0395389496|3.0|These books are wonderful and my children love them.  I thought I read that a jingle bell would come with each though, and it didn't, but I may well be remembering wrong and the kids did not need the bells anyway.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Awesome! Great series... My husband is impossible to buy gifts for but loved this. Very entertaining, can't wait for series 2
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Erin Morgenstern creates and populates a magical, surreal world in Night Circus; flipping the traditional notion of a circus 180 degrees and giving us a world that is simultaneously incredible and believeable.  It reawakens a child-like enchantment with magic while immersing us in a well-told, intriguing story.
0062127241|5.0|If your into the Who then this will give you a good dose of how it all began. I am a huge Townsend fan so this book read well
0385536828|4.0|I have read or listened to on cd discs, most of McEwan's books;  I consider him to be one of the very best of authors.  Up until the last chapter of this book, my review would have been somewhat less positive, as I found the book without any sense, purpose or direction;  there seemed to be an assortment of ramblings, subplots and actions, that had no obvious bearing on much of anything.  And then the final chapter - and you realize the incredible genius of McEwan.  I do not want to spoil the book for anyone, and jumping to and reading the final chapter, will not make any sense unless you have read the entire book;  it leaves you in awe, and provides an angle that is not at all obvious!  All I can say is \\"dude!!\\"  and \\"wow\\".<br />I can't give this a 5star rating, because the book does drag and has the flaws as noted above - but stick with it!!!!
0316152196|5.0|I discovered Harry Bosch halfway through the series and really enjoy this character.  Now I am back tracking to the beginning.  This book did not disappoint and was a real page turner.
B008458O3S|5.0|I've had my Kindle Fire HD for a couple months and out of all of the free-apps-of-the-day and other apps I've downloaded, Trainyard has had the most staying power. I play it almost daily and never tire of the challenges! Like all of the best games, the rules are simple, but the complexity comes in their application within a variety of scenarios. The puzzles are challenging, but never feel impossible. As an analyst, the game feels as though the developer has taken the most attractive and fulfilling parts of problem solving and has made them into an intuitive and rewarding game! I joke that we should be on payroll for solving the trainyard's engineering challenges! After completing the regular puzzles, bonus levels are unlocked; on the whole, they are far more challenging. The game forces the user to hold multiple things in one's mind simultaneously: the color of trains (in combination or split), the timing of the trains, the route of the trains, and the number of trains. Amidst this backdrop, there are contraints in how the track is laid by the user so that the right color and number of trains reach the goal stations. There is limited space on the board, and some of the valuable real estate is taken up by obstacles. While there is no incentive to reach the solution in a given allotment of time, nor with the least amount of track, I've found that simpler is usually better. The user can run unlimited simulations to determine how one's design meets or doesn't meet the objective. The simulation speed can be modified as the user studies timing and outcomes. The user interface and design is great and the puzzles are super-fun. If you like puzzles that involve reasoning, this game is ideal!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This dvd was just as described, received it very quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.  looking forward to find another dvd.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|it's to bad it keeps freezing. this was a really good app. it was fun to. please make it stop freezing.
B001041JLE|5.0|I choose this rating because this product complains all my expectations.<br />I like it's a new product.<br />I recommend this product to Michael Jackson's fan all around the world, even people who likes the classic albums.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|It was a very fun movie. I loved the part when his heart just melted and he changed. So amazing!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but am riveted by her courage to undergo such an expedition.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the book because it is missing pages. One area I was on was page 1427 and it skips to 1435.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This group is one of the most talented new artists that I have heard in a long time. Their music is a blend of soul, R&B, and funk. Tiffany's(lead singer) voice is a cross between Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, and Ella Fitzgerald. Keep it coming Alabama Shakes!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Newsfeed doesn't work properly--can only see the last ten items and no way to scroll down to older items.  Since newsfeed is my main interaction with FB, this app is almost worthless.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|good stuff! finally got me to flex a different muscle instead of studying for finals. rejection from society is what created the X-men.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I was excited to find this as a christmas gift for a grandson who enjoyed it on the original VHS Tape as a small boy. This was lost in a move....so  now he can enjoy it on  the new DVD format
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have never sat and read a whole group of books but these were definet page turners a++++++ books oh yeah \\"May the odds be ever in your favor\\"
B007G51UV0|5.0|Very happy. Using with i7-3770k it is very fast. I do the automatic tuning and this works great for me. Works at 4484MHz when it needs the speed and at 1670 the rest of the time. I like the fan adjustment software to make everything more quiet.
B00000IMTG|5.0|this is a great album. I love Dio and I love this kind of music. Dio's music has a melody and is heavy metal sounding. I love the guiter solos.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|The best in the series so far....can't wait to see the second one.....I am only sad that it is almost over :(
B008WOULPK|5.0|Grace: A Memoir was a relaxing, fun read.  No tension, no struggles just a wonderful narrative of her life first as a model  during the hip 1960's London and Carnaby Street.  Then her story evolves into her life as a fashion editor for high fashion magazines.  She started in London and then finally ends up at the American Vogue as the second in command to Anna Wintour.  Along the way she describes events and photo shoots with lots of famous models, photographers and gives the reader a very intimate personal entry into the world of high fashion, such as  the distant photo shots on mountain tops and secluded private beaches around the world.  She herself is a very interesting woman and she has a very strong and positive working relationship with Anna Wintour at American Vogue, which you may know is not known for her warm fuzzy personality.  But, Grace can handle her without lots of drama and she does.  Anyone who is fascinated by fashion and the way it is communicated to the world will find this an absolute wonderful read.  It is well over 400 pages but I zipped through it in two settings because of it's ease with the reader.  Worth every penny I paid for it.  I would love to meet Grace sometime, I know I would like her, actually I do already.  She lives with a interesting man in NYC who was a former hairdresser, someone whose path crossed with hers as they did shoots all over the world.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|If you don't know Brandi Carlisle you are really missing a fabulous singer.  This album was her first big one and it's filled with great tracks.  If you like it, get Give Up the Ghost and Live at Benaroya Hall also.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game a lot. It is very addicting. I would recommend it to anyone. If you need something to during s flight or something this is your game.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a good game when you dont want to purchase one from the store and worry about pieces missing or all over the floor. For me it's relaxing and fun
0446580848|5.0|one of his best books yet.  when I was finished with the book, i was actually missing John Corey.  He's a GREAT character!!
B003WMX3SY|5.0|Aside from the high price tag, everything is good to go with this case. Plenty of room, well built, and even a neat little &#34;toolbox&#34; to store all your screws in. Antec has always been a leader in quality and innovation, with this case being no exception.Quick shipping and lowest price around. Oh, and one last thing if you're looking to buy this case, buy LOTS of extra fans.
0385536828|1.0|the brilliant opening sentences promise a lot, but the novel never delivers.<br /><br />even skimming, i kept falling asleep.<br /><br />an MI5 spy story with no tension...the credulous (and herself unbelievable -- a math whiz AND a literature junkie -- are you serious?) main character has little depth and gains no sympathy...<br /><br />she \\"falls in love\\" with almost every guy she's casually introduced to...each of them under-developed, undernourished, and repulsive.<br /><br />what was my first clue this novel was gonna disappoint? the book jacket -- the worst photoshop composite on the cover of a great novelist's work i've ever seen...the focal lengths don't match...the exposures don't match...careless in the extreme.<br /><br />blecccgggh! i'm going back to \\"little dorrit\\" -- and whatever jennifer egan decides to write next.<br /><br />hint: read egan's \\"black box.\\" it's what a compelling spy story should be -- and all in tweets, no less.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was the perfect gift for my husband. Played perfect. Nothing else really to say about it. Normal DVD that we wanted.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|The author takes an unusual approach to crafting the ideal body for anybody reading this book.  He works on you diet, excercise and mentality and makes you want to stay with his program to see the results.  I've been staying true to the diet, doing kettle bell swings and swimming for a month and I feel like a new human.  Highly suggest this book if you are looking for a life change.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but that would have been back before all of the star wars ads came on :P they just pop out and sometimes makes you loose your bird! meh it is very fun but this can simmer down on the ads
0920668372|5.0|I love this book. As a child, my mom read it to me. Now I read it to my step daughter. It's a wonderful story of love and patience. So beautiful.
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you like music and someone who stands for something look up Xavier Rudds spirit bird cd. You can check him out yourself. Also look up he Yeshe' he is cool too.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|It is a nice action flick that has many sentimental favorite action stars! You know they had fun making this flick.
0547884591|5.0|When I first picked up a copy of the 4 hour body in the bookstore I had only planned on leafing through it to see if it was something I possibly would be interested in reading and 2 hours later and over half of the book read I finally just bought it and finished reading it at home.  The 4 Hour Chef I knew would not be a disappointment and I was not wrong. I dove head first into the book and have finished the section on Meta Learning which sets the tone for how you will learn the skills to cook like a professional. The skill with which T.F. breaks down a subject and then recreates the explanation in a format that allows the reader to not only learn that subject in an relatable, fast, and entertaining way is great; but the fact that he then gives the reader the tools he used in the learning process so they can follow the same format, makes learning any subject seem attainable.<br /><br />The book delivers.<br /><br />From the well taken photographs and vividly color coded indexing the book is well thought out and written; the all encompassing meta learning section, the \\"velvety smooth\\" Domestic section, the Manly Wild section, the fun Science section and the Sexy Professional section are all designed to teach, but are written with a conversational quality along with the occasional fun and witty banter among friends. In addition to showing you the skills you'll need to professionally craft your own meals it makes you want to go out and create shared experiences of your own.
0375847227|5.0|Pullman does a wonderful job of emulating C.S. Lewis, and other top fantasy writers. His style is easy to read. His plot flows smoothly, but not to smooth, or else I would fall asleep. I will recommend this to all my C. S. Lewis friends who are on the verge of changing over, and to my friends who have already seen the light. Pullman is worth several re-reads.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was my first workout DVD that I purchased after my C-section. Great for beginners! I like how it advances to more challenging workouts!
1451688091|3.0|Starts out great, very well researched, but it reads as if she changed her mind about how to organize her argument.  She begins by spotlighting the rivals as we await the historic moment when Lincoln becomes the Republican candidate, giving the background of each man who is competing for that nomination.  A few chapters later, we begin slogging through the Civil War...approximately in real-time.  It forces the historian to keep repeating her points about Lincoln's character and his strategies, over and over.  So the final two-thirds of the book plods along chronologically and there's a bit of repetition of quotes n sources.
B003WJ6AD2|3.0|Arrived in estimated arrival time and was in mint condition without the slightest scratch. This version of Legends alright I think they made a bit too much cuts to the original film with this American Directors Cut.
B004QSQML8|5.0|One of my favorite movies in the &#34;full&#34; version with extended scenes and non-hollywood ending that I've never seen. Mia Sara singing!!! The one knock is the original orchestral score here is far inferior to the Tangerine Dream soundtrack added to the American release. Appears to be much brighter than my VHS version even though Ridley makes a disclaimer at the beginning about how dark it is. Have not checked out the extras yet.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|As always Linkin Park is awesome love the fresh new songs. Again arrived in estimated time of arrival and was in mint condition. Recommend to all the LInkin Park lovers out there

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Jonny Lee Miller is perfect as the fidgety, brilliant Holmes, all his senses operating at full speed ahead. He is an incredible actor who easily moves from portraying attitude to amazingly subtle vulnerability . And Lucy Liu is wonderful as his counterpart, Dr. Watson. She can more than stand up to Miller's genius. The way they deal with each other and the skeletons in their respective closets adds intrigue and a sense of their humanity. This series is terrific on so many levels. It hits all your buttons if you are a mystery buff, the acting is fine, and the substory about addiction is compelling. Don't miss it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really love this calculator app... its clear and very easy to use. I can even use it WITHOUT my glasses!!  Clear, no extra buttons, very easy to use.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There were some unbelievable parts, but for the most part is was a gripping read.<br />Had difficulty putting it down.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|While the subject was very moving; the way the author presented it was quite unquie and it kept your interest throughout
1419702238|5.0|These books have really continued to flame the love of reading for my nephew. He loves getting these books and reads them at least 3 to 4 times each.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story kept your interest until the very end of the book.  The author put quite a twist on the storyline throughout the book.

B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I love this RSS reader! I mainly use it to keep up with recipes from food blogs I read. I subscribe to all the food blogs I read and I have the reader set up to sync daily and it organizes the recipes by blog. I can search for key words like ingredients in the recipes. When I click on a recipe it opens up the reader's view then I have the option of visiting the actual website. It also has the option to let you star an entry.

B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This is a great movie. This is a must watch. And not to spoil it but seems like the ending leaves you wondering about something.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|The only issue is that I cannot download it onto any device except the kindle. I am not a kindle user so I'm screwed watching it on PlayStation.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|This a wonderful movie and i loved every minute. However there is no audio commentary. Barry Sonnenfeld gives great commentary and i was looking forward to hearing it. I hope there is commentary on the blu ray.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed the novel, but it's format (interviews with survivors) did not allow to really connect with the characters and the events they were facing!<br />Nevertheless there were quite a few memorable characters. I really liked the Japanese blind master!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Another amazing book. Five stars!!! I can't wait to start the next book. I just can't get enough of this series.

B004SEUIXS|3.0|Actually I didn't mind the subtitles but reviews were somewhat hyped up more than I felt was right. It had some fun and quirkey mini plots.
B003SJ4VJ6|5.0|This is a dark well-acted thriller - perfect setting. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys classic 'shadow government' derring do.

0060555661|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read on the subject of investing.  Benjamin Graham's book originally published, in 1930/1940, continues to be true to its tenets.  At the end of each chapter there is a well written commentary of what has changed in the investing world; for example; # and complexity of investment vehicles; the writers explain the Graham approach to todays world.<br /><br />If a library has one&#34;investor&#34; book.  That book would be &#34;The Intelligent Investor&#34;.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I am so happy with this movie. Without Matt Damon I thought the series was done but Jeremy Renner was great. I get that some people didn't love it but they had to take time to tie in the new characters and I hope they are making another one!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I picked this up on a whim. It's too bad the movie with what's his name is coming out. I picture him now as I read.<br />The story is brisk and the author keeps it moving. Nothing too complex. I enjoyed it.

1613771355|4.0|Excellent and lovely visual narrative, and the text and concept is really accurate to the original book, nothing to worry about; the edition is beautiful too and a few of the drawings at the end are worth the peek. It would be perfect if not for the drawing style, simple coloring and that stupid-puffy- looking thing in Amaltea's forehead (it really bothered me).

B005LAIIA8|4.0|I haven't seen the whole movie - just previews.  I know I will like it anyway because of the use of the theme in a new way.  As an added feature, it is the 3D that caught my eye.  I am 78 years young and enjoy<br />new technology.  To be alive in an era when a person can have this feature as an everyday availability is<br />mind bogeling.  I was alive when the previous 3D efforts were launched in the early 1950's.
B003WTE886|4.0|It looks great and will is going to make for a great gift, thanks again and have a great day
B0031ES8P6|3.0|I got this in the mail today and was a little disappointed in the color of the bow and dress the kitty had on.  In the first picture the dress looks like a hot pink/plaid.  It is not hot pink; it's bubble gum pink.  It's still cute just was expecting it to look different.  For color clarity, look at the 2nd picture of Hello Kitty under the product details.

159413586X|2.0|Unfortunately, I think this book was written quickly so the publishers could get it out the door while the market was hot. Everything was rushed and disjointed, characters that seemed to be deeply cared about and thought out in the first 2 books lacked any real emotions or personality. Not what I'd like to have seen.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love the series, I love the price and love that I had it sooner than I thought I would!
1594135851|4.0|While not as bad as book 3, this book fell slightly short of the first book in that the storyline was not as well thought out and deep. I felt like things were a little rushed.
B004OC07F8|5.0|A very important book to whom want to seek a different path of everybody, who wants to go further, deep down in the core of the concept of inovation that an enterprise has to have to make its own market, or, as the book calls, blue oceans.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I expected the book to have more details re \\"Proof of Heaven\\" rather than all the medical terminology, which was quite repetitious.  It was evident the book was written by a physician.  Overall, the book did hold my interest, especially the strong family ties Eben Alexander shared with his family.
B008S4YZCO|1.0|Downloaded through the Kindle Fire using App store - wouldn't load once installed.  Removed from device and downloaded through Amazon.com app store - loading even worse as it kept flipping back and forth between a black screen, a loading circle, and the Gameloft screen.  I almost had to hard close the Fire because I couldn't access the back arrow tab.  Now I have one very disappointed daughter.  Probably won't even attempt any other Gameloft games beyond what she already plays.
1419705849|5.0|My kid loves this series and rereads it many times; he wanted to buy this book since it came out - nice Christmas gift for somebody who loves to read.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I've seen this film twice already and plan to see it one more time on an IMAX screen. I always like to see the Bonds several times in the movies before I decide where it stands among my other favorite Bonds.  I enjoyed it much more the second time.  I thought I would comment on it when it arrived on blu-ray, but since so many have commented already I thought I might as well add my two cents in.  Skyfall is a very good Bond film.  Is it one of my ten favorites? No.  Some of the reviewers seem to have gone over the top on this film. One declared it the best Bond film since Goldfinger.  Not quite.  (It reminds me of one movie critic in New York who in a moment of pure insanity in her review of Never Say Never Again declared it to be the best Bond since From Russia With Love.  It has since been re-evaluated and we can now see now what a total mediocrity it was.  But I digress.)<br />Based on most of the critics, one would think that Daniel Craig is the best Bond of all time.  Yet I met several people after seeing Skyfall (including my wife) who don't like him at all.  Look everyone has their favorite Bond.  As one who saw Dr. No in the movies, with my father, at age 13, I still think Connery is the best.  But I could make a case that there really hasn't been a bad James Bond.  Four out of the first 5 Connery Bonds are in my top 10 (YOLT, FRWL, Thunderball and Goldfinger.)  Yet Connery made the very average Diamonds are Forever, a huge disappointment after OHMSS.  He also made the totally unnecessary mess, Never Say Never Again.  Bond number 2, George Lazenby gets a bad rap for his acting.  Yet he starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a fantastic film and one of my top 5.  Roger Moore starred in two great Bonds: The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy and 3 very enjoyable and entertaining Bonds: For Your Eyes Only, Moonraker and Live and Let Die.  Moore also starred in the mediocre A View to a Kill and the terrible Man With the Golden Gun.  Timothy Dalton, who also takes a bad rap, starred in two excellent Bonds: the solid The Living Daylights and the underrated License to Kill, another of my top ten. (Dalton gets condemned for playing Bond the exact same way that Craig receives raves for.) Pierce Brosnan started at the top with the excellent Goldeneye and worked his way down to the silly and disappointing Die Another Day.  Which brings us to Daniel Craig.  Casino Royale was a tremendous film with 2 unbelievable action scenes in the first hour that virtually had very little to do with the actual plot.  It was beautifully directed by Martin Campbell who also gave us Brosnan's successful debut Goldeneye.  Craig then starred in Quantum of Solace, a rushed and massively boring Bond with action scenes that almost put me to sleep.  Skyfall is far better than Quantum (one of my least favorite Bonds) and not as good as Casino Royale, another of my top 10.<br />The film opens with a long pre-credit sequence that one critic labeled the best ever.  I don't think so.  I much preferred the openings of The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker and Goldeneye, among others.  Without giving too much away to those who haven't seen it: the film gives us much more about James Bond's childhood and background than we have ever seen.  Unlike most of the other Bonds, most of the action takes place in Great Britain, including a terrific chase seen in the London Underground (thats the Subways to a New Yorker like myself.)  The film also features one of the best casts of any Bond with Javier Bardem, (a great villain,) Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney.  Also without giving too much away, the conclusion of the film is basically the beginning of the Bond films to come: no more deep thoughts and revenge plots, just good Bond action.  In an interview I read, Craig says that he would like to do a large scale action-packed Bond along the lines of the old Bonds, say You Only Live Twice or The Spy Who Loved Me.<br />In conclusion, as one who has seen each Bond film more timesthan I can possibly remember, Skyfall is solid entertainment.  As stated, it is not my my top ten, but probably in the top 15.  I am surprised at some of the negative reviews I've read here.  But don't worry, it just became the highest grossing British film of all time.  So two years from now, we can be assured that James Bond will be back.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Powerful outstanding and moving.<br />I loved the book and it has definitely taught me a lot about a world I will never see
B007SGM084|5.0|Wasn't sure about this book at first, so glad I bought it. Great read!  Have suggested to friends to read it.
B009POCFTG|5.0|Great movie. Maybe the best of last year along with Deadfall. William Friedkin still rocks at almost 80! Everything is good about it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am really enjoying it and am quite interested in finding out  what happened.  But it is not a thrilling page turner.
B007XHWROK|5.0|My 5 year old daughter will love opening this Xmas morning.  She just loves her JB so much...  Very happy with purchase.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|What do you think about running in great race all over the world? This book helps you to visualize that experience in the remote place of Sierra Madre. It is about passion in running. It is about who we are. Highly entertaining
B0099114WO|1.0|I'm surprised that there's as many good reviews of this movie as there are.  This was dreadful, and surprisingly so given you have such a great actress and actor in the lead roles.  Why in the world would Streep and Tommy Lee ever agree to do this drivel?  The only redeeming quality to the movie is that they are indeed really good.  The rest is for the garbage.<br /><br />The story idea seems interesting, perhaps poignant, perhaps funny?  Oops, no.  The poor unhappy wife who wants a \\"real marriage\\" again, you know, where they actually enjoy each other's company, where they really talk and have fun.  The unpleasant, equally unhappy husband doesn't want anything to change and fights her tooth and nail at her suggestion they go to marriage counselling.  Alas, he gives in and the rest of the movie is about...............SEX.  Yep, sex.  What they want, what they don't want, what they fantasize about, how to perform certain sex acts, on and on.<br /><br />Apparently, somewhere along the way, the writer/director forgot that what the wife wanted was a \\"real marriage\\" again with fun, talking, enjoyment and friendship.  Truly, this is insulting to your intelligence and sense of decency.  This movie is so 2012, it's pathetic.  When in doubt of how to make a good movie, make it all about sex.<br /><br />Perhaps this would appeal to teenagers, except I wouldn't let my teenager see it for it's non-stop references to sex.  And the overarching message that a marriage is all about sex.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Great action scenes, nice fight scenes, a few eye rolling scenes, but overall a good action flick. Not a good Bourne movie IMO. Worth a watch.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was a very cute movie. I My girls and  both enjoyed it.. Although it would be nice if Tinker was  celebrated  once in awhile for following the  rules instead of always breaking the them. At least she does suffer some minor consequences. Overall this is a good, clean, and appropriate movie as well as entertaining and I would very much recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I haven't read Grisham in a long time so I thought I would try this book.  The premise is cool but I feel like this book lacked the excitement and suspense of some Grisham's earlier books.  Not meaty enough.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|...the hype, that is. Why is everyone so obsessed with this movie? It is by far the weakest installment of the entire \\"Dark Knight\\" trilogy. I don't want to give too much away, but here is what bugged me the most. First of all, I've watched \\"The Dark Knight\\" about 20 times. Am I missing something crucial here? Because I do not remember Batman getting so messed up at the end of that movie that he is left a decrepit cripple. Secondly, Bane was the worst villain we've seen in these films. Yeah, he's a big bad guy. I get that. But he looks like Brian Urlacher in a Hannibal Lecter mask with a pair of man boobs. That's more laughable than intimidating. Also, I have complained about Christian Bale's muffled Batman voice throughout this entire series, which gets harder to understand with every film. However, Bane's mumbles make Batman sound like the Enunciation King. Bane sounds like he has marbles in his mouth the entire time. I am not a comic book reader, but I am also confused about how a certain person could have his back broken in a movie, and then be up chasing people around again in just a couple of scenes. Hmm.<br /><br />There were a couple of good things about the film. I adore Marion Cotillard in everything she does and thought her performance was amazing in this film. I enjoyed the twist with her character at the end, which I did not anticipate. I also liked this new interpretation of the Catwoman character. Anne Hathaway is usually a very overrated actress, in my opinion, but I thought she delivered a solid performance this time around (although I still wish someone else had been cast in that role, because AH just really bugs me). Still, the twist at the end involving what becomes of Selina Kyle was a disappointment. It was unexpected and unbelievable, in my opinion. What a lame way to end a trilogy that had been so exciting up to this point.<br /><br />I waited a long time to see this movie, and I really expected it to be better than it was. That was almost three hours of my life (oh yeah, this movie drags and drags and DRAGS) that I will never get back.ree hours of my life (oh yeah, this movie drags and drags and DRAGS) that I will never get back.
B004HX4RT6|2.0|this game takes too long for computers to move and I have once waited. one hour for the computer to move this game doesn't have high enough levels for me but it is a good game with good graphics.
B00002E233|2.0|Pretty retarded. Purely class B, full of cheap thrills and no storyline, plot or character development. I'd get rid of it if I had the opportunity.
B006ZCWTZG|2.0|On paper these songs appear trite and corny but most of the time Springsteen manages to pull them off with his typical broad brush strokes.<br /><br />However, like many modern recordings this vinyl version sounds awful.<br /><br />It's loud and coarse without nuance or clarity.<br /><br />Sonic sludge that makes your stereo sound like it's broken.<br /><br />Avoid.
B008DVW7DQ|5.0|Many fans of artists have been longing for to own a video footage made professionally from favorite artist's concert appearance, yet, there was never been a single video on the market which delights fans, become an instant treasure and a happy reminder of the moments at the concerts one was able to attend.  This video is all that and more.  Its entire footage are dedicated to bring the excitement, incomparable beauty, intimacy and warmth of concerts Mr. Jaroussky never fails to deliver and not only that the selection of the arias and the concerts are so well done. It clearly shows Mr. Jaroussky's artistic growth from 2006 to current year during which Mr. Jaroussky developed as an extraordinary artist and a star countertenor.<br /><br />His focus from the early stage of his career are to devote whenever possible to bring more interests in countertenor's voice, neglected composers' work and to direct limelight on fellow countertenors.  His legendary kindness, selfless dedication to his art and sincerity as a person are the natural driving forces in materializing all his wishes.  We have not enjoyed such an abundance of great countertenors and many baroque opera productions as today without his effort of many years.<br /><br />This DVD captured all that went behind this gentle but strong-willed Apollo of<br />countertenors and most certainly will become a cherished treasure for not only his fans but also for music fans who love the ambiance of great live concerts.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|A very entertaining story.  This is my first book from this author and he's now on my must read list.<br /><br />As for Pines...good mix of Twilight Zone/Stephen King/Silent Hill (minus the extreme horror).  The first half of the book is the strongest, but the 2nd half is good as well.  It kept me quessing and I wasn't quite able to figure it out until close to the very end.  Characters are done well and the writing style of the overall book is appealing.  Don't you hate it when you get into a book and just can't get past the style or structure?  Not the case here.  I finished Pines in two days, which is quicker than my usual reading pace.  I highly recommend a purchase/kindle borrow.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Starting on another Blake Crouch book now...Run.
B009JBZH54|1.0|really? i have 2 copies of the dark knight rises special features disc and dont have the actual movie. how could a major company allow this kind of terrible production quality?<br /><br />amazon is replacing, but very disappointed after waiting 2 months for this since the pre-order.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid series are funny and entertaining. And that make me laugh. That is why I like it. I would read it to my sister if I can and try to make her be entertained
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is a good product, but didn't solve the original problem which has since been resolved.  I like the Kindle and the cable.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got the DVD's on the 12.06.2012!  Talk about wonderful service!  I am too pleased for words!  Between all of my other DVD's and my family, I am going to have a wonderful Christmas!  Thank you! 6 stars!
B002WGZ1L8|1.0|I ordered this beautiful book, and received  a blue hard cover from Reader's Digest. Definitely not 1st edition, 7th printing
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fast paced action throughout.  liked the short chapters, making it a little less difficult to put the book down when dinner is ready.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great end to series! I highly recommend to both young adults and older one  alike. Violence is not as bad as the movies portray.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great story, great acting, great cinematography--everything but the violence and profanity!<br /><br />If you like the best actors of BBC, you'll love this movie.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book like it predecessor received widely mixed reviews. There isn't the kind of grand conclusions to story lines that take place in the previous books, which is disappointing to many readers. This book, like &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34; occurs during a brief lull in the action, and is generally setting things up for (we all hope) a following series of books where all hell will break loose.<br /><br />If you were disappointed by all of the B-List characters in the previous book (e.g. no Jon, Bran, etc.) then you will be pleased to see that their stories all continue in this book.<br /><br />I found the book enjoyable and it makes me very eager to see what happens next. Unfortunately, I am afraid that the next book won't be appearing for some time....
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Got instant accees to it online on Amazon videos. Streamed it 1080p for my kids the day after I purchased it. Still waiting for the disc but Amazon should just include a digital copy liie this with any premium bluray they sell. 5 stars. Movie is hilarious btw. Thanks so much.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I find this jig-saw puzzle app to be a highly relaxing and enjoyable way to spend my break time and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't like to play strenulously challenging games. It's more for relaxing.
B0063IH60K|3.0|game is fun, but the ads before every game are really annoying.  other wise, the game is a great time waster.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I bought this for my hubby's birthday its really good movie to watch brand new ... its a must watch so if you haven't seen it get it...
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I must say, I watched it on HD PPV 3 times and with the Extreme Loud Music and the Mask On Banes Head,Face & Mouth; I Honestly  couldnt make out half of what He was talking about. I have a copy for my Son ordered from amazon, Maybe he can get me straightened out.  Its somewhat-or at least to me- A little hard to understand at times.  I believe this is because of not being  able to understand half; of what is being said.  It was to me and this is only JMHO- not as good a move as The Dark Knight. I will tell you this though, \\"That Bane Chacater is very much on The dark Side, & Gave me the 'Creeps'. Werid-o.  I throughly loved 'The Cat Woman in it. 'Seline Kiley\\".  If you dont have Vertigo, after the First 5 minutes of the movie. You will have it.  That scene with The Aircraft breaking up, was something else.<br />  I believe this was the end of 'Batman', but I believed it opened the door for \\" Enter-Robin \\". To Me it would have rated 4 stars, but the Sound Projection, just dragged it down to a 3 star to me.  Again JMHO. I put my earphones on and still hard a problem with some of The dialouge; attributed to Banes mask & that Head Splitting Music.  I hate to keep wakeing a sleeping dog, but try it yourself and see what you think.  I do however reccomend it. Lots & Lots of Action.
1419705849|4.0|I bought this for my step son for Christmas. So obviously he hasn't received it yet. I'm sure he will like it though. He liked all the other ones.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I have downloaded this app twice and it always kicks me off on the second screen. The graphics looked good, but I was disappointed that I never even got into the game. I tried to contact the producers of the app to fix the glitch, but no one ever got back to me.
1568363931|5.0|I wanted to try healthier lunches for my kids for school this year. These are a little more than I typically do every day, but they are nice for once in a while - like special days (birthdays, etc.). The recipes are easy to follow and require basically easy to find ingredients. Everything we've tried so far is delicious! Some we've turned into full family meals at the table. I am so glad I found this book!
B008XG1X18|4.0|For anyone who uses pinterest, this app is great on the kindle! The graphics are very clear. I have had a little trouble pinning to the board of my choice, but I just move the pins to their proper board later. I recommend this app.

B00000272N|5.0|I will be one hundred percent honest with you. I've always really liked Alice in Chains, but had not really listened to them outside their hits and the album \\"Dirt\\", which I own. I had started listening to tracks off this album last night, deciding if I wanted to purchase it or not. I started with \\"Confusion\\", and fell in love. I bought the album today, and have listened to it twice through already. Staley's vocals are amazing as ever here, as is Cantrell's guitar work. The riffs go from fast and catchy to melodic, slow and sludgy. It's a great album to put on and rock out to. Don't get me wrong, I love \\"Dirt\\"..but I always feel depressed coming off of that album. How could you not? Other tracks that stand out to me as instant favorites are \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Sea of Sorrow\\", \\"Bleed the Freak\\", \\"I Can't Remember\\", and \\"Put You Down\\". But these are just favorites, literally every song on this album rocks hard, and is great to listen to. And of course, who can forget the mega hit that this album spawned, \\"Man in the Box\\". This album is already one of my favorites, right along Stone Temple Pilot's \\"Core\\" and Paw's \\"Dragline\\". Simply put, if you like hard rock or grunge (though it's not really a grunge album, but chances are if you dig grunge you'll dig this as well since AiC is grouped into the genre), pick up this album ASAP. I purchased it digitally, and I will be picking up a hard copy this weekend as well. I wish Amazon would let me rate this album six stars. Enjoy, and keep rockin! \m/(>.&lt;)\m/

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love my Kindle, and this book was a great read on it. A fair price considering the popularity of the book.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Works as advertised - holds my small flashlight securly, easy to access, clip holds well on belt. HIghly recommend this product.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|if you try to understand the great mind behind the success of Apple, Pixar...<br />And see the whole picture - the good, great and the not so good. The question for me remains - do you have to be leader as Steve was, to create something so extraordinary? or you can be a better person and still create amazing things?
B004I2K4E8|3.0|Overall, the concert was good.  Alfie Boe didn't disappoint, as well as most of the artists.  One thing I just can't fathom is the inclusion of Nick Jonas, who really stood out -- as the least talented!  It's nice that they included a number by several Jean Valjeans!<br />Blu-ray quality is good as expected.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|Dan Ariely's book are always worth what they promise. and in today's day is the topic of dishonesty probably more relevant than ever. unfortunately. Ariely goes underneath and helps you to understand what drives us and why we use little or bigger lies.
B00110K62U|5.0|I may be a bit biased coz LeMis is my favorite musical.  But the actors selected for this concert are just awesome.  Sound quality on this DVD is great!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|All 3 books kept my attention!  Totally loved the book and was eager to see what else the wroter had wrote, only to find out that he passed away before this book was even published.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is a recent purchase. I've viewed two episodes so far.<br /><br />PROS...The picture and sound quality are way beyond what I expected. Everything is crystal clear. No commercials either. There are no double-sided discs. Every disc is nicely secured in its case. Nothing falls out or flops around when I open the case.<br /><br />MINOR CONS...I would have preferred more detailed information about each episode, such as which main actor starred that week. Some write-ups mention it, but others don't. I have to remove some discs first to read the synopsis covered by that disc. I was hoping to be able to locate and watch my favorite episodes first, but the synopsis really doesn't help me to remember which is which. A detailed pamphlet would have been appreciated. I've solved part of the problem by turning the paper jackets inside out, putting the synopsis facing the outside of the cases.<br /><br />All-in-all I'm very pleased with this purchased. All Columbo fans will be thrilled to receive this set as a gift or to buy it for themselves. At $79.49 the price can't be beat.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I enjoyed the this second book of the series more than the first. It's good reading for anyone. I would recomend this book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Always enjoy his books and this one was no different.  Looking forward to the next book coming out.  Will buy it also.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love each character and recommend this show! It's intense at times but so worth it! You won't be sorry!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferris is always fun to read.  Even if you are a pretty avid home cook it is worth picking up this book as there are some fun tips and tricks you can pick up, an interesting look into the professional cooking world, and Ferris' unique take on learning anything.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is a little small but I love it. It is almost as good as playing on the computer. Definately a keeper.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This is a well written book that really shines a light on why we do some of the crazy things we do. I actually personally recommened this book to a friend. The knowledge is invaluable.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|....like I did my Rubber Soul album when I was a teenager.<br /><br />I love this music. Lyrics are wise and touching and Ben Howard's voice is wonderful. If you like Glen Hansard (Swell Season) and similar music, you will probably enjoy this.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A well written, 5-star quality, male perspective, fantasy read. I hope the sequel will live up to the promise of this first volume of the series, \\"Raven Shadow\\".
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I can't believe I wasted money on this movie.  Everyone was talking about how great it was.  I didn't like it at all.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Action packed, great story line, well made. I don't like to buy many movies but this is one I will buy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|it was difficult to get into this book at first, the way it jumps back and forth btwn characters isnt bad its just annoying on how those characters talk, esp amy!!!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|No frills convertor that does what it says claims to, convert Firewire to Thunderbolt connections.  Essential to adapt old technology to new.
B00ABA1OP4|4.0|Now that the collection has actually been released to the states, and I've watched most of it (still working on the making of videos)...<br /><br />I have the Blu-ray version.  Not sure what if any differences there are quality wise for the DVD version vs the Blu-ray.<br /><br />TL:DR Version<br />Video's are great, but mostly SD, only the last 3 are HD.<br />Sound is great, but only 2.1 stereo (sub-woofer will rock your house if you got a good powered one).<br />Making of's are a lot of fun.<br />Quality of product is great.  If only the videos had been remastered this would have been a 6 out of 5 star product.<br /><br />DETAILS:<br /><br />The Menu:<br />Great ambiance.  Screen looks crisp and clean.  Style is very dark (visually and audibly).  I am enjoying the low tones playing right now and I could sleep very happily to this for hours.  Menus are effective and responsive.<br /><br />The Videos:<br />As many have mentioned, the videos resolution is NOT blu-ray quality.  I'll admit I feel like they could have pumped a bit of $$ into remastering the videos, but in the end for what I wanted this isn't that bad.  Mein Land and both Mein Hertz Brennt videos are clearly higher resolutions, and by the time I got to them (last three videos) I had almost forgotten how non-HD the videos were.  Sadly this ended up being a reminder of what the whole collection COULD have looked like, assuming the original source materials were available.  IMHO this cost the collection 1 star because it's not the quality I expected from such an epic band, but it's also not a deal breaker for me, nor does it stop me from greatly enjoying the discs.<br /><br />The Censorship:<br />P*ssy was a very well censored video.  Sure I've seen the full on pornographic version and would have preferred it, but I was highly pleased to NOT see the massive red \\"heat sensor\\"-censored version.  An EXCELLENT compromise.<br />Considering the amount of boobs and sexual innuendo present, I'm not sure why some things got edited (such as the bikini-clad chicks in \\"Keine Lust\\" with flame throwers that apparently got edited out, but were still in the \\"Making of\\" video)<br />Seems the main things edited out were below-the-belt genitals.<br /><br />The Audio:<br />Whine whine whine!  Oh noes, it's \\"stereo\\" instead of 5.1 surround.  Whoopitydoo!  The sound quality on every video was amazing.  I put my receiver to \\"straight\\" meaning it doesn't apply any filters or equalizers so you get whatever sound the disc provides the player with.  This cut my rear (satellite) speakers and my center.  Truth be told: I didn't notice this at first, as the sound quality was crisp and clean, and my subwoofer was tearing up my walls and shaking my couch.  I finally noticed that Till's voice was coming mostly from the right of the screen (because I was sitting closer to that speaker) at which point I looked and saw that my receiver was only getting a signal for L/R/Sub channels.  I kicked it over to \\"5-chanel Stereo\\" which tends to make stereo feel fuller and act as if it were 5.1, but it didn't sound BETTER to me, so I switched it back.<br />Honestly, the music isn't recorded for surround sound, and I fail to see how you'd gain that much from it.  Why stop at 5.1?  Why not 7.1? 7.2? Hell, what about 9.2?  The quality is great, and made me feel like I was at one of their concerts.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Great buy, though the only reason I can think of to buy the Blu-ray over the DVD is that you get the videos on 2 discs instead of 1.<br />Cover is great, pack is slick.  It's far from \\"perfect\\" video wise, but I'm very pleased with the product.  I'd love to watch the DVD version to see if the claim that \\"upscaled DVD looks better than Blu-ray\\" is at all accurate, but I'm not about to buy a DVD copy to find out. (unless maybe I opt to buy a copy for a friend)<br /><br />Making Of:<br />Only watched a few, and so far they are pretty great.  Love these guys.  Only disappointment so far was Mann Gegen Mann.  I had never seen that video before and by God it was quite homo-erotic.  Lots of near-naked men in a sea of man-flesh oiled and rubbing on each other gropingly.  Didn't bother me much, but since I had always heard the translation was \\"Man Vs. Man\\" (apparently it's \\"Man against Man\\" as in physically pressed against each other) I was caught off guard and hoped that the Making of video would enlighten me.  It was just the director saying he knew just what he wanted to do for the video, and how honored he was to make a Rammstein video, and how amazing the band is, and how amazing all their videos are.  Not once did any band member comment on the video.  Didn't even explain why he did what he did with the video.<br />Rest have been great so far.

1423113454|4.0|I am extremely excited to have finished the first book in the Kane Chronicles. I'm a big fan of Rick Riordan and so I love any chance  I get at reading one of his awesome stories.<br /><br />The Red Pyramid is the first in his series of books about ancient Egypt. Brother and sister Carter and Sadie have split apart now that their mother is dead. Sadie lives a normal life in London with their grandparents while Carter travels the world with only a suitcase to his name with his father, who happens to be one of the foremost experts on Egyptian myth. On a night where their father promises to set everything right for their family, Carter and Sadie find that Egyptian myth did not die in the pyramids... the world around them is not all that it may seem and they must risk everything to help save their father when the Egyptian god Set is released.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Riordan's original Percy Jackson series and I've enjoyed what I've read so far of his second Percy series. It's amazing how Riordan has the ability to take what interests kids (and me) the most and turn it into a story that can't be put down. I've had people at work trade my Percy books around and love them as much as I do.<br /><br />To my enjoyment (and relief) I loved this new series. The brother and sister dynamic in this book really brought on some interesting situations and some pretty funny dialog. I would find myself chuckling along to Carter and Sadie's constant bickering. These two main characters as well as the Gods and Goddesses we meet have such rich and vibrant personalities you can't help but fall into the world that Riordan has created. He has such a way with world building and you can just picture the characters traveling across the U.S. and into the world of Egyptian lore. I was dazzled once again.<br /><br />One thing that really makes Riordan's books so enjoyable is that he takes our characters to real places and teaches you along the way. As an adult I get excited when I go places where Percy Jackson has been so I can only assume that kids get just as excited as I do! It's a great learning tool and makes you thirst for more and more knowledge on the subject Riordan has presented.<br /><br />The story moved at a great pace that made you never want to put the book down and the exciting adventure through out the story had me reaching for book two! If you haven't read one of Rick Riordan's books yet, I suggest you do so stat!<br /><br />9 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)where Percy Jackson has been so I can only assume that kids get just as excited as I do!

B000MD9UJC|5.0|I have a bunch of Mini Maglites...in my cars, in my house, at work, etc. I like the new LED flashlights because they do not eat up batteries like the incandescent flashlights, plus they have a whiter light.  Instead of throwing away all my old mag lites I decided to convert them to LED with this kit.<br />Wow...What a difference!  The light is much brighter, and the light pattern is smooth.  PLUS the push button on the tail cap works great.  It's much more convenient than rotating the head of the flashlight.  A new quality flashlight with the same light output could easily cost over $20...this kit was under $10.  Great value and great performance.  They also make a 1watt kit if you want an even brighter light, but then you would sacrifice battery life.
B0012F90NK|5.0|\\"Art Rock\\" was always an uncomfortable medium to push, because it was so easy for some groups to occasionally fall into a trap of \\"rockifying\\" classical music, which sometimes produced technically virtuoso curiosity pieces (ELP), simply playing rock with the accoutrements of classical instrumentation (ELO), using classical instruments to evoke a Renaissance-like hybrid (Jethro Tull, Gryphon) or by constructing rock pieces within tried and true formats (The Who's \\"Tommy\\")-not that I'm necessarily criticizing these groups output (had to say that, especially after mentioning Gryphon and The Who). However with \\"Relayer\\" and in particular the \\"Gates of Delirium,\\" Yes managed to produce something new: A rock composition that seemed to be inspired by classical long-form pieces, but with no hint of trying to imitate something.  They had obviously given many glimpses of this in earlier albums, which used classical feel of the mellotron and the warmth of folk music, but \\"Gates\\" never really felt like it was trying to emulate other music: it was a true rock concerto, and I don't think a new listener hearing the word \\"rock\\" or \\"concerto\\" could really imagine what they were about to hear.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I like this pinterest app a lot. One thing I noticed though, which I dont understand, is the category section where it allows you to select a category, some of the boxes on the right are half cut off, like the page doesn't fit the screen. I have a 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, so maybe that has something to do with it. Nothing big, but kinda annoying. Very handy app if you're a pinterest junkie.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|.I love this movie, this combo pack is great. I recommended 100%. . . . . . . . .

0062215507|5.0|My 9 year old is super into Harry Potter and this is such a fun book for him ... it has all kinds of cool extras like a copy of the Maruader's Map that really make it special.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book story line takes an interesting direction at the end can't wait to read the next one in the series
B0031RAOVY|2.0|This movie starts out sad and only gets worse. Death of people, death of dogs, homelessness, neglect... you got it! If you enjoy choking heart ache and sobbing and movies that will ruin you for at least a week, Hachi is for you. Don't be fooled by the healthy pet and smiling actors on the cover. All will have masks of misery on about fifteen minutes in until this movie mercifully ends at last. It's the Terms of Endearment for dog movies, only without the humor and with a happy ending. Oh, that's right, there wasn't one.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I love this book, so funny!  It's good to read a book like this before bedtime.  And it's a good book to pass time too!  Looking forward to more of David Sedaris's book!

B000FA5TTW|5.0|The time the novel is set in (70s) and how Susie Salmon leaves her life (raped and murdered by a neighbor in a cornfield adjoining a housing development) shows how much transition was occuring ... that a missing teenage girl could slip so easily from realm to another back before cell phones and video cameras. Susie's Heaven is a microcosm of the mind of a young woman on the verge of becoming a sexual being before being murdered... peppermint ice cream and dogs, an adult caregiver to help to come to grips with dying, and a friend of the same age to explore with. The book shows how a death in a small community causes ripples, changes directions of peoples' lives... in good and bad ways. Reading how Susie's brother and sister change... and how a woman who never wanted to be a mother runs as fast and far as she can, only to find herself haunted... a father who finds he can't save his family or himself, and a Jackie O grandmother who attempts to hold the remnants of her daughter's family while downing highballs ... all wonderful and lovable even when they are at their ugliest. This is a book for anyone going through the grieving process. My favorite moment is when Holiday recognizes Susie in Heaven. I love this book...especially the ending. And Ruth.

B009D5VPTI|4.0|This is the first movie that we took my second daughter to see on her B-day so once we saw this on the PS3 for Amazon, we had to get it.  The only reason I gave this a three is because I don't think that it is as good of quality as it could be.  I think 720p instead of 1080.

B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Gold, I tell you. I find myself constantly re-watching seasons 1 - 3. I definitely recommend the show. Worth buying the season and having it at your disposable so you can rewatch whenever you want.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|What can I say? This is a great Blue Ray DVD of season four, Sons of Anarchy. This is, in my and my wife's opinion, the best show on TV today.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is a review mostly for others, like me, who are already big Brandon Sanderson fans.<br /><br />&#34;The Emperor's Soul&#34; is a tightly crafted story that is difficult to put down. For those familiar with Sanderson's other books, it should come as no surprise that it features a highly likable protagonist and an inventive magic system. As always for Sanderson, the implications of the magic in society are addressed, making the supernatural seem right at home in the world.<br /><br />When I read Sanderson's novella &#34;Legion,&#34; my biggest complaint is that the story felt a bit rushed and unresolved -- an excerpt from a larger story. While the events of &#34;The Emperor's Soul&#34; certainly feel like they are taken from a much larger world, the story itself is focused and there is definitely a sense of resolution.<br /><br />As much as I eagerly await new novels from Sanderson, more short fiction of this quality could certainly make the wait more palatable.
B0017P520U|5.0|This animation isn't for everyone, many would expect it to be better than it should be considering how old the story is, but I thought it told a story that practically answered the questions that comes up in the movie.

Bridge building programs and activities are definitely an enjoyable part of the career, and 'Bridge Constructor' is one of the better bridge-building apps I've run across. Some of the levels combine a very strict budget with a challenging terrain design, which makes the difficulty curve inconsistent but fun. Definitely worth the money and time to put into it. Would buy again.

B008B68J2G|5.0|The Cafe playset set could not be more perfect to accompany the new Scaris Monster High dolls.  The set consists of four main pieces, all brightly colored and made to look like art nouveau wrought iron.  The single magenta chair has a great seat detail that looks like a skull, there is a turquoise double seat, a purple table with an umbrella cover that has tiny skull \\"lights\\", and a pink and black espresso cart.  The cart holds an espresso maker and pastry display stand, and comes with several snack and beverage accessories.<br /><br />For Play:<br />I think the set gets a big gold star for just being fun and cool.<br /><br />There was minimal assembly with this playset - a bat that fits onto the top of the cart, the umbrella snaps onto the table, the double seat easily snaps together and the skull lights hang from the umbrella.  I did check to see how the dolls fit into the chairs, and they sit nicely with legs extended out in front of them, but do not sit flat with knees bent and feet under the seats.<br /><br />There are several small accessories - a cappuccino cup, water bottle, flower vase and treats that will probably be misplaced by younger children.  The other small parts are the (8) skull lights on the umbrella, but they stay in place quite well and did not fall off/out when I turned the table upside down.<br /><br />One potential weak area on the set are the wheels on the cart, which could come off if handled roughly.<br /><br />For Collectors:<br />My favorite thing about the Scaris Cafe playset is that the seating is the perfect way to display my Scaris basic dolls (Ghoulia, Draculaura, Abbey) as the basic dolls do not come with doll stands.  Please note: you will have to work on your poses to get them to sit without their underwear showing - they are all wearing mini dresses.  There is so much detail on all of the pieces, tiny skulls and cobwebs everywhere.  This set is so unique and well themed - a great addition to a Monster High collection.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it kept  me on the edge of my seat. The action seemed to flow moment to moment.  It held my interest  as it moved from one scene to the next.
B0045XICB2|3.0|I have seen the first 3 episodes and was curious about the this one and the one in theaters. My confusion of about the show started with the first, I guess this does not translate to all ages.
0374214913|2.0|2/5 stars for this one.  If I could, I would give it 2.5 stars.  Its that mediocre.    The best way to describe it is as some sort of cross between a Dan Brown novel and a techno thriller with a snarky narrator and a D&D analog named \\"Rockets and Warlocks\\" tossed in for flavor.  As interesting as this may sound, my reaction to it was a more or less resounding \\"meh\\".    This book is about a down and out web designer named Clay who's last chance at putting supper on the table is a job at an odd book store that he just happens to pass by.  Of course the book store turns out to be more than what it seems.  Its actually a front for a secret society of what amounts to code breakers, and Clay brings all his technology whiz buddies to bear in cracking the centuries old code that consumes the lives of the code breakers.    I really wanted to like this book, and one interesting thing about it was the way it brought together elements of an old fashioned, mystical, secret society with the technology of google, and the internet age in general. And the plot pacing was pretty good, good enough to keep me reading through the end anyway.  However . . .    In the beginning the prose alternated from being readable to being really clunky.  Most of this was smoothed out by the beginning of the second though. I wasn't kidding when I said the book was sort of like a Dan Brown novel.  I'm not going to give the end away, but if you have read either Angels and Demons or The DaVinci Code its not hard to guess the gist of the ending of Mr. Penumbra.  I guess there is more I could say about the characters, and especially what seemed to me to be the contrived (and painful) use of a fictional fantasy series as a necessary piece of the plot, but I think I'm going to stop there.    In summary, it wasn't a great read, but if there is a dearth of reading material this will keep you entertained for a while.    More reviews at [...]
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've used plenty of Logitech devices for my various PC's, including a very old Bluetooth keyboard and mouse set that still works perfectly after almost ten years of use and abuse.  Although many may be turned off by the high price, it is worth every penny.  I am convinced that Logitech is dedicated to making the highest quality PC peripherals and accessories on the market.<br /><br />The packaging is the first sign that you know you bought a well built product that will stand up to the test of time.  I was amazed at the thought that went into every detail including the \\"un-boxing\\" and fit and finish.  The 7.1, when set up correctly, works well and the programmable \\"G\\" buttons allow for control on most windows media programs.  The sound insulation around the speaker cups works well to minimize outside noises and the microphone has noise cancellation to avoid feedback and white noise.  The wireless is 24 GHz via USB and works very well.  It is rated for up to 40 feet and has the usual disclaimer about interference through walls and infrastructure, but I can say that leaving the PC and walking over the 40 foot limit to the kitchen to make a drink, I still had full use of the headset for sound and mic.  If you conceal your PC in a desk or cabinet, the charging wire for the headset doubles as a base to plug in the USB transmitter in an open area for the best possible reception.<br /><br />Most of what the other 5-star reviews have stated turned out to be the truth.  If the price is still too high, you can go with the lesser logitech headsets and be just as happy.<br /><br />I use this for gaming and if you are hardcore into online gaming (think L4D, or Black Opps and the like) you will enjoy this headset.
1469984202|4.0|For me the Wool stories (books?) get a solid 4/5 stars.  I would give it 4.5, but I also post these reviews over at goodreads, and they don't let you give half-stars.    I read the omnibus version, picked it up for a cool $1.99, although having read it now, I would willingly pay the $5.99 that it is usually sold for.  Anyway, the Wool series so far is made up of five smaller stories of varying lengths from short story to novella in length. Put them all together and it makes something roughly the size of a novel.    The wool stories all take place in a post apocalyptic world, where the surface of the Earth is toxic, and the remains of humanity is stuck underground in a massive silo in order to survive.  However, as you can imagine, life stuck inside a silo is not particularly suited to human flourishing.  The \\"powers that be\\" are not who everyone thinks they are and most of the social constructs (eg, being sent to clean the silo sensors, high costs for electronic communication) have been designed by the silo progenitors with manipulation and crowd control in mind.  Broadly, the 5 stories that make up Wool follow events in the silo  that are set in motion when a mysterious computer program is discovered, revealing that all in the silo is not as it seems.    The short of it is that I loved this book! The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was some pacing problems that sensed in the last story.  The last book turned out to be a lot of exposition an explanation which, while it fulfilled my desire to know more about the world of Wool, it dragged the plot pace, distanced me from the story a bit, and I think detracted from the emotional payoff of the climax/resolution of the pentology (pentad, pent something else?).    Two things I love in a science fiction yarn are a creative world, which includes both elegance of description and plausibility, as well a sense of mystery or maybe a better way to phrase it is  \\"secrets yet to be revealed\\".  I've seen this done verywell before, and Wool is no different.  Howey gets both just right.  Its like Howey makes his characters fight for every piece of his world that he shows them and by extension the reader.  Not in the sense that Gene Wolf does (where the narrators are always suspicious, and 90% of the plot can only be figured out by extrapolating on small textual clues), but in the sense that Howey's characters go through a lot of grief to earn every piece of information that the reader gets.  While I can imagine a scenario where this kind of tension filled plotting can be frustrating to a reader if taken too far, Howey did it just right and I felt a visceral satisfaction whenever a particularly large part of the puzzle fell into place.    The characters themselves were ok.  I liked a lot of the side characters (Knox, Solo, Walker) and the main characters from the first two stories (Holston, Marnes and Jahns), I kind of felt that Juliette and Lukas, who are the protagonists in the last three stories, were a little bit cookie cutter.  I also felt that Lukas was a little bit whiny and sometimes irritating and not necessarily well suited for Juliette or as the primary love interest in the latter portion of the book.  Anyway, the important pieces were there so I did indeed engage with even Lukas and Juliette, and since for me, this book was more about exploring the post-apocalyptic setting than identifying strongly with the characters, I didn't think it detracted from the experience very much.    In summary, if you like a post-apocalyptic mystery, you can't go wrong with Wool.  Its action-packed and sinister mysteries abound!    More reviews at [...]

I'm a photographer and like to do my own alterations in photoshop but just playing around with this on my kindle while feeding my baby or whatever is fun. there's loads of effects, masks, frames and alterations u can do, and you can adjust and combine the effects however u want. super fun app!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved the book!! Think it was well written, couldn't put it down!!<br />Glad it ended the way it hoped it would.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I spent time in Scotland this summer, which made me want to read novels with Scotland as a setting. The Voyager(Outlander) fit that need.  This book and the series that follows was recommended to me by one of my tennis partners.  In the process I have learned that others in my group have read the series and loved it as well.<br />I will be reading the rest of the Outlander series.

B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I like Susan. Great voice. I somehow felt this album feel a little short or her ability. All songs were sung well, just not stellar which is what she is capable of.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love it! This has been one of the great trilogies and I highly recommend this box set. It comes with the three movies (of course) and also comes with all the special features from all three movies (if your into that sort of thing) but all in all, this is a wonderful gift for fans of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy!

B00A7CF1QY|2.0|The Bourne Legacy was not as good as the previous Bourne Movies. The beginning of the movie was uninteresting and took to long for any action. Wait until the movie is played on HBO, Showtime, Encore, or Max and you will most likely enjoy it more.
B008DVW7DQ|5.0|I really liked this overal presentation. I encourage you to listen to this collection of Master Peaces. Selections from the best Baroque Operas and Composers that we know of. Each aria is very well executed and sounded really good. I love the subtitle option. You can actually sing along in many different languages and understand what they are saying. I got distracted by it's humor though.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Bought this to watch with a ton (couple thousand) on-line friends. Absolute blast, just not for everyone. Mild plot, but the dancing totally made up for any lack in the plot.
086571701X|5.0|I ordered this book based on the amount of positive reviews it had already received.  It appears as though it's now my turn to share how pleased I am.  I am very grateful to the author for having invested her time in writing such a wonderful book.<br /><br />I think anyone interested in fresher food, eating fresh veggies when they &#34;should be&#34; out of season, and would enjoy raising fish (either to eat or just to raise) should read this book!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love Spider,been playing for years. Great on my new Kindle Fire 4gte. Would play it on computer if I didn't have my Kindle. Very addicting!! Get it!!
B007SGM084|5.0|The whole package is just marvelous.. this book is everything & more.  I hope there's other to come.... can we get a Christian Grey book with just his thoughts. That would be great
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as the first book but still engaging. A little predictable to me. But the author makes up with her very descriptive, vivid writing. Worth reading.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|Engaging, informative, made me want more. I'd recommend to people struggling with marriage and relationship.Didn't read Eat Pray Love, but saw the movie. Committed rounded out the story for me.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Eh. Never thought I'd get through this final book. I was tempted at times to just skip to the end. I didnt feel a sense of the story closing seamlessly. Some loose ends. Such a lackluster ending, in my opinion.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Barbra at her best.  An extremely moving story.  Makes you count your blessings and greatful for gowing up in the era that we are.  We have come a long way but yet in other ways still have a long way to go.  Makes you very much aware that it is a man's world.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I put 3 stars because 1 it arrived on time 2 the package was nicely sealed and 3 not damaged. But when I opened the the dvd case their was a small little piece chipped off, that was made to hold the dvd in place. That not cool!

B003XYERRM|5.0|If you like watching the Showtime TV show The Tudors, you'll love this book.  It's a long book, but a serious pageturner packed with suspense and a constant string of overlapping drama-- war, love, hate, battlefields, jealousy, trust, loyalty, deceit, conspiracy, incest, seduction, polygamy-- and all this based on real historical accounts.  Sunne in Splendour is about the life of Richard III (1452-1485), a long-time controversial character in English history.  The book starts with Richard's life at age 7, a civil war that tore his family apart and killed several of his kins, including his father and brother.  The House of York (Richard's family) is at civil war with the Lancastrians in pursuit of the crown.<br /><br />According to the Afterword, all but one major character in the book are real people.  The author is a historian who studied the life of Richard III.  The book provides an alternative perspective to popular knowledge of Richard's character and life events.  Richard's life was widely slandered by his enemies after his death: a great case of victors write history.  If you read Shakespeare's account of Richard III, you find a tragic story of a horrible person who lived a horrible life.  Reading Sunne in Splendour, you'll find yourself sympathizing with all the characters, and that they lived wretched lives because the world was ill-ordered back then.  There's constant ambition to spill blood in pursuit of wealth and power, while trust and true friendship was rare.<br /><br />Stylistically, this book is beautifully written.  Not only is it a great fictional pageturner, but the author also did a great job giving readers a vivid picture of how life was like back in the medieval times.  The streets, the buildings, sounds, smells, people's clothes, their gender roles, even their body size and stature are depicted in this story.  The dialogs between characters give you a sense of just how treacherous and deceitful people were back then, and how competitive and tough life was for the people who took part of defining the world and government we have today.<br /><br />If you like to travel in Europe, it's fun to visit the places mentioned in this book.  Recommendations: Visit the City of York.  Find a comfortable bench across the River Thames in front of the Tower of London.  Visit Westminster.  Sit down with a beer in a cozy cafe in Brugge or Antwerp (current day Belgium, but in the book it's Burgundy).  If you're in Northern England, visit castles and major battlefields mentioned in the book, including Fotheringhay, Middleham, Pontefract, Sheriff Hutton, Towton, Tewkesbury, and Bosworth Field.<br /><br />In terms of the physical aspects of the book, I like the Kindle version better than paperback, because the print is really small.  I'm a bit of a font snob-- I think everything should be at 11pt font and 1.5 spacing.  With a book this thick, it's hard to publish it with larger print, but the print is so cramped on the page it takes away the joy of reading.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: Do not look up Richard III on Wikipedia until you finish the book.  If you want to see what he looks like, do an image search, but beware of text descriptions of his life, otherwise you'll spoil the ending of the story for yourself.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This woman is a god awful writer. However, the material in the book is dirty, funny, and addictive. Also a fast read.

B007WPM4P0|5.0|We enjoyed this first episode of Birdsong that we had somehow missed.  We were happy that we could get it through Amazon.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I got this book the day that it came out, I actually pre-ordered but completely forgot til I looked in my kindle app.<br />I waited to read it when I had nothing to do since these books usually are not my type.<br />I was pleasantly surprised with the book, I even had a difficult time putting it down. It was a fast but fun read.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone that loves these cheesy/predictable story lines.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Living in Israel, it would be a little hard to get the hardback edition of Tim's book without spending a fortune, so I got the Kindle version.  I'm enjoying it, but there is definitely something lacking (besides color, I like to use cookbooks in the kitchen where they get splattered with food).<br /><br />I've been reading about Tim's philosophies for a few years now and I find his thoughts inspiring, but I'm not the kind of person who mindlessly follows a guru over a bed of hot coals.  I prefer to choose from several and use whatever works for me.  Tim isn't for everyone and I would be the first person to suggest reading some of his stuff online first.<br /><br />When I read the first section of the book, the image came to me that if you want to live life to the fullest (Tim's main philosophy, in my opinion), it's a little hard to believe that you could if you eat from a can over the sink with a plastic spoon.  Three times a day (on average), you have to fuel your body with something and if you are incapable of boiling water, then how can you envision yourself as the master of your own destiny?<br /><br />Tim has lists of tools and tips and tricks and that's great for someone who is totally clueless in the kitchen.  It lets you hit the ground running.  I'm not totally clueless in the kitchen, but I do like inspiration and shortcuts and Tim provides both in quantity.<br /><br />True story:  I'm in the middle of the book now and as it happens my stove is broken.  The oven works and I have a toaster oven.  The first recipe in Tim's book is Osso Buko, a dish made in the oven.  So I decided to give it a try.  Here's the other problem.  In Israel, the various ingredients are not easily found.  So I substituted the ingredients and relied only on the principles given for the dish.  And the result was very good!<br /><br />More than that, I'm not on the slow-carb diet (read his other books for more on that) and I didn't know what I would do without the addition of rice/pasta/potatoes on the side.  The biggest surprise was that the Osso Buko variation I made was filling without the carb additions.<br /><br />If you want to learn how to cook, it's worthwhile to buy the book.  But if you want to gain confidence in yourself by using the vehicle of excellent food that you don't have to be embarrassed about serving to friends, then buy this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome. I got it and I was amazed. lolz the game is so fun :) get it!
B000034DHT|4.0|I enjoyed Juliet Stevenson's emotionally attuned reading of this classic work of modernism, with its challenging interweaving of time and point of view.  I recommend that the listener have at least a synopsis of the story at hand before listening.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|From the first show of Season 1, I was hooked!  The cast is marvelous...Dame Maggie Smith is superb in her role as the matriarch...and the intertwining story lines keep you coming back for more.  Anxiously awaiting Season 3 beginning January 6 in the U.S.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I bought two US pressed box sets.  BOTH OF THEM had equally bad pressings, same issues.  All discs are either warped or/and pressed off-center, have non-fill and many other issues.  In addition, they look like crap, as well.  Returned for refund and purchased EU box set instead.

B001CDLATE|5.0|Go read Ebert's review of this movie.  It is one of the greatest videos I've ever seen.  I recently saw Samsara, which is a related work, and it too was wonderful.  We live in a beautiful, tragic world and this film perfectly captures it.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|...but the fact that there are so many pieces of his other works make this a magical movie.  It garnered a great deal of press and I don't really know why because so many of his other works are, dare I say it, better - but this is a sweet, even if slightlly off-putting addition to my collection.  Even if your not a WA fan, it's still a good movie to have seen.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is hands down the best book I have read in a year.  And, I read A LOT!!!  I have recommended this book to absolutely everyone I know!  It is unexpected in the very best way.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|When I finally got around to watching this movie I could have kicked myself for waiting so long.  I remember Roald Dahl stories from my childhood as well as the wonderful stop motion animation but this movie blows my mind.  Not only is it a great piece of nostalgia, but the dialogue and the &#34;acting&#34; is so wonderful, you forgot you're watching puppets.  When Mr. Fix addresses Ash in an apology, it's right there with some of my favorite movie moments in history.  Definitely recommend this wry story for everyone in the family.
0307592731|1.0|Cheryl Strayed writes well, which is the only reason I finished the book.  Strayed, the narrator, is so utterly self-centered that the reader becomes bored and impatient.  I read on though, hoping that her arduous hike would provoke a change in her character.  No such luck.  She is as selfish and oblivious to her fellow man in the end as she was at the outset.

B002RSQGQK|5.0|Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelley made a fine duo in uncovering a murder that takes place right out the window of Jeff's (Jimmy Stewart) apartment.<br /><br />Jeff, a photographer, has broken his leg and is confined to a wheelchair in his apartment, so he spends all his time spying on his neighbors.  He sees some suspicious activity by one of his neighbors and comes to the conclusion that he killed his wife.  No one believes him at first, and the film is about the search for that truth.

B000EBD9TY|5.0|This classic Tennessee Williams play turned movie stars Marlon Brando at his finest, as brutal, reckless, abusive Stanley Kowalski.  The film does turn off the homoerotic subtext that is in the play; however that is due to the Hays Code in Hollywood during the 50's.

0788844989|5.0|My VHS version of this movie broke while showing to one of my Spanish classes.  It is one of my all time favorites so I had no other choice but to repurchase. It only took about 3 days to arrive to NY from Ohio so I was impressed with the new seller.  It arrived fully sealed as promised so I will continue to show and enjoy the movie tomorrow.  I never had the second disc which should be interesting because Julie Taymor, who also did all the artistic elements for Lion King on Broadway is amazing

B000HKYBXA|5.0|Some people think that Kennneth Branagh&#34;s &#34;Hamlet&#34; is just too much--right out there over the top.  Yeah, it is.  But I love it!  If Shakespeare had had the means, I think he would have done the same.  Branagh puts on gobs of stuff to surround our hero, but all that fluffy stuff does not distract from the suffering of Hamlet.  Wonderful production.

B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Definitely a great way to bring Gangstar to a challenging position for GTA. Rio is a beautiful city with so much to get yourself in trouble.... Some choppiness, yet let us remember this is a Kindle game.... nothing more. With amazing side missions, many missions, great story line, and so much of Rio to freely explore, the only downside is the lack of any multiplayer.... Gameloft, create an online multiplayer version of Gangstar... and just imagine the possibilities!
B0096CDG0O|2.0|App doesn't need to know my location or read my contacts.  Combined with full Internet access = data mining.<br /><br />Can't imagine what a game like this would try to sell me in app either.<br />Money grab.<br /><br />Developer admits in the description that Hasbro's Yahtzee was ripped off.<br />Unoriginal,  attempting to profit off others' work.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is always a great story teller and I devour his books as soon as they come out. Mitch Rapp is a great character.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I really enjoyed it (surprise). It's not so much the actual instructions or tips (which are great!), but the direction it puts you on. An inspiration to declutter if I ever read one! I find myself decluttering even recipes and groceries, steps in getting ready in the morning and everything else I can think of - and I love it!!<br />Simplicity is Freedom!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|My son (who is 6 years old) brought home this book home from his school library.  I was a little worried at first about some of the imagary, not too graphic but keep in mind I'm reading to a six year old who's most voilent show is Pokeman.  But it has not caused any nightmares.  He has remained interested in it, which is great since it is a long book, especially to read aloud at bedtime.  We can't wait to read the whole series.

This may be an operating system problem, but I have used other ambience apps that were able to loop with no gap.
0316069434|5.0|The Black Box is one of Harry Bosch's best cases.  A woman is found shot to death in an alley during the Rodney King riots.  She is a Scandinavian photographer/journalist.  Years later the gun which killed her surfaces.  It has been used to kill several other people.  Harry investigates, seeking to close a cold case.  On the face of it this is a straightforward novel, but the skills required for its execution are considerable.<br /><br />Given the novel's nature I do not want to spoil the reader's experience by saying too much about the details of the plot.  Suffice to say that in this case we follow the gun (not the cash).<br /><br />Connelly takes us through Bosch's thoughts and procedures, at eye level.  We see what he sees and we learn how and why he attempts to solve the case in the manner that he chooses.  In some ways, detective stories simply involve going from one person to the next, asking questions and piecing together a complex puzzle.  That is true, in general terms, for The Black Box.  The enormity of the task, however, is such that we are drawn into the case, wondering how on earth Harry will do what Harry does.<br /><br />When we see what he does it all makes sense, even though the task seemed so daunting.  One of the first rules of mystery writing is that you have to treat the reader honestly, giving the reader the information that the detective has, and not pulling rabbits out of hats or utilizing secret, withheld information.<br /><br />The Black Box could be used as a near-perfect example of this process, except at the end where there is a bit of implausibility here and there.  As Harry investigates he is worried about his teenage daughter and he is being micromanaged by a pinheaded lieutenant.  This adds rich, personal dimensions to the story that do not, appropriately, get in the way of the story.<br /><br />The Black Box is among the very best of the Bosch novels.

B0087GYY92|5.0|I could go on and on about how Scalzi worked with the tropes common to TV SF, or how he went all meta and it was awesome, or about the characters. Or how I really loved the way story went where I wasn't really expecting it to. Instead, I'm just going to stick with telling you that I really enjoyed this book, and if you're considering buying it I suggest you stop reading reviews and just use the 'Look Inside' feature to see if it can hook you.
B0058A119G|4.0|I think Barbra Streisand is really a cut above the other so-called divas in terms of singing ability. Listen to the track 'Windmills of your mind' which is sung a cappella - the clarity of her voice, the ease with which she sings and the way she carries the tune without any musical accompaniment - it is really, really good.

1451608659|2.0|For the record, I love women's gymnastics, especially the Magnificent Seven (I still have their Wheaties box). I was shocked when I saw Dominque's book displayed at my library.  After a quick picture upload to Facebook (I have several gymnastic nerd friends that needed to know about this book), I checked out and raced home to dive in.<br />WOW! I can assure you, her \\"new\\" sister, Jennifer, was born October 1, 1987, because she stated it at least 3 times. She constantly referenced her father's upbringing in Romania as the cause of his flawed characteristics. While I understand this may be important, I don't need to be reminded about it every chapter. She did the same thing whenever she brought up her coach, Jeff, discussing how inspirational, supportive, and \\"father-like\\" he was. It's as if she thought you might have forgotten what you read 15 pages ago. In some instances, she even repeats these comments in the SAME chapter. Repetition is one thing, sequencing is another. The order of the chapters, especially at the beginning, seemed rather illogical. Worst of all, the language is incredibly elementary.<br />Because of my obsession with the Magnificent Seven, I had to finish the book. To be fair, the content was fairly new to me and made it interesting. But overall, this book was definitely lacking necessary elements. After about 60 pages in, I had to read reviews about this book, because I was in such disbelief as to how poorly it had been written. I was insulted that amazon reviewers had rated it so high, which is why I had to write my own review. The world needs to understands that just because you're famous doesn't mean you can write a good book. I will do my part with this review. I also will gently let down my facebook friends by telling them that Domnique Moceanu is an amazing gymnast, who has overcome many hardships, but she is not a good book writer- save your literary brain from torture and ask me for the cliff-notes version, instead.<br /><br />One last note, who were these other two authors?! I understand Dominque's first passion is not writing, but I can't believe two authors would put their name on this cover.<br /><br />Sorry if I'm being so harsh, but the majority's glowing reviews seriously concerns me.

It is a guide to learning anything you want to learn more efficiently.  On the cooking front, 4HC has already improved my skills.  I have been trying the international flavor profiles on scrambled eggs and I cannot express to you how amazing scrambled eggs can be.  You just have to try them yourself.  Im looking forward to learning so much more.  Now I just need to get the hardcopy when I can afford it.

B000002GBB|4.0|I listed to this and Grand Illusion growing up so sought them both out recently. I'm not sure what it says about my taste that so many of the albums I used to love growing up I can now buy for $4.99 but it works out well for me. This and Illusion are my two favorite Styx albums, the ones that came before were not as defined as I would have liked, the ones that came after all had some good material on them but slid ever more into the trappings of radio pop. During these years Styx were on top of their game. I'm not fond of James Young's Great White Hope which opens this album, but once I get past that it grows steadily better. Anchored by the power rock hits Blue Collar Man and Renegade, both great songs, the rest of the album delivers tastes of folk (Sing for the Day), straight ahead rock(I'm Okay), and progressive songs such as Pieces of Eight and Lords of the Ring. I don't need to recommend this to Styx fans but if you're interested in a very good classic rock album and a great way to sample this band when they were at their best I'd recommend this or Grand Illusion to start.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Absolutely loved both Nolan movies before this.  When I heard Bane (a mindless idiot in the Clooney-wreck) was the main villain, I was pretty skeptical.  I have seen that movie, and how could that Bane ever measure up to Heath Ledger's showing as the Joker?<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised.  I think the true hero of this film is the writer, could not have been better.  CAUTION CONTAINS SPOILERS:  The end of this movie has so many plot twists it's incredible, then everything gets wrapped up perfectly.  If he weren't dead, I'd suggest Shakespeare wrote it, it's that good.  SPOILERS END<br /><br />Buy the movie.  As a conclusion of the trilogy, it's epic, even as a stand-alone, it's still 5/5.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like most people who follow Grisham, I came on board with The Firm.  SINCE them John Grisham has never disappointed me.  In The Racketeer he has a great plot and he demonstrates his craft and artistry in identifying the good, the bad and the ugly in our society.  YOU GO JOHN.  A truly entertaining journey that required my dictionary to learn about new words and legal concepts.
B00422LESO|5.0|I really loved this book. It was cute, well written and I missed the characters when I was done. I bought it a while back and then didn't read it because I have to say that the book description did not catch me. I like Jane Austen, but not THAT much - so I thought I wouldn't appreciate the book. But I am so glad I finally read it! Highly recommended!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just had to read this book to see what all the buzz was about. I heard that it was about a rich guy who secretly liked super freaky sex so it peaked my interest! It's different from the urban fiction that I usually read but I enjoyed it. I'm sure I'm not the only woman who imagined being Ana whenever the intimate scenes came :). Great read!!!!
B000001EYW|4.0|When this CD came out..they where way over due in my opinion! Really good to hear them shift back to the style that drew me to them to begin with.

B001PTG4BO|3.0|Carl Friedrich Gauss and Vilfredo Pareto both gave their name to a statistical distribution. The Gaussian distribution, or bell curve (also known as the normal distribution,) reaches its peak at zero and quickly falls off towards plus or minus infinity. The Pareto distribution, sometimes referred to as a fat tail, heavy tail, or long tail, is an inverted J-shaped curve that approaches the vertical axis and more or less parallels the horizontal axis, converging only slowly towards zero. The normal distribution is widely used in statistics and in the social sciences, where it provides a simple and workable model for a wide variety of phenomena. For example, Adolphe Quetelet observed in the nineteenth century that the size of young men measured for conscription followed a normal curve; he then collected data on many other traits that were normally distributed, and applied his theory of the \\"normal man\\" to psychological and moral matters as well. More recently, Charles Murray wrote a controversial book titled The Bell Curve that showed IQ scores in a population following a bell-shaped normal distribution.<br /><br />The Pareto distribution, which is mathematically less tractable, also coincides with many social and economic phenomena. Originally used by Pareto to describe the allocation of wealth among individuals in a given country, it also applies to the size of cities, the occurrence of words in a text, the value of oil reserves in oil fields, or several stylized facts in finance. Indeed, \\"fat tails\\" have become a widely used concept on financial markets, where several popular authors (from Benoît Mandelbrot to Nassim Taleb) have pointed to their many applications. Analysts who use standard statistical techniques based on the normal distribution typically downplay the risk of catastrophic events or \\"black swans\\", which \\"fatten\\" the tail of the distribution curve. In The Fat Tail: The Power of Political Knowledge for Strategic Investing, political scientists Ian Bremmer and Preaton Keat go beyond the field of finance to promote the integration of social and political factors in risk analysis and strategic planning.<br /><br />So The Fat Tail was already taken as the title of a bestseller book, and technology analyst Chris Anderson had to find another catchword to describe a similarly shaped curve. The rare events which fatten and lengthen the tail of his distribution are not catastrophes or unpredictable occurrences, but sell figures of rare-to-find items or niche markets that were not formerly tended by traditional distributors. Online distribution has brought these non-hit products into the ambit of commerce. The digitalization of music and, now, of books, has further increased the sale of relatively obscure or outmoded material, pushing marginal production and distribution costs virtually to zero. In the end, everything that can be transformed from an atom to a bit, will be. The result, Anderson argues, will be a profound change in our popular culture. The niche, the obscure, and the sub-genre will gain ground at the expense of the hit, and the top dogs of mass culture will have to give way to the underdog, who will be able to find and even produce her own content.<br /><br />The book grew out of an article in Wired, which attracted considerable interest and convinced the author to couch his idea in more detail. It is not merely an extended magazine article, and there are few lengths or repetitions. The presentation follows a logical path. It opens with the opposition between blockbusters and niche markets, then details the concept of the Long Tail and its emergence along with e-commerce and digital content. It provides a simple theory of Long Tail markets (\\"make it, get it out there, and help me find it\\"), introduces a few original concepts (\\"filters\\", \\"Pro-Am\\" as in professionals and amateurs, the \\"Short Head\\") and borrows other notions from standard economics (inventory costs, network effects, price differentiation). It closes by describing the new era of unprecedented choice unleashed by the Internet, and offers a few lessons for managers and entrepreneurs.<br /><br />The book doesn't fit squarely into the popular economics category or the management book corner. Although Anderson emphasizes his data analysis and links with academic research teams, he skips the technical parts and doesn't address methodological issues. He makes little reference to standard economics, maybe because, as he underscores, economics has so far been concerned with relative scarcity, whereas The Long Tail heralds the entry into an age of abundance and unlimited supply. Anderson confesses he didn't have access to Amazon sales data: in fact, Amazon's statistics are one of the industry's best kept secret, although researchers were able to reconstruct some series through reverse-engineering. Conversely, most of the hard data offered by the book relies on the music downloads of a single company--Rhapsody--that became completely overshadowed by iTunes. The Long Tail doesn't offer new management tools or business lessons from corporate tycoons; rather, it presents some evolutions brought about by new technology and innovative business models by grouping them under a single catchphrase.<br /><br />The author doesn't claim credit for creating the concept: Jeff Bezos did, when he established the Amazon portal in 1994, and Google CEO Eric Schmidt similarly made the notion a central tenet of his business strategy. The idea hit a cord with web entrepreneurs because it provided a simple way to explain a corporate strategy to business investors who were willing to buy into the narrative of unlimited growth potential. Chris Anderson provides an interesting story of the foundation of Amazon.com, explaining how Jeff Bezos went from identifying a business opportunity to building a corporate empire out of it. Asked by his hedge fund manager to find Internet business opportunities, the young Bezos made a list of all the things that were sold remotely. Apparel was number one, but \\"you didn't want to do apparel, even though it was the best category, because apparel you could do very effectively through catalogues and through stores.\\" Books were at the bottom of the list, but they had many things to speak for them: the potential demand for published books vastly exceeded the storage capacity of brick-and-mortar retail or the size of mailing listings; each book was identified by an ISBN code, which saved data in a time of sparse capacity; and their distribution was handled by just two wholesalers, which had warehouses strategically placed around the country to serve any needs.<br /><br />Interestingly, The Long Tail doesn't belong to the long tail of published books: as a bestseller, it achieved massive sales figures, and featured in the peak part of the distribution. Books that aim for the stars and target the mass market tend to have different characteristics than long tail sellers. They use simple language and colloquialisms. They are focussed on a single idea, which provides a lense to interpret a wide variety of phenomena. Their title offers a catchphrase that aims at entering into everyday language (from \\"black swans\\" to \\"tipping points\\"). They use cross-reference to other popular books, in the hope of joining the bandwagon and achieving similar bestseller status. Among the books quoted or summarized by The Long Tail are the following blockbusters: Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan, The Wisdom of Crowds, The Rise of the Creative Class, and Republic.com. The book visibly positions itself alongside this cohort of \\"short head\\" hits.<br /><br />Last, Chris Anderson used marketing ploys and viral techniques to increase his sales and impact. Following his Wired article, he published a blog and gave many lectures with the same catchphrase title, creating a core follower group and a spirit of expectation. He made sure the corporate examples he gave were congruent with his approach, and gained a lavish endorsement by Google's CEO. The publication followed the usual pattern of hardcover, paperback, bargain price, updated edition, as well as Audiobook and e-book declinations. The conclusion of The Long Tail opened the way for his next hit, which focuses on 3D printing and custom manufacturing. These marketing tricks are usually lost on me. I tend to shun bestsellers, and I do not belong to the technology savvy. But I was seduced by the firesale price of my second-hand copy, and devoted a couple of hours to its reading.

B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Starting with what was good: The atmosphere, level design, characters all could make this game great. Additionally, I like the Mario Kart kind of vibe I was getting from the game.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is where all good will I have toward the game ends. The game seemed to have exactly one background track which was on constant loop the entire time I was playing it. Additionally, the demo only includes one track - you have to make an in-app purchase to unlock more content. Even worse, the single level they chose for the demo had pretty much nothing going on for it. It does have the benefit of having marginally better driving controls than a few other games I've tried on Android, but that is stretching it.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointed in what was offered, but am thankful that there was a free demo.

1863514260|5.0|Shading with cotton or silk embroidery thread to make lifelike flora and fauna is a recommended technique for the aspiring and advanced embroiderer. Combining colors to make this happen is often a bigger challenge than the stitching techniques. Many people struggle with the intricacies of the color wheel and the differences between tone, value and hue when it comes to color - including me. Trish Burr has made all of that easy with a book that is visual rather than analytical. The first chapters have the review of materials and techniques that all good instruction manuals have, but then Trish Burr combines the colors for you, first in charts, with reference to both DMC and Anchor Thread numbers and then in lovely miniature projects that would be at home either on their own, on a crazy quilt or as part of a larger project. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Trish Burr has made color theory and color combination accessible and visual in this book and it is a prize indeed. I note that it is sold out on amazon at the moment and there is a reason for this: Burr makes color intuitive rather than intellectual and I believe this book may prompt many fiber people to finally understand that color wheel - but even if they don't they will be able to combine colors for embroidery and other fiber projects. Truly a quiet masterpiece that will give needleworkers more practical confidence with color than almost any other work. Recommended.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you are a life long learner and want to improve yourself then this book wil help you along the way.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  It actually got me interested in flowers with the meanings and using them as an unspoken language.  The main characters choices bugged me a little but in the end you come to understand them.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille does not disappoint! John Corey makes me laugh out loud and keep reading until the end....and then anxiously waiting for the next book....
B007FIY3VW|2.0|I was looking to find a word process tool for my tablet. While this might be fine for others who are using more up-to-date programs on their desk or lap top machines it's just not working out for me.<br />The app does seem to work very well otherwise.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|So nice that I could just rent this through Amazon since it wasn't in the red box or DVD express in my tiny, remote town! I enjoyed this movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I've always found the subject of death perplexing.  This book shines a ray of light on the subject.  And, it served to answer the question as to whether near death experiences can be explained scientifically.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Really wanted to watch this with company who had never seen it. I live in a small town on the Washington coast with only one red box to choose from. That selection is soo limited so thank you for having this available! My friend laughed and laughed as I knew she would! :)
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are comfortable and sound very good for the price.  They are also durable.  I've had my original pair for six years and the only problem I've had is with the ear pads wearing out.  I also own a $750 pair of Ultrasones for critical listening, but the Sony MDRs are my standard go-to for general day-to-day recording and editing.
B004EARTN8|4.0|I just don't get the whole Ryan Reynolds `thing.' What is his appeal?<br />This movie had such potential and it is okay. Jennifer Jason Leigh `rocked' this performance better over a decade ago in a TV movie.<br /><br />I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I might buy it. It is a great group film with your friends.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Who doesn't know about Adele's amazing voice by now?  Although her sophomore album got more attention, this first try is just as good.  A must if you're even thinking about getting it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great way to gather ideas. I have gotten a lot of great recipes and projects from Pinterest.
0439023491|3.0|I'd love to review this one higher, as I loved the first two Hunger Games books but this book dragged & dragged & I thought it was so boring that I started it over a year ago & still haven't finished it when I read each of the first two in a day.  Disappointing...
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I am always looking for a deal on Blu-ray. The Alien Anthology was one I really wanted. Currently the set is on sale for $30.99 with Prime (free if member) shipping.<br /><br />Movies- These are classics which have been brought up to high def standards. I really enjoy the different versions on the disks along with the introductions. It really puts one in the mindset of directors. The disks are missing the first movie Prometheus which came out in 2012. Additionally, these videos carry over into the Predator series including Predator vs Aliens. Watch all of them starting here with the Alien Anthology.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005LAIHY0 Prometheus (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00147F8ZA AVP: Alien vs. Predator / Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (Unrated Two-Pack) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003L16FAE Predator (Ultimate Hunter Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001VFM0YW Predator 2 [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0040YFR1Y Predators (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />Box Set- The box was way nicer than I would have expected. It feels of nice quality and has great graphics throughout. If you would like to give a nice gift, this would be one of those.<br /><br />If this review helped, please hit the like button.<br />by: kraisydave
0439023483|5.0|I was worried about reading young adult lit after Harry Potter was over since what could possibly be as good?  Although this is different, it is a great book & totally lives up to all of the hype.  Maybe for an older reader than the Potter books, adults will like it too.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Works well and seems to be of good quality. IT does help remove a lot of the shake in the movie we produce. I am very happy with it so far.
0439023513|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews about this book from friends but I enjoyed every minute of it.  I thought it was a very strong folllow up to Hunger Games & am looking forward to the movie version.  A great story!
B007GFDVEE|5.0|excelente calidad , muy recomendable para niños y sus padres sobretodo a la hora de armarlo.<br />como todo lo de lego excelente .
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I got this as part of my children's DVD collection & it is still as enchanting as it was the first time I saw it.  Don't even think about it, just order!
067144901X|5.0|I realized after a few months of purchasing things as a parent, that I would see how much my child loved playing with a toy BEFORE i bought it.  Same really went with books.<br /><br />Well this is just crazy, but even in the few short pages of this tiny book, somewhere along the way it seems all children calm down and are entranced in either the wording or gee i don't really know.  Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful book with bright illustrations and fun farm characters, but there has to be some kind of \\"magic spell\\" explanation.  My kid loved it. My friends' kids all love it. And they just seem to listen.<br /><br />My son is now 18 months, but it still has  a little magic in it after being rotated with other boynton favorites.<br /><br />And for heaven sakes you MUST try the \\"Night Night Little Pookie\\".  We've insert our son's name for Pookie since he was born and always add the last two pages of \\"I love you and love you\\".  Seriously amazed and love her books.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|A Disney classic for so many reasons.  One of the best children's films ever made & it never gets old.  Every child should have this in their collection.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Love this. I don't have to worry about losing photos when I upgrade phones again. It works perfectly on my droid and my pc.
B001HN694K|5.0|A great take on the Lewis Carroll classic.  Entering Burton's Wonderland is a trip you won't soon forget.  Love it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks I've read in awhile. They were all beginning to run together, but this one was different, and I loved it. I can't wait to see the movie now!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Didn't know what to expect of this film when it first came out but it is warm & funny with many great songs.  I have watched it again & again & still love it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's very fun, but there are some challenging ones.  I like that.  All in all - a game I liked.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me wondering and intrigued till the end.  I would definitely recommend reading this book.  great suspense .
