0062101897|5.0|I bought this book for research after taking on a new job which requires knowledge of the HP film series. In literally sat w/ the book while watching the entire series while taking notes and highlighting the pages. That is why I wished to purchase the book used because I knew it would become a text book of sorts.<br /><br />Arrived in perfect time and has been a vital tool as I have begun the new job.
B008J05EL8|4.0|I had no problem getting this to work. I clicked the \\"Download Fonts\\" button when the pop-up asked if I wanted them, and it took me to the store. I purchased the font pack, and after purchasing, the OfficeSuite Pro 7 app detected it, and downloaded the fonts. I have no idea why everyone else has a problem with it. Theres even a \\"Download Fonts\\" option in the settings menu that grays out once the font pack is downloaded.<br /><br />As for the \\"This should be included in the purchase of the OfficeSuite Pro 7 app!! Hang the developers! Grawr!\\", have you tried to buy Microsoft Office on you computer? Its a few HUNDRED dollars. For twenty bucks you can get the office app that'll do everything, or for five bucks less, get the same program, just without the Microsoft fonts. Boohoo, its such a rip off to get a full office suite for twenty bucks that works on your phone, waaaaaaaaa! How bout shut up and be grateful its not more expensive. Even OpenOffice.org (which is free for your desktop) isn't as compatible as everyone makes it out to be.<br /><br />I've had no problems with this pack, works great, and its just to give your files the same font they have on your desktop. It is what it is.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I'm so addicted.. I seem to play in the eves after things settle down, and if I couldn't sleep, I'm worse off for picking the game up lol.. Up till late every time trying, just actually purchased some bombs lol.. Awesome game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so so so so so allsome because it has armor so for every thing but 0.7.0 ail have cake buckets<br />skin pack and more features after that 0.8.0 to will have rails NPC villagers sun stars and sunset moon and new blocks and more to.Comeing soon
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game so I was pretty disappointed when I beat all of the 50 waves. I hope the next update come soon
B009NY43NY|4.0|I  have been a fan of the books for years & then later the show. I feel like both are totally separate. I liked how the series ended. I am sad to see it over. I would've liked a prologue to see how things went after her decision was made. Maybe she will eventually write a follow up.
B0064MGU98|3.0|The response of a wife dealing with a husband holding a poitical office when he is discovered having a fling with another lady. Hmm. She finds a job at a law firm with a partner with whom she had her own flinf while in college. The husband goes off to jail, a spark with the old college flame still exists. The individual episodes are good, a few being quite good, but the full season arc is trying to make you, the viewer, wonder if she will end up with the husband, who is now out of jail and running for office again, or the old flame. The problem is, there is no chemistry between her and either one. The final episode killed the series for me with a cliffhanger: who will she end up with? Without any chemistry whatsoever, I didn't care.<br /><br />Okay, that's what I didn't like. What I did like was the third partner who was in two or three of the best episodes and the second partner played by Christine Baranski. Love that lady. The cast is good, they just do not fit together in a way the story-line says they should. The series continues so perhaps in season two or three some heat will be generated.
B0090SI42Y|4.0|A great way to watch stunning ladies with beautiful action. No standout performances by the cast but as an ensemble it plays very easily

B00BQH9SY0|4.0|Disclaimer: You will find no descriptives such as 'brilliant,' 'amazing' or 'best [fill in the blank]' here as followers of buzz bands want to do no matter the quality of said buzz band's anxiously anticipated output.<br /><br />What I will assign is the concurrence that The Neighbourhood, their attempt at a seamless fusing of sonic disconnect and their lofty ambitions of craftily embedding themselves into your music frontal lobe will probably succeed and do so for a number of reasons.<br /><br />The Newbury Park, CA quintet's campaign has been a stealth and skilled one as proven by their ascension in the ranks of \\"bands to watch,\\" playing it cooler than thou while rocking skinny jeans, requesting that all adhere to an established monochromatic aesthetic (perhaps they think they'll burst into flames otherwise) and front man Jesse Rutherford's bodacious neck tattoo. Now say what you want about the strategy, but it actually forced people to focus on their sound instead of spin. In truth, I Love You sits comfortably on the boundary lines they've drawn for themselves with preceding teaser EPs Thank You and I'm Sorry and goes nowhere near crossing them. But don't be mad at them because, after all, they are a band with a plan.<br /><br />Read the full review on HIGH VOLTAGE MAGAZINE- [...]

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have been a huge fan of les miz since I read the book in high school.  have seen the movies (dramas), live on stage, videos of two special presentations (love Colm Wilkinson - Valjean in the 25th anniversary special).  this cast was perfect, the visuals  amazing, and as usual the music magnificent and inspiring.  I will treasure this movie.
0800141660|5.0|I watched this movie. I really liked it. Great quality. Talented actors. No dislikes. Good as the book. SO SO FUN!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This series has never gotten stale in the entire 10 years it has been on.  Looking forward to next year!
B00B23O96A|5.0|This is one of Eric Clapton's best CD's.  It is hard to believe he is 69 years old.  This is an awesome CD.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this collection. Defiantly going in my top 10 favorite. Cant wait to see whats next. Thanks Mr. Howey!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book had my interest from beginning to end. Incredible writing, and a plot that makes you think. I highly recommend this book.
193700788X|1.0|Cut out the 30 % talking about food. Add some steamy romance. Completely rewrite this in the style of the other books and you would still have a pretty bad book. Most books put a ending chapter that is set in the future to give us an idea of what happened a couple years later. But  not C. Harris, she wants us to spend another $10.99 on a separate book. If feel like C. Harris has out grown the series and is all about money. This might not be true ,it's simply my opinion. One that is shared with many unfortunately.<br /><br />Dead Ever After : Again get rid of the food talk. Tall man ,medium plain man ? Okay ,this style was weird and out of place. Then for no reason or build up Harris reveals there identity. I honestly had to think back to who this two men were  because they weren't that big of characters in the other books. Yet C.Harris chose to make the last book about them. Eric has a kid nicknamed the \\" Karin the slaughter \\". In no way did this Karin act like an aggressive murder in the book. It was hinted that Karin's past was crazy and deadly but the character had no depth or back story.  Karin slaughter is the name of a real life crime author. Maybe C. Harris was paid(even more money)to promote the name. While if you are a true fan it is no shock to be introduced to a new species of supe, it would have been nice to wrap things up with already know characters instead of adding in \\"The Devil\\". Sookie just kept letting herself be victimized ,accepted being hunted by everyone , and left by the man she loved. Not the strong character that was built up in the other 12 books by any means.<br /><br /> I understand C. Harris couldn't please everyone with the ending but she could have at least stayed true to the previous books and to the characters that we have all invested years loving. On a personal and completely side note, I wished Sookie would have used the cluviel dor to make Eric human but in the process paid the magic price by not being ableto have kids. Her and Eric spend ten years or so in the sun living life together. Then they both turn into vampires( for Eric he turns again)together. Start the new series Sookie the vampire years! ( Not the best name but you get the drift)Eric spend ten years or so in the sun living life together. Then they both turn into vampires( for Eric he turns again)together. Start the new series Sookie the vampire years! ( Not the best name but you get the drift)
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Hardhitting and realisitic  Characters well developed  Pulls no punches as to realism  Definitely idenfified with good guys and bad guys
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a Disney movie about video games.  If you are currently reading this and not watching... just buy it and enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and has good graphics.  I used to play solitaire on my Pc and was looking for a game to play on my kindle.  This is it!  Thanks.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Ok cute and fun...but why five lives and have to wait or pat for more ?  Love that it was free to purchase.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Ouch was this movie painful to watch.  Every aspect of it was a failure and it made me only feel sorry for the older actions actors in it.  Particularly sad was Arnold's part and Jean Claude Van D's part.  Chuck Norris's part was pretty bad too.  Hell, they were all awful!  Nice idea, not great in reality.  It mains me to give it just one star, I loved all these actors' movies over the years, but man, this was a stinker.
B006PERRMY|5.0|This is a movie I will think about every once and a while and I believe it has the potential to become a cult classic.  The concept of using time for currency is thought provoking.  Yes, there is an underlying point about the rich living above their needs while the poor die, but they also show the poor stealing from each other, drinking themselves to death, and living with large and excessive debt.<br /><br />The acting is good, but I don't really feel anyone could act to the script for this movie any better.<br /><br />The movie works as a mind numbing watch just as well as a thought provoking life questioning roller coaster as I've described.
B00936A0RU|1.0|This is my most FAVORITE movie... I have watched it over 100 times.. I looked and looked and looked for it at Wal-mart and K-mart but they were always out of stock so I ordered it from amazon as I do most things I buy.. But this one inpaticular is horroble I couldn't wait to get the movie out of my P.O. Box and get it into my DVD player. Just to be soooo dissapointed.. The movie barley plays it freezes up every couple of minutes it has deep scratches in it.. It was promoted as used but in LIKE NEW condition..  Well LIKE NEW condition is BS it looks like some one laid it on the ground and rubed it around.. I have bought so many things from Amazon and never ever have had an issue with anything... until now... I am very mad aggervated I paid as much for this used version as a new one usually cost so I expected it to play without any issues.. Guess I expected to much right??  Movie is great the best but this seller needs to be honest about the condition of there products..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has large easy to read and touch buttons. My 7 year old uses the app often since it shows all the numbers that have been put in. Can't beat the price.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I found the main character very self centered. You can't have your cake and eat it too.  Either commit to your family or don't have one.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Always knew it would the way it did.  Good mystery and lots of action as usual.  And now it's done.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I want to say I like it but its too hard fromnl time to time<br />its like ispy. and when I was little I loved ispy
B005LAIIKI|1.0|This was good, until the handshake, then it was all about jamie fox showing off!!<br />It's like tartino made the first made , then jamie fox said, no the rest i do...and it will<br />be how cool I look, and bad ass over did it
B00BDAP66E|4.0|There are some glitches that pictures won't load on my phone, but feeds my Facebook addiction when I can't be at the computer.
1423154525|5.0|Son of Neptune returns to Percy Jackson, and Rick Riordan lets you know it.  There are many veiled references to previous novels that act as inside jokes between the reader and Percy; The two other narrators offer interesting histories and perspectives.  Best of all, is all of the foreshadowing for the rest of the series, especially the ending of Mark of Athena (book 3).<br /><br />I purchased the Collectors Edition, which comes in a beautiful wrap-around case of the original cover; it also features a golden press of the series emblem in the spine and cover, and signature by Rick Riordan.  It does not feature the golden pages or lithograph like Mark of Athena Collectors Edition does, but they are the stars of my book collection.<br /><br />Great book series, great characters and relationships; it has lost a little of the goofiness of the first 2 books of PJatO, but the books continue to make me laugh and do more research on Greek and Roman Myths.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie, and both of us thought it was a great movie.  Reminds us a bit of how our world works and we found it both interesting and entertaining.  A really good watch!!
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|This movie was retarded, from MI:GP to this crap??? books are better then movies I hear...and that's what it should've stayed as!<br />What was the end about, lame! you could do netter then that!!!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Super cute and funny movie. we have watched it three times already. Great addition to our family collection of movies.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|One of the best, so far, in this series. Not so violent as some of the others. Interesting characters, moves right along, I had a hard time putting it down. If you like Jack Reacher read his. If you don't know Jack... read this. It is a fine introduction to his author.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|We watched this movie and thought it was a really good plot, and the acting was fantastic!  A really good movie to enjoy!!
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Terriable movie, wining about vacation mr mcclaine, really??<br />Thats not why you where in russia you idiot, whats the deal with the scene<br />guy eating the carrot, wtf was that???
6300215741|4.0|Great story. Time well spent. Though found Grace Kelly's character surprisingly tiresome to watch - I don't remember feeling that way years ago when I watched it last. Grant is always amazing.
B00BDZV9M4|4.0|My fav is the first song on the cd \\"ianahb\\". The piano score is breathtaking! I love it!  True.... he's not as good as he use to be, but still if he stay off the drugs he could be better.
B00821OX98|3.0|This show tells a plausible story, with less-stiff cardboard characters, who seem to be cookie cutter, but the action makes up for it.  I also like how the season ends with a cliff hanger.
B00CKKDZ2S|1.0|This app is very very minimal.  Not worth the memory space.  It is not really free, because it is one of those free apps that lures you in and download just to make you pay in order to use it properly.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|this app is tons of fun, and not too slow to lvl up like in some other apps.  I love just killing time with it.<br /><br />-- Update.  I liked this game so much i decided to go ahead and support it a bit by buying the 50% coin multiplier.  I bought it and have the receipt show up in amazon.  however It doesn't work on my app.  I have restarted the app, the device, and checked another device, since it says it works on all devices on your account.  I don't have it according to the app.  they need to get that problem fixed!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy the game a lot. It's a t ok n of fun just wish the buttons were easy to press.
193700788X|4.0|Just like on a television show the series finale is not the best show. If it is done well it brings in the characters you know and love and ties up their stories so you can imagine what their future would be like. The author did just that with this book.<br /><br />I also agree that the way Charlaine Harris ended Sookie's story was right. It does not guarantee she will live happily ever after, but that is life. Sookie's happy ending is up to her and the book ended in such a way that I know she will get it.<br /><br />Thank you for years of reading enjoyment and allowing me to get the closure that so few series endings give.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|easy to locate books, large selection.turned my cell phone into a libary that i can carry with me, it's great
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I watched this because it was offered on Prime from BBC and is pre 1900's.  I love getting into the early simple years.  So well done u become one of them and laugh and cry with the characters u come to know and love.  So good to be a part of a community who pull together and are accepting and caring of each other.
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|It's a taut, suspenseful, solid entry in the action genre, and has a heckuva twist toward its end.  It's worth the $3.99 rental fee I paid.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great Series. Very good actors and very good story episodes keeps you coming back for more.  If you haven't seen it give it a try.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very addictive. Hard to put down. I keep checking for the next part to the story. My kids like it too. The subject may be too creepy for little ones but the hidden object parts of the game are fine.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|No, it's not their last album, but that's what I love about it.<br /><br />When I finally got my copy I listened to it from start to finish at least twice a day while I was work, couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the album is the boring cover art.  Asides from that, it's a seriously great record.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If u don't get it you are stupid.  Get it now and stop reading like I said five stars baby!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The game was very interesting and well thought out.  I enjoyed and would recommend it. The graphics were great and the sound effects complimented the story.
0263899403|4.0|Good story that I wasn't able to put down. I really do wish there was a bit more character development.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Another great yarn, but one which opens the door on the less than moral world we have created for ourselves, exactly when I am not sure.<br /><br />A tale of what happens to good people when they butt up against type A individuals with a lust for power and a good dollop of greed mixed in<br /><br />Four and a half stars, not five, because then Mr Le Carre may decide not to write another.
0345803485|4.0|This is another selection that I had heard so much about, then I decided to buy. I learned a lot ,and it easy an easy read.
B000006YMN|5.0|This is A MUST HAVE cd for any ABBA Fan, trust me you won't be sorry  Agnetha's voice is & always will be a voice you'll never forget.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I have several of Leonard Cohen's CD's and the fact that he has been at this for so many years is a culmination of his great status as a vocalist, a poet and a unique individual.  At first I was thinking that there should have been a bit more action in the performance, but Cohen is just mesmerizing even at 75 (I believe) and the words and his presentation is perfect.  The supporting musicians are very professional and expert in what they do which just adds to the performance overall.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|this was a well thought out,well written novella.  there were a few unresolved questions at the end.  i hope to read more in this line.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Love her sense of humor honesty. Fast paced at first slowing off towards the end.  All good though and a great bedtime read for me..
B0073COMKW|5.0|The Samsung LED bulb met my expectations. As noted in other reviews, this is not an omnidirectional bulb - it mainly casts light in a single hemisphere. I have installed it in the fixture above the kitchen sink, so it casts a bright white light. The light is not exactly warm (color temperature-wise, not heat-wise), but more warm than cool. I am considering getting these more of these for the bathroom fixtures.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I have Lana Del Rey's previous release which appears to have been a prequel to this and based on that sound I bought this.  Didn't disappoint but wish there were more songs.  Lana Del Rey's voice is very unique and just to my taste.
B000V1US2S|5.0|i haven't listened to a lot of jazz in my life, but i really like this soft stuff.  nice sound.  good quality.
1449437524|5.0|I bought this for my 83 year old mother for Mother's Day!  She and I are both dog lovers.  The book is short so don't expect a novel.  The drawing is clean and not overly done.  So many things in here reminded us of current and/or past dogs.  The comparisons in certain senarios are so true!!!!!<br /><br />I read it before I gave it to her and laughed...and read it with her and still laughed...and I am still laughing now.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Great book, but I want more closure. Does Sookie and Sam stay together? What happened to Eric and Pam? Why does Mrs. Harris tease us!?
1476733953|5.0|One of the better books I have read.  Howey transfixes the silo, the people and the politics quite well.  I couldn't put the book down.  Easy read, for sure.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|When this story started with a smalltime &#34;crook&#34; finishing up a 3 year stint in prison, there was no doubt in my mind that I had<br />bought a book of little substance.<br />How wrong I was!  &#34;American Gods&#34; gives you some of the elation/depression rollercoaster ride of a John Irving novel.  The panoply of gods, ghosts and genuine excitement made for a great fun read.  I'm going to read it again to try and gain more<br />understanding of the numerous philosophical angles with respect to gods and God.<br />This book isn't light reading it is great reading.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Sorry I was looking for a book written for adults not an &#34;adult&#34; book.  In the first few chapters she described juvenile female anatomy, Love affairs, and masturbation.  That is when I stopped reading.  It is a shame that adult means written porn.
0762445262|5.0|I bought this as a present for my nephew for Christmas. It ended up being a stocking stuffer because it was SO small. But despite it's tiny frame it is sturdy and he loves it. It makes a pretty decent sized bat signal as well for being so small. Over all my nephew adores it so it gets 5 star from me!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great acting, even better plot; sci fi plus adventure, drama, romance.  For adults who like to think and also have fun.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Wonderful and deeply satisfying.<br />Such simple writing but complex characters living difficult lives.<br />I loved and felt such a community with the family.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|I don't which I like better, Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.  Both are spectacular.  I love the special effects in Harry Potter and of course Daniel Radcliff brings our the sympathy in everyone.  I have all the serives in both video and books and watch and read them over and over again.  Each time I find something new I had missed before.  Very good!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice game. Kids like to feed horse. Would be better if game did not take so long. But I guess that makes it more realistic.
B001NS5I96|5.0|Savage Amusement and Love at First Sting were at the pinnacle of the Scorpions career.  At the height of the 80’s “Hair Metal” bands comes this band that had been around since the early 70’s and were still hammering out new and great sounding songs.  They along with several other bands stood the test of time and were better for having done that.  These two albums were and are my favorite albums from the Scorpions.  They continued to put out new songs but I found that their newer stuff wasn’t the same.  They were trying to get that sound back on some of their stuff, but seemed like they got into a rut of what I call the “Bic Lighter” songs…ballads.  They have just finished touring for the last time (or so they say) and I wish them the best in their retirement.  If anyone deserves it they do.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Most books that fall second in a series are just a bunch of words to get you from point a (book 1) to point b (book 3), this book is no different, but Ms. Condie had done so in a way that keeps the reader entertained. Filled with suspense and action this book will keep you up late into the night reading &#34;just one more capter&#34;.
0240815807|5.0|I'm still read this book and so far it's a great read. The book has a lot of mixing secrets .

B00881PTRC|4.0|I had this game on my old ITouch and played it many, many times. Nice to see it now available for the Kindle.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This game was fun but very short and there were not as many things as I would have like to cre8.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|Okay so, I bought this case on eBay (the one I'm verified for is for myself, not here yet) for my boyfriend thinking oooookay, this is going to be some cheap pleather case that will break in a week or two. Well, it's gorgeous (and trust me, I'm super picky. I don't like buying cheap stuff for my loved ones, but he REALLY wanted it).<br /><br />1. The material doesn't smell cheap at all (like PU leather does)! It actually smells kind of nice! :)<br /><br />2. The stand functionality. It props up perfectly and never falls down. You can even pick it up by the front flap while its standing horizontally and walk around with it. Unless you receive a defective case, the stand works 100% perfectly. I know because it works for us, therefore this design clearly works.<br /><br />3. It feels elegant, strong/sturdy and makes the phone easier to hold (its not slippery OR sticky like a TPU case might get if your hand sweats).<br /><br />4. People are saying that the front flap doesn't close. While I would've liked a magnetic flap or something, here is what you do to make it close and shut tight again. All you do is flip it over, lay it DOWN on the front for A SECOND (no joke!) and flip it over again, then VOILA, the flap is snug on the front of the phone, 100% closed. Don't worry, its not going to be this ugly case where the front flap is hanging up at a 180 degree angle. That would look horrible, and this case doesn't do that at ALL.<br /><br />5. The hard case in the back is very secure! Once you get the phone to snap in, its tight, secure and offers a better grip on the phone. Please believe me when I say I am SUPER jealous of my boyfriend's new case and I don't understand the bad reviews here. Sure, its understandable if the design isn't for you (maybe its difficult to answer phone calls, but its not for him. You just fold the front flap over to the back of the phone. It doesn't leave ugly creases.)<br /><br />6. Buttons! Yes, ALL buttons are accessible however I doubt this case would work with a dock or car accessories. But maybe! It's just because the black hard shell is pretty thick, which is good because it protects the phone from a fall. If anything breaks when dropping your phone, it'll be the case (Assuming its a terrible, terrible fall) and that's way better than breaking your phone! But lets face it, a fall like that isn't going to break your One, its too strong! & Yes, the IR blaster is also fully accessible. :D<br /><br />Assuming you don't receive a defective case, this is the best *FLIP* case for the HTC One. I really love this case and I bought one just like it for my HTC One, though its not here yet. :) If you have any more questions, leave comments! And please don't be rude - this is my personal experience with this case. So far, I've had a perfect 100% problem-free experience. I'm sorry if anyone else hasn't, all I can suggest is to contact the company you received it from.ase would work with a dock or car accessories. But maybe! It's just because the black hard shell is pretty thick, which is good because it protects the phone from a fall. If anything breaks when dropping your phone, it'll be the case (Assuming its a terrible, terrible fall) and that's way better than breaking your phone! But lets face it, a fall like that isn't going to break your One, its too strong! & Yes, the IR blaster is also fully accessible. :D<br /><br />Assuming you don't receive a defective case, this is the best *FLIP* case for the HTC One. I really love this case and I bought one just like it for my HTC One, though its not here yet. :) If you have any more questions, leave comments!

B00785P2QC|5.0|It is awesome. I really enjoy it.  It never crashes on me and expands my mind.  Urban<br />panning at its best. Love it
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Okay so, I bought this case on eBay (the one I'm verified for is for myself, not here yet) for my boyfriend thinking oooookay, this is going to be some cheap pleather case that will break in a week or two. Well, it's gorgeous (and trust me, I'm super picky. I don't like buying cheap stuff for my loved ones, but he REALLY wanted it).<br /><br />1. The material doesn't smell cheap at all (like PU leather does)! It actually smells kind of nice! :)<br /><br />2. The stand functionality. It props up perfectly and never falls down. You can even pick it up by the front flap while its standing horizontally and walk around with it. Unless you receive a defective case, the stand works 100% perfectly. I know because it works for us, therefore this design clearly works.<br /><br />3. It feels elegant, strong/sturdy and makes the phone easier to hold (its not slippery OR sticky like a TPU case might get if your hand sweats).<br /><br />4. People are saying that the front flap doesn't close. While I would've liked a magnetic flap or something, here is what you do to make it close and shut tight again. All you do is flip it over, lay it DOWN on the front for A SECOND (no joke!) and flip it over again, then VOILA, the flap is snug on the front of the phone, 100% closed. Don't worry, its not going to be this ugly case where the front flap is hanging up at a 180 degree angle. That would look horrible, and this case doesn't do that at ALL.<br /><br />5. The hard case in the back is very secure! Once you get the phone to snap in, its tight, secure and offers a better grip on the phone. Please believe me when I say I am SUPER jealous of my boyfriend's new case and I don't understand the bad reviews here. Sure, its understandable if the design isn't for you (maybe its difficult to answer phone calls, but its not for him. You just fold the front flap over to the back of the phone. It doesn't leave ugly creases.)<br /><br />6. Buttons! Yes, ALL buttons are accessible however I doubt this case would work with a dock or car accessories. But maybe! It's just because the black hard shell is pretty thick, which is good because it protects the phone from a fall. If anything breaks when dropping your phone, it'll be the case (Assuming its a terrible, terrible fall) and that's way better than breaking your phone!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was afraid that I wouldn't have the same layout or accessibility putting this on the kindle.  Its totally like FB on my computer!!!<br />I'm happy-as-a-lark!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good game with lots of options and many tile placement boards. I'm kinda new to Maj jong but this seems to be one that will be fun to quite awhile.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|My boyfriend introduced me to this and I was speechless!  This movie takes suspense to a whole other level.  As you think you're finally putting everything together you realize it's nothing you could have imagined.  Amazingly written and acted.  It will change you in some way or another.
B005HSL626|5.0|Highly addictive for adults & kids I love it an have it on all my devices the kids especially love it
B000W93CHC|5.0|I have read all of Ken Follett books and he literally makes history come alive.  I never would have expected history from one of my favorite mystery authors.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Yet again, Jodi Picoult wrote another amazing book. I didn't want to put the book down. It kept me on my toes until the very last page.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|not a great movie, lots of potential , but they seemed to rusy and try to push as much in as much they could
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A personal story of an Iraq warrior.  Insightful about what it takes and the daily routine of a military sniper.  It helped me understand the personal and mental sacrifices that our servicemen and women  and spouses made during the Iraq war.  A story well told capturing the mechanics of being a sniper and the feelings of a very successful one.  It is fast moving.  A very good airplane read.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This was a good film little drawn out in areas, still had you cheering for success of the charecters and all. The players capture the east coast flavor perfectly. good film maybe 1 popcorn worth
B00881PTRC|5.0|My daughter and I love to challenge each other with this game.  I like the fact that it also stimulates thinking and helps with spelling too.
B008YI91HS|5.0|For its time it was a great film. Special effects were ground breaking. the concept enticing, predictable story line, but entertaining none the less. good saturday flick for entertaining, takes you out of reality for atleast a while.
B009O2XY12|5.0|The game of Bubble Mania is really fun for my daughter to play.  When she is done with everything else ie. piano practice, reading etc. she relaxes with the game.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Fox is an idiot for cancelling this show.  I've probably watched the entire first season from start to finish over 5 times, and it never gets old.  It's my goto show.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Being brand new to face book I have very much enjoyed keeping up on the happenings of my friends and family.  Best of all it was free!!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Had to pay for this season 4 but have really enjoyed the entire series. Ready to start watching it over again.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Kids Loved it. Could not wait to play the real deal at DisneyQuest after playing the movie. Would recommend Movie
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|In other Mahjong games , there is a point where you can no longer make a match and therefore lose.  When no more matches are available here, you are told to shuffle the tiles.  In the end you have matched every tile and thus cannot lose.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Love this movie. Great filmography, acting, story line etc. would watch again. Wif is big fan of Affleck and he did not let her down.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Even though one will not always win, these games are challenging and if you keep playing you can usually finally win.  Once you win, you can replay games hoping to bet your previous time.  Playing the game over with tiles in different positions also means that once you win, you will not always win.
B00002Z88D|3.0|I bought this album after I heard Nothing Else Matters on Youtube.  The orchestra really added to that song.  Unfortunately that was the only song I really appreciated.  The rest of the album was good, classic Metallica but I bought this so I could hear their songs backdropped by the orchestra.  Most of the time, the orchestra was drowned out by drums, lead and bass guitar.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I first heard Madness and fell in love with the song.  I listened to the rest of the album and thought it was alright.  Listened to it a second time, liked it.  Third time, it's really good.  Fourth+, awesome.  They incorporate a mix of music styles that all work well together, such a talented group!
0312117337|5.0|I love the pictures on these cards.  I also love that the messages contained on each don't have any messages that could be interpreted as disturbing.  I would recommend this product to anyone mature that has the ability to look deep and honestly into themselves and whatever situation they're trying to get a message about.
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|This re-mastering from the best master that Batjac have is a pleasure to look at, except for slight dirt at the start, It was great to see  &#34;pilgrim&#34; and the big mud slide again.a great companion to &#34;The Quiet Man
B001LM1456|5.0|not sure what else to say....brings the whole Marvel series together.  watched the Avengers beforehand but still worth the background.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love having this on my  Kindle, it works great! And I can put in a location that we are going to be next week, ie; Moab, UT and see what the weather is going to be like.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|this part was made for Robert Downey Jr.  good for a few laughs and the movie was good as well.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is everything I wanted and not quite what I was expecting after reading these reviews. Maybe they redesigned the case, but it works great for me!<br /><br />I can use the stand on my lap as long as I don't push on the screen very hard or move a lot (can read a book just fine). I can also put the screen cover in the groove it was designed to go in to make the kindle sit at an ~45* angle, or rest the cover against the strap on the back to lessen the screen angle.<br /><br />I also feel like the Fire is fairly well protected in this case. It is also more convenient than the sleeve I was using. When I am done or need to take a break from studying, I just flip the screen cover on real fast and I no longer worry about the dog hitting it with her paw/falling off the couch/etc.<br /><br />I have only had it for a week or two so I can't comment about discoloring but it looks fine right now. I got the black one.<br /><br />For the price ($15) you can't beat this case IMO!<br /><br />Update: The matte black on the hard part of the case is starting to chip after a while to reveal the shiny black underneath. Still love the case and it is doing its job well.
B0095P33IW|5.0|again, the movie brings the story all together if you watched the Avengers before knowing the background on the Marvel comic characters.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I used to work at NASA, and I'm not sure how Andy Weir did it, but he was able to capture all the subtleties of how that agency works. I could picture myself back at Johnson Space Center, sitting in a meeting on how to save a stranded astronaut on Mars.<br /><br />The story is mainly told through the journal entries of stranded astronaut, Mark Whatney. Through them you get to hear about all his attempts to keep himself alive long enough to be rescued (which get very techy, but if you're an engineer, or scientist, or just like that stuff, you'll eat it up), but by far the best part of the journal is Whatney's sense of humor. I ended up highlighting probably two dozen passages that made be burst out laughing. It's a lot of engineer/scientist/geek humor, but I think it'll work for most people.<br /><br />At such a low price, and a modest page-count, you'd be crazy not to give this a shot.
B009NY43NY|5.0|As always charlaine harris has stayed true to her writing of this series. I love the fact that she doesn't repeat the previous story from the last book over and over as other series do. I love all these books and the characters in them thank you for the series and giving me one last book before the end I can't wait till October. I'm going to miss all the characters and especially Sooki and bill.
B00136JQMI|5.0|This was the first jazz album I ever owned.  Obviously, many people will have this exact same review with good reason.  There's really nothing more to say on the subject.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is an easy to use app and it seems quite accurate. Only problem I seem to have is removing a location that was selected accidentally. Not sure how to do that and I don't really care what the weather is in Borneo!
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, it was cute and the guy who played Ethan was more adorable and more interesting than the book Ethan.<br />The problem was that it was so different from the book. They might as well have named the movie something else and credited the idea from the authors of the Beautiful Creatures somewhere in the credits.<br />The ending was infuriating. That's just not in any way what happened in the book. I understand that book to movie adaptations have to have differences, but the differences in this movie almost made them separate entities entirely. The book and the movie were equally entertaining though, so it wasn't a total miss.<br />I should give it a 3 star rating, but Jeremy Irons and the guy who played Ethan deserve better.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I listen to this album almost daily after I get home from work. It is very relaxing and unusual. I have it on cd and also have loaded it onto my mp3.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I bought The City of Bones over a year ago and didn't care to invest in the rest of this series. Because of all the hype surrounding the movie I had to give it another shot. I reread the first book, and this one was on sale so I bought it and proceeded to powerhouse through the rest of The Mortal Instruments series - but I didn't stop there. I immediately moved on to The Clockwork Angel and powerhoused through the Infernal Devices trilogy. It probably took a week for me to get over my depression from finishing these books. :( I haven't been so invested into a book since I was a kid and the Harry Potter books were coming out.<br />If you read City of Bones and didn't like it, just buy this book. I promise it gets sooo much better. The whole idea of &#34;runes&#34; was foreign to me and it really threw me off, but after finishing all of these books I came to terms with it and really enjoyed the concept.<br /><br />As for City of Ashes by itself, it really drew me into the world and the characters. The turmoil over Clary and Jace being brother and sister was almost too much. I really couldn't wait for the mom to wake up and tell them what was really going on. It was almost unbearable. It was so hard not to read ahead to see if maybe by some chance they weren't brother and sister in later books. So infuriating.<br />But characters like Simon, Alec, Isabelle and most especially Magnus really came to life for me and I loved all of them. I pretty much despised all but Magnus in the first book, but Simon and Alec grew on me. I can't believe I ever disliked Simon. He's beyond awesome! Isabelle took a few more books for me to really love her. I really loved reading from all of these characters perspectives. Whenever there was dialogue with Jace, Simon, or Magnus present I would actually laugh out loud. Books rarely make me laugh externally.<br />This is, by far, the longest book review I have ever written and I didn't even type as much as I wanted to. This series is really amazing. I cannot wait for City of Heavenly Fire to come out. Once again, if you're skeptical about this series because of City of Bones, please keep reading. It's worth it!
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Love the cd. Tyler went off with the production & lyrics. all i can say is. \\"S*** was doper than, Whitney Houston's needs\\"
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|I personally like Pink's style of starting with showing the readers what the research says (various experiments), conclude, draw what the implications are for us. I think Pink's books are always well researched and easy to read. However I must say towards the end of &#34;To Sell is Human&#34; I found his style getting a bit monotonous - same pattern of presentation. I would have liked to read more about what Pink himself thinks about the Attunement, Buoyancy, Clarity pattern and how he applies it to his own career, for example. This would have been nice. Still, a useful book to go back to.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It was just what we wanted and my baby loves the movie!!! We watch it all the time!!! Item came fast and was in great shape.
1451695195|5.0|Having been in a coma myself and recovered miraculously it really captured my attention and gave me a different view of the afterlife. I am a christian and have been for some time yet I had never looked at a lot of things the way Dr. Eben describes them in this book. Never been more pleased with a purchase.

B004SJ3AXI|2.0|The game is fun but the constant stream of advertising between each game makes me want to delete it.<br />I understand that it is free and some advertising is okay but not this amount.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it the graphics and sound effects are awesome. Can't wait for more.  Worth the money would recommend  this to everyone.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Really disappointing! Great graphics Great story line!  Then They get you hooked! Pow buy the full version! That's what I thought it was! Was I wrong!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that loves zombies or something like that. It was an awesome graphic novel. Amazing!
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|watching the trailer, I thought i was in for a funny,feel good,come together kind of movie. The trailer depicts a completely different movie than what it is for the next 2 long hours! ugh. I could barely get through it. It felt hopeless on all levels. good cast. tweenage daughter was the best performance. how many unfunny, mean, depressing relationships can you show in one movie. yuck. thanks for nothing.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I like the magnetic clasp and connection on the side. It is my preferred charger. I use the other for backup.

B00271DNP4|5.0|This is my favorite of the Harry Potter books.  It has an unexpected ending and a really unusual magical feature for Hermione.
B0040I09RM|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better.  Review is for season 1, I'm already done with season 2 now.  Lots of violence, blood, drug references and nudity.  If you're not into that sort of thing, then you won't like this.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|In a nutshell, I really loved this movie, which I didn't expect. It started off with a comedic spin and was wildly entertaining. By the end, I found myself unable to hold back tears and was still attached to the story and characters. Yeah, I'd recommend it to friends for sure.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Yes, it is that good!  This whole series is  terrific,  some of the best fiction in the thriller, suspense category that I have read.  I wish there were more books in the series.
B007PFD90G|3.0|Joseph Anton confirmed two things for the reader. She confirmed Salman Rushdie to be a talented writer. She also confirmed Salman Rushdie is not a likeable man.<br /><br />It was interesting (though a bit tedious) to hear of the days of the fatwah (plus some before and after) from the author's view. The interactions with other notable authors or public figures was also intriguing. Even the snippets from letters (the one that suck out in her mind was a thank-you note to Tony Blair, which might be clever, even witty, but ultimately came off to the reader as arrogant and insulting), journals, and articles lent depth to the narrative.<br /><br />However, the lasting impression for the reader was that Salman Rushdie is essentially a rather unpleasant person. He loves his sons. He loved his wives (though arguably more before he married them than while he was married to them.) However, maybe it was the use of the third person during the entire memoir, but the author of Joseph Anton failed to engender much sympathy from the reader through the course of the book. In fact, there were a few times when she could be heard shouting \\"You idiot!\\" or \\"You arrogant sod!\\" at the audio book innocently playing on the sound system.<br /><br />There were several things that engaged the reader's attention and became a part of her mind's wonderings when the book was no longer playing. One was her own memories of those days covered in the book: the way the world changed in 1989 besides the news of one author's plight, back when mobile phones didn't exist, and email was still years away, through to the death of Princess Diana, 9/11, and other world events. Another was her interest in how the title of the book was chosen (though she had to wait well into the book to discover that.)<br /><br />The third bit that might just be the \\"take away\\" from this book for the reader came not from Rushdie, but from his mother. She said she has not a memory, but a \\"forgetory\\" where she placed all the memories she did not wish to confront again.<br /><br />All in all, the reader was glad to have listened to the book, particularly since she was able to do a lot of other things while the book was being read to her. If she had to give up actual time that could have been productive in other ways to sit and read it, she would have been most unhappy.<br /><br />She wishes Mr Rushdie good luck with the rest of his life.s she did not wish to confront again.<br /><br />All in all, the reader was glad to have listened to the book, particularly since she was able to do a lot of other things while the book was being read to her.

B008XKSW7M|3.0|My emotions are not to be trusted with this film b/c I was pregnant while viewing it. That said, I laughed and cried. It was a good, light-hearted comedy that struck true on some levels. On other levels, it was pure hollywood nonesense of course, but I was expecting that from this movie.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Thought I'd try watching one or two episodes to see if it would grab me and couldn't help but continue!  Had to see where Laura was going to go and what mischief Dorcas was going to create!  Loved the time setting and people of Lark Rise and Candleford! Watched all seasons and was sad to see it end!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|When Star Trek: The Next Generation entered its third season, it was in trouble. The critical reception to the show's second year had been mixed, producer and effective showrunner (under Rick Berman) Maurice Hurley had left and the cast were unhappy with the removal of Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher. As the third season opened, Rick Berman had to hire a largely new writing team, a new showrunner and had to bring back McFadden to appease the rest of the cast (particularly Patrick Stewart). Fortunately for his show and for the fans, Berman was lucky. The new showrunner was the talented Michael Piller and amongst the new writers were the young and energetic Ira Steven Behr, Rene Echeverria and Ronald D. Moore, all of whom would go on to define Star Trek for many years to come.<br /><br />Because of these changes, Season 3 was produced in a state of chaos. Scripts were being completed mere days before filming, leaving little time for pre-production. This can be seen in the reduced amount of location filming this season, with almost no time to book location shoots ahead of filming. However, there's a noticeable improvement in special effects thanks to the introduction of new, smaller and easier-to-shoot filming models of both the Enterprise and the Romulan warbird (which makes several appearances). New, considerably more comfortable uniforms are also introduced, to the evident comfort and relief of the actors.<br /><br />But what really makes the season work is the superior writing. Piller was keen to introduce more scenes of character interaction and development to the show. The guest cast are moved away from being the centre of the show, with their impact on the regular characters being more important. There's more continuity, with a recurring Romulan threat throughout the season (The Enemy, The Defector, Tin Man) and Worf's Klingon background being developed more thoroughly (Sins of the Father). Having been proven to be a sentient being in Season 2's excellentThe Measure of a Man, Data's evolution continues through several episodes before peaking in The Offspring, where he tries to build a new android 'daughter'. Comedy is allowed freer reign, particularly in Deja Q, Captain's Holiday and Menage a Troi, which all feature a few good laughs (Deja Q may be the funniest episode the show ever did).<br /><br />But the third season's strong reputation relies on its two absolute stand-out, inarguably, stone-cold classics. Yesterday's Enterprise is a time travel story involving parallel universes which remains fully comprehensible, features one of the best space battles the show ever did and finds an intelligent and non-cheesy way of bringing back Tasha Yar. The writing is strong, with lots of moments of subtlety (the alternate Riker and Picard don't get on) and some impressive production values and details, such as the revamping of the Enterprise bridge.<br /><br />At the end of the season we also get The Best of Both Worlds, the show's first season cliffhanger and still the best one Star Trek's ever done. The return of the Borg, the outstanding music, the character interplay between Riker and newcomer Shelby, the effects and the doom-laden, hopeless atmosphere combine to make for one of the franchise's finest hours.<br /><br />Conversely, there are only a few weak moments in the mix. The Price, The Vengeance Factor and The Most Toys are quite dull, whilst The High Ground is a commentary on the Northern Ireland Troubles which misfires completely due to the writers' poor understanding of that conflict. Who Watches the Watchers? sabotages a good premise and some excellent Enterprise scenes with some dull guest cast performances. But it's more surprising how good the show has become compared to the first two seasons, with even minor episodes like The Survivors and The Hunted coming to life and being enjoyable in a way the smaller stand-alones of the first two years struggled with.<br /><br />On a technical basis, the HD upscaling of the show is again amazing, with the same team that handled Season 1 doing the job. That means some more beautiful 3D planet renders, some outstanding effects recreations and superior reproductions of the show's colours (Season 3 is more colourful than the first two seasons). After the slightly disappointing Season 2 upgrade (the company responsible for that is not being re-used, interestingly), the S3 update is even more astonishing. For a season that was driven so much by writing changes, the extra features do a great job of focusing on the writing team and how they went about creating the best show possible and avoiding the mistakes of the first two years.<br /><br />Ultimately, the third season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (*****) is outstanding. The writers, actors and crew are all on the top of their game, dragging the so-so show of the first two seasons up in quality to become something truly impressive. The season is available now in the UK and USA.

B00AB7HESI|4.0|The game kept me entertained while I tried to complete the objectives, and it left me wondering how long it took to come up with such a creative game. However, the game was relatively short for the levels you get with it, and it was a little disappointing. Overall, it was decent, and I would recommend it to others if they had the extra 99 cents.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters in fiction. If you haven't read the series, go do so now. Child's writing is paced perfectly, absolutely enthralling, and none of his books are not without an aura of complete entertainment. This movie, on the other hand, is not really the Jack Reacher I know and love. Taken objectively, it's a decent movie, but taken as a Jack Reacher movie...eh. The acting is pretty awful, even Cruise seemed unable to pull off Reacher's short, terse sentences without sounding kind of ridiculous. The action was good, though the cameras on the hoods of cars during the chase scene seemed a little strange. The entire movie was a little strange, surreal almost. It wasn't Jack Reacher, but it was a decent enough action flick. But it has tons of problems that detract from it.

B005LAJ16I|1.0|Way, way, way too many f*-bombs and way, way, way too much nudity and way, way, way too much simulated sex scenes.  Just sayin' ... story was interesting, leading female star irritating and I only watched two episodes before I had had enough.
B009GED3HS|3.0|It jumped the shark a long time age. I now only watch now because  to find out the mother's identity.
B008MEM24S|3.0|Cute game.  Fun for my nieces and nephews, I expected more hilarious dialogue because of the cartoon but it's still charming.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game!!! Keeps the eye brain hand coordination hopping.<br />I highly recommend it. The graphics are very clear. I like it that the sound can be turned off. Don't always need it.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I played this game along with several other Storm8 games with my daughter.  My only gripe is the food last for about 10 minutes then it's gone.  You have to constantly stay on this game to reap the benefits, something I don't have the &#34;time&#34; for.  Great otherwise and has tons of options to customize, much like the other Storm8 games.  Overall fun but lacks staying power.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large buttons and how easy to use this is. It's easy to see and can do everything I need it to do on a daily basis.
B0025KW29U|5.0|After being a fan of \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" for quite some time, watching it repeatedly online and on Netflix, I thought it was high time I finally buy myself a copy!<br /><br />This is a brilliantly done piece of art! The story is fun,  following villain Dr. Horrible on his quest to join the Bad Horse Society. Along the way, he tries to woo the girl of his dreams and fight his arch nemesis, Captain Hammer. And there's singing. Fantastic singing!<br /><br />The extras also make this something worth buying! I bought the Blu-Ray and vent regretted it at all! Joss Whedon really is a geek god.
B0088TG252|5.0|very good movie. I like the action sequences but the ending was kind of lacking and did not make sense.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|Don't bother paying to see this movie. The best parts of the movie may be seen in the trailer. I gave it 2 stars just because of a few good special effects and a couple of decent fight scenes.
B008NW67E0|3.0|great harmony but sometimes the instumentation overtakes it.  i kept hearing a couple of songs played in the book store where i hang out.  due to that i bought the album.  but, those turned out to be the only two songs i really liked.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I did appreciate the extra scenes furnished in the digital extended version. There are plenty of people saying the scenes are not worth the money. Maybe they won't be watching the movies many more times than the one time. I certainly will. I purchased the digital extended versions of the previous movies but found that they do not furnish those instant streaming from my amazon library with the actual extended scenes. I know this because i own the actual discs when the moves were sold at the stores. I sorely missed the scenes I expected to be there. I actually had forgotten that they were added after the theatre version.
B009NY43NY|3.0|As with the last several Sookie novels, an elaborate coup was spun, dropping several wtf moments where you asked yourself, \\"Well that's something that needs to be followed up on NOW!\\" but for what ever reason is brushed off by Sookie several days. Then the last three chapters furiously come together with an abundance of information. Leaving the reader with a lack of solid satisfaction. Also felt like some of the characters who had bit parts were just included in the story because it's supposedly the last one. Also had a snazzy ending sentence but was a hollow ending all the same because it wasn't definite.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What a great way to end a great series. Total non-stop action. I couldn't put the book down. Very emotional ... ups and downs. If you have followed this series, this is an absolute must read.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|A book which leaves you enriched for reading it.  Its a story that starts on the backdrop of the atomic bomb and finishes with an equally dire man-made science inspired catastrophe but in between is filled with ironic and idiosyncratic humor, unconventional characters and empathy for the human condition - all narrated in the backdrop of a rasta-inspired faux-spirituality.  It is a heady cocktail that strips bare the pretensions of science, religion and social structures all at once (and in a reasonably small book too) without once coming across of preachy or full of it!<br /><br />Some may find this book to be 'meaningless', but I think that is one of themes of the book itself - it does not seek absolution for the characters or an epiphanic understanding or 'truth' for the narrator - all such pretensions are slowly slipped away and the book's cataclysmic end is a natural consequence of the ambition and apathy of different kinds of people.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Jeannie is my favorite &#34;magician&#34; next to Samantha! The packaging is really nice, but very tricky to remember how to put it all back together.

B00A196SE2|5.0|I started watching the series probably at season 3 and I was hooked. I'm quite pleased with the packaging as well.
B002QAY31Y|5.0|A terrific series, still relevant today.  Some scenes still horrify, particularly the concentration camps and some of the battle scenes.  Should be required viewing for all the war-mongers out and about.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a very compelling book.<br />Other than the ending, I liked it very much.<br />Couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Can not think of another way to end it though.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this little game. Graphics were top notch and ran smoothly on the Kindle Fire 8.9&quot;. It was difficult enough that I had to use the hint button a few times but I was not relying on it to finish a puzzle. Only complaints are that it ended after a few hours of constant play and the loading screen needs to say &quot;loading&quot; or have some sort of animation so you can tell the game hasn't locked up. I would recommend it to anyone who is good at puzzles and has about 4 hours free because you won't want to stop once you start playing! Hope they come out with the next one soon!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's an OK app. It can be a little slow but it is a nice way to pass the time and its fun to have a horse to take care of.
B009NY43NY|1.0|If I had any hope of the author reading this post, this is what I would say to her:<br /><br />Charlaine, you said repeatedly that this was the ending you had in mind from the beginning, but, characters evolve and change over time, sometimes in ways the author never suspected or originally intended.  They take on a life of their own.  I think that is what happened with Sookie and Eric throughout this series- their relationship went to a place deeper and more true than you had intended, and Eric became a much, much better character than you had intended.<br /><br />And while the fans recognized it, you, for some reason, were determined to ignore the obvious and doggedly stay the original course.  Your characters wanted to change and grow and become better, but you were determined not to let them.  I think a good author needs to listen to her characters, and follow their lead, at least a little bit.<br /><br />The way you just completely dismissed Eric and their love in this book and sent him off was so contrived it was painful.  The book read like an exercise in getting every plot-line and character to fit into a certain box- a box that no longer fit nor was appropriate.<br /><br />There are a lot better reviews of this book here than mine- I hope you read some of them and take them to heart.  I think you have been very disrespectful to the fans who have given you all of your success.  And I don't think people are crazy or over-invested with their feelings on this, and am offended that you seem to think the fans opinions mean nothing.  Yes, its just a book , but we have invested many years and dollars into reading this series- of course we care deeply about the outcome.  I think we came to know your characters better than you did, and you really should have thought more about what the fans were telling you before starting this terrible book.  I think you should rewrite the whole thing.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|read Sagan's &#34;Cosmos&#34;, then digest Hawking's &#34;A Brief History of Time&#34; and then take a deep breath and claw your way through Klauss' very cerebral (and sadly atheistic) dissertation on why there there was always something.

B0067EKYS6|4.0|Baz Luhrmann's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an eye-popping, over-the-top, hyperkinetic, loud, heavy-handed circus, opera, and kitchen sink drama. Luhrmann takes F. Scott Fitzgerald's quiet, brief, cerebral novel and forces it through a kaleidoscope, crashing and scattering images in a peacock-colored, geometric Busby Berkeley dance routine. The amazing thing is, it works. The heart and soul of Fitzgerald's novel are there onscreen, and honored. Underneath the literal glitter - that sticks to characters' faces and shoulders in multicolored patterns - this is a genuinely serious film about big themes. It entertained me, it moved me, and I cared.<br /><br />I am very sensitive to color and there were scenes in Luhrmann's \\"Gatsby\\" when I was overwhelmed by chromatic sensation. There is a hotel room orgy. The women wear vivid, finger-in-your-eye obvious eye shadow that contrasts with their vivid, obtrusive colored jewelry that clashes with their crazily colored dresses which throb in contrast with the hideous, red, patterned wallpaper which I am sure is the wallpaper in the hell that bad interior decorators go to. In another scene, purple, blue, and gold metallic streamers cascade downward on a dancer in a buttercup-yellow, ostrich feather tutu.<br /><br />And it all moves so fast. That ostrich feather tutu is onscreen for seconds. The camera just keeps moving on to the next visual sensation. The costumes, the cars, the special effects, Bollywood film icon Amitabh Bachchan as Jewish gangster, Meyer Wolfsheim!!!: this movie's fabulosity budget must have been a zillion dollars.<br /><br />Luhrmann lays everything on with a trowel. Long after the audience has realized that certain characters are users whose wealth protects them from the consequences of their evil deeds, Luhrmann tells the audience that, not just by speaking those words from Fitzgerald's book, but by writing the words out on the screen. Luhrmann shows, he tells, he beats you over the head. Only twice, though, did I feel he'd gone too far. Once when an obviously fake shooting star crossed the screen not once but I think three times, and when a character, struck by a car, is shown hurtling through space not once but twice. Once really was enough in both cases - one shooting star, one hurtling corpse.<br /><br />There is a scene in this movie that took my breath away. After all that jazz, and color and movement, the movie just ... stops. It stops in a hotel room. If you've seen the film, you know exactly which scene I'm talking about. There are no special effects in this scene, no fireworks, no presto changeo. It's just a group of people sitting around talking. And suddenly you feel as if you are on Broadway watching a Tony-winning production of Eugene O'Neill. That scene make my guts churn; it broke my heart. Is Luhrmann showing off here? Saying, See, I could hook you in with fabulousness, and now I will move you with nothing more magical than words and real feelings.<br /><br />The cast is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio totally owns Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio manages to be human amidst all the glitz. He conveys Gatsby's power and his vulnerability. His voice is perfect; he sounds like someone trying to sound like a Kennedy. Joel Edgerton inhabits Tom Buchanan's brutality and snobbery. Isla Fisher is solid trash. Carey Mulligan brings Daisy to charming, pathetic, despicable life. Tobey Maguire is appropriately observant, lost, tempted, and jaded as Nick. Gorgeous Elizabeth Debicki channels Kirsten Scott Thomas. Richard Carter conveys quiet menace as a character whose job it is to announce, \\"Chicago is calling.\\" If you can make that line scary, you are very talented.<br /><br />The soundtrack mixes genuine jazz age music with rap-influenced music, and it works, too.feel he'd gone too far.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I knew the minute I heard the title of this book, . it was a must-read for me.  If you were alive,you remember; not only where you were,but most likely the finest of details of 11/22/63.  I was only in the first grade and I remember the clothes I had on.  Being so young,of course, I didn't realize the gravity of the situation...I knew I was seeing my parents, Aunts and Uncles... crying and glued to the TV for days.  Since then, I know we've all asked, WHAT IF???  You will love this rendition of \\" What If?\\".  You will laugh, cry, cheer and jeer...and you won't want it to end.  Once again, Thank-You, Stephen King!

B00A0NOF7G|3.0|I got this book for free on Amazon, but my review is based on how I felt after reading it and was not influenced by price.<br /><br />Fairly typical contemporary cozy.  Woman lives in her Nana's house, right next to sexy police detective.  She runs a bakery/cafe with her best friend (who gets no real book time).  Nana's got a group of sleuthy friends at the old folks home who are supposed to help Lexy (but are also wasted in this story).  Lexy is cute, no gorgeous, and wears stilettos and other uber expensive shoes all day at the bakery (I hate fashion stupid, excuse me, fashion conscious heroines, who are inappropriately dressed for their jobs/sleuthing).<br /><br />I don't believe there was a single possessive apostrophe in the entire book, but other than 1 or 2 typos that's all I noticed and it didn't really bother me.<br /><br />The story line was predicatble and simple with Lexy finding a button being the clue to the killer more than any actual detection work.  It only took me about 30-40 min. to read and if I got another for free, I'd read it, but I wouldn't spend the money, even $2.99 on another book in the series.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|This is the first review I have written anywhere for anything.<br /><br />If you have come this far you are going to read this book no matter what. With that said this is a fitting conclusion to a truly epic saga.<br /><br />The battle sequences really made you feel you were in the thick of the action. The three main characters roles in the conclusion were contrasted well with each other and this made the book's tempo not too taxing considering all of the action that took place. The pace of the book was much better than some of the middle installments which tended to drag on.<br /><br />There are some loose ends in the story and it would have been nice if some of these were tied up, but they do not detract from the overall conclusion of the story. Maybe they were left open to allow for off-shoot novels, we will see, or for us to make our own adventures.<br /><br />In the end this story is a simple one of good and evil, right and wrong, moral choices, delivered on a truly massive scale.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|The characters and story were simple and refined. The film was beautifully made. It makes you want to go climb the nearest mountain... well, almost.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Read this book last year, after randomly picking it up in a book store - Wow. I could not put it down.<br /><br />Highly original (I thought), and gripping account of this woman's and son terrible adventures - as seen from the eyes of the young boy. Many times I thought \\"wait a minute, that can't be\\" - but then again, how can we ever know what it would be like for a child to really not know the world outside of a small closet and room? Plus the fact that the author seems to have researched the topic extensively through conversations with child psychiatrists - all lend this book a lot of credibility.

193700788X|4.0|Let's be logical: Sookie could NOT continue to be with a vampire...Eric, in this case...for very much longer without becoming a vampire herself.  Simple logic: humans age. Who she did choose, at least apparently, is someone who loves her very much, has always had her back, is (more or less) human...at least warm-blooded, and knows her well.  Eric is hot, but has always put himself first.  That does NOT make him a good choice, people, as anyone of us who has ever married someone hot and then discovered that that is not enough to sustain a relationship knows very well.<br /><br />I thought the plot was a page-turner.  It was nice to see Sookie finally get some serious help and support.  Hopefully, in her future, people and supes will stop trying to kill her!

193700788X|3.0|Let me start by saying the book is beautiful. The mint green and pink. Then you open it up and theirs a moon and some of the characters walking around it. Beautiful.<br />I'm a huge fan of this series. I was hooked with the very first book and I just couldn't read them fast enough. Such unusual characters and the sleepy southern town of Bon Temps was so fascinating to me. Through the years, the books have lost some of their unusualness, they've gotten kinda ho hum. To be honest all the hype about the book and the ending being outed in Germany made me kinda dread to read it, even though I wanted to. I avoided all press about this book until I had read it. This book was much like the last one being that it just kinda strummed along, no hurry, nothing to do or say. Nothing in the book really grabbed my by the throat and I was scrambling to breathe with excitement or lust. I would liked to have read some spectacular awesomeness in the book even if it did have the same ending. It was a fun, fast read. I like the writing, just maybe not what was written. CH was done with these characters a long time ago and it does show. Sookie did say many times in previous books she wanted kids, and somewhat of a normal life. Well Sam is pretty normal and he can give her puppies. Sookie was done with all the drama the vampires carry with them. Maybe Eric should have been killed off and sookie mourned for a while and then realized Sam. That would have been some damn good drama to brighten up a boring book. In the end I'm glad I read it. I have loved the series and CH writing style. I have my pre order in for the what happened to the characters afterwards and cemetery<br /> girl.

0345308239|3.0|Barbara Tuchmann is one of my favorite historians, and I appreciate the seriousness of her scholarship, the beauty of her writing, and the meticulousness of her research.  I really enjoyed \\"The Guns of August\\" and \\"Stilwell and the American Experience in China,\\" and I came into \\"The March of Folly\\" with great expectations.<br /><br />In this very long book (it's less than 400 pages, but feels like over a thousand pages), Barbara Tuchmann explores the narrow-minded selfishness and stupidity of the ruling elite in four instances:  how Troy fell victim to the Greek Horse, why the Renaissance Popes failed to reverse the decline of the Catholic Church, how the British caused the American Revolution, and why America became ensnared in Vietnam.<br /><br />I had issues with the first section because Troy is ultimately a legend, and I am not sure if it was wise for a noted historian to engage in too much speculation.  In the second section, why the Renaissance Popes fell to halt the decline of the church is entirely obvious:  all the popes were much too concerned with extending their own narrow immediate interests and those of their family to concern themselves with long-term existentialist threats to the Church.  In the third section, Tuchmann is rather too cruel and arrogant vis-a-vis the British ruling elite, a cabal of 200 families who were trained to rule at Eton and Westminster, Oxford and Cambridge.  In Tuchmann's narrative, the British nobility is far too concerned with enjoying themselves in their country estates to actually bother with the maintenance of an empire, and while that may be true it doesn't quite explain how they had an empire to maintain in the first place.  And in the final section, Tuchmann's treatment of the Vietnam issue displays her desperate unwillingness to accept that the fact of public life is the obtainment of public power for private gain, and policy is determined by horse-trading of cabals and not by cool and deliberate analysis of what's in the national interest.<br /><br />In her concluding words in a rather long and meandering rant about the human condition, Tuchmann calls for the public -- especially the American public -- to elect into power men of character and moral courage, as though these men are waiting in their country estates in abundance to take up the public trust.  Ultimately, politics and power attract those with the ability to manipulate others, to dissemble in front of the public, to put political expediency before principles, and to form and break coalitions at the drop of a dime.  That's why the human experience has been a relentless march of folly.

B007Q0K9TE|3.0|We attended the screening of this concert at our local theater (we were the only ones there, so we had the theater all to ourselves). So I was very disappointed when the DVD had damaged tracks when the new waltz by Sir Anthony Hopkins & Supercalifragilistic were played.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game that helps for understanding horses and having fun! It's a good game for friends too! Yeah.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|A great end to a fantastic book series.  Loved Clarke's writing and the story.  Truly a talented writer and storyteller.  Highly recommended.  Read them all in order for the best experience.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Love it! This game is a blast. Theres so much creativity in it. Its so cute and vibrant. There are so many possibilities.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Saw the movie when it was new.  Finally read 2001 many years later.  Enjoyed them both.<br />Much of the movie now makes more sense.  Great stuff!
1401937519|5.0|If you have an open mind and are available for a new way of thinking about yourself you'll love this book but If you are a diehard religious dogma person don't read this book as it will challenge you to really think. I personally loved the book as it validated much of what I believe, that we are controlled by fear rather than faith and love.  That God is pure lovey and visits hardships  on no one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A fascinating take on what could happen to survivors in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust and to the true natura of human society.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I was so glad to find this game.  I had it on my PC a couple years ago, glad to have it back.
B0095MVOMC|2.0|I really can't say much more about this game not to exciting...but I haven't deleted it as of yet but getting close
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's a book talking about the uncertainty freshman year in high school through Charlie's eye. We all been through the time in high school, and reading it makes me realized that I wasn't the only one has that problem. Being not cool enough to hang out with cool people, being bullied or having trouble finding your love... It's a well-written book and the movie is equally awesome.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this series. If you like period drama, this is a must watch. Season II takes place during WW1 and gives viewers a real sense of what it was like to live through this time in history from many perspectives. A perfect drama with bits of humor, it is completely engaging,  I'll be watching this more than once. Oh, and Maggie Smith is awesome.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|WELL RECEIVED . WE USED IT IN SCHOOL AND AT CHURCH.  A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMENTS WERE A PART OF THE FEEDBACK FROM THIS ENLIGHTENMENT.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Just an overall great movie! Excellent acting and a very touching story. Highly recommended for a night at home, rent it!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Bought this for my son. He likes action movies. Thank you.
0345525558|5.0|Well crafted writing and a great Book Club discussion.  The author pulled us all in to her story and characters.
193700788X|1.0|***spoiler alert***<br /><br />Ok, what happened? Did I just read 12 books before Dead Ever After and erroneously thought they were about a southern girl in love with vampires. Bill the D, and Eric the viking? Wait wait, Is Harris taking a page from Lost and having a flash Sideways where Sookie is annoying, Eric is practical, Sam is uh... Wait for it, hot, and villains are after Sookie because she is...  unlucky?<br /><br />The author completely screwed us from our HEA out of sheer pride. How does she expect us to believe that Sookie Stackhouse would simply turn her back to Eric, and all supernaturals because \\"oh yeah, suddenly I see it, you all are not practical so shoo, you hear me, shoo. I have babies to make and skin cancer ah'waiting.\\"  I don't think so. Not on the prick of a wrist. Harris, did your publisher forget to print parts of the book? Maybe you should check on that, pronto. If not, then I am here to tell you that a writer does not tell you what is happening, they show you, and I did not see anything other then the will of an author to piss everybody off because they can.<br /><br />Again, I have no problems with unexpected endings, but I do have an issue with overly-convoluted, boring and implausible plot. Harris, go back to the drawing board and write the story that actually follows the previous 12 books, and called this one what it is \\"Flash Sideways: The story of an idiot.\\"
B0057FWSQ2|4.0|I mostly bought this so I could hear &#34;Dancing Barefoot&#34; which is a favorite of mine.  The songs from her early albums are fantastic, the later stuff is more mixed.  There are longer best ofs for her but this is anice primer for the newbie.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|This one goes down with II and VI as one of my favorites. It's humorous, adventurous, and quite fun to watch.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|I used mine to store my micro SD cards for my Andriod. Duh! with the Jellybean Picture. The card holder holds them securely. Micro SD easily slides into holder. A little hard to pull out as you need nails to catch the slight notch of the card. This is not the card holders fault. I am plaeased.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am 15 and this game makes you want to play it and play it in your sleep that's how a game needs to be like
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy the ease of changing to different translations. Scripture of the day gets me going. Gods word is always handy.
B0041D843M|5.0|I found this book to be one of the best books I have ever read and I believe it saved my life thank you Doctor Campbell!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|She just loves this  show.  She was behind a season and was so excited to see you guys had it.  Great show she was laughing, crying and all emotional with this season.  She says it is one of the best shows ever.  The show it's just so different from any show on tv.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love the graphics and the suits the missions I think the are the best  my favorite  mission was the one with crimson dynamo
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Lots of action which is to be expected! The story flows well and Megan Fox replacement was done in a tactful way!! Highly recommend!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|From the beginning your locked in....it definitely makes time fly by. Great puzzles really enjoyed the ingenuity of the game.Looking forward to next release.
B0086700CM|5.0|it's a great game. it can be hard and you need to be fast and you really need to pay attention
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This album is amazing, and I cannot believe that FoB has been able to come out with yet another masterpiece of an album. I am a lifelong fan of this band (well as long as they have been a band anyway) and I can't express emphatically enough how perfect this set of tracks is. I recommend listening through it several times over at first, to get a feel for the music on this album - it's a little different than anything the boys have done before. The 80s vibe is distinct and hot hot hot. Give it a try. You won't regret it!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when beginning the book but it captured my attention immediately! I was most impressed with how the author laid out the details of Pat's past while keeping the reader in suspense. I enjoyed it from start to finish!
B00CATSONE|3.0|I truly admire the author's desire for what seems to be an interaction of diverse ideas and principles inspired by creative effort; the active collaboration of which would lend an exponential increase in new opportunities for ppl- those of us who wonder what our great-grandchildren will breathe and swim in. The breathtaking laissez-faire among the larger portion of the populace in not simply complaining: but just trying to bury their collective heads in the sand is to myself.... cruelly unusual. I am an audio engineer/ musician and have been long obsessed with quantum theory and physics and it was with great interest that I discovered that Tesla believed as I- the theory of relativity is flawed fundamentally. The theory of time is an artificial man-made abstract; not even a construct...the only actual dynamic is change. This presents messy problems of quantitative expression. The theory of relativity demonstrates how we are trapped within the confines of our immediate senses; a d a. inability to venture  outside the box as well as the human proclivity to take cues from familiar environmental phenomena I.e. the music of the spheres giving rise to the clockwork- frought \\"means\\" by which to understand the repercussions of action....a side-effect. Tesla and Einstein's collective genius was enough according to anecdote to produce the immediately deep-sixed Philidelphia Experiment.  The alleged travel of the Philidelphia was not though time but was extra-dimensional. Time: and I believe Tesla might have concurred; is not a unidirectionally focused/static imposition only allowing for forward moment(um)s; rather we[[ASIN:B00CATSONE Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century]] move through the field laterally. The decisions and changes thereby cause our destiny to become real within an infinite construct of parallel possibles.<br />  I gave the book 3stars because of its tedious writing and the fact that I read it before I could finish a bowl of  ramen. Having said that I would not have responded the way I did to it which although factually impoverished did im-<br />press me with its albeit hackneyed and decidedly uninspiring cheer for nurturing creativity. Creativity is food for the is  soul and inexhaustible. Overall a good effort.[[ASIN:B00CATSONE Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century]]
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. It is soooooo worth the seven dollars. I wish I could rate it a million stars. This game is awesome.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|I love it. Please keep providing a wonderful service to our community. I look forward to the next movie. Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It fun easy and it is free in cost and it has one of the best graphics I have ever seen in a free game
B0067AC5KA|5.0|One of the best trilogys I have ever read, riveting and mind blowing. Stunningly written, and I am very sad to know that these were the last works from this author.  As most great artists, and I feel he was one, he left us way too early in his career.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend the set to anyone who is interested in knowing about the seedier side of the world.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is very fun, but it keeps freezing!!!!!! It is SO annoying. Please fix this soon! I may eventually delete it if it doesn't get fixed. It's the same thing with bakery, restaurant, and fashion stories. And they have some even worse problems. But otherwise, all of the games are great!! (:
B001P06GX4|5.0|We play this game as a family.  Our six year old loves to play.  The tiles are great for our four year old to count.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best kindle games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Fantastic plot, game play, puzzles, everything. The plot was so incredibly intense I was having a small panic attack. Please make more games. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEEEEEE
B009X01ELC|5.0|Easy to use, the Kindle snapped right in.  Very sturdy, protects the Kindle Fire HD and looks very expensive, but it's not.<br />I would definitely recommend this case.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|His untimely death was a shock .  While I did not rate his book very high, it takes nothing away from his accomplishments and his outstanding service and dedication to the USA.
B005T87QCI|3.0|this is a really fun app but it takes a lot of space.my kids love it to.you should get this app its just like the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I HAD to order this for my wife she would not stop watching; season three is every bit as good as 1 and 2. But a little climatic end...
1439152802|5.0|A very fascinatiing story and having lived through the second World War and reading the news about war in Europe, I feel sure that some of this was true.  I especially liked the surprise ending, I really didn't see this coming and really enjoyed it.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I would give it five stars if you would fix the force closing every time you go to visit neighbors. Other than that this game is great! Fun for all ages.
0385347774|1.0|I had heard many people say that this was a really good book and trusted their judgement.  However, I did not like it as it jumped back and forth too much and the story was pretty u;nbelievable.  I guessed what was going on before I was half way through and I prefer being surprised.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I chose this rating because I felt it was deserved.<br />I enjoy human interest stories and I found myself living there with 86.  I will recommend this book to all my friends.<br /><br />  .
B003G94BZC|5.0|Missing David Tennant, but Matt Smith picks up and goes in this (what seems like) more funded continuation. Can't get enough of the Doctor!
1616550414|5.0|This book is possibly the best non internet source for Zelda related goodness. its concept art of characters, maps, some story changes, and notes translated from Japanese from the artist themselves. its a great read, durable, nice construction, should last a long time.<br /><br />My only problem is i know their has to be more material that they had to leave out due to the huge amount of skyward sword content, the art for Majora's Mask seemed limited in scale, its sad becasue that is my personal favorite Zelda game so far.
0064431789|5.0|The best story ever.<br />What is fun is to be wilds things too.<br />Every child should know this book and love it.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|In a lifetime of having dealt with religious people, I always found them to be, to behave and to deal with other people with arrogance and hostility, particularly it seemed to me, towards me.  I loved history and read a great deal.  It became more evident to me as I aged that religion was a great force of evil in the world, invented and professed to be what it was not, and an agent for some people to be used to control others or injure others.  I was intrigued to see what Mr Dawkins had to say, someone I admire and who is so much more knowledgeable than I am.  He did not disappoint.  This is a great work, in support of Humanity, in exposing the con job that we've all been victims of regardless of what religion you may call yours.  A Master Work.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I saw a special on TV featuring Andrea Bocelli performing on a perfect evening in Portifino -- and went online to order the CD. It is mostly magnificent music (not all the songs he did in the show ... a few different ones), but enough to make it a wonderful CD to listen to and relax. I listened while driving and it was so much more peaceful than listening to radio -- and advertising. I particularly enjoy the Italian songs and definitely recommend this CD (especially if you are an Adrea Bocelli fan).
1402210086|5.0|I am a big fan of Georgette Heyer's books.  Always a great read-funny and entertaining.  Am busy collecting all I can find.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|At first I was very surprised at how Rock Opra the songs were and I wasn't sure I liked it. Not all the songs are like the single being played on the radio. But the cd as a whole really starts to grow on you. It's musically very good. As compared to so many pop and hipster groups that just throw something together to sell a record.
1402210795|5.0|Loved the book.  It sure helped the time pass this rainy Spring.  Georgette Heyer's books are always fun and entertaining.  No drippy bodice rippers.  The plots are usually hilarious and bring to mind P.G.Wodehouse's intricate and funny plots.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|An absolutely fantastic read; incredibly written.  Mr. Baldacci writes with a unique perspective and flair for mystery.  Thankfully, he's a prolific writer so I have a plethora of reading pleasure awaiting.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I liked the game at first but soon you loss interest in it. Gets boring. Download if want but you will soon find out how boring it becomes after you download other apps.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive and very affordable it is a brilliant game this it the only game that I really like
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Really great writing, good mix of characters and they intertwined well. Credit to Kate Morton, loved the twist at the end.
0307719219|4.0|Many books about why nation's fail have been written ever since Gibbon, this one addresses more recent perspectives in detail.
B000GWE44U|4.0|This is a classic of 80's scary movie genre.  Nicholson delivered a perfect rendition of the character in King's novel, so good that even Duval's cheese acting did not distract from it.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|This is the worst Pendergast book Preston and Child have written.  I have read an enjoyed all their previous novels and even their solo works (I really enjoyed Blasphemy).  In this instance, the Helen story went off the rails in so many ways I can't even count.  I have been able to suspend disbelief in the previous works but this was too much.  We start with a dead wife who was hunting a miracle drug and somehow this leads to unknown children and Nazis in South America, all while the earlier plot lines are killed off.  It really seemed like they didn't know where to go with this story.  I won't even go into the pointless Corrie sub-plot or the fact that D'agosta seemed to only be in the book to fill pages.<br /><br />Even if you read Fever Dream and Cold Vengence, you could skip this without missing anything.<br /><br />All that being said, I have hope for their White Fire.
B004UID2LC|5.0|While reading these one star reviews, i realized that the Kindle blocks the update, so technically this is a kindle app. If you have an android phone, this isnt for you but for a kindle user like me, it works amazingly.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|My favorite album by Lady A.so far!! Every song is worth listening to :) would definitely reccomend it if you are a fan too.
B00BFBBN3G|5.0|I am not a film reviewer, and that has been done very well by other reviewers here. I just wanted to put in a vote with my five stars. I loved, loved, loved the novel, and amazingly, did not realize that other readers believed in the \\"other\\" version of Pi's story! What does that say about me, I wonder... At any rate, the film was wonderful, and the actor who played the young Pi was absolutely excellent. The adult Pi was very good as well. I had no intention of watching the film, as I usually don't when I have read the book, but ended up doing so, and I am so glad I did. I wish we had more \\"other world\\" films like this in mainstream American movies.<br />Five stars absolutely, for an outstanding film!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game keeps you moving.  It is entertaining and especially helpful while waiting in a doctors office.  Takes your mind off of everything.  Really like it.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This series was so exciting and you never really knew what was going to happen next.  With all the twists from the war and then with everything happened at downton abbey, it kept you on your toes.
0446569895|4.0|I have been thrilled to see the slew of rock-star auto biographies coming out in recent years. It seems more of our aging rockers want to capture their memories in print while they can still remember half of them, or at least make up some believable stories to fill in the blanks. Ozzy Osbourne has done the job about as well as any of his brethren and my hat is off to him. The vivid account he provides, sound effects and all, for the alcohol-induced, shotgun execution of his poor chickens is ludicrous, terrifying, and one of the funniest things I have read in quite a while (that should tell you something about my view of poultry and the food chain).<br /><br />I have heard various accounts of the tragic day guitarist Randy Rhodes died while on an Ozzy tour but there is something very heart wrenching when the words come the singer himself. What he heard, saw, and smelled in the daze of awaking to a plane ripping into his bus and crashing nearby is beyond description and yet he does the account justice and holds little back.<br /><br />The one area Ozzy does seem to pull his punches is giving any insight into his actual talent as a singer, songwriter, and musician. No explanation is given for when he first began to be viewed (by himself or others) as a singer; let alone what he did to improve his craft in the early years. He describes much of his early attempts at being in bands as half-hearted failures and then all of the sudden, he records with Black Sabbath and his voice is ready for big-time rock and roll. There are several steps of his vocal growth he simply doesn't reveal or perhaps even understand for himself.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent telling of opulence, determination, and damned good luck.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Each season gets better and better.  I can't wait for season 4, (if it happens).  The acting is wonderful and exciting.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|This album shows that this band can do more that make head-bangers happy. It's an introspective collection of basically quiet music with messages as hidden as the band is on the album jacket. Most of the songs are as hauntingly beautiful as is the music behind them. This album will \\"grow\\" on just about anyone! Good goin' Guys!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I liked this so much more than Argo.  I feel it was much more suspenceful  and exciting.  Both my husband and I loved this.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game rooks the roof of it is very good I am on level ten were you get the ring of fire from the movie.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My all time favorite musical.  I highly recommend this.  It really explained the play better to me. Loved the scenery too.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Just Plain Interesting,(rented it,then wanted to see it a couple more times).for the price,why not own a copy?. Makes sense to me :)
B001KZG99A|5.0|I love this movie.  It has great acting and a fantastic plot.  I love Robert Downey, Jr. A must see!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Well I had the widescreen VHS, I had the original DVD trilogy and I had the Coppola restoration on DVD so no way in hell was I going to get those damned blu-rays when i had three versions of the movies.  Damn you, Amazon, for making this the deal of the day.  $17.99 for the trilogy? on blu-ray.  They made me an offer I couldn't refuse.And I'm glad.  Crisp is the word that comes to mind. Don't listen to the yokels who say the picture sucks  They are working off of a 40 year old camera negative.  The picture, grainy as it is, looks just fine.  Of course, they probably paid a lot more. Go Amazon Go.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Another Amazon FAIL: this Bluray's title is says ORIGINAL when it is the adulterated CGI strewn crap that Lucas thought we needed to fully appreciate his vision.<br /><br />What Crap, Lucas.<br /><br />Its distracting from the story, it fills the movie with a detestable disney feel from an otherwise great sci-fi film.<br /><br />The effects back in 77, 80 and 83 were astounding. Imagine if CGI was added to Blade Runner just because they could, that would not make it better.<br /><br />Mono Lisa needs some digital airbrushing...<br /><br />The films are a treat to watch besides the above comments.<br /><br />The color is really great, the sound is fixed and finally feels audiophile and not grainy distortions of the theatrical release.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|this gets my mojo working.<br />some of the music may be more appropriately classified as jazz, some as rock, but it is such a great collection and the diversity is so great that, if blues is your giggity, you need to get this.<br />I have re-learned the harmonica with the one included in the set.<br />and my wife hates the noise it's making<br />so - for mother's day - i can truly say what a great purchase.
B00BRUZ5WA|5.0|Raw and emotional, this record is a win. I like reggae ok, and there's plenty here, but you'll also find some R&B, rock, and even some oldies flavor.<br /><br />I saw Brushy on youtube and wondered about his record. The samples give a good taste of the album, in retrospect, but I didn't listen to them- I just bought it and haven't looked back.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the youtube stuff, don't hesitate.<br /><br />Happy listening!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|so I am biased.  don't have a bucket list (hate the term) but the one thing I wanted to do before I died was to see LoA on the big screen and I got my choice on 4 October 2012.  What better way to expand my collection of LoA from my edited VHS, restored VHS and restored DVD to get the 4k Blu-ray.All set to get it in November and then Sandy whacked out my house.  So I waited and got it recently.  Man, what a picture.  There a res till some scenes in the movie that look so different in 4k and on blu-ray it's as if I am watching them for the first time.<br />A definite buy.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The best of the best. For adventures, these are best ones going. You cannot go wrong with this set. TOM
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I am a life long fan of the western and I count The Searchers as my favorite Western and the Sergio Leone Man with No Name Trilogy as my second; however, the genre lagged for many years after the 60s and was neatly resurrected by an offbeat but oddly standard western Silverado.  At this point the genre was reborn.  Unforgiven and Open Range, excellent westerns, came to us.  Now the master of borrowing things from other movies has brought us the ultimate Western.  Smart funny and bloody this movie will keep you both excited and also laughing out loud.  I'm not saying this movie is Mel Brooks funny but it has its moments due to extraordinarily clever performances by Christoph Waltz (it's his movie), Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio, chewing up the scenes in his first evil bastard role.  If you do not like bloody, gory westerns (and you can like the blood and gore in this movie, even if Freddy Kreuger ain't up your alley) this movie might not be for you. But if you don't mind the blood and gore when it fits in this movie, buy it because you need to re-watch it.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|Another CD for my son Mikey. He likes this cd almost as much as Lady GaGa. I like this cd too. Keep up the good work. TOM
B007REV4YI|5.0|First, there was Goldfinger, then there was Casino Royale and now there was skyfall.  Daniel Craig may not be the best Bond  - that title will always be with Sir Sean - but he has nabbed two of the three top spots.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|The film was light coverage of Alfred Hitchcock's film career and for those unfamiliar with his works and the character himself, this film might be a waste of time.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|Love the game! No IAP like people are suggesting. Sometimes hard to hit buttons on my phone but I've gotten used to it. Only bad thing is this runs very warm on my phone after about 10-15 mins and sucks the battery down really fast on HTC One.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is simple and entertaining. I play it yo kill time. No extra money spent to get to the next levels.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Different from what I normally read but really liked it.  I'm so glad I read it and didn't just go see the movie
193700788X|1.0|I was seriously upset that I paid money for this book. The excitement of the previous books was gone. Characters were brought in so fast that all the opening action was trite. It felt as if Ms. .Harris waited until the night before her deadline to throw something together. The series deserved better than it got. I feel ripped for buying this book and would never recommend it.
B007RRFUHM|4.0|This CD is stellar and her voice is amazing but her live shows you can vary easily find on youtube sound far better and have more soul... if that's at all possible.
193700788X|1.0|I feel unbelievably cheated!! I was so vested in this series and all of the characters. The conclusion was incredibly empty. In fact, the entire novel was limp. I expected so much more from you, Charlaine Harris!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I really liked this movie, but I didn't think it was as epic as everyone said it was. Denzel is a great actor and he delivers a great performance. But I think his best films were Man on Fire and American Gangster. Flight might be 3rd or 4th if I'm not forgetting something.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|the best part of this is it came fast in two days  after seeing this movie 2xs I had to own it tom does a fantastic performance of jack reacher a military  main with a unique skill to not only vanish off the radar but to take care of business.  His co star susan Matheson is a gem to look at she is the lawyer taking the case of an accused murder in which jack has no interest in until she convinces him  to look at the evidence further<br /><br />one could call this an alpha male movie but in actuality he's really the loner type  with a cocky mouth the fight scenes are great as he takes out some punks in a bar who were part of a set up plus a cool car chase scene with a 69 chevele ss which you felt the attitude as it drives down back alleys and slams in to the bad guys<br /><br /> the bad thing is this dvd had no extra features like commentaries or even an interview but the  cool part is the scene select is cued for all the best parts for a quick zoom.<br /><br />tom nails it hard.
B000002BE9|1.0|If you are just learning to sing and/or can appreciate a weak voice, then maybe won't offend; but I've only ever loved the first and the theme song, two singles which launched her career and have stayed strong. Try newer albums by her instead, where she's pushing her edge.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Finally, we see the Vikings as the people they really were. Men of ambition with families and dreams. Yes, like many &#34;primitive&#34; societies they were violent, to a degree.<br /><br />But they embodied that sense of freedom and spirit of exploration.<br /><br />The strength of women in their society was impressive as well, and I think well portrayed in this series.
B000001FFJ|1.0|His most recent is better, where he's finally nailed the sound of what he's trying to do. This just sounds awkward. Rock fan myself, so I love when he's rasping blues, but not when he's goofing around in between. Try Real Gone instead.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I thought it was funny, charming, witty and just enough drama to balance it all out. I loved it. The acting was terrific and the story was great.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Excellent reading, well written , would certainly read another book but this author (who I never read before)Would certainly recommend
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Absolutely stunning.<br />This is without a doubt the best 3D 8 have ever seen. Combined with an interesting story line that has wide appeal makes this movie a winner. If you are looking for a reference video this is the one.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I love playing this game, it's fun easy to enjoy for past time away wonderful like it very addicted yes
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|A simple concept, but fun as you try to &#34;aim for the stars&#34;...but keep vigilant...up ahead trouble awaits. Have fun!
B005J6LKVI|1.0|The video was a Blu-ray. It can with both Blu-ray and DVD disks. Both disks were defective and would not play, I threw them away and rebought at WalMart. The reason I didn't return them is by the time I played them, I had thrown out the receipt and paper work to return them. The rest of the DVD's worked great.<br /><br />Thanks Pat Morrone
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Have been a Merlin fan from the beginning, having the complete 5th season before it aired in it's entirety on television is very nice.  Have already watched it twice since it arrived.<br />Thanks Amazon
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I read everything I can find by Francine Jay. My home of 30+ years runneth over and after my husband passed away, it fell to me to deal with it all. He was a \\"collector\\", hated change, and still had his Bass Weejuns from high school. Miss Minimalist helps me stay motivated and focused on moving it all out or on to new homes. And she does it by outlining a strategy, providing a few easy techniques...no making long lists, deadlines, projects. Her approach is an on-going process and a new way of looking at possessions.<br /><br />Less that 20% of the clutter is mine and I was horrified to discover how much emotion I'd invested in my own things. But perseverance and loving the new look of my home is carrying the day. I can now run a dust mop freely through a room and it's amazing how much calmer my mind is. I haven't achieved serenity yet and I will never be a person who only owns 50 things, but coming home and seeing open space and only things that I love has made all the hard work worthwhile.<br /><br />If the life you want to live seems to be buried under an insane amount of clutter, you could find no better place to look for answers than Miss Minimalist. She won't do the heavy lifting for you, but her philosophy and strategies can gently lead you to love the sight of a Salvation Army truck pulling away and taking another layer of anxiety off your mind.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Intelligent writing ...<br />maintains suspense--watch out for story twists.  Chapters go back and forth between his version and hers.  Diffucult to identify who protagonist and antagonist are til the end.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I absolutely love this series!!! Although sad to see an end to such a great story, I very much enjoyed the last book. It was one of those &#34;I can't put it down&#34; books. I encourage anyone wanting to have a GREAT series to read, start from book 1 and work your way through. You will not be disappointed!!!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This wasn't a typical James Bond film...kill the bad guys and get the girl.  The plot was much more interesting.  The action and special effects were great!
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The first half is well informed, useful, and well written. (4 stars.)<br />The second half is repetitious and not really about the power of habit. The illustrative stories (generally a great communication tool) seem endless. (2 stars.)<br />I believe the author gets some of the science and interpretation wrong. (2 stars.)<br />The Audible. com narrator reads the way bad teachers speak to second-graders. (2 stars.)
193700788X|1.0|A horrible ending to a series that i have loved all these years.badly written and terrible plot. Way to many useless characters running around but almost no time spent with the main characters..Save yourself some money and do not buy this book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|An interesting investigation with nice game play and graphics. This is one of the better games by big fish. A good buy for only $3.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Good movie. Perfect cast, good acting.  The kind of movie that I could add to my library.  Worth the time spent on it.
B002P79KAC|5.0|The writing is fabulous and the acting is out of this world good! It's hard to decide who my favorite actor is when they are all so good.
B00873GRU4|4.0|Can't wait to read the next book, would recommend reading Wool.<br />You really get into the story so it's hard to put the book down.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|I enjoy Zafon's work as well as his transllator's ability to construct excellent prose. Like all Zafon's other novels this is a great read.
193700788X|5.0|I had such high hopes for this book and I was thrilled with every single development. All of my questions were answered and my girl Sookie is a strong and wonderful woman. I'm going to read it again now :-)
B009NY43NY|1.0|I would remember the SVM characters as they should have been, rather than the mere shadows of themselves who appeared in DEA.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|You don't have to make a family movie groundbreaking to be enjoyable, which is why this movie succeeds. It places a unique spin on fabled characters, while sticking to bread and butter plot lines (such as: hero doesn't know what his purpose is, and discovers it while saving the day).
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book and i love it it is one of his best i think this is one of Jeff kinneys yet
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It doesn't have every old school game character, but it has plenty of them, and creates new characters that are just as fun. Should have won the Oscar over Brave (not for animation, but for quality of story...you don't have to have awesome red hair to be an awesome movie).
0316789720|5.0|I had expected a larger book, but it turned out it has many diagrams and you are never bored.  Excellent for someone who wants to begin learning the steps to drawing or for new ideas.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Avery good depiction of what must have been a horrific event.<br />Naomi Watts did a wonderful job. The children were magnificent.
B003L77GGK|5.0|excellent video  shipped as advertised and fulfilled with specifics as to the entire contents of the order placed love the show
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|great film of our forces and if one saw the interview of one in the film they used live rounds as in ac5tual training
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|While the storytelling here can be a bit choppy, the performances of all the actors here smoothes the turbulence greatly. Bradley Cooper delivers a really balanced performance. But from the moment Jennifer Lawrence hit the screen she steals your heart. She's incredible and it's not a surprise that she won the Oscar.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie. I felt like it didn't hide any of the dark secrets we as society usually keep secret. It was a very amusing movie. Def would buy!
B0086700CM|5.0|you get to do fun things on the the game should be the number one game in the year.loo you should love it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love the colors, the sound effects, the blasting -everything. No wonder it's such a popular game. It's addicting but luckily it limits your play with only a few &#34;lives&#34;  so you can't spend all day on it. Lots of fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are great. They are never blurry. This game is really fun although like other reviews said not many options for tournaments.
B0018NQ066|5.0|If you enjoy the music of Benjamin Britten, you will love this recording because not only does it have the complete Requiem, it has aural clips of B.B. talking to his chorus and orchestra and telling them just what he wants from them.  It gives insight and meaning to the thought processes of this great English composer and guides the listener as to what to listen for in the music.  This is especially helpful if you are a musician preparing this for a concert. If you plan to hear the piece live I suggest you listen to it before the performance and you will get more from your concert experience! It's a great piece.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love the game so much. I like how detailed it is. It just adds to your learning experience. The graphics are stunning. I like how you can attract new fish and have your all time favs from the movie stay in your reef.
B0098VXN2Y|5.0|I enjoyed the different scenarios provided and the daddy walking time. I'm pregnant now and some of it I could identify with.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This is a bad app. It doesn't have great graphics. It makes you wait through a lot of things during the game. Plus it takes forever to load when you first open the game. I do not reconmend this game for anyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome trilogy. Couldn't put it down once I started, as there was always some new twist on the next page.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Iron Man, Mr. Tony Stark, is full of charisma! Lots of action and a story line that holds your interest. I could watch this movie again and again.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Very easy to install, I love the fact that it has a zippered pocket were you can put some change, an ID....
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was my first Harlequin...but it won't be my last!  I really felt what the characters were feeling.  Really enjoyed it
B005HJWWW8|4.0|This product works as advertised but could use better instructions to operate.<br /><br />After much trial and error, I was finally able to get it to amplify my volume.
B00957T6X6|3.0|This is a easy way to kill a few hours, but the story isn't as good as what I was led to believe.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Am a fan of hers. The footage is real, raw and sheds some insight about the artist and her performance issues. It made me teary in some parts. You could see and feel her pain.
B008602KQI|4.0|I have not read the books but I thought the movie was very well done and I am now interested to see what happens next.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I love this cd am a fan of hers. I was fortunate to obtain this item and I have no complaints at all.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|it is one of the very few cds that i can listen to all of the songs over and over and over and over again!! LOVE IT!!
1616550414|5.0|I'm always skeptical of ordering anything from the internet but I was extremely happy to have seen the amazing condition of this book. Shrink-wrapped and boxed up in two boxes. Nothing was amiss about this book and my friend adored it. Greatest birthday you can give to an avid 18 year old Zelda fan.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I am 64 years old and remember when black people were treated so badly.  I especially loved the ending og the movie.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|This app is a waste of time. If u make a video and u do what u want when u watch it it goes to fast version and it won't let u watch it. I hate this app
B008M721MS|1.0|Did not install, Put in area code and phone number but asking for country code? Love this on my laptop will not install on kindle
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I am a single mom who is working my butt off and I didn't think Sandberg could possibly have anything to tell me.  I wanted to book to be bad- OF COURSE you can do it all when you make millions- but I ended up listening to what she had to say and learned a lot.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|This new, April 2013 CD is awesome.  We play ours in the car and love singing along with Darlene.  Wonderful lyrics and music that's pleasing to our senior ears, but fast enough to satisfy younger listeners.
B0091THRCU|2.0|Kind of complicated to pull it off. Black is ok but doesnt guarantee a nice look for this price. If u wanna save ur phone then buy it
1452115567|5.0|what a great dog I kind of wish my redbone could do some of these balancing tricks, but at 100 lbs I could not get him there, Love seeing how she does these &#34;on things&#34;
B005HED11Y|5.0|The same campy quality of the original series I grew up with, with somewhat modern special effects which so far don't take anything away from the episodes.  Worth the extra cost for the remastered version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|buy it buy it buy it.i loved it and hopeyou will to. get it get it. 5 star.but first learn how to play solitaire.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really liked this movie, the story was really good and the performances were worthy of awards and I don't even really like Bradley Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding. Great editing kept the story moving along,never boring or slow.
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality was a gift for son and I bought one for myself.We are planning on going to a Black Sabbath concert in Austin, Tx. next month.
193700788X|1.0|I'm thankful that I got my copy from the library to read and didn't waste good money on a boring and poorly written book.  I agree with so many other reviewers- the last few books haven't been that good, but nothing as shoddy as this.  I'd say don't waste your time, but maybe curiosity will have you read this.  This series was always \\"fluff\\", but it was fun fluff.  How this book got past her publisher is truly beyond me.  After the last couple of books, my expectations weren't that high, so I'm not too surprised that this was so abysmal.  Amazon needs to have a zero rating.<br /><br />To say that Charlaine Harris phoned this in is giving her too much credit.  More like she used two tin cans and a string to send it in.
B000059TEP|5.0|I saw Ghost the first time in 1991 one month before my husband passed away. This movie will always be special to me.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great movie! There is so much history brought out in this movie, that you need to see it more than once to get it all, as least I did. The actor were the best. DanielDay Louis was perfect, as Lincoln. All the others were wonderful,as well. Buy this movie! You will not be disappointed.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Well done overall. Thor is a character that would be a challenge to bring to the big screen. Great casting overall.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love it!<br />Awesome game! Play it all the time.........!!!!!!<br />My fav game right now. Played missile command as a kid this is better!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun and reliable. And easy to play. I recommend it to anyone. The cost is right on time
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Red was a vision of things to come, a predecessor to the sounds of the &#34;colours trilogy&#34; of &#34;Discipline, Beat, and Three of a Perfect Pair.&#34;
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I love this storyline and look forward to getting and watching the second season.  In this season Walter is a pushover for anyone.  Even his wife thinks that he is weak and she constantly wants him to open up and take charge of his life.  Walter has secretly taken over his life and it becomes evident that not even cancer will keep him down.  He loves his wife and son and will do whatever it takes to protect them.  He finds what he needs with Jesse, even if it means breaking bad.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. I have actually read all 3 books twice  I honestly could not put these books down. It took me a couple days to get through them. I love how it was written and I can follow the characters.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Again, I am hooked on the storyline.  I can't wait for the fourth season.  Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn are perfect together.  I like that Anna Gunn's character is beginning to find her words and wants to be more than a housewife, but a woman who knows she is more than just Walter's wife.  The son is interesting and is also finding his way.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Loved the character &#34;Donna&#34;.  She loved the adventure for the sake of adventure and had a wonderfully brash personality that allowed for some great character development in the Doctor's character.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I am hooked on this story.  I look forward to the third season.  I can relate to the cancer storyline.  I hope Walter makes it through his chemo.
0385349947|5.0|Ordered 5 copies and gave them  as gifts to my Women's Leadership Development group. Planing a book discussion  soon and I can hardly wait to hear the feedback from my team.
B002PMV9K6|1.0|I have all of Harry Potter movies and I had all but the half-blood prince in full screen. So I bought it but I didn't know that the SUB-TITLES ARE IN FRENCH, AND NO OTHER LANGUAGES. I DON'T READ FRENCH.
B006ISJQBM|4.0|Some work from a counter culture author of the times, I think I may have met him in the East Village in the 60's. I met alot of people during that period. And my memory of the 60's is filled with snippets, certain things I am sure of. And the culture of change in the world was alive in San Juan . I had an oppurtunity to go there around this time frame, but did not think I wanted to be confused as another American who where profiting off the people.<br />The main reason for the four stars, is for Mr. Deep bringing this story to the screen and DVD it shows a time period that was not covered in news media or film. Also Mr. Deep brings his sense of humor to make some of the ugly goings on a bit more palable.<br />I have yet to show this to people who have homes in San Juan and in the US as well. I will report on the reaction I get from that , I think Mr. Depp has done a service to all of the country by preserving a work of  art from obscurity, and giving future historians a detailed look at the cultural differences of that time.
B00AKFG15S|2.0|I love Jeffrey Archer and have been reading his books for years. When I saw this series I grabbed it. The Sins of the Fathers and especially Best Kept Secret were so busy that this reader was exhausted keeping up. I didn't have a chance to enjoy the character's success before another disaster loomed. There is a saying among writers that if you mention a gun on the mantle piece in the first chapter that gun must be fired by the end of the book. Seb learns about his sister and then...nothing!!!But most of all I felt let down by the ending. It was as if the writer wanted to quickly finish this book and grab the reader to buy the next one. An insult to the reader...sorry!
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|Been a fan on Boz since the 70's and this album kind of brings back that style of music. If anyone is a Boz Scaggs fan, don't be afraid of getting this album . You WILL enjoy it.
B009EHDU7U|2.0|This quirky tale could have been written by a schoolboy. The plot is quite unbelievable bordering on but not quite achieving fantasy. Its attempts at humour are almost achieved. The plot leaps all around the place like a Kangaroo with fleas. I have nearly finished the book and the only reason I am persisting is that I am curious to know how the writer winds it all up.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better.  I'm not sure what I will do when the kids grow up....hopefully, they will keep the jokes coming.
B005LAIISA|5.0|When you watch all the Ice Age movies fore the first to the fourth you will be amazed at how they make you feel.  The family aspect of them are what children and some adults need to learn.  They is bonding, forgiveness, love, and protection.  I would recommend this movie and the first, second, and third one.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|What a wonderful story that takes us back with story lines that are still relevant today.  I love Miss Austin and Emma Tompson is the perfect actor to keep her alive for modern viewers.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|The unusual family bonds together to help one who is lost, get teaching tool for all ages.  Your whole family will enjoy it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter loves to play this cute game, and even I'm hooked!  I love that you have to think long term goals, collecting coins and gems to save upnfor the next pony or shop.  Hopefully, my daughter will get the concept of delayed gratification.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. Spent ages playing it. Really addictive and many things to unlock I would highly recommend this game. SUBWAY SURFERS IS AWESOME
B002BWP49C|5.0|I loveeeeeee twilight... and am only left me the last one...breaking dawn part 2... here in my country i dont see that yet
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like how it stays in my drop down menu so it is ready to use and I can quickly check the temperature.  Easy to navigate and like the 5 day forecast is nice
034544678X|5.0|my girlfriend is an experienced dog trainer and as such she's always trying to learn more. This book in particular she never stopped trying to check out at the library she loved it so much. Now thankfully that i got it for my beloved, we can stop getting phone calls about the overdue book. Again great book and fantastic info, well worth the price, came really quickly and in beautiful condition.
B001AITGWE|4.0|This story is sad to me because I believe we all feel that way once in a while. We of course just dont do anything about it. Its like that saying that says, \\"If I said everything I was thinking, people would think Im crazy.\\" De-fens just had enough of the smart mouths people we encounter every now and then. His bad luck that he encountred them all in the same day!
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|I put the book down after a few chapters as reading about the sad lives of sad people is just not interesting.
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule historia is a book you must own to be a true zelda fan great explanation and well anything bout zelda
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am addicted to this game!! I play it every day! Its soo fun! I cant believe people came up with such an awesome idea for a game! Who ever made this game is genius!!!!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I bought a Kindle several years ago, and just like others reviewing this product, the insulation of my power cable has been cracking, leaving wires exposed. As others have suggested, I tried calling Amazon Customer Service to get the cable replaced at no charge.<br /><br />I have cables for other devices, such as my iPod, that are even older than this Kindle cable. Those cables are fine, no problem. It is the Amazon-supplied Kindle cable that is defective.<br /><br />The CS rep I talked to on the phone told me that they would NOT replace the cable. It would only be replaced if defective within 30 days of purchase. This is contrary to what other reviewers have said.<br /><br />I will have to go ahead and buy a new cable. I am not happy with the way the Customer Service rep handled my call.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The application was easy to download and able to watch at my convenience.  The movie was awesome.  I will download movies again.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I found this book to be one of the best I've read in a long time.  At the beginning, it's a bit difficult to tie the events together, but I kept reading.  Entering the middle, it became a fascinating psychological study of self, siblings and parents.  At the end, I couldn't put it down and was completely surprised by the ending.  Once finished, I wanted to immediately read it again to see if I could pick up clues along the way.  Intelligently written and thought provoking.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic as usual as President Lincoln. It was a great movie, however the story line of the son could have been better developed. But other than that the movie was really good depiction of our lovely American history.
B0081336FO|5.0|My only complaint is that the series is too short! Really well done show for those of us who like the original vision of Conan Doyle's character with a subtle modern twist.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Gives one a good inside look about what it is like to be delusional in one's belief system.  Our main character had a psychotic episode many years earlier that we vaguely understand happened during a problem with his marriage.  His only goal in life is to become a better person so his estranged wife will come back to him.  No matter what anyone says, what anyone does, Pat feels his life is a movie that will eventually take him to his silver lining life with Nikki.  It is often painful to see Pat's blindness to the fact he is dedicating himself to a purpose that is not going to happen.  Then enters Tiffany...<br /><br />Lots of humor in the book plus an outlook about Philadelphia Eagles' football culture and social questions like what one gets for 'being good'.  Definitely a good read.
B0063M22QO|1.0|I understood before buyng this that it was not like the Windows version, but I didn't realize it was so vastly different and frustrating. I have played hundreds of games, and can never get to the higher level (which I don't believe exists). If you try, you just get stuck in a loop. I haven't found a better one yet, but this is so bad I deleted it from my Kindle.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Great movie. This is Quentin Tarantino's new classic movie. Jamie Foxx was brilliant. Of course there was some gratuitous violence, but the story line was original.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I applaud Sir Jeffrey Archer for making me wait for the fourth volume! But I don't want to wait too long! Please continue the story as soon as possible. I am waiting........sigh!!!
193700788X|2.0|*spoilers*<br /><br />hmm...i discovered the SVM through true blood and went through them quickly, so it feels like i waited a long time for this last one to come out. and while true blood seems to be going in a kind of weird direction, at least it's a far more interesting direction than that which the books ended up taking. Dead Ever After just went out in a fizzle of apathy for me.<br /><br />I accept that this was the way the author originally intended to end the series. Sookie was always going on about loving the sun and tanning and wanting kids,and she was adamant throughout the entire series about never wanting to be a vampire herself, so obviously ending up with a vampire wouldn't have been the right fit for the lifestyle she wanted. and by the end of Deadlocked i had figured this would be how it would turn out, although i had hoped otherwise.<br /><br />I could have appreciated this ending had it been done well, although I liked both Eric and Bill far more. I'm not the author, so I don't have any say in how the story unfolds.<br /><br />But this was just sloppy and lazy, and as an author, you do have a responsibility to your readers to not be that.  There was absolutely NO chemistry written between Sookie and Sam, and Eric, the man she had been in a relationship with throughout the past however-many books appears maybe three times, briefly, in the entire novel? It was written as though this book would have been the end of the series much earlier on, but in that case, there should still have been some kind of emotional reaction in the reader aside from disappointment and apathy, especially if this was the great ending she apparently had intended it to be. There was never even anything at all between Sam and Sookie, ever, so I don't understand why the author expected her readers to be gung-ho and on board with this catastrophe.<br /><br />While I loved reading these books, they aren't exactly great literature, and the focus is on the relationships and romance.This book just felt like a horrible rehash of what came before with flat cameos of like every character ever, with a ridiculously sub-par ending. By the time I got to the weird \\"romantic\\" climax and had to read about them moving together \\"like seals\\" and talking monotonously and passionlessly about ending up together because they were fed up with excitement and they couldn't find anyone else better than each other, I was just like \\"no.\\"
B00992CF6W|1.0|It freezes all the time. It has froze 5 times on the tablet. It really stinks. Like really stinks. Really

0552163368|4.0|I'm about a third of the way into the book.  I love Pratchett's writing, his turn of phrase gets me laughing.  But the first part of the book lacks the action he usually has in his stories and is (forgive me) more feminine (touchy-feely) than usual.  He talks about dresses, for crying out loud.  ;&#62;)
1579126278|4.0|Bought this thinking I hadn't read this particular story. However, I have read it before - somewhere. Still, I had to read this again because it just drew me in as only Agatha Christie can. Such a clever plot and even though I knew the ending, it still had me thinking it had to be somebody else. CHRISTIE IS THE QUEEN OF MYSTERY!
B004SYP5WC|1.0|Just got this phone and app crashes.  Worked fine on my S3. Also backups are a joke. I exported a back up from the S3 and it won't load.
1451668945|4.0|I've been a MHC fan since she published her first book. I have noticed a downtrend in her story lines over the past 4 books. Maybe age, maybe boredom, but she has to get back to 'drawing the reader into the story'. Reading this was nice but not one I would read again. Such a shame a wonderfully talented writer has succumbed to the mediocre mind set that so many others (Patterson, Koontz, King, for example) have. King however, redeem himself with Dome!

B009NY43NY|1.0|Sookie Stackhouse has been abducted by aliens, and some whingeing fool has replaced her. That's what should've been in the blurb.<br /><br />According to many sources, Harris decided sometime around book nr. 2, who Sookie would end up with. While she herself states \\"I don't plan in advance\\" [...]<br /><br />Ah...you don't plan in advance, but you decided how it would all end 11 books ago. Nice to see you're consistent. I think the no planning statement is rather fitting, because no planning is certainly evident in this final installment. Half the plot threads are left hanging. The romance is lifeless. The most important charachters are suspiciously absent. All in all - this is a horrible read.<br /><br />I think I might just go back and start over, and never ever re-read books 9-13.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A great read interesting about the German side of things, also the combat sceens were great the best I have read,
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|After reading the book I had an image of what the characters should look like & the main characters in the movie were too good looking & too aggressive to bring the story to life the way the book did. Aside from that the quality of the movie was a little made-for-tv but still entertaining. I'm a little disappointed that I bought rather than renting though...because I will probably never watch it again.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Another excellent story. keep them coming! Stories with an US army theme are the best. We get an insight into army life..

B005PK553C|5.0|I'd highly recommend checking this out. This series, so far, (I'm only a few episodes in) is engaging and creepy on many levels, and for someone who's seen tons of the horror/drama genre, that's saying something. In short, it's takes a lot to get under my jaded, psychological skin and be pleasantly surprised by avoiding the usual clichés, including its clever blends of drama, suspense, mystery, romance, etc. It's also slickly edited without the camera work being intrusive or overly visually composed; moreover, as anyone in the industry would tell you, great film always starts with the script, including the right balance of the familiar with the unfamiliar, and again, this series, so far, has a solid foundation in this department. Topping it off is great casting, a nice blend again of the familiar and unfamiliar with characters we can actually believe in and care about. It's all about character ultimately, no? Hand in hand are the crew if stellar actors, all of whom, like Jessica Lange--certainly a standout, get the job done convincingly and with panache. It's nice when the acting is so polished, one forgets it's happening. Lastly, for someone with my schedule, it's impossible to find even a free hour most days to escape the real world for a few, so the short episodes please. What a pleasure to sit back in my lazy boy about midnight with my Kindle, some popcorn and whatever, and spin off the day's real world dramas with a nice dose of high quality, populist and happily, relatively mindless art. What remains to be seen is can this series sustain its promising start or will it go the way of say, the Walking Dead, becoming painfully watchable after a dozen or so episodes because the plot's all over the place and nowhere simultaneously, and one starts getting annoyed by the characters' acting tics? I hope not. So much can go wrong when one has to keep so many balls in the air, but again, so far, this series has been a surprisingly and pleasantly creepy rabbit hole. PS.A minor annoyance with almost all these current genre pieces are the tedious rip off opening credit sequences straight out of the cutting edge genre prototypes; I think the original was probably Fincher's \\"Seven\\", but these latest raw montage openings complete with ragged, frenetic soundtrack, have definitely lost their luster, seem forced and fake, almost comical, and thereby create the exact opposite effect they intend. Amazing by contrast, how, for example, Hitchcock's opening to Psycho, with Bernard Hermann's staccato violins still do the job all these years later, then again, genius is genius.

1607066017|5.0|SAGA is a great book that's well worth your time. Want to know why? Let's go.<br /><br />First, the writing. Brian K. Vaughn can tell an entertaining tale. If you've read his previous work in sequential storytelling, you know this. If you've watched the TV that he's written, you know this. Saga doesn't change the pattern. The basic setup is an ongoing war between two races, people with wings from a planet, and people with horns from its moon. In the middle of the conflict are two characters named Alana (wings) and Marko (horns) and despite the war between their races, they have fallen in love and Alana gives birth to their child in the opening panels of the story. Both factions want this kid real bad like, and Vaughn writes the protagonists struggle to survive with the dramatic punches in the gut that you want, and the laughs that you need.<br /><br />The art, then.  Fiona Staples does amazing work on this book! Her art style is realistic, but also has a kind of minimalism to it. She draws characters with convincing movements and affecting expressions that fit Brian K. Vaughn's writing perfectly. This is the first time I have seen any of Staples work, and boy does it impress.  Disclaimer though, this one is not for kids: There's some sex and some violence, think a rated R movie or a show on HBO, or a rated R movie on HBO.<br /><br />SAGA is a great book that's well worth your time. Now you know why. Go read it.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|There was a new twist to the story, with just as much action as the first Iron Man.  There was a little more romance.  I enjoyed this one as much as the first one.

It will  give you real purpose for being here, and info on the after life that you can actually check out for your self..  I have only read a few books in my life, but I have read all of his, and met his under studies and taken course more in depth.....  get of your butt, get the book, and read it, before doing anything else, then get on with your life.. and help someone else get and read that book...spread the word and get the truth out,  because they don't want you to know..

Although he is also a pastor, he does not bring in religion in this version of the book. It is very important to me that some things say secular. It was easy to read and understand. It has helped my husband and I understand how to make each other happy with everyday things. This purchase is to give the book as a gift to some friends.

B008RC72G8|1.0|I've enjoyed the original dark shadows series and the 91 remake.  Sadly this movie was a total disappointment as i knew it would be as soon as i saw Mr. Burton was involved with it.  The original series was not a comedy and Mr. Burton lost out on making a great horror movie with this story.  For all the people who like this movie that's great, for me i choose to forget this movie and enjoy watching the original stories.  I won't be adding this to my collection.

Can't wait for the next season.
193700788X|2.0|No Spoilers...<br /><br />I was a huge fan of this series almost from the start, but the writing in recent books has turned me off.  Trying not to be mean, but to be honest I think Ms Harris really wanted to be done with this series at least 4 books ago.  The tone changed (maybe due to True Blood?) and the writing got sloppy.  I honestly was done--it just hurt too much to keep reading a series I had so much emotional stake in when I felt like the author didn't care about the characters as much as I did.  That doesn't mean I don't think Ms Harris is talented, creative, etc. I just think she should have stopped a few years back when the passion died.  After the last book I was finished with the series and wasn't going to read (let alone buy) them anymore--then I heard that this was the last.<br /><br />Well...  Didn't work out so well.  The POVs were very odd--if I just hadn't wanted some closure I don't think I would have gotten past the first chapter.  The plot was nonsense.  The dialogue was ridiculous.  The humor and lightness were gone.  The characters completely changed--behaving in ways that make no sense.  While I have no problem with WHO Sookie ends up with, I have major problems with how they get there and the explanations behind it.  Not consistent.<br /><br />So why did I give it 2 stars instead of 1?  Because Ms Harris has created an imaginative world that used to be peopled with compelling characters and that just doesn't go away.  Because I do appreciate the dedication she wrote to the fans and because I do believe that THIS book (maybe not the last few though) was written selflessly to give her fans closure and I appreciate that.  As flattering as it is, it can't be easy as an author when you have the type of rabid, invested fans that I know this series has.  While I wish Ms Harris had ended the series awhile ago, I applaud her world building talent.<br /><br />Big fan?  Well, borrow it from the library--buy it if you must, but don't expect a lot.  Nota big fan?  Skip it and reread the early books.

B0045XGRQE|5.0|The movie is fun and interesting and does not disappoint. Great for families. Good story and entertaining characters. Keeps the plot moving forward.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching this show in season 3 on live TV, so took the opportunity to catch up on first two seasons.  I have been watching at least two episodes a day on my ipad to catch up.  I have not been disappointed!

0393338827|3.0|For Michael Lewis followers, this one does fit the bill of his other books - although as other reviewers have pointed out, Liars Poker is still his best book which I probably completed in 2 sittings.<br />Like his other books, this one is a page turner and explains a difficult concept (CDO's) etc with a panache that he is known far.
1400052181|4.0|Author Rebecca Skloot spent years researching this story, patiently gaining the trust of surviving family members, becoming friends with many of them and even becoming like family to at least one. She grew to care about the characters involved in her story, and wanted to bring some humanity to Henrietta and her descendants.<br /><br />While the tissue samples were used for private laboratory experimentation without Henrietta's knowledge, you get the feeling that if she'd known about it, she would have agreed to it. She was by all appearances a kind, generous, giving woman, and probably would have readily agreed to donating her tissue if she thought it could help anyone. But the way they were taken is indicative of the tmes. They didn't need permission to obtain or retain tissue or organs from you during surgery or procedures, if obtaining such wasn't harmful to the patient. And a time when there were rumors of white doctors kidnapping blacks on the streets around John Hopkins and doing research and experiments on them. This was not a totally preposterous idea, as doctors had been testing on black citizens for decades without their knowledge. With the way that the Lacks family was misled and even lied to, who can blame them for their mistrust of the medical and scientific community?<br /><br />Perhaps the most indelible character in the book, aside from Henrietta herself, is that of Henrietta's daughter Deborah, who is the toughest for Rebecca to win over, and yet their relationship grows to be the deepest and most significant. On a personal level, one of the things that I loved most about Deborah were her attempts to do what was best for her kids, and her desire to educate herself and to understand more of what happened to her mother's cells and what they meant to science and medicine.<br /><br />I loved the names of the family members that made up this story and I noted at one point \\"Who needs fiction with colorful characters like these?\\"<br /><br />My final word:This book brings to life a woman who died over 60 years ago, and tells Henrietta's story and that of her family with compassion and respect. The book is easy to follow, and isn't muddied with complicated scientific principles or language. The author is a layman, and she writes this story as a layman. This book is great for a controversial book club read, as there are so many ethical questions in regards to what the doctors did and how the scientific community has benefited from Henrietta's cells, while her family can't even get medical care.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. The plot has a lot of details and twists and that made it so enjoyable. It has nothing in common with Matt Damon's movie other than the names of the main characters so consider them as two different pieces of art.

B00BI6SSMC|2.0|Like any band changing direction, there will always be two sides: the one that accepts the new work and demands respect for it and the one that loses interest in the band significantly, but still cherishes the old material. And yeah, I'm part of the second group. I'm usually part of the first group, but when I do that I'm usually just forcing myself to like it, and that shouldn't be the case. Love shouldn't be contrived, and alas, if I pretended to like Sam Beam's new direction, I'd be a straight-up liar. I'm done lying about what music is good. This isn't good. This lacks the pieces of his old music that got me going. In all honesty, he should just retire the Iron & Wine moniker and call it something else. Reviewers are saying this is \\"poppy\\". Yeah, I guess? Still far from the garbage Top 40 bs, but I'll agree it's on par with the dreaded hip indie-pop with hardly any folk to make up for it. But even then, he doesn't follow the conventions of that categorization. I'd normally approve, but this hardly covers any good ground. Beam will always be a great lyricist, yet the over-produced background vocals along with horns and such kind of spoil any desire to reflect on my part. For those of you who \\"can't understand why anyone doesn't like this,\\" listen to \\"Our Endless Numbered Days\\" or \\"In the Reins\\". Eh, forget it. If you honestly can't see why the older-work fans and I are upset (give me a break, you know you SO can), then go on and just keep listening to this and probably the eventual Broadway production with Sam Beam break dancing between hits. It doesn't help that the \\"Ghost On Ghost\\" album cover looks like art from a hip downtown coffee shop, either. It's pseudo-sexual, confusing, and just vague enough to say that the two prior points are only if you interpret it superficially (ie, you're not cool enough to appreciate it).<br /><br />The only way to make up for this sub-par release is to reveal all those unreleased home recordings like \\"Beauty & Family\\" and \\"Two Hungry Blackbirds\\" with a proper release. Look them up on YouTube. He has over 30 secret songs that were leaked on the webs. And with that I'll conclude that any hopes I had for this album and any future album to revert to his old style are dead.Hungry Blackbirds\\" with a proper release. Look them up on YouTube.

B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I have the full version of this program for Windows and the app for Kindle Fire is very close to the full program and cost a tenth of the price.  I would like to work with the app a little more and see what I can create on it but I bought it for my daughter's Kindle and she won't hand it over ever.  She's created some cool work and it is a great intro program to expose a kid to digital art.  It's nice because it can create real art and isn't simple a toy for kids.  I do wish the stylus and tablet were more pressure sensitive but for $4.99 you can't go wrong.
B00008S7KC|2.0|The solution I found to the Region encoding nonsense is to use Windows Media Player. Not Media Center, not DVD software, but Media Player. I could not play this on my relatively new P'sonic blu ray 3D streaming machine nor on a friend's Sony DVD player. So, I can HDMI tether my laptop to the Phillips flat panel, and will also attempt to stream the show from laptop to TV via Wi Fi. This does not begin to address what the Director has done to the original film (still included on this release). An added note, you can change the region on some DVD players but typically only 5 times.<br />Happy sailing.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Really enjoyed this book kept me turning the pages, very good story, liked the way it ended too, you wanted it to keep going to find out what was going to happen next!!

B009NY43NY|3.0|This was not my favorite Sookie Stackhouse book but it was ok.  There were a couple of twists in the storyline that I liked and had not expected. My main disappointment was with Eric and since I do not want to spoil the book for anyone I won't elaborate.  Just Didn't Like The Whole Ending!<br />I really enjoyed reading most of the Sookie Stackhouse books and am sorry to see the series end, but in fairness the first few books in this series were the best in my opinion.  Just too many character inconsistencies.  Disappointing.  Read it Shaun had am lowering my rating...no where near the excitement and great storyline as the first several of the series.

B008NW67E0|5.0|my husband loves Mumford and Sons so I got this for him.  He plays it all the time and says it is a great cd.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|Good movie,very entertaing and easy to watch.the acting was good and the mother son relationship was touching.enjoyable comedy.Great movie for streisand,grogan fans.
B00BQI4AU6|3.0|I was so hoping to love this album.  Cinderella's \\"Long Cold Winter\\" got me hooked on blues, even if it was a heavy metal interpretation.  I'm sorry to say that the obvious use of special effects (autotune?) distracts from some of the songs and completely ruins others.  Keifer's voice has seen better days but blues isn't about having perfect pitch;  leave that for bubblegum Top 40.  This isn't a Cinderella album which suits me just fine but I felt cheated as it wasn't as bluesy as I wanted it to be.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's a doesn't have that much stuff but it's awesome.you get new updates. Im on 0.6.0 right now. It's worth 7.00
B00821OX98|3.0|The acting is pretty good, the story line pretty believable. When they fall into their religious mode, thanking God and praying, the acting becomes all contrived and stilted. The episode I watched last night bordered on the ridiculous. &#34;I'm grateful for...&#34;, Well, I thank God for...&#34;  It was like watching a kindergarten Thanksgiving play.  If they keep putting in the Catholic line I'll stop watching.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|In love with his writing style.  Enjoyed the book from cover to cover.  Recommended to all my friends.  Great, best book Ive read in a while.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Sweet Tooth isn't a typical McEwan novel. At least it bears little resemblance to Atonement, Saturday and On Chesil Beach. The storyline gets sidetracked during the journey - I'm pretty sure there was a more interesting route to take - but as usual McEwan's prose saves the day.
0763644765|5.0|Love this simplistic, fun book.  It's silly and puts a smile on my little guy's face.  And it's simple enough that you can enjoy adding your own storylines, further making you kid laugh -- anything to make potty training a positive experience!
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's a good game but would be a lot better if you don't expect people to use real money on the game. ITS A GAME, no real reward in it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The thought that I even have to wait WHO KNOWS how long for the third book is driving me insane. I love this series. It turned out to be nothing of what I expected. You read the first and then your like \\"Oh, okay. This will be smooth sailing.\\" But no! Ups and downs, and 'wtf?!' moments. Too many times I had to set the book down and process what I just read. It was amazing. I lingered on the last chapter for a week, simply because I couldn't wrap my mind around the idea that I was almost done. I can't wait for the next book!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It was a good book.  Easy and quick to read.  I'm excited to see the movie as it probably offers some insight.
B001HC8516|5.0|So, I read this book a few months ago when me and my guy were going through issues, and I read it again after I just left him. (My next move is, \\"It's Called A Breakup Because It's Broken\\")<br /><br />I love how straightforward the book is but at the same time works to make you feel better about yourself... YOU are worth more. It really slapped me in the face a few times and I even found myself crying because we all know that when we go through a breakup, we are pretty much in denial. It was good to have the girl/guy perspective too. I was planning on marrying this guy so I still find myself re-reading some pages to keep stay sane. Like I said, every girl needs this book!
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Willie still has a great voice and his renditions of old and new classics can't be beat.  This is an album one can listen to again and again.
193700788X|3.0|I am happy who she ended up with, but I think a lot of the readers are upset with the way this book was written. It felt like Charlaine Harris didn't pour her heart into the book like the others. It felt like she just wrote the book to be done with the series. I was left mostly just feeling disappointed. Her other books I could barely stop reading, only my &#34;about to burst bladder&#34; tore me away from them. Well, you can read it yourself or save yourself a lot of heartache if you just read the spoilers about who she ended up with.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The final book of the Sookie Stackhouse novel series wasn't what I expected and I appreciate that. Frankly, it's hard for authors to surprise me. In this case, it what surprised me most was that the series ended pretty much the way I thought they should from the very beginning.<br /><br />I began reading this series long before most, at least it seems that way. I started reading when book 2, LIVING DEAD IN DALLAS was still new, before True Blood was even a glimmer in HBO's line-up. Over the intervening years, I've watched the characters and stories change and not always for the better. In DEAD EVER AFTER I feel like Harris is actually bringing the story back to where she intended it to be, which is why I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />To be fair, this isn't my favorite book of the series. I didn't like the bouncing point of view or the fact that so much of it felt forced and extraneous. The mystery was also light. In fact, it was almost non-existent. Harris, in my opinion, would have been better of sticking to what she does well and NOT trying to justify what happens to a fan base that was probably not going to be happy unless they got the ending they wanted. Which, if they'd paid attention from the beginning, they would have known wasn't in the cards. In other words, if you're a card-carrying member of Team Eric or Team Bill  or a die-hard truebie, you're going to hate this book. If, on the other hand, you are a fan of Harris and recognize she isn't writing romance novels, then this is worth the read.<br /><br />DEAD EVER AFTER is a very fast and light read, great for travel or a day by the pool. If you haven't read any other books in the series, this isn't one to start with and, unfortunately, you probably need to read the preceding book as well to really make sense of it. That said if you only made it to book 9 you'll probably be ok jumping to this book. Is it great? No. But I am glad I read it.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Heeeee's Baaaaaack!!!  And better than ever!  I've been a Rod Stewart fan forever.  His was one of the first concerts I ever attended.  I have just about every album he ever made including all the \\"Great American Songbooks.\\"  I almost didn't buy this one because I thought it was just another attempt for a somewhat aging artist to stay afloat.  (Sorry,Rod.)  But boy, was I ever wrong!  When I saw that it was all new songs, I thought I would give it a try.  Every song on this CD is fantastic.  My favorites are \\"It's Over\\" and \\"Pure Love.\\"  (This one made me cry!) I love the ballads and the more upbeat selections are \\"Pure Rod.\\"  I can't wait to play it for my husband who is also a Rod fan from way back.  I highly recommend this CD.  I love, love, love it!!!  Thanks Rod!
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun game and addictive. I used to play this game online all the time. it'd be nice if you could link facebook to this
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have been a loyal fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series and each May the highlight of my year I eagerly await her new book. Always buying it the day it comes out and reading it non-stop until it is finished. I saw the writing on the wall that she was going to end up with Sam, and although I was disappointed I was curious how CH was going to work this all of a sudden \\"great love\\" in. Well thank you for throwing your fans under the bus CH I will never purchase or even read another book you write - you are a hack who has destroyed your own work and characters for what reason?? (anger over True Blood or Ball)?? Not good enough - I pray that True Blood does Eric more justice and not get hung up on Bill who it seems they are favoring. Your fans loved Eric and you destroyed him!!! PS you have some nerve trying to write a follow up - I hope no one buys it
193700788X|1.0|There is so much wrong with this booki don't even know where to start. I have read all the prev books and for the life if me can't believe that some one who she mentions in SEVERAL books that they mean nothing to her but a friend that she goes out of her way to NOT read his mind manages to be her HEA! These last two books were really a disappointment to me and I wish I hadn't spent money on them or even read them. Did CH even write this crap? There are so many inconsistencies that my head spun like I was auditioning for The Exorcist. What happened to 'no your stuck with you telepathy' or 'reading shifter or weres is harder than humans but I can still hear them.' I call BS, this book had no fire, the wit was MIA and the sex scene was just down right BORING! As far as I'm concerned these last two books don't belong with this series. Sookie, Eric and Sam all had personality replacements and acted like they were characters in a REALLY bad fanfic written by a ten year old. Instead of fighting Eric just went out on a whimper, Sookie was all 'the CD could be affecting us but oh well I guess that's ok' when the blood bond with Eric was such a huge problem for her that she had her witchy friend sever it just to see if she really loved Eric or not and Sam was so out of it that I almost wondered how good the drugs he was on really were, he acted like a freaking pod person for about half the book.  The only person who acted remotely like the character I had come to love was Pam. Save you money read a fan-fiction. If I could I'd put 0 stars i would but that's not an option.
0425252868|5.0|To me this was a wonderfully different book on World War II.  I tells a good story of the two pilots from  each of their points of view. It told about their triumphs and tragedies as the war progresses and how both their lives changed that day.  A few days after I finished the book I stumbled across a video of that first meeting between the two pilots and it meant a lot to actually see the two of them talking just as described in the book.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|Is an art or science of filming motion pictures however its much more science when your trying for 3-D. 3-D's pupose is to bring the veiwer into another reality. This means the fore ground and background are in focus and you do not see stationary objects move unless thats the fantasy or veiw every thing thru muchas. You expect some ghosting during the action because the skill or technogy is not there yet but double image rocks is just bad. Captain America worked because art deco lighting gives off glare , creates shadows , and there is alot of dust in war so you could over look bad cinematography. It is a period piece and the old rules of film do not work for 3-D. Subtitles are just plain stupid for example because the only floating words that work are Si - Fi sign'age. I saw nothing wrong with the writing or acting in this film but I paid for 3-D and did not get it in The Avengers .Fact is the bad is in the sandard Blu-Ray too and only the DVD played on a up verted unit worked. I would get that for cheap instead and ask Marvel to hire someone who understands 3-D on the next try. I know they can do better because Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance was and others are doing stuff years ahead of Marvel.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Show is great! Highly recommend Downton Abbey to anyone looking for a new show to watch. Quality of Amazon streaming is high too.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Love it! Just needs more levels, with more complicated levels,  with some easy. Would love to see some bridges also.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I literally just finished the book. I was so excited to see what the future held for our beloved Sookie. But in the end, we still didn't really know. We know who she kind of ended up with, but was it happy ever after? Or even a real relationship? We just don't know. You can't be surprised who it is, I called it a few books back. No one else made sense. Sookie always insisted she would never be a vamp, she wanted kids and loved sunlight too much. She was never willing to give that up. So short of introducing a new character, you can figure out who it is. Especially after the last book. I didn't really like how her relationship with Eric ended, it was her longest and most passionate one. The book also was like a parade of past characters, passing through to remind you that they were there at one point. While I loved some of them (Quinn, Alcide) they didn't do anything for the story. Mrs. Harris has always said she knew who she wanted Sookie to be with, since the beginning, so you can't fault her for following her vision for her character. It just felt kind of rushed, and not really fleshed out.
B001NTJV6G|5.0|Great CD loved this CD in college. Brings back memories. Durin erykah is a great artist. 1996 was a great year in music. The price is great for it.  Thank you so much
B00290FWYS|5.0|while some of the latter entries in the cafe del mar series are so-so, this double album has some great songs and harkens back to the first 5-6 albums in the series. hearing it takes me back to ibiza and watching the sunset over formentera from this place....
B0097K21YW|4.0|First, I don't understand why this game needs network permission since there's no IAP or high scoring leader boards in the version I'm playing?<br />Instructions on the scoring structure and each dinosaurs upgrade abilities would have been nice, maybe in a future update they could add this.<br />This is far from any Angry Birds clone, it's a good spin on catapult games.<br />The game is easier to play on a larger screen, I played it on a sgs2 skyrocket running 2.3.6 and a Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 running 4.1.1, on the phone it was hard to see all of the target objects on some levels and with the tablet most levels were all viewable.<br /><br />The game does have some physics issues, but it's not a deal breaker.<br />The aiming rectile isn't accurate, but does provide a reference point for follow up shots.<br />Your objective is to score high enough on each level to achieve a gold medal to earn bucks to buy a dinosaur upgrade which costs 500 bucks for the 3 available to buy.<br />Gold = 15 bucks<br />Silver = 5 bucks<br />Bronze = 2 bucks<br /><br />Chapter 1 has 45 levels<br />Chapter 2 has 45 levels<br />Chapter 3 has 10 puzzle levels<br />Chapter 4 has 4 battle levels<br /><br />The game tells you the score you need to reach the next medal after each level if you don't achieve the gold medal.<br />You have unlimited shots, so as stuff burns shoot it multiple times to destroy it faster. The faster you burn it all down the more time finished points you earn. As you play the game you'll figure out the important things to shoot first to obtain higher scores. I don't won't to spoil the challenges of the game here so I'm not explaining it.<br /><br />The game is fun and challenging and the $1.99 price point is okay because there's no ads and 104 levels. Some may say it should be $0.99, but these days you get IAP and please rate the app ads in games costing alot more money which is extremely annoying.<br />I would buy this game if it wasn't FAOTD.<br />It's a solid 4 star game,but needs some physics tweaks and more variety in the levels structure to be 5 stars.
193700788X|2.0|I own and have read every book several times, but I have to admit of being disappointed with this last book.  I know why the book ended the way it did; Sookie needs stability.  I loved how all main characters were brought back and tried to help Sookie.  They all had an ending to their story line with Sookie, but Eric.  Eric and Sookie’s relationship was weaved through out all of the books; to suddenly end with such a cold ending was not nice.  Eric was built up to be such a strong, fearless vampire sheriff that nobody wanted to go against; to have him forced into marriage and be sooooo spineless was a shame.  Eric was hardly in this book and when he was he had maybe two or three lines.  Why??  Sookie and Eric had an important relationship; where she loved him until she hooked up with Sam.  There was no ending for Eric; he was quietly whisked away into marriage without a scheme or fight.  That’s not the true Eric Charlaine had built up throughout her books.  Where did he go??  It was like the book was forced into a happy ending for Sookie, but you were left still pondering at the end.  I felt like that the vampires story lines were left to the curve and treated like they were no longer important to the books or Sookie.  How can that be when all the books had Sookie’s life intertwined with vampires?  Save your money; the ending was too sappy and forced to be happy.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time over 30 years after it was released.  Films about war tend to age well and this movie feels like it could have been released this year.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I saw the Redux version first because I thought the director's cut after all this time would be better.  I thought Coppola could reflect on the film and release an improved version with the extra footage.  This was not the case.  While I really liked Redux, I absolutely loved the original version.  I think it's a shame that Redux destroyed the pacing of the original.<br /><br />I don't think Redux is worth your time.  Some people will say you should watch both or treat them as independent movies.  I found that the parts that I liked in Redux were from the original version and the parts that I didn't like were only in Redux.  Why bother?  I suggest spending 2 hours watching a different movie.  If you haven't seen Coppola's The Conversation or of course The Godfather series, I suggest watching those instead of Redux.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It was okay, but not something I will play all the time. I actually uninstalled it from my device after playing it a few times. FB gave me trouble loading it.
1608871088|5.0|Art...pure art is what this book is all about! Inspiring images of the different characters reflect expertise in crafting the colors and textures that enhance the design of the subject. The Sandman -- one of the most favorite -- undergoes great study turning him from ancient to lovable! Get this book if you love the animation of the movie. Dreamworks is really about great dreams in art too!
B005LAIHZY|1.0|Brave and tangled, are both two of the worst disney films ive seen lately, i HATE the pixar like artwork, if i wanted to see that id watch pixar. when i choose an actual disney i want the old school artwork, dont tell me they dont animate that way anymore, because The Frog Princess was wonderful, funny and great artwork.<br /><br />Brave was boring, the main character was repulsive to look at as well as many of the characters, it was too hyped up i was already sick of it before i watched it. if they had tried their traditional animation i may have liked it better, but honestly Brave was just wasted money in my opinion<br /><br />and im a huge disney fan

1586210912|4.0|Book gave me some new ideas and perspectives.  I do not believe for a second that the examples of things that have happened in his life are literally true- lots of literary license pushed to the limit here.  Good points are made none the less.  However as someone with a progressive point of vie in life the fact that the author dismisses &#34;workers&#34; who do not share his entrepenurial drive and skill as deserving of their fate as poor exposes one of the fatal flaws o capitalism.

B000MSU28U|5.0|I've used bumper care for all of my cars exterior plastics. I helps protect it from the suns harmful UV rays and restores it to that prestine look when you first purchased it. I would recommend buying Autoglym Back-to-black spray can with this and then use this product as a reconditioner. It lasts through washes compare to other brands. The bottle is small (used to be able to get purchased at 1 L bottles). It costs a lot but if you want the best, i highly consider this product!
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Why the 2 stars if it's one of the worst movies I've seen? Good question, and I'll tell you that there were two redeeming qualities:<br /><br />1. Meryl Streep's acting is beyond fantastic (as usual) and the make-up is pretty amazing, too.<br />2. You get a brush-up on British history, by watching this film, which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Other than that, it is poorly directed, extremely slow, very choppy, un-entertaining and I also started to fall asleep, which rarely happens when I watch a movie (I know this is standard for some people, so I wanted to clarify.) ;)<br /><br />Honestly, there are so many movies to choose from: use 2 hours that you would waste on this one, and watch a different one. Or better yet, catch up on an extra 2 hours of sleep (most Americans are sleep deprived.) I wish I would have been in bed instead of watching this disaster of a film.

1476733953|3.0|If you're like me, odds are that you are debating purchasing Wool because of all of the hype. Makes sense, right? Here's a guy that's not only managed to beat the odds of self-publishing by writing something that has sold insanely well, but he's landed a movie deal and managed to retain his e-book rights. The great self-publishing dream. I just have to give you a little bit of a warning before you rush out to buy that paperback copy or download the ebook versions: this series will probably only be truly appreciated by a core set of people. The rest of us might like it well enough or recognize its appeal for others, but still shrug and wonder what all the fuss is about. The only advice I can give so far is that if you're going to buy this rather than get it from the library, go for the omnibus. You can't really judge this on the first book alone. I didn't really have a set decision about it until book 4.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this series for the above reasons, but for various reasons I felt my attention continuously wandering. There are some pretty big flaws to the scenario, some of which I could overlook while others kept bugging me. One of the first and most immediate things that bugged me was that you have a silo full of people that have little to no reaction to the yearly Cleanings that occur. (This is where one or more people are sent out to wipe off the lenses of the cameras that show the surrounding ruined landscape, and it's somewhat unclearly stated that even if they do survive it, that this is a banishing and that they really aren't encouraged to return.)  I can understand to a degree that some societies will adapt to horrible things such as a Cleaning, but I didn't really feel that Silo 18's people really felt like the type that would put up with such things. You can argue that this is because they aren't, which explains some things later in the book, but that's sort of a weak excuse because this went beyond being a society on the brink of rebellion and was more of a general thing.<br /><br />There were also some inconsistencies between the initial short story and the rest of the series. I can understand this to a degree since I got the impression that the first story was meant to be a stand alone, but I wish that this had been fixed or addressed when Howey started planning to write the longer series. There are more than a few weak spots to the series as a whole that sort of irked me, although I might have noticed them more because I didn't entirely enjoy this book and it was insanely slow to start off with. I almost stopped reading about halfway through the book, all because I just kept waiting for something to happen. It doesn't help that this book can't quite decide which genre or reading group it's aimed towards. It's sort of billed as a dystopian sci-fi read, yet it focuses more on political power struggles and daily life sort of scenarios. The dystopian setting does somewhat play into the series more as the book progresses, but it's not as strong as I'd wanted it to be nor exactly the type I was expecting. The target reader group is a little harder to nail down, as the character ages and premise sound like it's targeted at adults while the text reads like it's more for a YA group.<br /><br />All harshness aside, I can't deny that there is a definite appeal to this book. Once it got past its slow stage (the first half of the book), this did become more interesting and it was easier for me to want to keep reading. While I did complain about some of the problems I perceived with the book, it's not like Howey is a terrible writer by any stretch and I'd go so far as to say that he's better than some of the mainstream authors I've read in various genres. I just feel that he could have done a better job of it all and of merging the series as a whole together. It's the type of book that will launch a career but will be very mildly embarrassing later on once the author gets more experienced as far as his writing style goes. You can definitely see this progress through the books, where Howey starts becoming more familiar with his characters and more comfortable in a set writing style. I hope it doesn't come across too negatively when I say that I wouldn't mind seeing this re-written later on once he's completed everything and can work out all of the kinks in the series.<br /><br />In the end I think that if I'd been more of a fan of this specific type of read (wandering genres, dystopian sci-fi that is set in one firm location with little exploration into what lies beyond- so far), I'd probably have liked this more. As it is, I can't really hate this either or really muster up any true displeasure to give it less than three stars. Once it picked up its full steam at the end, I'll admit that it turned into a bit of the page turner I so desperately wanted it to be for me. I'd recommend this for die-hard fans of dystopian sci-fi books, but I'm not entirely sure that I'll be purchasing the next book in the series. I'm mildly curious to the point where I might get it from the library when the next omnibus releases, but buy it? Nah. I'll leave the copy on the shelf to be snatched up by someone more eager. For all of my quibbles, I doubt that Howey will be lacking fans anytime soon.iting style goes.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|At the beginning of \\"Iron Man 3\\", millionaire inventor Tony Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. As Iron Man, he nearly died defending the earth from an invasion of aliens in \\"The Avengers.\\" Now he can't sleep. He tinkers endlessly with his latest Iron Man suit while his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts slips away. He makes the big mistake of directly challenging a mysterious terrorist named the Mandarin, and includes his home address. And then his one-night stand from 1999 shows up at his front door with important news...<br /><br />\\"Iron Man 3\\" has lots of great action scenes and good special effects. Oddly enough, Tony Stark spends much of the movie out of his Iron Man suit. He has to rely on his brains and his bravado to track down the Mandarin. Along the way, Pepper is kidnapped by the bad guys. In a dramatic finale, Tony and best buddy Rhodey Rhodes must choose between saving Pepper and saving the President.<br /><br />Tony Stark spends much of the movie contemplating his relationship with his Iron Man persona. At movie's end, he makes some drastic decisions about that persona. The ending leaves some interesting questions about how Iron Man will be played in the next Avengers movie.  Recommended.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There may have been artistic liberties taken in the retelling of this historic series of events, but it was very exciting to watch and I highly recommend it!
1934356557|3.0|I found the book to be fairly basic. If you're a seasoned sql user you won't find much insight. Several of the antipatterns/solutions were contradictory.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I'd never heard about the orphan trains.  The book pulled me into a world that was heart breaking and uplifting too.  My dad was orphaned at age 12 with 4 other siblings.  No one wanted them but my great grandmother at age 76 took them in and they all grew up to be wonderful human beings.  I used to love to hear daddy tell stories about Grandmother.  She was strict but raised all of them with lots of love.<br /><br />I plan on researching more about orphan trains ... Thanks Ms. Kline!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I wasn't sure if this would improve my photos.  It does!  To be able to bounce the light, even in the daylight, makes skin tones seem so much more attractive.  Price is right too.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|This was a very fun book to read.  Chris Pavone captured my interest early on in this novel and kept my interest until the end.  The Expats follows the story of Kate Moore, who is a former CIA employee.  She quits her job to move to Luxembourg after her husband accepts a job there.  Things go well at first for the Moores, but then their past comes back to haunt them.  There are many twist and turns in this thriller that keep the reader guessing about how the story will turn out.  I am not sure how I felt about the ending, but it was a very entertaining read.  The novel alternates between the past and present, as both stories unfold simultaneously.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that like spy or crime thrillers.  I can't wait to read Pavone's next book!
B000XILXO6|5.0|I love this series, love the theme, story lines.....and I Love the Winchester Boys!  Grown men now-8 seasons strong and hopefully still counting.  I have seen most of the episodes 3 or more times-all but this one.  It is one my favorites (really all of them are my favorites but this is my one of my favorite favorites)and I had only seen it once.  The looks on their faces, the slapstick pratfalls, the impossible ricochets--all classic!  It is now on my Kindle-forever.  Nuff Said.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Although the film story diverges a little from the actual book, one can easily see (if one is a Tolkien devotee) why the divergences are included and how they fit so well.  Radagast is a brilliant character (he simply doesn't play a major part in the book) but he assists in creating the escape sequence that is necessary for the whole party to reach Rivendell.  Gollum's depiction is brilliant, and I was extremely pleased to see the small sequence in which Bilbo spares his life......it has far reaching consequences that only come to full fruition in the Lord of the Rings.  The eagle sequence is also cleverly done, even though it is not &#34;book accurate&#34;.  However, it cuts out a section of the book that has little place in the film and leaves the party at the appropriate point where they can then move towards Beorn's house.  While the Necromancer is only referred to obliquely in The Hobbit book, it is obvious that it is Sauron who is trying to rebuild his body and the advent of the sorceror King of Angmar is an equally important prelude to the Lord of the Rings.  It was clever to put the council meeting at Rivendell......this gets the main players into the action and ready for the next part in the last section where the White Council forces Sauron out of Dol Guldur.  This is well worth seeing.

B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|You gotta be kidding! I love this man and all the songs he sings. I love my BASED ON A TRUE STORY CD. I listen to it at work and at home. Can't get that &#34;Red, Red, Red' song out of my head....
0307352153|5.0|Very enlightening. I recommend this to anyone who is an introvert or loves an introvert. It is well written and easy to read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I read this book in one weekend, I loved the depth of the characters and the historical references. A great book to get lost in.
B004J64QSI|4.0|It was very good but not terrific. I will probably not watch it again for a long time. I especially enjoyed the four stars at the end.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Great puzzler that you'll return to time and time again. Starts off  easy then gets progressively harder. Brought on kindle app of the day not sure if I'd want to pay full price though.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, well paced. Hard but not impossible. A thinking persons game, looking forward to more from in this genre.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina applies her distinct style of humor to personal styles and anecdotes. Gives great behind the scenes tales about SNL and 30 Rock.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Got hooked after a friend recommended I start watching the current episodes.  I had to go back to season 1 and I am hooked and couldn't be happier.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The rotation is a little stiff, and sometimes the magnets don't seem to want to turn off the device. Other than that, I got the orange (love it), and the indentations are deep enough that the Kindle catches and holds firmly in them. It's a very nice stand for both portrait and landscape orientation. It's also nicely padded and sturdy.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love RPG game sirtely this one its hard and easy at the same time I love hard RPG game and this one is epic
B009NY43NY|4.0|Anyone who read the last couple of books should know where this one was headed. Sookie has aged and matured and, as we all learn eventually, has stopped going for the bad boy. This ending is how it should be.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|This movie is great to watch with family, because apparently, it's about a boy who is stuck with a tiger in a boat after a shipwreck. In the end, one understands what really happened to the boy, and it's horrible to think about. But this last part went way over my kids' head, so it was OK to watch with them. A very clever story, magistrally executed by the movie director.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I guess I need to buy another tablet for the girls, all my kids luv this game, they cant put it down.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|We watched this movie as a family. I think it's better to watch this movie with teenagers. The whole story has a very gloomy mood, shows the harsh reality of drug and alcohol addictions, but in the very end, the main character redeems himself a little, showing that people may still be decent and do the right thing in a given situation.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Who doesn't love blowing those things up?  I have this on  my smart phone, my boss too. Those crazy birds.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|We love this movie! We watched it twice at the cinema, and have rented it several times. We just can't get enough.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|Maybe my son needs to play around with it more, but he lost interest in it!  Glad it was free.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Tony's story.  And it should be &#34;required&#34; reading for all businesses.  The focus on &#34;doing the right thing&#34; and creating a true corporate culture that does good for everything is great.  Far too many businesses focus on short term profit at the expense of their employees.  But Zappos &#34;walks the walk&#34;.
B005IQZB14|4.0|REALLY ENJOYED THIS ADVENTURE OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS DETERMINED TO LET GO OF HER PREVIOUS LIFE AND TO FIND HAPPINESS.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Crime thriller fans are in for a real treat with \\"Time Killer.\\" Its story revolves around a detective and his new partner who find themselves up against a terrifying enemy who has taken his vendetta against time wasters to a brutal new level.<br /><br />Wasting this killer's time will first get you tortured and then mercilessly killed. For Max and his new partner, Jesse, it's a race against the clock to stop the murderer for he isn't intent on slowing down any time soon.<br /><br />A bloody and unrelenting fast-paced plot, mixed with mystery and twists will keep you glued to the edge of your seat from start to finish. Fans of James Patterson's crime thriller series \\"Alex Cross\\" will find an instant appeal with \\"Time Killer,\\" and constantly left guessing to just what will happen next. Todd Thiede is definitely an author to watch. Hopefully there is a sequel to look forward to in the future.
B008NF45S2|4.0|I now only require evaluating the Windows client for achieving proper printing to High Resolution paper. Since the client will utilize the Windows device driver itself I anticipate an appropriate result.
B00006CXSS|5.0|With the public school system largely ignoring WWII, this is an excellent depiction of why we fought and what it meant to those who fought it. it details how these American boys one minute became the men we all grew to honor and respect. This is a must see for all.

B003YV0A02|5.0|This is still one of the best movies ever.  Modern action flicks are crap in comparison.  Bruce Willis will always Rule.
0679805273|5.0|Hardcover of an old favorite! Perfect for grads or kids. This is a classic Dr. Seuss story, and illustrations. Recommend!
B009IF82SK|5.0|I love the writing on this show but Sheldon is the star!  Nerds will live forever and always get the girls!
B000PDYVVG|4.0|Loved this book, for the second time. It's a great read for gals trying to figure 'it's out. I loved it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the great stories you dive deep into, and will miss when its finished. Unexpected ending, but tied up nicely.
B00BMQDM10|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, I burst out laughing on more than one occasion when reading it. However, while it was a pleasant and light hearted read, it doesn't have that un-putdownable quality that some of Sophie's other titles have. In the end I skimmed through the last little bit of the book and skipped to the end to see what would happen (though I needn't have bothered, I predicted it anyway). Still, I can't bring myself to give it anything less than 4 stars. Any Sophie Kinsella fan shouldn't hesitate to purchase it.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|First time I watched the show I really liked it, but never watched the second episode. Came back later in the right mood to watch serious drama and was definitely glad I did. This show is a must watch. Dialogue is superb. Characters are good too. Very fun to watch, actors are fantastic! Love Maggie Smith, she is awesome.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I read a lot of reviews saying how the ending ruined the entire trilogy for them, but I highly disagree. This last novel developed all the characters in a much more intricate way then the last 2 books, and the story steered somewhat away from just the subject of love and dove into something much deeper. It focused on virtues as a whole as opposed to just happenings within individual relationships. The ending felt right to me. More like real life and less like a fictional childish fantasy.  2 thumbs up!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|The seventh, and final, season of this Star Trek series was probably the absolute best season of the series. The characters were fully fleshed out during this last season. The dangling strings from several plot lines and even the movies were wrapped up well, and the series finale hasn't been beaten by any of the other Star Trek franchise's other series.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This was such a beautiful visual experience.  The story kept us at the edge of our seats.  I highly recommend it!!
B00178JDCK|3.0|For the price feature it is a winner, it ability to mix with the incoming signal is a bit off, how ever like most effects, it has it's<br />sweet spots that can make sounds others like it cant , this is a good effect.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|Loads of content for a low price. It is a must buy for Final Fantasy fans, I absolutely recommend it.
B0096C7QF0|4.0|This cd set has a lot of idea's in it. you can hear Eric Johnson's influence in tone, as well as classic R&B, the guys got a lot of energy,
B00CK8CKP8|5.0|Told from the point of view of a young Nigerian girl, this story reveals in a most chilling way the harm that missionaries with their proselytizing and religions zeal bring to a culture that was doing just fine without them. What incredibly misguided individuals they are and the havoc they wreak is far reaching. This is religion at its worst.<br /><br />The beauty of this novel is in the young heroine, Kambili's, ability to survive and love despite the world she is forced to live in.<br /><br />There are hints only of what religion did to warp her father into the abusive husband and father that he is. Some of the story is hard to believe, but I suspect it is all too true. When I lived in Mali, friends were deathly afraid of horses. They explained that when they were very young, priests enjoyed Sunday afternoon games of chasing them down on horseback. What is it in religion that can warp a \\"god loving\\" man into a monster?
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I love this case and the shipping was super fast.  I never have to worry about my kindle.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the hard plastic on the case is peeling a bit on one of the corners.  You can hardly tell and it doesn't bother me.  For all I know it happened one of the tomes I dropped it.  Yes, I've dropped it.  this case does its job well and the screen flap keeps the screen clean.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game. Except for the losing coins and credits. Ive lost 20 credits at a time. But it is a good game. Fun and entertaining
B00BF11STU|1.0|(SPOILERS) I've been psychologically tortured/harassed for years by the anti-terrorist section of our government (or I believe that's who it is) as I spoke out against the Iraq War when our country initiated that war years ago. I spoke against it years before the media told us the Iraqis had no weapons of mass destruction. Apparently my political views got me on some sort of watch list and as I'm a law abiding citizen, no dirt could be found on me, so I've been harassed instead. The torture helped lead to my illnesses, and has made my life a living hell. I am just an ordinary citizen with no agenda, I worked over 20 years as a legal secretary/legal word processor, just a worker bee, supporting myself and my mother and siblings, nieces/nephews, etc. I thought I had freedom of speech and freedom to disagree with a war I thought was wrong. Yes citizens can speak, but I've been taught that it'll cost.  On several instances I was physically assaulted but for the most part I've endured over 10 years of psychological abuse. Therefore I have first hand experience of psychological torture, and as this film began with a person being physically tortured, I couldn't get past that scene; tried twice.  Difficult to view fictionalized interrogation scenes as entertainment given my life experiences and also as I suspect this type of treatment is dealt to prisoners worldwide everyday.  Not to my taste.<br /><br />P.S. I pray daily for myself, our country, and our world. I hope we make it out of the hole we've dug for ourselves.
141659521X|5.0|Go to Vince Flynn's web site for a complete list of books and the order to read them.<br /> I have bought the whole series from Amazon.<br /><br />I LOVE THE SERIES!  We need some Mitch Rapp's in our countries arsenal !<br /><br />WRITE MORE<br /><br />Shipped quickly and priced well
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I'm sure there are people out there that raise their children like the couple in this movie did, but to sit for almost 2 hours and watch it was just annoying and frustrating. Aside from that the movie did have a few funny moments
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wow, it is so great to watch episodes I missed.  This is a wonderful service.  I loved being able to catch up with the history.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Wow. Just wow. This book was insane, in a good way. The character development was brilliant, I felt Christine's emotions. I was terrified for her, I cried for her. If was as if I knew her. The twists and turns, the ups and downs never stopped. I thought I had it figured out several times but every time I had it wrong. That makes an amazing author, one who can keep the pages turning and the reader guessing till the very end.The writing was phenomenal, smart. Well done.
B0011Z3334|5.0|This will forever be one of the best Alternative Rock/Punk CD's of all time. It is amazing lyrically, it is instrumentality too. And best of all are Hayley's vocals, she has an unbelievably beautiful voice!!!!!!<br /><br />GET IT NOW
B00CFITJKW|5.0|I think this is a great game! The only thing that I would recommend is to add more controls. Over all It is a fun game!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Very good. Much better then I expected. I love the tracking on this, very well done and not generic. Defiantly get this
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I had herad so much about this movie I thought I would be disappointed once I saw it. I was wrong. It is so well acted - true to real life.  It is all so true that people who do us wrong, love us, support us, etc. mold our personalities in a certain direction. It is also true that love sneaks up on us when we are looking and can't see what is right in front of us. Good story, good movie. 5 stars for this one
B009NY43NY|1.0|don't buy book get for free at scribd.com not worth your money the book is nothing but trash. i hated the book it doesn't make sense from the others books she does a 180 completely without preparing her readers.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Changes in the story for the movie improved the organization and flow of the book and made it flow easier.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Great entertainment for all the family!!!!  Watching it more than once a setting. Highly recommend it to my friends and family!
B000P6PVLC|4.0|This movie moves quickly from events in Morocco to events in Mexico and on to events in Japan.  It's almost like watching three different movies.<br /><br />However, just when you wonder what is happening with all the unrelated shifts there comes the realization they are related.  The suspense builds in Morocco and you think you will get to see what happens next and then - Mexico or Japan.<br /><br />Eventually as the plots thicken again and again you are surprised by each turn.  The endings are uneven in terms of tying a neat bow on each drama, i.e., there are different ways to interpret the concluding scene in each setting.  In my case, the episode in Japan left me wondering &#34;is that all?&#34;<br /><br />Brad Pitt is good. It's debatable, however, if this movie is his best film performance.  If you enjoy suspense, you will like this movie.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is entertaining and the characters are well developed.  I enjoy the fact that a woman can handle both career and family.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game to play. The more you play the more you want to play. Recommend it highly.
1400082773|5.0|I liked the book because it confirmed what I thought He was. He should never have become President because he is not doing what is good for the country but what he wants.  It'.s not working and he is too much of a narcissist to care.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I have found this app to be very useful. I can create separate books for different thing and find them all in one place.
B004X75RK4|4.0|the formula is a little old but the acting is good and its fun to watch.  Bullock is her usual good self.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can hardly wait for Season 4 and I am on the U.K. list to receive notice of when it will be available.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Highly recommend. As usual, Lee does an excellent job writing for Reacher. The pages fly by and keep you entertained.
B0064MT1U8|3.0|The story is ambitious enough, and offers some whimsical and entertaining moments, and the story line although somewhat scattered is interesting, Paltrow is weak, and Scarlett Johannsen would have fit far better in the role.
B001GLYMK6|5.0|The likelihood of this couple pairing seems a stretch in the beginning, but in the end, fate plays a very big role in them being together.<br />Her sometimes wacky character plays very well against his conservative nature. Makes him realize that there is more to life than just being together. Great story.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This is the best album Blake Shelton has released.  I love all his other music but this one is just fantastic.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Blake and Amanda!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love this app. I have been reading a lot lately and sometimes disagree with the book until I look up the word in the sentence and understand all the meanings of the word. It puts a new perspective on the topic after I have researched. There are some words I've never heard before so its nice to know quickly what they mean. Also my family/friends and I have been in debates on pronunciation, love how this app will say it for you as well. Love this app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Written in a different format, but that was the cool thing about it. Did not wNt to put the book down.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Loved it so much<br />It was so amazing and I had the best time of all playing It i would definitely get it again
B005Y8KWNS|1.0|It performance is so poor. Doesn't  recognize some documents and slow response. There are diferent options of similar and free apps that works better than that.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Good actors, good story line, poor execution. There were too many times during this film that I was left wondering when is something interesting or suspenseful going to happen. Too much time muddling around for broken city to be considered a good suspenseful drama film....my opinion
B008JFUTT0|5.0|But also the best movie I saw all of last year.  It's so hard to find documentary films with stories as riveting as this one, but when everything comes together like it does in Searching for Sugar Man (interesting people, amazing story, told in a perfect dramatic way), it's a true joy to watch.  I honestly just don't see how it's possible for anyone to watch this movie and not love it.  It has everything.  I'd give it six stars if I could.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book as a gift, but as a preschool teacher I have to say it is one of the best interactive books I have seen. The book can be a great way to teach colors to a young child. It will keep a toddler/preschooler entertained because it is interactive. The boys I bought the book for (1 year & 3 year old) LOVE it. Their mother was also a huge fan, saying it is a book that the entire family can enjoy. It is a family experience, not just a book. Buy it and enjoy!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Takes strategy and a little effort. So much fun. Only change I would make is more plague types to unlock.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Freezes a bit but still fun. Now it's making me type more words in order to submit.  So here they are.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am honestly the last person to probably read this book and still not see the movie yet on this planet.  It's fantastic and gripping.  Hold onto your seat because you can't get to the next page fast enough. i can't wait to finish and read more. I hope the series never ends. i'm addicted. And i'm not a big reader.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have no problem with this app its almost too good to be free. I enjoy it and its simplicity amazes me.Keep up the good work.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|The members of Zep are still Masters of their craft. Jimi P simplifies his leads a bit from the crazy 80's, but it works. Page works his voice like a musician. He croons where he used to screech with profound grace. John Paul Jones is in top form as well as young Bonham. Excellent cinematography and recordings. Superb.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Must watch for scifi fans. Sorely missed. You will only be disappointed that there isn't more. I do prefer the series to the movie.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|The Lean Startup opens up a lot of really interesting ideas on how you can &#34;pivot&#34; your business and react quickly to market conditions. Ries offers insight on applying lean engineering techniques and scientific principles to business conditions. Maybe in hindsight, this isn't so surprising, but this is not something that is so obvious. Propose a hypothesis, test it as quickly and efficiently as possible, and then adjust your tactics and strategy. So good advice, would recommend this read. Of course, some of the timelines and techniques from web based startups need to be adjusted to other industries, but the basic principles apply.
B0097K21YW|4.0|Burn the City is a rather cute physics type game akin to Angry Birds. In this game, however, you are a monster trying to burn down cities. Think Godzilla, but a bit cuter. After getting this as a free app of the day, I have to say I really enjoyed the game. Here are my pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Plenty of levels for longevity<br />- Good graphics<br />- Appropriate sound effects<br />- Somewhat unique twist on the \\"Angry Birds\\" formula<br /><br />Cons:<br />- As some other reviewers mentioned, the fireball doesn't go through the center of the reticule. I found more often than not it passes through the bottom of it.<br />- Physics make sense for the most part, but sometimes does glitch a little bit. About as much as other games in the genre, but it's still noticeable.<br />- Scoring system does make sense, but could use a bit of clarification maybe? I've been playing this haphazardly throughout the day, and I'm finally thinking I understand the system, but for someone who just picked it up it might be confusing.<br /><br />I have to give this four stars. I've more than enjoyed it even with the cons I listed as they're all manageable. In fact, if the fireball passed through the center of the reticule I would probably go ahead and give it 5 stars. It's a solid game with small flaws. If you like Angry Birds but want something a little different, this is the game for you. I think it would be worth the 2 dollars that they set the price at.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|First, if the government censors are concerned about the content here, well, nothing is here beyond the usually available material with regards to tactics and strategy. This is a good story on the training and planning leading up to the raid, and then the raid itself. It is a fun read, but quality of story-telling is only good, not great. It is a quick entertaining read that shows the level of dedication of our tip of the spear soldiers. You will come away with a good regard for their work.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|The graphics are great, the game action is very good.  I would recommend this game to family members and friends.
B0062ABRDQ|5.0|Good story, good characters, great actors.  Not the best production values, but too fancy of editing and filming would not fit this movie's persona.  I like the theme of guys (and girls) from the old city neighborhood supporting each other through their trials and tribulations.  I saw the film when it was first released and in comparison to today's direction standards the film moves slowly, but I think the film has stood the test of time and is still a very good film.  I highly recommend this film.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Great story, great scenery, very good actors. I live on Kauai and love this movie! Great inspiration for all to see.
B008OOYALE|1.0|this is such a copy cat of dragon vale you can do the same thing on dragon vale except the graphics are better
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome! Its really fun and i cant seem to put it down! Everyone will love subway surfers!
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Good movie, good story line. dialogue and back ground music. Ordeals faced by young PI are really great. everyone Must see atleast once
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved the song Ho Hey. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the rest of the songs are even better than that one, in my opinion. I would say Ho Hey is slightly more &#34;poppy&#34; than the rest of the album, so if that's what you enjoy about it, I would suggest trying to listen to the other songs elsewhere before buying.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|Good album...best one she has had in some time...I would recommend it to any Rhianna fan as a must have.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought the CD and have been listening to it almost non-stop since. I love pretty much the whole CD.
B009NY43NY|1.0|*SPOILERS BELOW*<br /><br />If this is what Charlaine Harris considers the best book she could write, then maybe she needs to retire. Because this was bad. So, so bad! I would give it 0 stars if I could.<br /><br />The characters in this book were completely OOC. It's like CH removed the real Sookie and Eric and replaced them with these very unlikable imposters. All to end up with her \\"original plan\\" of getting Sookie with Sam. It's a betrayal of the characters she wrote for 13 books.<br /><br />Sookie has ended up at the same place she started. A waitress in a bar, living in the same house and with the same suitor she had at book 1. But she's not the same person. She started off as this innocent, insecure girl with little life experience but was open-minded and passionate. The Sookie at the end was angry, resentful and small-minded. She lost the humor and sassiness we see of her in the earlier books. The spark that attracted us to her was extinguished.<br /><br />Eric's no longer the Viking warrior ready to leap into battle and can't figure his way around the vampire politics he's had no trouble navigating through for a thousand years. He's given up everything to become a Queen's b**ch. That is not the Eric we've come to love that fought his way to become a big fish in a little pond and didn't quit, throughout books, to get Sookie's love.<br /><br />The inconsistencies in this book are horrifying. Either she has a really bad editor. In which she needs to fire and hire a competent one. Or she just didn't care that she wrote things that completely contradicted other things she wrote in previous books. Either one made for one clusterf**k of a book and a really lazy writer. You can't change the rules of your world in the last book just to fit the ending you thought of years before. The ending has to fit what you've already written. It needed to be believable. This ending was not.<br /><br />For me it's not really about the fact that Sookie didn't end up with Eric, although I admit I'm very ticked off about that. But it's also about the fact that we were led to believe one thing and when CH did a poor ending like this, it's really a slap in the face to the readers. If she's \\"had it planned since book 2\\" it's even worse. It's like saying she doesn't care enough about her readers/characters to try make it believable, she's just writing whatever she wants and people will have to deal with it, while she's laughing all the way to the bank. Who cares if it doesn't make sense?<br /><br />There's a certain amount of trust a reader gives an author. Trust that her breadcrumbs are going somewhere. Sometimes a story and its characters take on a life of their own and if it's a good writer they go with it, even if that's not what they originally intended. CH wanted to keep her original ending despite her characters and story taking a different path than what she originally thought. The responsibility is on her to change things while still making her original plan believable, not just accept the original plan simply because it was what she wanted despite anything else she'd written in the last 12 books. I would never be able to read CH again and trust that I understand/believe her characters/story.<br /><br />But she had no problem changing her \\"original plans\\" when she wanted to kill Bill off in the 9th book. She was convinced not to because it would've damaged True Blood and put readers off from reading her books. She rewrote it and injured Bill instead of killing him. But when it suits her, she's sticking to her \\"original plan\\" and shouldn't we just respect her for having such integrity.<br /><br />Sam might be a better choice for Sookie (although that's debatable), but to get there after stringing us along with Eric throughout most of the books is just appalling. If she wanted to stick to her original vision, she shouldn't have written about Eric for so many books. She baited us with Eric and then switched it with a boring, uninteresting character that had been friend-zoned ages ago.<br /><br />When I read any kind of romance in any book, the best part for me is the path the characters take to get to their HEA. The laughs, the conversations, the sexual tension, when they start realizing their feelings, the fights, the obstacles they have to overcome to be together. We were cheated out of all of that with Sam. There was no build-up. The romance wasn't fleshed out. On the contrary, they have non-passionate sex (Seals? Really???) that is probably rebound sex.<br /><br />Sam was basically her only option before vamps, he's now her only option after vamps. If I were Sam, I'd be ticked off that my girl chose me because her only love left her.<br /><br />If they were each other's HEA shouldn't we have seen that in other books? He was nothing more than a secondary character that came off like a brother figure. He was friend-zoned at the beginning of the series. He was one of very few people who was her friend in Bon Temps. She had more chemistry with Quinn and he was only there for a small amount of time. And I would've rather she end up with him if not Eric. At least they had some spark together.<br /><br />I don't think she chose Sam because she was in love with him, she chose him because she didn't have the one choice she really wanted. Sam was the safe choice. He was the one that could give her the HEA with the 2.5 kids and maybe not the white picket fence, but the house with a blooming garden.<br /><br />Instead of a grand love affair, she settled for the boring friend. He was so boring that he, being one of the few unique shifters that could shift into ANY animal, decided to shift into a safe and uninteresting collie.<br /><br />That's not the HEA that I consider befitting our beloved Sookie.<br /><br />This has been the only series I read of CH and will be my last. I don't care to read authors that don't seem to care for their characters and get mad at fans who do care about them. There are too many good authors out there to bother with bad ones.racter that had been friend-zoned ages ago.<br /><br />When I read any kind of romance in any book, the best part for me is the path the characters take to get to their HEA.

B0092S4WLY|1.0|This game is very dumb it doesn't make sense i couldn't figure it out and there was no explainations on how to play it or anything so i deleted this game
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide is demonstrated with data numbers and video; humans are taking no notice; too bad
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is an Awsome search engine you can find just about anything you are looking for to download or just search for or find thank you so much for GOOGLE
B009R5GR1K|3.0|A good comprehensive dictionary with both American and British pronunciations.  The paid version gives you nothing but freedom from a few popups.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|If you're looking for a \\"good\\" movie, you will be disappointed with Jack Reacher, but if you're looking for an *entertaining* flick where Tom Cruise kills a lot of bad guys while solving crimes, this is definitely worth renting.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game but way to many social media requirements. I wish I could just play and not have to review, Facebook like, and tweet about it just to advance my progress.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I have enjoyed most of the HP movies. Alan Rickman was a wonderful choice to play Snape and Maggie Smith is excellent as McGonagall.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find it easy to navigate through the bible.I would definitely recommend it to others.I like the way I can easily compare other versions.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I remember when I first read HP and the Deathly Hallows and thinking &#34;How are they going to make a movie when most of the book is Harry, Ron and Hermione roaming around the country side?&#34; I found myself fast forwarding through parts of it. It is my least favorite of the HP series.
193700788X|1.0|I have read every book in the series and enjoyed most of them. I have also read every other CH series as well, I just like her writing style. I preordered this and dove into it as soon as I got it and read it cover to cover. No surprises in this book. A very bland, rushed and disappointing ending to a wonderful series.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|There are parts of this movie that I wished they would have kept the same as the book. The final duel between Voldemort and Harry took place in the Great Hall and the wands formed a shield. I found myself fast forwarding in parts of this movie too, but not as much as in Part 1.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Edge of seat suspense, drama, action, and sentiment. Acting is very good for a TV program? I would recommend watching
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Found this book riveting.  It is a good book for book club discussions.  The ending leaves you pondering the book.
193700788X|5.0|As Charlaine Harris said repeatedly....she was not going to be able to please all of the fans.  If you are a reader of her community boards, you can see every possible argument for the story to go many different ways.  SPOILER  Truly I wanted Sookie with Erik because I have been a huge fan of their romance.  The language between those two in the last few books had the writing on the wall.  The end question for my became..two fold.  1.  If Sookie wasn't \\"under protection\\" anymore, what would happen to her  ie Niall/Erik/Bill were all tasked with this.  2.  How was the writer going to extricate her from being a pawn for the vampires or even the r weres?  I believe Charlaine Harris worked this out very well for the ending.  Could there have been a few more details we as readers would have eaten up?  Absolutely!  Am I satisfied with what I got?  Yes.
B0000542D2|2.0|A Hard Day's Night is a curiosity that only screaming, raving teenaged Beatles fans can give 5 stars. The film has next to no plot (other than getting the boys together at various times to play music) with odd characterizations for each Beatle, and a few auxiliary characters thrown in for good measure, including Paul's grandfather who spends all of his time trying to escape supervision so he can gamble and pick up women.<br /><br />The film-making is shoddy, with so many of the lines dubbed over mouths that clearly don't match, it is laughable. The aimlessness of the movie conjures up comparisons to French New Wave films, but the effect, if intentional, is less successful here.<br /><br />The music is illustrated through pantomime over a pre-recorded soundtrack, as were television appearances at that time. Most of the songs are straightforward scenes of the boys playing instruments and singing, but a few are backgrounds to action. The title song opens the film with the boys running away from screaming fans. \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is the most like a traditional music video with the boys innocently dancing and playing in a park. \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" begins with the boys playing cards on a train but magically they begin playing instruments with a captive female audience.<br /><br />I can't help but compare this movie to Spice World, which obviously drew a lot of inspiration from this movie. But that film, although it features a less iconic group, is better because it has more structure and development. This film is only worth seeing once if you've got some time to kill, but it is by no means a classic.
B0089LOG02|4.0|A look back in history. It causes one to reflect on their family history and where they really came from.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This story had me from the very beginning.  I love the depth of character Kvothe has, he's not just a hero, he's a boy, a man, a child, a friend.  I can't wait to read the next book!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Acting was very slow and seemed foreced. Lincoln was portrayed as an embarrassing jokester. Not enough historical background...Not very well done.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I am glad this app was free because everytime it was played it stopped at the same spot and to get out of it I had to reboot by phone.  However it was cute when it played and you could go a long way within a playing session.  That is you did not have to wait for additional factors to continue playing.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|It fits in nicely with all of the Terminator movies. The stories are well connected and the characters are solid and well acted although it takes the young John Conner awhile to get his head in the game. It isn't as specail effects hweavy as the Movies but there is enough action and explosions to satisfy.
1594481717|1.0|A compilation unscientific ramblings amounting to the conclusion that liberal arts is the way to go to succeed in life. The author ridiculously makes the case that the west can out source left brain aka technical activites to asia and still call the shots using \\"touchy feely\\" high level management ability. The reality, as is becoming apparent with the hollowing out of manufacturing and economic / social stagnation in Europe, is that people with this thinking are heading towards economic irrelevance.<br /><br />Further more he quotes a survey stating that more than 75% of the people who are engineers would like their children to pursue a career in nursing. Mind boggling to say the least.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|I love this movie so  much! I love that it was available for instant download! it played perfectly. My night was made.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Cute movie. I'm so glad I had prime to watch on my Kindle and didn't need to pay for the movie. The movie quality was great.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very addictive game I cant put it down. It gets frustrating some times,  takes awhile to unlock new suits but overall great
0062183591|4.0|I never cease to be amazed by human behavior, and so I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Since childhood I have worked to tell the truth and to do the right thing, even when it is hard. I was curious about the topic, and enjoyed learning how other people make these decisions.
1932100660|5.0|This book is easy to read and so informative. It really makes you think. I wish everyone I know would read this book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Game is not what I expected it is a lot better than I expected so good you should get iron man 3
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Very enjoyable series, heartwarming.  A little bit like &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; European style. Interesting characters and beautiful scenery.
B000S398WU|4.0|It's very good, just not passionate.  The only reason that I did not give it a 5 star rating is that it didn't blow my totally away. I still would buy it again.
B008NW67E0|5.0|One of my favorite bands... lyrics are fantastic and love to listen to them at anytime, anywhere and in any mood!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Takes some computing power, my old HTC Incredible is not up to it, but my Dinc 4G LTE is more than enough.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Watched it with my kids.  They are 2 and 3 years old. They watched it all the way through.  It kept their attention.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I always loved this game. It is well made and challenging.  I would buy more old style games. Asteroids would be cool.
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|Great sounds to absorb! Very soothing and yet down to earth.  Mayer has a good grasp on his art.  Great work!
B00BESNKB8|2.0|Watched this with a couple of friends and it was unanimous - no one got into it, due primarily to being too boring, in addition to being just plain stupid and uninteresting all around.  We were ready to call it quits on this 1/3 of the way into it.<br /><br />Streaming consistancy and Audio/Video quality was good in HD version.<br /><br />My suggestion for a better movie somewhat similar to this would be an action/comedy called \\"The Good, the Bad and the Weird\\", currently on monthly streaming service, and a kung fu drama/parody called \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\", on dvd/rental. IMO, this movie sucked compared with those. Even a repeat viewing of \\"Kill Bill\\" or \\"Smokin Aces\\" would be better than this I think.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It's a great game, I would've preferred to pay $10 $15 up front rather than get into the game and get tempted by th  in game purchases. All in all a cool game.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is a fantastic writer. I have read every book she has written. I wish she could write faster.

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|First of all it is a decent first mouse from this company and they have great customer service. But they overlooked a couple things that might annoy some people to the bitter end. Nothing deal breaking for some. It's just you need to be fully satisfied when paying 40 dollars for a piece of plastic and a laser.<br /><br />First off, why in the world can we not shut off all the lights, or at least make them the same color ffs, and why can I not change the color and brightness of the DPI and scroll wheels separately? I absolutely cannot stand little blue lights in my gaming sessions. I'm already getting a small piece of tape out to cover the blue. Mind you, almost all mouses have these unswitched lights I am just mystified at this point in time why we cannot turn off all the lights on a mouse much less have 4 or 5 of them on at once. You can change their logo color, and shut it off, but the DPI lights and mouse scroll stay blue and on all the time? Haha, not exactly thought through very well or just dropped because of costs. Well, it is one more reason I am passing on this half-baked product.<br /><br />Right side of mouse is that sticky, soft, and shiny plastic that should never find its way to anything you have to have your hands or fingers on! Can't stand this and it's on one of my favorite Coolermaster mouses so you learn to live with it I guess. Still needs to find its way promptly out of mouses.<br /><br />Anker DID see fit to make the material on their clickers great. But why would you not keep this great moisture wicking material for the entire mouse? Seriously, stop putting shiny plastic on mouses. Nobody likes this stuff and it is uncomfortable to touch.<br /><br />After some fine tuning I seem to be able to get something I like out of the movement with this one but it still seems off. Plenty of options with their 1.1 upgraded software. They do need, however, to put more information on what the hell half this stuff is doing. Most people don't know what company specific polling, DPI settings, and acceleration or pointer speed do in combination. Well, everybody really. You have to kind of just start clicking on things to see if you can find that spot you like. Compared to my Logitech M505 wireless IDK this mouse seems as laggy or even more. Not sure what is going on. After 1000Hz tuning and getting my DPI on one light I made some changes to pointer control and it seemed good. Not great though. This isn't a mouse I would ever use for accuracy or where lag is concerned. It just feels off. They do have full DPI setting control if you want to get more in-depth but tbh I don't see the point. There is something inherently weird with this mouse. I chalk it up to a cheap laser or the software.<br /><br />As for the form you more than likely will want slightly larger hands for this one. My thumb can rest on the back left thumb button that is smooth and I am okay with that. That is more a palm grip and that is the grip this mouse is made for. With my fingertip grip the rest of the buttons are not comfy on the left side. Some people may not like this layout but it works perfect for me. I am pretty comfy with this one besides that awful plastic, which, unfortunately, means this one instantly hits the return bin after review.<br /><br />I have no problems with programmable keys and connecting them to the keyboard keys. Others may want more options. Really though, there are better options for pure FPS players and MMO players and yes they cost a lot more. All in all they did pretty good here though as others said they could make things a bit more functional and charge 10 more dollars and I would have ZERO problems paying.<br /><br />All in all 2.5 stars because of that plastic, lag, and not near enough light settings.y specific polling, DPI settings, and acceleration or pointer speed do in combination.

B00BGIC4I6|5.0|We thought this was one of the funniest movies that we have watched in a very long time! I would highly recommend this  movie!
B0049985XW|5.0|Wonderfull old classic movie.  Great for watching with you parents.  Brings back memories of their younger days.  Great entertainment for all.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Yes it was great. It is what they said it would be. Yes, I would recommend this to someone else.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It makes you wonder whats going to happen next. What the heck would you do in that house living there?
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Yes it was great. It is what they said it would be. Yes, I would recommend this to someone else.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|We enjoyed it. It is a love type story for Teens in our view. Cute. It is a movie of, let's say, &#34;What would you do in this case&#34; Makes you think and realize how much someone would really give up just because of love.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is slick, intuitive, simple, and reliable to use. The magazine style layout makes flipping through my RSS feeds feel cooler than it has any right to be. I can prioritise what I want to see, flip easily from article to article, and trust that it will hide feeds I've already read. I feel a little silly for how cool this system interface makes me feel. It's easy to add and manage your feeds as well as how they're presented. But there isn't any bloat attached to this app. I use every feature it has, but haven't found myself wishing for anything else. Every function is useful and everything you could need from an RSS manager is addressed. All in all it's a solid, intuitive, and useful app. Highly recommended.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Watching it did bring a couple of giggles. You can simply see how both separately try to do things that are just to make them happy but the ending says it all. You have to watch it ALL the ways just to see what really brings out the truth.
1439102732|3.0|It was just ok.  Kind of overdone.  It was an easy read though, and others might enjoy it.  Thank you
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Remarkable clarity of picture and sound. Loved how campy it was, and the dialogue and one-liners are legendary. I could recommend this to more people than the previous two movies, as amazing as they were.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've tried other ebook readers and have always gone back to this one.<br />if I have a book at home I can use their &#34;send to kindle&#34; service and then get it on my phone.<br />I use calibre to convert pdf format to mobi.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Great movie, astoundingly quick delivery, and an overall classic. My friends don't appreciate older horror movies, so you may not like this if you don't know what you're getting into. It's a great gore flick with some very disturbing imagery. The cinematography is the highlight of this movie for me.
B00BQI4AU6|3.0|Well, after a few spins, things kind of fell short for me. In no way was I expecting Cinderella, but I was hoping he would catch more of that Bad Seamstress Blues type vibe.<br />With that being said, Tom does a great job here for all this guy has been through. I thought his vocals would be hindered, but does a great job. Some of my favorites are:<br />Solid Ground - Closest to Cinderella<br />Cold Day In Hell - Rolling Stones type vibe<br />Fools Paradise - Great song<br />The Flower Song - Don't ask why, by Rod Stewart comes to mind, but vocally great.<br />Aint That A Bitch - Great song, reminds me of Tom Petty at times.<br /><br />There are a few ballad type tunes here, neither bad, nor memorable. This is where I expected things to shine, but fell short. Ask Me Yesterday, reminded me of Kiss Hard Luck Woman right out of the gate, but then changed things up, but probably my favorite of the slower tunes. That's ok, though was not hoping for a bunch of slow tunes. All in all, a good mix of tunes, but less than half of the tunes are keepers for me. I hope Tom keeps moving forward and if he comes my way with a show, I will attend.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|A great movie. Extremely hard to predict and very entertaining. Would recommend for a Friday night and a Saturday night at best.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Without getting too scientific , it's a hard working device , that does what you want it to do ,<br />and it pumps enough juice for Apples + Androids alone or together ,  powerful yet small .

193700788X|1.0|This book series started out well, but has been dragged on too long and the author lost the plot around book 10. It was obvious from the writing quality that she has not cared for a while and has put in minimal effort.<br /><br />The plots were overused, full of inconsistencies, ESPECIALLY in this book and the last, and the heroine becomes less and less relatable and her actions less understandable.<br /><br />I did not purchase the last couple books, I read them at the library instead, because I did not want to waste my money. I'm glad I did, especially after having read this book that I borrowed from a friend.<br /><br />I only stuck it out until the end of this book series because I was hoping, that despite the declining quality and obvious lack of effort, that the last book would pull it out and give the readers a satisfying final intallment to the series that made sense. I'm sure many other readers felt this way as well, as evidenced by the decline in the ratings in the reviews for the last couple books.<br /><br />That was too much to hope for, and I should have known better.<br /><br />In this finale \\"effort\\", the characters were unrecognizable, the plot a sad attempt at closing out the series and full of inconsistencies and laughable, contrived conclusions that make no sense if you have read the 12 previous books. I'm disappointed I ever bothered with the series in the first place.<br /><br />Wihout getting into spoilers, don't expect a satisfying ending, or an ending that makes sense in the least for the characters after the growth we watched them experience. Don't expect to like the characters by the end.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the readers that started reading this series when book 1 first came out. They will very likely be extremely disappointed and even disgusted by the finale of their 13 year investment.<br /><br />Edit: I want to add, that with this last book (and it started with book 11), the writer offically throws her own supposed metaphor for equal rights out the window. She essentially, in the end, declares certain supernatural groups \\"safe\\" and certain others \\"dangerous\\" as a whole. It's like her saying they deserve equal rights, but to stay away from them because they are not to be trusted and are dangerous because they are too different. \\"Separate but equal\\"...where have I heard that before???!!<br /><br />What message is this sending?!! Not only is this offensive, it's disturbing, and the writing loses all integrity. This last book continues down what I could only describe as a religiously fanatical path. The heroine believes certain lives are worth more than others because of what they are. Really??!!! We're supposed to root for this woman, a character that over the course of three books became slowly unrecognizable and unlikable, to the point of becoming a bigot? It started with a few seeds being sewn in book 11 (just enough not to warn/scare readers off), and culminated in this awful book.<br />In the last few books the heroine devolves, and it all reeks of unfounded moral superiority and self-righteousness. Is the message supposed to be it's okay to settle in life as long as you have your (disturbing) \\"morals\\"? It's okay to give up and end right where you started? There was NO point to reading books 2-12. You might as well just read book 1 and this one. You literally wouldn't miss a thing with the way this final installment is written. I'm not joking.es certain supernatural groups \\"safe\\" and certain others \\"dangerous\\" as a whole.

B008YWY0HK|3.0|Wasn't at all what I expected from Disney and I was rather disappointed.  It was cute but the story line was weak and the character was not what I had hoped
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Very endearing story of a man in search of an old friend who is ill. He also is in search of answers to his own life choices. Somehow he decides to just walk the over 400 miles to find his old friend! Along the way is the real story. The people and circumstances he encounters and how they change his perception of life, the world, and who he is as well. Harold's wife is always looming, left behind by her husband as he continues his 'vision quest'. His departure leaves her with many of her own unanswered questions regarding their life, marriage and events unspoken.<br />I really loved this book and would recommend it to all readers! Definitely a different story but just wonderful!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Almost better than the first and Josh B nailed K's character.  It's worth watching again and again just for that.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|As a Scot this draws such a true portrait of Scotland , warts and all. I loved it and want more Rebus,
0312576463|2.0|I read the whole thing in a few days, but about halfway through I began to doubt that it would ever come to anything. And it never did. The characters just got less and less interesting and the attempts at creating unexpected dimensions for the characters rang hollow and lame. If you want to read a really good book about a disintegrating relationship in suburban America, read Revolutionary Road, a book Frazen has talked/written about favorably.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really awesome and fun other people should get this. I gives it two thumbs up. You would really like subway serfers. XD
B0091REZMW|4.0|Pretty fun app. It takes up a lot of your time when you play because you cant put it down!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks!!! The characters are really really reallh awesome! I hope they do a Paris one. This is my fave game!
B005N95JA4|5.0|Rolling Stones are arguably one of the most influential rock bands of all time. They've had many great albums starting off from the early '60s all the way up to their classic '72 record \\"Exile On Main Street\\" which is a favorite by many fans. They had a slight decline from 1973-1976 even though I enjoyed \\"Black And Blue\\" quite a bit and it was my favorite of the era, it wasn't real consistent and wasn't quite up to their usual standards. They return in 1978 with \\"Some Girls\\" and it's an excellent return to form. There's a bit of everything including rock, blues, disco, punk and new wave. Many fans seemed disappointed due to the disco influences although I didn't mind it and \\"Miss You\\" is the only track to have disco influences. There's a couple other hits including one of my all-time favorites \\"Shattered\\". \\"Some Girls\\" is one of the greatest rock albums of all time and why the late '70s is one of my favorite music eras.<br /><br />Highlights: Shattered, Miss You, Lies, Respectable, Beast Of Burden
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's is a really fun app. It keeps me busy for very long periods of time. I would recommend it to anybody
B003B02O14|4.0|No one is better than Grisham at introducing us to a &#34;bad&#34; guy, and through the story, turning him into the person that you root for to succeed in what he has set out to do.  Throwing in a few surprises along the way, the storyline flows from bad guy to not so bad guy, to good guy, with a surprise ending that you may or may not see coming.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game the graphics on it are AMAZING! I'm not that good at the game,but it's still awesome. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is awesome; its much better than my cell phone.  I'm 50 years old so its easier to see and quicker to compute.  This sure beats squinting and leaning on the basket while trying to shop.
1597801585|1.0|I read a lot of SF. I tried to read this book. I thought, after 1/3 way through I'd keep at it.  By 1/2 way through I gave up. Interesting ideas but just not an interesting story.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and would love to see the sequel. Jennifer Lawrence put  on a very good performance.
B0076D21O2|5.0|The film adds fuel to the &#34;who really wrote Shakespeare's plays and poems?&#34; controversy.  True Shakespeare fans must watch it - you might poo-poo it, but you have to enjoy the &#34;what if's&#34; that it brings up.

B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Laura Mvula has a great voice, the melodic arrangements are different, the lyrics are uplifting. If you are looking for something different that will have you humming, lift your spirits and put pep in your step this CD is for you. Laura is a musician's musician.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I guess the developers felt the need to keep up with the Jones and update ES File Explorer to a pseudo-Holo theme. Like Astro, it disrupted the usability flow of the app. Even with the &quot;classic&quot; theme, you cannot go back fully to the original UI.<br /><br />I was hoping ES File Explorer wouldn't mess with the usability after Astro changed theirs. But in the event they did, I made a backup of the previous kindle and google play versions so I could can &quot;rollback&quot; via sideloading. Sure, if the developers add a new cloud feature in a new version, I'll be out of luck but I can live without it (after all, I'm still using the 1st gen kindle fire).
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I loved this book. It is a mystery /suspense book and it keeps u at the edge of your seat
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Interesting plot.  Terrific acting by all.  Four stars for language. Movies would have been just as good without all the expletives!
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Yes I loved it!!!<br />It's funny how one single fan wanted Jennifer Lawrence to play Melanie. Are you crazy? Saoirse Ronan is the best actress right now a bit underated but still Amazing.<br />Anyways, loved the book and loved the movie.
B0041QSZJM|4.0|Pink Martini music quality in a Christmas mood... nice sound. Not my preferred but still good enough to deserved to be listen with pleasure.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book, very dangerous and sexy. You never know what might happen next, it's wonderful for those sleepless late nights. I would recommend this book to anybody that I looking or new and excitement into their lives!
B008CPZNL6|3.0|With the current hyper over Flipboard 2.0, it is really disappointing that Amazon only has 1.9.19 available.  Guess I will have to sidelosd the most up to date version.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm going to miss Sookie, but I have to admit the latest books weren't as good as they had been, it was time.<br /><br />It was an edge of your seat on a roller coaster ride type of story.  It was a great ending to  a wonderful series.  I can't say much more without giving away the store.  It's a must read for all Sookie fans!<br /><br />I hope Charlaine plans on writing a new series.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The problem I see with the other reviews is they rely heavily on the past films to back their ideal of what these movies should be.  Problem?  This is Iron Man 3.  Not 2, not 1, but 3.  The movie was excellent, and highly entertaining.  If you're looking for a think peice, then go watch an indie film.  This is an action packed thrill ride with Robert Downey Jr. flare.  Very fun to watch, and definitely worth 3D and not just the silly 2D format. Loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it was amazing recommended for all ages. a truly great novel thrills at every turn and some romance .between peeta and katniss
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings has earned the word \\"Epic\\". The world is big with major and minor characters. My favorite major character (and favorite of others) is Kaladin. His journey throughout the book sucked me into the book and was the reason I couldn't put the book down until I finished it on Monday morning around 1 AM. My favorite minor character is Szeth, whose every chapter I read twice. I felt like an epic sort of soundtrack should be played to some of Szeth's chapters because they were just that good. Anyways, this book must be read.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this nearly every night-- helps turn my brain off so I can finally sleep.  'Heavy rain' works especially well.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am speechless!!! I loved Fifty Shades of Grey so much that honestly did not think there was book to top it!!! There is and I found it! I can not wait to start on the second book!
B00CL68NOG|1.0|A few funny lines but it's annoying in every way possible. I skipped to the end because I just wanted to know what happened.
0060531053|5.0|There is no better book on homebrewing for the beginner and novice that I am aware of.  The author is the embodiment of the hobby.<br /><br />If you are thinking about starting, I recommend that you first read this book (skipping the chapters on all-grain brewing, which is the mark of advanced  homebrewers).  This book will give you a good idea of what you are getting into.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Saw the movie and then had to read the book. The book is excellent. Do  main love the character of the book. Hope the series<br />gives a little more information on his personal life.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Writer is obviously very talented but story was far too black for me.  Wish I had researched the book more before I bought it.  Never again trust best seller list.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It is weird to experience the end to a series that I have read over so many years.  Taking that into account, the ending leaves me feeling a little off.  I thought the book was a decent read but it seems like there was more of the story that should have been told.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The twist at the end was unexpected but I kept wondering about her friend Jo next door. the characters were believable and the sad story of spousal abuse is too often too true in our society.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is a great mini-series. I do hope that they keep bringing this one back. Once you watch the first one you will be saying I NEED MORE. It's just one of those shows that you want to see again and again. If you have a chance to watch the season I highly recommend it.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I don't usually give out reviews but I have at admitting it was hard to finish the book it took me a whole week to finish this book when if it was interesting I could have read it in one night. I believe if it was a little more back round on both main character s it would have brought the story to life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A twist at every turn......never expected events on every page...<br /><br />Must read to the end, it will surprise you....I promise!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|After putting months of my time into this series I had become so invested in the story and characters that I didn't want it to end! Not necessarily how I wanted it to end but a fitting ending nonetheless. I will miss Sookie and everyone in Bon Temps!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Somehow I ended up with two and paid for two. My wife used the second for a gift. I guess I found it, selected it, and went offline for a bit and my cart was remembered but I did not take notice, so I ordered it again.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I really like this game. I'm not thrilled with seemingly having to pay for stuff or not be able to progress but other than that I like it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Love the move count, timer, and score. Layout  also is also nice. You can also customize your view with personal pictures.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because it is the best.  Indeed it is the best and that is why I gave it 5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is a nice little diversion. It is entertaining. Even adults can have fun with it. Wish stuff didn't cost so many acorns though.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Wow!  I wish more software achieved the user interaction with the output results easy as MyScript does.  I can't wait to see what's next from this software developer.
B004SN8Z4S|5.0|Great shoe.  The fit was right on and the product does not disappoint.  I recommend this shoe to anyone that wants to try a minimalist approach to footwear.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Mr. Gerber relates in an easy going way how to get a good start with a new business or how to re-energize a failing or lackluster business.  He covers it all and you can use it to rediscover why you want to start or fix your business.  Step by step, it will help you focus.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This is an excellent ebook on tying various knots in paracord. I would recommend this ebook for the novice as well as the experienced knot tyer. It is an excellent addition to watching the youtube videos of his knots.
1451673442|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I would suggest this book for anyone looking to change their life. I'm a total fan of the whole &#34;Secret&#34; movement.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|A gritty tale of someone trying to get out of the crime world.  Mostly I watched it because I heard about Jeremy Renner's Academy nod and I wanted to know how the now-action hero faired in this role.  He was great and kind of disturbing and not at all heroic.  Well-worth watching in general.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|Isn't making lots of money...in total conflict with pursuing true happiness? Being a stockbroker is such a dry profession. Is the cutsey little kid supposed to lighten Chris' money making goal? If he were really looking for happiness wouldn't he find a way to try to avoid money as much as possible? Try to avoid working as much as possible? Why do people want to make lots of money? Is it just for their ego? What's wrong with renting a small room somewhere, working a 9 to 5 job, and bringing home just enough for the two of them to spend time together? This movie raising a lot of questions in my mind about \\"What is Happiness?\\" Is the happiness supposed to be the relationship with his son, or is it this Super Duper Fancy Job for Super Duper Smart People? To me, happiness would be raising your kids in the woods, having a simple life with a few other people. Isn't capitalism in conflict...with happiness? Capitalism is selfishness.<br /><br />Would Chris Gardner be \\"happy\\" if he never got the multi million dollar *dream* job...because he had his cutsey, imaginative, playful son?  Why wouldn't that be enough for \\"happiness?\\"

B007IK44CK|4.0|I liked this Mission Impossible maybe the most out of all of them. It takes itself lightly in many ways (goofy characters, failing technology) that make it a rather charming action movie.<br /><br />Cruise is as cruisey as ever and his supporting cast compliment him well. I saw this in the theatres and was happy about the money spent.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This Spartacus series did not suffer from the new lead actor, though initially you will notice a difference. Still, this is such a great series with a lot if intrigue and combat. I am looking forward to the next season when I have finished this one.
0062238868|5.0|I bought this book for my partner. The book arrived in good quality and my partner read it within 3 days! Very interesting story.
B00AZKCU7G|1.0|Not what I expected.  No drama to speak of.  It was very historical, but concentrated on slaves rights too much for me.  He was so much more!!
1475212607|4.0|This book was very helpful to me as I published my first eBook. Clearly written and relevant, a must for any newbie self-publisher!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't get into Firefly until the show was off the air; my introduction to it was the movie. After being so enthralled by Serenity I quickly picked up the series and am still shocked that this show was so short-lived compared to the many others that survive on TV. The writing was consistently great, the cast had wonderful chemistry, the effects were as fancy as they needed to be and not over the top; a good mix of action, comedy, drama... I would recommend this show to practically anybody, not just fans of sci-fi. Give it a shot by watching the pilot somewhere first and if you like it, or even if you're on the fence, get the whole series anyway, it's not that long or pricey.
B004EPZ034|5.0|My two year old loves this movie. My husband and I enjoy watching it with him. We think it is very funny.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Both this show, and this blu ray set, are incredible!  I'd never seen Game of Thrones before purchasing the blu ray, and it is one of the best purchases I've made; I've already watched all of the blu rays multiple times, and they definitely hold up after multiple viewings!<br /><br />The blu rays themselves are great quality in terms of picture, sound, etc.  It's also wonderful to have the complementary digital copies of both the episodes and bonus features (for me, that allows me to easily watch my favorite scenes {like those between Daenerys and Drogo}) whenever I want just a little taste. I will warn you that these particular digital copies do take a really long time to download to iTunes (I purchased this season and Season 2 http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Complete-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B0060MYM7O/ref=sr_1_1_ha?ie=UTF8&qid=1368277573&sr=8-1&keywords=game+of+thrones+season+2+blu+ray at the same time, and my computer was literally downloading for over a week without pause).<br /><br />Bottom line, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by this purchase! There's nothing that I can see not to recommend the show, and the blu rays are top quality. Great storylines, great acting, terrific characters including plenty of strong female leads. I can see this show appealing to all ages (well, teenagers and all ages of adults; I don't think the content is appropriate for children). When you consider the fact that they literally created a new language (Dolthraki) for the show as opposed to creating just a few words for the actors to say, you have to imagine that a lot of effort was put into making this show, and it definitely pays off. It's wonderful to see such a high quality fantasy show that both remains relevant in our time, and is highly entertaining..definitely recommended!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Ture, this damn thing has its name right! As the name implies &#34;thunderbolt&#34; the speed is extremely fast. Made downloading times a breeze. I downloaded gigabytes of information really very quickly (of course the major factor is your ISP speed subscription).<br /><br />This item does not require a genius to use, so I won't bother explain how to use it. Hence they even provided an image as a reference for usage.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all who have Macs with thunderbolt ports.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Loved it!  The second season definitely lives up to the first season, and I would completely recommend this product.  The blu rays are in top quality, and I was thrilled to have the digital copies (although for this and the download of Season 1 digital copies http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Complete-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B00AB55BS0/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1368277822&sr=1-1&keywords=game+of+thrones+season+1, the download took over a week on iTunes).<br /><br />This show is really one of the best quality shows that I have come across in a really long time. The writing is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the characters are multi-dimensional, real, and in some cases inspiring. I love all of the strong women leads (for me, Daenerys really makes the show what it is). I will also say that those people who are not fans of the books may still enjoy the show. With no disrespect to George R. R. Martin, when I tried the books after viewing the show, I wasn't really a fan of then in written form, which may sound odd considering that the show is supposed to be pretty reflective of the books, but I found that the writing and the ways in which the characters are presented in the show versus the books came off differently.<br /><br />Wonderful show, and highly recommended once again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because its really fun and a good stress releiver for me. you getcto feed and care for a horse and event it and you don't need to buy gems because they are easy to get.

B000OJFV4C|4.0|I'm kind of a history geek, and I especially love Tudor England so this show is very interesting if not overly dramatised. Nonetheless very very interesting
B009KWU6Q2|1.0|i dont know was just something about the movie.<br />it was a nice concept but i think the problem was with robin williams.<br />he was forcing everything to be a joke it seemed like and not just letting it come naturally.

125000098X|5.0|This work can only be described as epic. I have read every Jeffrey Archer book ever published. Once again, he's delivered a magnificent story. Best Kept Secret will surprise you and truly keep you on the edge of your seat. So many questions about the Clifton and Barrington families are answered. Archer's writing style is unpredictable. All of the characters, form Harry Clifton to Giles Barrington, come to life in this monumental third installment. However, the ending will leave you speechless and wanting more. I for one cannot wait until the next installment!

B00BKBCM4A|5.0|I'd heard several of the songs from this album. This is one of those rare albums where every song is quality, but I especially like Wildest Moments, Running and Taking in Water. Looking for a new artist to discover and enjoy? Buy this album; you won't be disappointed (unless you don't like quality vocals, song writing and arrangements).
B00CATSONE|2.0|It seems as though it's written for a younger reader but it was still enjoyable and I'll recommend it to certain friends.
B003CH9PV8|5.0|This season got cut short by the writer's strike, so it's only 7 episodes.  In a sense, I think the strike may have helped the show.  The writers weren't tasked with trying to figure out the show and the characters too soon and with the first season being so short, it gave them a lot of time to really expand upon everything in season 2 (which is phenomenal also).  But what you're getting here is 7 of the finest, most well-written episodes television has ever seen.  Seriously, all 7 are so well-done, and if you watch this first season and aren't obsessed with the show, I'd be very surprised.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much if yu don't have this game or don't know about then this is your chance to get it and also if yu are bored and need something to do this is your game right here if yu can't get it and yu know someone  that has it then ask them to play yu will get so addicted to this game yu will not be able to go to sleep tonight. Ps love this game. Oh yea!!!!!!!

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addictive. I had it on my phone 1st, but it's nice to play it on my 8.9 screen :D<br />Great way to kill time ;)
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My family loves this game. I've played this with friends and family and found that we could have a pretty simple game setup and running quickly, over in an hour or so. We could also, depending on the mix of players, get into some very strategic games that took longer and where the lead swayed back and forth amongst all 3-4 of us. Board games often get overlooked in the MMORPG day, but there is something different about gathering around a table and playing a game together that is satisfying in a different way. I'd highly recommend this; my next step is to buy one of the add-ons (leaning towards Traders & Barbarians at this point) to mix things up even more.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love it. Simple as that. Great graphics. Looks beautiful on my 8.9 screen. The game play is also not hard to get used to.<br />The only complaint I have is sometimes it lags. But hey you have to remember...All this for free ;)
B00881VLCE|5.0|Magic Puzzles is a great way to work on puzzles.  First, there are so many types backgrounds to choose from that you won't get bored.  I love the option of choosing the number of pieces in the puzzle, so I can make it easy or more challenging.  The best part for me is that if I am not able to finish a puzzle in one sitting, I can store it safely away from my cat--and I won't lose any pieces!
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Came across The Lumineers by accident (those recommendations *do* occasionally pay off).  Every track is good, some are downright excellent.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This works really well on my Kindle Fire HD. I like it even better than the old Missile Command game I loved as a kid.
193700788X|5.0|Seriously, I feel like some people are more upset by who Sookie ends up with than anything else. If you didn't see that one coming, you haven't been paying attention! I'm happy with who she ends up with. I was not disappointed by the story at all and I liked getting to see Sookie's many friends.<br /><br />I think it's sad that Charlaine Harris's many fans are treating her like she betrayed them. Books are always the author's vision and we're invited along for the ride. If you don't like the ride, get off. I'm not saying don't let authors know when you don't like something. They all want to know how their fans are feeling, so they know if they're doing their job entertaining us. But you don't need to be outright mean about it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|.Classic missile command game. Responsive. Fun long term. Good for all ages. Upgrade equip. Repair buildings. Bonus rounds. Try it out.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Only wish it was up all the time so I could keep an eye on what the Fire is doing.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|From someone who never read the book I was left scratching my head over several unanswered questions.<br /><br />What was the former Russian prisoner's involvement in the corrupt corporation that was behind the murders?<br /><br />How did the police detective become involved with the Russian's organization and why?<br /><br />Where was the fall guy when the shootings took place?  I assume that he was drugged by the bad guys since there was a shot of his fingerprint being placed upon the quarter but why didn't he just explain this to the cops when he was being interrogated?<br /><br />I understand that the subsequent beating that placed him into a coma erased his memory of the events surrounding the shooting but how could the bad guys have known that this would occur?<br /><br />Was the fall guy actually knowingly involved in the shootings since he had been seen at the shooting range with one of the bad guys?<br /><br />While I understand that the defense attorney was initially only concerned with trying to avoid the death penalty for her client, when confronted with Jack Reacher's theory as to why her client might be innocent wouldn't she have immediately grabbed onto it rather than complaining that it wasn't her job to find the real killer?  Maybe not, but isn't it part of the job of a good criminal defense attorney to try to prove that someone else could have committed the crime other than her client?  Isn't that a means of trying to present reasonable doubt to a jury?<br /><br />Why would the former Russian prisoner's obviously proficient right-hand man wanted to put Jack Reacher out of commission, why did he allow the job to be outsourced to a meth dealer and some of the most inept stooges imaginable?<br /><br />If this film was good enough I might watch it a second time just to find some answers to these questions but frankly it wasn't entertaining enough to warrant a second viewing.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love the Android app!  I can do all my searching from wherever I am!  Just like on the computer...only smaller!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Wish it was a longer rental period.  This movie is fun for parents and Kids alike.  Love  it and would rent again.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|It was great to read this story again - great in a sobering way. It's such an insightful tale about life and the price we pay for what we choose to value. It's as relevant today as the era in which it was written. Read this one!
0061950726|5.0|This was a selection by a group I belong to.......and it turned out to be a wonderful book that all of us enjoyed.  Loved it! Bittersweet story, but part of our history.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Safe Haven was a great movie! The book was also good! This movie will not disappoint you. It is a must watch
B0036UW09U|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine.  I have worn out so many of the soundtrack albeit vinyl, 8 track, cassette, on and on.  There is only one song I don't like but the rest are timeless.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It was exciting and full of life. The sc-fi elements enhanced the story line and made it work.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and was a joy to watch it again and most likely will watch it again.
B008Y1YK0I|3.0|Love the movie. 4th version I've owned.  The audio on the restored version for DVD seems more like the theatre and not so processed. The Bluray is out of sync where the DVD dialogue is at least intelligible and includes the atmosphere of the natural settings.<br /><br />The picture on the BluRay is wonderful. The color is the first thing that jumped out a me.  70mm is a beautiful format and the DVD looked washed out.  This is like seeing it in 70mm in the theatre. But the audio mix feels off and this is because I'm comparing it to my theatre experiences seeing this in 70mm.<br /><br />Update 1* into the first 30 minutes of the film. Again, the visual is unequaled. It's beautiful. But the audio track in the opening desert scene has lost all the atmosphere of original soundtrack.  The vocals sound like dead overdubs, and the ambience of the desert is missing and the Foley FX sound fake.<br /><br />Update 2** If you are having sync problems with the BluRay turn off 24p on your player and it should line back up.  At first I was disappointed thinking they had botched the audio all together, then I changed the 24p setting on my player from \\"auto\\" to \\"off\\" and it synced up fine.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|Loved it first time I saw it as a child, love it as an adult.  Streisand is so timeless no matter the year a movie is made.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I have it on my home computer and play it often, now I can play it when I'm @ the doctors office, instead off looking<br />througth 5 yr. old magazines.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I've had fun with this, as have my kids.  I've not found in-app purchases to be at all necessary to enjoy this one.  It seems to have fair replay value, and unlocking the power-ups has had a consistent time/difficulty ratio,  so while it gets harder,  your ability to get the achievements also improves.  I think using the in app purchases might even detract from the pleasures of progressing through this title. It is modestly inventive,  as well as polished.  The permissions are explained from a link from the game's start page ; you may wish to consult your legal, technical, or medical advisors to assess your risk and comfort level.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Roy Orbison had such a unique voice.  These songs were his hits, and had a lot of great musicians playing with him on this.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The game is fine; slow moving and doesn't involve &#34;friending&#34; everyone to get items.  The music is calming and the graphics are beautiful.  It is very glitchy and sometimes freezes my Kindle Fire requiring a reboot.  I have had to uninstall it and reinstall it to get it to work, and it sometimes does not give me credit for completing tasks that were completed.  While it may be for kids, I enjoy the slow pace and beautiful graphics.  But the bugs have got to go!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't really know how to play multiplayer. But other wise I love this game and I think the $7is worth it. I wold really like to know how to play multiplayer.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|This is a great movie and Tommy Lee Jones still has it. The plot is great and you will never guess who done it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game has so many different words to describe it.So three words&hellip; best game ever. now random crape gyyt cgcgv yccrt y fy yfuf tfyf.  ffgtfu. tftf f.  ycyyt t ftff Tycho g. try to say all that<br /> I Kent crap not crape
B000FA6720|5.0|This man has a very unique vocabulary.  He describes true love in a beautiful way.  His experience in this love affair makes the reader wish for the same. A very clean and sensitive tale.
B0041D843M|4.0|Great studies put together about the foods we eat and the consequences it can have on our bodies. Surprise at the idea that doctors don't lecture on reversing most illness by consuming a plant based healthy diet.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I'm a big fan of Stephen King books.  This was definitely not my favorite.  But it was a quick journey to the edge of my seat and kept me reading.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a great book. It was the best out of the three. If you have read the other 2 this one is a must.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Being a part of a five part series, will always keep one in suspense, especially as this is only part three. One tends to get impatient. However, Jeffrey Archer is a master of his craft, and he means to keep you in suspense. The book is so well written and is easy on the eye and hardly put downable.One relates to the families concerned, and I for one, will certainly be standing in the queue to get the next episodes.So Amazon please use your influence, and get things moving!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Cloud Drive Photos great for having photos readily available for spare-of-moment sharing events with family, friends, and colleagues.  Loving it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book.  I couldn't put it down, so once I finished it, I read it again.  By far my favorite book of the year.  Lets hope the movie version does it justice.  It's a gorgeous read.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A suspenseful supposition of what goes on among  the North Korean elite and peasants citizens.  Cleverly put together with characters that seem to be real and molded by the society there in some very fanciful ways.  Descriptions are complete, bizarre and yet somehow believable.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Typical Michael Connelly.  Always entertaining.  Love his twists and turns.  Cannot beat the characters. Always leave me wanting more, can't wait for the next Haller book.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Fast shipment and the DVD was great quality. No scratches and no case damage. I love this movie. I remember watching this when I was younger. Great movie for all ages!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Something about this game is extremely addicting. I enjoy the long term rewards and music to go along with the game (...you can turn music off). The theme changes every so often, keeping it exciting. This is one of my favorite apps.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it its great I mean like it's so good that all me and my buff do is play it when she comes over.I also like that you can be a great white
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Seemed like a number of other films all rolled into one.  Glad I didn't pay for it.  Girls take center stage...
B00005JKNF|4.0|Julian Fellowes is at his best with this one. It was a wonderful proving ground for the likes of Downton Abbey. He has honed his craft very well indeed.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I loved the first two books in this series - however this third offering leaves much to be desired. Little plot development - is mainly about giles barrington and then sebastian - and when it finally gets going it ends ubruptly!! No doubt to make way for the next in the series - which hopefully will be far better than this one.  Am willing to give Jeffrey Archer the benefit of the doubt on this one - but sincerely hope it is a one off bad one. Not a happy reader....
1939416019|5.0|I honestly could not put the book down. The way Morgan brought detail to the writing just puts you there. Great job!!
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|As usual this book is really well written but the goodies are always good and the baddies so bad. In my experience no one is all bad.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I prefer a different format, but I still get news very fast and can search for news that isn't on the main page.  I gave it a 4, because many people use it for various things.  I just wanted a Google search engine that was at my fingertips.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|Made in 1956, this movie was a big-budget film.  Today it shows it's age but the special effects were outstanding for their day.  I hear a modern remake, this time a trilogy, may be in the works.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've been using yahoo mail since my first deployment in the desert storm days.  I had one little glitch, but it was because it needed an update, which I did and my E-mail came right through.  I use a home computer for most work, but love the quickness of getting my E-mail while traveling.  Great product.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a really good app but I am still waiting for the new update and when is it coming out
B0066O0NP6|5.0|Thrilled Amazon Prime has The Good Wife and is beefing up it's prime eligible video/tv library.  Great show!  Excited to see the following seasons.
B000F8O35U|3.0|Both DVDs inside were scratched for some odd reason, and skips some. The package was completely sealed, NEW. I'm just guessing it was a mistake from the manufacturer. The seller was great, sent it out promptly, great price.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|of flow free &amp; bridges, this is not made by the same people, its ok but no where near as good as the others, the reaction to your finger is slow and I cannot put my finger on it (pun sort of intended) but it just seems to be missing something that the other two had that kept me absolutely rapt<br />Still fun just not quite AS fun and i'm not exactly sure why
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Listened to it for first time today and did not disappoint!  &#34;Lady&#34; is one of my favorite groups since Beatles!  Yeah, I'm THAT old, but still appreciate great music when I hear it!
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Great story which kept me glued to my Kindle. I couldn't wait to &#34;turn&#34; the page in anticipation of where Kingsbridge was headed.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Barbara Streisand is what made the movie for me.  She can be serious in some movies, but when she does comedy she really can make it come alive!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It's a great defend and attack shooter! The guns are all very accurate(besides the quad bazooka. The in-app purchase are fine, but please note to fully finish the game you are going to have to buy about $5.00 in flu credit. If you think about it thought the game was free and a shooter like this would cost about $5.00. Please add online multiplayer!!! That would be epic!!
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Lots of fun, regardless of age . . . Somewhat addictive!  Definitely recommend giving it a try! My 6 year old and I take turns playing.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie is great! We rented it on Amazon and it skipped the last 20 minutes and went to credits. I skipped back a few scenes and then it played the rest of the movie.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I love all of the songs that this cd have I can't complain I used to have but I lost it so I had to buy it again cause I loved the songs that this cd have
B003DCPGNS|4.0|I had never watched this movie before and was quite surprised at how good it was. Manipulative Hepburn steals the show!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I missed it when it was airing. So glad I am able to see it. I love everything about this show, actors, costumes and storyline
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is addicting and extremely fun. I play this game all the time. You should try this game and download it.
B007ZYJMU8|1.0|Simply hated this movie.<br />The \\"F\\" bomb was used over 200 times, my guess.<br />I had to watch the remainder just to see if there was anything good about the movie, There was not.<br />The movie starts with the main character killing a dog and the movie ends the same way.<br />This is not \\"Art\\". It is just pure garbage.
0061743526|2.0|I have not read this book yet, but I will in the future, if it is the good Lord's Will that I do so.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Stargate SG-1 is one of the best series of all time, and season 2 did a great job setting up for many of the things to come later on that made Stargate the hit that it is.
0811875555|5.0|I was blown away by the quality of this book. I've not previously purchased any of Disney's art books but after receiving this in the mail I might start collecting. The book has a wide variety of concept art, sketches and finished pieces. It's absolutely outstanding.
B0017KIBAI|1.0|This was NOT the official product that I paid extra money for. For the cheap generic-brand controller I received, I could've spent literally 99 cents AND get it brand new. Instead, I spent a good sum of money for a supposedly official Nintendo controller that was not only a used generic brand, but also very cheaply made. Although it functions, it has a very different feel, including the feel of breaking any given moment. The design is bulkier and the handles are closer together than most Gamecube controllers, yet the product itself much lighter, which makes it feel extremely delicate and breakable. We used it the day we got it, but none of my family or friends have been willing to pick it up since. If I had paid 99 cents for it, like the listings for the generics give, I'd give it three stars. But this was not worth the price I paid.
B0097K21YW|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but for this one i just had to. I've tried and played a lot of games for the android, this i have to say is one of my most favorites. I only just got it and started trying it yesterday and i have to say i'm hooked.<br /><br />In terms of the concept of the game it is probably closest to Angry Birds, in terms of it is a physics based game where you launch projectiles to destroy things. The style of the game i don't really have anything to compare it to, other than to say the artist(s) who worked on it created a very cute style and characters while not making them cutesie (read: not childish)..<br /><br />I'm currently through the first 45 level set(the night set) and am currently playing about 16 in on the dawn set(the second set).. As i've progressed through the levels not only do you get more complex puzzles to solve but you gain new abilities such as grenade, tnt, and sniper fireballs. Also to further complicate things in some cases i've had to hit things to gain them enough momentum before being able to shoot them lose so i could still destroy the city (aka, if you don't give the stone item momentum first and just shoot it it will block your shots)... The levels increase in difficulty, one of the ones i completed just about a half hour ago i had to shoot down planes at just the right time to use them as tnt missiles to destroy what i wanted. Also recently i've hit some levels where there are gusts of wind that affect my shots that i have to compensate for or utilize to achieve my city destroying goals.<br /><br />I've never found myself laughing at an android game before, but something about this game just does it for me.. Its something about the gratuitous nature of destroying the cities in increasingly fun and complex ways, but it's also about these silly humans who keep making cities with  giant wrecking balls near them or such too.. Lol..<br /><br />All i have to say is, try it, give ti a shot. if you like angry birds or just want to relieve some stress and have a good laugh destroying things, this is the game for you. To the one person who reviewed saying it was too repetitive, they clearly didn't get very far in the game, because as you play i've found it keeps things quite interesting with the new skills and tougher/more complex levels and difficulty.
B004YRSBTW|5.0|This is an edge of your seat thriller produced with an amazing way of storytelling. Recommended to me by a friend.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I great &#34;biography&#34; of Alfred Hitchcock.  It actually is more aptly titled &#34;The Making of Psycho&#34;.  I didn't realize the many hardships Hitchcock had to endure while trying to bring his masterpiece to the screen.
B0095P29EG|5.0|If you like these type of films you will enjoy Thor. Entertaining and a good story. It's a good watch for Marvel.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|No matter how many times I see it, Psycho always delivers.  Hitchcock at his absolute best.  If you have never seen it, you have to watch it.  This movie is responsible for transforming the horror genre into what it is now.  It is the benchmark by which all others should be compared!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Very imaginative!!  Great Story Lines and good chemistry between the cast members.  I Love Major Shepard, Obviously he plays the O'Neil character from the father series.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The movie is not as good as the book (no surprise there) but they did a good job and the special effects are really good. I CANNOT wait for the next two movies!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Been a long time since I seen this movie so I had to do some searching to find it... Great movie... Love the guitar
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Colorful, fast paced and fun. Some great variations on the usual match-three games. Couldn't stop playing for a couple of hours!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Daniel Day Lewis personified Mr. Lincoln and Sally Field was excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome.  I love how it is fun and hard.  I like that it does the season 's of the  year and different  country's.
B003E88TKS|2.0|The trailers made us think it was a comedy and it was not.  The acting was good but the story was depressing.
B001LM1456|3.0|Tried to pack too much into the hour and something of the movie. Love action, but could have used more depth. Still enthralled with the whole Avengers series and how each individual film leads into the main Avengers movie
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|Who does not love Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant?  It is entertaining and delightful!  The group of friends add so much also.
B002KREVCO|5.0|I've only listened to the first six songs on the first CD and this is without question a must for any ACDC fan. Absolutely incredible material! Why did it take so long to get it? anyway, I felt compelled to write a review because it is really that good regardless of the second CD or DVD. I will update the review after a full listen of all items but if you like old Bon Scott stuff buy this immediately.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My Mom and I are enjoying every minute of the Downton Abbey series.  It has been pure pleasure watching it.
B0092EE5HY|3.0|Like Philip K. Dick before him,  Martin has a wonderfully luminous imagination but only workmanlike skills when it comes to writing.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Confusing but  great game overall.. it will take awhile to get the higher armours unlocked but it's very addicting very fun game
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I did not know this was really a superbly acted documentary. It's an episode in the life of Mark O'Brien, a 38-year-old surviving in an iron lung and wanting to become a normal person. It is inspiring. But becoming so-called normal is definitely not for prudish viewers. O'Brien (John Hawkes)  does not want to die a virgin and seeks advice from his priest (William H Macy) with unexpected results. Helen Hunt, acting the role of his sex therapist, along with others, is brilliant. O'Brien, in reality, is a university graduate,poet and journalist achieving magnificently against the odds. His work has achieved a lot for disabled people who were sent to institutions regardless of their intellect. I have since obtained a Kindle version of the book, How I became a human being. (from Amazon of course) to learn more of this remarkable human being who died aged 49. Expecting the book to be as good as the movie, I am in for a great read. The extras with the DVD give inspiring backgrounds of actors and O'Brien himself.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've never been skeptical. Nor can my faith be waived. However, there are doubters all around me. Reading Eben Alexander III, M.D.'s book, PROOF of HEAVEN was validating, uplifting, and a joy.<br />Eben III's journey was poignantly written with a healthy dose of pathos on his physical, intellectual, and spiritual challenges - of which he was miraculously healed, has grown, and acquired faith (respectively)!<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B0063M22QO|5.0|lots of fun<br />challenging different layouts keep this exciting to play for hours try it you will enjoy it. See how many layouts you can be successful at
B000FIMG68|5.0|The series is so charismatic and enticing. Every character has his/her own personal battles and choices all the while struggling to make the most of their current state of situation...Lost
B006FE83UE|5.0|First of all the story is very compelling. One of the best novels about the south from back in the day. Very well written and masterfully perform by Mr. Peck and all the rest. Would recomend this book and film to one and all!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|The series is so charismatic and enticing. Every character has his/her own personal battles and choices all the while struggling to make the most of their current state of situation...Lost
B009NY43NY|3.0|When I first finished reading DEA I was irate. So I took a few days to think about the review. I can imagine endings are hard. There is no way to please everyone, someone is bound to be mad. But what I have read of the reviews there are a lot of people upset over the ending. The story line itself wasn't that bad. Even who she ended up with wasn't bad. But the dismissal of certain characters made me mad. When they were so important to one another.<br /><br />The ending should have been certain at least. Not a &#34;probably&#34;. Hopefully the last book will tie up loose ends and tell us what happened to everyone and especially about Sookie and the one she chose. Hopefully by then it's a certain thing :/  maybe even a flash forward so many years, that would be nice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an amazing game it is like temple run only better. I am so addicted t  this game it is ridiculous. I get in trouble all the time because I will be playing this game and totally forget about my chores but this game is totally worth getting in trouble. It is just so fun that I almost never put it down. I remember one day I played it for 18 hours straight it is awesome.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|this is always been one of my favorite movies and it always keeps my attention until the very end lots of drama, very funny at the same time
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like how the charactors are cheaper and you get upgrades. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But i don't really like the hard stuff!
B00BI745AA|4.0|But too much singing. I wish they would have a little less singing.<br />It was still a great movie and the acting was remarkable
1616550414|5.0|Very nice book, great illustrations, complete infomation about the whole saga and it was everything I expected when i purchased the book.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I have to question myself, laughing so hard at a violent, gory, politically incorrect film like Django Unchained but you will do just that. This film is funny as hell, and somewhere in all the craziness on screen is a beautiful love story. Just one caveat, do not watch this film on a full bladder...
B006LSZECO|4.0|Compelling read. Wish ending was different. The characters were full of surprises.  Lots of twists and turns. Couldnt put it down.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great combination of puzzles, HO, and adventuring.  The story is interesting, and there are a few unique features like the &quot;evidence wall&quot; that make the game fun.  Beautiful artwork. Very enjoyable!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books they have the right amount of romance, suspense and hard to put down until tomorrow feeling.<br />I'll watch for the movie version for sure. He has given us so many novels that have remained my favorites.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|Good reading for anyone who enjoys the era of colonialism and the scramble to take over African<br />property by greedy European nations. This book concentrates on Belgium's King Leopold and his<br />Insatiable plunder of the Belgian Congo.
B003XE3G0Q|5.0|The goods are excellent and I liked very recommend everyone purchase of the product and the speed and access to postal Excellent
B005LAII3U|4.0|When I left the Cine I said I what copy of this.The Movie has little to do with the previous version or the TV series but like a old song by a different artist you still like it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This was a great second book to this series. It had me going till the very last word. I thought i knew how it would end but it kept me guessing. I cant wait till 2014 so i can read how it ends.
B00005R2IS|4.0|All-way what to no more about the people & town he left behind. The sequels seem only have a lost survivor in common.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next rooms. Going to replay this game right now , it is that good. Best app I have ever played and I play a lot
B0044XV3QY|4.0|I enjoyed this in 3D cant say that about many 3D films. The disk in the storybook is one a a very-very few presentation folders that work after the first look.
B003NX75B8|5.0|I love the message that was conveyed in this book. It's all about acceptance, and love, and I just loved it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|add me!! this game is awesome! ! its way better than farm story! farm story you get harrassed by other players:(
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love the detailed information.  Audible alert are also available.<br />It is a  useful tool at a next to nothing price.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|You have to read Mazerunne first to get the gist of this story.  It really has some quirky turns and surprises.  Some of the deaths are gruesome too.  I like this series though.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Being a teacher, some of the scenes really hit home. I loved the tough love approach of Coach Carter. His players weren't to pleased at first, but came around. Much like the students I deal with. I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|We really enjoyed the film and the music. I'm sure we'll play it again. Also ordered his CDs and going to his concert this week. Excellent!!!
0547884591|2.0|Over-ambitious. Tries to do too many things and not good at any one of them. A few decent recipes and techniques but lots of flotsam.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|I must admit I thought James Blake's first album was nice, but this is a HUGE jump. Deep, synthetic, new, natural, all of the above. Blake outdoes himself here.
0345472322|5.0|The prime concept is simple to understand and can be applied immediately. There is plenty of room to develop its use personally, and in the roles many of us share: spouse, parent, coach, team player, leader, etc.<br />I am recommending this as a foundational tool to my coaching clients.<br /><br />Jim Grew<br />The Business Transition Defogger
0156027321|2.0|Overly detailed storytelling, a plagiarized story premise, and politically correct \\"deep\\", tiring musings on the fact that all religions are one. The result is as artificial as it gets. I couldn't finish the book, and had to rent the film to see how it ends. Believe me, I wanted to like it! I bought it from Barnes and Nobles convinced that I was going to love it based on the hype. I love magical realism, like in Marquez, but this is \\"artificial realism.\\"  If you like the genuine article, even the diamond in the rough, this is not your book!<br />PS1: The only thing I liked, which is why I gave it the star for, was the idea of the enemy (tiger) that keeps you alert. But the parting from the tiger in the end was rendered as such a melodramatic cliche!<br />PS2: The plagiarized concept source is the novel [[ASIN:0452284538 Max and the Cats]]
B000YJ85BI|3.0|This book left me feeling the same way I felt with the later Ender's Game novels, that what I though would be a military Scifi series turned into a &#34;hey can't we all just get a long&#34; and &#34;humans are if not evil, then morally suspect&#34;, this was a let down from the great beginning to the series that was Old Man's War
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Again, I am now a devoted fan of this mini series, and can not wait until Season 4 airs!<br />I've heard it won't be until 2014... Of course, if you have been watching all the episodes, you<br />won't want to miss Season 3! The season ends in a cliff hanger, and I actually cried and screamed at<br />the end. You'll see why when you watch the final episode.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|on a business I always have a hard time sleeping.  this app has so many sounds to choose from that I was able to select the most relaxing for each evening.  the timer feature was nice so I could fall asleep without having to worry about turning the app off.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I thought it was a cute movie but not as humorous as I expected. This is more of a chick flick.
1932907009|5.0|I'm a screenwriting novice and thought this book did a terrific job of introducing storytelling concepts. Snyder's writing is charming, easy to follow, and informational. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to start learning about screenwriting. Thank you, Blake! Thank you!
0345495004|5.0|Not only well written but it keeps you wanting to turned the page. She engages you in the story and the ending is breathtaking
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This came exactly as I was told!  CD in great shape!  Thanks ever so...The CD reminds me of my kids when they were teens...
B009GED3HS|5.0|Great show, great product, and I am happy I bought it. Good, light-hearted, and funny show with lots of lovable characters!!
1885167776|5.0|Though most of the items presented are common sense and believable, it is the presentation that rocks in this book.<br />* Physical book is nice form fctor, big fonts, multiple colors, bulleted items and easy to absorb important points<br />* Lot of diagrams<br />* hand written interjections catches eye<br />* Underlining looks real<br /><br />Shows how one can achieve success by variety of means - focus on one thing has been emphasized in a very good way! Lot of quotes make it lively e.g., \\"To get through the hardest journey we need take only one step at a time, but we must keep on stepping\\" Tells that juggling or multitasking cannot make one productive at all. Most of the things appear common sense to me, and in fact are. It is almost like the New Year Resolution. How do we implement these? Take one step at a time. Declutter yourself! These are answered in the book and I really loved it.. Now onto implementing them!
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|Okay I've only been a DP fan since Steve Morse joined the band. Perpendicular is a great album. One of my favorites. I have been a long time Kansas fan and got to know about Morse from solo projects, Dixie Dregs, and with his short lived stint with Kansas in the \\"80's. The  follow up album, Abandon didn't do it for me. The next, Banana's, I liked a lot. The next, Rapture of the Deep, had a few good songs, but I have to force myself to listen to it and Abandon, unlike the other two. This time, Now What?, is a very close second to Perpendicular. I might eventually have them tied. Apparently it's every other album from these guys for me. It is good from beginning to end. I enjoy it more with every listen and I've have listened to the full CD at least 4 times. Gillian, Paice, and Glover are solid as ever. Although in respect to the latter two, a bit reserved. It appears that the idea here was to let the newest two members shine on this outing and they both most certainly do. Airey has quite an impressive resume and he shows his talent and experience well. It's nice to hear keyboards so prominent in the mix again. Morse, well, he's the man. To the reviewer who said he didn't like his sound, every guitar player has his/her own sound and Morse certainly has his. He is not going to sound like Blackmore or any one else. I happen to like his sound. You have to listen to all the nuances of his playing. He really is amazing. The songs are all great, all have something to like. Out of Hand, Uncommon Man, and Above and Beyond are my favorites. Above and Beyond sounds like it could have been on Kansas's 1989 album, In the Spirit of Things. Probably because Morse played and wrote on that album and Bob Ezrin also engineered and produced both it and Now What? I can hear Steve Walsh singing this song. Anyway, I highly recommend this album to Purple fans and to classic rock fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book.  It is well written and has many layers.  I think there is a lot that applies to our day.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't usually watch British programs, but so many people were talking about Downton Abbey that I decided to see for myself. It is an excellent series and I can recommend it highly to everyone I know who enjoys a good continuing story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another excellent book from Suzanne Collins.  Might actually be better than Hunger Games.  Worth reading.<br /><br />Why does this have a word requirement?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters! The scenery! The costumes! And, of course, the story line! They're all great on this Masterpiece Theater series.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great product, looks great, easy application. Happy with speedy order processing. I am going to order more for my kids ocean themed room.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really liked this movie ALOT!!<br /><br />Matthew's character is unapologetically awesome.  The plot of the movie kept me very interested through out.  over all a very good film...enjoy!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Awesome game like the two first games in the series.<br />It might be too simple if you play it after Scribblenauts Remix
B0095P31L6|2.0|I expected better from Johnny Depp. It had some funny parts, but too much that was blah.<br />Kids may enjoy it
0151008116|5.0|This was such an awesome novel, made me wonder as I finished it, is this really a TRUE Story, but had to again remind myself it was a novel.  Such a good read on how amazing and creative one can be in the face of danger and the resources he came up with to survive.  Great book and it was a great movie also.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is an away app. U wand just looking for a different game to play. I would recommend it. To my friends who have a kindle.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This was bought for my grandkids and great-granchild's protection of the the Kindle. My grandkids love the color and the elastic I think the kids know more about the function of this item.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This is a very thought provoking novel about family, love, and loss as seen through the experiences of a teenage girl who is hovering between life and death. I think the book will appeal to adults as well as teens and young adults.  I reached the end too fast!
B009NY43NY|4.0|The title is very fitting. Lots of things are wrapped up; friendships, love and even hate all have their ending. I honestly feel that each character's life/being filled the path of the entire series. Overall quite satisfied.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Just like everyone else here, I have willingly and lovingly followed this series. I found the 13th installment engaging and appropriate. I picked it up at 4:30 this afternoon and was finished by 11:00 because I couldn't put it down. I think each character was given a fitting send off, including Eric. I absolutely adore his character, and I think the decisions people are so angry with were actually very true to his real character. Eric is always his own number one.
B0091R30MS|5.0|Utterly fascinating account of medieval China's exploration of the world long before Columbus and the other Europeans had let go of their mother's apron strings !
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Sorry, this was not a good movie for me, however, thinking Tommy L. Jones would be a winner! Didn't know<br />there different versions to this one movie.  Didn't do anything for me personally................
B000LW7OWE|5.0|Haven't seen this movie yet but got it for a special friend that loves The Doors and Jim Morrison and he was really pleased with it so that means I am too!
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I love watching this in the evening.  It takes my mind off work for awhile.  My children like it too, but it is not always appropriate.
B0052FG750|5.0|Got this for a very special friend and he loves it! Very pleased with everything. Thank you very very much.
B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent story line, great plot. I love the actors and the action. Great special effects. Love it. Love it. Love it.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|Our family loves this CD.  All the songs are done very well but, especially the duo by Jennifer Lopez and Andrea, Perhaps in English!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is tots awesome!! You should totally get it. You will love it! I love getting new characters and mystery boxes. Also the jetpack makes a nice touch.
B00005JMYI|3.0|In \\"Anchorman,\\" Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a sexist news anchor in 1970s San Diego.  Ron gets great ratings and aspires to be a network anchor, but change arrives when the station he works for makes Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) co-anchor.<br /><br />The film has another big name on the cast in Steve Carell, and the oldies soundtrack is great, but the humor in this comedy is hit-and-miss; there are several laugh-out-loud moments, but a lot of the other attempts at humor are overly contrived and fall flat.  As far as Ferrell movies go, I thought that \\"Anchorman,\\" despite having some great moments, didn't live up to the accolades it often gets and was far closer to [[ASIN:B0016MOV92 Semi-Pro]] than to my favorite movie of his, [[ASIN:B001G5T6GW Step Brothers]], on the laugh scale.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|I usually don't listen to Kid Cudi, unless its one of his more famous songs (day and night, pursuit of happyness). But found two other songs on here I liked also, so i decided why not buy the album, its cheaper than buying all four songs. I haven't turned of this album for the last 2 days, its on my ipod on repeat and ever second I play it. The albums great and I love it, but I'm probably going to wear it out soon haha. Its a great buy, one of the best kid cudi albums out there!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Mindless fun, as all A/B titles are.  Need to waste time while waiting in the car?  You don't need WiFi to play.  Always fun.
B000001IQH|5.0|While i think RANCID´s raw debut and their self titled album are their best stuff, AND OUT COME THE WOLVES is their most well know album and masterpiece!!!! You got some HUUGE HITS here like RUBY SOHO, ROOTS RADICALS and TIME BOMB, but all the songs are great going from PUNK to SKA, and some REGGAE.....Ah, i remind when this PUNK MASTERPIECE was created in the mid 90´s.....Those are great times for hardcore lovers!!!!!
B0086QS7N2|4.0|While I don't agree with all the philosophies of Rush, they are one of my favorite bands for their talents. This CD tells a story, following a boy trying to find his place in a world where the \\"watchmaker\\" controls everything. Some songs are harder than past Rush CDs, some are softer and very touching. All in all a very good CD. The digital booklet do not download for me though.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I really have a low expectation for this product based on many reviews but I give it a shot.<br />I decided to order this from Amazon. It works just OK. I can play Kinect games but it doesn't reduce the space needed that much as Nyko has claimed. \\"40%\\" less space is very exaggerated. I still have to stand further from Kinect. It reduces some space needed but not 40% for sure, more like 15 to 20% less space (I really have small room so this becomes obvious it's not 40%). Any game that requires a lot of space and distance from Kinect may not work well with this product.
B009FZFONO|5.0|You are always kept on your toes because every episode has a shocking surprise. People cope differently when disaster hits and this show captures it very well. All the zombies are unique, the action is great, acting is top notch and grest storyline. We watch it as a family :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is an epic game where a giant gorilla chases the heck out of you. It is much more intense, interesting, and there is a lot more twists and turns than temple run 1. I recommend this app mostly because it is free and fun for all ages. Plus, it has upgrades and different characters that you can buy AND there is much more upgrades than temple Run 1. Let's just get too the point, IT IS EPIC. It is one of the best games I have. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Being a native of the area from which the story is told I enjoyed the realism of the scenery, etc and the roughness of the characters. I am also a fan of the novel from which it was taken. Yet, something was missing. The ultimate bad guy had to be developed more.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|My husband and I were just dating when the Fellowship Of The Rings was showing in theaters.  The original trilogy brings back some of our fondest memories.  And An Unexpected Journey took us back to that wonderful time again.  Quite unexpectedly.  But delightfully.  Can't wait for more!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not my husbands cup of tea but I love these types of shows. Good amount of suspense. Not any boring action.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|Thought I would watch this after many years and I loved it. There is no substitute for excellence. Enjoy. It.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|See title. The one responcable for this should be ashamed...........and shot. A steaming pile of pig poo would be more fun and entertaining.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Saw the movie in the theater but wanted all of the bonus material you can only get on a dvd
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't  wait to start it, then couldn't put it down when I did.  Was great, wished they would come out with<br />another series like it.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great movie, great story, pretty people and talented actors. What more could you ask of the movie industry? Also a big step up for Jennifer Lawrence after the hunger games
B004TI1WME|5.0|i prefer  having the ability to see if  i've  made a mistake  in my  number input.  this fits the bill NICELY!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This app works fantastic. No need to convert file format just to watch on the kindle any more.  Just awesome.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love cool mario like games where its like Mario.<br />Rate 5 stars if you like mario, this game is really fun and i lived it<br /><br />T
B004GXZ69W|5.0|Its worth the extra money spend. Use it for home office work usually goes for 8 - 10 hours .This really helped me from the wrist pain i was having with the ordinary mouse .
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|ti's the game to love. the low craters are idiots who don't play. they low rate angry birds. completly. compatible. with kindle fire.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|I like this movie first, because it clean and good for the whole family. I like old movies and this is an oldie loving movie. Some may not like the movie because it is not like the new movies (full of action, but empty). This one is not full of violence, although there are some, but the main story is a good story.
B0017VG69U|3.0|Update - The entire first season has a very poor audio recording of William Shatner's narration over the opening credits.  You can barely hear him.  They fix this in season 2.<br /><br />My review is based strictly on the way the product is presented.<br /><br />First it comes in this stupid big oversized plastic shell with the starfleet logo on it that I immediately discarded.  Inside is a box just big enough to physically hold the DVDs for the season.<br /><br />You don't receive full size CD cases to hold each individual DVD, instead in some ridiculous effort to minimalize the packaging once you get past the stupid big oversized plastic shell with the starfleet logo on it, you get just the back half of a CD case for each DVD with the spines glued together. They fall apart after a couple openings.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Then they give you what appears to be DVD case inserts with information on the episodes however they aren't produced such that each card relates to the content of a particular DVD which an intelligent person would then place in the corresponding case for said DVD (should one choose to purchase normal CD cases in which to hold the DVDs.<br /><br />Can I just have normal cases and you keep the stupid large shell?  And how about printing up a card (if you are going to do it at all) for each DVD that can be placed in each case?  The face of the DVDs have no screen printing on them so you don't know what's on them anyway.<br /><br />I own a lot of DVDs of TV series which features TV shows in 1 hour format.  You know how many episodes those other shows are able to fit on a single DVD?  4.  So why is it some DVDs have only 1 show on them?  Especially when they aren't at the end of the series.  Some have two.  I love getting up to change the DVD after each episode or two I watch.<br /><br />Ridiculous.  Waaaaaaaaaaa.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|The web woven by martin is exquisite. The narrative makes it a movie and even better. The narrative turns and twists and you often leave the perspective of one character to follow the plot from another's. You have no idea what the other characters are doing in the meantime. It often leads to surprising twists that makes this series mind blowing. The characters are entirely human, that is to say, full of greed, cunning, debauchery,  valour, honour, kindness.<br />The sheer range of characters and the uniqueness makes ones' jaws drop at the wide canvas the author portrays and the kind of webwork he has to do to make them work. Reading this book is like reading a thesis in butterfly effect !<br />We have seen movies like crash that deals with similar plots in a smaller scale. This is just a million times larger and full of surprises. The books can slow down at times, i needed that to take my mind off the book and go do something else. So, its benign in its own way.<br />I'm reading this series all over again .<br />There is an Indian epic called Mahabharata that paints an even larger canvas that spans over 5 generations and is full of similarly intriguing characters. This series is second only to that, and by saying that, I have paid my largest tribute to any book.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good movie with a lot of action. Tom cruise play the part really good you have to watch from beginning to end!
