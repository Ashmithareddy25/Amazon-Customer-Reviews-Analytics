B00004RF8J|5.0|Finally! My favorite musical-comedy of all time is available on DVD. A MUST-SEE for anyone who likes musicals and black comedies.<BR>It's about Seymour Krelborn (played to perfecton by Rick Moranis) a nerdy loner working in a florist in downtown skidrow. He spends his time looking after a \\"strange and interesting\\" plant, a fly trap, that feeds on blood. When it grows and starts talking (with tremendous special effects)it brings him good fortune, yet Krelborn realizes he has to kill people to keep it alive.<br />This is one of my favorite films ever! The cast is outstanding, the music is brilliant and when the man-eating plant finds it's voice(thanks to great work by Levi Stubbs) the fun remains,despite sporadic horror.<br />The cast is brilliant. Rick Moranis is brilliant, Vincent Gardenia is excellent and Ellen Greene is a delight as the squeaky-voiced love interest of Krelborn . Watch out for a few surprise cameo roles too, including the late-great John Candy, James Belushi,Steve Martin and Christopher Guest. Keep a special look out for Bill Murray (one of the funniest men in America) in a hilarious role as a pain-loving patient for the sadistic dentist (played by the always funny Steve Martin)
B000060P79|5.0|This is a rad album and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs something to put them in a better mood! The songs are fast-paced and energetic and the lyrics are very clever. Most of the songs aren't too emotionally deep but, &quot;I'll Meet You There,&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot; more than make up for it! All of the songs could be singles. These Canadians rock, they really stand out from the rest! Gr8, keep up the good work! Buy it, you won't regret it!

Tim Curry brings this wonderful tale to LIFE!  His reading is superb and for the first time in my life I know the meaning of the term \\"spine-tingling\\".  When he read the end I could feel the little hairs on the back of my neck and a chill rise up my spine.

B00003CX5P|2.0|It's taken a good number of years to arrive at a final opinion about \\"Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\".  After vacillating between the good and bad of the movie, it is my final opinion that \\"Phantom Menace\\" is a tremendously disappointing movie that not only is aggravating to watch in its own right, but also heavily damages epic scope and mythos of the original trilogy.  This movie still warrants two stars because there are still some excellent visual scenes and it is Star Wars, but this is too much of a letdown to recommend to anyone.  <BR><BR>While it is true that no movie could live up to pre-release hype generated by the George Lucas hype machine and 16 years of anticipation, \\"Phantom Menace\\" fails on its own merits.  Where, exactly, does it go wrong?  Well, the first obvious problem is the acting.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are excellent actors in their own right.  Yet, there performances as Qui-Gonn Jin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, respectively, are wooden at best.  Obi-Wan seems like he's around just to remind people of the earlier trilogy.  He does very little and carries none of the presence he did in \\"A New Hope\\".  The computer-generated character of Jar-Jar Binks was gross miscalculation by Lucas.  Jar-Jar comes across as nothing more than an attempt to pander to a younger audience (which he did successfully with the Ewoks in \\"Return of Jedi\\" without hurting the movie), while aggravating the older core of Star Wars fans.  When a character utters lines that sound like they're from Stephanie Tanner from \\"Full House\\", you know there's a problem.  However, the biggest acting disaster the performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker.  Young kids are capable of acting (see Haley Joel Osment for example).  Jake Lloyd is not one of those kids.  All of his lines come across as incredibly forced and incredibly whiny.  Some of his scenes are so cringe-inducing that I had to turn away from the screen when they happened.  <BR><BR>Acting, alone, is not the only place \\"Phantom Menace\\" went wrong.  It seems that Lucas lost his understanding of the intangible elements that made the original trilogy to special and magical.  The climatic scenes in a \\"Phantom Menace\\" are nothing more than a rehash of the climatic scenes from \\"Return of the Jedi\\".  There's a space battle scene that includes the 'out-running the ball of fire' sequence from \\"Jedi\\".  Yet this scene is decidedly indistinct and lacking in drama.  There's a ground battle scene that pales in comparison to its \\"Jedi\\" counterpart, and there's a lightsaber battle that, while more technically proficient than the Luke/Vader showdown in \\"Jedi\\", it carries none of the importance or emotion.  Luke was fighting for his father's soul.  Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan's battle with Darth Maul seems perfunctory and without significant meaning.  This was all done so much better in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" and yet it seems as though Lucas thought he could recapture that amazement by simply recopying the elements. <BR><BR><BR>Alas, it gets worse.  Lucas also made some extremely questionable plot choices in \\"Phantom Menace\\".  One of the more aggravating ones was to give the 'Force' and biological basis in the form of midi-cholorians.  In the original trilogy, the 'Force' seemed like a mysterious, magical energy field that influenced all there was in the universe.  Here, it seems like a simple biological anomaly that can be easily tracked and understood.  This really damages the mythology of the 'Force'.  Another bad plot twist was making it so that Anakin was the creator of C-3PO.  This seems incomprehensible in the original trilogy and appears to be thrown in to make everything more convenient than it should be.  The final ludicrous plot development was the suggestion of Anakin being of a virgin birth.  Implying that he is a Jesus-like character is equally as offensive as the 'slave-language' of Jar-Jar and the stereotypical Asian accents of the Trade Federation.  <BR><BR><BR>The timeline of events also doesn't mesh particularly well with the original trilogy.  It all feels like it fits together in fashion that is too neat and tidy.  The magic of the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy was created as much from what we didn't know and learned from conjecture versus what we did know.  With the prequels, Lucas chose to answer a number of questions about Star Wars past that were better off left unanswered.
1563899426|5.0|I really liked this book and I was very excited when I got it. It was so good I even did a book report on it. The book takes old ideas about fairy tales and flips them upside down giving them a very realistic spin. I highly enjoyed the book and thought the art was lovely and I recommend it to anyone in 13 or older.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Time after time, a band gets popular with a certain style and then becomes afraid to make changes.  Linkin Park could have easily made an exact copy of Hybrid Theory and the album would have sold millions.  However, the band did not take the easy road and the fans reap the benefits.<br />Meteora represents true progress on the musical style of Hybrid Theory.  Meteora still sounds like LP, but they took some chances and expanded the sound.  The new disc may not grab you right away like Hybrid did, but repeat listenings will reveal the depth and texture in the music.  &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is a great first single because it contains all of the classic LP sounds.  As for the rest, almost every song could be released as a single.  Here are my pics:  Faint (best track on the CD, adds some stings to a fast song, has a sense of urgency), Breaking the Habit (sounds like the best song Depeche Mode never wrote, no rapping, great samples), From the Inside (classic hard-soft dynamic), and Numb (last track but one of the best, very fluid song).<br />Linkin Park proves with Meteora that they are here to stay.  Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is an excellent film! I am not one to look for movies about old men on John Deer Tractors, BUT this movie is moving! The best part about this film is the beautiful music and scenery! I never thought I would find wheat fields beautiful, but this changed my mind.

The man is Robby Deniro and he's well connected as always in these films and THE MAN gives him the chance to run a casino. This movie has it all and for the fans of Scorcese and the mafia, con-artist genre then this is one movie you should pick up!

This movie is totally mesmerizing and the characters are absolutely injected with life making the viewer fall in love or hate the characters involved in the plot. This movie is good in the way how 'the dude' tries to just get his carpet back but does as screwed up as his life already is. This movie is a total classic!
B000002KKC|3.0|Purists, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid it's true: on the whole CD's do sound better than vinyl LP's. But there are always exceptions to every rule, and Fleetwood Mac's 1979 album &quot;Tusk&quot; is definitely one of those exceptions.<br />The original LP release of &quot;Tusk&quot; was a formidable product indeed. It came with plenty of absorbing band photography, two brilliant murals, all housed in an innovative cover. Furthermore, the vinyl pressings couldn't have been any better. As this was a double album no more than 76 minutes in length, the masterer had plenty of space to lay down deep grooves in the original vinyl, which gave &quot;Tusk&quot; an unusually rich and full sound quality. Surely then, given that the vinyl sounded so good, it could be expected that the subsequent CD reissue would also be of equally high quality?<br />But alas. The current CD version of &quot;Tusk&quot; is by and large a dismal failure. Let's start with the music: Mr Buckingham, it seems, was unable to resist the urge to tinker with the original album mixes when the CD was put together. I suspect that almost all of Lindsay's songs on the CD have been sanded down to make them sound inoffensive. This is particularly true for &quot;I Know I'm Not Wrong&quot; where some sterile vocal harmonies have been pushed up in the mix while all the brilliant guitar harmonics that distinguished the track have been buried. But what is even more puzzling is the edit of &quot;Sara&quot;. All 76 minutes of &quot;Tusk&quot; can quite easily fit onto one CD, so why have we been given a truncated four minute version? Sure - the seamless edited version certainly demonstrates Lindsay's studio wizardry, but the listener is left feeling short-changed.<br />And then there is the CD packaging. The colour photography is reduced to black and white, and the murals are not reproduced. However, the CD does improve on the original vinyl by including the lyrics and some brief liner notes, but even the latter are inaccurate: (apparently Fleetwood Mac had two musicians known as Bob Welsh and Danny Kirwin).<br />You think I am nitpicking? Well perhaps, but it's just that &quot;Tusk&quot; is my favourite Fleetwood Mac album. &quot;Tusk&quot; was released at the height of the band's popularity and it deserved a much better quality package than this shoddy reissue. <br />So much for the quality, what about the music itself? &quot;Tusk&quot; was the follow-up to 1977's &quot;Rumours&quot; which sold in stratospheric amounts, making the Mac arguably the biggest rock act in the world in the late 1970's. Fleetwood Mac have been criticised by some as putting out bland, corporate LA-rock, but they have obviously not heard &quot;Tusk&quot;. Instead of simply pleasing their record company by retreading &quot;Rumours&quot; Fleetwood Mac put out a highly experimental follow-up album. Lindsay Buckingham's material, in particular, was quite freakish. &quot;The Ledge&quot;, &quot;What Makes You Think You're The One&quot; and &quot;That's Enough For Me&quot; were, if not exactly punk, then certainly punk influenced, while the title track, recorded live in Dodger Stadium with a marching band, opened up new musical possibilities for the group.<br />Stevie Nicks' songwriting also continued to develop in leaps and bounds. &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot; were Stevie's finest songs yet, and they hinted at the direction her subsequent solo career would take in the 1980's. Meanwhile, Christine McVie was her usual, reliable self, turning in pop gems such as &quot;Over and Over&quot; and &quot;Think About Me&quot;, as so were Mick and John, who soldiered on with good humour.<br />Perhaps my only criticism of &quot;Tusk&quot; is that its sound lacks the unity of Fleetwood Mac's previous efforts. It's almost as if the three songwriters had taken tracks from intended solo albums and mixed them all together to form &quot;Tusk&quot;. But whatever the shortcomings, &quot;Tusk&quot; certainly demonstrated that Fleetwood Mac were not prepared to become a cash cow for Warner Brothers, and that they would continue to experiment and explore, whatever the consequences.<br />In 2004, Tusk will celebrate its 25th anniversary - and let's hope that Mick Fleetwood will commemorate the occasion by giving &quot;Tusk&quot; the kind of reissue it deserves, with the original mix intact. In the meantime, head on down to your local second-hand store and hunt out a good quality vinyl copy of &quot;Tusk&quot;. You'll be glad you did.<br />Also worth checking out: the Santa Cruz 80's alternative band Camper Van Beethoven recently released a quirky cover of &quot;Tusk&quot;. That's right - a cover of the entire album! It's well worth a listen.

B00005ATQD|4.0|EYES WIDE SHUT contains considerable nudity, several fairly explicit scenes, and one sexual situation after another. But any one who approaches EYES WIDE SHUT with the idea that it will be sexually arousing is in for an extremely rude awakening. EYES WIDE SHUT is not a sexy film, and (Hollywood marketing men aside) no one in their right mind would describe it as such.<br />The story is intriguing.  Upscale New York doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) fall into a drug-laced conversation--and goaded by Bill's rather archaic ideas about female sexuality, Alice reveals that she has had a powerful sexual fantasy about a man she once saw in a hotel.  Powerful though the fantasy was, the facts of the matter are much more prosaic: she never spoke to him, never had sex with him, and never saw him again.  But the authority with which she describes the fantasy, and the realization that women in general and his wife in particular are capable of contemplating such behavior, sends Bill into an emotional spin.  Unable to shake the image of his wife having sex with another man, he prowls the city--and wanders more by accident than design into one sexual situation after another.  Accosted by a patient, taunted by drunk men on the street who think he is gay, and even picked up by a prostitute, Bill eventually stumbles into the film's centerpeice: a secret society that gathers for cold-blooded and ritualistic fornication.  And once he trespasses upon the society, he suddenly finds that death and destruction follow his every move.<br />There are clearly several metaphors at work in the film.  EYES WIDE SHUT essentially presents sex as something that boils under the surface with a ferocity of which we are generally unaware--and then by stages ties sexuality to emotional risk, disease, perversion, cruelty, and ultimately death.  It is also flatly Strindbergian in its vision of women, presenting them and their sexuality as irrational elements that must be subdued and reduced to the mechanical lest they lead to absolute destruction.  And it is no accident that the story is set at Christmas with its story of a male God born of a virgin woman.<br />But these are only the most obvious of the film's layers.  What confuses--and often enrages--viewers is the fact that Kubrick leaves a tremendous amount of wiggle room when it comes to both the story and what it means.  There is no clear-cut summation re anything: everything is presented in the most ambivilent manner possible and we are left to draw our own conclusions.  And this is as true of the plot as it is of whatever intepretation you attach to it; it winds back upon itself, ultimately frustrating any clear-cut response.  One might say that with EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick tantalizes us with a secret that he keeps entirely too well.  I like the film, but people tend to have extremely divided reactions to it, and for that reason I recommend that you rent the film and decide for yourself before making a purchase.<br />In theatrical release, EYES WIDE SHUT was presented in a widescreen ratio; on both VHS and DVD release, however, it is presented in the ratio of a standard television screen.  Liner notes indicate that Kubrick intended the film to be seen in that ratio--but even if that is true it is a pity that there is not a widescreen option, for the visual statement of the widescreen theatrical release was somewhat more powerful.  If you are trying to decide between DVD and VHS and both price and DVD bonus materials are factors in your choice, you should know that there is no significant difference between the two.<br />--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--ubdued and reduced to the mechanical lest they lead to absolute destruction.

B000007T1M|5.0|Is it just me or when Rick Rubin hears a band play he probably hears these little voices telling him that if he produces their record they will be globally recognized for their talent. I'm talking about his part in the creation of Hip-Hop, finding faith no more and red hot chili peppers and now... System of a Down. This album has only 2 songs I did not really like but the rest of the album is done very nicely. They sort of combine heavy metal with a bit of arabic riffage on the guitars making a real good fast paced playin' band. The lead singer has a voice you just have to hear on the album for yourself. A good rock album that you can leave the whole thing playing.
B000089A07|1.0|Attention Hollywood. Stop remaking movies that are already good i.e. Psycho(1998) and Red Dragon(2002) formerly known as Manhunter. This movie was slow and boring. Ralph Fiennes failed miserably measuring up to Tom Noonan's performance as Francis Dolarhyde and in this go around Anthony Hopkins is outperformed by Brian Cox's previous portrayal of Hannibal. The film had no sense of urgency or suspense like Manhunter had. The cast even \\"acted\\" like they had a case of deja vu (hasen't this story been told once before?) Granted having seen Manhunter I knew what the story was so there were no real surprises. but at least give it the college try for entertainment. It even failed there. Avoid this movie at all costs. If I could give this movie zero stars I would. Do yourself a favor and watch Manhunter.

B000050FEN|5.0|I was caught totally off guard when I saw this for the first time.  This is not your average cop chases killer, cop catches killer, killer dies movie.  It breaks all the rules from start to finish.  This is one of the few movies that make you squirm in your seat with what it does not show you.  Suspense and a forboding sense of doom takes ahold of you during the beginning credits and do not let go.  Not for the faint of heart.  Kevin Spacey deserved an Academy Award for his portrayal of John Doe.  He played the type of killer that would have Hannibal Lector looking over his shoulder.

B00008H2LB|5.0|I was very impressed with Linkin Park's latest album, Meteora. Certainly from what you've probably already read from other reviews, Meteora has a lot of the same elements as Hybrid Theory, their first album, did. Still, the songs are all new, so if you're getting a bit bored by Hybrid Theory (even that gets boring after about 40 times around, hehe) then get Meteora, because it's the perfect continuation. Most songs have the same Hybrid Theory feel to them, inlcuding &quot;Don't Stay&quot;, &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot;, &quot;Lying from You&quot;, and &quot;Numb&quot;. But some songs had a refreshingly original style that was still Linkin Park but different, such as &quot;Easier to Run&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, and, my personal favorite (which for some reason keeps going unmentioned in other reviews) &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;. This latter combines an eerie japanes flute with hip-hop beats and rapping for an overall effect that's hard to describe but shouldn't be missed.<br />Overall this is a great album and you'll probably find youreself listening to it 3-4 times in a row! Well' that's actually because of one of its cons, namely that its only a 40-minute CD and time flies when you're having fun...<BR>Now, this CD is not as perfect as Hybrid Theory, but it retains a solid formula that I love so much, and also tries some new types of fongs for an overall excellent album that well deserves 5 stars. Of course Hybrid Theory would've deserved 6!
0060934913|3.0|Half expose, half memoir Kitchen Confidential is filled with enough hard boiled, macho commentary that it comes across as written by Mickey Spillane. Bourdain pulls no punches here; (if you go to a brunch after this you're probably a daredevil)his world of cooking is one of violence, long hours, drugs and alcohol, and more than enough enough testosterone. It's the constant machismo that wears thin after a while, when Bourdain is on target (\\"A Day in the Life\\" will actually get your heart racing) this book is as good as it gets, but for every great section you have another like \\"The Level of Discourse\\" which reads like a discarded George Carlin bit. This balances out to an intriguing but basically flawed work, well-worth reading but the parts do not form a satisfying whole.
B000005GYI|5.0|i can't really add much to the former reviews,because they are dead on. this album may not have changed whole life, but it did add joy to at least two weeks of my life.pure joy... ... maybe this album did change my life. this coming from a guy who hates &quot;world music&quot; and thrives on indie rock.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Critics and fans alike initially said that &quot;Sea Change&quot; was too sad, too bitter, too plodding to be a Beck album.  In other words, Beck hadn't given the audience what it had expected.  Those criticisms highlighted Beck's best virtue:  he is unpredictable.  That and his extraordinary musical talent make &quot;Sea Change&quot; a great CD.<br />Beck's emotional pain is evident throughout the LP, but so is his sense of perspective.  Sure, he mourns his relationship (&quot;Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot;) and expresses his bitterness (&quot;Paper Tiger&quot;).  But he blends these raw emotions with a sense of acceptance and maturity, as in &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot; and &quot;End of the Day.&quot;  While he acknowledges his feelings of loss, he understands the futility of living in the past (&quot;you owe nothing to the past but wasted time/to serve a sentence that was only in your mind&quot;).  It's this interplay of emotions that make this a fully-formed album:  not too bitter, not too sweet, but just right.  The fact that the LP is exquisitely produced also helps its cause.<br />Just as great artists/act such as Prince, Stevie Wonder, De La Soul and Me'shell N'degeocello, Beck defies expectations thrust upon him with &quot;Sea Change.&quot;  It is a very enjoyable set.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Ah yes, Meteora, the new album from the promising band of Linkin Park. Got this CD the day it came out because i enjoyed hybrid theory so much, despite my taste for heavier bands such as pantera. anyway, i feel that this album falls short of many people's expectation and anticipation for a new linkin park album. after nearly two years without a new single or cd linkin park seemed to just be remixing their old hits on hybrid theory on the release reanimation. this in my opinion, was a nightmare. anyway, moving onto the release of meteora. first thing that hit me when i popped with cd in was a track of total b.s. noises done by the \\"genious\\" mr. hahn. LP seemed to go in a newer, softer direction with this one. for those of you who enjoyed LP's teen angst screaming, heavy slam riffs and fierce, fast paced songs, this one isn't for you. there are some amazing releases on this album such as the catchy \\"somewhere i belong\\" and \\"faint\\". one thing that bothered me about this album is that many of the songs sound exactlly the same, or the same as songs on hybrid theory. \\"From The Inside\\" sounds disturbingly like \\"In The End.\\" And how long does the amazing splender of this groundbreaking, highly anticipated cd last?...A WHOPPING 36 MINUTES!!! if you're a big fan of LP, definately pick this one up, you wont be sorry, i myself am a little dissappointed in this record. but hey, all around it's pretty good listening. perhaps this is the beginning of a new more \\"mature\\" sound for LP, only time will tell...hopefully it wont take them another 2 years for their next studio release :)
B00005QG9J|1.0|I am sorry to say but this is by far the worst incubus album. They seem to be living of the pattern of Drive and ignore what really made them special. Their funk roots from their Previous albums like Fungus Amoungus, Enjoy Incubus and ever Make Yourself have almost toatally been left behind. In fact i would call this an album for love starved 14 year old girls.<BR>Weak incubus Weak.
0380002930|5.0|To be strictly honest, I must say that when I first started reading Watership Down, I braced myself for a boring, dragging story about some rabbits. However, 2 chapters into the book and I was hooked. For the two and a half hours it took to read straight through it, I forgot food, sleep, and my own humanity. I became engrossed with the lives Richard Adams created for these rabbits: their culture, their deities, and most of all, their struggle for life and survival. This book contains all a fantasy could ask for: a mystic that sees the future, a strong capable leader with the brains, and a strong capable leader with the brawn. It also has a fast-paced, action filled plot; keeping the reader constantly wondering what will happen next. The book opens in a large thriving community of rabbits, called the Sandleford warren. Fiver, the mystic, has a terrible vision of destruction heading for their home. Being undersized and thought insignificant, his brother, Hazel goes to speak for him. Naturally, they are not believed and are almost arrested. To escape the impending doom, a small group of rabbits leave the warren and embark on a journey to find a new home. On the way they meet friends, enemies, havens and hell. Who knew the lives of animals could be so interesting? Meet the strange rabbits whose nature has been twisted and deformed, a sadistic dictator who knows no reason, and hold your breath as the rabbits brush with death several times. See the human world through the eyes of animals; discover what our cars, actions, and even our cigarettes mean to them! I admit you might feel at first, disinclined to pick this book up, but once you're done, you will reap its rewards.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|It was great to finally get this album here in Australia. I have the Russian version so couldnt wait to listen to this. Overall, its a great package, a bit of everything for everyone. The selection fo songs is great, nothing repetitive. The enhanced section is a good bonus, especially the Part 2 Video with the interview. All the things she said was a good choice for Single No. 1 and Not Gonna Get Us is a superb follow up. Single No.2 comes out here this week so it will great to see if a video clip is attached to the single. One of the best new acts, if not the best of 2003 so far, a fine package and a supprise that it came out of Russia! Hopefully the followup album will be just as good, if not better!
B000066NW0|5.0|First off, I would just like to say that I got this a week after it's release. (I usually buy big selling CD's after it becomes popular.) I saw Avril's talent in the song COMPLICATED. The CD starts off with a bang on the quasi-Alanis Morissette influenced song LOSING GRIP where Avril asks herself \\"Why should I care? cuz you weren't there when I was scared, I was so alone.\\" The CD then gives out three more hits with COMPLICATED, SK8ER BOI, and I'M WITH YOU. Complicated is one of my favorite tracks on the CD, and Sk8er Boi I probably could live without, it's just OK. But I'm With You was one of my favorites right when I heard it. I waited FOREVER for it to be released as a single, and I was so glad when it finally was. The next song, MOBILE, is also one of my favorites. The next track (UNWANTED) is kind of along the lines of Losing Grip, and Avril takes a stab with \\"You don't know me, don't ignore me, if you had your way you'd just shut me out... make me go away.\\" The CD from there is pretty mellow. It's easy riding from there on with more possible hits like MY WORLD (which I soooo want to be released as a single) and THINGS I'LL NEVER SAY (which is also a great song). All of the other songs are good, too. So I would REALLY reccomend this CD to anyone! It even surprised me how many people at my school have and enjoy this album as much as I do! Chances are, you'll really like this CD. If not, you'll at least find like 3 songs that you enjoy a lot. This is a GREAT buy! If you don't already have it... (why would you not?!?!) ...BUY IT! I highly reccomend it to all. ENJOY! (I know I sure did!!!!!)
630460291X|1.0|I love this movie, but WHY do you have to turn the DVD over part way through?  That stinks.  What were they thinking when they made it? <br />Stick to the VHS....
B00005NGZX|5.0|... Its fast paced and brutal as Hell, twelve tracks of insanity! Awesome vocals crazy guitars and drums. <br />Their best work by far! I cant wait for their new album, You Fail Me due out this year. I hear its better then this. And that is just mind blowing. <br />If you're a fan of hardcore then check this out. Its one of the best albums I own. You'll agree with me when you listen to it!
B000089RVX|5.0|Every single song on this album rocks! You should take a listen to each one and you will know why this will be the hottest new rock band. Their 2 songs on Daredevil just exposed them to the mainstream but they have always rocked. Buy this CD now!
0783889836|5.0|I think Mr.Bowden really know how to describe/analysis the truth he collected.<BR>No matter the goods ones or the bad ones.<br />In this book you will gain some basic knowledge about Somalia.<BR>The mess inside the country and U.N`s weak involvement.<BR>Then why those bad boys came down there to solve the problem.<br />You could also share the feelings of those young warriors.<BR>The Professional D-Boys and Young Rangers fought for the men next to them.<BR>The crazy firefight just presents/proves their bravery.<br />A guy in Economist posted a childish criticism about US government gave medals to those who fought down there instead of court-marshal them with war crimes.<br />I think he really needs to read this book, or go to the front line on his own!!!<br />May God Bless those who fought for us in Afganistan and Iraq!!!
B000063COX|5.0|This is the beginning. Before Iron Maiden came along with their melodic guitar riffs, fast solos, nice album covers, metal was Black Sabbath. But these guys from East side London defined a sound that would be unmistakable to any heavy metal fan. <BR>Paul Di'Anno was not the best lead singer for Iron Maiden, but &quot;the song remains&quot; and after getting Bruce Dickinson on vocals the band really took off.<br />Iron Maiden will never write a hit song. But their love of music will make them create some of the most interesting albums during the 80's and 90's.
B0000027RL|1.0|Can't help but think about toliet paper when a song of theirs comes on...they do play to the media...it's their style...it gives them &quot;hits.&quot;  Listen to the Clash for the real thing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead gave a new definition to music with &quot;OK Computer&quot;. This album is just beautiful, filled with songs that speak directly into your head. Amazing lyrics, great guitar work, blends of different sounds all across the album, resulting in a very nice addition to anyone's CD collection.<br />Thom Yorke once again shows that he has one of the most captivating male voices in rock music, and the band makes use of it to create some of the songs that will remain in your head after you hear the album, such as &quot;Let Down&quot; or &quot;No Surprises&quot;.<br />If you haven't heard Radiohead before, start here and then trace back to the first albums.
B000002KN8|5.0|Have a cup of coffee, watch the world go by, and enjoy the tunes with this cd.  They were the &quot;new ones&quot; you know.<br />It's sparks art.  How can you deny this listeners?
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is one of the best motion picture soundtracks I have EVER heard.<br />The movie is easily one of my FAVORITE ones, and this CD is the perfect addition to any Chicago-Lover's collection.<br />All of the songs have great beats, catchy lyrics, and an overall greatness.<br />This CD captures the exact feeling you get when you see the movie.<br />I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys great music.
B00005JGAF|5.0|The best thing I can say about this record is that it is so eminently danceable, beginning with \\"Cretin Hop.\\"  This album is chock full of good, fun, songs, that hailed from a time when punk was still tongue-in-cheek enough not to take itself seriously as some kind of \\"social movement.\\"  <br />\\"Rockaway Beach\\" brings back memories of much of my childhood spent there.  It's the ultimate surfer song spoof, not about California, but the filthy beaches along the outer borough of Queens, on the rotting boardwalks...stepping on pop tabs in the sand, and swimming in diluted sewage. <br />\\"I Don't Care\\" is Joey's hepcat to British Invasion rock as he affects a limey cockney whine.  \\"We're a Happy Family\\" is reality radio a quarter century before the farce of \\"reality TV.\\"  Sort of a harbinger to the Bundys.<br />\\"Teenage Lobotomy\\" is also prescient, predicting almost word-for-word personages such as 'n'Sync and Backstreet Boys and their nubile, airheaded, fans.<br />However, the gem of this one is the bonus tracks \\"Needles and Pins\\" (a nice salute to the now late Sonny Bono, who wrote it, and who never knew what a great song he wrote until the Ramones put it down on wax) and the stripped down demo for \\"I Don't Care.\\"<br />This is my second favorite, right behind \\"Road to Ruin,\\" but about 10 of their albums can easily make that cut.<br />Joey and Dee Dee, your hard work and dedication to rock and having a good time have not been in vain.
B00005JM93|5.0|THERE IS no ESCAPE FROM THIS FILM!<BR>if you put the dvd in the player, you have to see it!<BR>if you like memento/i stand alone/combat shock/possession/trouble every day!<br />.... then you have to see this!<BR>and if you order all, then order at \\"amazon.fr\\" the box with both films irreversible and seul contre tous! including the soundtrack disc. in a great box-package!
B00005YW4H|5.0|After the first time I listened to this disc I wrote it off as being monotonous and I put it aside. Then for some reason two months later I decided to try it again. This time I put the headphones on and received the full scope of this engaging work of art. <BR>Norah has a quality in her voice which can not be described. She reaches in and grabs you and keeps you there. She has little Joni Mitchell, a little Carole King and a little Karen Carpenter in her vocal delivery. She is smooth, soulful, bluesy and an instantly recognizeable one of a kind.<BR>Her music is universal. She could have hit big in the 40's, the 70's or any decade with these exact same recordings. The songs transcend time and music genres.<BR>At first the album may seem to have a limited musical focus. Though after careful inspection of each song it becomes evident that there is a focus in several delightful diections. Some songs focus on the guitar, some the keyboard others percussion and some on Norah's voice itself.<br />Her rendition of Hank Williams' &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; is flawless and original. The song includes an irresistible bass line. Norah's vocal is bluesy and strong. The keyboard adds a wandering mood about it. Patsy Cline or kd lang would have also done justice to this tune. &quot;Seven Years&quot; speaks with a youthful innocense. The lyric is especially strong it gives an optimistic feel of youth and music. The guitar solo in the Norah Jones penned &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is superb, while &quot;I've Got To See You Again&quot; adds a certain mystery to the listeners ears. &quot;Lone Star&quot; is my favorite track on the album. It has a great combination of jazz influenced drum rhythms, laid back guitar chords and a smooth bass. This country flavored tune is done in Norah's impeccable but original style.<BR>Norah wrote three of the songs on the album and band member Jesse Harris also wrote several of the tunes.
B00005B36H|1.0|ok, ill give it one and a half...<BR>after reading all the reviews and all the 'buzz' i decided to purchase this album.<BR>very little of it is actually rocking heavy music(sabbath, zepplin)they have this unique sound they use throughout the album, but its like whats so great? the album is long and much of it is boring. im more into music than lyrics as i havent payed much attention to the lyrics-so i cant say anything about them. but the music is like, so what? theres a couple section where they do kind of bring the heavy guitars and rock. i like good acoustic type music but their slow, soft parts are soo boring-the musicianship seems bland.<BR>i havent even heard the whole album as parts get so long and boring that even if your doing something else the urge is to fast forward.<BR>i also bought the mahavishnu orchestras 'inner mounting flame'-now that is some original heavy 'rocking' music.
B00004VVND|5.0|back in 1973, hi tech sci fi  , was beginning to show up on the screen on a regular basis, although  a few weak moments are in the film, this sci0-fi gem is a must for collectors.<BR>i would imagine, a  up dated version would be great  and a re make would generate a new  fan base,  perhaps,  tom berringer<BR>as the cowboy-bad guy...a.k.a. yul brynners   role...
B00005RFAI|1.0|Please don't buy this CD...first off, it is very very ANNOYING! The beats are annoying, the singer is annoying, just everything about this is annoying! First off she complains about everything! Secondly she NEVER will be Britney Spears or Christina! And neither Britney or Christina aren't that good so why would she want to be one of them? Just a bit of advice save your money unless if you like to waste money on garbage! I'd give it no stars if I could...
0671027344|5.0|This book is one of the best books i have ever read.  It touched me more than i thought a book could ever do.  It shows more feeling and emotion than you could imagine.  It is my favorite book, period.
0425188809|5.0|I've enjoyed many of Koontz other novels but I felt a real kinship with Einstein in this book.  Being a pet lover is was refreshing to not only include a golden retriever as a central character in the book but the incredible ability he possessed truly let him come alive.  This story truly shows the impact our 4 legged friends can have on us.  Well worth the read!
0385504209|2.0|This is a very interesting book, but dangerous for people who are not very well read in real history.  I would advise people who read this book to remember this is fiction and purely fiction. I have read some reviewers who talk of the contents of this book as &quot;fact&quot;. It is purely the imagination of Dan Brown. As interesting as and clever as the book is , the premise behind the whole thing ( which i won't give away) ruined the experience for me. I am glad I read the book so I know what it really is about and where the author wants me to go. I just feel sorry that so many people think it is so great and are so quick to accept the version of history proposed by the book. I can only recommend this book for people who are well learned in history and who take the book for what it is, a suspenseful and clever piece of fiction, and not a true history . When reading this book the reader would be well advised to know the difference between fact and fiction. One final bone to pick with the author: Why pick Opus Dei? I mean, why pick on them?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|In my humble opinion, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; should have won an Oscar last year. It single-handedly revived musicals. It definitely opened the door for &quot;Chicago&quot; to win this year.<br />I was a little skeptical about seeing this movie in the beginning. I'm not a huge Nicole Kidman fan, and all my customers and employees at the video store were all giving me very negative reviews. However, my aunt said she wanted to see it, so I rented it for us one weekend.  It has fast become one of my top ten movies.<br />For those of you that have seen &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet,&quot; you're already aquainted with Baz Luhrmann's directing style. Flamboyant, no-hold's barred, breath-taking are only a couple of words I can use to describe it.<br />I've always liked Ewan McGregor. The boy can sing, as he's shown in &quot;Velvet Goldmine.&quot; This movie is Ewan at his best. Jim Broadbent definitely deserved the Oscar as Harold Ziedler. John Leguizamo steals the movie as the dwarf, Tuloose. Finally, Nicole Kidman gives the performance of a lifetime as Satine.<br />This movie is not JUST a musical. It has comedy, drama, action/adventure, suspense, EVERYTHING! So, if you've been on the fence, go ahead and make the jump over to the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;
B00005MP58|4.0|I will not repeat all of the praise given by other reviewers with regard to the acting, the screenplay, and the filming of this wonderful version of Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  I watched it under protest from my then-girlfriend/now-wife, and reluctantly became a major fan not only of this miniseries but also of Austen's books in general.  If that's not high praise I don't know what is. <br />As wonderful as this miniseries is, and as significant a success as it has been, it is rather astonishing to me that its producers would have shlocked together this &quot;Special Edition DVD&quot; in such a clumsy manner.  We actually own both the &quot;Special Edition&quot; and the older &quot;ordinary&quot; DVD version of this miniseries.  Here are the notable differences:<br />(1) The original DVD version displays the show in fullscreen 4:3 aspect ratio, precisely as it was televised in the United States.  The &quot;Special Edition&quot; displays the show in letterbox format.  Kudos for the &quot;Special Edition&quot;, it makes the staging of various shots more enjoyable to watch.<br />(2) The original DVD version merely pasted together all of the episodes to the miniseries.  In between episodes, the original DVD dutifully replayed all of the opening and closing credits in the places where a television viewer would have seen them.  The &quot;Special Edition&quot; removes all but the first and last credit rolls, allowing the viewer to be more immersed in the storyline.  Again, kudos for the Special Edition.<br />(3) The original version demonstrated vibrant colors, good exposure and contrast, and an all-around pleasant and detailed picture.  The &quot;Special Edition&quot; has dull, washed out colors with overexposed bright areas and underexposed dark areas in every scene.  For instance, during the first dance on disc one, Darcy's hair looks exactly the same as Darcy's shirt which looks exactly the same as the wood panelling on the wall behind him which looks exactly the same as Caroline's hair:  i.e., all of them are &quot;black&quot; with no internal detail whatsoever.  We have switched back and forth between the original/&quot;Special&quot; DVDs to verify, and the difference is unmistakeable and rather astonishing.  In this category, the &quot;original&quot; DVD wins hands-down.  <br />It's sad, really.  So close to releasing the definitive version of the show, and yet so far.  Maybe there will someday be a &quot;third&quot; release where the producers will finally get it all right.
0385504209|1.0|This book set my teeth on edge.  The anti-Christian types will love it.

B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's newest release gives what you got with \\"Awake\\", and builds on that. When you heard \\"I Stand Alone\\" off of \\"The Scorpion King\\" soundtrack, it gave you a taste of what was to come from the Boston-based hard rock/metal band. Heavier riffs, stronger lyrics, and an overall sense of evolution for them. Just from the opening track, the first single, \\"Straight Out Of Line\\", you can even tell that the once not-too-memorable solos have gotten greatly better. Godsmack's talent has grown into an even more powerful force than before.<br />Also, their new drummer, Shannon Larkin (formerly of Amen), proves his worth here with great & energetic pounding drum tracks. Sully's vocals are as great as ever as he tears the lyrics from the depths of his being. Anger, frustration, a building rage, and an overall intensity define his vocal stylings. Tony Rombola's guitar & Robbie Merrill's bass both bring a powerful, headbanging groove to the album.<br />Overall, I say this is Godsmack's best album yet. It's as heavy as \\"Awake\\", but even more polished & solid. I listened to the entire album, track-by-track, and I didn't have the urge to switch off one single song. It's a rare thing for that to happen, and I applaud these Boston bad @$$es for crafting such a strong, unified album. With two and a half years between the releases of \\"Awake\\" and \\"Faceless\\", they had the time to mold these 12 tracks into one helluva an awesome album!<br /><br />I would suggest getting the \\"Explicit\\" version or else you'll miss out on the full-on bad @$$-ity that is \\"I F'ing Hate You\\". Though, both the \\"explicit\\" and the \\"clean\\" versions are enhanced CDs that will take you to a special page on VooDooTribe.com to access the album lyrics (not included in the booklet), some live tracks, the fan club, and more.
0321127420|5.0|There is a good reason why this book scored 10/10 in a Slashdot review.  Fowler writes with such clarity and organization that even the most complex enterprise architecture concepts are handily broken apart into manageable chunks (patterns).  For instance, Fowler attacks the challenge of object-to-relational data mapping by breaking it into architecture, behavior, structure, and metadata patterns.  The result is a set of clearly defined, vendor-neutral, &quot;concept tools&quot; that the reader really knows when to use.  This book is to enterprise app design what the classic Gang-of-Four book is to OO design.
0671027344|4.0|In the realistic novel, \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\\" Stephen Chbosky shows you the life of a freshman in high school through the perspective of Charlie.  His unique style of writing, in journal entries, allows the book to be fun and easy to read.  The author talks about all the possible components, drugs, peer pressure, sex, and dealing with family and friends, which you would go through in high school.  There is no main story line, instead the author talks about many incidents that happen to Charlie and the people around him.<br />Charlie has internal and external struggles such as not trying to like Sam because she has a boyfriend and she told him in the beginning, which changes later on, that she did not see him in the same way. Peer Pressure in doing well in school and being as successful as his older brother, smoking to fit in or drinking at parties to be with the \\"in crowd\\".  These are all factors that each person goes through at one point or another and you have to make the choices.  Some of the incidents that happen throughout the book are, Charlie's friend Patrick is gay and Patrick can not be open about being a homosexual.  Patrick likes Brad, one of the popular students on the football team, and Brad dates Patrick for a little bit but Brad does it secretly. At one point Sam and her boyfriend, Craig, break up and that is devastating for Sam and for Charlie because he does not like to see Sam sad.  Charlie also goes out with Mary Elizabeth but he does not really like her and much more.  <br />Charlie learns to deal with all his problems and at the end of the book everything comes together.  The book wraps up similar to how the school year ends, with a few last-minute twists and closure.  The main point of this story is that even though you may have ups and downs in your life, in the end it all works out.
B00003IPFK|1.0|Lonesom Dove dragged on and on and on and on.........>  It's very dry, and even though Tommy Lee Jones and other well known stars appeared in it, it still was TERRIBLE. If you want to see a REAL western, watch Wyatt Earp (Lawrence Kasden) - NOW THERE'S A WESTERN!!

B00008H2LB|5.0|To all of those LP haters.... We all know your just jealous. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard, just as great as \\"Hybrid Theory\\". Every song makes total since to what people go through everyday, we need more great song writers like Chester and Mike...these guys are just awsome. All the songs rock and hold a special meaning to me personaly beacause I have been through stuff they talk about, I know I'm not alone. These guys will be my favorite band no matter what happens! I can't wait for the concert ... it's going to rock!!!!!!
B00005RYLE|4.0|This movie is incredible ... it is an incredible study on how to make a great movie on a shoestring budget.  The sound explosion in the new dts version is unbelievable.  However, pass on this one, and get the BOOK OF THE DEAD version -- best packaging ever
B0000035E7|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic and infinitely playable. A must for all Nirvana fans. I bought this album after listening to Nevermind and it is still my favourite. The guitars are much heavier than their later work (much more waa-waa pedal usage) and it is less polished but it has some of the greatest songs they ever released, including 'About a Girl' which became a hit for them much later. 'Negative Creep' and 'Love Buzz' are also worth buying the album for.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful collection -- the picture is fantastic, and the sound is what DTS was made for.  To hear the songs rendered in this exlosive 5.1 mix is unbelievable, and will make Apple Scruff's insatiable appetite even wetter awaiting all of the music to be released in this format.<br />If you are reading this, then you know what anthology is all about. What you have no idea how incredible the sound and picture are.  Get it!!
B00006RCNW|5.0|In the Shield, the latest cop show from FX, Vic Mackey played superbly by Michael Chiklis heads up a special task team comprised of four veteran cops who want to lower crime by any means they can. Supporting lone drugdealers, planting evidence, beating confessions out of suspects even killing another cop, are all part of the decisions they must make if they want to keep the streets safe.<BR>This show is unlike anyother on basic cable. The characters are not clearly labeled as good and evil they all act at times as both. You never can completely figure out the characters and thats what makes it so entertaining. An amazing supporting cast makes this the show to watch.<BR>The crimes and criminals depicted are accurate but Vic however is not. There is no cop out their like him. There are cops who are corrupt but not to the extent of the character or if they are they certainly do not remain functioning officers.... BUT<BR>That doesn't mean the show isn't fun to watch.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Another Album, Another Masterpiece. These guys have got it down. A lot of groups that are on their third album are exploring new sounds and alternative ideas thereby annoying their core audience in the process. If it aint broke don't fix it. Faceless holds true to the sound that made Godsmack's debut and Awake great albums, Rock and Roll, complete with a dying trend; Guitar solos. Did you ever notice todays music has forgotten the axe man in favor of a DJ or Power chords strummed to the beat. Sully and the gang are doing there best to keep Rock Alive. If you like Godsmack buy the album. If you forgot what guitar solos are buy it for a refresher course.
0553573403|5.0|Let me start by saying that a fantasy story set in a land with a perpetual or very long winter has always appealed to me.<br />That was the first reason I bought this one. That said, the book exceeded my expectations. All too often great fantasy stories follow a set plot: Little boy or girl, gets chased around,pursued by the evil one, develops his/her magic power/fighting prowess, comes back kills the evil one and gets the girl/boy as the case may be.<br />This is not that kind of story. After completing the book, I am still not sure who the villain is. (Except for the evil queen) Or even if there is a villain. All the characters'actions follow their motives and personalities, in a coherent fashion. The plot twists and turns, and keeps you guessing. After a while you realize that you really do not know how it will end. The story just absorbs you.<br />There is lust, violence and subtle eroticism; incest, treason, nobility and heroism. All the ingredients are there for a great series, and Martin weaves the characters and their motivations in a complex tapestry that really moves the story along.<br />A word about technique, each chapter is written from the point of view of one of the characters, and the chapter is named after the character, which helps keep you oriented.<br />A useful appendix is present at the end, which would be very useful had I read it before the story. Alas I had only the PDA download, so I did not know it. Also, if you get the PDA download, the maps are so small as to be useless.
0425170349|4.0|Rainbow Six being my first book read by Tom Clancy, I did not know what to expect at first.  The 700+ pages did not seem very appealing to me at first.  But to my surprise, it was an excellent ride.  As a lover of books that are fast paced, I was handsomely rewarded with this novel.  Rainbow Six talks about a counter-terrorist group called \\"Rainbow\\" going around the world trying to stop the terrorist incidents that were happening.  The \\"Rainbow\\" team ends up going against these nature loving \\"tree-huggers\\" extremists that want to destroy humanity to preserve the Earth.  Although the extremists described in the book seem far-fetched, is would be crazy if something would happen like that.  I would recommend Rainbow Six who likes action packed scenes and likes espionage type of books.  Lastly, I had one minor complain.  There was a little too much dialogue in the novel.  Other than that, Rainbow Six is a great book.
0971830509|2.0|well, chambers stories have a LOT of potential. he has quite an imagination. very original guy. and very different. he could have been truly weird. but he doesn't know when to stop. he can suddenly stretch the story too far in one direction, amazingly enogh: away from the horror. also he likes to include romance even when it doesn't fit. he has an anarchic style that destroys the stories.
B000089RVX|5.0|I think I have been searching for this sound for a long long time.  I heard Evanescence on the radio on the way home and detoured to the nearest music store and bought this.  My goodness, such clarity in the voice and the way the music just grabs you.  In the world of cookie cutter bands and singer, this is truly UNIQUE and it stands out like a beacon.  Not a disappointing track on the entire CD.  A brilliant sound and new era in rock and roll has just been born.  They truly understand how to start, bridge and end a song without the slightest let down.  It is just not the voice, but the musicians are TIGHT.  Run to buy this.  Can't wait to see them live.
B00004Z459|3.0|Look linkin park are a good band and that and they do have talent but....you have to admit they are overated and their songs are so alike that their forgettable, and i guess you think i don't own the album but i actually do, and yes when i first got it i would have given it 5 stars, but i guess as you grow up your music tastes mature. Any way thank god i didn't buy it, i just burnt it from a friend. Another thing im not to keen on in linkin park is the dj scratchings, like they depend on it too much and you would think they would be in a different genre to nu metal, like its ok to use a bit of scratchings but they use it over the limit for a nu metal band. Any way the lead singer also sounds very weak when he sings, and you could easily picture him in a pop band if you not include the bits where he screams. Overall linkin park is good, they just need cut down on the scratchings and be a bit more dark. Any way i do listen to this album once and a while and infact this album is one of my favourite albums to listen in the car. My personal favourite tracks on the album are &quot;in the end&quot; which is less rappy to their other stuff and more dark, i also like &quot;crawling&quot; which is their most aggresive song on the album and &quot;one step closer&quot; is a pretty aggresive track to, and i also liked &quot;run away&quot; which is a very slow song for linkin park.<BR>All in all great album, infact this album is probably best to be a first nu metal album for you if you've just gotten into rock, and they did win the best selling albums award last year so that shows how liked they are, but they are overated, so overall go buy it but do expect to get bored of it in a year. THANK YOU FOR READING-peace.

B00005QXDD|5.0|This is an excellent comedy album with many skits and songs. I also think the acoustic guitar accompanying the songs is cool. This album will make you jump when you hear \\"explosivo\\" and \\"lee\\", and it will make you relax on \\"f**k her gently and \\"double team\\", and every song is easily a laugh.<BR>Heres a run down on the track. The funniest songs are \\"f**k her gently*, *double team* and wonder boy*, and the funniset skits are *hard f**king*, *c**k pushups* and *drive thru*, though any way every track is licensed to thrill, and this is a most own for any comedy fan or anyone. This album has its spot next to <br />RODNEY RUDE: rude bastard<BR>BLOOD HOUND GANG: hooray for boobies<BR>AFROMAN: THE GOOD TIMES (i don't like rap but this guys funny)<BR>SYSTEM OF A DOWN: toxicity (their funny when they go insane)
B000060OFT|4.0|Romeo and Juliet continues to be my favorite of Shakespeare's dramatic works, and when I heard of this movie version I couldn't wait to see it.  I find that some parts of this adaptation are flashy and somewhat melodramatic, but this, by contrast, lends more purity and emotion to Romeo and Juliet's love.  The DVD is very well made.
0156012197|5.0|I understand now why this book is a classic!! This fable, along with Jay Singh's THE Butterfly and Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, is a must for anyone teetering on the tightrope of authenticity. It will give you the push you need to dive into yourself and be who you came here to be! But forget under a whole pile of \\"could haves\\" and \\"Should haves\\". If you or anyone you know needs a little push this is definitely the book to do it!
0380789035|4.0|In American Gods, Neil Gaiman has created a new mythology in which the old gods and the new gods battle for supremacy.  The story is intricate, the writing absorbing.  In the modern American setting, worship has taken on a new meaning.<br />The old gods have become less than godlike -- some are whiney or arrogant, even despondent, and they have lost many of the qualities that put their former worshipers in awe of them.  The new gods are less worshiped than they are part of everyday lives (e.g., the internet).  One has to wonder how many gods there are, and where they might find a place in the world of humans for whose attention they compete.<br />Gaiman's writing is always a joy and the worlds he creates are dark and intriguing.  In this work, however, so many threads are left dangling, so many paths end abruptly, adding little to the story.  Yet, once begun, the reader must finish this journey, even though the culmination might be clear early on.
B000065K6N|5.0|That's anime is not one of blood and violence, even if there is some in. It's more a tale of virtue and honor, where the hero is honnest and proud. It's nothing like you have ever seen! If you have seen Spirited Away and liked it, don't hesitate yet, and buy that great title. If you like animes that make you think, buy it now. If you like animes, buy it :) You won't be deceived!
B000006045|5.0|I haven't been into Massive Attack for too long, probably a couple of years now. &quot;Mezzanine&quot; was my very first MA album. I bought it because I heard nothing but good things about this group as well as this album. The rest is all history. I have their other three albums [&quot;Blue Lines&quot;, &quot;Protection&quot;, and &quot;100th Window&quot;]. I think of all the MA albums I own, &quot;Mezzanine&quot; resonates with me the most. The music is dark and foreboding, lyrically and musically. The cd starts off with the dark sounds of &quot;Angel&quot;. I particularly love that songs for the dark, slow, hip hop beats mixed with the haunting vocals. The choices in samples is astounding, if not refreshing. Normally I loathe the use of samples but Massive Attack is able to use samples and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intended. My personal favorite songs off &quot;Mezzanine&quot; has to be &quot;Man Next Door&quot; and &quot;Teardrop&quot;. Those songs are simply amazing. I recently put in &quot;Mezzanine&quot; into my cd player for the first time in months, and amazingly enough it still holds up very well in today's current music scene. I really think that &quot;Mezzanine&quot; set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music. It is one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two.
B00006GA4C|5.0|A mi me gustan todos los discos del GFR,cada uno tiene lo suyo pero este segundo disco tiene esa energa y ese poder que todo disco de rock debe expresar,sentirse.Esa guitarra de Mark Farner hechiza a cualquiera y no se diga de su excelente voz, el bajo de Mel Schacher es hipnotizante y  que decir de Don Brewer uno de los mejores bateristas del rock. Realmente no se porque pero en todas las revistas de rock por lo menos en las de espaol,nunca mencionan al Grand Funk como una de las grandes bandas que iniciaron el heavy metal, realmente merecen un gran crdito igual que Led Zeppelin,Black Sabbatt,etc,etc

B00005U2LM|1.0|I'm a huge Wu fan ( I even have the Playstation 'Shaolin Style' game) but This Wu-Tang album was complete garbage.  This was BY FAR their worst album.  If you think this album is better than 'The W' then you seriously need your head examined.  There's hardly any good songs and definitely NO CLASSIC SONGS on this joint.  The first problem is they let Masta Killa and U-God rap on the mic TOO MUCH.  Why did they let these lames rap so much?  There is minimal appearances from Ghostface Killah and Method Man, RZA raps too much on this album, absence of ODB, and the beats are SEVERELY LACKING, even with RZA producing some cuts the beats are weak.  The first single off the album ( and only single ) Uzi- Pinky Rings is incredibly lame.  I remember how dissappointed I was when I got this for christmas two years ago.  I had a long list of cd's I wanted but I put this down as a 'must have' and that's what I got.  And it was PURE WACKNESS.  I couldn't even bootleg the cd...nobody wanted it.  The only song worth anything would have to be 'One Of These Days\\" and it's not THAT good.  If you have this try to sell it and if you thinking about getting this cd keep on thinking.  A Huge disappointment.  I never thought I would do this to the Legendary Wu Tang Clan but this album receives ZERO stars.  Awful.

B00008H2LB|3.0|Pop bands like Linkin Park don't really have what are considered to be 'fans' but rather an 'audience.'  And apparently the fact that this band is afraid to take another step foward has upset the vast majority.  Aside from the short length of the CD which has nothing to do with quality of music, Linkin Park have cloned and tweaked prior hits in an attempt to recapture the magic of their first CD.<br />The major accusation centers around \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" which sounds alot like \\"In The End,\\" especially in lyrics and overall song composition.  Lyrically, both songs even start the same way (\\"When this began..\\"/\\"It starts with..\\").  Does it work?  Sure, why not?  Usually from CD to CD, the artist progresses and experiments with new things..  Linkin' Park's second CD is simply an extension of the first.  They really haven't gone to any real lengths to progress musically.  It works..  their first CD has so much popularity that it's really not too much of a disappointment, but still it is.<br />What can you expect though?  The hype of a 'follow-up' album always has artists sweatting bullets.  And with the commercial success the first album attained?  People expected more out of this album, but it's apparent that Linkin Park wasn't ready to explode with new material just yet.  Perhaps in their next CD we will see new song composition when they have nothing to copy from this CD, and the old one has already been duplicated.
0385503954|4.0|I would rate this 3.5 stars, but cannot. Three is unworthy, but four almost too much - so I err on the side of &quot;can't put it down no matter how boring this paragraph may be&quot;. I read this book as it was recommended from lists of other books I've enjoyed.  Jeez, what a chore to get started.  I thought I had chosen a book beyond my comprehension at first.  It was difficult to get the &quot;feel&quot; of the author (this was my first of McEwan's novels).  Maybe because I am American???  But after getting through the first 30 pages or so, things got interesting.  This is an unusual story of an obscure event, witnessed by a child, whose misinterpretation affects the lives of all involved -- including herself.  A great story that spans a lifetime and is told from several different points of view.  Be prepared to switch narrators several times.  From a young child's perspective, to the horrific times of war, this novel will make you yearn for more answers.  You will be left wondering what happened in between.  But that can be a good thing -- thus, four stars.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Forget about the likes of Kid Rock and Eminem. That's essentially what this album does. It makes those Detroit white boys irrelevant because they just don't get it.<BR>Here on Elephant Jack White connects with the &quot;black&quot; sound of what the Violent Femmes called American Music in a way that has been scarcely heard on record in ages.<BR>This record takes you on a journey of the last 50 years or so of the American experience. It jangles with the blues. It's the second coming of Hendrix in places. It's late 1960s garage rock and roll. <BR>Unlike many of the great British rock masterpieces we as Americans bow down to, this is truely our own - interestingly recorded on their soil. <BR>I've only listened to this for a few days now, yet I understand how much care went into constructing this album. That's why it's so great. It's art. It comes from two people who know and have experienced the deeper roots of American culture and have sent it back to us.<BR>This is American music. And I like American music. Don't you like American music too? Baby...
0446310786|5.0|This is my all time favorite American Classic.  I read it back in high school and loved it.  But it was only recently when a friend of mine started talking about this being his favorite book, that I re-read it and truly appreciated it even more so.  It is now in my bookcase with other American Classics waiting to be read again, and hopefully by my children when they are older.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Born in Mexico in 1907 just prior to the beginning of the Mexican revolution, Frida Kahlo becomes an icon in the art world after being confined to her bed and forced to find an outlet from what must have been inconceivable pain and torture.  She marries (twice) the famous muralist Diego Rivera who is played by Fred Molina--Rivera is best known for in the US for painting a mural for Rockafeller and having it torn down because he refused to take the image of Stalin out.  At 6 Frida had been diagnosed with polio and suffered from a slightly malformed leg throughout her physically tortured life.  Later, at around 17, she is in a city bus accident and a metal rod found its way through her abdomen and exited via the pelvic region.  Because of all this Frida is at the mercy of well meaning surgeons throughout her life and suffers body casts, odd traction devices and surgeries which in that day might have seemed helpful.  While being confined to her bed Frida's parents supply her with paint and canvas.  That is where the history of Frida's art and the thick of the movie begins.<br />  Selma Hayek plays the part of Frida Kahlo from youth to death.  Sparsed in between the performances are hallucinogenic scenes which masterfully depict some of her more abstract representations.  Although I felt the performances forced it did flow better during the 2nd half of the movie.  In addition to the physical suffering she endured Frida also endured Rivera--she said there were two great accidents in her life and one of them was Diego.  I wondered if the movie would depict much of the suffering Frida went through and that it does probably because Hayek produced the film herself.  It also characterizes her (Frida) ideas of transmutation of sorts as it ran in her life as well.  Perhaps the picture could have been aided by more attention to performance as I was left unconvinced in several places.  I do believe Miss Hayek tried to convey Frida's lust for any joy in life and living it for its very base values.  As the end approached I saddened knowing that this colorful, exuberant person had already passed years ago but was leaving again in a darkened theatre.  Some people describe Frida's art as disturbing but once you see it from her perspective it changes into something very familiar to all of us.<br />  If you enjoy music from the Mexican culture I highly recommend the sound-track.  Even though I didn't understand many words the emotional addition of the music turned stoic scenes into moving resonation's.s very base values.

B000089RVX|3.0|that one song on the daredevil soundtrack was perhaps the most dissapointing song on the record. All the others songs are great. catchy chords, grooving drum beats. Amy does indeed have a beautiful voice but it was covered by that rapper from 12 stones. seems like the record label was trying to sell evanescence off as another Nu- Metal band. Something evanescence DOES NOT NEED!  (no offence to the rapper). I found their sound a bit unoriginal the cd isn't bad! if you are looking for a similar sound check out-[local website]
B00005QW5X|5.0|Not since Tommy (1975) have I seen such the rock and roll (or perhaps Punk and Roll) drama.  John Cameron Mitchell plays Hedwig (Head-vig) who lives in East Berlin before the wall fell.  In order to get out of Berlin he is talked into a gender changing operation so that he can marry a military man and move to the US.  Needless to say the operation goes awry and the Berlin wall falls shortly after he leaves.  As if it could get no worse the music that he writes and performs is stolen by his protege Tommy Gnosis who becomes rich and famous.  Hedwig and his band (The Angry Inch -- see operation) shadow Gnosis at all his gigs trying to get back the recognition they deserve.  The comedic moments are filled with slight bitter afterbite as Hedwig searches desperately for his other half.  He finds that when he strips everything down to the very core that he has truly found his other half and no amount of lovers, fame, fortune, and Farrah Fawcett wings will make any difference.  The music was excellent so if you don't catch the movie you should find the web site and grab the MP3's.  The best song &quot;Origin of Love&quot; is sadly not there.  I rented this movie on VHS but I'd recommend it in letterbox on DVD.  Blockbuster is the only video store I know that has it in that format.
6305313687|5.0|\\"American History X\\" is probably the best film I can remember seeing in my collective memory of life.  It is the single most stunning, true-to-life, scary, and exciting film I have ever seen.  The cast was top-notch, everyone born to play his or her role.  This film is guaranteed to shock you with surprises 'round every corner.  The last scene left me up all night with excitement.  If you're looking for a drama that will frighten you terribly when you realize how true it really is, \\"American History X\\" is your best bet.
B00005JKJA|5.0|If you are a fan of the director David Lynch's work then you will know exactly what you are in for when renting this DVD.  Remember the surreal television drama Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me?  How about the movie Blue Velvet?  Both were the work of the master of cinematic dreams, aka David Lynch.  With Lynch, ambiance is everything.  He loves to take stories and rip them to shreds with obscurity and mockery.  Sweet and innocent &quot;Betty&quot; (Naomi Watts) moves to the big city of Los Angeles with dreams of stardom and in one particular scene blows you away with her dramatic talent.  Once there she is perchanced by fate when she comes upon an amnesiac &quot;Rita&quot; (Laura Harring) and thus ensues a thrilling mystery packed with Hollywoodish imagery and campy overtones permeated by a thick story line that will have you wondering whether it was the blatant Big City Critic reviews advertised on the box which made you rent the movie--or were you really a Lynch fan?  You should choose the 2nd reason because many will not understand the dream like state of most scenes without knowing where the director comes from--just know you will get confused.  The cowboy, the aging silver screen star, the hit-man who can't seem to do the job right--just more details in Lynch's idea of the blindingly (hint, hint) bright lights of Hollywood.  The crux of the movie surrounds the idealistic attitude we have concerning the mediatic white wash of suburbian innocence that in truth is a blatant lie (just a recording) and is in fact a twisted demoralized reality.  Perhaps it is white washed suburbia which gets twisted beyond recognition when Hollywood takes hold.  Or is it?  ;-)  The climax of the film occurs in a very sheik red velvet theatre in which Rita and Betty experience the truth.  A Spanish version of Roy Orbison's &quot;Crying&quot; is not to be missed.  Is everything as it seems?  Not with David Lynch at the helm.

B00006BTCA|5.0|I now finaly realize that this cd is every bit as good as the hype says it is.  It took me awhile though.  These songs sound boring at first but later on you'll find yourself humming them and trying to remember what song it is.  I really regret not placing them higher on my best of list for last year.  <br />The thing I like most about this album is how original it really is.  The only thing they have in common with Joy Division is Paul Banks sining style, the music is compleatly original.  And it really is very catch as well, try to not sing or hum along with 'Roland', it's damn near impossible.  <br />Every song is brilliant, right now my favorites are 'Say Hello to the Angels', 'The New', 'Roland', 'Obstacle 2', forgit it, they're all my favorites.  <br />Pitchforkmedia was correct to place them at the top of their 'best of 2002' list.  This record is defantly one of my top five for the last year.  Anyways, I've said enough.  It's a brilliant, original record.  You should buy it today.
0140042520|5.0|This book absolutely changed my life--had to get my car repaired one day, picked it up on a whim--read the whole thing in one sitting at a mechanics shop drinking coffee swill--they all thought I was crazy because and let out guffaws of disbelief every now and then and have to get up and walk out the door and pace, lost in thought---Everybody I've ever met who's read Keruoac read &quot;On The Road&quot; first--that IS NOT the book you read first by Kerouac--&quot;Dharma Bums&quot; IS--Why?  Dharma Bums style is much more straightforward and concise--whereas &quot;on the road&quot; is much more rambling in nature--you get bored with it sometimes--Dharma Bums travels along at a good clip and is Jack at his most life-celebratory--Kerouac is in this big mess of a life just like everybody else and he knows it--realizes that everybody &quot;steps to their own drummer&quot; and doesn't hold that against anyone--he was concerned with freedom and living life (at least in his early life)--he isn't trying to be a guru--he just tells it like he sees it--and, almost in spite of himself, what he sees is this slice of the beautifully rich infinity that surrounds us
B00005JKZT|5.0|Being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings book trilogy, I was very excited to see the Fellowship of the Ring in 2001.  I saw it on launch day, loved it, and saw it several more times.  So I, of course, decided to see this one on launch day too.  <br />I will say, I didn't like this one quite as much as the first, but it's also my least favorite book of the trilogy, so I wasn't too surprised.  There are quite a few more changes in this one than there were in the previous one, but I didn't mind too much.  I've read the trilogy four times, but I'm not so obsessed with it that I can't stand any change that occurs.  The soundtrack is wonderful, the cinematography, and just about everything else.  There were a few flaws and parts I didn't really enjoy, but overall, it was a wonderful experience.  Now I have very high hopes for what will hopefully be the emotional climax and conclusion of the trilogy coming this winter.  <br />And I do feel an 'overwhelming sadness' for those fans of the books who think they can't enjoy this film because parts have been changed.  Several of my friends are completely obsessed with the books, (one has read the trilogy a total of 23 times) and they were still very pleased with the movie.  <br />It's a great movie, that, as long as you don't mind some changes in the story, you should thoroughly enjoy.
0140185232|5.0|A book I could not put down--in this book Maugham is the  narrator of the tale of peoples lives--we follow a number of characters (most notably, Larry) and see the consequences of their decisions and priorities--the thing that I admire most about this book is the way Maugham somehow manages to present every character without ever passing judgement on any of their decisions--each character has perfectly understandable reasons for choosing the paths that they choose, and perfectly understandable consequences--and yet somehow Maugham teaches the reader a lesson about life, mainly through the vehicle of Larry--Larry is the only one in the whole book who never compromises himself, and ends up being the only one who is happy (as a taxi driver in New York, mind you)--and its not as if Maugham delibrately makes it happen that way--everything works out quite naturally and to the point--no surprises--A must read for young and old alike
B000066C1N|5.0|SPIRIT was an okay movie. What was most memorable about the film, however, was its soundtrack. This is just one kickin' soundtrack. I have listened to this cd over and over and over and some of the songs sill move me to tears (yes the music is that powerful). Some of my favorite songs on the album are:<br /><br />&#34;Here I Am&#34;<br />&#34;I Will Always Return&#34;<br />&#34;This Is Where I Belong&#34;<br />&#34;Sound the Bugle&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Sound the Bugle&#34; is an especially sad song and I have found that it is even more meaningful with our troops overseas fighting a war in the desert. This is a wonderful soundtrack and a great album for any children's music collector.
6305313687|3.0|The acting is effective so it must be the plot that somehow leaves you wondering if something a little less p.c. and more essential could have occurred. This film could have been done in the 50's or 60's. Time has passed and we have learned something from it though it feels like the truth of it was missed here. Didn't really grab me as I hoped it would.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Attention: For those who did not read George Orwell's classic dystopian novel \\"1984\\" in high school, college, or through personal initiative, please take the time to do so before diving into the soul shattering experience of the film version of this book, aptly titled \\"1984.\\" I imagine that many viewers could experience lapses of extreme boredom if they do not have a sufficient understanding of newspeak, thoughtcrime, and the political dynamics of Oceania/Eastasia/Eurasia before experiencing this soul shattering film. You might even want to read a few items about communism and fascism before watching the movie. In any event, the book and film are chilling in their presentation of a world in the grip of pure totalitarianism.<br />Originally released in 1984, \\"1984\\" tells the story of Winston Smith. Smith lives and works in what used to be the city of London, before an atomic war swept away the world as we know it and ushered in the dark gloom of Big Brother. Smith spends his days working away in a booth at the Ministry of Information, constantly updating and rewriting the party organs in order to make history fit with present realities. In the course of a day's work, Winston routinely changes rationing promises, removes people labeled as \\"non-persons\\" from articles, and burns records. During his off hours, he sits in his ratty apartment under the constant surveillance of the state, which keeps an eye on him through a giant monitor in his living room and with hovering helicopters outside his window. Occasionally, Winston gets to attend giant party rallies where he and other members of INGSOC watch televised propaganda tapes about the endless war with Eastasia (or is it Eurasia?). Each day is bleak, filled with consumer shortages, the endless nattering of propaganda in the background (\\"War is Peace, Ignorance is Strength, Freedom is Slavery\\"), and dreams about his life as a child or a place in the countryside.<br />Unfortunately for Winston, he just cannot make himself accept the prevailing view, namely that one need only give oneself up to the party and never question anything INGSOC pronounces as truth. His job reconstructing history makes him acutely aware that the party lies incessantly, and in Winston's world losing faith in the party means losing one's life after visiting Room 101 in the Ministry of Love. To make matters worse, Winston catches the eye of the lovely Julia and quickly becomes embroiled in seditious activities that Big Brother more than frowns upon. After Winston falls in with a high party official named O'Brien, the downward spiral begins in earnest, leading to an interrogation that is definitely an upsetting viewing experience.<br />This film is by necessity an intensely character driven vehicle. Thankfully, director Michael Radford obtained the services of John Hurt and Richard Burton to play Winston and O'Brien. Hurt shines as the tortured Winston, looking as though he's on death's door while he trudges through another bland day in Oceania. Burton is properly menacing as the enigmatic O'Brien, playing his role of party thug with equal parts compassion (oddly enough) and threat. I know less about Suzanna Hamilton, the actress who plays Julia, although she does an admirable job working between two great film stars. Incidentally, this was Burton's last film role.<br />I loved the atmosphere of this film. Radford creates a dank, dingy London I wouldn't even think about strolling through without a full body protection suit. The ubiquitous audio and visual propaganda is a nice touch as well, creating a sense of total immersion in Winston's world. As Winston slogs through the bombed out backdrop of London on his way to work, the viewer becomes aware of the party's total grip on the people through the canard of total war. The omnipresent image of Big Brother should certainly bring a smirk to anyone familiar with Russian history, since the guy looks a lot like Lenin.<br />I noticed that the Eurythmics soundtrack, while advertised on the case and in the credits, is missing from the film. This did not bother me much since I first saw the film years ago and do not remember much about the soundtrack other than the excellent score by Dominic Muldowney... I feel sorry for those who looked forward to having that part of the soundtrack included in their purchase. Despite this omission, the film is very much worth the money.<br />Great imagery, great acting, and a great message about the evils of 20th century fascism and communism make \\"1984\\" a must have for any film lover. I'll watch John Hurt in nearly anything, but he really turns in a powerful performance here. Pick up this movie and watch for the warning signs!hile advertised on the case and in the credits, is missing from the film.

B00005V3Z4|4.0|You have to love these reality/fantasy juxtapositions and this one works very well as time becomes the element which defines what you see while you eventually determine just what you did see. Jena Malone is an ideal love interest for this seemingly forsaken though somehow deeper than average character as he ambles through a series of experiences with a quietude that suggests something within him which is unusual at the very least. The roles are played well, the imagery is aesthetically stimulating and this too is a film for the ages.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Darkness, madness and hallucinatory images of Hell pervade this stunning, mind-blowing film set in the Vietnam War.  Herein Francis Ford Coppola has rendered a beautifully surreal work of art.  So much has been said of the original 1979 release, as well as this 49-minute more substantial REDUX, recently released on DVD.  It has been studied, discussed, and pondered over; it has been abhorred, feared, and embraced.  Undeniably, APOCALYPSE NOW has always packed a powerful punch, and nearly a quarter of a century of time has only served to intensify its transcendent force.<br />Based symbolically upon Josef Conrad's novel, HEART OF DARKNESS, this movie not only delves deep into the psyche of war, but also explores the vast facets of evil and indistinct limits of sanity.  Such are the themes that Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) must grapple with when assigned to dispatch \\"with extreme prejudice\\" a lunatic Green Beret, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) - a rogue officer bunkered in an absurdly gruesome renegade outpost on the far reaches of a river in Cambodia, the outer fringes of the war.  His trek down that river is an utterly absorbing, terrifyingly bizarre odyssey marked with all sorts of surreal, often nightmarish encounters.<br />Willard commences his mission with a small unit of men in a Navy patrol boat.  Along the way, they come across a number of variously strange, disconnectedly horrid and uproariously erratic entities - the most memorable of which is Robert Duvall's Lt. Kilgore, a surfing fanatical, riotously brash helicopter commander who takes Willard and his men on a riveting aerial assault in a hot area.  Choreographed under a blaring rendition of Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries,\\" this scene just takes your breath away.  It is Kilgore the cowboy who raps out the best quotes of this movie, which I need not even repeat, as they've all been repeated over and over here already - but the REDUX version gives him more ample air time, highlighted by his amusingly desperate attempts to get back his surfboard, which Willard and his men had stolen.  Duvall's performance earned him an Oscar nomination.<br />The REDUX version also includes an exquisitely ethereal encounter with the French at a rubber plantation in the midst of the jungle.  Willard and his remaining men have dinner with the Frenchmen, and the conversation essentially courses through the many sundry themes of the movie entire.  Afterwards, Willard sleeps and smokes opium with a young French war widow.  The aesthetic, dream-like qualities of these plantation scenes are such that it becomes somewhat unclear whether or not these French expatriates are actually just ghosts.<br />The film reaches its climax when Willard reaches Kurtz's cult-like camp-\\"the farthest outpost on the river.\\"  It is here that the American patrol boat floats right into some horrid apparition of Hell - dead bodies dangling from trees, decapitated heads swarming the landscape.  It is here that The Doors' ominous opening number, \\"The End,\\" gains its relevance.  The dead are omnipresent here, yet strangely far removed.  Indeed, this is the way the world ends.  The remaining living population is veritably brainwashed, worshipping their leader, Kurtz, like he's some kind of mystic divinity.  At this point, the film takes on an almost mythical quality.  Yet, though the tone is confoundedly serious here, there out of the blue comes Dennis Hopper's maniacal photojournalist, a steadfast Kurtz apostle, to lighten things up.<br />The performances in this amazing motion picture are simply tour de forces in every single aspect of the art of acting.  Martin Sheen exudes all the unfathomable depths of his intellectually contemplative, poignantly resolute hero through both the mediums of voice-over narrative and sublime corporeality.  He is nothing short of astounding. Then there's Brando, who, no matter who he is or what he's doing, cuts an unabashedly amazing figure on the screen. Whether you like him or not, itseems impossible to avert your attention from him whenever he's in view.  In APOCALAYPSE NOW he truly becomes the embodiment of all that there is in the whole vast world to dread, confound and disinherit.  He is the destination of the trip that everyone metaphorically takes, in some form or to some degree or other, down the winding river of life, cutting into the vast, pulsating heart of darkness.seems impossible to avert your attention from him whenever he's in view.

B000002OVJ|5.0|Ok, this one is one of three best live albums of all time, with Grateful Dead's &quot;Live/Dead&quot; and Allman Brothers &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;. It simply has to be.<BR>I am yet to hear the live album with musical perfection, intensity and consistance of that three mentioned here.<br />So I must say: <BR>I love all the classic rock music - Led Zeppelin STILL being my favourite, but I must say, THIS ONE TOPS and Zep's &quot;The song remain the same&quot; and Purple's &quot;Made In Japan&quot;, and Cream's live recordings, and other great live acts. (We will se what will be with Zep's &quot;How the west was won&quot;, I can' wait...). Believe me. I am mostly new to The Who; this is one of their first recordings that I got. <BR>I've heard before about The Who as explosive, intense, and very loud live act. But after hearing this, all that I expected - regarding my musical taste (read above mentioned again!) - was doubeled! I think that's good argument. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing! Right from the raw opener &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; fire began to jump out of my hi-fi speakers. So when explosive reading of &quot;Magic Bus&quot; (archetypal rock riffage!) ended, I turned back cd-player to the begining, and listened all over again. LOUD. Oh my God, what a out-of-this-world expirience it was. AND still is!<BR>From beginning to the end this album rocks hard. As one reviwer said, &quot;Heaven and hell&quot; is heavy as anything in '69 (but it haven't aged a day!); all the hit singles sound better here than original ones - for example, I didn't liked &quot;Happy Jack&quot; or &quot;I'm a boy&quot; very much at first, but here they are set on fire too. Beautiful. &quot;Tatoo&quot; is wonderrful track. &quot;Young man blues&quot; rocks HARD! What a power! All tracks, till the end, are played with such intensity and energy that I simply don't know how this guys could played this show on that high level all the way through. Einthwisle is one of the best bassplayers I ever heard. You can't believe what he is doing with his instrument - virtuoso, and loud one! Daltrey is a great vocal. Townshend delivers fire with most powerful riffs you can imagine - just check out &quot;My generation&quot; or &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;. Great and loud/efective solos, too! Some jams on &quot;My Generation&quot; kinda reminds me on Black Sabbath (but this was before them!). Keith Moon is definitely among 3 greatest rock drummers, (I would not enter in comparisons now) and could be the best. Loud, fast, busy, timed, and efective. That man rocks! From where all that inspiration?? They four are in perfect cohesion here...<br />Enough admiration, buy these and see for yourself!!<br />If this won't set you on fire, nothing will!!

0066214122|4.0|Prey, the latest offering from Michael Crichton, could almost be called \\"Crichton-Lite\\", but it still delivers with a fast-paced, action-packed tale of techno-terror.<br />In Prey, Crichton visits the field of nanotechnology, which means really little computers. In this case, the tiny computers are being developed for medical purposes, and of course for a couple good ol' fashioned military applications. The microscopic computers are programmed to function as a swarm, since one is too small to be effective at anything. <br />Of course, everything goes to heck when the swarm escapes and goes berserk. <br />The story is told in the words of Jack Forman, an unemployed but brilliant computer programmer. Being first-person, it's a departure from Crichton's usual narration, but feels much the same. It's less formal, but the end result is a pretty lively story that is never dragged down with too much scientific jargon. The strong moments of the story are quite gripping, making the book hard to put down. It's a quick read, good for a couple weekend afternoons, but sometimes that's nice.<br />Still, it's far from his best book. The ending was a little crazy, some parts were quite predictable, and some of his explanations left a lot to pure fantasy. I'd say that despite my initial impressions, by the time I finished this book, I felt it was probably his most far-fetched aside from Timeline. Needless to say, I'm not very fearful of the \\"Prey\\" scenario coming to pass anytime soon. But I do recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, engaging read.
B00005RIKI|5.0|This album is a rock perfection. All of the songs sound incredibly fresh, considering that it was released in late 1973. among all other rock giants with their complex studio polishing, and Lynyrd Skynyrd was totally anonimous band (from south).<BR>When I first heard this album (it was my first Skynyrd record), just after few listenings I made a state that this is best rock'n'roll album of all time. Ofcourse, you can't pick just one album as the all-time best, as there are a few dosens of them.<br />And this one is ofcourse one of them. It shows what's the rock'n'roll all about. It's not just southern rock (though influences are obvious) - it breaks throug the very essence of rock music. <br />The fact that this album, although their first, sounds so perfect, is because these guys heve been together for a long time before making this record, and was playing gigs around and rehearsing this songs. So they new exactly what sound are going to lay down. And it came out perfect, indeed.<br />This album is all: hard rock, southern rock, blues, bluegras even folk. It is pure and honest music with simple yet efective and beautiful lirics, like in &quot;Simlpe man&quot; (one of personal favourites). Also we get a big dose of humour in songs like &quot;Gimme three steps&quot; and &quot;Poison whiskey&quot;, delivefed with great riffs. No need to point &quot;Freebird&quot; as one of most requested rock song in rock history, along with Zep's &quot;Stairway to heaven&quot;, and deservely so. I could write a whole review just about &quot;Freebird&quot; and its trademark Skynyrd guitars. Ofcourse, I must mention &quot;Tuesday's gone&quot; as not great but PERFECT ballad rock song, almoust a prototype.<br />This Exspanded edition is worth the money if nothing, just for &quot;Mr.banker&quot;. Slide guitars and weeping lyrics&amp;vocals are pure pleasure. And it's paricular interesting to listen demo version of &quot;Freebird&quot; where you can hear Allen Collins breaking string at the beginning of solo, and the band carying on further without him and then with lead guitar again as he replaced the string, and bringing the song to fiery conclusion.<br />So, this is as classic rock as you can get; everyone should own it. <br />For those who aren't familiar with Skynyrd and like rock music (in genneral) this is great place to start your Skynyrd collection. Get this and be blown away... If you won't, you obviously don't know what's rock music about.
B00005JLKN|4.0|For the past several years we have been treated to the bizarre tales of Hannibal Lector.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (Part 2 of the Trilogy by Thomas Harris) surprised the public with a formidable tale well acted by Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster.  That film was excellent.  The second installment HANNIBAL (Part 3 of the Trilogy) was a sequel to SILENCE and while it veered a bit to the excesses of Hollywood it was still a good film with Julianne Moore stepping in very well for the Jody Foster role of Clarice.  Now RED DRAGON (Part 1 of the Trilogy) completes the appetite for the tale of horror of the life and misdeeds of Hannibal Lector.  In many ways this is the strongest of the three films, due in part to the fine performances by Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, as well as Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Some liberties were taken with the original story, but this incorporation of what we already have learned about Hannibal only adds to the spectrum.  A well cast, edge of the seat thriller, RED DRAGON is  a must if you've followed the other parts.
B000002JSR|4.0|I give it four because it is still Zeppelin. And material here isn't bad, it's good, very good considering that it is a leftover material. But compared to other Zeppelin albums, especially first six of them (which are all clean 5+ stars), this is around 3 and a half.<BR>In my opinion, only really weak track is \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\". Tried to dig that one many times, but I wasn't successful.<BR>Apart from that, other material is very interesting, highlights being \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" (great, punkish stuff with a lot of energy), \\"We're gonna groove\\" (it's groovin' indeed, great rytms and explosive guitars), blistering version of \\"I can't quit you babe\\" (featuring variation of 'Heartbreaker' guitar solo at one point, and loud Bonzo drum mini-solo) and \\"Darlene\\" (certainly not too strong on lyrics, but music makes that up, great boogie at the end!). All material from the \\"In throug the out door\\" sessions from this set are on-par with material on that album (I must say on that album is only Led Zeppelin tune that I can't stand, 'Fool in the rain' and it's nasty samba).<br />Bottom line is that this album is not for non-zeppelin fans, but for others is is a must-have. It won't be just filler in your collection, you'll be returning to it because of its good material.
B00005JK8K|3.0|I have the greatest respect for the Dene (Navaho) culture, and their important contribution to the U.S. winning the second world war. It is a story that very definitely needs to be told. If I were going to tell this story in the best format, it would have been a \\"Band of Brothers\\" type format with the real veterans being interviewed at the start of each episode. The movie should have a real gut feeling for the experience, like \\"Band of Brothers.\\" The same treatment of this story would have made for an exceptionally good movie. The closest this movie comes to this standard is the Native American actors.  Their camaraderie felt real, as off screen it probably is real.<BR>I also have to credit the excellent traditional Native American flute playing. Thanks must go to National Geographic for a excellent documentary of the same topic as a follow up to the release of this movie ( 5 stars in my book). The movie alienated me from the first extremely fake battle scene, and it was hard to recover. A Japanese soldier chops off the hand of an American, who has it placed and motionless conveniently on a log. This is followed by a cheap Prom date scream. An American hoses the area with a machine gun and Japanese soldiers eager to die jump into the line of fire. I never heard of this form of \\"Sepukoo\\" before. Maybe they were embarassed to be in such a bad action sequence? To be fair, the action sequences improve the farther into the story that you get.  However, at times, it feels like the script is being written specifically  to chain together the action scenes.  John Woo continues to do films with excessive violence.  A contrast would be the \\"designer action\\" sequences of Corey Yuen in \\"Kiss of the Dragon\\" or \\"The Transporter.\\"  Corey has my vote for best action director.  In terms of Nicholas Cage's long and interesting acting career, \\"Corelli's Mandolin\\" can be used as a contrast to when he is really putting his heart into his acting.  I could walk out of the theatre forgivingthe shortcomings of the movie due to the importance of the story. But then I am left feeling hungry for the same topic being treated correctly in the future.
B000002H6C|3.0|O.K. Metallifans, this is where things got a little lost. This is a good Metallica album, with excellent songwriting, intelligent lyrics, and a scathing indictment of the judicial system, war, and other generally miserable things to boot.<BR>There is one problem you'll have to deal with however... who is on bass? This was Jason Newstead's first full length studio album (he debuted on the Garage Days EP) but I'm not sure if James, Lars and Kirk let the producer know that he should be heard. He is absolutely missing in the mix. What we're left with for low-end is Lars on the double kickers that sound so washed that you almost feel like they are electronically produced; hmmm... are they? As a result we have James and Kirk ripping it up on One and other songs, but the listener is left feeling that this is Metallica with a condom on... really sterile. &quot;Safe Metal&quot;<BR>In conclusion, if you are a fan, buy it as you will find enough to like; man, ONE is really, really solid. If you are new to Metallica, try Puppets or Lightning if you want it to really rip, or the Black album where Bob Rock was at the controls and showed that in the world of producing the world's elite metal band, less really is more.
B000068TPN|4.0|This is a good movie and the point of making it was to do a Vietnam War movie \\"right\\" this time, meaning to show the camaraderie among the soldiers in battle without regard to rank. While I can say this is a good movie and recommend that others see it, it stops one scene too short for me. In the DVD version, you can find it in the Special Features.  Lt Colonel Moore is being de-breifed by Colonel Westmoreland.  We used to call him Colonel \\"waste-more-land.\\"  In this deleted scene, Colonel Moore was being congratulated on his victory as a blueprint for American involvement in the war.  \\"we are going to bomb these gooks back to their homes\\" is how it would have been accurately said with the racism of those times. Lt Colonel Moore's critical response was this WAS their home. This is in fact what was written into the book and not followed by the movie for fear of losing box office tickets.  I would be very happy for Hal Moore to somehow meet and talk to his former Vietnamese adversary. The fact is there would be more opportunity for this from the book, not the movie.  Similar occasions re-united former adversaries for World War II has resulted in the people with the most credibility speaking out to try to prevent future wars and needless loss of life.  Wars are very nasty business, people die and people get handicapped for the rest of their lives.  There is more than enough bravery on both sides here to honor in process of coming to a place of peace.  That is what I call \\"getting it right.\\"
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think that this is Xtina's best cd.  She has shown the versatility of her voice and her own vocal style.  She is an incredible singer and can sing.
B00005JLKN|1.0|My biggest complaint with this movie is that Ed Norton is a very pale version of Will Graham, the FBI uber-psychological profiler the character is supposed to be.  Norton is weak and whiny and should have never won the role simply because he does not live up to the Will Graham in 'The Red Dragon.'  Norton was beefed up more for 'Keeping the Faith' than he was for 'Dragon.' This in and of itself made the movie very lame for me. <br />Other than that this movie was pretty true to the book but I still give the original 'Manhunter' movie 5 stars and two thumbs up.
B00008QSAA|5.0|Released in 1969, Mountain's debut album &quot;Mountain Climbing!&quot; is considered by many to be their finest piece of work. The album immediately produced a mega hit with &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot;. Mountain, fronted by guitarist/vocalist Leslie West, bassist Felix Pappalardi, drummer Corky Laing and organist Steve Knight, had a sound not unlike Britain's ever so popular group Cream. Interestingly, bassist Felix Pappalardi produced Cream's albums &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;,&quot;Wheels Of Fire&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot;, so obviously his influence is evident in Mountain's sound. West's guitar licks do have a similarity to Cream's guitarist, Eric Clapton except that Clapton's playing was more extreme than West's. Mountain's songs ranged from power chord rocker's such as the above mentioned &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot;, &quot;Never In My Life&quot;, and &quot;Boys In The Band&quot; to beautiful slower melodic songs such as &quot;Theme From An Imaginary Western&quot;, &quot;For Yasguer's Farm&quot;, to acoustic based tunes like &quot;To My Friend&quot; and &quot;The Laird&quot;. This newly remastered version of &quot;Mountain Climbing!&quot; sounds better than the older version mainly because there seems to be more bottom end and mid-range added that the other lacked. There's also a bonus track &quot;Live&quot; version of &quot;Yasgur's Farm&quot; which is a nice addition as well as an eleven page booklet that includes comments by Leslie West and Corky Laing on the making of &quot;Mountain Climbing!&quot; as well as the info. about the group as a whole.  If you like listening to 60's or 70's groups/artists such as Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, The Who or Led Zeppelin then you'll love this excellent rock cd. Highly Recommended!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|....once again. Their 3rd album sounds like all their other stuff which is GREAT!!! No selling out here!! Same formula. This album rocks. I can't wait to see them in concert. The only thing I was a little disappointed about on this album was how short the songs were. On \\"Awake\\" there were some 6 to 8 minute long TOOLesque songs that I thought would be the new evolution of Godsmack in the future. Other than that small minus point, they're still #2 on my list under TOOL (that says a lot too). If you haven't bought this CD yet, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!? Then again, they might just kick down your front door and shove a CD in your face and make you play it.....
B00000AFHM|5.0|I first heard about Belle and Sebastian from a friend of mine who had also turned me on to Kings of Convenience. I went out and bought this CD as soon as I could. I didn't really get into it at first and I didn't really understand what some of the songs were about. But the album grew on me. The songs are timeless, they conjure up the ghosts of late 60s pioneers like Love and Nick Drake, while always sounding modern and in touch with today's alienated youth. But now that I have listened to these twelve songs thousands of times, the thing that draws me back the Boy with the Arab Strap is the MOOD. Autumnal, like leaves falling but with a hint of summer still lingering and winter waiting at the door. Like &quot;The Graduate&quot; or a Wes Anderson movie, graceful and beautiful, with equal measures of humor, sorrow and tenderness.<BR>If you haven't already, buy this CD and prepare yourself for the most subtle and gorgeous forty-five minutes of your life.
0553260111|5.0|In The Bourne Identity, by Robert Ludlum, a man is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of France with bullet wounds covering his body and a severe case of amnesia. He is nursed back to health by a local doctor. When the doctor performs surgery, a piece of microfilm is found embedded in the patients back. It is a bank account number in Zurich. The man heads to Zurich to find his identity, but assassins pursue him on the way. In his account is a passport, hundreds of dollars and a gun. He finds his name on the passport, \\"Jason Bourne.\\" Also, he finds his employer's name. A company based in New York called Treadstone 71. Treadstone is not listed in any business directories or phonebooks. He kidnaps Marie St.Jacques, a doctor staying for a meeting, to use as a shield. Jason saves her life, after nearly killing her numerous times, and they become friends. They travel to Paris together, where they find that the world's most dangerous assassin, Carlos, is hunting Jason. Jason knows he must kill Carlos from something in his blurred memories. Meanwhile, one of Carlos's men masquerades as Jason and sneaks into Treadstone 71, a covert operation inside the government. He kills several high-level government officials, one of whom was Jason's brother. The government believes Jason did it, and tries to capture him. As Jason and Marie question many of Carlos's operatives, Jason finds out that he is a highly skilled assassin, possibly more dangerous than Carlos. He is troubled by this fact, as he does not want to be a killer. Marie, however, refuses to believe him. As he gets closer and closer to killing Carlos, he finds that his assassin identity is nothing but a ruse to expose Carlos. Jason tries to get to New York to find Treadstone, which he believes will help figure out his identity. Carlos tries to get to Treadstone also, since Jason's reputation as a better assassin had lured away potential contracts. In a final confrontation, Jason reaches Treadstone at thesame time Carlos does. They fight, but Carlos manages to escape. The government captures Bourne and he tells them about his journeys since a doctor off the coast of France rescued him. They believe him. He and Marie live happily ever after... at least until the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, which I haven't read yet.<br /> This was one of the best books I have ever read. It is action packed and keeps you wanting more. It is a bit confusing though, with all of the places and names to remember. It is 535 pages and is VERY intense. I can't wait to read the sequel.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's 1984 release, \\"Ride the Lightning\\", was one of the best releases for Metallica every and is also my personal favorite.  The album is strong from start to finish, and although 'Escape' isn't exactly the greatest song, it's still better than others like 'Whiplash' and 'The Thing That Should not Be'.<br />1. Fight Fire with Fire: Excellent and very fast, and it also has a great riff in it, the chorus seems dumb at first,but it grwos on you.  The solo is slightly bland, though.<BR>Rating: A-<br />2. Ride the Lightning: Excellent song, great riffs all the way throughout the song, and a sweet sounding solo (especially after the first half of it), and a great chorus.  Just an all-out great song.<BR>Rating: A<br />3. For Whom the Bell Tolls: Quite odd, yet intriging beginning.  The song, though kinda slow, is good, Hetfield's voice really shines in this song.<BR>Rating: B+<br />4. Fade to Black: This is definitely a hit with every Metallica fan there is, and it has a good reason as well for it.  A good, emotional soft part, and a powerful riff towards the end along an epic solo from Kirk Hammett.  Also a great song to hear live.<BR>Rating: B+<br />5. Trapped Under Ice: Best solo on the album is 0:30 into the song, the solo intro is great, too.  An overall excellent with great solos and everything, one of the best songs on the track, and quite fast, too.<BR>Rating: A-<br />6. Escape: A slower song, but I still like it.  The chorus is definitely good, and the riff leading up into the first verse is great!  The ending is quite cool, too.<BR>Rating: B<br />7. Creeping Death: Might be the best song on the track, excellent riffs, excellent lyrics, excellent solo, an all-over complete song, not one near bad part in this song.<BR>Rating: A<br />8. The Call of Ktulu: I love the beginning, but the song doesnt match up to the others on the track, it just needs that \\"thing\\" to make it complete.<BR>Rating: B<br />This album is great, and strongly suggest it a ton!  One of the best metal albums I have heard (next to megadeth's Rust in Peace)
B000089RVX|4.0|A hardrock band witha lead singer that is good is hard to find. Amy Lee is good because you can actually understand her. They are nothing lie Kittie if that is what you think. She has no apperant pent up aggression. Evanescence is damn good.
B00005614N|5.0|Oh, my gosh. Some dude nicknamed Duke plays piano on 17 of his own compositions. Featured is a trumpeter and singer nicknamed Satchmo, who brought along five of his band members. They recorded on two consecutive days in NYC in April, l961. They were geezers, and the record buyers were paying more  attention to Miles and Coltrane and Brubeck at the time, although both old guys were still touring and pleasing audiences. Then Bob Thiele, a producer of all kinds of music, including Buddy Holly, but mainly a jazz expert, got Louis Armstrong and Mr. Ellington together at last. He couldn't get the whole Ellington Orchestra, so he compromised and got the Armstrong All-Stars as backup. The result is this total 67-minute masterpiece (and now a two-disc version as well, adding the rehearsal takes.) If you claim to love American music, buy one of these darn sets as quickly as you can. The sound is superb, the performances divine. If you don't love this, e-mail me and I'll buy your copy at a discount. But check for a heartbeat, because you may be dead and not realize it. This is the jazz pioneers' version of \\"Kind of Blue\\" in my opinion. The CD deserves much wider notice than it gets. Originally released on the small Roulette label, the album seems to have been overlooked even by Duke and Satchmo fans, which amazes me. If there are nearly 400 reviews of \\"Kind of Blue\\" posted on Amazon at this point, surely there should be 100 fans commenting on \\"The Great Summit.\\"
B0000542D2|4.0|&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is one of those movies that never seems as dated as one would expect, primarily because the artistic vision and the social documentary behind it are so unique.  The plot can only loosely be called a story:  the Beatles are trying to get ready for a televised appearance, but distractions and obstacles abound.  The running gag of Paul's grandfather is both humorous and absurd, tucked around the adventures of the Fab Four like a commercial break.  Although the music may not be as crisp as one might like, you can always listen to the recordings on CD. The real reason for viewing this film is for the revolutionary cinematography and concept.  (I had forgotten how avant-garde the field sequence was; it alone is worth watching this movie.)  Part documentary, part musical, part comedy - &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; succeeds on levels no one at the time thought possible.<br />Don't buy this for the special features; they are only mildly interesting.  Buy it for the film itself.
B000000Y1H|5.0|I've been buying Monk CD's for a year now, and have half-a-dozen. Of the 100 or more reviews of Monk music I've read here, the majority say &quot;There is no bad Monk album.&quot; So far, I have to agree. &quot;Brilliant&quot; is a 1956 effort with Sonny Rollins on sax and some other fine contributors. In 43 minutes, Thelonious challenges us, pleasures us, intrigues us. The moods and tempos vary among and within the five selections, four of them Monk compositions. In addition to Sonny's tenor sax, there is Ernie Henry on alto and Oscar Pettiford on bass, Max Roach on drums. On one number, Clark Terry's trumpet and the bass work of Paul Chambers are featured. But the star of this release is the pianist himself. One of Monk's endearing habits was his recycling of original tunes from year to year and label to label and ensemble to ensemble. Don't ever worry that the track listing on one Monk CD has some songs in common with another disc...no two versions will ever sound quite the same. On this disc, for instance, &quot;Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are&quot; lasts more than 13 minutes. Named for a Manhattan hotel, the song shows up again in late 1962 on the equally famous &quot;Monk's Dream&quot; album for Columbia, but at half the length and with only one saxophone. A similar fate occurs with &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; which is nearly eight minutes on &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; for Riverside, but eight years later was re-recorded for Columbia at half that length and with quite a different feel and sound (it is included on the &quot;Monk's Greatest Hits&quot; CD.) While he seldom recorded the song &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; after this album, due to its complexity and perhaps its perfection in this incarnation, the tune &quot;Pannonica&quot; also was redone in later years. Of the six Monk CD's I have, I can't tell you which is &quot;best&quot;. I haven't lived with them long enough and heard each of them enough times. I like them all. Oddly, probably the least interestingis &quot;Best of Thelonious&quot; on Blue Note. Those performances are from 1947-51 and feature the initial recordings of 16 of his originals in brief 78-RPM singles versions. Of the other CD's,  &quot;Monk's Dream&quot; and &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; are essentials, and &quot;Monk/Rollins&quot; and &quot;Monk/Coltrane&quot; are delights.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The bonus disk of the three remaining Fabs (before the death of Harrison) was worth the $. There is also plenty of footage cut out of the original versions...some Cavern footage, some from Hamburg, etc. that just makes this a true Beatle fans dream.<br />To see Paul, Ringo and George getting on like three brothers was just heartwarming. It proved that despite the negative garbage that went down during the breakup, and subsequent business disagreements, the Beatles still love each other like brothers. I'm sure that Lennon would agree.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Riding on the success of \\"White Blood Cells,\\" Jack and Meg White offer an album that realizes if ain't broke, don't mess with it. The album's title is \\"Elephant\\" after all; they're big, but they haven't forgotten where they come from. Jack still revels in the blues, Meg still gets by with tinker-toy drumming, and they're still doing the red-n-white thing. But it's these elements that let us know it's the White Stripes. Jack's sincere schoolboy lyrics and supremely fuzzed-out guitar on songs like \\"Black Math\\", \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" and \\"Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine\\" rattle down the road that lies somewhere between the Mississippi Delta and Detroit Rock City. Their cover of Burt Bacharach's \\"I Just Don't Know What to do With Myself\\" is also wicked-good. There are mellow moments too, such as \\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\" (sung by Meg), but there's no mistake that all-out, no-frills rock is the root of this band's success.<br />And while some tracks sound as if they could have been on previous Stripes albums, there are enough surprises to keep it interesting and display the band's growth. Most notably is the appearance of electric piano and a chorus of vocals of \\"There's No Home...\\" and the stomping faux-bass line (it's really a guitar) Jack conjures in \\"Seven Nation Army.\\" Overall, \\"Elephant\\" is a rock purist's dream album and is sure to be one of the best albums of the year. If nothing else, Jack and Meg are still the best brother/sister/ex-husband/ex-wife rock band in the business, even without a bass player.
B00008URYM|4.0|Madonna's back with another controversial video and I hope that unlike the past it does not eclipse the song or its message.  This track is a blending of electronica and hip-hop and imparts a message about Madonna's realization regarding American values and pursuits.  Who better to critique American life than one of the greatest living icon's of American pop culture.  After a 20 year career playing with image and amassing fame and wealth beyond most American's dreams, Madonna is offering her insight into where true happiness comes from - or more to the point - where it does not come from.  I highly recommend this single.  It also features the Day Another Day James Bond Theme Song - which was a big hit in 2002.
B000002UZ4|4.0|West end girls,Opportunties (let's make lots of money),It's a sin,what have i done to deserve this,always on my mind,heart and<BR>domino dancing are the best songs but the rest are pretty average. <BR>If you like the 80's stuff i would reccomend this cd as it showcases the great style and intelligent pop that they produced.
006092988X|4.0|Even the weak small tree in the back yard can grow with only little sunlight. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a poignant novel that beautifully displays the themes of a growing family, often compared to a growing tree. The journeys of the Nolan family, all extensions included, are captured in five \\"books\\", each documenting a period of their lives. Mostly, the focus is on Francie, the book beginning when she is age eleven in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, though there are also records of her early years and even her birth. When Francie is born and looks as if she might not live too long, her mother Katie is pitied for the sickly baby and she replies: \\"Who wants to die? Everything struggles to live. Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating. It gets no sun, and water only when it rains. It's growing out of sour earth. And it's strong because its hard struggle to live makes it strong\\" (93). Through this coming-of-age novel, Francie constantly exhibits her innermost thoughts concerning life, love, and her family from 1902 to 1919. <BR> After showing Brooklyn in the first book during the summer of 1912 as \\"serene\\", and quoting Francie's observations about the people who surround her, the path continues into lives of Francie's parents Katie and Johnny, beginning when they first met, and delving into their families. The tales of Katie's sisters Sissy, Evy, and Eliza and bits about Johnny's brothers Andy, Georgie, and Frankie are covered as well. Book Three begins when Francie is approximately age seven when the Nolan family moves to a new flat due to the accidents caused by an overwhelming amount of love from Sissy. Francie now begins a new adventure called school, which confronts her with both good and bad incidents. She painfully endures her beautiful father's death, and sees her mother's newest pregnancy, which is Johnny's child. She recognizes her mother's apparent love for Neeley over her, and learns that upon ending middle school she mustget her working papers. Francie yearns for education but realizes that she must work to help her family and keep them afloat. <BR> Book Four begins with Francie learning the ropes of factory life and to appreciate the necessity of work. Annie Laurie, Francie's new sister, is born. She will not grow up in poverty as Francie and Neeley did, because of the nice, rich man who is courting Katie. Francie finds her first crush, her first love, her first heartbreak all in this section of the book. In Book Five Francie leaves the necessity of her life of work and prepares for a life of luxury thanks to Katie's new husband. The novel ends with Francie bidding adieu to her old town, her old life, and her old self. <BR> Throughout my journey of reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I both laughed and cried, and realized that there were aspects of this book that I liked and ones that I disliked. I liked knowing about all the people in the family, and knowing their emotions rather than merely knowing about Francie alone. I liked growing up with Francie, and observing her ups and downs. Though all of this possibly could not have been written in a shorter length, I felt that the book was too long and that it dragged at certain points. While I enjoyed the writing style of Betty Smith, I think that some of the vignettes were unnecessary.  I most liked the constant symbolism of the tree growing in the backyard. \\"The tree hadn't died. A new tree had grown from the stump and its trunk had grown along the ground until it reached a place where there were no wash lines above it. Then it had started to grow towards the sky again...It lived! And nothing could destroy it\\" (483).
B00008AWOD|5.0|OK well first off, I have been a bit of a Placebo fanboy ever since \\"Without You I'm Nothing,\\" but \\"Black Market Music\\" OWNED me for 2 years solid, I still think those are 2 of the best CDs ever.<br />Being a Placebo fan in the U.S. is a lonely thing.  The music is so good, but not many people know that.  I have spent so much time introducing the band to my friends, family, internet buddies, and random strangers on the street.  But just about everyone who's listened to them have gotten hooked.  It was my mission to spread the word to the masses.<br />So here we are now, \\"Sleeping With Ghosts.\\"  The anticipation I had waiting for this release!  I spent a solid month at the Placebo web site, listening to \\"The Bitter End\\" and watching the video.  When \\"SWG\\" finally arrived, I was ecstatic.  The CD artwork is exceptional (and is currently the desktop on my computer).  The time had come to listen to the CD.<br />The opening track, \\"Bulletproof Cupid.\\" a take no prisoners instrumental really starts things off the right way: a driving, hard hitting 2+ minutes that asserts this band is not just a vehicle for singer Brian Molko's vocals.  These boys can play their instruments.  Second song, \\"English Summer Rain,\\" is screaming SINGLE as loud as it can, with a dance beat and serious sex appeal.  Third song, \\"This Picture,\\" feels like it should have been on \\"Without You...\\" an upbeat guitar driven singable chorus that again says SINGLE all over it.  Fourth song, the title track, takes things down a notch, a softly quiet \\"soul mate dry your eyes\\" ballad.  Fifth song, the lead off single \\"The Bitter End,\\" just grows and grows and grows on me.  I can't get enough of this song.<br />Other greats on this CD and my personal favorites are \\"Plasticine\\" and \\"Second Site,\\" which borrows a line from the Violent Femmes (\\"third verse same as the first\\").<br />Buy Sleeping With Ghosts. ...
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is an unbeleivable disc. Audioslave delivers everything you would want from a rock n roll band. These guys are a great fit together! Chris Cornell's earth shaking voice resembles the mighty Brian Johnson of AC/DC, and the former RATM boys are tighter than ever! The disc is full of head banging Sabbath influenced riffs that also have a Hendrix feel. Even the mellow ones have class and are true rock songs. This is not a GRUNDGE album-thank god! The lyrics are amazing and makes Zack De La Peace Corps' anti-american political whining sound even more annoying. This band was meant to be and i can't wait to catch them live!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I feel this is one of Tom Hanks &amp; Shelley Longs' funniest roles. I loved this movie because it hits home with me &amp; maybe with anyone that has purchased a older home. I still makes me smile no matter how many times I've viewed it. Great bit of fun!
B000059XUO|5.0|What can I say. I love this movie. It's one of my favourites of all time, and I can definitely understand why it has become a cult classic.<br />Yes, it is dark and violent and takes place in the worst part of town, but it deals with themes like love and friendship and still manages to be touching in some parts. I can't quite explain why I love it so much--it might be in part because it takes me back to the days when I was in highschool and grunge was cool, but it also has a great soundtrack and Brandon Lee did an awesome job with the role. Actually, all of the actors were perfect in their roles, especially some of the less savory characters.<br />The entire movie was filmed at an outdoor set at night, much of it in the rain. The dark, gloomy atmosphere of the crumbling and decayed inner city is very well conveyed. If like me you have a streak of melancholy in your personality you'll probably enjoy the dark atmosphere of the film.<br />As one other reviewer pointed out, some of the lines in the film are hopelessly cheesy--but that's okay. Sometimes cheese is good. (After all the movie was adapted from a comic book so what do you expect.) If you're looking for realism, you won't find it here. If you're looking for an awesome trip you won't soon forget, buy this DVD!
B00005UWBP|5.0|Jurassic Park has got to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The directing, animatronics, acting, graphics, and casting were perfect in this movie. The beginning was perfect, no sitting around waiting for action. It opens with a worker being attacked by a velociraptor and Muldoon(Bob Peck) trying to help him.<br />You meat a character named Nedry(Wayne Knight) who is working for a company that will pay him 1.5 million dollars if he steals the dinosaur embryos.<br />Then some other stuff happens, yaddah yaddah, anyway, Grant(Sam Neill), Ellie(Laura Dern), Gennaro(Martin Ferraro), Malcolm(Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond(Richard Attenborough), reach the island. The island is owned by Hammond the billionaire. It is a theme park with real dinosaurs. The main four go on a tour with Hammond's grandkids.<br />Needless to say, the tour goes bad. Nedry steals the embryos, pulls the power and runs off. The five remaining characters are stranded out by the tyrannosaur paddock. Ellie has already gone back to the visitor's center where she, Hammond, Muldoon, and Mr. Arnold(Samuel L. Jackson) try to figure out what Nedry has done.<br />The tyrannosaurus escapes, eats Gennaro and nearly kills everyone else. Moments later Ellie and Muldoon come to try and find everybody, but they have left. They find Malcolm lying in a pile of hay, and the two cars destroyed.<br />Now Grant, and the two grandchildren, Lex and Tim, must find their way back to the visitor's center while Ellie, Malcolm, Muldoon, Hammond, and Mr. Arnold try to get the power back.
B00005JL2O|4.0|Goldmemeber, the third Austin Powers flick, is not the best of the three, but the second best. I like &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; better. But, if you are like me and prefer to have the whole collection, I would buy it. There are some funny moments, it's just not a laugh out loud for the whole film Austin Powers. In summary, it's not horrible, but it's not my favorite Austin Powers flick. Hope that helps you some!
0440234743|4.0|This is my first John Grisham Novel.  It was very complex in plot almost as if i was watching a movie.  Grisham has written a great book about a man who overcomes great obstacles, people whos sole motivation is greed and a person who isn't affected by it. This book is super.  It keeps you guessing until the very last page.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Excellent, a lot better than White Blood Cells, which was a great album in its own right.  Songs such as &quot;There's No Home For You Here,&quot; &quot;I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart,&quot; &quot;The Hardest Button to Button,&quot; and &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine&quot; just prove how unique and special the White Stripes are...I highly recommend Elephant.
6301967992|4.0|&quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; is producer/director/screenwriter/actor Roman Polanski's comedic rendition of Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; legend.  The bumbling Professor and his timid assistant Alfred (played by Roman Polanski) travel to Transylvania to study vampires.  The Professor and Alfred rest at an inn festooned with garlic.  That evening, the innkeeper's daughter (played by the *stunningly beautiful* Sharon Tate) is kidnapped by the Count (played with a characterization combining elements of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing).  The distraught innkeeper (played with a Zero Mostel characterization) runs out into the night to rescue his kidnapped daughter and never returns alive.  The Professor and Alfred seek the Count's castle.  The Count invites the Professor and Alfred to stay at his castle and to study in his library.  The Professor and Alfred agree, they learn that the Count and his flock are planning a formal dress ball, and the real fun begins ...<br />This film's scenic vistas and its theatrical sets are impressive -- they are complex, ornate, and convey a somber atmosphere.  And Sharon Tate's beauty is impressive -- previously an unknown actress, this film gave general public recognition to Sharon Tate.  Roman Polanski was involved in *all* aspects of this film's production, and his quality touch is visible throughout the film.<br />It is ironic that this film's plot revolves around Sharon Tate's kidnapping by the Count and his flock.  After this film was released, Sharon Tate and her real life friends were murdered in their home by members of the Charles Manson family.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I can't really explain why I like this movie so much, but perhaps it's Jean Reno as an ... Italian assassin.  Plus the extra footage that was taken out for the American release is actually meaningful (not an extra 10 mins of them walking in a park or something).<br />Also the relationship between Natalie Portman's character and Jean Reno's is very interesting.  It could be seen simply as a guy protecting a helpless young girl and child's infatuation for a cool older guy, but it has this eerie-ness to it that you just can't shake.  I really like that.<br />If you've never seen the movie before, you should definitely check this movie out.  If you've seen the American version and liked it, definitely get this one -- the extra footage is well worth it.
B00008CLOA|3.0|At last, after all the hype, the long-awaited 5.1 audio version of DSOTM is with us and, now that I've heard it in SACD, I must say that it's a bit of an anti-climax. Sure, the disc is a great demonstration of the surround concept and the sound quality is superb, but I feel the music itself is now dated and boring.  A much better example of 70's music standing the test of time, and also available in surround sound, is Fleetwood Mac's `Rumours' but, in my humble opinion, the most enjoyable and best example of a 5.1 mix that I've heard to date has to be the DTS version of Sting's `Brand New Day', released in 1999 and played on a Pioneer DVD player. The music, lyrics, production and sound quality on this disc are simply outstanding.  Whether a DVD-A or SACD version of it would sound better to human ears is a matter of conjecture. I believe that both DVD-A and SACD have `missed the boat' by appallingly bad marketing decisions, mainly by not replacing new CD releases with hybrid CD/ 5.1 discs from the outset and by making them more affordable. Despite the audiophile `anoraks', to the vast majority of human ears the difference in sound quality between SACD &amp; DVD-A is imperceptible.  Why the music industry couldn't think of the poor music buyers and exploit only one of these systems from the beginning is beyond me.  I believe that it's probably too late now to for either of these formats to succeed, so why bother promoting them further, especially as the much higher storage capacity Blu-ray Disc technology is soon to be in production.  As for Mark from Philadelphia, he sounds as if he works for Sony or has he somehow heard an `inferior' DVD-A version of DSOTM?  Doesn't he know anyway that most DSD discs go through either a PCM or analogue stage in the recording process.  As a footnote, I possess a `Quadrafile' vinyl record which tests `Money' on all of the four (failed) quadraphonic formats. I play this through an old quadraphonic receiver on a good, but not state-of-the-art, turntable. I can honestly say that, although the channel separation is not as good, the overall sound is better on vinyl than with the SACD version of `Money' played on a Sony SACD player, through a modern amplifier.  For goodness sake, lets stick with stereo CD for now and have ALL the music industry develop blue laser technology for multi-channel audio, and dump both the failing SACD &amp; DVD-A formats!
B00008DDXC|2.0|When the dvd of this movie ended, I looked over at my house guests and we all made the same gesture.  You know, where you hold your hand out and kind of move it like a teeter-totter. In other words, &quot;so-so&quot;.  <br />So where did it go wrong?  Well, I never was blown away by the book series.  It's dang good, don't get me wrong.  I have nothing but high respect for my fellow woman's libber, J.K. Rowling.  She is one of my heroes, even if she is a single mother.  But I know I'll never be as rich as her, no matter how many fantastic books I've written.  And those who know me, know I'm responsible for quite a few.  <br />The kids in this movie do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life.  But they're all too old for the parts, which is not their fault, rather the fault of some bonehead Hollyweird producer.  The special effects are first rate, too, and a feast for the eyes.  But I guess there just seems to be too much polish on this, whereas something like The Dark Crystal or Neverending Story Trilogy has a bit of you-know-what (HINT: it's yellow!) and vinegar.<br />But hey, it's entertainment!  But I think they should stop the series, it's getting old.
B00006RIO7|3.0|Even though the movie was a big hit and won several Oscar awards, I didn't find the soundtrack as good as the movie. The music is nice but actually it's boring to hear. I feel that has a good production and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the rest of the cast (that includes Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger and Queen Latifah).<BR> I didn't find it intresting.<BR>I only like two songs from this album which are: \\"Cell block tango\\" sang by Queen Latifah, Lil'kim and Macy Gray and the other song that I like is \\"Love is a crime\\" performed by Anastacia.<BR>The whole music has the sound of the 20's and 30's.<BR>The biggest song of the soundtrack is the #1 dance hit \\"love is a crime\\" performed by Anastacia.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Somehow I missed DD in the theaters. Maybe it was the way the film was promoted. Maybe I was out of the country.<br />This film has some incredible acting and superb writing. I am transfixed by the performances, particularly J. Gyllenhaal's. As one of the actors says on the commentary, it would have been an entirely different film with a different lead.<br />The inclusion of cut scenes on this DVD is a WONDERFUL asset that gives a lot of insight into what was going on, along with the director's commentary. J. Gyllenhaal also speaks on that commentary but is a little irritating at times, interrupting the director when I want to hear what he has to say.<br />This is essentially a scifi movie with insightful protrayal of our society. Highly recommended.
B000002E5J|5.0|I love this album, I think I've heard it like 1,000 times or more. I bought it back in 1996 when Shakira wasn't know and I felt the album very acustic and simple but full of love, with lots of interest and feeling.<BR>Now after 7 years I have Shakira's whole discography and any of her other albums haven't reach the quality of this one. Ok I know that now she sales millions of cd's and all that but this one is her best and anybody who knows her from back then will share the same opinion.<BR>This album features her first hits like: &quot;Estoy aqui&quot;, &quot;Antologia&quot;, &quot;Un poco de amor&quot;, &quot;Quiero&quot;, &quot;Pies descalzos&quot;, &quot;Donde estas corazon&quot; and &quot;Se quiere se mata&quot;. Each one of the singles became a hit.<BR>If someone doesn't know her from back then won't feel the change on her as a person. She used to be a lovely person but know she's serious and her feet are not any longer on the ground.<BR>I highly recommend this album it's beautiful. It's her best without doubt.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack have exploded with this, their third album. An unreal collection of fantastic riffs and extremely technical vocals make Faceless Godsmack's best album yet. Rarely does an album come along that you can listen to all the way through without skipping any songz. This is one of those cds. Sully Erna is one of the best voices in metal today, and this release marks a rebirth of sorts for Godsmack. With Faceless, they have managed to make a BETTER album then their selftitled album, and better than \\"Awake\\". I VERY rarely buy cds, but in this case i made an exception. BUY THIS NOW!!! You won't regret it.

B00005YW4H|3.0|It's true:  you'll find a majority of one-star and five-star reviews here.  Why?  Norah Jones' album is one of the first albums of its kind released in several years... it's deeply personal, subtly produced, recorded and conceived somewhat spontaneously, and it contains throwbacks to Depression-era music.  It's the vocal and musical styles represented here that are so *different* from most other music today.<br />Do remember that this album was released on Blue Note records, a small exclusively-jazz label.  Remember that Norah Jones was playing coffeehouses with friends, performing other people's songs.  This album was not intended to be the massive success that it has become; therefore, approaching the album as though it should be a remarkably fresh and innovative statement in the progression of popular music is erroneous.  As of now, it's true that Norah Jones has yet to incite any astonishing breakthroughs in pop music.  This is also true:  the fact that this was never the intention comes through in the laid-back performances.  This is true:  that the Grammy-winning &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; was recorded live in the studio.  This is true:  Norah Jones, whether she intended it or not, has called into question the perceived necessity of high production, of distorted guitars and dance beats, of electricity-dependent instrumentation, of the massive amalgamation of pop, jazz, country, and rap into one increasingly indistinguishable genre.  That's why this album is the Best of 2002.  Not because it's the greatest performance ever (ha, when was the last time that great performance insured someone a nod for a Grammy?), but because it has made people think differently, AND because it's a genuine, unintended smash hit.  When was the last time a Blue Note record went from underground to radio-friendly to radio-requested to multi-platinum?<br />While we can wait for Norah Jones to put out the album that pushes her piano- and vocal abilities and makes her a virtuoso (which, by the way, has ALSO never been insurance for a Grammy nomination), we needn't hold our breaths.  We don't need fiery performances or vocal acrobatics, we merely need remember that for the first time in a while, our calculated pop sensibilities were shaken by something that came from the heart.  If anything, this album IS all about remembrance, with it's treatments of Hank Williams and Roy Acuff tunes, small group live recording, and unwavering simplicity.  The music is really &quot;One Flight Down&quot; from our demands, and we begin to see our ancient face and hear the tunes and create the space that we've needed for so long.by the way, has ALSO never been insurance for a Grammy nomination), we needn't hold our breaths.

B00000F1D3|5.0|This is a great CD. I think the first 6 songs are the best. Believe fits in with any songs of today but still fits Cher's style. The power is another great song. I saw Cher's farewell concert on t.v. last night and she performed many songs from this album. I think it is sad she is retiring. She has had many great songs and a great voice.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I've always loved the vocals and hard hitting riffs of Godsmack, but this album proves to be their best effort so far. Only one complaint about it(with most nu-metal bands) is the song structures are so predictable(into, main riff, chorus, main riff, chorus, solo, exagerrated chorus). But none the less the cd is still killer. I also noticed more thought out and better solos on this album<br />1. Straight Out Of Line - 10/10 - Typical Godsmack song, hard hitting and all around great vocals plus solo.<br />2. Faceless - 7/10 - Suppose to be one of the best on here but I think it could be better, still very nice but not the best<br />3. Changes - 9/10 - Killer riff topped off with great chorus and solo<br />4. Make Me Believe - 8/10 - Just seem to really enjoy this song. Not much to say about it<br />5. I Stand Alone - 10+/10 - Came out a little awhile ago as a single, but this is what Godsmack is all about. This is possibly the best song they ever did.<br />6. Re-Align - 10/10 - Another out standing song with all the elements of a killer song<br />7. I F****** Hate You - 7/10 - Nice riff but doesnt really stand out.<br />8. Releasing The Demons - 8/10 - Not much to say except a great song, hard hitting as usual<br />9. Dead & Broken - 7/10 - Chorus is kinda weak, but I really like the riff in this song. <br />10.I Am - 9/10 - The Chorus riff to this song is exceptional<br />11. The Awakening - 6/10 - just tribal drumming, doesnt really do much for me.<br />12. Serenity - 6/10 - Slowest song on here and probably the weakest. Just one long melodic and repetitive song.
B00005JLSE|5.0|No doubt about it. Chicago delivers the Old Razzle Dazzle. A bit of Funny Honney's, but without a doubt it delivers All that Jazz. Murder Jazz and a spectacular cast, theirs only one movie that delivers it all. As Blly Flynn (Richard Geere) would say <BR>\\"That's Chicago\\". You couldn't have chosen a beter cast. I can't think of anyone how would be a better Roxie then Renee Zellwiger. I can't think of anyone else who could do it alone other as Velma other then Cathran Zeta-Joness. And who could deliver the Razzle Dazzle then the one and only Richard Geere. And when your god to Mama Queen Latifa's good to you. And who else could be Mr. Cellophane then John C. Reily. And lets not forget Rob Marshell without him this film may not even exist, and surrprisingly his first film. It is not a surprise that this is an Oscar Winner. It has everything you could possibly want in a musical. It starts off with Roxie Heart, a woman who cheated on her husband, and shot the man she cheated with. She was sent to  jail where she met Velma kelly who killed her husband and her sister. From their Billy Flynn is hired to get Velma and Roxie free from jail. And aong the way it is this terrific scramble to see who will be more famous then the other but in the end, Velma and Roxie got together to the stage. A fantastic movie for almost the whole family. A terrific movie. The one movie that delivers Roxie, Razzle Dazzle and All that Jazz, that's Chicago
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is almost as good as Hybrid Theory. All the songs are good except TRACK 9. TRACK 9 doesn't have ay hard rock or frequency like most of their songs. My favorite songs are:<br />TRACK 3: Somewhere I Belong. The first single for this album.<BR>TRACK 5: Hit The Floor. The beats and lyrics are rap, since Mike Shinoda sings most of the song. The chorus is rock.<BR>TRACK 13: Numb. Starts off slow and sad, then it goes to heavy metal again when the chorus starts.<br />This album is definitely gonna be a platinum album, just like Hybrid Theory. I see Linkin Park getting more and more popular as they keep making albums.
B0000584V3|5.0|I have listened to a few death metal bands in my day, and none quite compare to Opeth.  Blackwater Park was the album that got me into death metal, because it is a perfect example of all that is great in death metal.  The singer is amazing, when he growls, it is like a wall of sound, but his normal voice has a pure tone.  The band plays very well, the sound is very solid, and very musical.  Any death metal collection is missing a serious hole without Blackwater Park.
B000069CWE|5.0|If you like rock music a lot and like Hybrid Theory, then you will DEFINITELY like Reanimation. Reanimation is basically a remixed album from Hybrid Theory, only that it has more songs. Also, the beats are rap instead of rock. A lot of rappers are featured in this album. There are a couple of rock songs in Reanimation, like X-Ecutioner Style. The new songs are:<BR>(Chali), X-Ecutioner Style, High Voltage, (Riff Raff), Intermission, My December, and STEF. The remixes to the songs from Hybrid Theory (Crawling, In The End, Paperkut, Place 4 My Head, etc.) are also in rap beats. If you like rap, you'll definitely like Reanimation.
B000002H6C|5.0|The riffs and rhythms on this album are unbelievable.  To think that they created this album after the death of their gifted bassist Cliff Burton, is amazing in itself, not too mention this is probably their most complex effort to date (vocally still hoping they decide to stop tarnishing their own good names and put out something they know will not get played on TV or the radio).  <BR>After listening to what is considered \\"metal\\" now, then playing Metallica ...and Justice, it almost makes you wish you could relive the eighties...well, almost.<BR>Even though this album is based around perfect crunch and double base, I believe this album is also Hammett best work.  His extra long, and rightfully so, solo on Blackened is proof he is one of the most creative guitarists to pick up an axe.  And what he does to the works One, And Justice, and to Live is to Die is memorable.  <BR>By this album whether you listen to metal or not.  This is not considered a classic for no reason.
B00008O0WN|1.0|Without the guidance of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek has just become a commercial series... the quality of the scripts and the characters involvement is beyond the Neutral Zone - and this is not good at all!<br />...
B000089RVX|4.0|The lead singers voice is incredible.  Her trained vocals and the music make for a different, but great rock sound.  Most of the songs have the same kind of rhythm and melody, however, which makes the album have a repetitive quality.
B00008NRLX|5.0|They say that most artists have one great record in them and that they tread water from then on in, trying to recapture that elusive 'something'. I remember hearing Hollywood Town Hall, buried under my first job, playing in bad bar bands and thinking things mattered more than they did. I also remember listening to the opening riffs of waiting for the sun, the fuzz pedal illuminating a staccato drawl and being hit by how pure the harmony was and how easy they made it sound. The Jayhawks were my big secret - living in the UK they hardly got mass media attention - and they were where I went to escape. Songs that made you feel something. <BR>The first bars of Stumbling through the Dark, the simple chord progression, the layers of instrumentation building up until the drums kick in then the voices holding it all together, harmony and counter harmony. And the one thing that rings out is the simplicity of it all. A great production, open and clear allows the instruments to come through separate but together. <BR>All the reviews I've read rely on other bands as markers. It sounds like the Burrito's, it sounds like the Eagles, and it's the Byrds, CSNY revisited. It's all of these but more importantly it's the Jayhawks. That's not to say references can't be made. Marc Perlman's bass lines could have come straight from John Wesley Harding era Dylan. The guitar on SarahJane out Keefs Keith Richards. One Man's problem has a Stones swagger to it. Don't let the world get in your way draws heavily on Bowie but takes Major Tom to a bar and gets him drunk on good whiskey and makes him empty his heart.  <BR>But when people have to use comparisons drawn from the past, it's because they don't sing songs like these anymore. And these are songs - not samples or compressed theft from others with more talent. They'll get into your head and into your heart and you'll carry them with you gladly. These are songs of hotel rooms, early mournings, last and lost chances, faces and names gone but not forgotten. And the beauty of them is that they aren't so specific to mean one thing to one person only. They'll end up being reference points on your rainy days. Hollywood Town Hall will always be my sentimental favourite Jayhawks album. Trouble my favourite song. But Rainy Day Music has memory in it that you'll make your own. This isn't the sound of a band treading water. They're walking on it. Superb.
6305508550|5.0|If you have ever worked in an office environment, you have to see this movie. <br />I've watched this movie over 100 times and I still can't stop laughing.<br />I still use quotes from this movie on a daily basis.
B00008QSAA|4.0|The original CD release of Mountain's first &quot;Climbing&quot; is considered my many to be their best. This remaster corrects the horrid EQ problems on the original and includes a live bonus track. The liner notes are wonderful with pictures and comments from both Leslie and Corky. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it's only 36:56 mins long.
B00003CX9E|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't already been said, Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made in entire history of cinema.<br />As for the DVD, the movie looks great, the commentaries are excellent, the extras are great....then there's disc 2.<br />For the novice Orson Welles fan, like I was when I bought this DVD I liked the Battle Over Citizen Kane.  But having immersed myself in his career, I would now say that the doc is good-vg at best.  It gets at the bare bones of Welles, Hearst, and Citizen Kane.  But I guess the major problem I have with this doc is that it was made on the foundation of the old-but-incorrect belief that this movie finished Welles.  He was more than Kane, both before and after, and there are other docs that could have been used instead.  <br />Overall, the DVD set was great.  The only thing missing was the War of the Worlds broadcast which early reports said would be included.  But that's not a big loss.
0195073401|5.0|This is an extremely well written and comprehensive book.<br />Some (including my fellow reviewer Mr. Mackenzie) have criticised it on the basis that its methodology suggests that an argument expressed in mathematical terms is inherently more valuable than the same argument expressed in verbal terms.<br />However, this criticism is invalid, tendentious and is a &quot;straw man&quot; critique (ie. where one makes up a weak proposition, in order to easily demolish it); I know of no-one who would suggest that an argument expressed in mathematical terms is inherently more valuable than the same argument expressed in verbal terms.<br />The point which one may more clearly appreciate after reading Mas-Colell et al is that some arguments require less space or time or are more comprehensible if made verbally, while others require less space or time or are more comprehensible if made mathematically. (This does not make one form of an argument more valuable, but simply easier to comprehend or demonstrate or both).  Thus, economists should continually be thinking about these issues, in order to find the best vehicles for their arguments.<br />A good example of this can be found in Mas-Colell et al's discussion of the two Welfare theorems. One should remember that it took approximately 180 years since Adam Smith (&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;,1776) first stated a version of the First Welfare Theorem (loosely paraphrasing - that individual selfishness can lead to collective good), for this to be proved axiomatically. Without the systematic thinking, and use of assumptions, displayed in MasColell et al this would still today not have occurred and Smith's conclusion would still be a mere conjecture.<br />[To put it rather more crudely, a proof of the First Welfare Theorem using purely verbal arguments eluded mankind for 180 years, but was found within 10 years using a combination of verbal and mathematical arguments].<br />All interested in thinking, not just about the budgetdeficit or price of electricity, but about how people make decisions about all facets of their life, should buy this book.  One of its strengths is that it spend time discussing why and how each of the results derived here is important (eg. Arrow's demonstration of the impossibility of consistent voting preferences under certain conditions, which revolutionised how political scientists thought about voting) rather than merely demonstrating the results. By the time one comes to the end of it, one will have a good understanding of both what we do know,  and do not yet know, about human behaviour.

0671042858|3.0|The young heroine of this story, a young girl lost in a very dank woods, is certainly admirable and strong and courageous, and we root for her.<br />But the obstacles thrown in her path, while certainly dangerous, feel far too mundane to really get our blood racing. And King's fawning use of the Red Sox as a form of salvation and connection for the girl really doesn't work.  Maybe if you're a fanatical Sox fan, but even then, I think the device is thin, at best.<br />Once again, as King does from time to time, he takes a perfectly acceptable short-story (or maybe novella) and pads it to book length.  He did this with CUJO, but that book had such momentum and drama behind it that we actually enjoyed the unnecessary detail, but it kept us in that world a while longer.  But as with GERALD'S GAME or FROM A BUICK 8, TOM GORDON simply feels padded.  And this makes it seem a bit tired and uninspired.  It's rare to read a King book that feels rote and uninspired, and therefore I feel particularly harsh towards it.  He's certainly got enough money without needing to release work that clearly didn't fully fire his imagination.  Less is more, on several levels.<br />The only positive to this book, I would say, is that if you have younger kids (like 12-15) and you want to introduce them to King without full immersion in his better, but bloodier and rawer, books, then TOM GORDON might be an okay way to start.  But I'd go with EYE OF THE DRAGON, which he wrote with a younger audience in mind.  THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, sadly, is one of the very few Stephen King books I can't recommend.
B00000JPH4|5.0|I saw this movie when it was current in the theaters, having been a fan of Henson and company since the mid-sixties. Back then, they frequently made guest appearances on the Jack Paar Show, Ed Sullivan and then made the rounds to every OTHER talk and variety show you could name at the time. I knew that ANYTHING he and his organization would produce would be impressive, cerebral and unlike anything else in their field. I was right. This movie is pure magic!<br />Henson and Frank Oz use a combination of finger and hand puppetry; their own creation, the \\"muppet\\", a combo of marionette and puppet, and body suits to create the characters of this film, a soupcon of elves; potato-like creatures that are as cute as bugs' ears; vulturous beings called Skeksis, long-nosed sloth-like characters called Mystics and Ogra, a cantankerous sorceress that helps the hero, Jen, return a crystal shard to the titular power source deep in the heart of Skeksis territory.<br />Along his way to do this, he meets Kira, an adorable girl elf of his people, the Gelflings, that helps him survive a lot of the perils on his journey. One of the more horrific parts of this film is a scene where she and a few of the potato-like people, called Podlings, are tortured and drained of their life essence by the Skeksis so that the vulture-like monsters can stay invigorated.<br />It seems the Gelflings were nearly wiped out by the Skeksis when an ancient prophecy revealed that a lone gelfling would seize power from them somehow. Both Jen and Kira were saved and raised, by the Mystics, in Jen's case, and the Podlings in Kira's. It isn't mentioned where Ogra comes from, but they must have been a DAMNED interesting race! Jen is that gelfling, but it is Kira that finally makes it possible, after all her hardship.<br />The scene where Kira introduces Jen to her Podling friends is almost worth the price of the tape/DVD.<br />Why must Jen return the shard? That's explained by the ending and I'm not going to spoil it for you here. Suffice it to say that though Jen is the supposed star of the movie, Kira steals the spotlight from him often, as does Ogra.<br />The whole production will take you right back to the highest quality family special of the fifties, only this is done much better than any of them! The art direction is as good as \\"Legend\\", if not better. The puppetry is artistry at its best, setting new standards and bewitching both adult and childish eyes as does the set design, which words cannot describe in some cases. This movie is the perfect holiday family movie....the kind you used to go see or see on TV at Easter or Christmas back when Eisenhower was president. It's a forgotten masterpiece of family entertainment with depth, soul and entertaining staging. Get it and you will NOT be sorry!it for you here.

B000055Y0X|4.0|The Dr. Strangelove DVD is very good as most of Kubrick's DVDs are bare bones.  This one has two new documentaries that are informative, though at times a little rushed.  It would also have been nice if the longer one was broken into chapters for easier access.  <br />The movie looks great.  I guess my only complaint is that it would have been nice to see some deleted scenes or alternate takes as extras, but since Kubrick was notorious for not giving access to material he didn't approve of, I wasn't holding my breath.  Though I will say that this is one movie that definately would have benifited with a feature-length commentary.
B000007PSR|5.0|Opel is a collection of left over tracks from Syd's solo career. The tracks range in quality from the much refined Opel and Wouldnt you miss Me to being able to hear them talking in the studio and syd playing his guitar pretty sloppy like in Word Song and Let's Split, which are really good anyhow. My advice is to buy The Madcap Laughs and Barrett or his Floyd work first before this album since this is the scraps of his music, but even the scraps are good. Let's Split and Milky Way couldve easily fit in with the madcap album and Lanky, which is really like a toned down version of Stoned Alone, is probally the closest Stoned ALone will ever be to being on an Album, and of course the title track Opel excellent, in ready condition to be put on a album, with no backround noise like in some of th other tracks which makes you wonder why it was never put on 1 of the orginal solo works
B00008OLIC|4.0|just the production level alone of Dr Feelgood is good enough to buy it. the guitars are really in your face and the band sounds absolutely over the top - well, Motley is always over the top, but i digress... the Crue definitely expanded their sound for this album. T.N.T - Terror 'n Tinseltown is pretty interesting, just with all the LA sounds and stuff<br />then theres the acoustics on 'Slice Of Your Pie' - which for some reason reminds me a little of Aerosmith - that whole sleazy vibe... and of course,'Dr Feelgood' is a Crue classic - and it makes me feel alright:)<br />'Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)' has always been a Crue fav or mine. but i've only had it of the Greatest hits albums.<br />The solo in 'Sticky Sweet' always blows me away. Mick Mars can still wail with the best of em.... Vince's vocals sound like a damn banshee screech! its awesome! Tommy Lee and Nicki Sixx are the tightest they've ever been
B000001ESP|5.0|By almost everyone's account, this is Rush's finest moment.  It was also their biggest commercial success, and spawned many AOR singles that are still frequently heard on the radio today, more than 20 years later.<br />One might be tempted to look at the album in a more jaded fashion now.  Surely it can't be as great as all that?  But giving it an honest listen, I can say it still reigns supreme amongst many fantastic Rush albums.  <br />EVERY song is a winner. The sheer variety of styles in the album is amazing, and each song is a triumph.<br />TOM SAWYER:  Easily one of their greatest triumphs.  Neil Peart's drumming is out of this world, and even the keyboard solo in the middle jams.  The song is propulsive.<br />RED BARCHETTA:  A wonderful futuristic vision of a world in which driving a car is a crime.  Manages to evoke an entire society in a few lyrics.  And musically, the song has one of Rush's great solo sections, where the driving guitar perfectly evokes the feeling of driving at great speed through wide-open country.<br />YYZ:  Their most amazing instrumental.  Showcases their talents in all four instruments.  WOW!<br />LIMELIGHT:  Beautifully written song about the artificiality of being a celebrity.  Among Peart's best lyrics.  And over the years, Rush has never emerged as a bunch of celebrity brats, despite their decades long success, so one is inclined to believe that they mean what they say.  They enjoy making music (and do it well) but their real joy in life does not come from being famous.  This is one of their songs that I can see getting radio play 50 years from now.<br />CAMERA EYE:  Rush's final foray into long-form music.  This 10+ minute song takes its time building and building.  It's a snapshot of the mood of being immersed in a big city (New York and London, specifically).  Again, Peart's lyrics are right on the money and very evocative.  After this, Rush never wrote an epic length song again.  Hearing the CAMERA EYE again, I realize that Ido sometimes miss them...they could do things with mood and drama that a shorter song can't quite pull off.<br />WITCH HUNT:  A haunting song with a GREAT guitar riff.  And Peart's drums really put  punctuation marks on the drama.<br />VITAL SIGNS:  The most keyboard dominated song on the album, it kinda of hinted at what wa to come on Rush's next few albums.  Musically, it's very solid, but lyrically the most obscure song on the album.  Still holds up well, though, even though it feels a little like a \\"period piece.\\"<br />If you can only own one Rush album, this is the one.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B00007E8V4|1.0|I saw these guys during Ozzfest 1998, back when they were trying to get big.  I couldn't deal with the singer's histrionic screaming then, and I still can't deal with it now.<br />It's bad enough that the lyrics make no sense that Serj has to go on political tirades in virtually every single song.  I'm not bashing on the Democratic party by any means, but this is not the way to draw people to the left wing of politics.<br />Why?  Because I can't take them seriously enough when they insist on singing about a pizza (\\"Chick 'n' Stu\\") or screaming about the politics of war with phrases like \\"death showers\\" (\\"Boom!\\").  That's why all of their albums, this one in particular, are unlistenable in my opinion.<br />The masters of politics in music are still U2, people who can draw fans of all walks of life without having to rant and rave and pontificate pointlessly about liberalism.  System of a Down just doesn't do it for me.
B00005JLRT|1.0|As a long time Trek fan, I can safely say that Nemesis is the worst Star Trek ever (and that's saying something, considering the Shatner-directed train wreck, Star Trek V).  It's not just because the script relies on cliched sci-fi plot elements without contributing anything fresh.  It's not just that the script is dull, illogical, and poorly paced.  It's not just that every actor seems bored with her or his amateurish dialogue.  It's not just the lame close-ups of hands and faces, the poor lighting, terrible score, the cheap sets and corny special effects.  And it's not just that they needlessly kill the best character unceremoniously.  It's that this isn't Star Trek.  The science is bad (Trek used to pride itself on its accuracy), it is untrue to character types, it doesn't follow the established Trek rules for technology (holograms can be generated anywhere at random, it seems), and, perhaps worst of all, it has the main characters break the Prime Directive, the number one rule of Star Trek, without thinking twice, all for the sake of an unexciting, traditional shoot-'em-up chase sequence with no purpose in the overarching plot.  Thankfully, this should be the last TNG movie, ending a great TV series and a very poor movie franchise (save First Contact).
B0000039QA|5.0|Notorious B.I.G. guarenteed one of the best emcees of all time. He is honestly amazing. I myslef do not usually listen to much mainstream hip-hop at all but Biggie I can not get enough of. It is a tragedy that he had to go so young over such nonsense. And for anyone who think 2pac is better just remember the whole beef between them was started by 2pac which 2pac admitted that he started just top sell more albums. I am from the west coast and i am not feelin 2pac in the least but Biggie is at the top of my list. Listen to all his albums they are amzing.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|to buy this CD. Johnny at his best. (despite his age).<BR>Laugh and Cry. Hurt will rip you up. Powerful music.
B000056NX5|4.0|I just watched this version for the first time, back to back with the 1973 movie version.  I found the singing very solid.  Glenn Carter, Jerome Pradon, and the others were all good, Renee Castle especially.  The Simon Zealotes character was exciting, I don't even remember if there was a similar one in the 1973 version.  Pilate here was superb, a lot better than the 1973 movie, so with Caipphas and Annas.  They may have been a bit much, but hey, this is theatre.  I wasn't impressed with Herod.  What I couldn't quite take though, was that Jesus was played with too much humanity, as if he lost his Godhood.  Glenn Carter pouted too much, he cried too much.  I thought that Ted Neeley had more fire in his eyes. Glenn's Gethemane was alright, but I've heard Michael Ball in a concert do better.  Jerome Pradon was interesting but he wasn't Carl Anderson.  I liked the film being staged in an indoor set with a lot of interesting possibilities.  The set was not limited at all.  The interviews showed many points of view, how the actors/singers approached their parts, how the technical bits were put together.
0395925037|4.0|This book was great! I think people should really take the time to read and appreciate a book like this. Althouh this book was a mind scrambler and was written by a horrable human being, it really gives you the insight look in Adolf Hitlers' mind. Some parts were exaggerated if you ask me but i think everyone does. It's so amazing to read this book because you can sometimes agree with some of the points he made. I really think this book helps you find out a lot of our history. So i really think you should read it.
B00008I8IF|5.0|I went with a friend to nastyville, tn. last year to see Gary Louris perform his first solo acoustic show ever. He performed most of the songs from Rainy Day Music and I being a song writer was struck by how good and catchy these new songs were! sure there are influences abound, the Byrds, Gram Parsons, Crosby Stills and Nash. but this cd is pure Jayhawks! they just get better every new cd they release. I think they are finally at ease with who they are! this may very well be their finest hour.
B000002UAR|2.0|Both early and late in their career, the Beatles created some awesome music (A Hard Day's Night, Abbey Road).  But in the middle years (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour, Sgt. Pepper) perhaps nothing captures their slump like Revolver.<br />The excitement generated by the opening ringing chord of A Hard Day's Hight gives way to the orchestral background of Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere. <br />Taxman is awesome. A couple of other songs are good.  The rest is boring filler and the experimentation of Tomorrow Never Knows. Taxman is so good I'm giving it 2 stars.  Thanks, George.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica like Em or not this album is just a great and if your a metallica fan it's better so if your thinking of buying it it is very much worth the money.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|OK I have read reviews from other magazines and It makes me a little uneasy to see low reviews for this new edition to the godsmack phenomenon. Yea I am little biased,but my god with all the sappy pop, and whiney(my life in the hood)RAP,I just find it refreshing to hear some actual instruments being played on 10, accompanied by sully's patented screams and grunts.Godsmack opens on a heavy note with &quot;straight out of line&quot; and continues to kick your teeth in for the next five songs,of course they throw in the much played &quot;I stand alone&quot;, but even after hearing  it 100 times it just keeps getting better.Yea of course there  are a couple of fillers towards the end, and ending on a soft note with serenity.But for the most part it's a great album.
B00008H2LB|1.0|When I first heard about this album, I had high expectations.  Everyone was telling me how great Linkin Park is and how they are so &quot;hard rock&quot;.  But those are all just lies.  They are not even close to being hard rock and I should know since I am the ultimate expert on rock music.  Real hard rock bands and songs are The Calling's &quot;I'll Go Wherever You Will Go&quot;, Lifehouse's &quot;Hanging by a Moment&quot;, No Doubt's &quot;I'm Just a Girl&quot;, and Sugar Ray's &quot;I Just Want to Fly&quot;.  Now if you want real rock music, you go out and buy those albums.  You'll be doing yourself a favor and I should know since I am the ultimate expert on rock music.
B00007AJF8|2.0|It was good for the first 30 minutes, but the rest was just stupid. I've never seen a movie take a nose dive like that. I mean once that girl says she wants to have a sex change it is down hill. While too many movies suffer the fate of creative bankruptcy, Being John Malkovich is a refreshing study in contrast, so bracingly original that you'll want to send director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman a thank-you note for restoring your faith in the enchantment of film. Even if it ultimately serves little purpose beyond the thrill of comedic invention, this demented romance is gloriously entertaining, spilling over with ideas that tickle the brain and even touch the heart. This had an interesting concept that could of worked, but it looks like there were to different writers. One wanted to right a comedy, and the other wanted to write an episode for tales from the crypt, then both ideas were smashed together and were totally ruined. This is the only John Cusack film I didn't like. Anyway, puppeteer's working as a file clerk on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan office building; this idea alone might serve as the comedic basis for an entire film, but Jonze and Kaufman are just getting started. They then totally turn the whole thing around into some and stupid film full of mindless sex scenes and then it finally ceases to be funny and just becomes stupid, so I recommend seeing something else like Say Anything or Better Off Dead, those are actually funny through out the duration of the film!
0393316041|5.0|As far as Nobel Prize winners go, Mr. Feynman surely must be the most interesting of the lot.  This autobiography is a remarkable journey from Feynman's youth through to his golden years.  He mostly covers his professional life but does touch upon personal incidents (disease and death of his first wife).<br />Throughout his storied life, Mr. Feynman had worked on the Manhattan Project, lectured students on physics at premier universities, traveled and taught in Brazil and Japan, played the bongos and drums, frequented strip clubs, won a Nobel Prize, chased women, deciphered Mayan hieroglyphics and solved a space shuttle disaster mystery to name just a few adventures.<br />The books consists of individual stories that cover major sections of his life (college years, Manhattan Project years, etc.)  Throughout these stories, Feynman presents himself as a fellow who effortlessly found himself in odd and amazing situations.  For instance, while playing a tambourine-like instrument in Rio de Janeiro, Feynman ended up in the Carnival festivities partying through the streets.  With other such incidents, Feynman is one who has lived a full life.  I would have loved to have met such a unique individual.  As such, this book is a wonderful starting point.
B000005B0U|5.0|Don't let the fact that the movie is not all that great deflect you from buying the soundtrack.  <br />This is probably the best collection of blues to come out in years(at least when it is related to a movie)  <br />It has <br />Blues Travler<BR>\\"Born in Chicago <BR>The Peter Gun Theam song(a classic) <BR>The gospel classic  \\"John the Revalator\\"  <BR>My own personal favorite \\"How Blue can you Get\\"<BR>And the all-time classic \\"Louisiana\\"<br />My impression-The movie may not be up to snuff, but don't let that be said of the soundtrack.
B00005JLZL|3.0|My review title is a joke I once heard, but it is a much less convoluted oxymoron than this movie! I give it three stars for its suspense through most of the plot, which makes it never boring, and for some compelling acting. But through twists that repeatedly undermine the story you thought you were buying into, the film ultimately becomes self-destructive. I've seen it said in various reviews that this movie promotes an anti- death penalty agenda. Well, it sure does seem to much of the way through. But in the end I found myself seriously asking if this film might really be a joke that those reviewers never caught on to. I can really see supporters of capital punishment getting the last laugh here, having a field day in the end, however much they might have been put out with what they perceived along the way as propoganda. After mulling over this movie for a while, I grew to feel a little pride in my never having been a strong zealot one way or another on the capital punishment issue. For the film certainly shows how zealots for a cause can become fanatics who contradict the very principles that attracted them to the cause in the first place. And that amply happens to death penalty opponents in this case. If death penalty advocates want to make a case that opponents are not morally grounded and will sell out their very principles in an effort to promote them, the opponents of the death penalty in this movie have played right into the hands of such criticism. The supposed heroes of this movie think they've won a definitive victory that can't be turned against them. But instead they have done the ultimate in turning of their own cause on its head, and give the other side more ammunition than ever. I'll get no more specific, to avoid spoilers. There is suspense enough here to keep your interest. Just don't expect it to make coherent sense in the end.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|godsmack ROX.  their CD ROX.  I waited for the countdown @ midnite for their new album 2b released... & it was SO worth it!  the best track is of course \\"I stand alone,\\" but the other songs kick too.  now that they got a new drummer aboard, the sound is definitely more defined than b4.  this is their best album yet.  if u don't know godsmack, u gotta get this album cause Sully's (lead) voice is out the window.  <br />long live GODSMACK!
B00005B3Z6|4.0|My initial introduction to Queer as Folk was through the American version produced by Showtime, which I fell completely in love with. The writing, the acting, the sets, the sex: all of it added to the allure of this realistic and unapologetic show. I subsequently learned that it was a remake of a show first produced in Great Britain, so I looked into getting a copy of it. <br />In the British version of QAF, I found a much more gritty, dark, sardonic, and realistic look at gay life. This version is not so caught up in American political correctness or spoon-fed messages. Don't get me wrong; I love the American version... in fact, it's probably my favorite as a total package. But the British version's attitudes about life and death - epitomized clearly by the death of their friend - is more truthful and less subjected to pop culture. If you like the American version, get this and watch it. You won't be disappointed.
B0000024SI|4.0|Just a few years ago, I had a limited appreciation for Bob Dylan.  His songs seemed to meander endlessly and his vocals and harmonica playing were tolerable at best.<br />Flash forward to the present.  I curiously borrowed this CD and in spite of six of the nine songs exceeding five minutes in length, I find a certain appreciation in Bob Dylan's songs.  They songs are quite captivating especially the lyrics.  I love the blend between the instruments with the exception of an occasional whining shrill harmonica.  Even Dylan's voice sounds good in spots and always intriguing.  Ballad of a Thin Man and Highway 61 Revisted are my two faves on this collection.  Love the haunting piano and Dylan's delivery on the former and the smooth laid back attitude of the second one.  Thoise opening lyrics are ultra cool.<br />Anyway, the other seven tracks are pretty cool.  I'm even getting used to Like A Rolling Stone which always seemed a bit too long.  This is indeed a high quality Dylan recording and big time fans should snatch this one up quick.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is one cool album. I love nearly all the songs except fer session. its not bad but the others outmatch that one. Its worth a fortune . The songs are not \\"fixed formula\\" like someone else said. If anyone looks back, Sting mixed all kinds of instruments an he created his own style....butthen on he stuck to it. U can experiment till u strike the right chords.From then on its SUSSSSSSTENANACE. LP dosen copy the same rhythm and vibe frm their previous album. They have the same look but a diff feel fer all the songs. All LP fans must have it. Its l;ike u wudnt be a LP fan without HT and this one. Its easier to criticise than to make an album like this. Everyone better HIT THE FLOOR when METEORA hits ur player..............5 4 3 2 1!!!!!!!!

B00008H2LB|5.0|This is the best cd in the world. Linkin Park's Meteora, is the best. They have gotten better and newer ideas and they will grow larger in the music buisness. They have all the right songs in this CD. They are all new,exciting, and FRESH. They are the best band and have the best ideas. END OF STORY. They are TRULEY the BEST I THE WORLD!!!
B000021YQV|4.0|Toxicity is just a great album, and SOAD is a great band. There are great moments on the album, and there are some parts that ***, but overall its a really good album. Song-by-song breakdown:<BR>Prison SOng: Intro is stupid, nice verses and bridge thogh. 6/10<BR>Needles: One of my faves. Great intro, bridge, lyrics. 9/10<BR>Deer Dance: Great song, has probly the best lyrics. 8/10<BR>Jet Pilot: I kinda hate this song. I dont really understand the lyrics. 5/10<BR>X: Yeah the guitar riffs are good, kinda short song tho. 6/10<BR>Chop Suey: What do you think? 10/10<BR>Bounce: This song is just weird. bridge is nice. 7/10<BR>Forest: Another great song, intro is great, sweet bridge. 8/10<BR>ATWA: This songs kinda slow for me but nice lyrics. 7/10<BR>Science: Intro and bridge are great. 7/10<BR>Shimmy: Woah. quick song, but i dont really like it. 6/10<BR>Toxicity: The alternating time changes are great, lyircs and riffs are top notch. 9/10<BR>Psycho: The lyrics are kinda repetitive, but one of my favorit moments on this album is the guitar solo that closes this song. 7/10<BR>Aerials: Its a good song. starts quiet, gets loud, and ends quiet. I think it would be better to end the album with psycho, but thats just me. 8/10
6304233639|5.0|I am not going to tolerate any more bad reviews of this movie.  Just stop it.  What's wrong with a fun movie?  Did this movie do anything less than it said it would?  Space men invade, we fight them, we lose for a while, but then we take them down in the truest, pluckiest American (ok, Earthly) fashion.  And Will Smith was so great to watch on film.  That swagger as he lights that cigar.  That cocksureness as he drags the alien bad guy through the desert.  Yeah, aliens, you've been roaming the galaxy knocking off planet after planet, but you ain't never seen anything like us.  We may be down, but we ain't out.  Whammo!  Now gimme a cigar.  This movie is not about reality.  This movie is pure escape, and well done.  This movie is about the MYTH that is us, and that's why it works.  We love to see our greatest qualities blown up large on film, and one thing we are as Americans (ok, earthlings) is that we don't give up, not even to alien invaders who have better weapons. Will and Jeff were great in this, but the best scene was the suicide/kamikazi drunkard pilot who takes out the mother ship after telling his rag-tag, mixed race children that he loves them.  That one pulls at your heart strings and SHOWS you what it means to be a hero and a human and a recalcitrant mutt (American) at the same time.  I love this movie, simplistic as it is.  It is only as simplistic as our view of our own hero self.  And in that way it is very real.
B000053VAF|5.0|Ah, Mooby...<br />Kevin Smith is one of the hottest young filmmakers today. And it is no wonder, he makes great films--Clerks (what he did on such a small budget and his work as an indie film), Chasing Amy (not your typical Kevin Smith movie, but a great film, Dogma (the best of what he has done), and even Mallrats was good, though it did poorly at the box office and Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back (his spoof of himself). But Dogman is his crowning achievement.<br />Dogma is easily in the top 100 movies ever made. Smith's dialogue is on par. It's a great satire as well as a philosophical/theological statement (the thinking man's movie). And done his way--the independant way. Smith does a great job directing, and his script is well-written (though he is flexible enough to make changes while shooting). And Smith and his producer Scott Mosier do their own editing--a real bonus as it helps keep the director's vision alive.<br />Smith also pulls out some great performances in this film. Linda Fiorentino plays the main role of Bethany Sloane. She does a good job, but her performance is below the rest of the cast. She is just a little too low-key. Matt Damon gives a brilliant performance, and even Ben Affleck (and actor I have little respect for) gives a solid performance, though he tends to be upstaged by Damon. Alan Rickman gives a respectable performance. Chris Rock and Salma Hayek are wonderful. Jason Lee is great, as he always is (easily the best performance of the film). Of course you have Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as our favorite duo - Jay and Silent Bob. Great job guys. And there are good performances by George Carlin, Alanis Morissette (a particularly hard role since there is no dialogue), Janean Grafalo (oh how I wish she had been casted as Bethany, the role was made for her), Better Aberlin (as the Nun--you know which one), Dwight Ewell, Ethan Suplee (as the Golgothan), and of course Walt Flanagan. There are a few glitches and a few casting questions, but overall Smith pulls great work out of his actors. <br />As a dvd, Smith puts together a #1 package for his fans. First of all it comes in a nice slipcover case instead of that cheap packaging so man dvds come in. His menus are interactive, cartoonish, and very entertaining. There's this odd 'grandma' lady running around the dvd. She's great. There are two commentaries. The first is your typical Kevin Smith commentary: the cast and crew sitting around, eating, and cracking jokes, occasionally talking about the movie. and of course, you have Affleck hamming it up trying to get the spotlight on him with absolutely nothing to say. The second commentary is a technical commentary, with only Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier (producer, and it was his idea to do this track), and Vincent Pererra (View Askew 'official' historian). This commentary focuses on 'the how' of how the film was made. A value for any independant filmmaker, especially since Smith doesn't fall back on money and CGI. It's a shame he didn't include a commentary track like this on his previous films (but maybe there were enough complaints and that is why we have it here). And on disc 2 - There are over and hour and half of deleted scenes, storyboards (for the mooby sequence, triplet attack sequence, and no man attack sequence), outtakes, the trailer, and advertisement for Kevin Smith's comic books store Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, and one of the most interestingly done filmographies/biographies I've ever seen on a dvd. This is how dvds should be done. All you other filmmakers and distributors, take a good, long look at this dvd, and learn from Kevin Smith. This is what we pay for, this is what we want (in addition to a good movie).<br />And I end with this: picture it--the Buddy Christ.
0385504209|5.0|For anyone who has that secret fascination (and who doesn't) with the Illuminati, Templars, Masons, et al this book is a must.  It will cater to your secret passion in a buffet format and keep you wanting more.<br />I must also say that I loved the character of Sophie Neveau.  It is so hard to find a well-written feminist character.  The traditional view is that they are always second fiddle to the square-jawed male.<br />Not here!  Sophie is intelligent, sexy, strong and brave -- even in parts where our male here is nervous, stymied, embattled.<br />It's wonderful that in a book that focuses on the sacred feminine their relationship reall shows a (every?) man's battle with femininity and the strange instinct to love/hate, fear/need, virgin/whore it.<br />And all that without being preachy - hey our guy can't drive an standard, but she can, and he willingly lets her!  It's the way most writers misportray any minority - they have to make a big deal about it.  Brown makes Sophie a HUGE deal by not making a deal about it!<br />After I wrote that I had to up it from 4 stars to 5, it takes some craft to pull off the above.<br />The other great thing was the RESEARCH.  Brown put a lot of work into this and it shows.  For anyone who writes and speaks with hidden meaning (or veiled allusion to the genetic roots of words) and amuses themselves (and occasionally others) to death with their parenthetical semieosis-laden way of thinking, this book is an absolute joy.  These people, of which i consider myself one, will love Brown's 3rd person omniscient university professor interlocutor style.<br />The plot seems fairly linear, like a 'follow this string to the goal at the end' chase through a big house,  you always know that you're working to find the next scavenger hunt clue.  I found this to be (sorry) a bit monotonous of a trick.<br />Although 3/4ths through the book brown played an absolute coup d'eteat -- as i thought I'd solved one riddle just a few paragraps later he said 'No that's not it.'  I had to laugh out loud that he had played me for a dupe!  I loved it, I knew he knew how he was pulling us along.<br />This book was a quick read, but not fluffy.  i enjoyed it very much and am going to read some of his other works.<br />Keep up the work Mr. Brown!  Us  stacks-rats love seeing our kind light up the mental silver screen.said 'No that's not it.'  I had to laugh out loud that he had played me for a dupe!

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's Meteora is one of the best CDs I have ever purchased.  It hasn't left my CD player since I bought it.  If you are a LP fan, definitely pick this one up...if not, still get it.  You won't be disappointed.  LP is a rare band in that they don't use bad language to express their POV's.  LP's music is the type that you won't have to worry about listening to when the kids are around...there's no singing about killing anyone or anything like that.  I highly recommend this CD.

B0000669JL|5.0|The Bob Marley collection \\"Legend\\" does indeed make its case for Marley as a regge legend.  More than any other artist, he helped bring regge music to mainstream audiences with his excellent songwriting and musicianship.  He could be political without sounding preachy, and also wrote some of the sweetest love songs of any musical genre.  Marley was popularized in America, of course, when Eric Clapton remade his \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\"  Clapton's version is outstanding, but Marley's is equally so and is the one were the song's subtle political message is more overt.<br />Other outstanding tracks on the collection include the sweet \\"Three Little Birds,\\" the ace peace and love song \\"One Love/People Get Ready,\\" the straight up love songs \\"Is This Love\\" and \\"Stir It Up,\\" the political rant of \\"Buffalo Soldier,\\" the call to arms \\"Get Up Stand Up\\" and the rave-up \\"Jamming.\\"  Even among the lesser well known songs there is not a clunker or misstep in the mix.<br />Overall, a superior single disc anthology that establishes Bob Marley as one of the most important musicians of his era.
B00003CXIY|3.0|Good humor, not OVERLY HILARIOUS but funny. Sorry, but Tom Green is as usual over rated. The skinny guy DJ Qualls steals the shows best parts with his dancing and &quot;finaly got some&quot; scenes.
006441034X|5.0|Sophie lives in a small village in the magical land of Ingary.  Her village fears the heartless wizard, Howl, whose dark castle insists on circling the village--but it is a wicked witch who suddenly places an aging spell on Sophie, causing her to leave the village and, exhausted, take refuge in Howl's castle.<br />  Filled with finely drawn characters, this is a book accessible for all ages.  Perhaps the best part is when the characters visit our world, and we see things through their perspective.<br />  Jones includes bits and pieces of standard fantasy, from fire demons to seven-league boots, but what results is, as always, entirely her own.<br />  Highly recommended.  Jones is finally starting to get her due as an author, and this is a good place to start reading her works.
B000084T18|4.0|This album is tight but way too much hype. I know 50 cent is doing his thing and I wont hate on him for that. I think this cd has its strong points then its weak points. But my favorite tracks are \\"what up gangsta\\",\\"many men\\" and \\"dont push me\\". overall this cd is alright. i really love the beats in this album. If you love the hype then get it.....iight peace.
6303212379|5.0|When I told my dad once, oh, about 1987, that my goal in life was to have a real &quot;Goonie&quot; adventure, his reply was &quot;You watch too much TV.&quot; That may have been true, but I think, partly because of this film, I've retained that child-like sense of adventure well into my...Oh okay, my mid 20's! But I still remember childhood fondly whenever I watch this movie. From about the age of 7 until around 13, I was always on the lookout, on some rainy day, for a lost magical amulet or eerie looking cave. And in many ways, I still am.  I hate to get political with this, but I think that many Americans have this kind of feeling snuffed out of them once they get past 25 or so. Sure, daily American life can be draining, but this film is one of the things that inspired me to love adventure and learn to live life to the fullest. This is truly a movie to treasure with your kids, if you can get over all the foul-mouthed pre-teens (I always thought it was pretty funny, kids who were actually allowed to curse!). <BR>Watch this movie, love it, treasure it.

B000002UQJ|5.0|I'd passed up this album for a long time, primarily because it got so much bad press. Nobody seemed to like it! Now that I've heard it, this seems rather baffling. It really is a gem of an album. I think it came out at a time when Paul was taking some guff for statements he made in a Beatles biography that claimed credit over John for much of ground-breaking creativity of the Fab Four, which probably got some folks foaming at the mouth. (Even if the statements are true!)<br />Whatever the case, I found this a marvelous and mature piece of work. The first song that really caught my attention was \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" (that is, after the obvious radio hit \\"Hope of Deliverance.\\") This was also a surprise to me since I'd read an interview that specifically castigated this song. The interviewer asked, \\"How can you go from writing lyrics like 'Eleanor Rigby' to 'Biker Like an Icon?'\\" Only after I'd actually heard the song did I think back and realize how polite McCartney was in his reply. (He said something like, \\"I'm not sure. Sometimes it surprises me what people will or will not like.\\") The whole song I feel is as clever lyrically as any other McCartney song. He was definitely playing on the sound of these words on the tongue, and the idea and images it inspires are quite fun.<br />But that's just the beginning! Yes, \\"Looking for Changes\\" is quite political (trying to inspire better treatment for furry things), but no more so than his early 70s song, \\"Give Ireland back to the Irish.\\" I personally don't agree with the sentiment, but if nothing else, it's interesting to see what he can do musically with such a charged political message. <br />I also loved \\"Peace in the Neighborhood,\\" \\"Golden Earth Girl,\\" (can't get the lyric of \\"fish in a sunbeam\\" out of my head!) \\"Get out of the Way,\\" \\"Winedark Open Sea,\\" and the opening number, \\"Off the Ground.\\" <br />But the rousing finish with \\"C'mon People\\" left me in awe. He really has lost NOTHING since his Beatles and Wings days.Did this song ever reach the radio? If so, I never heard it. Just goes to show again that the youth of the world decide what we hear on the 'ole FM. ...<br />Live long and prosper, Paul. Mostly, I thank heaven that this magnificent artist continues to share his gift long after most other pop artists have gone the way of the wind.
B000002P5W|5.0|After the explosive 'Are You Experienced?', Hendrix went to work almost immediatley on his second album 'Axis: Bold as Love'.  The result was an album that streched the boudaries of musical recording further than anyone of the time.  Utilizing the recording studio as not just a place to put your music on record, but also as almost an instrument itself, Hendrix created this album with genius experimentation.  While the rockers are still here ('Aint no telling', 'If Six Was Nine', etc.) the majority of the albums' more prominent songs are his ballads ('Little Wing', 'One Rainy Wish', 'Bold as Love', etc.) which have the searching, yearning feel that Bob Dylan would use to great effect in 1975's 'Blood on The Tracks' LP.  Experience Hendrix released the original stereo format release on both CD and Cassette in 2000, but the most interesting version of this album they have come up with was their vinyl remastering of the mono release, which I own a copy of.  While the stereo mix reigns supreme, as Jimi wanted, this mono record of 'Axis: Bold as Love' is a *must-have* for Hendrix devotees.  All in all, is 'Axis: Bold as Love' a worthwhile purchase?  Absolutley, but it doesn't deserve to sit on the shelf by its self.  It is best listened to along with his other albums.  His debut, 'Are You Experienced', is another must-have for not only Hendrix devotees, but classic rock fans in general.  And no colection is complete without the follow up to 'Axis: Bold as Love', 'Electric Ladyland', the finest record of Hendrix's career.<BR>~John Ballantyne
0553577123|5.0|I read this book when I was in the eighth grade. It captivated me that such a bright, intellligent girl could have her life end in such sadness and still, have a spirit of hope and faith. To let herself dance and joke in the midst of such darkness speaks so much about the human spirit. I am glad to  have read this book, snd I have learned much ABOUT LIFE through it
B00005OM4N|2.0|Her first two albums were amazing and i could see how talented she was just by the lyrics, she introduced a whole new genre of music to the pop culture. Her first couple of hits such as \\"hit me baby one more time\\" or \\"oops i did it again\\" revealed her obvious talent and ambition and at that time she was what i like to consider, \\"underground\\", but i knew after her newfound popularity and how much all the public loved her, that her music would start to decline and it would become more commercial, just like all the other great pop artists........backstreet boys, christana agulara, 'nsync, and even the all-time pop artist....michael jackson. So all in all this album just isn't the top notch britney quality that i once knew, and thats all i gotta say..........just kidding!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I am guessing that &quot;Neato&quot; is a word that Jack White would want me to use when describing his latest album.  Let's face it, he is the talent in the band.  He writes the majority of the music and the lyrics, but that doesn't mean that Meg White doesn't earn her due.  In &quot;Cold Cold Night&quot; she delivers some light and sweet vocals to go along with a booty kickin' bass line.  Many of the songs on the album allow Jack to really reap some havoc on his electric some loud and aggressive riffs and solos.  Some of the better examples of this include &quot;Ball and a Biscuit&quot; and &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;<br />Something that I have always admired about the White Stripes is how their lyrics seem so straight forward to me.  There isn't any complicated methaphors or inside jokes.  Everything that is sung, I can understand, truly a rarity for me.  Many of the songs have simple messages, but it is these messages that I am able to understand while still trying to sort through the different levels of the music.  <br />What this album has and what makes it better than their lest offering, &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, is that it is more musically complicated and diverse.  Before many of the albums had simple drum beats (although this is still true), while &quot;Elephant&quot; breaks new ground for the Stripes by adding a bass where appropriate and an electric piano on some tracks.<br />Overall, I really feel like this is going to be one of the best albums that 2003 is going to yield.  If you like Blues-Rock such as Led Zepplin, then this album fires on all cylindars and you will not be disappointed.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is an amazing band! Hybrid Theory blew everyone away with the lyrics, and instruments. Reanimation was a great album too, it had excellent remixes. Now, their new album, Meteora, is just jaw-dropping. It has great music and vocals. Every song is spectacular. I HIGHLY suggest you pick up a copy of this CD today!
B00005QIPH|5.0|First a little back ground on the negative reviews for The Strokes.  Many dedicated fans of music seem to be divided on what to think about them.  There are those who simply won't back any band who is hyped by anybody.  Screw these people, they are too &quot;Indie&quot; for their own good.  They mostly listen to bands that almost nobody has heard of, simply for the reason that nobody has heard of them.  In addition, there is a reason that we haven't heard of them.  They aren't good.  The majority of the negative reviews for this album come from these people.  Ignore these people.  They bash most albums.<br />I believe and hope that this band plays a significant role in the shape of music for years to come.  In addition to a magnificent first album I have heard a number of the tracks that should appear on the second album.  All of these new tracks are just as good and only make me anxious for the next release.  <br />As for the album itself, I find it to be just wonderful.  Many people will argue that all of the tracks sound exactly the same.  I don't believe that this is true at all.  I believe that all of the tracks on the album have a similar sound.  This is true of many bands however, including U2 and Bruce Springsteen.  That is what makes a band distinct is the reason why people remember then 20 years from now.  I mean really, is anybody going to be able to tell the difference between Third Eye Blind, Tonic, and Sugar Ray, 20 years from now.  No.<br />What I really like about the album is the energy.  While the album is only 36 minutes long, it only seems like 20 because it is so fast.  It feels like you should be able to run kitchen appliances off of the energy this album produces.  The double guitar attack of Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. is the key to the albums energy.  While neither is pegged to be the next Jimi Hendrix, both of them possess more than enough talent to make their way through all of the tracks with adequate skill.  The skins work on FabMorretti is the driving source of the bands power and Julian Casablancas's &quot;wailing&quot; vocals tie it all together.  It is the bass work of Nickolai Fraiture that I admire the most, however.  He is one of the more talented bass players that I have heard in a quite some time.  Like other great bass players, he is asked to take on a variety of roles.  Sometimes, he is just filling in the lower notes on a chord, but on others he takes the spotlight by providing the melody on tunes such as &quot;When It Started&quot;.<br />At one point on the album it reaches a streak of 4 amazing tunes in a row.  Tracks 5-8 (Someday, Alone Together, Last Nite, and Hard To Explain) are great and maybe the best string of tunes on one album I have ever heard.  I simply cannot speak enough about this album.  If I could recommend only one album for somebody to buy it would be Joshua Tree by U2.  But if I could recommend two albums for somebody to buy, this would be the second.
0316666343|4.0|I am not a person who really believes in an afterlife. Also,I find most books about murdered children and young adults to be very explotive in nature,so I approached this book with some reservations. I was however,pleasantly suprized. I  did wanted more descriptions of Susie's \\"heaven\\" as well as maybe a less elequent tone from an girl who describes herself as being an unexpectational student and not much into writing. It's like all of a sudden she becomes this kind of prophet as a result of her death. On the postive side,I really liked the charactors and I felt that it handled the subject matter well. Overall,a good and \\"lovely\\" story..
006092988X|4.0|This book was assigned reading for a book club that I'm in, and I am glad it was or I may have overlooked it.  The reflections of the main character, Francie, create what for me is a whole other world; kind of a real-life science fiction.  This is better than sci-fi or fantasy, though, because it is a glimpse of a real time &amp; place that existed nearly a century ago.  Betty Smith writes from the heart about a place that, while holding no appearant beauty to outsiders, is glorious in the author's recollections.  It also reminds readers of what the &quot;American Dream&quot; is really made of.  The situations are wrought with love, and the characters are very real, multi-dimensional people.  I would especially recommend this book to women of all ages.
B000002AZ8|1.0|After Ten and Vs., I was expecting a lot more than this.  Vitalogy started Pearl Jam's slide into loud unimaginative &quot;by the books guitar rock&quot;.  Ten and Vs. had tremendous melodic guitars.  Vitalogy and beyond turned Pearl Jam into a loud disjointed mess.  If you're thinking about buying this CD don't.  Just get Pearl Jam's first two (Ten &amp; Vs.) and then forget about the rest of thier vastly overrated CD's.
B000000W5L|5.0|At this stage of their career, the Stones were truly The Greatest Rock n Roll Band in the World.  They could get the listener's \\"Rocks Off\\" better than any other group from this era.  The songs kick as*, one classic after another, \\"Tumbling Dice\\", \\"All Down The Line\\", \\"Happy\\", \\"Torn & Frayed\\", \\"Rip This Joint\\", you get the picture! Mick Taylor's guitar playing is so fluid and nasty! I've always considered him to be one of the best blues/rock players on the planet and this album offers ample proof.  Listen to his stinging slide on \\"All Down The Line\\" and \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" or the way he rocks out at the very end of \\"Rocks Off\\".  Outstanding riffs!  Charlie and Bill propel the music along at break neck speed and Keith rocks harder here than ever before.  Great supporting musicians...Nicky Hopkins on piano, Jim Price and Bobby keys on horns!!!  Classic stuff here.
B00005AFVR|4.0|I recently saw the DVD of this performance and was blown away. I feel the set list for the double CD is a little uneven, and the new songs don't do a lot for me. But \\"Youngstown\\"? What can I say? Nils Lofgren brings the crowd to its feet while simultaneously bringing me to my knees. Oh to play guitar like this man. In my opinion, the album is worth buying on the strength of his solo on \\"Youngstown\\" alone. I was disappointed by the new version of \\"Atlantic City\\", but then I thought, how could you possibly better the original? \\"Murder Incorporated\\" is also a standout. At the end of the day, it's Bruce Springsteen, it's the E-Street Band and it's live. It has to be good. Buy this album, then simply hit the repeat button on track 7.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I just love this music.  John Mayer has talent, a sexy voice, and such sweet lyrics.  If you're a sucker for sweet guys, like I am, or if you just like to listen to good chillin' music, buy this cd!!
B00007K08H|5.0|I described AMELIE as intimate because the film, in my opinion, speaks to us as individuals.  As all good films should, sure, but more so.  First of all, if you're not fluent in French, you're obliged to read subtitles.  I generally avoid films with subtitles.  Let's face it, when we watch a movie we want to do just that, watch it.  However, watching AMELIE was sheer joy.  It was like being absorbed in a painting by a master who uses vibrant colors on her canvas.  It was like hearing a story by someone whose voice is so mesmerizing you literally hang on every word.  I loved the simplicity of the story, the passion of the actors, the beginning, the middle, and the end of it!  It took me more than a year to finally see it.  It was worth the wait.
0812550706|5.0|The world is scared.  It is terrified.  An alien race has attacked the earth twice.  Both times humanity has miraculously escaped destruction and annihilation, but now the fate of earth is about to be decided and the final battle for humanity is about to be fought.  Who will be the savior of mankind?-Andrew Wiggins, a six-year-old boy who has been watched and raised for the sole purpose of preventing the end of humanity and forever removing the threat of an alien race.<BR> This book, Ender's Game, by New York Times best selling author Orson Scott Card, is a Hugo and Nebula Award winner which has stood the test of time among millions of readers for almost twenty years.  It is a book which has found and retained many avid fans since its first publication in 1977, which has motivated and urged Card to continue this saga into an in-depth series which takes the reader farther into the universe of Ender.  This first book of the Ender saga is an amazing novel that inspires and empowers the reader.  It allows the reader to see the innocence and simplicity of childhood, while at the same time the human nature in all of us to survive at any and all costs.  Card does an amazing job of grabbing the reader from the opening scenes and tightening his grip until the final few pages when everything comes full circle.<BR>In Ender's Game, Card introduces us to Andrew Wiggins a.k.a. Ender, a young boy who has been raised and trained from birth to be a leader, a commander and, as his name suggests, an ender to not only this war with the alien race of \\"Buggers\\", but all wars against them.  The reader and Ender simultaneously come to realize that Ender's usefulness lies in arriving to \\"the point of no return.\\"  If Ender can be made to feel like there are only two options kill or be killed-then he can thus become an impenetrable marvel in his survival. Card uses childlike precision in describing Ender's peaceful, yet volatile temper as he searches out every avenue for peace, only to find that violence, often times, is the only catalyst for this sought after peace.  Early on in the book Ender is faced with the decision of fight or flight as a gang of older boys accost him.  Knowing that running will only encourage the boys to continually antagonize him, Ender chooses to fight.  He beats the leader of the gang into unconsciousness and, when asked why he didn't stop when the boy was knocked down, Ender replies, \\"Knocking him down won the first fight.  I wanted to win all the next ones, too.  So they'd leave me alone.\\"<BR>From this, the reader may question Cards' view on violence as a solution for hostility, but perhaps he is suggesting more than what we see.  This book encourages the reader to see the sacrifice of the few for the betterment of the many.<BR> At the age of six, Ender becomes this sacrifice as he leaves his home and begins his training in battle school-a place where games are played to teach combat skills and separate the leaders from the followers.  These games, however, take on a larger meaning to Ender, who is not asked to merely lead but to win-at any and all costs, no matter the circumstance or handicap placed upon him.  Ender's ability to be manipulated in these games is carefully stretched to the breaking point by his superiors as they place him in near hopeless circumstances, only to one day help him succeed.  Ender must win these games, for one day the games will end and the real battle will begin.<BR> Sci-fi fan or not, all who read this book will find a love for Ender and his struggle with the \\"Buggers\\" and more importantly the struggle within him as he searches to find peace within himself.
B000002BMV|5.0|This record is the best album from one of the greatest classic hard rock bands ever. In the era before hair metal, AOR bands like Journey, Boston, and REO Speedwagon dominated mainstream hard rock. Punk was not the music of the day, this was. This record had everything. The band is top-notch. Steve Perry has yet to be out sung, and this remains a classic. If you listen to classic heavy/hard rock, this album should be a cornerstone of your collection.
B000000WA4|5.0|...<br />Musically, the album bounces back and forth as well.  There are extremely heavy songs (Tales of a Scorched Earth).  Slow love song types (Beautiful, Lily (My One and Only)).  Experimental, somewhat psychedelic songs (Porcelina of the Vast Oceans).  Melodic acoustic songs (Stumbleine).  Emotional, orchestrated songs (Tonight, Tonight).  Billy Corgans musical genius and versatility are proven once more with this album.<br />If you still don't own Mellon Collie after all these years, you are probably like me.  You love the Smashing Pumpkins' popular singles, and likely have them downloaded.  The problem is you don't think the other, less popular songs on the album can be nearly as good.  You (and I) are wrong!  On only my first listen, there were songs that to me were much better than many Pumpkins singles!  In fact, my favorite song on the album is one that is never played on the radio, and not very widely known.  The song is X.Y.U.  This song is, in my opinion, the best Pumpkins song.  It has a slow, heavily distorted riff that is repeated throughout most of the song, up until the bridge, where it gets quiet and Billy sings what can best be described as a rewrite of Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Then suddenly the music stops and Billy screams \\"and in the eyes of the jackal I say KAAAAABOOM!\\" and Billy and the guitars are speeding up faster and faster with the drums going crazy in the background until Billy stops it again with a gut-wrenching scream, and the bludgeoning bluesy riff from the beginning is back, with a feedback drenched solo to close out the song.  There are many other songs such as this that weren't radio hits, but instantly will grab you.  I would name some, but it would be redundant to name almost every song on the album.<br />Double albums are notorious for filler.  Even Pink Floyd had a couple small throwaway songs on The Wall.  The closest that Mellon Collie comes to filler is We Only Come Out at Night, a light hearted, sing-a-long type song that sounds even odder coming directly after X.Y.U.  As clichéd or stupid as it may sound, nearly all the songs are amazing.<br />This album is a tried and true classic, from one of the top bands of the nineties, and the best band to come from the grunge era.  No self-respecting music fan should be without it.  Fans of the less depressing Pumpkins songs should check out Billy's new band, Zwan.  Otherwise more Pumpkins greatness can be found on their other classic album, Siamese Dream.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|if you have an imagination you will like this movie. <BR>there are some beautiful fantastic settings here that really would fuel a dream. As you've probably read its a set of short stories, each one has a flare of fantasy and mystery, yes a dreamlike quality.  GORGEOUS visuals and of course, beautiful stories.<BR>I cant recommend this enough.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It's the same White Stripes you've always known.  Great garage rock mixed with folky acoustic songs.  Somewhat odd song titles and somewhat odd lyrics.  Still no bass (the &quot;bass&quot; on Seven Nation Army is actually a guitar).  And who's complaining?  Not a soul.  <br />Despite how similar Elephant is to the rest of the White Stripes catalogue (in a couple instances songs even partially use the exact same chords and melodies as songs from White Blood Cells), it does show continued musical maturation and experimentation.  In addition to longer, more creative solos, songs such as Black Math, There's No Home For You Here, and Ball and Biscuit show some changes to the White Stripes sound.  Black Math juxtaposes a punk rock chord riff with a more heavy metal sounding guitar (like the acoustic and electric in Now Mary from White Blood Cells).  There's No Room For You Here is almost a rewrite of Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground until the music breaks off and there is only feedback and the chorus sung in harmony.  Ball and Biscuit contains a classic blues riff repeated over and over, until it bursts into an amazing blistering solo.  These songs are different from the normal White Stripes formula (is there such a thing?), and provide even more evidence of Jack White's songwriting skill.<br />Some fans of the hard garage rock songs may be turned off by the softer, acoustic/piano songs on here.  There are three; You've Got Her in Your Pocket, In the Cold, Cold Night, and Well It's True That We Love One Another.  Well It's True (a country sing-a-long type song, with Jack, Meg, and Holly singing to each other about Jack's love for Holly) is the worst song on the album, because of it's novelty.  The others, however, are good acoustic songs, much like Hotel Yorba from White Blood Cells, although not as great.  Even if you don't like these types of songs, I think the strength of the electric material would outweigh the acoustic, and you would like the album anyway.<br />The White Stripes have done it again.  Another great garage rock album you can listen to on a day when you feel like banging your head and air guitaring (or playing real guitar, depending), without skipping a track.  Any fan of White Blood Cells should buy Elephant without hesitation.
B00000JY1X|5.0|In the Sixties, people used to sometimes write \\"Clapton is God\\" on the sides of buildings, so let me be the first to write \\"Merritt is God.\\"  (Though I wouldn't be surprised if somebody beat me to it.)  The sheer number of great songs in this collection is staggering.  After getting used to each volume separately, I now typically listen to the entire collection in sequence, setting aside three hours for the experience.  <br />It's amazing how consistently high the quality is here.  There are only three songs I hate--\\"Punk Love,\\" \\"Love Is Like Jazz,\\" and \\"Promises of Eternity\\"--and Merritt has gotten so far into my head that I wonder if the first two, at least, were intentionally designed to be hated.  The theme of this album is diversity, after all, and how could a 69 song collection be diverse if you liked every song?  <br />Merritt and his merry band of guest vocalists (24 songs are not sung by him) mix images of joy, sorrow, male, female, gay, straight, lust, true love, and just about anything else you can think of that has to do with romantic love.  Merritt wisely avoided trying to string the songs together thematically, instead choosing a looser approach that gives \\"69 Love Songs\\" the feel of a really good (and delightfully long) mix tape.  <br />A list of the songs I like, or even the songs I love, would be too lengthy to include here.  For example, the first eight songs on Volume One are all knockouts, and even the ninth one, \\"Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits,\\" is an amusing and entirely harmless OMD ripoff.  There are great tunes in the 80s pop mode that Merritt has always favored (\\"The Death of Ferdinand DeSaussure\\" and \\"Long Forgotten Fairytale\\" are highlights), excellent piano ballads (\\"My Only Friend,\\" \\"Busby Berkely Dreams\\"), and even some folky songs, though nothing seems too far removed from Broadway--and I usually don't even like showtunes.  Then there are true oddities like the very first track, \\"Absolutely Cuckoo,\\" which to me resembles a pop songthat has been shattered into hundreds of colorful pieces and whirled around in a kaleidoscope.  <br />Unless you're sure you're going to like this, I would suggest buying Volume One first (preferably used) and giving yourself some time to get used to it.  Songs that sound almost throwaway on the first few listens may become favorites.  If you find yourself becoming addicted to the disc, you can then trade it in and buy the entire set.  You will want the whole thing because it comes with a big fat booklet in which Stephin Merritt discusses every single song in the collection.  Considering that there are actually four albums' worth of material here (each disc is just under an hour long) it is actually a great buy.  <br />I have two other Magnetic Fields discs, \\"The Charm of the Highway Strip\\" and \\"Holiday,\\" and neither of them contain the range that you'll find here.  The sound of \\"69 Love Songs\\" is based mostly on acoustic instruments, though often they are recorded or mixed in unusual ways.  (I suspect that Merritt has Brian Eno's early albums in his collection.)  So even if you're familiar with Stephin Merritt's other work but do not consider yourself to be a fan, you owe it to yourself to give \\"69 Love Songs\\" a try.  There's nothing else like it.  You may even end up, like me, with a strange compulsion to go out and buy yourself a ukelele.
B00008GKEG|5.0|first, let me explain what significance the Beatles hold for myself and perhaps the millions of fans over the world. the beatles are quite simply the most important contribution to humanity . their efforts in the field of music are incalcuable. they arrived at a pivitol time in America. they helped us to forget the problems of that time. John F. Kennedy had only been assisignated three short months before their legendary appearance on Ed Sullivan. the country was facing the beginnings of Vietnam, racial injustice and a generation that were becoming fed up with the standards which had been laid down by their elders. it was a dreary time and the Beatles that February night with more than 70 million people watching their television sets proved that music (if only for ten brief minutes)held the potential to change the world. My entire basis of musical understanding is based on the words and music of this great band.<BR>i watched the anthology series back in November of 1995 with great anticipation. i knew that for many years this project had been in the works and that there had to have been far more material not aired over the course of that week. the purpose of the series accoring to George Harrison was to add closure for all Beatles fans but i look at this as an opening for the casual Beatles fan to come and explore what made these songs so memorable. Hours had been shaved off this series to fit within the parameters of network tv. i waited for that day to arrive when they would be released on dvd. my prayers have been answered. <BR>when you think of the great Beatles machine, their grandeur and mystique you tend not to think of the band as individual but this amazing foursome who wrote some of the greatest songs of the 20th century and perhaps rival the works of classic composers like Bach, Beethoven and Gershwin. this program is a unique and rare glimpse into the individuals minds. how they saw it and lived it. you begin to see them for their endearing qualities which only helps build your exisiting admiration for them. you'll be amazed at some of the footage you see such as their taxi ride from JFK airport to the hotel they were staying at. truely remarkable. this documentary is unparalleled and unprecendented and truely is the chronological tell all of the greatest band ever as told through their experiences and experiences of trusted aquaintances of the band. well I'm working on disc two athe moment and have another 7 1/2 hours to go not including the 90 minutes of extra footage (beyond the extra footage worked into the original documentary). long live John, Paul George and Ringo! Thanks for your lessons in melody and communication. hats off to george martin for taking that sound and formatting it for our ears.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I dont know why people hated this movie so much.  This was a wonderful movie by Stephen S. They didn't refer to the Blue Fairy too much because that's what the story was about. He wanted to become real and had heard the story so he thought the blue fairy was real. It was a beautiful movie that had me and my friends upset for weeks. This film was not recognised as much as it should have been, the trailers did it no justice and were misleading. I love this movie, you should too. (p.s.) did you know he was not allowed to blink once this entire movie. that's talent.) While I love Stanley Kub. I thought the movie was beatifully made. The aliens that everyone was complaining about at the end were advanced robots. Good for you Stephen, one day people will appreciate this movie.
B000063NPX|5.0|Having been an underappreciated bookworm and a loner-by-necessity during my own youth, I identify strongly with heroine Belle, exiled to life in a provincial French town where her inventor father struggles to create that one indispensable Thing and make his fortune, and yearning for \\"so much more than they've got planned.\\"  And who would have thought that Robby Benson would deliver so effective a performance as the voice of the Beast?  His castle full of animated furnishings (I wish they'd given more space to his valet, a hatrack, and the master cook, a stove) is splendidly imagined and animated, and, as always, there are animals--Belle's father's big draft horse and a pack of sinister wolves.  The one disappointment this movie has for me is its \\"villain\\"--Gaston may be arrogant, loutish, chauvinistic, and even cruel, but he doesn't seem evil enough to deserve the fate that befalls him.  Still, the movie has immense charm and definitely deserves the accolades heaped upon it when it was first released.  And like many Disney films, it has a subtle moral to offer: that even those who don't \\"quite fit in\\" can, with persistence, courage, and a knowledge of who they are, find the place in the world where they truly belong.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This music is universal.  We need to blast &quot;Olsen, Olsen&quot; and &quot;Svefn G Englar&quot;  into space instead of Hendrix.  Maybe then the aliens will know that intelligent life exists on earth.  Or at least something beautiful.
6305784078|5.0|(That's cat-lovers, by the way.)  Disney here remakes his canine classic with feline leads and succeeds wonderfully.  Duchess (voiced by Eva Gabor) is the pampered pet who (with her three kittens, Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse) is forced out into the cruel world, and O'Malley (Phil Harris) the gallant alley cat who comes to their rescue and wins her love.  Unlike the original, here we find a genuine villain--Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), butler to Duchess's wealthy &quot;Madame,&quot; who stands to inherit her estate after the cats have lived out their lives, and wants to hurry things up so he can get the money while he's still able to enjoy it.  With the help of Froufrou the carriage horse (Nancy Kulp), Roquefort the mouse (Sterling Holloway), and Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers) and his (jazz) band of Alley Cats, O'Malley succeeds in foiling Edgar's plot, and Edgar gets his just desserts.  True, the two hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette (Pat Buttram and George Lindsey) are a bit over-the-top (where are they supposed to be from, the South of France?), but they do provide a laugh-out-loud comic interlude.  With humor and suspense aplenty and a delightful array of characters, this movie might even convert the cat-haters in the family.  Definitely one of my favorites.
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity Has many good songs, System of a down has hit it big with this Cd, i think that it is way better than there first Cd, you should really get this one if you like Rock.
6302158095|4.0|...do I rate it at four stars.  Given that the original \\"Fantasia\\" doesn't tell a single story, as most Disney films do, but instead interprets eight distinct pieces of classical music, it's inevitable that each viewer will prefer some to others.  (Personally I fast-forward through \\"The Dance of the Hours\\" and am not particularly entranced by \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\\" but I love the \\"Pastoral Symphony,\\" \\"Rite of Spring,\\" and \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\"--what a gorgeous mountain devil!)  Deems Taylor, who was a noted music critic of the time, provides a clear and excellent narration, and of course the score is beautiful.  Interestingly, when rereleased theatrically during the hippie era, the movie was promptly hailed as a \\"psychedelic experience\\" by the counterculture, but viewing it today it doesn't seem so at all.  It may have scary moments for the youngest kids, but would serve as a good introduction to \\"highbrow\\" music if they're unfamiliar with it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ok, yeah I admit it. I did not like hybrid theory. I was just like, yeah another rock rap band. Then Re-animation came around and a few songs (points of authority especially) caught my ear. Then I heard Somewhere I belong on my local radio station and I was somewhat impressed. So I decided to get the CD. And I'll just say I'm very impressed, I think its a great CD (and I also think they could have chosen a better song for their first single ie: faint (track 7 or maybe lying from you (track 4). Their DJ has some great skills (demonstrated in track 12). The angry little skin head (Chester?) is still screaming but the other guy with the spiked hair provides great lyrical content and really flows well (demonstrated great on track 11). I am a new Linkin Park fan. On a different note, parents may not like the music style but i'm sure they would appreciate the fact I didn't hear 1 swear on the entire cd (did i just miss some?)
B00006L83N|4.0|New Jersey's Symphony X have joined a few others (Virgin Steele, Blind Guardian) giving us their latest opus based on Greek tragedy (this time it's Homer's Odyssee). These guys have delivered in a major way staying original to themselves and the sound that put them on the map, commendable these days (you listening DT?). The whole band are simply great at what they do, but let's face it, Michael Romeo makes this band! His originality and guitar wizardry is almsot unparalelled today. Indeed I would rank him up there with the world's best (guys like Yngwie Malmsteen, John Petrucci and Luca Turilli). You just have to hear it to believe it! Highlights include: &quot;Inferno (Unleash the Fire), &quot;Wicked&quot;, &quot;Accolade II&quot; (that Symphony X sound we've all grown to love), &quot;Awakenings&quot;, &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (a 24 minute epic that encompasses and showcases all that this band is and why they have become the kings of progressive metal, simply amazing!) and &quot;Masquerade&quot; (just enough for you to want more). These guys are the best at what they do... I don't know what Dream Theater and Fates Warning are thinking these days but neither have released better stuff in a long time.
B00007L4MJ|3.0|Because others have already done so, I won't elaborate on the film's visual enhancements (I agree it was an excellent tranfer to DVD with the same caveats used by other reviewers).  However, I'm baffled by the fact no one apparently wants to go out on a limb and call this what it is - union propaganda.  Could \\"Management\\" be portrayed in a more sinister light?  Could the workers have been portrayed in a more drudgelike, hang-dog fashion (or did they seem like the Israelites were portrayed while enslaved in Egypt)? Essentially the workers were awaiting their Messiah - in this case the \\"Mediator\\" (make that union boss Freder) and finally got their Mediator after the boss's son was smitten by the \\"Union Organizer\\" Maria (or Mary much like Mary the Virgin gives birth to Jesus, so Maria essentially gives birth to the Messiah (i.e., union boss Freder).  And the fact that technology (i.e., the \\"Evil Maria\\" that is the robot changed physically by the mad scientist Rotwang to resemble Maria) leads/incites the union people to commit horrible and stupid acts (much like the character in the Ten Commandments movie that incites the Israelites that followed Moses to behave poorly while Moses was away getting the Ten Commandments) was equally appalling.  I could go on but you get the drift.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The best concert DVD I've ever seen. Every second of the 5hrs 20mins is truly great! I only wish I could see or hear the entire concerts. I guess I can respect why Jimmy didn't release the entire shows on DVD(as hard that is for me). I do hope that he at least releases the entire Earl's Court and Knebworth on CD one day though, the sound is perfect on the DVD and those were pivotal Zeppelin performances. It seems a little bit silly that I'm going to have to buy the bootlegs with inadequate picture and sound to see the whole shows.
B000002HMH|1.0|The worst Metallica album to date.  Even the album's sequel Reload is better than this!  If you like The Cranberries, or Radiohead, then this album is for you, but if you like Megadeth or Anthrax, skip this one.
B00008J4P5|2.0|Now, i just bought this cd, and while the music and stuff is OK, the vocals and feel of the music stinks. I would recomend downloading &quot; seven nation army &quot; if you want the highlight of the cd. Not really that good of a cd for anyone who likes punk, metal, ..or really anything besides 70s music..
B000002HRE|2.0|Although slightly better than Load (of...) it still lacks killer riffs, and speed, which is good, if you like The Cranberries.  Not recommended if you like &quot;Puppets&quot; or &quot;Justice&quot;.
B00005JKYI|5.0|Loved it! I love any movies with dancing. Kevin Bacon is a total hottie in this flick. Has lots of humor, some drama and a lot of entertainment. Excellent cast, love John Lithgow. If you were the same age as the main characters, you can identify!
B00005K9LM|5.0|The best Priest album of all time!  If you're looking for the definite Priest sound, it's on this album. From &quot;Freewheel Burning to &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith, it's a flawless album, even the production quality is good.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Godsmack since '98 and this album is heavier than the other two. Godsmack took alot of time to write and record the album, but their hard work and efforts make it damn well worth it. I couldn't stop listening to this. The music is great. It is hard for me to choose a favorite song from this album because they all have a special unique feel to them. Like Sully singing in \\"Releasing The Demons\\" the verses are so neat the way he does it and in \\"Faceless\\" and \\"Changes\\" the chorus in these songs are really catchy. Tony's solos still kick .... Robbie is great on bass. The new drummer, Shannon Larkin, can REALLY play drums as great like Tommy. Sully hates to be lied to and his lyrics and angry voice lets you know it in \\"I F*cking Hate You\\" and \\"Straight Out of Line\\" (which I think alot of people may have heard it several times on the radio.) \\"Serenity\\" (which was influenced by the drummer of Rush.) is this album's cultural song and just like \\"The Spiral\\" is different from \\"Voodoo\\" this is different from both of them. This is performed with an acoustic guitar instead of an electric, which sounds awesome. \\"The Awakening\\" is like an African Tribal style of music with just drumming and chanting only. Godsmack really did a great job on this album. Words cannot explain this album... Anybody who likes metal can enjoy this. GET THIS!!! I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALL DAY!
0689815816|5.0|I think this is a darling story with great pictures.  My boys just love the tale, over and over and over again.  I think I will tire of it long before they will.  Its a real classic and I think it belongs in every childs library.
0679437223|4.0|Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a great book.  In the beginning, the book starts great, though it seemed that some of the jokes were no that funny.  Many of the characters were great and some of them were comparable.  There were many hilarious scenes that I thought were great in the novel.  Though at times, character's seemed very ignorant and immature.  This novel is also great, for having an aspect of how many people that are in war have.  There must be many individuals in war that might feel the way that Yossarian felt.  Though this book is a comedy, Heller made a mixture of Comedy in the beginning and Tragedy in the end.
B00005K3O4|3.0|First off, if you want to be scared, this is not the movie for you. I'm afraid its not that incredibly scary, or even suspenseful.<BR>  That said, this movie isn't a total waste of money. Predictability as well as originality are put together to make an amusing movie. The special effects aren't great compared to what they are now, but are decent for the 80s. <BR>  The basic plot-Alien Klowns cruise into the galaxy to have a quick snack. Unfortanetly, they eat humans. Two teenagers discover what's going on and go to the police, who, of course, don't believe them. Peril insues. Can the teenage boy and the one policeman that believes save the teenage girl before its too late?<BR>  The bottom line? If you want to be scared, this movie is not for you. If, however, you enjoy stupid funny movies that are too busy making jokes to explain itself, you might enjoy this one.
0786915749|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the very first book in the Dragonlance series, and if you like fantasy, it is a must read. All the characters have such great, yet differing, personalities. The book also features a lot of action scenes, whether it be hand-to-hand, or the use of magic. Be sure to read the second two books, which are just as good!
B000002BBY|5.0|The self-proclaimed \\"world's greatest band\\" might actually have a case during the mid-90's. \\"Wonderwall\\" was not only a huge success, it made oasis into a legitimate band. <br />As the follow up from their debut \\"Definately Maybe\\", \\"What's the Story(Morning Glory)\\" is truely remarkable. \\"Wonderwall\\" is perhaps the most played oasis song to date, but that's not to outdo some of the other gems on this album.<br />\\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" has to be mentioned for it almost puts you into a trance. It literally grasps you into the lyrics, and guitars, and before you know it, you know the whole song and are singing it after the 2nd or 3rd play. Another masterpiece has to be \\"Champagne Supernova.\\" This relatively long song is a perfect fit for any sit back and enjoy the scenery, soak up the sun, enjoy the fresh air, type of song. It doesn't have too hard of a sound, but it refreshingly relaxing.<br />The title track in a sense \\"Morning Glory\\" is almost like a repetitive wave of attitude of anger aimed toward a depressed hung over 20 something year old that just wants to get off his ass and make something out of his life. Liam and Noel force this concept craftfully into the song.<br />The song \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is another masterpiece of lyrically talent. It sort of tells the story of a man or women w/ many hardships in life and can't seem to be noticed by anyone. In a sense, it can be really depressing, but very symbolic as well.<br />Happier songs on the album such as \\"She's Electric\\", \\"Some Might Say\\", \\"Hey Now\\", \\"Roll With It\\", and the catcy intro \\"Hello\\" provide the album w/ a well balanced feel. I'm not saying that these four songs sound the same, each are uniquely different, it's just that they fit in a similar category and sort of the same type of message...\\"shut up, and enjoy life!\\"<br />With the exception of tracks 6 and 11 (sort of fillers or intermissions so to speak) \\"Whats the Story\\" provides 10 exceptional songs and even though you won't admit it, the word \\"oasismania\\" sorts of seeps into your brain.
B00004XMS0|5.0|Here we have it, all four Batman films all together in one DVD box set. The series started in 1989 with the original classic Batman. In 1992, the series was continued with the superior Batman Returns. In 1995, Batman's story continued, and Robin was introduced in Batman Forever. The series ended in 1997 with Batman & Robin.  Here I'll review each film, as well as the DVD.<br />Batman: Here, Batman is played excellently by Michael Keaton.  Batman must save Gotham City from The Joker (Jack Nicholson). Keaton makes a great Batman, and Nicholson is superb as The Joker. Tim Burton brings a dark visual style which I vastly prefer to Joel Schumacher's neon colored versions. Movie: (5/5)<BR>Picture Quality: The picture quality is quite good.  A few specks show up every now and then, but nothing too bad. Black level is dead on with excellent clarity.  (4.5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is excellent. It was great to hear the Batman theme with such clarity and force. A great soundtrack all around. (5/5)  Extras: The extras are some very interesting production notes, which are quite informative.  (3/5)<br />Batman Returns: The best film in the series. This time, Batman (Keaton) must save Gotham from the evil monster, The Penguin (Danny DeVito), and the slinky, mysterious Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Once again, Keaton makes an excellent Batman. DeVito is also excellent as the montrous Penguin, but it's Pfeiffer who unquestionably steals the show. Easliy the best film in the series. (5/5) Picture: Batman Returns features stunning imagery as well as some dark imagery which the DVD captures beautifully. Black level is dead on. The picture is wonderfully crisp and clear. Great all around. (5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is also great. Surrounds are used heavily and to great effect. I've never heard this film be so clear and dynamic! (5/5) Extras: Some very interesting production notes. (3/5)<br />Batman Forever: Here's where the series took a dip. Burton gaveup the directoral reigns to Joel Schumacher. This film is still pretty good, though, despite what others think. Batman is played by Val Kilmer who makes a pretty good Batman, but he's no Michael Keaton. This time, Batman must battle Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carrey). Batman falls in love with Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), and teams up with Robin (Chris O' Donnell). (4.4/5) Picture: The DVD displays stunning image quality. The colors are so vibrant and bold. Black level is dead on. (5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is incredibly clear and dynamic. Surrounds are put to heavy use. (5/5) Extras: Again, some interesting production notes. (3/5)<br />Batman & Robin:  Easily the worst of the series.  I still find it somewhat enjoyable for it's pure campiness. Now George Clooney plays Batman. Clooney's okay, but Michael Keaton IS Batman. Batman (Clooney) and Robin (O' Donnell) must save Gotham City from Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and Bane (Jeep Swanson). They're joined by Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone). (3.7/5) Picture: The picture quality is pristine, with excellent clarity.  The colors are very vibrant and bold. Black level is also dead on. (5/5) Sound: The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is very clear and dynamic. The surrounds are put to constant use. (5/5) Extras: Again, some interesting production notes. (3/5)<br />Conclusion: The Batman Legacy is worth it if you're a fan of the series, or really like the Batman character. While Batman Forever and more so Batman & Robin are a little less than perfect, the first two films are more than worth it.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Yeah, the Joy Division comparison is absurd - aside from dark & tense, there's not much in common. I was addicted to this CD for 2 weeks...BUT the lyrics are just dumb at points &quot;the subway is a porno&quot;?! & someone's &quot;in the kitchen with a culinary eye&quot;?! Come on - that's just STOOOPID!! The guitarists RARELY stray from simultaneous 8th notes & when they do it's ecstatic - FINALLY something else! The whole band really needs to take a hint from JD & be more innovative rhythmically, & the lyricist should avoid food as a topic & omit the infantile analogies all together. As for comparisons, to me, they sound more like the Chameleons UK circa 'Strange Times', & 'Untitled' could've easily been a Mazzy Star cut.
B00006678I|3.0|In the ghetto with Elvis, his mutton chops in full bloom, as hip and happening Dr. John Carpenter (!), befriending a trio of nuns (Mary Tyler Moore, Barbara McNair, Jane Elliot) on a plainclothes mission for God. Before taking their vows, the novices have been ordered to take a walk on the wild side, late-Sixties style, with all the trite social commentary and mild sexual titillation a G rating will allow. As comely, full-lipped Sister Michelle, MTM joins the short list (with Julie Andrews and Sally Field) for the title of Hollywood's Most Wholesomely Hot Sister. Naturally, El is smitten with her and can't figure out why she would choose a life of poverty, chastity and obedience over his funky world of howlingly cartoonish ethnic stereotypes, perverts and other fun types.<br />After this one, Elvis had the good sense to rip up his Screen Actors Guild card. Everybody say \\"Amen!\\" But seriously, it's a shame El's last feature film came a cropper. Buoyed by the success of his 1968 comeback special, the Big E looked fitter, less stoned and more handsome (sideburns notwithstanding) than he had in years. Elvis reportedly valued credibility as a serious actor over his natural gifts as a singer/entertainer. Instead of giving him a challenging role worthy of his born-again confidence, \\"Change of Habit\\" remains infamous for miscasting Elvis at a time when he was primed and ready to prove himself as an actor. Too bad.<br />The flick IS watchable for its gallery of familiar faces, among them porcine character actor Robert Emhardt (immortal as blustery businessman Malcolm Tucker in \\"The Andy Griffith Show's\\" most essential episode, \\"Man in a Hurry\\") hamming it up as a crime kingpin. And the cop that looks remarkably like Ed Asner really is him. How both Asner and MTM managed to escape from the abyss of one of Elvis's most misguided films, only to achieve nirvana in a certain Minneapolis newsroom just a year later, is impressive and miraculous.<br />This being one of Presley's \\"serious\\" movies, the soundtrack is lean, but there is one bizarro musical highlight: a piano-pounding Elvis jamming with MTM, self-consciously fingering a classical guitar like a doe caught in the spotlight, on what sounds like \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy.\\" It's a mind-blowingly surreal scene every card-carrying pop culture junkie should see once. And once is definitely enough.erious\\" movies, the soundtrack is lean, but there is one bizarro musical highlight: a piano-pounding Elvis jamming with MTM, self-consciously fingering a classical guitar like a doe caught in the spotlight, on what sounds like \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy.\\" It's a mind-blowingly surreal scene every card-carrying pop culture junkie should see once.

B00003000M|2.0|It seems there are many reviews on this album portraying it as great, excellent, and many other words communicating appreciation for this album. I must disagree. I have been listening to Bob Marley for many years and I think anyone that is a true fan of Bob Marley's music will not appreciate this album. I have heard plenty of mixes with Bob's music in the past and yes some of them very good. However, in this album most songs have too many artists throwing in their own lyrics along with Bob's which is a true disappointment. His words speak for themself and anyone that knows his music I think would agree. Don't get me wrong it's inevitable that songs get remastered, redone, etc. as time goes on. When this happens the remade version should do the song justice, not ruin it. What is the version of Rebel Music on this album!? It sounds nothing like the original with additional lyrics that do nothing for the song. I know they are trying to pay tribute to Bob, but it did not come out right with this album. If you are looking for an album that is not truly Bob Marley then run out and buy this one today. If you are looking for music that is really Bob Marley and does his music justice then save your money and get one of his classics.
0140441166|5.0|When I read Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel, \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" (which retains its French title in the 1961 English translation by P W K Stone), I found myself amazed and thrilled by its absolute excellence of execution. Its energy and spirit, and the seductive and machiavellian - perhaps even diabolical - undertones which whisper throughout the work, urge the reader ever onwards in the best page-turning tradition. It is possibly not for nothing that the book itself was eventually decreed 'dangerous' by French officials a full 42 years after it first appeared, long after it might have been expected to have lost its ability to shock. Even if you have seen the films \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" (dir. Steven Frears) or \\"Valmont\\" (dir. Milos Forman) based on the book - and whether or not you liked them - this is an outstandingly good novel which is beautifully served by the precise and graceful prose of its translator, whose subtle range of diction manages to convey the tones and tempers of the characters most convincingly. The written story's chief virtues - a compelling narrative drive, and a skill in characterisation which permit some superbly-observed insights - easily withstand comparison with the screen versions; even today, when we are so fully exposed to the diverse secrets of the psychiatrist's confessional and the details of all the world's vicissitudes and miseries, it would be hard to improve on their portrayal here in print.<br />The book succeeds so well for many reasons. Some of its appeal to a sophisticated (or at least blasé) modern audience is, I believe, the multi-layered cynicism of its vainglorious but not unattractive main characters and rivals, the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte (viscount) de Valmont, a reminder that profound deceit is not the sole prerogative of the post-industrial era. Part of the reader's amusement is to observe how their egotism - by far the most easily-wounded of their sensibilities - is also an exercise in the deception of themselves as well as of all those with whom they have dealings. Equally, their wily scheming and duplicity simultaneously appal the reader while also appealing to any secret desire he might himself harbour to exercise his or her own will with equal freedom and with equal heedlessness of conscience or consequences, thus planting a distinct ambivalence in his breast. This effect is augmented by the shifting first-person narrative, a device which gives the voices of its protagonists an intimate (and often touching) immediacy and multiplies the scope for irony by giving the reader a consistently better view than the characters, to which the skilful interweaving of the sub-plots also contributes. I should mention that the novel is written entirely as a sequence of letters. This format was common in the 18th century when the book was written, but its relative rarity in modern fiction makes its appearance today refreshing. That it is overtly concerned with the sexual seduction of the weak by the strong partially disguises the fact that it is also a philosophical novel whose themes would easily form the subject of more general discussion. As a depiction of the relations between individual human beings, it is, to be sure, a study of calculating spiritual emptiness, but one which does not shy from laying bare the catastrophic consequences of the conspirators on their victims, just as the report of a war correspondent might describe in detail the horror of a bomb explosion in a hospital. \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" not only contains plenty of anguish on the part of its characters and an affecting deathbed scene, but the reader's own emotions are made to oscillate intensely throughout from amusement to arousal, from curiosity to incredulity, from admiration to dismay... all thanks to the superb manipulation of Laclos, whose mastery of both narrative and reader is absolute and, perhaps, somewhat unsettling. (But how I wish he had written more!)
B000007VDT|4.0|This album is absolutely amazing in every way you look at it. You can never get tired of it. I bought this record right when it came out in 1997, and it is still a Cd that I play regularly. Richard Ashcroft's lyrics are pure genius, and Nick McCabe's guitar parts are classic. If you don't have this album then buy it now! I promise you it will be money well spent.

B00000DOZ6|5.0|With this 1973 album Led Zeppelin continues to cause trouble by offering an album cover by Hipgnosis with naked blonde children climbing a bunch of rocks without any reference to the title or even the name of the band. The group figured everybody would know about \\"Houses of the Holy\\" and insisted on finding new ways of tweaking their noses at the music business beyond producing songs that were way too long for AM Top 40 airplay. There were those of us who were just happy that there was an official name to Led Zep's fifth album after the previous one was known variously as \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" \\"Runes\\" and \\"ZOSO.\\" \\"House of the Holy\\" is very similar to that album in that once again there are no length blues tracks as you would find on their first three albums, although we do have John Paul Jones playing with his synthesizer on \\"No Quarter,\\" which became his signature song. What we do have are more examples of Led Zep's version of rock 'n' roll where the bass lines and Bonzo's drumming come up big with \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Dancing Days,\\" as well as the folk influence on the acoustic beginning to \\"Over the Hills and Far Away.\\" We even have one of the better examples of Led Zep being cute with \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" (\\"Me wife is going on vacation\\" \\"Jamica?\\" \\"No, she's going of her own free will...\\") and the group's first attempt to try to duplicate the success of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with the lush synthetic strings of \\"The Rain Song.\\" Actually, I think the opening track, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is a better effort along those lines, covering much more ground both musically and vocally. You always get the feeling that Jimmy Page is always looking for the perfect song to not only start off an album but to open a concert, which probably makes it ironic that the song they apparently used most often was \\"Rock and Roll,\\" the second track from their fourth album. Overall, \\"Houses of the Holy\\" is probably the best of the second level Led Zeppelin albums
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Godsmack has a proven formula and they do not deviate from that on Faceless.  If you're a fan of their self titled debut and of Awake, then you should enjoy Faceless just the same.  Tony Rombola's riffs are ever present throughout every track, providing that signature Godsmack sound.  New drummer Shannon Larkin is just as awesome as their previous drummer and bashes those skins very skillfully. I recommend this CD big time!

B00008GKEG|5.0|I was beginning to wonder if this documentary would ever be released on DVD. Most recent reviews of this documentary by those who had seen it were beginning to wonder if the Beatles were planning to have The Beatles Anthology music albums released onto 8-Track. Since the death of the Laserdisc player, the only way one could purchase this wonderful documentary was only on VHS tape for many, many years.<br />For those who are asking, \\"I saw the three part documentary on ABC in 1995. I wonder what the expanded version is like?\\" Answer: If you loved watching The Beatles Anthology on television, and taped it, and watched it many times over, you'll love this documentary which is longer than 11 hours, including the fifth disc with previously unreleased material. Most of what was cut from the ABC broadcast were musical collages similar to the \\"In My Life\\" footage that appeared at the beginning of both the Television and Commercial Free versions. Also cut were old TV appearances in part or in whole by the Beatles. And also cut were interview sequences with the Beatles where they went into greater detail about their history. And finally, also missing from the ABC broadcast were what the Beatles referred to as \\"Taped TV Promotional Films\\" of their music -- We Can Work It Out, Day Tripper, Paperback Writer, Rain.  Watching all of the various perfomances reminded me of the first time I saw these about 15 years ago on a two hour VHS tape of various performances by the Beatles.  The video was of very poor quality, looking like a copy of a copy of a copy.  This DVD is like looking at those same performances, only in pristine, mint condition.<br />If you have to choose between the unwieldly hardcover coffee table book and this new DVD video, pick the one that comes alive with music and words by the greatest rock group of the 20th century.<br />As for the additional fifth disc, this was a lot of fun to watch too. The disc contains the \\"Real Love\\" video, which was not part of the earlier commercial versions available. Mostly, this disc is the behind the scenes for the behind the scenes documentary made in 1995. At the end of one of the segments, the surviving three Beatles announce that this is their \\"Candlestick Park\\". Like always, the Beatles knew how to go out with a bang and not a whimper.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've done my homework on this band before I bought the cd.  This was the first cd I've bought in years and I'm waiting patiently for them to come to my town.  To me this has sensual seducing female vocals sung with tons of harmonizing.  It has a lighter goth feel.  Every song is superb in its execution and delivery.  Ben and Amy poured thier hearts out on this one.  Origin was not nearly as good.  They have grown as artists and I await impatiently for the next album!!!  I think this band has a sound that everyone can appreciate and will love.  I think songs like \\"Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\" can make even the strongest heart feel what Amy is singing about.  \\"Haunted\\" has the perfect title with an spooky feel to it but awesome song!  These guys can go from slow to hard in a drop of a hat and still make it to where you can understand those beautiful vocals.  GO BUY THE CD!!!
0812550706|4.0|Born August 24, 1951 in Richmond, Virginia, Orson Scott Card volunteered as a Mormon missionary in Brazil and taught at various universities and writer workshops.  In this particular book, Orson combines an advanced science and fictional society on Earth that are in significant need of help.  It is 2070, forty years since a devastating alien invasion was barely turned back, and the world is desperately searching for soldiers to lead them to victory when the \\"Buggers\\" return.  They are drafting young children who pass an arduous screening, and sending the best of them to the orbiting Battle School.  Out of the incessant pressure of military training comes six-year-old Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin.  Ender struggles to keep his humanity, as the adult teacher and rival students threaten to destroy him.  As the best of the best, Ender Wiggin, is forced to undergo isolation, physical and emotional adversities, and separation from all he has loved.  His genius raises him to the top of then intensely competitive games it the Battle Room.  His real struggles are off the playing field, with a dangerous older boy, Bonzo Madrid, who is determined that both he and Ender cannot survive in this place, with his teacher Mazer Rackham.  As humanity pins its hopes on one boy, life takes a different toll for Ender Wiggin as situations intensify.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|I just got Faceless today. What a good album!  Amazon's review is right.   <br />Most people will know \\"I Stand Alone\\" from the Scorpion King soundtrack.  I have to admit I was a little bit mad when I saw this song was on the album, but after hearing all the other songs, I think it fits in pretty well with the other 11 songs.<BR>\\"Straight Out Of Line\\" does sound pretty radio-friendly, with the catchy verses.  The title track is pretty good also.<BR> <BR>Call me crazy, but overall, the best song here just may turn out to be the last one, titled \\"Serenity\\".  The acoustic guitars are a nice break from the heavy electric guitars that are so prominent throughout the other parts of the record.  And they have a kind of haunting quality to them, which I personally like.<br />I don't know, but the only thing that might surprise people is the 11th track, \\"The Awakening\\".  The chanting might turn some people off, but the percussion work is actually quite nice.<br />Godsmack's vocalist Sully Erna-like has been said here at Amazon-sounds like James Hetfield from ten or fifteen years ago.  At least he doesn't just scream constantly, like some other hard rock/metal bands.<br />The only reason I didn't give the album 5 stars is I never give an album 5 stars for any reason (except if it's a Led Zeppelin album, but that's another story).<br />So that's my review of \\"Faceless.\\" Don't take my word for it, but give the samples a listen and I think you'll agree.
B00005T33W|5.0|From a teenager's perspective - being in the midst of everything Enid hates - Ghost World didn't really make sense to me at first. Its blatancy annoyed me, but I found myself returning to watch the movie over and over again because underneath the anti-social humor, there is an undeniable truth. After viewing it five times, I understand why Ghost World is so magnificent. This is a movie stripped of any false emotions. It may be frustrating since all the characters are so damn intelligent, but that's the beauty of it. I love this movie because it presents brilliant, lovable loners, and you can't help but misunnderstand them at first, but the more you watch this movie and the more you are willing to understand the quirky characters, you will finally realize that people like Enid are the few precious gems we have left in this corrupted society.
B000068CNX|4.0|Many celebrities make guest appearances on the second season after they had such high aclaim the first season it seemed impossible to top it. But the second season was just as good if not better than the first season of friends.<br />We watch as Monica deals with the love of an older man, Joey gets a job on Days of Our Lives, Chandler makes is corny jokes, Pheobe is clueless but not and Ross and Rachel try together but they can becuase of many problems. It's the journey through these six characters that makes it so interesting to watch because we can all relate to one or more of them.<br />Bottomline: Freinds season 2 is the next thing to get after season 1.
0060207051|5.0|My mother bought this book in a set for our oldest son (then 2).  As he made the transition to being in a big bed, being a big brother, and moving into a new house I found that this book was a comfort for him.  In fact, we had to buy another one because he loved the first one to pieces (literally!!).  Everynight our ritual was to read this book right before he laid his head down and in a few short weeks began \\"reading\\" the book to me first and now he wants to read it to his younger brother before he goes to sleep.  I am amazed at how much he loves this book and even though he hasn't read it in at least 3 months he still remembers almost every word in the book.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Dont we all wish we had lived Forest Gump's life. I mean this guy did everything even though he is mentally not all there. It's a heart warming story to watch Gump through all the hard times he faces yet goes on with his smile telling his life story to complete stangers on a bench. The 60's thru the 90's are covered by Forest Gumps life story. This movie will last a long time just because generations from now will watch it and see what the past times we like. <br />Bottomline: This is a must have for any movie collector and/or Tom Hanks fan (becuase he was great in it)

B000002NZO|4.0|I have always had a tendency to favor early albums of bands, and Genesis is no exception. Trespass is truly the birth of the Peter Gabriel-era Genesis sound. Every song on the album is quality. But there are a few blemishes which keep this album from the pantheon of masterpieces that follow.<BR>   <BR>    First of all, despite the amazing (and often overlooked) studio innovations, such as the organ solo in Stagnation which bends around like a synthesizer by manipulation of the tape pitch control, and Peter Gabriel's ring-modulated voices on The Knife, this record was poorly recorded. The acoustic guitar things sound gorgeous, but the levels were not hot enough going to tape, hence the terrible hiss on the soft sections. There are a lot of tape dropouts throughout the album. This may be due to bad quality master tape. Trident Studios normally churned out excellent-quality tracks in the 1970's, but this is quite a disappointment. There are some bad tape splices, such as the transition in Stagnation into &quot;wait, there still is time...&quot; and of course, the drums.<br />    The drums are the main reason this record suffers. For starters, John Mayhew plays drums like a high-school garage band drummer, pounding out repetitive and tasteless fills on almost every other bar. His toms are tuned too low and boxy for the style of music. Those tom sounds belong on a KISS album. They overpower everything due to too much woofiness and presence. This album is mixed beautifully in places, but when it's bad, it's BAD.<br />Bottom line: The best parts of the record are the parts without drums. Ant Phillips is a great acoustic guitarist, the lyrics are breathtaking, Tony's organ and Mellotron are glorious, Mike's bass and guitar playing are as solid as ever, and Peter sings his heart out. <br />This could have been in the top ten Genesis albums had Phil Collins played the drums, and the engineer had been more careful about levels. Could have been mastered better.<br />Still a must-have album for any fan of early-70's creative music!!<br />Was there not supposed to be a remastered version of this released on Atlantic records?
0553296981|5.0|It was interesting reading Anne Frank's Point of views to the holocaust in her diary. I got more of a sence of what was happening during this frightening time period and what it was like to hide behind a bookcase for 13 months. She said that the Natzi's would make them stand in a line for hours so they could count to make sure that everyone was there and nobody had escaped. They would go to bed and freeze and depend on body warmth. She said children asked the officers where their parents were and the officers pointed to the chimney and said there are you're parents and you will be there too. She described how when children took showers they never came back because the showers were really gas chambers. She said when she was working in the field she saw men, women, and children collapse in the field and see dead bodies be thrown in the ground. Before she and her family went into hiding, she was talking about hanging out with a boy named Harry who she liked a lot and how times were great. She was a mischevious girl just like all girls. Talking about boys, worrying about exams, teasing the siblings and more. But when she was in the camp, she was lonely, frightend for her life and her families praying that they would make it out ok. But today we know that only one person of her family survived. And that was her father. I highly highly recomend this book,it will take your breath away!!! When you read this book you will visualize it and say wow this really happend in the world.
B00003CWTI|5.0|First, as a DVD the video and audio trasfer are excellent and the film diary is interesting and informative. In general good but not exceptional features.<br />As for the film, simply astonishing. I am not one to sit through a three hour, ten minute film easily yet was transfixed from the first frame. The plot is a series of orbiting stories that come together in a themeatic way that is satisfying.<br />The score is excellent as are Amiee Mann's songs. Of particular interest was the section where the film breaks the third wall (theater talk for intentionally connecting to the audience by looking or interacting with them) by singing along to the soundtrack. It sounds hoaky but was dramatically effective and touching.<br />The complexity of the plot may cause some desire to see Magnolia a few times which is the best reason I can give to purchase the DVD.<br />Jason Robards, Tom Cruise...actually the entire ensemble act their hearts out with Cruise playing against type as a video infomercial jerk. Each story is bittersweet yet intertwine into a logic specific to the film. Most important, the characters are three dimensional. You feel the sadness and are able to extrapolate the humor and irony within Magnolia.<br />The general atmosphere is moderately dark and framed well to set the styles of each story within the superstructure of the main film.<br />This is a excellent film that may require some effort on some people's part. Some friends won't bother when they hear the running time but it's really their loss as this is a film of powerful emotions and resolutions sometimes not happy. If you enjoy stylish films - stylish, not slick Hollywood - this should appeal to you.
0515125024|4.0|DIE TRYING is Lee Child's second novel featuring his tough as nails hero, Jack Reacher.  Once again Jack is caught up in events that don't concern him.  While walking down the street minding his own business, Jack gets scooped up in the kidnapping of a young woman who is more than she seems.  I liked that Child switched the narrative from 1st person, in Killing Floor, to 3rd person.  It gives the reader a chance to see the problem through several perspectives.<br />What can I say about Jack?  He's cool as hell.  He certainly has a heart and a conscience but it doesn't stop him from being ruthlessly brutal when the situation calls for it.  If Jack Reacher tells you he's going to kill you, start digging your grave.  I especially enjoyed the way he dispatched a would be rapist.  While about to kill him with a swift and lethal blow, Jack decides that would be too good for him and suffocates him instead.<br />Child can be overly descriptive when it comes to weaponary and shooting.  I don't need a page and a half explaining the chemical reaction that occurs when a bullet is fired.  That kind of writing is best left to Stephen Hunter, who is a master at it.  Another small criticism is in the ending.  Jack is left standing on the side of the road with his clothes in tatters and presumably without a dime in his pocket.  It made me think of the ending of THE ROAD WARRIOR.  After all that occurs in the story would the FBI simply wave goodbye?  I don't think so.<br />Still, none of these prevented me from reading a thoroughly enjoyable thriller with an extremely intriguing hero.  I look forward to reading more of Jack Reacher's adventures.
B00008AWOD|5.0|The first time I heard this album i loved it, predictable maybe since i own everything they have ever done and rate them as one of the greatest bands of today, but i do find it hard to believe that even someone who doesn't like brian's voice could argue with his lyrics and the musical talents of steve and stefan. This album is both a progression form black market music and a reflection of all three past albums culminating a unique placebo sound. saw them live on monday and the album rocks live too, there is just no denying, placebo are amazing and i challenge anyone to give any good reason why this album is not the album of the year, already i can't wait for the next xxx
0316666343|2.0|I'm another sucker who bought this book due to the hype.The concept sounded interesting enough to me. After reading straight through it until sunrise, I wondered why I just wasted 13 bucks. It wasn't all bad. There are some memorable, if not believable characters. The plot has just enough suspense and surprise thrown in to keep you turning the pages long after your body feels the need rest. However, that \\"page-turner\\" phenomen alone does not a good book make.<BR>1. THE ENDING. When I finallly finished, I was so mad at the way it ended I threw it against the wall. Major Conflicts are resolved with coincidence, a mistake any published author should know to avoid(it happens more than a few times in the book now that I think about it). It just ends too neatly, and some characters attitudes change for seemingly no reason, with no conflict or resolution. After over 300 pages of suspense, you get a really weak ending. Its kind of like waiting in line for over an hour, then riding Space Mountain at Disney World.<BR>2. The language. Scattered throughout the book are signs of the author attempting to sound witty or clever. Instead we get the clear sign of a hack, desperately in need of a cliche to keep her from drowning in a sea of non-imagination.It makes me think she should attend a few poetry slams to get some creativity in her veins. <BR> I wonder who edited this? A lot of the story is written way too passively, and she over uses the word had (had been, has been). It seems like amateur editing.<BR>3. Memoir-fiction. This is a somewhat new style of ficton emerging over the past 2 decades, which I have nothing against. I thoroughly enjoyed the SECRET LIFE OF BEES. But the memoirs disguised as flashbacks in this story are dull, forced-sentiment. The only points when you care about any of these memoirs, is when it is something that would be exciting under any circumstance (First Kiss, Choking Brother, etc.)<BR>4. Structure. Sebold abruptly changes from what is current to flashbacks,from one character's Point-of-view to another's, with neither rhyme nor reason. After a while, this gets really annoying. <br />TIP: If you really must read this book, wait until it comes out on paperback or arrives at your library. You will probably be dissapointed and in want of a refund if you gamble on it now.

B00008NRLX|4.0|After two very disappointing and weak albums in form of \\"Sound of lies\\" 1997 and \\"Smile\\" 2000, it seemed that departure of Mark Olson left Jayhawks in the musical land of mediocrity. But the band have returned with their strongest album since \\"Hollywood town hall\\" from 1992. <br />\\"Rainy day music\\" is certainly an album similar to the early musical direction with a fair amount of country. This is alternative country/americana of highest quality, equally great as Whiskeytown's finest moments. As \\"Stumbling through the dark\\" begins, it's clear that Jayhawks finally have gotten back to their roots. This release is full of catchy and melodic tunes with beautiful vocal harmonies and arrangements. Just listen to \\"Tailspin\\", \\"Save it for a rainy day\\", \\"Angelyne\\" and \\"Will I see you in heaven\\" among others, and you'll discover that Jayhawks might have released the album of the year.<br />I just hope this album get the recognition it deserves!
B00005GL0N|4.0|Well, I can't help myself - Mr. Moonlight, Rock&amp;Roll Music and I'll Follow The Sun are my three favorite tracks (in that order) from this I-don't-know-why underrated, but nonetheless great album. Everybody's throwing off Mr. Moonlight, but that's one of Lennon's strongest, most inspiring vocal performances ever (yes, EVER) and a great song. I think that Carl Perkins' covers are a bit hasty; they certainly don't have the powers of the originals, neither instrumental nor vocal, and that's why I'm givin' this record a four-star mark. George obviously didn't get the words to Everybody quite right, but never mind - it's a beautiful rock&amp;roll record and some kind of a new ground - country music is all over it. And there's more country music on &quot;Help&quot; (1965). John got very introverted for that one and he's done a great job, although he sounds a bit too self-pitying sometimes. But don't worry about it - buy the album and enjoy it!
B000089RVX|5.0|its about time a female with an excellent voice rocked it
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Faceless is another great Godsmack album. I was not disappointed. Great songs and it rocks.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This one is still spinning in my player after four months, so it has reached the point of being my favorite album of 2002.  This is a moody, atmospheric, beautifully layered album.  I would struggle to pick a favorite song, but there are several truly outstanding tracks here.  An amazing accomplishment.
6305161992|2.0|If you're out to collect all of Brandon Lee's work, this is an essential. If not, you may want to pass. While the martial arts work is slick, and the dialog is peppered with some good humor, the plot is rather lacking. To top it off, Stephen Glantz (writer) has apparently never actually spoken to a woman, because he certainly can't write for them. Tia Carrere is utterly wasted (yes, even for her skills, this is a waste) in the most unrealistic female character in film. Even her nude scenes are a body double.<BR>If your looking for martial arts action you haven't already seen, you could get this one. Just don't get your hopes up.
B0000844IT|5.0|I love the Evil Dead trilogly so naturaly it gets 5 stars. The DVD is not bad but nothing to write home about. It is a to disc set, The first disc i the best becouse it has it in widescreen or fullframe with Orignil ending, Trailer Talent bios, and a [really good] behind the scene featurette. However the sceond disc is just the bootleg edition just retilte to dirctor's cut. So if you do not already have Army of Darkness on DVD(shame on you) then this is the one to get.
B000089RVX|1.0|This CD is pretty terrible. The fact that this music has been around for years and it just now becomes a hot item to own. That is BS. Closed minded people only buy music they hear on the radio. All I have is two words for Evanescence - LACUNA COIL. True there are other EURO-GOTH bands like Lullacry for example and many others. But in my opinion when it comes to GOTH music, Lacuna Coil takes the cake. They have great, heavy guitars, 2 singers 1 male and 1 female and good mood settings in their music. Lacuna Coil has been doing for years what Evanescence is trying to do now. If Lacuna Coil was played on the radio then all of these Bandwagons would jump all over something else. Basically what it comes down to is Evanescence is not the American answer to European Goth Metal. I am American and proud to be, but in music, the Europeans just now how to put songs together better. If you like Evanescence, look for Lacuna Coil or even Lullacry. They are both ten times better and more enjoyable to listen to.
B000066NW0|1.0|Now, I've listened to this CD a few times. I actually risked my hearing to rate the songs.<br />Losing Grip: 0/10. Awful sound and boyband lyrics.<BR>Complicated: 0/10. The most annoying song created. It has the strangest melody.<BR>Sk8er Boi: 0/10. There's something wrong with the title. Why can't you people write it as \\"Skater Boy\\"? Quit mutilating the English language! Um, anyway, it's so...Blink 182.<BR>I'm With You: 0/10. Terrible lyrics.<BR>Mobile: 0/10. Kinda reminds me of \\"Losing Grip\\".<br />Unwanted: 0.5/10. Oh, come on. I have to give this song a little bit of props. Unwanted, that's how she is in the punk scene. Unwanted. :)<BR>Tomorrow: 0/10. Sheesh. This title reminds me of \\"Annie\\". Has bad lyrics and rhythm.<BR>Anything But Ordinary: 0/10.<BR>Things I'll Never Say: 0/10.<BR>My World: 0/10.<BR>Nobody's Fool: 0/10.<BR>Too Much To Ask: 0/10.<BR>Naked: 0/10.<br />(I just got lazy. :)<br />Avril Lavigne really is terrible. I would've given her NO STARS if it were a choice... My sister has this CD and I decided to listen to it. When I did, I found a great excuse to be deaf. She's terrible! Her voice is mediocre, her songs are pestiferous, and her attitude is horrid. I bet she listens to Sum 41 and Blink 182 and shops at Hot Topic. Why do you people think she's so popular? Fanatics of Britney Spears, Good Charlotte, Pink, *NSYNC, etc. listen to her. THAT'S WHY. She can't even pronounce David Bowie's name correctly. Calm down, teeny boppers. Stop with the \\"NO NO!  AVRIL IS A PUNK, SILLY!!!!1 LOL!!11.\\" She isn't punk and she isn't hardcore... She claims that she plays guitar, but I haven't seen her. Well, if you call someone who only strums a few chords a guitarist then, yes, she is a \\"guitarist.\\"  She doesn't write her own songs.  She CO-WRITES the lyrics and people write the songs.<br />All in all, Lavigne and her fans are offensive to the punk scene...
0345451325|3.0|I'm a sci-fi fan, and I like what I see in this book.  It's a little light on reading, but I rarely expect books based on games to be literary works.  Halo is simply one of the best games I've ever played, and to see the backstory of the SPARTAN II program and how Reach fell puts things into place for me.  If you're a Halo fan, pick this book up.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|If you don't belive me, listen to track #7.<br />Several of the songs on this CD try to evoke emotion, put fall flatly on their collective face.  I don't blame the vocalist(s), but the struggle to phonetically get through the English lyrics is at times amusing.  In contrast (and in all fairness), the two tracks that are in Russian, in my opinion, are far more provoking.  It's a shame that the marketing machine has managed to bury their talent.
0790729628|2.0|You know, I love Blade Runner. It's one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen period.  It also had this film noir quality with the voice-over.  It was dark, it was gritty, it was brutal. I loved it for the cinematic masterpiece it was.<BR>   But the Director's Cut doesn't have the voice-over.  For me, this kills a lot of the gritty crime-story drama that the movie originally had.  I would love to get my hands on a DVD of the orignal cut of Blade Runner, because I like it a lot more.

B00005JLK1|2.0|Terrible! [Bad]! 2 stars for the beginning only. Score: 33/100
0060512806|5.0|Let me start by saying that this wasn't the book that I was expecting it to be. While that may be the case, it was indeed a very, very good book, and I think it probably turned out better than what I had expected. <BR>     <BR>By the title alone, one could be lead to believe that the entire book centers around cryptography. This isn't quite the case, though it is a major part of the book. In truth, it's more of a tale about a small group of people during world war two, and the way the lives of their descendants later on cross paths with the history of their relatives. Each generation it's own cryptological problems, though, as well as groups of people attempting to stop them from their goals. <br />As such, it's not overly topheavy with cryptology-related facts that might bore most readers. This isn't to say there is none at all for those who are interested in such things. One part of the book revolves around a rather clever cryptosystem based around a pack of cards. Much to my delight, this system was described in detail in an appendix by none other than Bruce Schneier, a name that cryptography enthusiasts everywhere will no doubt recognize. <br />The tale unfolded at a good pace, though the page count might lead you to think otherwise. It was a very lengthy book, but that only gave me all that much more time to enjoy it. The length is reasonable when you consider that the book is really the stories of two different groups of people in two different times, each one having a story that was possibly worthy of a book by itself.<br />On the whole, I'd rank it among the best books I've ever read. After a glance at the other reviews on this page, I don't seem to be alone in that ruling.
0316666343|1.0|Okay, this is going to be quick review because I am still amazed to find this book on the New York Times Best Seller list.  I read it.  I closed it up and returned it to the library.  Like other reviewers, I don't understand why it's been so popular.  It's an okay book.  Nothing great and certainly nothing that will live for years.  Of course a review is simply one person's opinion and that's mine.  Whether this helps you or not, I don't particularly care.  Just had to speak my mind after all these months!  :o)

B00008URYM|2.0|I'm a big fan of Madonna's and I will always support her, but that doesn't mean I like everything she puts out. While I respect the fact that she pulled the American Life video for the respect of U.S. soldiers or not wanting it to be misunderstood, I think the song itself is pretty lame and boring.It sounds very B-side(if anyone still know the word..... you know what I mean).  When more than 75% of the songs on the chart  is Hip-Hop or R&B, and 90% of the #1 songs in the past couple of years have been Hip-Hop influenced, Hearing Madonna rap or let Missy Elliot to remix the song and be in it makes me feel like Madonna is trying so hard to make a hit. Now Missy musta been honored to remix Madonna's song, but the remix isn't that great either( which is not on this single, but  is on the maxi due out later this month). This makes me sad. I could be wrong, but Madonna can do whatever she wants and this is what she did?<BR>I think she's feeling pressure of having to make a hit, because she's Madonna and all. I don't know. I should not say 'til I hear the album. But the song is not so great. but still get the single because there is Calderon-remixed house version of Die Another Day and enhanced web sight material. It's more like a collector's item.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Again Harry Potter has hit the top of my list. (This coming from a 17 year old female) Anyways, the movie did lack certain scenes and interactions from the book. But overall the screenwriters did a nice job of pulling the movie together. This movie I would not reccomend to younger viewers, it had many a small child crying in theaters when a Basilisk reared it's magnificent, but terrifying head. Overall this movie was quite a thriller and a great new addition to my growing Potter collection.

0783227019|4.0|I did not hear of this movie at all until it was displayed behind one of the cashier' display cases where they keep some stuff to show and I took immediate interest. It's a good movie but when I read the back and heard of the so called &quot;sequel to scarface&quot; quote on the back since the same director did the same movie I was excited to put this on. It's not the second scarface and frankly if you seen scarface...there will never be another scarface. I did take the quote lightly but this movie was about a man getting away from the life of intimadation, violence, and all the other stuff by getting caught with his past. It's still worth the watch if you were a fan of Scarface or a Pacino fan like me!
B00006LPER|4.0|Well, I finally got the chance to see the movie which won Isabelle Huppert Best Actress at Cannes, the movie which David Lame and his not so merry band of God Botherers tried to stop from being screened in NZ (without them having seen it). Lo, they have turned this movie into a decent sized hit as a result. THE PIANO TEACHER is actually the best SPCS publicized movie I've seen to date. Brilliantly directed by Michael Heneke, who scripted from Elfiede Jelinek's novel.Huppert plays Professor Erika Kohut; a cold, brutal, seemingly prudent piano teacher at a prestious music academy. But behind her icy facade lies an obsession with pornography and sadomasochistic sex. When a gifted young piano student (Benoit Magimel) comes under Erika's tutelage, he doesn't play to her impossibly high standards and as a result bears the brunt of her wrath but he soon finds himself falling in love with the professor who just seems to enjoy playing mind games with him. Though unknown to him Erika is gradually losing control under the influence of her domineering mother.<BR>THE PIANO TEACHER is exceptionally well photographed with a complex structure and a brilliant perfomance from Huppert (In fact you easily forget she IS just an actress playing a part).There are some rather grim scenes including plenty of S&M, a funny drive-in theatre peeing scene and Erika putting broken glass in a girls coat pocket. I'm not sure if this will get a DVD release in NZ, but it deserves to. THE PIANO TEACHER is a masterwork that commands a wide audience, and it was probably only because of its content that it was overlooked by the Academy. One of the best movies I've seen recently.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Alright...I'm a huge Incubus fan...and i have listened to every album dearly. I think that this album is my favorite....due to it's freeflowing and mellow nature. I love SCIENCE and Make Yourself, but this album displays the talent of Incubus more than those albums. I love the fact that the band changes with every album, and I can't wait until their next release, but that will be in 2004....so I'm going to be forced to wait. Finally, Incubus has retreated from metallic distortion and entered the realm of warm guitar tones and melodic songs. I love this album. All the songs are great, but my favorite are Aqueous Transmission, 11am, Are You In?, and Wish You Were Here.<BR>This album rocks!!!
0783233477|5.0|I did not see the movie when it came out since the name and explanation on the cover did not interest me. I rented it later on only because of anthony hopkins and brad pit. Was I pleasantly surprised. Excellent movie. Good acting, good plot and a nice ending. I highly recommend wathing this movie.
B00008I8IF|5.0|This could be my favorite Jayhawks album!  Every track is wonderful!!!
B000001Y5J|4.0|Nine Inch Nails is definetely one of the most over-rated artists today. He tries to be taken way too seriously I think. <BR>  However, my opinion of this album, well...<br />1. pinion-horrible intro.  One of the worst ever in history. But it at least doesn't take forever. 1/5<br />2. Wish-Best song on the album basically. Again, I think he tries to be too deep. 5/5<br />3. Last-Good song, second best on the album. 5/5<br />4. Help me I am in Hell-dark, very short, instrumental, but I'm telling you, this guy thinks he is so serious. 1/5<br />5. Happiness in Slavery - 4/5  Good song.<br />6. Gave Up - Can get corny sometimes. 4/5<br />Physical - Not deep at all, not dark at all. But it is actually a good song.  It's melodic. 5/5<br />Suck - Last song and it's probably the closest thing to darkness on this album. 5/5
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Be prepared to watch Memento several times.  There is much more going on than may meet the eye at first glance.  Director/Writer Nolan is doing much more than telling a tale in an innovative fashion.  He is making statements about reality and human experience whether he intended to or not.<br />The narrative loop in the film, far more than a gimmick, unseats us from the comfortable theater seat and makes us sit up an take notice.  By the end of the film, we have (hopefully!) figured out what exactly is going on to Leonard/Lenny.  It's a shame he has no clue -- or does he?<br />I've always thought Guy Pearce was a great actor, and this is easily his best work to date (with LA Confidential a close second).  Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are brilliant in the supporting cast.  I just wish this film had garnered more acclaim than it did.<br />Unfortunately I haven't found any of Nolan's work since to be all that memorable, but he has proven himself to be both insightful and capable of crafting a stunning piece of ground-breaking cinema.<br />One wish for the DVD -- on Nolan's &quot;Following&quot; we had the option of watching the film &quot;in order.&quot;  I really wanted that option here.  Not that I need it to help the film make sense, but just to get one step deeper into this wonderfully crafted film.  Now that I know the ending from the beginning, why not turn it on its head and see what we can see from another angle.
B000000993|5.0|There is nothing to complain about on this album.  It's very artistic and very active.  They usually sing about religious hypocrisy.  Tool has a very positive message and tells you to question authority and don't be a follower.
B000002UAR|5.0|One can debate which Beatles album is the best, but the importance of this album cannot be understated!  The musical changes on this album expanded and continued on from their previous album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; on through &quot;Sergeant Peppers&quot;, Magical Mystery Tour, and the White Album (lesser degree on Let It Be/Abbey Road).<br />The songs in this album expand beyond what was occurring and are all good to excellent...covering an array of styles. This was the first album I found Paul's Songs every bit as good John's both in the number of songs as the primary composer...but the quality (for me, the only time his overall song quality on an album matched John's). George's songs...though as a group I find a notch below J &amp; P's; are still quite good...most notably &quot;Taxman&quot;. <br />This album is vital for its key role (along with Rubber Soul and also Sergeant Pepper) for the impact it had on the Rock n Roll Culture as it evolved from 1965 into 1968. <br />I agree it does deserve to be in the top 10 all time albums; though I find Rubber Soul's overall song quality better. If they had only included John's instrumental &quot;Stephanie&quot; (best non-released Beatles song ever--on a par musically as Beach Boys title song &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;)...then I might change my mind. If your a Beatles fan and never heard &quot;Stephanie&quot;, you'll say, this was made in 1966?? Wow!<br />My favorite favorites...&quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, Here, There, and Everywhere&quot;, &quot;She Said, She Said&quot; &quot;For No One&quot;, Doctor Robert&quot; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;--precursor to A Day In A Life? <br />Unless your looking for just shallow &quot;pop&quot; songs, this is an album you will enjoy no matter how long you have it.
0385720920|4.0|It's a bizarre little world we live in when biblical fiction and sex addiction can get incorporated into the same dark book.  Palanhiuk definitely commands attention with his writing style and his use of repetition.  Anyone who liked 'Fight Club' will be enthralled by the quality writing, and appauled by the exaggerated preoccupation with sex this novel has to offer.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I've been reading and re-reading these books for years.  And when I heard they were shooting the entire trilogy I was very excited; I was also very concerned with the second one.  Mainly, my preoccupation was that the role of this book (in Tolkien's original conception of one book and not three) as the middle chapters would not make a very interesting movie; I thought it would be scattered and a little bit flat, not having a real conclusion or a beginning for that matter.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that it carries the story very well.<br />  Mr. Jackson and Company outdid themselves visually for this one, not to mention the stellar portrayal of Gollum by Andy Serkis in of the most interesting roles in cinematic history.  Forget the visual effects for this character, the movements and especially the voice work of Mr. Serkis take you on an unprecedented trip.  Mr. Jackson uses Gollum brilliantly to convey the cold and dark soul of book.  There is so much to mention about this movie, not in the least how the visual effects, cinematography and photography surpass the already masterful touch of the first movie.  To say that the battles scenes are simply impressive is an severe understatement.<br />  Now I´m looking forward, more than ever, to the Special Extended Edition DVD release in November.  And I can't wait to see the conclusion to the trilogy in December.  this is an excellent movie, even if you're not a Tolkien fan, but you like good cinema, you will find this a highly entertaining movie experience.<br />  Thanks again to Mr. Jackson and Company for this labour of love.  Blood, sweat and tears is only a small price to pay for the cinematic event of the turn of the millenium.  The fact that it does not come out of Hollywood is sweeter, perhaps even the reason why it is so great.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My 4 year old loves it!  Well done, always fun!
B000000W3G|5.0|If I could chose the two greatest albums of all time, this and modest mouse' &quot;lonesome crowded west&quot; would deffinetly be them. James Iha and Billy Corgan blow my mind with the solo's of &quot;I am One&quot; and &quot;Tristessa&quot; while Darcy Wertzky lays down the greatest bass line of all time on &quot;I am one&quot;. Even though Jimmy Chamberlain doesn't give his greatest performance, he is pivital to songs such as &quot;bury me&quot; and &quot;Tristessa&quot; again. For their first album alone, they should have been inducted into the hall of fame. Don't bother with any other album, just go straight to the shelves and grab 'Gish' from the Smashing Pumpkins, and you will love it as I love you.
B00005JLCE|3.0|April 2003 and still no sign of it! I can't believe they released \\"Body Of Evidence\\" on DVD before this Madonna flick. Yeah, I know, not the greatest comedy of all time; but had it been released around 1939 it would have been a huge hit! It's just good, ole slap-stick humor that most people can no longer understand because current tastes have become a bit more \\"sophisticated\\"........? Anyway, I hope we don't have to wait much longer for this......my VHS copy is long worn out.<br /><br />UPDATE: August 2005 and I ain't gettin' any younger here! And yes, they've done it again......released yet another stinker before WTG......\\"A Certain Sacrifice\\". How much longer must we wait?
0385504209|5.0|This book was fun to read. Even though people who read the kind of books mentioned by the characters in this novel already know all this stuff, it was great to see it used in a novel.
B00008I8IF|4.0|... I've been listening to the Jayhawks for about ten years now, and while this certainly isn't their best record (I'd give that honor to Tomorrow the Green Grass, although cases could be made for just about everything else they've released), it is nevertheless an strong, strong offering...and certainly better than almost everything you'll hear if your idea of music appreciation is turning on the radio and tuning into the Clear Channel megaliths of the world.<br />So many great tunes on this one...not to mention some nice guest appearances from Matthew Sweet and Jakob Dylan.  You'll be reminded of the Jayhawks earlier work (Blue Earth and Hollywood Town Hall), as well as luminaries like CSNY and Fleetwood Mac.  Other bands wouldn't be able to pull this off without sounding stale, recycled, or derivative.  The Jayhawks, however, manage to sound fresh, creative...even inspired.  Buy it.  And get your friends to buy it.
0676973760|5.0|It is incredible how any author can write 300 pages about a young man and a tiger adrift at sea, all the while keeping one's interest throughout. This book is destined to be taught in English literature classes for many years to come. Maybe also in philosophy and theology classes as well. Well worth the read for one and all. Goodbye Animal Farm - Hello Pi.
0784011680|5.0|From the director of great movie autobiographies such as Gandhi, and Cry Freedom, Chaplin hooks you right from the start. Simply, it's an interesting story. How a ragamuffin from the poor end of London became the most famous man in the world is wonderful.<br />Robert Downey Jr will always be able to look at this piece of work as his finest (forget Air America and all the news about addictions, this piece of film-work will keep him fondly remembered)<br />Footnote:<BR>When all movies were still silent flickering images, Chaplin made features dealing with controversial topics such as racism, and fascism, which lead the US authorities, particularly J Edgar Hoover, to brand Chaplin a communist, and have him kicked out of the USA. Chaplin deserved better, and had to wait until the 1970s before he was remembered and recognised by his peers in America.
B00005YU1O|1.0|If you're impressed by relentless name-dropping, superfiscial postulation, and overstimulating your eyes to the point of having a headache, then perhaps this movie is for you.  In which case, you should just stop reading right now and go out and buy this movie...  Heck!  Buy two or three copies just to get them off the shelf!<br />At best, this movie was like a droning college philosophy teacher, at worst like a romantic teenager.  From simply stating common sense to academic-esque name-dropping, _Waking Life_ only produces a sense of frustration at how pretensious a movie can really be.<BR>...And this isn't even getting into the animation.  At first, I'll admit, I too thought this was a really visually beautiful movie (at times it is), but after a while the animation began to grate at me as much as the \\"philosophy\\" ... With the ever-swirling, ever-morphing visuals, fifteen or twenty minutes left me feeling as if I was drunk and trying to listen to a bunch of amateurs (for the most part) blather on and on about...  dreams, I suppose...  Experience?...  I must say that I was almost wholey distracted from the monologues and dialogues by the overstimulation on the screen.  <BR>In the long run, I don't think that I gained a single positive thing from this movie (other than knowing yet another movie that I should not watch again and gaining the opportunity to inform others about it).<br />Richard Linklater's earlier movie \\"Slackers\\" to me was much the same, and yet much better in that it had a much lower level of pretension...  probably b/c he wasn't trying to impress us with his animating abilities and sense of aesthetic.<br />This is a movie for the unthinking masses.  I say philosophy should be more engaging than _Waking Life_ is capable of being.   Not once was I inspired into my own train of thought during this entire movie.  I felt as if I was being told a bunch of silly ideas about what dreams are and what reality and experience are, rather than being asked to think them out for myself.  In my experience, it is (more or less) the same fault in most traditional philosophy courses.<br />I'm telling you, there's a lot out there that does VERY WELL what _Waking Life_ only pretends to be able to do:<BR>If you are after philosophy, there are **what??** 2400 years of great philosophical readings from Plato to the _Bible_ to Darwin to Nietzsche to Freud  to Irigaray...<BR>If you're into great animation, try checking out anything by Hayao Miyazaki...<BR>If it's dreams you're into, then there's _Akira Kurosawa's Dreams_, or _The Book of Dreams_ by Jack Kerouac...<BR>Or if it's visual stimulation you're after, take a walk through any art museum, or watch any movie by Kurosawa, Bergman or Fellini...<br />The moral of the story?  If I was surrounded by a bunch of friends that were as obsessed with this movie as many people are...  Then I would reconsider who I want to be my friends!
B000000WCV|4.0|I gotta say that I was very surprised when I read the reviews already existing because I didn't find them very helpful at all.To me, homework is certainly one of the best house music cds ever, and by far. For people that like hard house, rollin'&amp; scratchin' is for you, it is just perfect! I don't know how people can like this cd but don't like this track, it s just awesome. It is a very eclectic cd, which takes you from the crowded beginning of the night with &quot;around the world&quot;, and brings you to other places with &quot;Rollin' &amp; Scratchin'&quot; passing by &quot;Burnin'&quot;. All those tracks will make you dance all by yourself in your room, and will make you have the time of your life! Don't miss it, definitely a master piece..
B00008H2LB|5.0|After reading all the negitive reviews to this CD I just had to pitch in my 2 cents. I've loved Linkin Park since the Day I got Hybrid Theory. I've never heard a CD to match it including this one. However I've heard very few that match this CD either. Linkin Park has done well with the task of following up the best CD of all time with a very good sophomore CD. <br />The thing Linkin Park does well is make CDs that can be listened to over and over. Most other CDs I buy get listened to for a week or two and then barely listened to ever again. LPs songs are built to last time. Very well put together. <br />At first listen you may find yourself disapointed with this CD but do yourself a favor and give it a chance. I love it!<br />Hope I could help someone in my jumble of thoughts.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Even the best review isn't good enough for this album. This opus of music is beyond that of a review. It is an experiance every individual must embrace for themselves. It's just good music. Simple and complex. Innocent and angry. Beautiful and raw. I think the Elephant is symbolic to the theme of this album. Yup, the Elephant pretty much sums up my feelings about this album. Think of the majesty and power and rage an elephant can possess while simultaneously encopmassing great elements of grace and innocenece and temperence. This album takes many opposite ends of the spectrum and blends them together creating the perfect balence of music that will be marvelled over even by our children.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|After hearing Straight Out of Line on the radio, I was hoping the whole new album would be as brutal and I wasn't disappointed. My favorite's are Straight Out of Line, I Stand Alone, Faceless, Dead and Broken, and I Am. All the songs are great, but I think these are a notch above the others. Buy this album if you like heavy riffs and awesome drumming. BTW Shannon Larkin used to live in my hometown back in his Wrathchild days.
B00005YW4H|5.0|In a world of raw and ugly words, music(and I use the term loosly) so bad, it is downright disheartening, comes a rose, sweet and tender and in full bloom, her name is Norah Jones.  Such loveliness and very deserving of 5 Grammy's.  Thank you Norah Jones for the encouragement that there are really music makers out there who wish to make beautiful music again.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|Godsmack has never really been that great. Just a really heavy sounding band. This album doesnt disappoint if you want heavy. ALthough, if your looking for complicated songs and great vocals this isnt the best choice. The lyrics arent really that deep. At least he doesnt talk about being alone as much that got pretty old. IF you want heavy get the album but thats all it is.
B000002UV9|5.0|Easily one of the top - and most well known releases by a staple band in the progressive rock world.  Many of these songs hint of something larger... almost as if they were each lifted from a movie soundtrack.  (If you want a COMPLETE epic, check out &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot;!)<br />All throughout, the band exhibits their trademark &quot;tightness&quot;, both instrumentally and vocally.  The guitar work is flawless and very engaging and the truly singable melodies will haunt you even after you press the stop button.  The arrangements remind you that this is NOT your standard rock band - but they are never TOO progressive as to frighten off people who are new to the more advanced styles of music.  If you are looking at possibly exploring &quot;deeper&quot; music, this is a good start.
B000084T18|4.0|I think this CD is hot, but you can't compare this CD to 2pac &quot;All eyes on me&quot; or Nas &quot;Illmatic&quot;. 50 cent is a bad rapper, but you can't say he is as great as 2pac or biggie. 50 cent is not that great yet. he needs to work on his flows a little bit more, but he is still a great rapper and you shouldn't be dissing on him for what he has accomplished, but then again you can't say he is better then 2pac or biggie, so since this CD is hot but not as great as everyone said, I gave it 4 stars
B00008J2DQ|5.0|To keep it short, this album is simply brilliant.  The album retains the masterful, driving energy of its predecessors while at the same time revealing, growing lyrical depth and maturity in their song writing.  New drummer Shannon Larkin brings new energy and excellent drumming skills to the table.  While Godsmack's drummers have never been less than great, Shannon seems to be the best so far.  Personally I'd like to see Sully take the drums, but Shannon is great.  <BR>Immediately one will notice that the songs seem more upbeat.  From the getgo, the album opens with gunfire reminiscent of Metallica's One.  The drum salvo comes in with force, a common theme in the album, the drums are right there powering the songs.  Godsmack, gone soft?  Heck no!  There as heavy as ever, except this time around they've got a middle eastern track on there, serenity that has some sweet string work by underrated guitarist Tony Rombola.  Speaking of which, hes back, better than ever...he even abandons his wah pedal a couple of times on the album, like on one of the strongest offerings of the album, \\"Realign\\", in which he delivers a superb solo worthy of praise.  <BR>The songs are all masterfully crafted, drawing on Godsmacks strengths; its strong powerful lyrics and mesa-boogie amps and Gibson Les Paul guitars.  Many of the songs hit you like a train with there drop C powered riffs.  Every solo on the album is great, it is evident that Tony Rombola spent much more time on these solos, (a tribute to there long lockdown in a house isolated from outside musical influences in which they wrote this album.)  Every song feels fresh and the album flows quite well.  The riffs are more complex than before and the vocal melodies are better than ever, with Sully testing his range on such tracks as \\"Changes\\", \\"Make Me Believe\\", and \\"Realign\\" among others.  Its admirable to see him moving to new levels with his trademark voice.  He has also moved away from his typical bitter, even hateful lyrics, offering more inciteful reflective lyrics this time around although he clearly doesn't abandon his roots as is shown in the track, \\"I *** hate you.\\"<BR>Although the album is a bit short for my tastes, clocking in at just over 47 minutes, every minute is great.  Much more care has been taken in song construction and the songs now have some lead and more diverse structures even some clean portions!  The casual metal fan will enjoy this album greatly and the Godsmack fan will love it, in my opinion it is there strongest album to date.<BR>1. Straight out of line - Great song, nice solo, solid riff, excellent drumming<BR>2. Faceless - Wah driven song, (think Whatever), great solo, very powerful<BR>3. Changes - Catchy nice chorus, great solo, good lyrics, solid riffing, excellent drumming<BR>4. Make Me Believe - Sully testing his range here, GREAT riff all around (look for the guitar part before chorus...heck yeah!), nice little solo as always, Good Bridge (More Sully experimentation, meaningful, almost sad lyrics<BR>5. I Stand Alone - Great solid song, nice chorus, great verse riff, superb drums (credit to Tommy Stewart there), pure Godsmack here<BR>6. Re-Align - perhaps the strongest offering here, a little reminiscent of awake on chorus riff, solid vocal melody, KILLER wah-less SOLO!<BR>7. I *** Hate you - Powerful Grinding riff that sucks you in, good lyrics for a hate song, typical godsmack song, but more energy and GREAT RIFF<BR>8. Releasing the Demons - very cool verses, nice guitar work, cool little syncopated bridge grind, classic \\"awake\\" like, but different at the same time.<BR>9. Dead and Broken - Great lyrically a little reminiscent of the style of \\"mistakes\\" in intro, nice verse riff, some cool tremolo pick classic Godsmack lead<BR>10. I Am - a little reminiscent in into of \\"trippin\\", GREAT LYRICS, \\"Death will come when I'm good and ready!\\", nice bridge classic ozzy/creed/metallica like bridge, nice background lead<BR>11. The Awakening - Think \\"The Journey\\" from awake, a congo drum solo intro thing to next track very cool, Shannons got skills baby<BR>12. Serenity - The \\"bands answer to voodoo\\", sweet acoustic stuff and other strings, great, reflective lyrics, and a cool middle eastern feel, songs like this show Godsmacks great talents and diverse influenses, effectively closes album, great track<br />This album is pure \\"energy rock\\", as Sully stated.  It takes all of Godsmacks strengths, adds more mature and reflective lyrics, some freaking awesome solos, better riffs, and an amazing drummer to the mix with great success.  This is one of the best albums in my collection which is wide and diverse if I do say so myself.  Buy this album, even if you don't get it for $9 during the first week it is out, it is worth every penny of whatever its price.  Buy it now and treat yourself to great music from one of the greatest bands of modern times.

B000089RVX|5.0|I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of hearing multi-million dollar artists complaining about how many times their dad beat them as a child, or when their mom got stoned in front of them and it ruined their life.  Rock has turned into a walking contradiction that had made me almost give up completely.  Then I saw the Daredevil movie(Two reviews in one).  The only thing that kept the movie alive were the songs &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  I did a little research and found out about Evanescence and decided to buy the disc expecting another mediocre performance, held together by a few good singles.  By the time I had listened to the CD in its entirety, I was in tears.  This is the best offering for mainstream rock in years.  The skin-crawlingly beautiful vocals of Amy Lee overlayed with the sometimes standard, but still heavy and interesting metal rythyms provided by Ben Moody lead to the greatest rock album of the past decade.  No matter your opinion of new metal, this CD needs to be in your collection, even if only to look at and be amazed at how good it is.
B00000255F|5.0|What? I can only bring one album with me to a desert island?  Thats an easy choice - its 'Born to Run'.
B0000073NC|5.0|This is the Scorps 2nd album, for years this was part of USA RCA's budget albums, but oddly, has been outof print for some time now in the USA. <br />Fly to the Rainbow plays a pivotal role in the Scorps career. As Lonesome crow was more Psych-Blues, Fly to the Rainbow is more Psych-Hard Rock. <br />They also revamped the lineup for this one, Michael Schenker is gone, as we all know, he left to join UFO. Uli Roth is the NEW lead guitarist, who obviously brings a lot to the table. This is also Francis Bucholtz's 1st albumwith the Scorps, a big time under-rated bass player who plays off the wild lead guitar playing quite nicely. Listen to &quot;This is My Song&quot;, for some nice melodic bass playing. The drums are handled by Jurgen Rosenthal, one of the better drummers in a long line of Scorps percussionists. <br />Speedy's Coming: This type of tune is what would become a typical Scorps Hard Rockin song. But this is the prototype, the 1st one. Funny how this song seems out of place on this album. Lotsof cool references to Alice Cooper, Ringo Starr, Royal Albert Hall. Very cool lyriclly, with all the stuff about the girl hanging posters on her wall and getting hot and bothered by the rock star coming to town. <br />They Need a Million: This is the 1st in the Rainbow concept, which seems to have something to do with the poor and oppresed finding a better life, probably an East/West German thing. Starts with a nice Acoustic piece played by Rudy, then goes into the Flamenco thing. Th lead vocalshere are hadled by Rudy Schenker, NOT Uli Roth, as many may think, mainly because rudy never sings again after this album. Strng backrounds by Klaus. <br />Drifting Sun: Uli's time to shine. Blistering lead guitar, and pounding, heavy bcking track make this one a winner. Uli's Vocals on this one are probably the best he's ever recorded on record, his voice is a little higher and seems to be in the right key for his limited vocal range. The spoken word section is again sung by Rudy Schenker, which luckily was done through a leslie speaker cabinet, as Rudy has a heavy accent and unusual speaking voice. To cap this all off is a stinging Moog synthesizer line that is just perfect. Pchyedelic mind trip, close your eyes and off we go!<br />Fly People Fly: Back to the Rainbow concept for this one. A song only the Scorps can write, moody and bluesy, with top notch vocals from Klaus who also doubles on harmony. Once again, stuning lead guitar from Uli. Listen and you'll hear Francis Busholtz almost make a bass playing error. <br />This is My Song: Nice straight ahead rocker, very melodic but a litte repetitive on the Chorus. Still, catchy and listenable, and nice bass work from Fran. <br />Far Away: Broken up into 2 parts, the 1st being a soft mellotron piece at the string setting, the secondbeing a scorchinging heavy ballad. Another Rainbow piece. Very tastful and an extremly catchy hook to take you back to the verses. I cannot beleive how this guy plays lead guitar on this. It is the best lead playing I have ever heard. Period. <br />Fly to the Rainbow: Well here we are, at the end of the record. The acoustic intro is a nice, upbeat piece that says there is a happy ending to this story. Then we're off into this harmony lead guitar section where all 3 guitarists are playng lead. Then were off into pchedelic land again with heavy flanging and poetic reads by Uli. A nice and fitting way to end the record. <BR>Take note that Michael Schenker pinched part of the acostic intro and used it on &quot;Crystal Light&quot;, on UFO's 1974 release Phenomenon. <br />Well there you have it, a classic rock album by a great rock band. What makes this different for a Scorpions standpoint is that this was a hge step up from Lonesome Crow, which had some great guitar work, but seems terribly outdated, even from its release date it sounds 5 years too old. <br />Fly to the Rainbow has Moog Synth on 2 songs, wild dive bomber guitar solos, cool sound effects, mellotrons,bizzare vocals, concepts, great muscanship. The keyboards went uncredited, as well as the alternate vocalists. This was produced by the Scorps, who did a great job. <br />I'd love to hear from others who love this album, its one of  my favorites as well.
0802130208|1.0|As some have reviewed, I was one of those captivated by the prologue.  The story of how the book was published is far better than the story itself.  I too, found it difficult to pick up this book once it was put down.  A mish-mash of vignettes, dream states, and letters by the 'hero' created a mood of boredom and disappointment.  The boredom came from this book just not being funny.  The disappointment mainly at how much time I was wasting in continuing to read it.  I believe in finishing what I started and was determined to the end to give this a chance.  The joke was on me.  I was the true dunce.  In reflection, maybe that's the irony here?
0066214122|5.0|What I find to be extremely interesting science is presented in Michael Crichton's \\"PREY\\". Biological science coupled with computer software science and nanotechnology are engaged in a project  that involves evolution and adaption, among other things.<br />\\"PREY\\" is really an exciting and frightening novel, partly because the events in the story could probably really happen. An unemployed computer programmer/manager, has become a job searching stay-at-home dad. He is eventually asked by his former employer, who had fired him, to return and help with a computer program.  For obvious reasons he is reluctant to do this.<br />In this book, evolution takes on a new meaning. <br />If we only learn one thing from \\"PREY\\" it would be responsibility. \\"...jerry-built, half-baked, concocted in a hurry to solve present problems and never a thought to the future.\\" (p.362 of \\"PREY\\") Sound familiar?<br />After you read the book, go back and reread the Introduction.
B000000WJZ|4.0|Quite simply, this is the 'pumpkins and Billy Corgan's finest album. While Mellon Collie established SP as rock gods, it was 1993's Siamese Dream that was the inspiration. &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; is a solid rock opener, followed by the darker &quot;quiet&quot; and then by the delightful &quot;today&quot;.<BR>The album really hits full pitch with the beautiful, but controversial ballad &quot;Disarm&quot; and epic piece &quot;Soma&quot;.<BR>&quot;Mayonaise&quot; and &quot;Spaceboy&quot; keep the feeling of the album until the very end - possibly the greatest love song ever, with &quot;Luna&quot;<br />Straight up this is an album that showcased rock when rock was good.<br />&quot;I go along, Just because i'm lazy, I go along to be with you&quot; - Luna
B000003BF4|5.0|The one thing that comes across the Stones in all their 70's music is their attitude.  Though, not a 70's CD but more like the Welcoming is Get Your YA-YA's out.  Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, are there to make the guitars thrive in funk and hard in melo dramatic collaborations.  Entertaining rock.  There is a reason the team of Jagger and Richards have been around for 40 years...Attitude.  It's full of teen age rebellion,  the teen age swagger, the teen age party, the teen age wreckless ambition.  Though at the time they were heading into their 30's. Compared to their Souled Out concerts of the mid 80's and beyond the mentors of rock could learn a few rules they must have forgot by listening to this CD.  Yes it's a bit ragged but that was the flambouyancy of the late 60's early 70's rock where it wasn't meant to be commercialized.  It was meant to drive parents insane.  I am 40 have 7 kids and now I use it to drive the kids insane.  If you like gut wrenching fist clinching.  It's the fountain of youth recorded.  Buy it you'll like it.
B000000WA4|4.0|A journey like no other, no wonder mellon collie sold millions world wide to become the most successful SP album ever. Although '93's Siamese was a slightly better piece, Mellon Collie can lay claim to being a groundbreaking earth shattering experimentation that really did turn rock on it's head when it was getting oh so predictable.<BR>You'd think 28 tracks over a mamoth 2 hours would be too much for a band yet to break the richter scale in terms of musical acclaim, but Mellon pulls it off.<BR>Sure you've all probably heard their commercial releases like \\"Tonight, Tonight\\", \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" and \\"1979\\" and thought they were pretty good songs, but it's the songs within the songs that give this album its \\"gift\\".<BR>Split over two \\"plays\\" if you will, Dawn to Dusk (side a)and Twilight to Starlight, both sides feature unheard of melodies, riffs and soul searching. Billy Corgan is one of the greatest lyrist of all time, just check out \\"an ode to no one\\" , \\"in the arms of the sleep\\" and \\"thru the eyes of ruby\\" as proof.<BR>Starting with a rare rock/classical piece, dawn to dusk is much heavier and harder than twilight. But it is just a precursor to what follows on disc 2.<BR>Quite possibly the greatest song SP have ever written lies in the very last track of this amazing adventure, \\"farewell and goodnight\\".<br />One of the greats - an experience that will stay with you a long, long time.<br />\\"Your strength is my weakness, your weakness my hate\\" Thru the eyes of ruby

0767817664|5.0|All-time entertainment thriller. Now a classic. A vampire movie in the comic vein. Wonderfully written story and screenplay. Great cinematography in great detail. A lot of work went into making this film. Perfectly cast. William Ragsdale is perfect in the lead. William Ragsdale has been married since 1999 and still has an active career.<br /> Amanda Bearse plays \\"Amy\\" who is also the perfect female lead. As you know Miss Bearse went on to co-star in the Fox tv series \\"Married With Children\\" (1986-1997). Bearse announced in 1993 on a \\"Comedy Central\\" special that she was lesbian. She currently has an daughter.<br /> Stephen Geoffreys adds his own style to this film and plays an important part as well. He plays \\"Evil\\". Incidentally, Mr. Geoffreys did another horror film,[[ASIN:B0000694WL 976-Evil]](1989) and had the lead role. Stephen Geoffreys tried to get mainstream roles in Hollywood, but went on to do non-hardcore sex films with male nudity in play and then adult gay porn under a different name. He is now trying to get back into mainstream films again and appeared in [[ASIN:B002A00IXW Sick Girl (Special Edition DVD)]] (2007), New Terminal Hotel (2009), Emerging Past (2010), The Diary of Randy Rose (2010) and [[ASIN:B005JZBPFU Bite Marks]] (2011).<br />  Stephen Geoffreys and Amanda Bearse also appeared in [[ASIN:B00005RYL4 Fraternity Vacation]] (1985).<br /> Chris Sarandon is so evil in this film as \\"Jerry Dandrige\\"-- The Vampire that I could not watch him in another film. Good acting.<br /> Last but not least is Roddy McDowall, as brilliant an actor as he was, he played \\"Peter Vincinct\\", a man who is a tv host for broadcast horror movies and \\"Charlie\\" (William Ragsdale) hires him to rid of the vampire living next door to him.<br />Roddy McDowall was a well-liked professional actor who began his acting as a child. You may have seen him in [[ASIN:B00006RCO3 How Green Was My Valley]](1941). He had many female friends, including Maureen O'Hara and Elizabeth Taylor, and had male friends, however he never officially came out as being \\"gay\\". He was. It was hinted a little bit in tv-movie, Mae West (1982). He died October 3, 1998 of lung cancer. He never had an enemy.<br /> I'm glad Roddy McDowall agreed to do this film and the sequel. This film is made with class, style and great well-made special effects. Great soundtrack too. On the DVD, I am sorry to say there is no audio commentary, no special features or bonuses, no cast reunion. You do get the choice of Widescreen or Full Screen on either side of the disc. I recommend Full-Screen. The beginning of the film will be in Widescreen because of the titles and credits but will become Full-Screen, if you chose the Full-Screen side.<br />  Stephen Geoffreys delivers the catchy phrase: \\"You are so cool, Brewster\\" and he repeated it in [[ASIN:B005JZBPFU Bite Marks]] (2011).<br /> I have read somewhere that their were alternative endings of this film. If so, this DVD does not show them here.<br /> Followed by [[ASIN:B00009YXHJ Fright Night Part II]] (1989), with William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall.<br /><br />Remakes: [[ASIN:B003Y5H5FG Fright Night]] (2011).

0380820846|5.0|Okay, Okay...I put off buying this book.  Having recently gotten married, I simply didn't have the time to read.  Finally, after being told by my romance reading friend how wonderful the book was, I thought I would MAKE time to read it.  Boy was it sure worth it!  I loved this book!  Although, I loved all of the books in this series.  Having read so many romance novels sometimes I come across one that I wonder if these people really do love one another. Well let me tell you that you KNOW that the characters in this book really do.  Penelope and Colin were such a joy to read about.  I simply had to read it all in one setting, and when I was finished I was sad it was over.  I am anxiously awaiting her next one, and believe me, I WILL get it immediately.  If you do purchase this book, (I hope you do, you will love it)  Make sure you start at the beginning of the series and work your way to this one.  All of them are wonderful.  Happy reading.
B00008I8IF|4.0|Producer Ethan Johns (of Ryan Adams fame) described the Jayhawks song structures as American roots music with British melodies. I think he hit it on the head. The influences heard on 'Rainy Day Music' range from Gram Parsons to the Kinks, CSN&Y to the Beatles, the Beach Boys to Faces . But in the end the sound is undeniably unique. Even though influence is evident, there is nothing recycled or banal about this music. It is pure, stripped down goodness. Gary Louris and gang have left behind the glossy, out of place production of 'Smile' and the psychedelic experimentation that floated through 'Sound of Lies' allowing the new songs to speak for themselves.  In this bare form the tunes seem deceptively simple, yet with repeat listens the intricacy of Louris' writing reveals itself proving that this album will only age better with time. By cutting away the excess 'Rainy Day Music' offers up sparse, honey soaked ditties dealing with love, loss, and being lost. The great achievment here is that they make loneliness and longing so damn beautiful. The harmonies that have become associated with the Jayhawks' sound are here but more subtle. Songs such as All the Right Reasons, Save it for a Rainy Day and Angelyne are among the best this band has ever produced. Drummer Tim O'Reagan's gem Tampa to Tulsa is more aching and intimate on the demo version as is Louris' gorgeous ballad All the Right Reasons. And what better way to end this collection than with Gary playing Waiting for the Sun all by his lonesome.<br />There will be those who still say the Jayhawks aren't the same without Mark Olson. Well, yes, this is a different incarnation of the Jayhawks. One, in my opinion, just as glorious as when Olson was co-fronting the band. Gary Louris has had the bravery to march forward into new territory, to constantly challenge himself and his bandmates by respecting the past but never trying to relive it.  With 'Rainy Day Music' the Jayhawks continue to evolve. I can't wait to see what's next.'s next.
0783239955|5.0|The first time I watched this movie was on a VHS video tape. My wife and me had to stop the movie at least ten times to catch a breath between laughing fits. We did restrain ourselves from throwing the ashtray at the bumbling Ms. Pignon (Jacques Villeret) but I did throw my slippers.<br />Since then I've watched this film about 10 times, and still can only restrain myself with an effort. Thierry Lhermitte as the snob is fantastic. Alexandra Vandernoot, his wife does a great job, and Catherine Frot the girlfriend is really cool in her role.<br />Daniel Prevost, the tax collector who &quot;would audit his own mother&quot; but is crazy about football (soccer), and Francis Huster (the once slighted friend) who comes back to help play their roles admirably.<br />If you like slapstick, you won't find it here, but if you like your comedy fresh, and intelligent, by all means get this, get some friends, and sit down for a treat, but REMOVE ALL HEAVY OBJECTS FROM THE ROOM
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I loved the action in this moivie. No one could make a better Tomb Raider than Angelina Jolie. I mean there was action and some funny parts in this movie. I can't wait for Tomb Raider and the Cradle of Life to come out.
1559408855|4.0|Passolini won a golden palm at Cannes with this movie. He must have handed out joints to the jury.<br />This movie is disgusting, gross, obscene, violent, abhorrent. I am about to run out of epithets to describe it. The scat dinner scene actually made me nauseous, and I have a very very strong stomach.<br />Yet I am giving it 4 stars.<br />After the nausea is over, the movie is actually a pretty good adaptation of the book 120 days of Sodom, transferred to the ephimerous Republic of Salo, after the first fall of Mussolini. In that context, a scenario like this movie depicts could be imagined.<br />In that context, the powerful men, who know they are doomed, could conceivably meet for a dark, sadistic, orgiastic last bang.<br />For creativity, impact, and the actual production of the movie, as well as for the sheer chutzpah of filming it, is why I give it the 4 stars.<br />However, still my recomendation is \\"Do not buy this movie\\" It has artistic value, yes. It has literary value, yes. It probably should not be seen by anyone under 30 (or even 40)<br />Just walk away
B00005JL3A|5.0|This is not a zombie movie but a warning about bio weaponry mistakes, but it was still good. I maen the way that they kept the stillness from the game in it.

0064409422|5.0|\\"The Lion the Withch and the Wardrobe\\" by C.S. Lewis is a very interesting book. I would say this book would be most enjoyed by a reader that has the ability to exspand the imagination.  This is a wonderful book that really boggles the imagination of the reader.  The different charaters are a real important part in this story because of the far out possibilities of who or what they really are. All the diversity is wonderful.  This book is for readers of all different ages that like to use their imagination, or basicaly just suspend reality for a while. As you read this book you can laugh, cry, and even catch yourself being amazed through it all. I can say that i think this book is awesome. i have told alot of people to read it. I have even started reading the entire series of this book. so take our advice and read it to find out for yourself.
0679745203|5.0|I have been meaning to write a review for The English Patient, a semi-sequel to In the Skin of a Lion.  I've been reluctant to do so because these two are very much alike with regards to style and characters.  The two characters from In the Skin of a Lion, Hana and Carravagio, are also found in The English Patient.  As always, it's always hard to accept that a sequel of a novel you love so much is as good as, and possibly better, than the original novel.  My mistake here is to think of these two novels as interconnected for The English Patient stands beautifully on its own.  <br />Here we have traumatised characters emerging from the war. Hana is a young nurse who has chosen to stay behind in an abandoned Italian villa to care for a nameless and burnt English patient.  She has chosen to retreat from the world to serve an almost sanctified patient in order to forget her past - the loss of an unborn child, a lover, and her beloved father (Patrick).  The patient Almasy's story begins prewar in a fractured narrative.  His story involves a tragic love affair with the desert and a woman (Katherine).  Then there is Caravaggio - the thief, a spy, an old friend of Hana's father, who has lost his nerve due to the brutality of the war, who finds refuge in Hana's dilapidated villa.  The novel however, is more about theme and character than plot.  <br />Ondaatje has mined these characters beautifully.  He has managed to reveal to us that a life is like a landscape - it can be mapped, explored, and very much loved, but it can remain as much a mystery as when you first discovered it. The curvature and beauty of the desert becomes a symbol for a woman's body and the painting of a Queen becomes meditative relief for a traumatised Sikh during the war.  In this manner, Ondaatje reveals to us the complexity and richness of a life.  <br />It is also a treaty on grief, loss, nationhood and isolation.  All the main characters that populate this novel are outsiders in search of some senseof belonging - Hana is stricken by tragedies and displaced from her homeland Canada; the patient found solitude in the desert; Katherine, a young wife who finds herself among foreigners and men; Kip is a Sikh; Caravaggio - our thief.  Their discovery of each other and the change in their inner lives parallels the realignment and disappearance of national borders.  To each other, they surrender a little bit of their territory by sharing a journey of recovery, and their individual stories.   <br />I will not deny that this novel can be difficult to read and I am not surprise that many people have found the prose too difficult to grasp.  That is reasonable because the cross-cutting of Ondaatje's narrative, his particular style, and the themes he explores do not make for an easy or even entertaining novel.  <br />This novel however, is undeniably one of the best - if not the best - I have ever read.  Ondaatje possesses the kind of mind that feeds on poetry, that finds the profound in the ordinary.  His ability to explore themes through the subtle use of symbols, allegorical examples, and language places him in a league all of his own.  For me, his novels are landscapes and a way of seeing the world that you wish to carry with you always.  I hope that the reader who picks up The English Patient will cherish and love this novel as much as I do.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India.Arie just feels so real.  Her magnetic appeal is not forced or contrived like many of the synthesized Studio Wonders that blanket the Billboard today.  Raw talent, smooth vocals, head-nodding acoustic guitar riffs, meaningful messages...ingredients of an out-of-the-box masterpiece. She speaks in Layman's terms on how to love yourself, being positive and natural without taking on the aura of Earth Goddess.  <br />I have a teenage sister who is loves to sing and is pursuing a career in being a musical artist.  After hearing 'Video', 'Brown Skin', and 'Strength', I wanted to give her an R&amp;B influence that was not crass or obscene.  Something outside of her Gospel background.  Without the work of India.Arie and a few others in this industry, I would be hard pressed to find a cd that I would be comfortable with giving her.
0064400557|5.0|This book is very cool. When I read it, I was crying when I heard that Charlotte died. It is very sad. It is a great educational book that you can read and learn some stuff about friendship and loving and being kind.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|Well what to say about this new Godsmack CD.  Its pretty much in the same vein as Awake.  So if you were a big fan of Awake you'll probably dig Faceless.  I was more into the first album.  The songs all sounded different and they each had a personality.  Didn't really like the sound and songs from Awake, but they were expanding their sound which always is a plus don't want to get stuck in a rut.<br />Faceless seems like they didn't really have that growth between albums.  It sounds pretty much like Awake.  It almost has the exact same pattern to the track listing.  The Awakening is Facless's version of Spiral Intro ya know which is cool.  The last two songs (Awakening and Serenity) are pretty much the experimental ones.  Can't diss a band that wants to try something new I'm all for that.<br />I just can't really get into Faceless.  Close to 3/4 of the songs start out with the same &quot;boom&quot; thing like Awake and Forgive Me.  Dead and Broken and I Stand Alone have similar guitar riff intros which try to spice things up a bit.<br />They have a groove going on and you know that it is Godsmack.  Its just not for me right now.  I felt the same way about other bands.  Disturbed and Linkin Park for example.  I liked their first records, but the sophomore relases ... not so much.  They all start to sound the same after a while.<br />I really had high hopes for Godsmack on this one.  Awake was a dissapointment to me.  And now so is Faceless.  I think if they took a step back and didn't write all their songs with the same formula, but kept the aggressiveness and their attitude they could make one hell of a record and hopefully turn some heads.  Until then I'll just have to pass on the Godsmack for now.  Good effort just not great ... we'll see what happens in the future.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|It lacks in originality, but what do you want? It is nearly impossible for ANY band to make up bona fide new material in ths day and age.<br />It does kick A$$ though. Heavy riffs, growling and screaming lyrics, and the creation of a powerful atmosphere by this album. I found it best to listen through the entire album, not skipping a song. <br />If you just want to take the stress out on something, do it listening to this.

0345448898|5.0|I am reading something now that is a lot of fun, and great writing:  the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Philip Pullman.  It's a series of young-adult novels with multiple worlds and realities and an eventual battle against God or \\"The Authority\\", lived mostly through the eyes of two kids, Lyra and Will.  Everyone in Lyra's universe has a daemon, which is kind of like a physical manifestation of your soul, usually in animal form.  In some ways it is like the shamanic power animal that's always with you, or a witch's familiar, but even more \\"you\\" than any of those things.  The author's imagination is rich and his storytelling superb.  Highly recommended!
B00007KQA3|2.0|1984 film 1984 has long been in need of remastering and re-release, but sadly MGM only did it half right. For one, the compositions are too tightly letterboxed wacking some nice visual info off the top of some shots. The biggie is that they chose to dump all of the Eurythmics contributions to the music score in favor of Dominic Muldowney's compositions. Both scores are nice, but the film has lost a great deal of the distinction that the Eurythmics tracks lent to it. Muldowney's score is servicable, and was well utilized in the patriotic anthems of Oceania, but the Eurythmics portions lent a haunting beauty to many scenes, and are woefuly missed. MGM could have released both scores on alternate tracks, but they cheaped out. Too bad.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I just bought this CD yesterday, and I haven't stopped listening to it. the hooks are much better than Awake, and the guitar solo's are the best Godsmack guitarist Tony Rombola has come up with. below is a chart of the quality of songs on the album.<br />\\"Straight out of Line\\": 10/10     this is their first single from faceless, and definately a good one to pick. David Bottril's (the producer of Tool) mark has been made on this song.<br />\\"Faceless\\": 9/10      Title track, not a bad song, although it takes some getting used to. chorus sounds like \\"I stand alone\\", other than that, good song.<br />\\"Changes\\": 9/10      awesome opening riff. a very slow song, with dark, heavy verses. fans will be pleased.<br />\\"Make Me Believe\\": 8/10     another slow song. progressive verses, and a screaming chorus makes this song a good follow-up to changes.<br />\\"I Stand Alone\\": 9/10    Song from \\"the Scorpion King\\". Great opening riff. other than radio overplayed this song WAY too much, great song.<br />\\"Re-align\\": 10/10     My favorite song. sounds like a blend of their two first albums, with a great chorus that sticks with you.<br />\\"I F**king Hate you\\": 10/10     The heaviest song on the album. also one of the best. ... <br />\\"Releasing the Demons\\": 8/10    another song that is slow and melodic. good solo.<br />\\"Dead and Broken\\": 9/10     Good from start to finish, although it gets pretty repetative towards the end. awesome opening riff.<br />\\"I am\\": 9/10    Good follow up to dead and broken. very slow, but goes with the lyrics. good ending.<br />\\"The Awakening\\": 7/10    about a minute of tribal drums and chanting. other than it dosent go with the rest of the cd AT ALL, its pretty cool.<br />\\"Serenity\\": 9/10     The soft effort that would be the equal of Voodoo. its very slow and calm, but the lyrics are very harsh. good end to the cd, but not great.<br />All in all, this is definately worth owning. definately goes with playing halo on xbox.
B0000062Y2|4.0|When I first saw this musical back in junior high, i hated it because, going to a Catholic school, it went against some of what I was taught, but I never forgot the music. I just recently saw the traveling production with the original Judas (Carl Anderson as Judas) and Sebastian Bach as Jesus. I first want to say that it was interesting to see a rock star play the son of God and to see the original Judas, but one thing that got on my nerves was Bach was constantly wailing; like he was trying to sing in a rock show. This soundtrack with the original Jesus is a lot better.
0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart reads so simply. The sentences are so concise and direct, attacking the reader. This novel doesn't seduce you the reader; instead, it forces you to put aside all of your prejudices inherited from your own culture, and the novel compels you to enter Okonkwo's own violent, beautiful culture. Then, once you are in, Achebe pummels you, making you feel a sense of destruction similar to that of a culture being destroyed by colonialism.<br />The novel is simple, and at the same time, it's not. Things Fall Apart is much more than just an indictment of Western Culture. It explores complex questions about the clash of cultures. It explores the meaning of truth, and everything relates to Western culture itself as it is sucked into W.B. Yeats's gyre along with the Igbo. Things Fall Apart is one of the powerful stories of the Twentieth Century, and it is a novel which will stand far past the Postmodern era.
0451092163|5.0|At first, this book was kinda boring. Once, you get into it, you can't put it down! This is definately Stephen King's scariest book. I was kind of disappointed with the ending. I recommend this to everyone!
B000063DFQ|5.0|iron maiden's piece of mind is a peace of art.  Not a bad song on this album.  \\"Revelations\\" is excellent, so is \\"where eagles dare\\",\\"die with your boots on\\", and  \\"still life\\".  If your'e a fan of the book Dune then you should listen to \\" to tame a land\\".  This album gets 5 stars, any maiden fan should like it.  And if you're not a maiden fan then you should be, and thats all i have to say about that.            <BR>                                  Also, one of the best covers.
B0000509BZ|4.0|Christopher Lambert stars as Connor MacLeod, a 450 year old Highlander who has been transported in time to present-day New York.  Following him is his arch-enemy Kurgan, played superbly by Clancy Brown.  Their battle began centuries ago on a basic premise: There is a small group of immortals that live among humanity, and the only way that they can die is by decapitation.  They seem no different in appearance than regular mortals, but their first death sets them at that age forever. (note Lambert's youthful appearance even though he's 450 years old).  They are always engaged in battle and when one decapitates another, he takes his powers (\\"the quickening\\") and at some future time the survivors will face off against one another (\\"the gathering\\") until there is only one survivor, who will become immensely powerful.<br />Sean Connery also stars as Ramirez, who has come to help Connor develop his skills as a swordsman so he can successfully face Kurgan.  Unfortunately, it is Ramirez who pays the price.  <br />I enjoyed this movie and the way it was formatted.  I felt that the flashbacks from the present-day to the past were helpful in understanding the plot and how the relationship between MacLeod and Kurgan developed.  The acting, especially by Lambert and Brown, is first rate.  Sean Connery does a fine job as well.  Its too bad that his role was so short.  The climactic battle between MacLeod and Kurgan is the best part of the film, with the flashing blades and exploding neon signs.  Fantasy and sci-fi fans will surely enjoy this tale, but stay away from the sequels!
B000059HCN|3.0|First of all, I simply wish to say that Ellen Burstyn's performance in this movie was probably the best piece of acting these old eyes have ever seen.  Playing lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, an insecure woman with a loser for a son, Burstyn delivers this role so powerfully and emotionally--particularly as the character succumbs to diet pill addiction--that the viewer is overwhelmed with sadness and compassion.<br />Unfortunately, Sara Goldfarb is the only character worth caring about, as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM tells a parallel story about three heroin addicts.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his best bud Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are hedonistic junkies that only live for their next fix.  Harry is Sara's son, thus the bridge between the two stories.  We're given little or no explanation as to why these three people are strung out on drugs, and when the movie begins, when Harry and Tyrone steal Sara's TV (again) to pawn it for drug money, I said to myself, \\"I really don't care what happens to these characters.\\"<br />Whatever admirable qualities these three people possess are rapidly dissolved in the face of spiraling addiction.  When each one of them \\"hits bottom,\\" I was unmoved.  Also annoying was Harry ruining his left arm by continuing to shoot heroin into it.  Did it ever occur to him to use his other arm, or other veins of his body?  And what could have been a very interesting side story--Tyrone's fond memories of the closeness he shared with his mother--was never developed.<br />REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is as powerful as the pills and smack being consumed, yet director Darren Aronofsky's movie falls short when only one of the four primary characters is salvageable.  For a comprehensive story depicting addiction, I recommend \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" instead.<br />--D. Mikels
B00005NP04|5.0|One look at Martina McBride, and many people wonder how she could have such a strong and distinct voice, but it definitely shines through on her Greatest Hits CD.  Despite her small stature, Martina has a wide vocal range that is evident on all of the songs in this collection.  Such favorites as &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Safe in the Arms of Love&quot;, and &quot;Happy Girl&quot; personify Martina perfectly and her wonderful vocals shine through on these songs.  Of course, her signature song &quot;Independence Day&quot; is included on the CD.  I've seen Martina in concert, and she sounds just as good live as she does on CD.  Buy this excellent CD and hear some uplifting music at its best.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I bought this album with high expectations, but I've gotta say that, except for the first two tracks, this is nothing but average rock. &quot;Cochise&quot;, their first single, compelled me to buy this CD, along with stellar reviews, for a not-so-stellar album. After &quot;Show me How to live&quot; the second track, the songs all begin to sound the same. The lyrics are rather uninspired &quot;I'll wait for you here/Like a stone&quot;, and Chris Cornell's gravelly yet somehow whiny voice begins to get old pretty quick. Instead of buying &quot;Audioslave&quot; I would download the &quot;Cochise&quot; video(it's really unbelievable...during the filming, the LAPD got calls from concerned citizens who thought that LA was under attack...that's just how many fireworks were used) and maybe &quot;Show me how to Live&quot; Other than that, there's much better musaic to buy out there.
B000002KCC|5.0|Neil Young recorded this album in an warehouse (in two weeks).  He and his fellow band mates would spend all day playing music and drinking Tequila, and wouldn't begin recording until very late at night (or early in the morning depending on how you look at it). They usually only did two or three takes per song. This style of recording results in a raw, spontaneous masterpiece. It is definitly darker than his previous albums, and isn't as clean, for it is here that his grunge side was born. The whole album is absolutly solid. Highlight tracks include: \\"Mellow my mind\\", \\"Lookout Joe\\", \\"Speakin' out\\" and \\"Tonight's the Night\\".  If you are a Neil Young fan and you do not own this album...BUY IT NOW!
0140120416|5.0|It's easy to see from the reviews for this book that there are more than one type of language learner. If you want Russian spoon-fed to you, forget it and learn Italian, French, etc. Russian only becomes usable when you have all of the inflected endings organized and stored in your head. And the only way to accomplish that is by studying with some degree of passion. <br />I used this book along with the 3 pimsleur sets on russian and now have a very strong foundation to proceed into advanced studies. This book has a good mix of grammar and texts to translate. I never felt overwhelmed. That said, I progressed on a two-steps-forward and one-step-back basis. You will too if you want to learn Russian, so don't sweat it. It's normal. I was relieved when I got to chapter 10 or so and the book said something about &quot;you have now met X number of words and have probably forgot most of them. That's ok. Just learn them again and it will get easier.&quot;<br />My one regret with the book: I wish there was a workbook for more exercises. The exercises in the book are good, but I had to make up my own to really become accomplished at slinging those endings the way I wanted.<br />Stay away from this book if you are looking for nice phrases for travelers. This book will teach you only if you put the right kind of effort into your studies.<br />I have dozens of books on Russian and this is the one that taught me what I needed to know.
B000001FE0|5.0|Easily their best album prior to their sound-change in the 70s, and their most challenging musically.  Released as a double-album in 1969, it's not long by today's standards (at 64 mins), but it was a radical departure.  Note that on 2 LPs, there were 4 &quot;sides&quot; of music, and on this album they are arranged carefully.<br />The album opens with the 7-1/2 min title track, a hauntingly sad song with wailing discordant vocals and long instrumental passages - accoustic (classical) guitar and cello!  The next two songs fit smoothly into the mood.<br />Side 2 throws a change of pace with the bluesy &quot;Marley Purt Drive&quot;, then the short pieces &quot;Edison&quot; and &quot;Melody Fair&quot; (which should have been a single - they later collected it on &quot;Best of vol 2&quot;).  &quot;Suddenly&quot; has an extremely interesting guitar beginning, and the side trails off with the odd jarring ending of &quot;Whisper Whisper&quot;.<BR> <BR>Side 3 begins with the dramatic chords of &quot;Lamplight&quot;, then the poignant little ballad &quot;Sound of Love&quot;.  At this point the fun relief of &quot;Give Your Best&quot; is very welcome.  Then the album goes right back to serious, with two &quot;classical style&quot; instrumentals.  I particularly like the &quot;Seven Seas Symphony&quot;.<br />Side 4 sneaks up on you with the quiet beginning to &quot;I Laugh In Your Face&quot;.  The great song &quot;First of May&quot; is in this section; sad, like all the other &quot;great&quot; songs on this album.  The album ends with the orchestral piece &quot;British Opera&quot;, which echoes (reprises) the orchestral stuff from side 3, and trails off.<br />The album doesn't quite hang together as a &quot;concept&quot; album; lyrically there are odd departures (Edison?  Whisper Whisper?).  But the sound is very distinctive beginning to end, and the mood is consistently dark and brooding.  Most of all, the adventurous music-making is a hallmark all the way thru.  Every song is very interesting musically, with inventive arrangments and often surprising lyrics.<br />It's a shame that this album broke them up, and that they didn't quite accomplish what they were trying to do.  But what they did accomplish is an absolutely terrific album.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I just finished watching Equilibrium and let me tell u, i am absolutely blown away by it. Made me sit down and writing my first review ever. This is really one of the best Movies I ever saw. Really strong acting, especially Christian Bale , a very good story and these incredible fighting scenes which were really really awesome. Sad that this movie didn't get the attention it deserved, sometimes its really strange to see which movies are busting the block and which are not. If u liked Gattaca and The Matrix (in that order) this is the movie for u. Check it out, u won't regret it.
6304258984|3.0|The last decade of family entertainment has produced few men's films.  \\"The Rock\\" is a notable exception, a man's film that addresses the issue of domestic terrorism.<br />A disgruntled Marine General and his men attack a military weapons depot and steal rockets with chemical warheads.  The General's team seizes Alcatraz and 81 hostages, then threatens to fire the rockets into the City of San Francisco if a monetary ransom is not paid.  The Government assembles a counterterrorism team that includes Navy Seals, an FBI chemical weapons laboratory expert (played by Nicolas Cage), and the only man who knows how to break *into* Alcatraz (played by Sean Connery).<br />\\"The Rock\\" provides an interesting view of military Special Operations in an impressive setting.  The General's team controls the schedule; plus they have advance planning, ample weapons, good communications, and the element of surprise.  The Government's counterterrorism team *reacts*: the Navy Seal team is trained and ready to fight, but Nicolas Cage's chemical weapons expert is a scholar rather than a warrior, and Sean Connery's character (a British agent who learned too much) has been imprisoned for thirty years without a trial.  Nicolas Cage's character reluctantly agrees to join the Navy Seal team -- it is his job.  Sean Connery's character reluctantly agrees to join the Navy Seal team -- it temporarily gets him out of prison.  The General's team attempts to follow their methodical plan.  The counterterrorism team attempts to disrupt that plan.  Each disruption reduces the General's team's threat at the cost of unmanaged bloodshed.<br />The United States currently is at war, and The Department of Homeland Security is concentrating on countering foreign terrorist activity.  In a postwar downsized (stagflating?) United States domestic economy, The Department of Homeland Security probably will be forced to reexamine the threat represented by domestic terrorists using stolen military ordinance.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is one of the best albums ever recorded, it saved rock and roll at that time. And because everyone knows that, I wont be talking how amazing this album is. I want to tell how much the music in these days need a band like Nirvana. Nirvana to me, along with the Beatles, are the only two groups that caused a MANIA, they not only revolutioned the world music, they also caused a big impact in the pop culture, everyone during 91-94 dressed grunge as the people did trying to imitate the Beatles during the 60s. Everything knows that every thing now is ... commercial pop, hip-hop music, there is not one good rock band in these days. Thats why I know that if Kurt Cobain were alive the actual music wouldnt exist. We need a Cobain now because rock will dissapear soon, we need someone that changes all the parameters and doesnt follow any orders from the disc companies or MTV, someone who is a talented songwriter. Is a damn shame that during all these time, since 94, there havent been a single great rock band in America like Nirvana.
B00008H2LE|2.0|Just so you know, this isn't just another review from a Linkin Park hater who never listened to the album. I love Linkin Park, but this album ain't that hot.<br />I have to say that making \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" the leadoff single was a good idea, because it's the best song on the album. \\"Nobody's Listening\\" is pretty good too (except for the dry chorus), and \\"Breaking The Habit\\" is decent, but the rest of the album seriously falls short of what LP are capable of. For instance, Hybrid Theory showcased Chester's screaming blending in well with the songs, but here he's either yelling without really saying anything, or the screaming drowns out the music (Craig Nicholls of The Vines shares the latter problem). And Mike's rhymes are decent, but after a while they start to sound the same.<br />I got the limited edition of this with the bonus DVD, but I didn't even watch it because I was so disappointed with the album.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Bagdad Cafe ranks near the top of my all-time favorite movies list. With wonderful performances by the entire cast (but especially the dynamics between Sagebrecht and Pounder), the focus is on the freeing power of friendship and understanding. Rigidly girdled in tweeds, Sagebrecht is uptight and uncertain, yet curious. Equally girdled in anger, Pounder is frosty and remote. Yet these two women find common ground--without ever pressing the obvious: the fact of their both having been abandoned--to create (literally) magic, even joy. Palance (in one of his non-grotesque roles) is lovely as the heartstruck artist who finds beauty in the winsome Sagebrecht and gently assists in her emancipation. The soundtrack is haunting and unforgettable--&quot;I Am Calling You&quot;-- the perfect accompaniment to a place and time and a group of people whose lives are reinvented and greatly improved as a result of their moving past former imposed constraints (both societal and circumstantial) to find a very real happiness simply in being alive.
6305657947|5.0|Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo make a wonderful couple in this movie that it's actually the new version of the Steve Macqueen's version from 1968.<BR>This story is about a billionaire (Brosnan) who steals a Monet from the Metropolitan Museum in New York and a woman who works for an inssurance company (Russo) has to recover the painting.<BR>In the beginning it all starts as business but the can't hide their attraction.<BR>Their performances are very good.

B00005JKOI|2.0|This teen movie from the 80's has not aged very well.  The clothes look extremely awkward and the class warfare subject is lame.  But it survives as a beginning for James Spader's career of exploring handsome, scary, obsessive men that he has carried further in films \\"Sex, lies and videotape\\" and the recent \\"Secretary\\".<br />Molly Ringwald is pleasant and likeable as Andie, a working class girl with a flair for fashion design.  She has nice chemistry with Andrew McCarthy, who plays a rich drip in love with her.  Rounding out the cast is  a shrill Jon Cryer and a fanstastic Annie Potts.<br />Of course as in all Teen films, Andie is an independent teenager who has that special something that makes every man in the film attracted to her.  Everything chugs along in a predictable pace until James Spader arrives on the scene.  Spader plays trust fund baby Steff who has been smoldering over  Andie since freshman year.  If the producer's conventional casting had worked, this role would have been a one note baddie.  But Spader imbues Steff with a seething, obsessional passion that gives him an emotional weight that makes him appear older than the rest of the cast.  In fact it totally lopsides the whole picture in his direction.  In one great scene, Spader discovers McCarthy dating Ringwald.  The expression on Spader's face runs from shock, pain, disappointment, longing and then rage.  He then spends the rest of the movie stalking Ringwald and trying to keep McCarthy away from her.  It kind of makes a viewer wish there was more backstory added to the Steff-Andie relationship.  Did she at one point like him?  Is he just playing or is he serious about her?  Couldn't John Hughes have added more tension with Andie being involved with Steff.  It all points to lost opportunity.  Ringwald gamely tries to add subtext with Spader but it just leaves her looking a little dumbfounded.<br />Too bad \\"Virgin Suicides\\" was made 15 years too late.  Spader would have made a great Trip Fontaine
0440224764|5.0|This is the first book I've read by John Grisham and I found it very good. The story is thrilling.<br />It's about a lawyer who claims his death, he burns his car and after everybody thinks he's dead, the steals 90 million dollars.<br />The F.B.I hires a guy who has people to find him and they do, but that's just the start of this big story that I strongly recommend it, really, read it.
B00000I8UK|5.0|I never used to listen to very much jazz, but lately it has been a big interest of mine. _Out to Lunch_ was one of my first important jazz purchases in my current exploration, despite some admonitions saying that if one is new to jazz this isn't a good album. Compared to most of yas I'm still a jazz neophyte, but I think this album is AMAZING.<br />Eric Dolphy has one foot in the compositional richness of Mingus and another in the avant-garde -- at the time, Dolphy was boldly stepping beyond tradition. So perfect are these pieces that it can be difficult to tell where composition ends and improvisation begins, and that ambiguity is part of _Out to Lunch_'s hook. Solos build out of the written arrangement and overlay the rhythms; melodically and rhythmically, this is tougher and sharper than most of the jazz I have heard so far. The playing is absolutely great.<br />\\"Hat and Beard\\" is a skittering, tense work. Dolphy's solo trades off with the trumpet, while furious drumming seems to dare Freddie Hubbard to become more aggressive, and he must finally concede to a quiet tintinnabulation of vibes. Here vibist Bobby Hutcherson seems to face conflict of its own as the nervous rhythm continues to exact a stretched eagerness until the main theme makes a return. Mwahaha, I like it. On \\"Out to Lunch\\", Tony Williams' playing is like an entirely new drumming language, superlatively intuitive and subtly emphasizing the perfect notes. In Dolphy's words, \\"Tony doesn't play time, he plays pulse.\\" (Might not really make sense until you hear it though.) In fact, the rhythm work on this whole album is all astonishing and very easily some of the best I've heard. Players scuffle around the a repeated theme with tense solos, baiting other players and everyone takes the spotlight somewhere, occasionally at the same time. \\"Straight Up and Down\\" is a metrical labyrinth, but very swingin' with silvery melodies, achieving accessibility despite complexity. Williams and Richard Davis (bass) are very intense here. The best part is the end, where the initial theme returns with a pendent hum on the vibes -- it's almost disorienting coming out of the tricky stuff, like spinning in circles for a minute or two then stopping and being hit with dizziness. \\"Gazzelloni\\" starts with a catchy harmonious lilt then spirals into free territory that sounds more neatly arranged than it does random -- a testament to the skill of these masters. \\"Something Sweet, Something Tender\\" is a dulcet piece, mellow but rhapsodic. This one uses some deep harmonic languages to convey its feeling.<br />VERY sad that Eric Dolphy passed away shortly after recording _Out to Lunch_, because he probably could have gone on to some amazing work after this. I'm probably still a jazz-dummy and this review may be shoddy, but this is one of the best jazz albums in my collections. I know what i like!e very intense here.

B00008I8IF|4.0|Rainy Day Music is in many ways a return to the familiar sound of Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow The Green Grass. The vocal harmonies sound great and the songwriting is excellent. Unlike Smile, the production on this album stays out of the way of the music. I managed to get an advance copy of the album and it hasn't been far from my cd player for over a week now. Like the early Jayhawks albums, this one gets better the more times you hear it. Only time will tell if it stands up next to those records but at the moment it sounds damn good to me. The bonus disc opens with a rocking Grand Funk Railroad style song that would never have fit the album but sounds great as a bonus or B-side. Also included on the bonus disc is a demo called Caught With a Smile On My Face, which could easily have been my favorite song on the album, but might have disrupted the cohesiveness and probably does best as a bonus. It's a great album.
B000002HFU|5.0|If this CD isn't one of the top five greatest accomplishments of mankind, then I can't imagine what is. Top to bottom, front to back, it is pure auditory pleasure. ODB can, will, and must save you. Seriously, though, people . . . Russell Jones should be your friend. Buy this CD, put it on and remember why music should be like this all the time. \\"Hey, life is fun again. Thank you Ol' Dirty .... You changed my life.\\"
B000089RVX|4.0|Out of every 10 bands I get to hear on the radio and on videos, most of the time all ten of them are really bad. I am not easily impressed with a band, as I have been listening to all forms of Rock and Metal since about 1987, and I have heard a lot of bands. Now, when I heard Evanescence, I really could not believe my ears. The music itself is nothing we really haven't heard before. In fact, this band sounds (instrumentally speaking only) like the band Linkin Park WISHED they could be. The music exhudes a power and passion that LP really can't touch with a 10-mile pole. But, obviously, the singer is a million times better than both LP frontmen combined. If it is not often I am impressed with a band, it is much less often that I actually get chills down my spine when listening to music, and Evanescence has had such an effect on me. The only thing keeping me from giving it a full score is simply that not every single song here is an absoulute winner. But, as a whole, Evanscence really is easily one of the best bands of the last 5 years, head and shoulders above almost all the rap-core and nu-metal garbage that has been forced upon us. As to the title of my review : We all know that this kind of music was almost gone. But, on the heels of a supremely brilliant effort such as this one, other, lesser bands might be able to make an acceptable comeback. If it weren't for Evanescence, it would be another story. I really hope this band can keep releasing albums without rehashing the same thing over and over. This one is great, but we don't really need a carbon copy of it. Time will tell. But as of now, I am enjoying &quot;Fallen&quot; to its fullest.
0786869143|4.0|I saw the author, Dr. Richard Wiseman, on television the day before yesterday and was intrigued, so I bought the book a couple of hours later. I've never particularly considered myself either lucky or unlucky. But I've always felt there was more to luck than mere chance. Wiseman posits just that point.<br />This book reminds me a bit of Dale Carnegie's classic, How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. Carnegie's book was groundbreaking because at the time it was written there was hardly anything in the popular press about worry&Ntilde;as opposed to today. Ha! Likewise, this may be a ground breaking book on the topic of luck. The author's style is similar to Carnegie's&Ntilde;easy to read, upbeat, lots of anecdotes, and &quot;principles&quot; to follow. I especially enjoyed Dr. Wiseman's references to his earlier career as a magician.<br />I'm going to follow the author's advice and keep a &quot;Luck Journal&quot; for the next thirty days. Thus far, one hour after finishing the book, I've found one penny on the sidewalk.
B00006WKY9|5.0|Well, I don't know if I should say a sweeping statement like that, but its in the \\"top 5\\" for me. All great songs, no filler, and none of Uli's controversial singing! \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\" is their \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" - a power ballad to conquer all others. Come solo time, and it goes off to the (Strat)osphere! It blows away most of today's shredders and of course we get to \\"Sails of Charon\\" which is the crown jewel of this album. Covered by everyone from Testament to Yngwie, this is the beginning of the Neo Classical metal genre. Queen may have laid the groundwork, but a listen to the solos in this one and you can hear the true beginning of the genre. \\"He's a Woman, She's a Man\\" may have been one of the things that ticked Uli off to leave, and its the beginning of drummer Herman Rarebell's<br />controversial lyric writing in the band, but it is a proto thrash song that predicts the heavier side of NWOBHM! And this is from Germany!<br />Overall, this album has some of the best variety of Uli era<br />Scorpions, and is the one essential piece of music that everyone should have.
B000002J1S|5.0|The fantastic journey Genesis takes you on is unbelievable. Music and lyrics are so well balanced.

With metaphors like &quot;The Superntural Anaesthtist&quot;,they are a poets dream. This music is classic and timeless.

On the other hand, the bad guy in none other than Cap.Picard himself as his clone. By the way, he looked more like a clone of Kojak than Picard, what a shame!<BR>The plot is so full of flaws and so illogical that sometimes I think that Mr.Rick Bermann take the fans as stupid people. It is the worst Star Trek movie ever and I hope it is the last because I cant stand this disrespect towards Gene Roddenberrys legacy.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This film is amazing. At first I thought it was too weird to be good with all the spirity stuff, but as the story unfolded it turned to have a rich and creative story. The animation was beautiful and colorful. There was also lots of fast action. Although people might find humans turning into pigs and giant slimy spirits taking baths strange they will still see that this was the best animated film made in years.
1575666286|5.0|Much like the previous poster, I also suffered a degenerative disease.  I did the research for a cure while healing from some conventional radiation therapy.  I began the Gerson Therapy (GT)as indicated in this book in part, started feeling stronger and got into it full tilt.  I must admit, Dr. Max Gerson MD, the author's father, hit the nail on the head in terms of a curative therapy. His is some heirloom information and techniques that have survived because they work. <br />If you need to buy a book on how to get well from degenerative disease, this is the first choice.  Get started now. Begin now.  Disease as simple as arthritis, and as tough as cancer respond to this therapy. I know from personal experience also. The program is nutritional and detoxification with minimum supplements.  The book informs as to what and why and when to use what.  They do not sell vitamins, or expensive publications, just straight forward truth. <br />I also, particularily for Multiple Myeloma or Plasmacytoma patients, but cancer patients generally, highly recommend the book, 'Living Proof', by Michael Gearin-Tosh, published 2002. It is a wonderful narrative of how to approach cancer treatment written by a man diagnosed MM but who did Gerson Therapy and lives. <br />Do it, get well, and write your own review ! I'll be checking back from time to time. God Bless.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is one the best I have ever heard. <BR>Losing Grip, I love this song. I love the music and Avril's vocals are great.<br />Complicated, This song did get a little old after a while, but I still love listening to it.<BR>Sk8er Boi, This song is a &quot;fun&quot; song. I love the story it tells.<br />I'm With You, This is the first slow-er song on Let Go. It's one of my favorites.<br />Mobile, I love this song. Again the music and vocals are really good here. <br />Unwanted, This has a more rock edge to it. It's another one of my favorites.<BR>Tomorrow, This is the second slower song. It's mostly a guitar, and Avril but it's still really good. <br />Anything But Ordinary, This is by far the best song on the album. I don't understand why this wasn't a single.<br />Things I'll Never Say, I love the beat of this song.<br />My World, I just love this song. It's funny.<BR>Nobodys Fool, I really like this on too.<br />Too Much to Ask, this song has a story too. It's sort of slow.<br />Naked, This is my second favorite song. I love it.
B0000027I6|5.0|This album is simply a masterwork.  Very emotional songs, arranged in a devastatingly powerful manner, all set to convery Waters' message of a society beset by false images and false realities.  <BR>There is a book by Neil Postman titled \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\" which echoes this message, and, I suppose (but I have no idea) that Rogers must have taken his inspiration from it.
0385006896|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is such a good book. Watson is the narrator. He meets Holmes in a hotel. Holmes uses logic to make theories. Holmes and Watson solve mysteries. And Holmes is always right. And Holmes is always observant and he sees every detail of the scene. All of the scenes are in London; Holmes is a very smart man. I am reading the first collection and all I know is there are tow or more book collections. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the author of this book. You should read this book. It is a very good book. Be observant.

B000066F6H|3.0|The music on here is actually pretty good, unlike the very disappoing Vine's Highly Evolved (How could NME name that one of the best debut albums of all time).  But the album is hard to love because it is like playing one song over and over and over again.  The album is repetitive to be simply.  The tracks sound good apart but when you put them together it is like they continue to copy songs from their previous albums.  Yes the Hives are probably better than a good deal of the stuff on MTV but then again that is not saying a whole lot.  If all the songs at least sounded very strong and sounded as if they could be singles, then the album would probably be better.  But a good portion of it is filler.  Main Offender is definitely the best song on the album and is a very fine song.  Hate To Say I Told You So, Metric System Of Time, and Outsmarted are all also good tracks.  So I suppose I would recommend this album if you wanted to listen some pretty decent modern rock radio music.  But if you are looking for the best &quot;New Rock Revival&quot; group I'd choose the White Stripes over them any day.
0345448898|5.0|If you LOVE Harry Potter, than pick up His Dark Materials. These books are about a twelve year old girl named Lyra Silvertonuge, (my favorite charater) and her adventures with her deamon Pantaliamon, her friends Serafina Pekkala, the queen of her witch clan, Iorek Byrnison, the bear king, the Aletheometer, the truth instrument that Lyra learns to read, and her new friend Will Parry, who becomes more than a friend...<BR>This book is the best after Harry Potter. It is something worth picking up and reading.
B00008H2LB|4.0|The very first song I heard from Linkin Park was Pushing Me Away and I still remember exactly how I felt when I first heard it.  I loved it because it related exactly to an experience I had had recently. I felt like I was connected somehow to the band that created the song. It was just amazing that I heard it right when I was feeling that way and I have loved every song Linkin Park has made ever since.  I think they are a very talented group and one of my very favorites!  Although I love everything about the CD they have just put out... the only thing I was disappointed about was that most of the songs I really liked were really short.. like not even more than 3 minutes.  I hate that they are that short because I loved the songs so much and it ended too soon!!  :)  But its a good CD I love it!  Keep up the good work Linkin Park, I love your music.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is justifiably considered one of the classics of Science Fiction. Many of the created societies in sci-fi feel one dimensional and antiseptic, but Frank Herbert created one of the most realistic and belivable futures in the genre. Dune was described in one of these customer reviews as what would happen if James Clavell wrote sci-fi. I couldn't agree more. It shares the same narraritive techniques as a Clavell novel, the same complex plot, and if Herbert isn't quite as entertaining a writer as Clavell, the ideas he presents are extremely fascinating.<BR>  Much of what drives Dune is two subjects largely absent from most science fiction: biology and religion.<BR>When I say religion I  mean religion as a social phenomena. In the few instances religion appears in sci-fi it is often presented in a smug or condescending way. But religion has been a large social force throughout recorded history and Herbert postulated, not unreasonably, that it will continue to be so.<BR>If it is not surprising that religion gets such short shrift, it is surprising how little attention biology gets in most Science-fiction. Authors conversant in PhD level physics often have no conception of the basic tenets of biology or ecology (though to be fair this failing is more pervalant in TV sci-fi). But in 'Dune' it is the ecology of the planet Arrakis that shapes the Fremen, and the religion based on Paul Maud'dib and jihad that shapes the galaxy.
B00005JLKN|4.0|Silence of the Lambs, one of cinema's modern masterpieces is around number six of my all-time favorite movies. I can't figure out why, since my number one and two are, respectively, It's a Wonderful Life and The Wizard of Oz. I find myself mesmerized by the superior acting of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins time and time again, as well as Ted Tally's intense script and the superb directing job of Jonathan Demme.<br />So, it comes as a surprise that I completely avoided this movie as it danced through the theaters on its first run. Why? The ultimate disappoint of Hannibal still lingered, proving that even wonderful acting does not a movie make. I couldn't bear the disappointment once again.<br />But,  what I found, after watching the Red Dragon, was an intense, edgy thriller that was surprisingly good, delivering mucho bang for the buck<br />Brought on by the, dare I say it, franchising of America's favorite fictional serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Red Dragon offers an all-star cast, with a story that sometimes tries to mirror Silence of the Lambs much too often.<br />Anthony Hopkins reprises his role of hungry Dr. Lecter yet once again. He's done it so much I wouldn't be surprised to see a Dr. Lecter cameo on \\"Scrubs\\" or a new Fox reality show, \\"Budget Gourmet, starring Hannibal\\". Yet he creeps and crawls around, much more effectively then his turn in Hannibal.<br />Edward Norton effectively plays the pseudo-psychic detective Will Graham, with the appropriate amount of regret and intensity. Baffled by two gruesome family murders, he attempts to unravel the secrets of the \\"Tooth Fairy\\", wonderfully played by one of my favorite actors today, Ralph Fiennes. I go so boldly as to say that dear Ralph steals the picture from Hannibal, who appears in a few scenes here and there as a more secondary role this time. Beset and bewildered, Mr. Tooth Fairy finds himself enamored by a blind technician at work (wonderfully portrayed by dear Emily Watson), so much so that his inner turmoil intensifies.<br />In fact, for me, one of the most fascinating aspects of this film lies in the relationship between  those two characters: blind girl and psychotic killer. Let's face it, we've all seen the story of lone detective solving the case by finding the one clue that everyone else in the movie has missed. Ho-hum! No, the interesting dynamic of this film lies in that relationship, how each interplay with one another; how blind girl brings an innocent sensitivity to someone whose life is nothing but infected, scab ridden emotional scars ready to tear open again; how psychotic killer tries to open up to that gift. That Ralph and Emily pull it off so well makes the film for me.<br />What this film lacks is the much missed directing style of Demme. His flair and style is unique, and added so much tension to Silence. Brett Ratner gives it a good go, but the Hannibal cell scenes left me longing for darkness, shadows, and possibly even Jodie. In fact, that's another problem with the film. It tries much too hard to set up Silence of the Lambs. I ask, why? Silence certainly didn't need any introduction, and the audience itself (except for a few lamebrainers out there) would already know this was a prequel. He should have allowed Red Dragon to stand on its own two feet, or two talons, instead of leaning too much on the next movie down.<br />And I do hope this lays to rest Dr. Hannibal Lecter. As compelling a character as he is, it's time to bid the ol' body muncher a fond farewell. We've enjoyed the time we've spent together, but rest he should, and only terrorize us in our dreams from now on.<br />6/10 starsinner turmoil intensifies.<br />In fact, for me, one of the most fascinating aspects of this film lies in the relationship between  those two characters: blind girl and psychotic killer.

B00008H2LB|4.0|This is a great cd, the tracks flow together in almost any order, which make the CD easy to listen to while at work or home.  I always enjoy the mix of harsh guitar and rhythmic beats, Meteora brings energy and angst together in a tight little package.<br />That's the problem you see.  It's too little.  The CD is just short of fourty minutes long.  That's pretty much the only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating from me.<br />If you like Linkin Park, you won't be dissapointed.  If you are looking for somthing energetic with meaningful lyrics (if a bit agnsty (??)) you'll like it...  anyway, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, unless you looking for Celine Dion.. eek ;)
0385504209|5.0|How many times do you read that someone \\"couldn't put it down\\", and then, when you read it, you're putting it down to see what's on TV? Well, in this case, it's not an exaggeration. Simply put, Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is THE \\"can't put down\\" novel of Spring, 2003.<br />Part rousing fiction thriller, part historical treatise, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" spins the tale of secret societies, religious fervor, all intertwined in the brilliant mind of one Leonardo Da Vinci. Robert Langdon, symbologist, is called to the Louvre in the middle of the night after the death of an important curator. Suddenly, he is plunged into the vortex of a criminal investigation that is both in and out of his control. Once the mystery starts, it simple doesn't stop or even slow down.<br />Dan Brown's writing style is brisk, inventive, and not terribly deep, which is absolutely perfect for this genre. Each chapter is only a few pages long, which moves the story from one locale to another without so much as a blink. Just as you get involved in one thread, it stops at a crucial point, and he picks up the second thread. It's perfectly attuned to keep you in tune with this book.<br />Be prepared to see \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" on the bestseller list for months to come. And read it before everyone else does!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|HELL YEAH MAN! This is, by far, the best of their three! I just back from the cd storeand playd it all the way through, and it's insane! They haven't changed their sound one bit, so I don't want anyone saying that the sold out! I'll personally kick anyone that says that. And they have the same kind of set-up with that last 2 songs as they did on Awake. second to last song is a lead in, and The lst track is one of the best onthe cd. You'll hear everything you love about Godsmack on this cd, and more! Faceless, the title track, has a realy nice gituar solo in it. And I'm sure many people will be excited that I Stnd Alone appears on this cd, I know that made me happy. GET THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!

0451169514|5.0|Anyone that does not understand what IT is, in the book IT, is has to read other Stephen King books. His books are linked around the Dark Tower series, in which King takes H.P. Lovecraft's monsters and other worlds to the limit. The sexual situation at the end of the book has to do with \\"Ka\\" (read/learn about it from his other books), and the demon in Dark Tower #3 who rapes Mrs.Walker.

B00003CXCW|5.0|SUNSET BLVD. is one of the great cinema classics, period. The noirish look of the film is the best aspect of it. The opening scene beautifully sets the tone of the movie. The shot of Bill Holden's lifeless corpse floating aimlessyly in the pool is one of the best shots in cinema history. Wilder is known for taking brilliant opening shots that nicely set the tone of the film, like the booze bottle shot in the opening of THE LOST WEEKEND. But it is the acting that makes this movie. Gloria Swanson as the faded silent movie star is breath taking. She steals all the scenes from Bill Holden. Don't get me wrong, Holden is brilliant as well, but the character of Norma Desmond is what makes this picture. There are some other stunning performances as well. Erich von Stroheim's butler is fantastic. The cinematography too, is amazing. The script by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder is the base for this classic. It is a very good script. This movie is the real definition of a classic. Kudos to Billy Wilder and thank you for blessing us with this movie!
B0000026JR|3.0|Knowing this band from FDU days, it's surprising to hear them as...a hair band? The first three tracks especially have a very Judas Priest-type of sound. Fortunately, the singer settles back into his own voice with the fourth track, and the mayhem resumes. Personal taste- I really can't stand music from the late 80's, but I can make an exception for this album, it's really well done. It suffers a little from Manowar disease: you know, the songs are all Serious. The sense of fun from their earlier albums is missing. I don't need songs about Warriors and Crimson Storms, I live in the 20th-errr, 21st Century. I drive a car, not a horse, and I don't eat hearts. Anyway, you know what Freud would say about that preoccupation with swords. That's why music like this can feel silly sometimes. A lot of that is a product of the time, but great music stands the test of time. So, this isn't great, but it's good. With Riot you can always count on great musicianship, better songwriting than almost all other metal bands, and lots and lots of energy. Especially noteworthy are the epic &quot;Bloodstreets&quot; and the furious &quot;Run For Your Life&quot; (not the song of the same title from FDU).

Give me a break! Films like this are such a bad influence on people they are the kind of films that make people who have not had sex yet feel guilty. Reality wise there is nothing to feel guilty about yet if you have not had sex as a young adult don't play around until you find the right person. The annoying cast was cast perfectly every annoying young actor you would suspect today is in this movie I had to laugh when I saw that kid from Rookie of the Year in this movie it looks like Henry Rowengarter is now looking to get (...). The movie has so many dumb scenes its terrible don't these folks worry about anything else but getting laid. I also had to laugh at the Mr Cool lacrosse/Choir player he's real cool isn't he? What a Lemon of a movie.
0553213105|5.0|I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.<BR> Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'. <BR> There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.<BR> Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.<BR> The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.   <BR> I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is Godsmacks answer to Metallica's Master Of Puppets. It blazes from start to finish. The band continues to grow away from their Alice In Chains sound and into their own dark, grinding nightmare. I love the face that the songs are a little longer than typical radio edits. There is a ton of emotion packed here too. BUY THIS ALBUM!

Its probably the last show of a quality band, with extremely impressive guitars and drums backing it. This album is a glimps at what alternative music should sound like.

B0000027DJ|4.0|Alice was on such a career roll at the time of \\"Hey Stoopid\\" that there was a superstar guest list of all sorts of folks ready to pay homage. Or were they just ready to join in the fun? Members of Guns'n'Roses, Motley Crue, even Ozzy Prince of Bleepin' Darkness himself were in the line up for this post-\\"Trash\\" triumph. Alice makes the most of it here, with two Cooper Classics. \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\" is a made for the stage snarler that was cool enough to be included in the \\"Wayne's World\\" movie, and the title song was a just say no crusher from a man who knows all too well what addiction does. There's also a pretty clever piece of Alice Drama in \\"Love's A Loaded Gun.\\"<br />The other interesting note is that, in \\"Wind Up Toy,\\" little Steven wanders back into the nightmare. It's a fore-shadowing of Alice's upcoming (and in my opinion, superior) \\"The Last Temptation.\\" \\"Hey Stoopid\\" is worth having on that basis alone!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is not as hard as the other one.  Yes it does have a couple of headthrobbing eardrum busting tracks but not as many as the last.  In no way was I expecting this cd to top Hybrid Theory.  That is why a lot od people are expecting, and that is y they were so dissapointed.  When a band has an album that good it is almost impossible to topit.  But all in all I like the cd.  Reanimation just made me mad it ruined all of their songs but this is their redemption album and it is good.
B00000FBRE|5.0|Lagwagon has been around for a while now, and their sound seems to change with every CD they release.  This time, however, they've hit upon a style that defines Cali-punk in every way, with Joey's melodic voice, meaningful lyrics, and fast paced rhythms.  This CD starts off fast, and never lets down!  Songs like &quot;may 16th&quot; are a classic, and are known by everyone in the punk scene.<BR>Lagwagon has become a driving force in punk music.  This CD represents exactly what punk music should be and is a must have for any fan of the genre.
B000002JSJ|4.0|It's hard to be objective with Presence when comparing it to the releases that came before it. How does one top &quot;IV,&quot; &quot;Houses of the Holy,&quot; and the sprawling &quot;Physical Graffiti?&quot; Also, this disk was recorded at a time when the band was suffering a bit from its lifestyle and Robert Plant was recovering from a serious auto accident.<br />What they do is take a back to basics approach, performing as a band with guitars, bass, drums and Plant's vocals. No acoustic guitars or keyboards, just hard rocking Led Zeppelin. While this is effective, there is a noticeable lack of the dynamics of earlier releases and the eclectic variety that made Led Zeppelin be able to pull off a hard rock tune with mandolins.<br />The two key tracks on Presence are &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine.&quot;<br />&quot;Achilles&quot; has a galloping triplet bassline, some of Bonham's best drumming, and layers of Page guitar lines. It's an epic cross of &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; and &quot;Song Remains the Song.&quot;<br />&quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; begins with a classic Page guitar lick, drenched in effects and gradually building in volume, then mimicked by Plant's vocals. The bass/drum rhythms are tricky here, with lots of stop/start mechanics. Plant's performance is memorable, with such gems as &quot;m-m-m-monkey on my back&quot; or &quot;no-no-no-no-no-nooooo...nobody's fault but mine&quot; plus the return of the harmonica.<br />&quot;For Your Life&quot; is okay, but kind of a castoff from Physical Graffiti. &quot;Royal Orleans&quot; has some cool funk rhythms. &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; was a single issue from this release, but I don't think it stands up against their other, more superior work.<br />&quot;Tea For One&quot; closes things out with a return to the blues.<br />Some may have thought that Led Zeppelin was burned out, but they would make an excellent return with &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; followed by their greatest band tragedy.atest band tragedy.

This Album now two discs is a big improvement(not that it already wasn't great). The album sounds much clearer and in a general sense better. The new b-sides and the rehersal recordings are great. I recommend this to any SY fan.
0553573403|5.0|Definitely worth a read through.  In the novels, the well-developed characters are multidimensional and true to form.  It is refreshing that the characters in the series experience true losses and not just temporary setbacks that come out for the best at the close of the story.  Overall a very well written peice of work.  If epic fantasy is your genre, I would strongly advise you to take a long look at George Martin's work.

This cd is definitely one worth listening to.  I guarantee that it will put a smile on your face.
B00004TJK2|4.0|I love this movie.  The cinematography is beautiful and the story is bittersweet.  It's a look inside the lives of free divers, a sport that very few people even know about.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Don't get me wrong about the 3 stars....This album has more to offer then most anything else that will come out this year....and i fall more in love with meg with every drum beat...but all this album really did for me was make me realize how great an album De Stijl is (which I am listening to as I write this). If your new to the Stripes, I recommend you pick that album up if you really want to experience what all the fuss is about, then pick up White Blood Cells - This is a good album...but it can wait.
0784011176|5.0|This was a great film. A definite for the dvd collection.
B000063V8T|4.0|Previous reviewers have hit the high points of Season 5, which include Inner Light (best ep of the year and one of the best in the entire series), Time's Arrow, Damrok, and Ensign Ro. There are also a run of pretty good episodes, including Ethics, Disaster, The Perfect Mate, and A Matter of Time. Even when you take another step down to the average stuff, such as Unification, Cause and Effect, Silicon Avatar, Violations, The Next Phase, and so on, it's reasonably engaging SciFi fare that while I can joke about the writing, I still enjoy.<br />However, there are also a slightly uncomfortable number of episodes here that range from boring and/or obvious (Hero Worship, Connundrum, Cost of Living, Power Play) down to the truly awful (The Game, The Outcast). What's with the kids? So many episodes in this season have small children as central or major characters, it gets a little tiresome at some point. I thought Star Trek: TNG had gotten past that phase with the departure of Wesley. And what's with alien possession thing? A lot of those eps also, given it's not exactly a great plot device. At least the holodeck seems to be out of commission for a while.<br />It's interesting to see the texture - much like Seasons 3 and 4, Season 5 starts out with a so-so cliffhanger resolution, but then picks up with a number of very strong episodes - only to fade hard and fast in the middle, but redeem itself with generally strong final episodes.<br />So as with some previous seasons, I have to sigh, and say yes, as a Star Trek fan, I'm glad I have this season, which has some very nice highlights and eps that are fun to watch. But, as I work my way through the new DVD releases, I am always shocked at just how uneven the writing is; especially in light of the new standards that have been set by Babylon 5 and especially the X-Files (compare Cause and Effect, an episode I thought was good at the time, to the X-Files Season 6 episode \\"Monday\\" - same premise, almost exactly the same general idea, but see how much more skillfully it's executed by that show). A somewhat unfortunate feature of Season 5 is the preponderance of \\"soft\\" episodes, episodes that focus on characters and ideas more than plot. Sometimes (The Inner Light, The Perfect Mate, The Masterpiece Society), their efforts are very impressive; then they turn around and churn out Ethics, The Game, The Outcast, or The First Duty, which feel more like being beaten with a club. Then there are episodes like Power Play, in which things happen for the sole reason that they have to happen to set up later things. Entire scenes are frequently wasted with worthless technobabble, a tradition unique to Star Trek that continues to this day, and that they could afford to lose. Opportunities for real character exploration are routinely missed. Episodes with dual plot lines rarely support each other.<br />So as I say, I'm a bit conflicted. A few really good eps; it's impossible to say too many good things about Inner Light or Darmok. Many solid ones, a few terrible ones; inconsistent writing even in episodes that generally succeeed; not a terrifically consistant season. I'm still happy with my purchase, but realistically these DVDs remain too expensive in my opinion, and I wish they had been a bit cheaper or better.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS MUST ADD TO THE OTHER TWO THE ALBUM IS SOLID FROM START TO THE END A MUST HAVE,GODSMACK PUTS OTHERS TO REST WITH THERE SOUND AND THERE TALENT ALL AROUND IS SOLID,SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ORDER IT UP,AND JOIN THE VOODOO TRIBE WHY YOUR AT IT,HIDDEN TRACKS AND MORE ON THE DISC!!!
B00006AW2J|5.0|That's a pretty strong statement, and it could be argued pretty hotly, so I'll leave the question marks in.  But I'll lay on the line that this is the best Stones album ever (followed by Let It Bleed).  Every song is first rate, even the novelty Dear Doctor. The performances seem almost hyper-inspired, like tightly controlled mania.  The music just flat out excites me out of my skin.  My fellow reviewer, \\"A music fan from Orange, CA\\" did a nice song-by-song description, and I agree with many of his (or her - although he talks like a guy) observations and \\"favorite moments\\", so I'll limit myself to a some favorite moments and comments he/she didn't mention.<br />Sympathy for the Devil: One of the greatest song intros and build-ups ever, right up there with Gimme Shelter (from Let It Bleed).  It's tough to love the Stones sentiments sometimes, but I do NOT consider this a satanic song.  It is a chilling warning that things are not what they seem, and that a destructive force is on the loose.  Thanks for the warning, Mick!<br />Street Fighting Man: There's that long whining sound during the instrumental and conclusion.  I remember reading somewhere that it's Brian Jones playing some kind of Asian version of a clarinet.  The way it mixes with Nicky Hopkins' jangling piano is stunning, like a cry of despair.  <br />Prodigal Son and Stray Cat Blues: Keith Richard shines brightly on these tracks.  He is hitting his creative peak here and on Let It Bleed, and he does it strumming, picking or slashing.<br />Salt of the Earth: The masterpiece of the album, with moving lyrics, great vocals (even by Keith), and fantastic use of the choir - much better even than in You Can't Always Get What You Want (from Let It Bleed), and the frenetic finish just leaves you craving more.<br />Take off the question marks!  This IS the greatest rock album of all time!
B000007MVM|5.0|Syd Barrett was kicked out of his beloved Pink Floyd after his what can be described as almost heroric intake of LSD had finally taken to far a mental affect on him. The madcap Laighs which was his 1st solo album shows that under that surface, the genius still that had created The Piper at the Gates of Dawn still existed. The songs on this album, while not the same loudness as Piper, still has the same quality of song. Some of the later songs on the album such as She took a Long cold Look, Feel, If its in You, and Dark Globe show Syd pretty stressed ,even not being able to choose a note to sing on in 1 of them, but even these are remarkebly good. No Mans land with its acid guitar, and No good Trying are probally the closest Syd comes to the loudness of the old Floyd days. Terrapin, which begins the album is a real nice gentle love song, Love You and Here I Go are other love songs but they have much more of a beat to them. The best track on the album is Octopus, which was alo the only single Syd released in his solo years. It's a really fast and happy song with lyrics that are tettering on the brink of nonsesne but can also sense, its also where the album gets its title from.
0618084746|5.0|At first I didn't know what to think when I finished this book. It was such a page turner and the end was like a train wreck for all of the characters. I almost felt like it was without hope. When I thought about it further, though, I reconsidered. The characters in the story don't emerge unscathed or exalted from tragic or mundane circumstances, but neither to most of us in the real world. It would have been great if Mick had been able to become a composer like she wanted, but don't most people who dream of greatness ultimately end up somewhere in between. That doesn't make life or people less valuable. The interesting characters were not at all what they appeared to be on the surface. Reading about them made the book worth reading.
B00004WKII|5.0|The Jimi Hendrix box set assembles fifty six previously unreleased or unavailable recordings that span the guitarist's legendary career.

B00005JLF5|1.0|Weak scripts, boring episodes, overrated \\"Q\\" and nothing to do with the starship Enterprise and the idea of Gene Roddenberry... a ... spinn-off of the real Star Trek series, regardless of the DVD itself.
B000002JS6|5.0|if you can only buy one acdc album its this one. this album has the 2 best acdc songs in my opinion on it with \\"hells bells\\" and \\"back in black\\". but the songs don't get weaker after those two. \\"shoot to thrill\\", \\"given the dog a bone\\" and \\"have a drink on me\\" are also some of acdc's best work. if the cd has any flaws its with the 2 tracks \\"let me put my love into you\\" and \\"rock and roll ain't noise polution\\". However all cds have flaws even the greatest hits album.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I don't know how the editorial interview concluded that this was a good album. Quite frankly, it was average at best. So why only one star? Because their first two albums were incredible, and compared to this one--its horrible. The only good song on the album was &quot;I stand alone,&quot; which you can get off the Scorpion King soundtrack. At least with the soundtrack you get some other good songs. This was a huge let down from their first two albums. I can't believe I wasted 15 bucks on this title. Maybe it will grow on me, but my first impression is a horrible one.

B00006L7XQ|4.0|It's been a long time since I picked up a Johnny Cash album.  I remember listening to him a lot back in the 1960s, but since then he's kinda faded from my radar.<br />Then I heard &quot;Hurt&quot;.<br />This single song would make any album worth the price of admission.  Here Cash, well into his 60s, takes a Trent Reznor song and says, &quot;Come here, boy.  Let me show you how it's done.&quot;  What had previously been a self-indulgent tune by a twentysomething bemoaning the &quot;unfairness&quot; of life becomes a song of desperate pain by someone who has been there, done that, ate the burger and worn the t-shirt.  In fact this song is so powerfully interpreted it is difficult to listen to more than a couple of times.  Cash is a man who has faced many demons and every single one of them makes a brief appearance in his vocals.<br />The rest of the album is hit and miss.  &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; is definitely heartfelt, if not 100% successful.  &quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot; is a true old-school C/W tune, something that is embarrassing the the current crop of Country stars, but truer to the roots of the music.  &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; is not bad, but feels a bit overproduced.  &quot;Hung My Head&quot; is another great tune, a cover of a Sting tune, and again I feel it is better than the original.  There is a sadness and power to Cash's vocals that is missing in the original.  &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, while touching, just points out how weak Johnny's voice has grown of the years; you can hear every waver, dropped note, and touch-off-key moment, which detracts from the delivery.  &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, yes the Depeche Mode song, is quite good; my favourite version is still D-M's accoustic version, but this is good and takes an interesting tilt, given Johnny Cash's religious beliefs.  Quite a solid cut.  &quot;In My Life&quot; is, sadly, much like &quot;Saw Your Face&quot; -- Cash's voice is weak and quavering, although there is a lot of soul to it.  &quot;Sam Hall&quot; allows Johnny to have some fun on an old standard.  Well done and easy to join in on!  &quot;Danny Boy&quot;.  Woo boy... This old turkey will never go away and this is far from a stellar rendition.  &quot;Desperado&quot; is a touch weak in the vocals, but again there is a feeling to it that can only be acquired by the passing of years; yeah, the original was slicker, but this is far more heart-felt and powerful, despite the quavers.  &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, &quot;Tear STained Letter&quot;, and &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; feel like a bit of a time-warp -- back to 1950s and 1960s C/W music, unapologetic, nothing electric, full of sentiment and yodels.  Not too bad if you like the style.<br />The album ends with &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot;.  Now I /know/ this is an old big band standard, but I always bring up images of the closing moments of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; when I hear it, with all those mushroom clouds billowing about.  I'm not sure what Cash meant to do with this song, but it has a weirdly chilling effect when I listen to it.  <br />So there you go -- several covers, some nods to Old School Country-Western, and one original tune.  Somehow it feels like a compilation of Johnny Cash's life in one album, if not necessarily his own works.  You could do far worse than to listen to it!
B000002UJQ|4.0|Well,In fact,I hesitated writing my review on this.Because I'm an Asian girl so I can't write but also speak English very well.<BR>But I'd like to express my feeling about this album and radiohead to people who live in around the world.I think that most of people who read this review are fan of this album or artist.So I believe that it can make us one.:) <BR>When I listen No surprises,I feel like just dreaming.It means that I feel like walking some space of the universal.I don't know exactly why I feel like that.Anyway I love it so much.(Especially,no surprises is so popular in Asia.) Exit music makes me so sad.But l love this like a feeling.I enjoy that.Many people can say that most of songs of radiohead tends to be melancholy.But I think that each of songs have own special things.It's hard to explain.But I can feel.Paranoid Android is also soooooo beautiful.I can't imagine.<BR>The best attractive point of radiohead's songs are melodies and Tom's voice.Tom york has very wonderful voice to sing his songs.Ah,I cannot help writing about lyrics.I can't read and translate all words of radiohead's lyrics but I usually understand meaning of those.There are many koreans who like radiohead and their music.I'll watch radiohead and listen their music.I believe that they wouldn't make me disappointed.
B00005OM4N|3.0|britny, to me, is a genuine artist but the music she makes lacks depth. that being said, i will admit i think she is over-hyped but there is still something special there.  although christina has a better voice and better music and it strikes me as funny that despite her shortcomings Britney still remains the queen of pop.  i listened to this cd and i mean really listened.  i question some of my fellow reviewers.  did you really listen to this music or pop it in and let in confirm what you already think and that being that this music stinks.  <BR>    i spent a week with this cd and found that i liked OVERPROTECTED with its strong vocals that spewed a sense of emotion and a sense of urgency in the delivery.  BOMBASTIC LOVE was another one that i was tapping my foot to.  the music was pretty good too.  finally, the chorus of CINDERELLA was another one that had my head grooving and my feet moving.  <BR>     all in all this cd is bubblegum music that has a dance beat and although played with guitars never sounds like it.  the music is synthesized to be ear candy and there in lies the reason i was curious about this cd and britney.  i wanted to know what they hype was all about.  the hype was wrong.  the god awful version of I LOVE ROCK AND ROLL is grounds for a good whipping.  this is not rock music so why choose a cover like this?  <BR>     i found the other music bland and uninteresting as well as quite generic because it all sounds the same.  one thing i will mention is that when i bought cristina's cd entitled STRIPPED i was pleaseantly surprised at the diversity of music.  the blues style music of WALK AWAY, the rock edge to FIGHTER and the latin-esque INFATUATION all help the music stay varied and thus intersting.  Britney is straight pop and for someone like me, who is not an avid fan of pop, it all tends to blend together into one long song whereas cristina's cd held my attention because the music was genuinely interesting.    <BR>    there were moments and songs i liked on Britney;s cd but generally speaking this cd is a racier modern version of debbie gibson.  they claim Britney to be the next \\"madonna\\" which i scoff at.  Madonna has a cd , like RAY OF LIGHT, which is such a beautiful trip into electronica.  Britney needs to vary her sound, her style and let other influences bleed into her style.  this cd has patches of ear candy but for me it is the coal in your christmas stocking.

0385720920|5.0|Don't read this. This is how Chuck Palahniuk's latest deadpan novel begins, and it just gets odder from there. The story of one poor man's journey for self-worth, this book has some very enlightening and amusing moments, such as his description of the first pronography the sex-addicted main character ever sees. I can see the resemblance to Fight Club that other reviewers have noticed, and criticized, but those criticisms fall on deaf ears for me. The characters are very different, although they do share superficial similarities and their goals are the same. However, the generation that I am part of has a dearth of moral character anyway, and it seems that we, more than any other generation, need a reason to thrive, a reason to survive. This book describes a man in the same position as most of the men of any generation born after 1960. We wander aimlessly looking to give our lives some purpose. So, yes, it has similarities to his cult hit, but it has its own unique characteristics which make it enjoyable anyway.<br />I don't know whether to laugh at some parts of this, incredulous at the places you can get a good philosophical question to pose, or to laugh at it, reveling in the insanity that is vintage Palahniuk. In the middle of otherwise plebian circumstances, poor Victor contemplates his existence in the world, and tries to deny who he is. When he finally comes to term with who he is, the rug is pulled out from under him again, and he loses every shred of reality that he has acquired and must rebuild. This patient, relentless journey alone is enough to buy this book. The philosophical questions posed and the witty banter (internal, of course, since Denny and Victor seem rather...dim) make the book a treasure.<br />Don't read it. But if you do, don't expect to be saved. If you are, don't save anyone else. Above all else, don't lend this book! I have already lost one copy of it that way, and don't intend to have to buy it again. But if it gets lost, I will have to shell out the money, grinning all the while.<br />Harkiuso shell out the money, grinning all the while.<BR>Harkius
B000000WA2|5.0|There is a slightly sentimental nerve in this music, very strong arrangements, thoughtful and funny lyrics &quot;...he takes all manner of pills, piles up analyst bills in the countreeeeyyy...&quot;. The production is super clean, and the vocals very nonchalant, as if they really couldn't care less if they hit the high notes. I think i have heard this 100 times or more and I can't tire of it.
B000002UA0|1.0|being a huge fan of syd barrett, i found this album to be badly produced, the songs drift with no direction. just because its out there does not make it genius. <BR> i really am sorry floydians but this album is weak and sounds horrible.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is a masterful album despite some occasional weaknesses. First, let's address the problems with this disc:<br />The vast majority of songs are cover versions of songs which are not only prominently associated with the original artist, to try and re-sing them invites criticism. It's virtually impossible to improve upon anything the Beatles recorded or put your own stamp on it. Cash does a credible job with \\"In My Life\\" and certainly doesn't embarrass himself, but you still know that it can't hold a candle to Lennon's original vocal. Ditto with \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" which is so completely tied to Simon and Garfunkel that one winces if anyone else attempts to sing it. Again, Johnny does a good job on the vocal, but this is essentially filler. Why would anyone want to listen to Cash's version over the original 1970 recording?<br />The inclusion of \\"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\\" and the Eagles \\"Desperado\\" are the duel nadirs of this disc. Though Johnny sings them both with a touching world-weariness, neither song should have been included. \\"Personal Jesus\\" is another clunker.<br />Now let's examine the strengths of this record and its peculiar resonance and power:<br />The opening track is an original Cash composition and one of the outstanding songs Johnny has ever recorded, \\"When The Man Comes Around.\\" Beautifully sung and arranged, this is a creative tour de force and a song you can listen to repeatedly and still wring something from it. The little nuances Cash puts into the phrasing are memorable. A great song!<br />The next song, \\"Hurt\\" is the track which has garnered the most attention, and for good reason. Johnny's vocal is the epitome of pain, poignancy and pathos. It's reminiscent of Sinatra in the 90's, when his pipes were shot, but he still *sang* better than anyone else. This is another stellar high point in Cash's career.<br />\\"Give My Love to Rosie\\" and Sting's \\"I Hang My Head\\" are two other excellent songs, sung perfectly by Cash to convey emotion, depression and despair.<br />Amazingly, Cash's vocals on the Irish ballad, \\"Danny Boy\\" are mind-blowing. A song usually associated with singers like Bing Crosby is rendered with exquisite dignity here, in an understated and riveting arrangement.<br />Yes, this is a sobering, serious record, a thoughtful examination of death, God, life and loss. None of these songs has anything to do with \\"country music,\\" this is more a Dylanesque approach to songwriting and presenting a point of view. Another small, but imporant point, is that the cover photography and liner notes are first rate. Nothing cheesey here.<br />Johnny Cash is an American treasure, and demonstrates on this record the depth of his talent and his soul. Truly a must-have record for those interested in real music, which is so seldom recorded today.vey emotion, depression and despair.<br />Amazingly, Cash's vocals on the Irish ballad, \\"Danny Boy\\" are mind-blowing.

1559408855|1.0|I am very much in favor of uncensored art and allowing artists to realize their visions, regardless of how offensive they may be.  But, this film by Pasolini crossed a line for me.  It gave totally new meaning to the word \\"gratuitous.\\"  It was so replete with violence and depravity that it felt like a meaningless, albeit powerful, assault on my psyche.  And for what - to prove what we already know, that Mussolini's fascists were vulgar excuses for human beings?  I think films that deliver strong messages through the power of suggestion are much more effective and thought provoking than Passoini's \\"Salo.\\"  Don't get me wrong, I certainly thought a great deal about the film after seeing it, but not in an intellectually rigorous way.  My thoughts were more focused on how physically ill it made me feel.  In fact, I had real trouble sleeping for a couple of weeks after seeing it.  I don't think I need to be shocked to a point of requiring therapy in order to realize how terrible fascism can be.
B000000WGL|2.0|Richards writes pretty hooky rock music and uses the same sort of clichd lyrics that brought the Stones greatness, but Mick Jagger, he ain't. To put it another way, he can't sing. Indeed, his vocals are so tentative and mixed so badly back that it's possible to believe there is no singer (maybe this was the engineer's intention). It seems clear that without Mick there would be no Keith, on the other hand, if one listens to Jagger's solo efforts one could equally convinced that the opposite is true. Doubtless they were wise to stick together; the sum is greater than the parts.

IT JUST ALWAYS TRANSPORTS ME TO THAT KIND OF MAGICAL WORLD WHERE EXCITEMENT IS ALWAYS JUST AROUND THE CORNER!!!<BR>THE CASE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE 1ST MOVIE & AT LEAST YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP ON PLAYING WIZARD GAMES ANYMORE TO GET TO THE DELETED SCENES (19 ALL-IN-ALL --- MY FAVE IS THE ONE WHEN HARRY SEES THE MALFOYS INSIDE BORGIN & BURKES) UNLIKE THE 1ST DVD ALTHOUGH IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT, LIKE THE DVD OF THE 1ST MOVIE, YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE A DVD-ROM TO ACCESS OTHER FEATURES BUT THE ONES YOU CAN GO TO USING AN ORDINARY DVD PLAYER ARE REALLY ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU GLUED TO YOUR SCREEN FOR HOURS AS I HAVE, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT MOVIE!!!
B000020617|4.0|Foo Fighters have emerged as the quintessential hard alt band, a position they probably deserve, they certainly appeal to hoards of people (though mass appeal seems a dubious achievement for an `alternative' band, how can we be in when there is no outside?). This album finds the band at the height of its power, making catchy tunes that sound like a monster on the radio. The problem is that bands of this sort often don't stand up to repeat listening. If your in to them you'll love it, of course, and if you interested and doubting, this album WILL serve as an excellent intro. It may well be the best Foo Fighters album.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This movie is much better than the first. The actors are into the movie and are not thinking about &quot;how the heck am I in this movie&quot; anymore. The suspense and action is increadable and the special effects are amazing. It feels like I'm watching a 30min movie when I watch this. I've seen it 5 times in theatres and I am getting the DVD tomorrow 4/11/03. I recommend this movie even though over 70% of the population of Region 1 has seen it. Great movie and I can't wait to get my hands on this DVD.
B000002LQD|5.0|Always knowing the background of Lou Reed; the Velvet Underground, Andy Warhol, Glitter Rock, Dave Bowie, one of the 1st songs on the radio about sex transformations...Lou Reed was never my style (Progressive Rock, Classical, Jazz, etc...) until this fantastic, personal, profound description of losing 2 friends to cancer in the age of modern medicine. The Loss is a reference to the 2 friends, the Magic is the up & downs of taking pills & sitting through machines that try to take away the illnesses. Lou Reed writes & sings all over the map from straight rock, to folk, to ballads with such emotion & wisdom that it will bring tears to your eyes. If your like me, then don't rush out & buy other Lou Reed CD's like \\"New York\\", you will be disappointed. Lou, forget the songs about drug deals, gangsters, & sex changes...your a genius with Magic & Loss. Give us more.
B00005JL78|4.0|This DVD is a treat with the special features.<br />And not just that, &quot;Minority Report&quot; is actually quite an intelligent film, if you would ask me.  Even if this is a sci-fi action flick, it actually does make us ask, &quot;What if we could stop crime by preventing it by tapping into the psychic awareness?&quot;  <br />While Tom Cruise is not my favorite actor, he does look good in the film, that's all.  It's Colin Farrel who makes this film brilliant.  And the actress who plays the female pre-cog (the psychic) has lots of brilliant moments in this film.<br />A good film, but not one that would become a classic in years to come.
0060537639|4.0|I have enjoyed this book greatly.  I love to read books that speculate about the past including the lost civilization/ ancient cataclysm types of books.  I have to believe that many of these authors are exposing some hidden truths.  However, what is so good about Menzies book is that he actually gives better answers for many of the anomalies cited in the types of books mentioned above.  Its much more believable to follow his hypothesis that within the past millenium the Chinese visited and possibly colonized the Aztecs than it is to believe that Aztec and Olmec civilization derived from Atlantis.<br />True he does string together a lot of speculation prior to jumping to some conclusions (like the Bimini road being a ramp made to winch damaged junks ashore) but its still fun seeing if he can hold it together.  I do think that his perspective as a naval captain gives some great insights that conventional historians just don't bring to the table and of course they will vilify an amateur like him whether he is right or not, because he is jumping into their turf without the proper papers!!<br />Menzies book is very readable, he tells a good story and keeps you interested, but he also cites all evidence he can.  I'd love to spend time researching some of his \\"smoking guns\\" like the chinese junk wreck buried near San Francisco!!<br />Its a very good read...
B00003CX5P|4.0|I am an avid Star Wars fan.  I grew up on Star Wars.  I still have the original Kenner action figures and I'm not even thinking of selling them on auction websites.<br />When I heard that George Lucas was going to reprise his role as a director and work on the prequels, I was extremely excited to see how everyone got there, how Anakin Skywalker transformed into the evil Sith lord Darth Vader.<br />In \\"The Phantom Menace\\", we are introduced first to the young Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and his master Jedi, Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson).  Then we are introduced to (we all know this by now) the mother of Luke and Leia Skywalker, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) at 16 years of age. Finally, we get to meet Anakin Skywalker at 10 years of age (Jake Lloyd...could they have cast a better child actor?).  <br />A lot of people blasted \\"The Phantom Menace\\".  I have to disagree.  This is an inside look into how everyone started.  And if you are a big fan of the original trilogy, you should be able to appreciate how George Lucas tells the tale of how an innocent child is transformed into pure evil.<br />There are no real outstanding acting performances in this film, except for Natalie Portman and the outstanding fine Ewan McGregor.  It is so exciting to see how the Jedis were at this time frame because in the original trilogy, they were always discussed and during that time, I would always wonder what the Jedi were like in their prime.  Of course, we only see two of them here, but we just see how strong they are in using the force, and the treat in this film is seeing the Jedi Temple and the Jedi Council.<br />I can't wait for the third prequel to come out.  One day, when that DVD comes out, I will play all DVDs in sequence!<br />This DVD is also excellent if we're talking about special features.  And don't forget to look for the easter egg.
B00000DFMN|5.0|This was the second Art of Noise cd I bought.  Unlike most reviewers so far, I had never even heard of &quot;Moments in Love&quot; prior to purchasing this album.  ALL the songs are meaningful, and create a &quot;mood&quot;.  The first time I listened to the whole album, I was dissapointed by the whole last half.  Once I listened to it more, I got the same feeling one gets when they are attempting to interpret a painting, or any work of art for that matter.  The more I litstened, the deeper I delved, and the more I realized that The Art of Noise are musical geniuses.  Give it a chance, and you will see that this noise is really art.
6305313687|5.0|American History X is a disturbing yet realistic film that will make you think about the world we live in.  It is one of those rare films that when you finish watching it, it will just stick in your head for days.<br />This is all about hatred, and how it can really destroy our lives, when we should be enriching ours and others.  The hatred is depicted in the form of racism in this film.  As an Asian, I was deeply horrified at the violence depicted in American History X.<br />The editing of this film is superb.  We go from present to past, past to present.  If you haven't seen this film yet, I won't tell you what happens in the end.  But it does impart a very important lesson, and I will have to quote one of the characters in the film: \\"Hate ... too much baggage already...\\"<br />Edward Norton, as usual, delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Derek.  Fairuza Balk, while I would suspect that most of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, is also intense as Derek's girlfriend.  A very gripping scene here is the lunch sequence where Edward Norton's character explodes and attacks his own sister.  Beverly De Angelo's performance in this sequence is heart wrenching.<br />A lot of violence, some nudity, and a lot of foul language.  But this film is very real, because the hatred that is depicted in this film exists up to this day in many forms- homophobia, racism, etc.<br />The DVD itself has three very interesting deleted scenes.  That in itself is worth the price tag.  This is an imperative DVD to own, because it is already becomming a classic.
6305513406|5.0|I've been a fan of The Original Series since I started watching the reruns when I was about 12 years old, and having the episodes on DVD brings back a lot of memories of those days.  For one thing the episodes have been digitally remastered, resulting in a much cleaner and clearer picture that looks almost new.  The stories themselves also manage to bring back the wonder of those years, although I haven't seen them on TV in a long time.  &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; and &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; are two of my favorite episodes, so I was pretty glad when Paramount decided to release them on DVD.<br />One of the major complaints I hear about these DVDs is that they have no extras.  Not true.  Although Paramount has a reputation for putting no extras on their DVDs, each and every Original Series DVD has the original TV promos for the episodes on the DVD, plus there's an &quot;Easter egg&quot; that includes more of these promos.  While it's true that it would have been nice to have things such as cast and crew bios, it doesn't really matter to me because I enjoy the episodes for themselves, not for the extras that are on the DVD with them.<br />The other major complaint is that there's only two episodes per DVD when there could be six.  This is no big deal to me even if it is a move by Paramount to make more money, as some have said.  In fact, I feel that it makes viewing the episodes much easier because the total running time is about the same as a feature film, and if you watch only one episode, there's no going through the menu a few days later and trying to remember where you stopped at.<br />All in all, the Star Trek-The Original Series DVDs are well worth the cost, and definitely something you'll want to watch again and again.
B000000OMB|1.0|Next to ABACAB, this had to be my biggest musical disappointment, ever.  Never had I expected so much from a group of top-flight musicians (though Palmer has always been overrated - knows his rudaments, but can't keep time).  Though some may like this album on its own merits, I can't help but put it in the context it deserves, which is former Progressive guys going after crying teenage girls who have pictures of Kieth Partridge in their bedrooms.  This Album is so sickeningly sweet in some spots that its like drinking a bottle of log cabin.  The only redeeming song amongst the drivel is 'Wildest dreams', and even then, Palmer's drumming is so unimaginative and forced that it takes away from the effect of the music.  I have no problem with someone wanting to make a buck, but Tolstoy wouldn't go from writing 'War and Peace' to writing Harlequin Romances.
0684803356|3.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls, written by the well respected and one of the greatest authors of all times, Earnest Hemingway, is based on Hemingway's experience in the Spanish Civil War during 1937, when he went to cover it for the North American Newspaper Alliance. He has written many other spectacularly historic books like The Sun Also Rises, Farewell to Arms, and numerous other accounts of his real adventures covering other major historic events in American history. Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book giving off his unique style of writing. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. His description of the characters is so incredibly real, that the reader feels as though you could find their names in a history book.<BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls begins and ends in a pine-scented forest, somewhere in Spain all in sixty-eight hour period, in which he meets up with the guerilla group, falls in love with a Spanish girl named Maria, and blows up a key bridge behind enemy lines. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolition expert attached to the International Brigades lies \\"flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.\\" (1) The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: \\"I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out.\\" (85) For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. Hehas amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice.  <BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls is an excellent book, which breaks down the tragedies of war and the emotional struggles that come along with it. Hemingway is definitely the best author of his era, with a different approach to a story idea. The reading makes it hard to go through the book, but the story line keeps the reader connected with the book. I enjoyed Hemingway's unique style and hope to read more of his books with pleasure.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This CD is a breath of fresh air for me. I have never had the chance to see the multi talented Alison Krauss and Union Station Featuring Jerry Douglas. For fans like me, it is a CD that stays in my CD player ALL the time. All of AKUS' wonderful hits are all on this cd. This is a MUST HAVE for any AKUS fan.
6303402348|5.0|Before I begin, I'd like to address the negative reviews given to this movie. I've read quite a few of them, but none of them have had me change or even consider changing my opinion. Most were written by people with issues. Whether it be the presidential jokes, their lack of appreciation for the special effects or Tom Hank's &quot;poor&quot; portrayal of a mental challenged man. Yet, most of them complain about the film's lack of realism. How all of these events from the 70's to present day could ever possibly happen to one man. <br />These people have yet to discover the magic of (and not to mention, the biggest reason for) movie making. Why does reality matter? The point of capturing the life of a man who lived through so many trivial events is because no one real person could possibly ever achieve it. And by sitting in your seat and joining him in his tears and laughter only lightens your heart, as this movie was meant to do. Those who can say that this movie almost made them vomit, have a lot of nerve and very little understanding for \\"art\\". <br />The movie is about a man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) who is born to his mother (Sally Field) with a &quot;below normal&quot; IQ of 75. To add to his challenges in life, his crooked back burdens him to wear braces on his legs. While running away from bullies at the advice of his #1 girl Jenny (&quot;Run Forrest, run!&quot;), they break off revealing his ability to run like the wind.<br />This ability lands him playing football, which lands him a scholarship to college, which leads him to the army where he learns to play ping pong and meets his best friend, Bubba, who teaches him all about shrimp. Place Forrest at a bus stop with a box of chocolates telling his whole story, and you have magic. <BR>This is one of my top 10 films by far. It is the true full body experience. It makes me cry and laugh. The all star cast is one of the film's best points. Taking you through and unforgettable and dream-like journey. What a film.
B000002VMH|5.0|This really is an amazing album.  Lennox pulls out all the stops here and creates an album of music so lush and beautiful that I dare anybody who listens to it to not be hypnotized. From hearbreaking ballads to bluesy pop/rock Annie wraps her voice around each like she is releasing little bits of herself into the air.  It is impossible to find a debut album that not only will never leave you collection, but will also never leave your head.
B000003TAW|5.0|this album started it all.  It came out with all of the grunge rock niravana types were popular and was able to make more than a name for itself its catchy upbeat lyrics and solid rythm.  Its an album that trancends time.  When we are old we will sit kids on our knees and say, yes son, I was alive when weezer was around.  With out a doubt this is the greatest album of the 90s.  You see the heavy metal kids, rap kids, country kids, they all love weezer, how can you not?  This album is the type of thing that brings the world a little closer to world peace... buy it.

0486282147|3.0|I read this novel after an almost chronological reading in the Sherlock Holmes's novels and short stories.<br />I certainly started with \\"a study in scarlet\\" which was fine, then went to \\"the sign of four\\" which was even finer. These two novels where enough to get me hooked on the world of Doyle's Holmes. Then to make things even better, I read the \\"adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" a collection of short stories, which were excellent, followed by \\"the memoir of Sherlock Holmes\\" which was on the same lines as the adventures, but Sherlock Holmes was finally killed by Moriarty in the last short story of the collection. I was not afraid, because the remaining pages of the collection of stories I had was still thick, so I knew something was going to happen. Sure enough, Sherlock Holmes was resurrected in the next collection (not before \\"the hound of Baskervilles\\", although it is traditionally given before it in the complete works) which was called \\"the return of Sherlock Holmes.\\" Up to this point I was a big fan of Holmes, but this story: \\"the hound of Baskervilles,\\" came to destroy everything.<br />The first aspect I hated about it, was that it wasn't a mystery. It was a quest behind the villain, who was knowen by the middle of the story ... and no wonder, for Doyle wrote this after the acclaimed death of Holmes. He was not ready yet to bring back his detective, and he was actually going to write this story with different characters, until he was struck by Holmes as an already existing character of his, and that he needn't waste his time creating some new character line.<br />The story is not totally bad, but the idea of having Holmes in a non mystery novel did not strike me as plausible.<br />I recommend you to read it. It seems, from the review, that I was the only one not to like it, but I can't control that. What I do not like is what I do not like, and I hope you found something useful in this review.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen. Since war in Iraq has broke out I've been watching a lot of war movies and this one by far is the most brutal, intense, realistic, horrifying of all of them. This movie really makes you appreciate the troops and all they sacrifice for their country. Lately the cable news channel have been treating war like a big video game and acting very childish. This movie puts everything into perspective and makes you understand what truly is important. So instead of watching FOX News and their stupid cat fights with MSNBC put this movie on.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|This sounds just like their last two.  They aren't breaking any new ground with this mindless noise.  I don't see what they have to be angry about.  For real aggressive music listen to oi! Bands like Condemned 84, the 4-Skins, Templars.  Pure street aggro.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack is doing what Disturbed and Mudvayne have done and what Linkin Park should have done: evolved.

0783225970|5.0|Well, it looks like Universal Pictures gave us one of those 50/50 DVDs. The extras on this single-disc \\"Collector's Edition\\" are very satisfying for the Scarface fans, but the transfer makes the movie look dirty when it's not supposed to be.<br />This happens to be a movie that leans towards a sense of style; that 1980s feel is accompanied by a very fitful and pulsating soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder. Most of the sequences in Scarface look high-class because of Tony's wealthy lifestyle, so cleaning up the film of its fuzziness & dirt would give it an even more realistic feel. I mean, imagine watching those scenes in The Babylon Club remastered both in picture and sound for that absorbing experience! It would really make watching the movie into a happening, which is all the better. Also, look at how grainy some other scenes are: \\"You made a deal for a ... 18 million dollars without checking with me? Are you crazy, Montana? Are you crazy?!\\" That scene appears to be the most grainy-filmed sequence in the film, and with this DVD transfer, it appears TWICE as grainy. Is that necessary?<br />I can see why most people are ticked off with this \\"Collector's Edition\\"...if this DVD edition of Scarface REALLY is a collector, then that would mean ruling out all other versions known since its release, because this one IS a \\"Collector's Edition\\".<br />In my opinion, the movie is classic! But as for the DVD, the only thing that makes it a collector's item is the excellent supplemental material.<br />The movie: *****<BR>The extras: ****<BR>The transfer: Imagine trying to break through a three-layered concrete wall with your head.
1881273156|5.0|Man alive, this book should be required reading in High School. Definatley before one takes that big step into marriage. It all makes sense now. This is why sometimes taking out the trash without bieng asked can show certian people that you do love them... and why holding hands and cuddling might be just as important to others.... Do yourself a favour, read this book with someone you love. Then you will know how to keep their \\"love\\" tank filled up and they'll know what you need to fill yours!
0131103628|5.0|K&amp;R C is easily the best book on C ever written. It is certainly the best programming language book, perhaps even the best educational resource, I've ever come across. I feel pained when people say it is not good for learning C, or too difficult etc. I have found it great (not just good mind you) for both learning and reference, and continue to believe that if you cant learn C from K&amp;R C, then perhaps programming is not your cup of tea. <br />The greatest traits of this book are conciseness and yet, a remarkable thoroughness. It is also amazing how quickly one can find a solution to a problem... even the index is concise yet thorough. It is also written like an educational book should be written... humbly and objectively. K&amp;R C is a classic not only for its educational value, but also for the beauty of its writing. This is a must-have for any programmer worth their salt.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|There are bands who's hits are medicore and they get slapped into some over hyped package. Not here, Blondie is a band that towers among the elite of rock. In fact Blondie are the elite in rock, In my estimation, Blondie are one of rocks Top 5 Best Artists of all time, hands down. In this Greatest Hits collection, you get no less than 4 American #1 Singles and 6 British # 1 Singles. There are very few artists that can claim this type of success. Deborah Harry is true rock Icon, the vision and originality that Blondie have is remarkable.<br />In the summer of 1979, Blondie owned the world charts, selling some 20 million copies of \\"Parallel Lines\\", topping the Charts with songs like \\"Heart of Glass, Dreaming and Sunday Girl\\", Blondie was the #1 Band in the world, a feat they carried over into 1980, when there Hit \\"Call Me\\" was the #1 Song of the Year in America. Call Me from the movie \\"AMERICAN GIGOLO\\" Soundtrack defined the 1980's Me Me Me decade of want, sexy and over indulgence. Blondie were once again on the pulse of POP CULTURE.  Blondie introduced RAP & REGGAE to multiple millions of people in 79-81. Rap was then a very much under ground music style just starting to get a little notice, when Blondie released \\"Rapture\\" the #1 single released in 1980 on the album \\"AutoAmerican\\". With \\"Rapture\\" exploding to the Top of The Charts, the door was wide open for Rap. Just weeks before \\"Rapture hit #1, Blondie had their 3rd #1 single in America with \\"The Tide is high\\". The mass success of these 2 songs, gave the world their first taste of Rap and Reggae.<br />Blondie always strived to create the perfect \\"POP\\" song, they were orginal, creative and always cutting edge. Deborah Harry's voice is probally the most familiar in rock music, there is no mistaking her vocals. On this Greatest Hits collection you get the light hearted reggae gem \\"The Tide is High\\" #1US #1 UK, the driving beat of \\"Dreaming\\" #24US #2UK, you get the sexy and sweet summer hit of \\"Sunday Girl\\" #1UK, theabsolutely magical bi-lingual Euro Smash \\"Denis\\" #2UK. Now we get to the MEGA HITS, the THROBBING TECHNO BEATS of \\"Heart of Glass and Call Me\\" both #1US #1UK. These 2 hits still influence artists in 2003, Call Me and Heart of Glass remain 2 of Rock Music's Top 100 songs all time, not too mention 'Rapture\\".<br />Deborah Harry is sexy and just so hypnotic on songs like \\"Atomic\\" #1US DANCE #37US #1UK, and the New Wave high energy power house of \\"One way or Another\\" #27US (featured in Coyote Ugly), also a very well known \\"Sports Anthem\\". Blondie was the FIRST ARTIST EVER, to release a full length Video album, for their 1979 album \\"Eat to the Beat\\". Blondie again proving their creative force in rock, this is just another milestone in rock that has made Blondie such an incredible and ground breaking band. The videos from that release have been put onto the accompanying \\"Greatest Video Hits\\".  This Greatest hits CD is an absolute buy, a must have for any rock fan's collection. The Blondie sound is as fresh and vibrant, as they date it was originally released.
B00005JKDR|4.0|The people at Pixar have a remarkable talent for taking an idea from childhood, turning it into a compelling story, and producing a film that is enjoyable to both children and adults.  Oh, and they tend to look fantastic, too.  In the latest feature-length film from Pixar, we learn that monsters really do live in our closets.  In particular, we get to know Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) as two monsters who work for a scream-collecting factory called Monsters, Inc.<br />The premise of the film is that the world of the monsters is powered by the screams of children.  So the employees of Monsters, Inc. are responsible for sneaking into the rooms of children while they are sleeping to scare them.  The emanating screams are captured into containers where they are refined into the highest quality screams to power everything from the lights to the cars.  Because their screams are such a powerful substance, children are considered toxic and dangerous.  So trouble ensues when a child follows Sully into the monsters' world.<br />Although the premise may sound a bit frightening for children, the filmmakers handle the concept well and there are only a few scenes where children may be initially startled.  But the film quickly changes moods during these scenes and children will come out laughing.<br />The vocal talents of John Goodman and Billy Crystal fit their characters well, and the performances of Steve Buscemi (as Randall) and James Coburn (as Henry J. Waternoose III) are also excellent.  As the expanded material on the DVD points out often, the animation is definitely ground-breaking as many of the monsters (especially Sully) are rendered gorgeously with fur that flows and bounces with the movement of the characters.  This is the first Pixar film that was not directed by John Lasseter (responsible for directing the _Toy Story_ films and _A Bug's Life_, and serves as executive producer for _Monsters, Inc._), but Pete Docter does a great job taking the helm of this Oscar-nominated film (that lost to Shrek -- whatever).<br />The DVD release includes a second disc which includes a great tour of the production process of the film, such as early story treatments and detailed explanations of why modeling fur is so darn hard.  One of the best features of the second disc is the very funny animated short film &quot;For the Birds&quot; which won an Oscar for &quot;Best Animated Short Film,&quot; as well as the humorous but slightly disappointing &quot;Mike's New Car.&quot;<br />Like other Pixar films, the story and characters are entertaining and engaging for young viewers.  But the film includes character complexity and subtle humor that adults will appreciate as well.  While not quite up to the standards of _Toy Story_ or its sequel, _Toy Story 2_, this remains a terrific film.
B00005JLT5|3.0|Well made movie alright, but we have seen countless depictions of war time Nazi domination. I expected from the title that \\"The Pianist\\" would mean something about the struggle of a pianist to save his people or to contribute to war, or to use his musical capabilities to escape or something! But this is JUST ANOTHER ESCAPE movie! <br />I mean, it could easily have been \\"The Barber\\" and how he saved his life and in the end gave a fabulous haircut to a good samaritan German general and everything could still be oh so touchy touchy. <br />I just dont get it. Anyway, good movie worth watching but it is a war movie afterall...with all the cliches of war (like Nazis being real rude and stuff).
B00008DDSC|5.0|Fascinating and insightful look into today's ofice society.  I must admit, if I had my own personal secretary, I would be tempted to explore this fantasy on a personal level.<br />The main risk of sexual harassment comes from federal laws sponsored by particular civil liberties groups or the crude power-sharing proposals currently being considered by corporate America, which threaten to entrench ethnic or religious differences as well as sexual preference. <br />The most important step towards the further development of a common workplace behavior would be the instigation of a corporate summit that involved all levels of workplace authority.   For the subordinates, crucially, that would hold out the promise not just of retaining real autonomy but also gaining fair participation in setting the standards for workplace morality.
B000088E6D|5.0|I have to say that I was very impressed and surprised at the caliber of this young man's voice.  For a lad so young he has the sound of someone who has been singing for a decade.  He brings to life each and every song with his own special touch.  I feel that he is at the beginning of a wonderful and long career.  I will be looking forward to anything that this artist puts out.  I only hope that he stays with this wonderful style of music and brings us another c.d. as wonderful of this one
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Some people might think that tATu is Russia's answer to Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera.  They're completely wrong.  tATu's music is so hopelessly addictive that you can't get the songs out of your head, and they're actually GOOD.<br />The first track \\"Never Gonna Get Us\\" starts with a funky dance/trance beat, and even though the singer's voice is a bit shrill at the beginning of the song, the whole thing just grooves with energy later on.  The next track \\"All The Things She Said\\" is, in my opinion, the strongest piece on the CD.  Other great songs include \\"Clowns\\" and \\"Gay Boy.\\"<br />The only reasons I'm giving it four out of five stars is because the videos included on the CD are much too dark to view on a computer screen, and because the CD is short, about 40 minutes if you don't include the remix.  But hey, this is one fantastic piece of music!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Before I was introduced to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot I'd never heard of Wilco. Because of this CD im hooked on Wilco. This CD is increadibly amazing, its so awesome. It's a different experience all together. This is a must have CD for anyone's collection. Gonna be in my top 10 forever.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Have you ever taken your five favorite words of the day and expressed how imporantant each of them are to your individual vocabulary? I cannot stress enough how refreshing this and all other Smashing Pumpkins albums are. I own each and every one. Siamese Dreams one of my personal favorites. Pre-Goth. Though I change for the seasons. It is the one of the most beautiful collections I ever have the pleasure of coveting, and will cherish it until the end of time.
B000002NHN|5.0|This was the first Loreena CD I got, after hearing &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; on the radio.  With each subsequent listen over the course of the last several years, I find myself loving this disc more and more.  The music has more of a Middle-Eastern texture than most of her earlier work, and the sound quality is, in my opinion better as well, allowing the listener to hear Loreena's glorious voice like never before.<br />1.) Prologue is a piece that beautifully sets the mood for this dramatic set.  Mostly instrumental, with some of Loreena's lovely vocalizations.<br />2.) The Mummer's Dance is why I, and so many others, bought this in the first place.  The instrumentals are great (especially the fiddle when she sings how &quot;sounds of birds seem to fill the woods when the fiddler plays&quot;), and the lyrics are fun and catchy.  That said, this track is no longer by any means my favorite on here.  It was, for the most part, the hook that reeled my in.<br />3.) Skellig is a quiet piece...in fact, a little too quiet for my taste, but perfect for relaxing or meditating or getting a massage.<br />4.) Marco Polo...now that's more like it.  An Eastern-flavored dance beat that makes you want to go and take bellydancing lessons.  The drums in here are my favorites.  This is basically another instrumental that features wordless vocalizations from Loreena.<br />5.) Highwayman--well, there are really no words for the beauty of this song.  Based on Tennyson's poem, with haunting instrumentals, this ballad will have you on the edge of your seat, even if you've heard it before and KNOW the ending.  Try not to start biting your fingernails when she sings &quot;Tot-a-lot, tot-a-lot, had they heard it, the horse's hooves rang clear...&quot;<br />6.) A lovely, sweet song, in the same line as Skellig.  Moody and lush.  Great for a rainy evening at home.<br />7.) Night Ride Across the Caucasus is not only my favorite song on this album, it is my favorite Loreena McKennitt song andone of my favorite songs of all time.  It is a dark song about traveling at night that makes you feel like you are driving through the desert or the mountains.  (For any and all interested, this was the song that was played in the movie Soldier, and it is NOT on that soundtrack.)<br />8.) Dante's Prayer is one of the most haunting love songs I've ever heard.  Based, of course, on the Divine Comedy, this song is pure poetry, with lines like &quot;when the dark night seems endless, please remember me.&quot;<br />The liner notes in this album are also great...like The Mask and the Mirror, they form a sort of diary of Loreena's travels, and show what influenced the writing of these gorgeous songs.<br />People, if I could give this more than five stars, I would.
B000089A07|4.0|While Manhunter was Hollywood's idea of a good adaptation, it has to stand alone as a movie separate from Red Dragon.  'Dragon' has the elements of the book that Manhunter did not.  It gives more insight into the Lecter character and how he got to be known as 'Hannibal the Cannibal' and pays more attention to Francis Dolarhyde - as a character.  However, casting Ralph Fiennes as the tall, unattractive-to-geeky Dolarhyde was a huge mistake.  Just not credible and not enough detail was given to the entire Dolarhyde character to explain his nickname \\"The Tooth Fairy\\".  <br />Manhunter was brilliant, it was cunning, it was clever and calculated and the performances were excellent.  But I really had to look at these two movies as totally different movies.  Edward Norton was great, I have no idea what they did to the delicate wilting female character from the book.<br />And of course, there has to be a Director's Edition which has two discs and contains material not in [other] versions...<br />Each film should be judged on it's own merits rather than compared to the other.  Much more enjoyable that way.
B00006RINF|5.0|I first got into Lacuna Coil when i found out they were going to be touring here with Moonspell. So i downloaded two full cds and ep's being that it was very hard to find their cd's in the US.I was so amazed how great they were and how could i have not known about this band sooner. But when i seen them play live in philadelphia,i was blown away by the force and power of Lacuna Coil. So i had to see them in New York and i have been a big fan ever since. When i first heard Comalies it was from Mp3's on the internet until i picked up an import copy of it. I also own it on Vinyl. Their production is suberb and Comalies is just one of the best cds. I'm shocked this band isn't bigger in my opinion.<BR>They are touring the US very soon with Opeth if not by the time this review is posted. I highly recommend everyone pick up this cd and just enjoy the beauty and power of Comalies! Then pick up their other cds too. Great Band! Lacuna Coil is a band to look out for. Five Star cd from a Five Star Band!
B0000029GA|5.0|Man, I slept on this for too long(And I call myself a true hip-hop fan).  One day I'm watchin ol' school wednesday on rapcity(too bad it don't come on anymore), then I saw Nas' video, it ain't hard to tell.  It was tight, and his lyrical flow is perhaps the illest of all time(alongside Rakim).  Then I decided to buy it.  The CD was so gosh-darn short only nine tracks(1st ones a intro)  But the beats are bangin, and His flow is so ill, that just ads on to the value of the CD, HIGHLY<br />1.Genisis:Just a intro, like usual<br />2.NY state of mind:This is my favorite track off the whole thing, tight beat, and and nice story told about the way of NY 10/10<br />3.Life's a...:The only guest aperence on the CD, AZ, nice slow beat, and from time to time, u wanna agree with them 9/10<br />4.The world is yours:Another dope beat, and Nas raining down Ill lyrics like a blessing from the heavens above 10/10<br />5.Halftime:Bassy beat, the loudest on the whole CD, this must have been the intermission for the halfway mark.  Tight 10/10<br />6.Memory Lane:Nice going slow beat, and the poet once again blesses the mic with a nice story with ill lyrics 9/10<br />7.One love:bangin beat, and shouting out to all those in jail 10.10<br />8.One time for ya mind:More of a freesyly, but with nice beat, and the right paced lyrics for the song(as always) 10/10<br />9.Represent:The beat was aite, but the flow keeps from getting lower 8/10<br />10.It ain't hard to tell:2nd best, Hardcore beat, and some ill lyrics too(Well that wasn't hard to tell) 10/10<br />This arguably the greatest rap album ever made.  It woulda been real nice if he put NY state of mind out for a hit.  After listening to this, and all the other NAs albums,  I can't help but think, what happend to Nas.  I mean sure rappers get older, but the GZA still got a tight flow.  Well Nas went back to his roots on illmatic(Thank God)  God's sone was alright, but nothing really special.  Out of all the music ever made, this will, undoubtingly, go down as one of the greatest albums of all time.one of the greatest albums of all time.
B000066NW0|4.0|For too long the music industry has been flooded by Boy and Girl bands with only two things going for them. They can just about hold a note and they look good. Avril Lavigne, thankfully, bucks this trend. She is also talented. While many of her peers are stage managed and made up, Lavigne writes and performs songs of such talent that the music does the talking and the publicists are redundant. The confessional style lyrics of I'm  With You are complimented by the pop/punk style of Sk8er Boy. This Album is a stunning Debut that defys her years. Lavigne's style covers so many boundaries that comparisions with the like of Alanis Morrisette and Pink are nothing more than a waste of words. It has been a long time since a debut album with the range of Let Go has reached the mainstream
B000089A07|4.0|Having seen the Michael Mann version of Red Dragon (Manhunter) and this new version I have to agree that the Mann version was better.  The whole feel of the Mann movie is much better. Mann was still in his Miami Vice best when he shot Manhunter and it shows.  Manhunters' visuals are much more compelling Film Noir.  And the Hannibal Lecter trio is Film Noir  at its' best. Ed Norton `s performance is lest angst ridden and flatter than William Peterson but still believable. It is more a matter of taste than one being the better than the other. Tom Noonan Dolarhyde was much more sinister than Ralph Fiennes as Noonan played Dolarhyde flatter and more mechanically than Fiennes.<br />Noonan's Dolarhyde was a cool unemotional killer. Fiennes' Dolarhyde is much more possessed and guilt ridden.  As for the battle of the Hannibals, I can't fault either performance of Brian Cox or Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is classically trained and gives Hannibal all the depth of a Shakespearian hero (or villain) but Cox is no slouch as Lecture either. Cox's Hannibal is every bit the suave and debonair killer that Hopkins' is.  I happen to like Hopkins as an actor because of the performances he has given in other movies.  I haven't seen any of Mr. Cox's efforts so it's hard to say he is better actor than Hopkins.  Again, it's a matter of taste.<br />As much as I like Hopkins turn as Hannibal I can't recommend purchasing this DVD over Manhunter.  I do recommend getting both of these movies as they compliment each other well.  I do prefer the Mann ending to the Brett Ratner's. The Ratner ending is much to \\"Perils of Pauline\\" for me.  The Mann ending plays more like something out of fevered dream (especially with the Iron Butterfly playing in the background to accompany all the mayhem on screen.) while Ratner is much more paint-by-numbers and conventional.
B000002LOE|4.0|The only true highlights on this album are &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; and &quot;Texarcana.&quot; Although &quot;Belong&quot; and &quot;Country Feedback&quot; do have some potential to be good, they just aren't that great.<br />As for the rest of the album...I think that it's too much pop. &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;...good, but not what a typical r.e.m song should be like. And believe me, r.e.m. has a huge range of songs. I think that maybe that girl from the go-go's chipped in made it bad, as well as w/ a few backing vocals from &quot;Me In Honey&quot;....but that's just me. &quot;Radio Song&quot; is everything it says it is...a radio song. Sometimes, unfortunately, it can be played too much and just sounds like mush, which is what happened to this song. &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot; and &quot;Half a World Away&quot; are ok...and it's sad that is it...just ok. &quot;Low&quot; is too long for what it has to offer, and &quot;Endgame&quot; is just an instrumental which isn't near as good as &quot;New Orleans&quot; on AFTP. <br />Although, this may be r.e.m's weakest l.p. it's still a classic. I still listen to it all the way through when I just want to hear some r.e.m. On a more positive not, Out of Time is actually relaxing to listen to. Makes you feel somewhat happy after listening to it all. Although the songs aren't the best, I still enjoy the album as a whole. Just couldn't give it the 5 stars b/c lack of substance.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|Eminem puts out another tight cd with the 8 Mile Soundtrack. Some of rap music's biggest names are compiled onto this album such as Jay-Z, Freeway, Xzibit, 50 Cent, Obie Trice, Gangstarr, and many others. Best songs are:<BR>Lose Yourself (Oscar Winner for Best Original Song)<BR>Love Me<BR>8 Mile<BR>Rap Game<BR>8 Miles and Runnin'<BR>Wanksta<BR>That's My N**** Fo' Real<BR>Battle<BR>Rabbit Run<br />The two best songs on the soundtrack are on the bonus disc called \\"Rap Name\\" by Obie Trice, and \\"Stimulate\\" by Eminem. There is also a freestyle by 50 Cent that is worth a listen. <BR>If you do not already have this album, buy this NOW!!!!
B00008I8IF|4.0|If you're a fan, or even just a casual listener of the Jayhawks, you'll find this disc engaging from beginning to end. Beautiful harmonies, and music that leaves you floating thru the notes. Stand out tracks: All The Right Reasons, Save It For A Rainy Day, Eyes Of Sarahjane, Angelyne and Tampa To Tulsa. The bonus disc that comes with the first pressings is a nice keepsake for the rabid fan, but don't trip over yourself to find it, demos and live tracks are interesting but not a must.
B000063DHL|5.0|Definetly one of Iron Maiden's best albuns, if not the best one! For those used to heavier stuff, it may seem kind childish but it Maiden's truly is the cream of Heavy Metal and &quot;Somewhere in time&quot; is the cream os Iron's work. Listen to &quot;Somewhere in time&quot;, &quot;Sea of Madness&quot; and &quot;Alexander the great&quot; and you'll soon see what I mean. &quot;Wasted years&quot; was a bit too much played but is still a good track anyway. Finally, &quot;Somewhere in time&quot; is an essencial item for those who claim to enjoy pure Heavy Metal and Maiden's fans.
B000088E6P|5.0|THIS CD IS GREAT!!! BUT PLEASE AND I REPEAT PLEASE IF UR GONNA GET THIS CD DONT GET THE CLEAN VERSION ITS JUST NOT THE SAME CD. I LOVE THE CD AND 50'S THE MAN. ALL THE TRACKS ARE GREAT AND I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO NE 1 BUY THIS CD!! (BUT GET THE EXPLICIT VERSION!)
B00008J4P5|1.0|This band is simply played.Same junk you hear over and over again. This band is all over the radio. If you've heard the stripes before, you've already heard elephant.
0316666343|5.0|After being raped and murdered, a young girl watches from heaven as her family falls apart as they cannot cope with her death and unsolved murder. <BR>I would recommend reading it twice as it makes you think about what happens to you after you die and the affect it has on your loved ones after you are gone ... and \\"to you\\". <BR>Heart-breaking and life-affirming, I wept when her dog joined her and when her family fell apart and re-joined up in their own individual way, I recommended this book to most women I knew who were having any kind of family problem.
B00008O31H|5.0|I was lucky enough to get my hands on this one 6 weeks before it came out so I have already played it to death. My first feeling was that it didn't compare to \\"The big come up\\" but after many more listenings I now feel it is as good with just as much soul as the first. These guys are doing what no other bands are right now, going back to the basics and playing with incredible amounts of soul and feeling. The highlights in my opinion are \\"Set you Free\\" \\" Midnight\\" and \\"I cry alone\\" although I think the entire album is good. I was also lucky enough meet them at the Metro in Chicago and they are the most down to earth nicest guys you'll ever meet.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's album &quot;Meteora&quot; is probably the best album I have bought in a long time. Although it is a pretty short album (in comparison to &quot;Reanimation&quot;) this band has packed a lot of power into 36 minutes. I think this album totally proves the maturity of this band musically. Chester has this amazingly powerful voice which really shines on songs like &quot;Lying From You&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;Don't Stay&quot; etc. I loved this album and I think this band has come a long way since the release of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;.  This album is amazing, and the lyrics are really powerful.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This album keeps rocking for the minute you put it in until you close out with the last track.  If you LOVED the first two Albums this is a must have to add to you collection!!!
B000059XYL|3.0|Although the cast list is comprised of mostly females, there are many aspects that allow `Coyote Ugly' to reveal itself as more than just another \\"chick flick\\".  The sex appeal that the movie possesses is reminiscent of a `Girls Gone Wild' video; but with a PG-13 twist.  Had the film been pushed to R, it's hard to say if it would've received more or less attention.  The women never really reveal anything.  And for the most part that's okay.  But as another reviewer noted, there is not enough Tyra Banks.  She's on the cover, in the movie for about 15 minutes, and then gone.  I guess in the end it doesn't really matter; but still, they shouldn't lead the viewer on.  When it comes to the actual storyline, a lot can (or cannot) be said.  If you're a male, the plot probably won`t affect you.  However, the female audience will surely be intrigued by the character of Jersey (first-timer Piper Perabo).<br />The plot is based on that character; who is lost in life and needs something to help boost her music career.  She obviously has talent, but two things drag her down.  One... her father (John Goodman) doesn't want her to leave because he'd then have no one to wash his cloths.  Two... she has an enormous fear of being on stage.  With that being said, the movie just goes off those two aspects.  Jersey does find a job, but it's not your average profession.  The job title is said to be a bartender, but it could be explained as a singer/bartender/stripper/dancer.  As it's old hat with Jerry Bruckheimer films, it does a great job with the in-your-face sequences.  When the woman are dancing on the bar to oldies (or whatever), the camera work shoots back and forth very nicely.  And even though this movie seems like a `Charlie's Angles' without the action, it gives you a real charge.  Finding a bar like this is as far-fetched as the ending to `Armageddon' was (okay, not really).  It seems like the kind of bar people'd dream about.  Since I don't like to ruin movies for people, I will stop here.  There are a lot of interesting parts in this movie.  There's some good comedy; mostly courtesy of John Goodman.  I particularly enjoyed when someone honks their horn at him when he`s working.  I won't spoil that for you either.  But the acting by Perabo is rather average, but can be condoled since it's here first major role.  The role of Kevin (Adam Garcia) will certainly be enjoyable for the females, since he brings his own type of male sex appeal to the movie.  And the appearances by funnymen Johnny Knoxville and Chris Wylde are genuinely good cameos; though not as good as LeAnn Rimes playing herself.  The characters of most of the bartenders are not well-covered, but I think it was intended to be that way.  And the fact that Zoe (Tyra Banks) left to become a lawyer is smart; as it shows the women are not just brainless, low I.Q. bartenders.  Still, although most of the movie's aspects are covered, some of them are not covered too well.<br />Whether you're a boy or a girl, there's great chance you'll enjoy `Coyote Ugly'.  If you like the female-fronted movies then there's no question you'll like this one.  If you're a male, and you're looking for hot, sensual movies with endless spraying of beer and close-to/would-be strippers, you'll probably enjoy it too.  I gave the movie 3 stars; I enjoyed it a lot, but as I've hinted to, was a little disappointed with it as a whole.  I give Bruckheimer and co. credit for doing a movie like this, though I don't feel it is quite as good as his other \\"action\\" movies.  This film is not a let-down because of its PG-13 rating, and it's certainly not just a \\"chick flick\\".  I do recommend this, but know what you like first.ill stop here.

B00008H2LB|5.0|After a really big disapointment with the reanamtions I have to say that Meterora is by far one of the best new albums of the year to date. Anyone that complains about the length of the album being only 37mins I have news for you, THEY DID MORE IN THAT 37 MINS THAN MOST BAND DO IN THE ENTIRE ALBUM MAKING LIFE!! If you want more, listen to it again!
0380002930|2.0|Having heard many opinions that this is a \\"great story,\\" a \\"classic epic,\\" and a \\"thrilling adventure,\\" I had to read it for myself--and boy, was I let down.  Here's why.<br />1. The book is contrived--not a seamless integration of parts and whole, but a series of raw, abortive events hammered into the mould of an epic.<br />2. The book is predictable. If you were an alien from another planet, who had never read a human-authored story before, you might approve. But, being someone who has actually lived on the planet for a little while, I can confidently say that there is almost no originality here.<br />3. The rabbit gimmick falls flat. The idea of substituting rabbits for humans seems to have exhausted the author, and he seems to think his gimmick of dressing up a bad story in rabbit fur is enough originality for one book. It's not.<br />4. I don't care about the characters. The rabbits' characters are never developed enough to make me want to care. They're two-dimensional, simple, predictable, cookie-cutter, and, like a coloring book, the author always stays within the lines (yaaaaawn).<br />5. This book is too long. Cheers to the author's work-ethic for dragging this out to fit the \\"epic\\" genre. Jeers to the author's aesthetic sense for not recognizing that his rabbit tale is not strong enough to be an epic.<br />On the plus side: having read the book, everytime I see a rabbit, I get an uncanny sense that I've visited their world. Adams does have a way of emulating the tiny minds of rabbits.  But then, why would you want to cram your human intelligence into the mind of a rabbit, anyway? It's like trying to force yourself inside a mailbox--it may be exciting at first, but then it just gets silly and painful.
B00000IL29|5.0|This collection with Herbie Hancock fronting a group consisting of the rhythm section of Miles Davis' second quintet; the always amazing Tony Williams and Ron Carter;  is an absolute classic from the period. Freddie Hubbard is at times astonishing in his soloing. George Coleman who also did a brief stint with Davis rounds out the group on tenor. While not one of my favorite tenor players overall he does some of his best recorded work on this. Hancock established himself as a composer of jazz standards with Maiden Voyage. His playing on this is comparable to another classic of the period Miles Smiles. Maiden Voyage ,Miles Smiles and Wayne Shorter's Speak No Evil are the epitome of where modal jazz was headed in the 60's under the influence of Miles Davis. These fabulous musicians were making history again and again.
B00008I8IF|3.0|I just got thru listening to Rainy Day Music and I have to say I'm disappointed.  But, in all honesty, their last few releases have disappointed me.  The true Jayhawks can be heard on the first three or four albums.  When Mark Olson left, what was left was a shadow of the old band.  These guys need to release a live album.  I have a few bootlegs of the band...and they are hot live.  A lot hotter than they are on this effort.  Bring back Mark Olson.  Just do a live gig or two with Mark and record it!  We true Jayhawks fans want it!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out in September, and it is still my favorite CD 3 months later. There is something about this CD that takes you back in time. You feel like you are walking the streets of New York in 1979 when glam and fast, loud rock was all the rage. Lets just say you need to buy this CD as soon as possible. This is only their first Cd and The Strokes are going to only get better
0316666343|2.0|I, like a lot of other people, got caught up in the hype of this book and assumed it was going to be fantastic.  This book was such a disappointment.<br />The book is about a young girl who is raped and murdered by a neighbour.  The story is told from her perspective after she dies.  She is able to watch her family go on living without her.  I guess I just expected better.

B000089RVX|5.0|So this is it!!!!! Some new pop superstars are born, (because this has nothing to do with goth metal, this is pop rock with a goth metal attitude.) and this time they actually make good music....They claim that Danny Elfman is their biggest influence and that can be felt.......<BR>When all that is said, this has to be the best thing the music industry has produced since Bjorks \\"Homogenic\\" and that was six years ago............<br />Every single song has hit potential...and I mean EVERY SINGLE SONG <BR>And as for Amy's voice take the best of Sarah Mclachlan and Shakira then mix it together and add some powerfull emotions............... there you have it.........
B000002UDB|5.0|An &quot;album&quot; from my youth! Awesome!
B00006RINF|4.0|First of all - I'm not a metal head. I don't even care for metal that much.....so why have I given this album 4 stars and not 1? Well, I guess the answer is that I don't really consider this to be in the metal category (at least not in my book, where metal is all about growling how you hate everything, exept human flesh ofcourse) it's far too high spirited and optimistic. I guess that's partly due to the etheral and uplifting female vocals, but also the music leaves a positive vibe. <BR>Now I'm not saying this is soft or anything it's definitly rock it's also hard rock, but thats ok I like headbanging once in a while .................................................................Initially I had some problems with the male vox, but it now seems to have settled. He still should have kept silent on the last track though.......<br />Like many others I bought this album because I fell in love with Evanescence, and wanted somthing similar. Well this is similar although not as catchy, but really what is???<br />One last thought.....Why do the band members have to look like absolute geeks in their \\"stepping out of some Anne Rice book\\" costumes?....that is for the exeption of the lead singer Christina, for some strange reason it seems to fit her quite well......<br />Best songs: the first three....
B000002UB6|4.0|The last Beatles album. So sad to see them go. Any Beatles fan knows , though,that this was primarily Paul's and George Martin's production. For that reason, I never bought it. I only bought it now after so many years to have John's Across the Universe. Anyway, if you are a die-hard fan you'll need to get it.
B000000OMB|5.0|Wow!  They did it together! The power of four musicians has showed us that music is teamwork. My heart will sing every time when I listen to this album. &quot;The Heat of the Moment&quot; is perfectly chosen opening track, which contains a classic chorus, &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; continues the saga of the great songs, &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; introduce you the hidden skills of George Downes, who plays his keybords heavenly well, &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is the weakest chain of this album but it is till listenable track, &quot;Time Again&quot; surprises you its dark melody, &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; is interesting and enjoyable song, which is one of my favourites, &quot;Without You&quot; shows the real quitar playing abilities of Stewe Howe, &quot;Cutting It Fine&quot; is great song with hooky guitar melody, &quot;Here Comes the Feeling&quot; ends this album its own fine way and I will want to listen album again. John Wetton has a very powerful voice, Stewe Howe plays his quitar like a master,Geoffrey Downes's breathtaking keybords playing makes me smile and the outstanding drummer Carl Palmer knows how to make good beats. Words aren't enough to tell you who I love this album. Strong and catchy melodies, moody lyrics and the skills of the four musicians makes 'Asia' fantastic album.
0345457684|5.0|A stunning first novel, Altered Carbon grabs you by the throat and (almost) never lets go.  Refer to the other reviews here, for I could not improve upon them.  However, I felt that the &quot;solution&quot; to the mystery was just a bit too weak and matter-of-fact.  I would give this book a 4-star review for this reason, but the rest of the novel is so incredible it would be unfair to not give it the highest rating possible.  Read it so you can tell everyone else how amazing it is!  I look forward to Mr. Morgan's next Kovacs novel.  Supposedly, this book has been picked up by Hollywood for movie treatment, but I fear they will not do it justice.  Hope I'm wrong.
B00005ATQF|5.0|The day I saw this movie was the day I saw my favorite movie of all time. The movie is broken in 2 parts: the 1st part dealing with boot camp and the 2nd part dealing with vietnam war.  During the whole movie you see the main character Joker go through changes. <BR>I think the movie comments on a person going through the process of becoming a killing machine.  From the start you see them getting their head shaved, then go through boot camp: where get broken down and rebuilt in the image of the marines, then get shipped to the war where they must survive and use what they were taught, and then in end revert back all the way to their childhood when they were just innocent little kids.
B00005R2M3|3.0|The song Whenever Wherever has always bothered me because it contains what is perhaps THE stupidest line in a song in the history of song writing: \\"Lucky that my breasts are small and humble so you don't confuse them with mountains\\". Maybe something was lost in the English translation? In any case, this cd is uneven, with about half the cd i skip over when i play it (not a good sign of a good cd in my books). The English songs are more of a novelty than anything. Underneath You Clothes is a good song, but she has the strangest-sounding voice for it and it would have been interesting to hear someone with a stronger voice sing it instead. The lyrics are a bit silly, but i do like the song. Let's face it: Shakira is another pop singer who looks good, is photogenic, and likes to dress in tight revealing clothing. The blonde hair with the three inches of dark roots in the Underneath Your Clothes video needed to be fixed. Either stay all blonde or go back to your natural brown, but don't be so sloppy and appear in a professional video with your hair color like that. She just looked trashy, but that's what the guys want to see, right? She's T & A all the way. I'm not too familiar with her other non-English material, but the fans seem to think it's better. My prediction is one more English cd and then it's back to her country and back to singing stuff her original fans loved. The cd has some good moments, but i expected much more. Guess i fell for the commercial hype once again.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is one of the best cds i have ever heard.  Although it is short, the music on it is amazing.  If u were a fan of Hybrid Theory u will love this cd. This cd is a must buy for any fan of Linkin Park
6302250269|2.0|I give it two stars, cause the acting is pretty good.I just found it ridiculous that you were supposed to sit there and sympathize with two women who broke the law all over again, did not go and report a crime commited against THEM,and then moped around.I'm sorry, I know that it's a movie,and I may have enjoyed this film more, if it hadn't had these demands to be taken so seriously.Trying to take this film seriously will make you go crazy.Not to mention, I though the way southerners were portrayed was poor.And the movie doesn't have enough plot....
1567184855|5.0|This is perhaps the most helpful of the self-help books I have ever read.  It doesn't tell you what to do or how to help yourself. It merely tells you, through many case examples, where we go when we pass on.  It is simple and very informative but has totally turned my world upside down.  Now I know that everything I do and say counts for not just my soul but for all those souls around me.  I must improve and account for myself so I can move on and get to the place I want and need to be.  I do want this life to account for something and I certainly don't want to repeat the patterns I have before so my inward drive has been kicked into overdrive to get this life more right than I could ever have imagined.  The book is so simply clear in how we are all working toward the betterment of our souls that to not want to be on that path doesn't seem like much of an option.  Michael Newton presents the souls he studies in such a way that it is easy to identify with the situations they are in.<br />Explanations of suicide, handicaps and mental frustrations are all explained in detail.  There are few words to describe how the book affects one's daily life until you have read it.  A must read for any and all that might hold out for an afterworld.
B00000612G|5.0|Bon Jovi guitar playing is all he is good for? I think not, my mother even liked him, and she hates Bon Jovi... All That Really Matters - He sounds like Elton John, Undiscovered Soul, Hard Times Come Easy, Harlem Rain, Fallen From Graceland and Made In America are nothing short of awesome, we have alot of talentless trash floating around, but he proved with his debut solo album and now this follow up, that he isn't in that pile!!! 5 Stars ISN'T enough i'm sorry, this guy could of written himself to greatness without Bon Jovi...
B000089A07|4.0|First, I read the book Red Dragon.  After that, I watched the movie Manhunter.  Finally, Red Dragon the movie was released.  So, that is the succession of events that leads me to my rating.  Red Dragon (movie) followed the book to a much greater degree.  The thing that I liked most in Red Dragon was the motivation behind Dolarhyde's actions, this missing from Manhunter.  That, and the use of the correct ending (not the final conversation with Lecter).  Red Dragon was moodier and less Miami Vice than the former.  I also enjoyed the interplay between Lecter and Graham in the beginning, and the window into Lecter's life before his confrontation with Graham.<br />Brian Cox gave a decent performance in Manhunter, but he didn't master the seething insanity that Anthony Hopkins imbued the Lecter character with.  I really like Edward Norton in general, but he was not perfect for this role.  Ralph Fiennes was convincing.  Emily Watson and Harvey Keitel, though not spectacular, do fine.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was very slimy.<br />It appears that there are two camps of thought on this series.  I am sorry, but Manhunter was dated by its production and failed in the story where Red Dragon incorporated the book into the movie instead of using it for some 'good ideas'.
B00008MNYS|4.0|One of the great mysteries of the universe is why an international talent like Robbie Williams isn't very popular in the U.S.  His debut here in the states \\"The Ego Has Landed\\"  is one of the best albums of 1999, bursting with brilliant musical gems like \\"Angels\\"  and \\"Lazy Days\\".  But then came his shot in the foot \\"Sing When You're Winning\\", a complete mess that showed no musical or songwriting growth.  It didn't help that \\"Rock DJ\\", his worst song, was picked as the lead single.<br />So along comes his third stateside album \\"Escapology\\", and I of course was a bit skeptical about buying it.  However, I had heard the song \\"Feel\\" before buying the album.  And it's a near perfect song if I've ever heard one, with great lyrics, vocals and an insanely catchy beat.  Upon hearing \\"Feel\\", I could tell I was going to fall in love with his music again.<br />\\"Escapology\\" is a great album in all its respects.  It has a number of different styles without sounding too all-over-the-place.  It has great production and well written songs.  It has a number of great single-worthy songs and hooks.<br />It's great to see Robbie try out some different styles as in the mariachi sound of \\"Me and My Monkey\\" and the soul sound of \\"Revolution\\".<br />Even though I do like the album, it didn't blow me away as \\"The Ego Has Landed\\" did and the lyrics get a bit strange in places.  In \\"Get a Little High\\", the lyric \\"And blah blah blah blah blah\\" doesn't sound well thought out and has the effect of a CD skip.<br />The album is probably closer to a 4.5 than a 4, but I have a feeling after a few more listens, it'll grow on me and be a worthy 5.  Now all we need is for the U.S. public to take notice of this talent like it should have done all along.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It's more like vocal jazz, with country and soft rock mixed in. The lot of it is soft, lullaby-ish songs. Great for background music on a rainy day with a hot cup of cocoa, but pretty worthless on its own. Luckily, I bought it as background music, so I got my money's worth. I also like classical Indian music, and there is an influence. Listen closely to &quot;Seven Years.&quot; You'll see what I mean.<br />Did it deserve a bazillion Grammy's? I don't know. All I can say is, if you liked &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; buy it just for that.<br />It's worth it for those rainy days...
B000002I25|4.0|The Doors 1967 self titled debut album is one of the best albums released. Everything about it so good. The songwriting, the production. This album has it all a great voice, great poetic lyrics, beautiful music and a cover to go with it. The organ that makes me wanna jump and the terrific guitar play and the drums and of course Jim Morrison poets that are one of the albums biggest highlight. All the songs are brilliantly made and produced and There are absaloutely no word to describe this great album 4 1/2 stars.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|After two and a half years, the mighty riff-rockers Godsmack have released their third album, Faceless. How does it hold up? Pretty damn well, I say. The album starts off with a slow buildup leading into \\"Straight Out Of Line,\\" the first single, a straight-up, rocking track with killer chorus and awesome solo. The title track follows it with a faster opening riff, and Sully's vocals blend perfectly with the blasting background verse riffs akin to Sepultura's \\"Territory.\\" Another awesome chorus, another sweet solo. \\"Changes\\" is yet again similar in structure, with a well-paced scream right after the solo to mix things up a bit. The third time was a charm, but now, \\"Make Me Believe,\\" song four, overdoes the repitition, resulting in a lackluster track with an average chorus and riffs. \\"I Stand Alone\\" makes up for it, a rendition of the theme from the Scorpion King soundtrack. I, personally, am glad that it was included(like \\"Goin' Down\\" on Awake from the Mi2 soundtrack), but fans might not like that an overplayed song from a year ago is on here. I like it. \\"Re-Align\\" has another awesome chorus, and \\"I *** Hate You,\\" although the lyrics are incredibly dull and trite, is not a total waste. \\"Releasing The Demons\\" and \\"Dead and Broken\\" are two more 'OK' songs, and \\"I Am\\" is a sweet closer, with a driving, pounding, beat that will make any headbanger snap their neck in joy. The customary tribal closer, akin to \\"Voodoo,\\" and \\"Spiral,\\" is \\"Serenity.\\" \\"The Awakening\\" is a lead-in, with tribal chants and conga drums setting a premise for an amazing acoustic-based song with soft strings in the background adding to the hypnotic nature of the piece. A beautiful closer to an awesome album.<br />There are good things and bad things about this CD. I like the cover art, for one. It beats the previous two albums' by far. Production is different this time around. In stead of the team producing skills of Sully and Mudrock, Tool/Mudvayne producer David Botrill lends a hand here. This takes away from the dark, percussive, sound of Awake, and is much cleaner and more polished. The guitars buzz, rather than crunch or pound, and hearing nine songs of buzzing guitars would be okay, but the pounding, heavy nature of \\"I Stand Alone\\" stands alone(lol) and overshadows the other songs. This time around, the songs REALLY, REALLY, sound similar. On the s/t, the song styles told them apart, and on Awake, the song structures. But here, style and structure are generally the same, leading to a mundane, boring, feeling right before track five and track ten, where the styles suddenly switch. Tony's guitarwork is still great, with awesome wah-wah solos, and blips of feedback and harmonic lines scattered throughout the music(think \\"Trippin'\\" and \\"Immune\\") to keep things interesting. Robbie, surprisingly, takes a back seat here, with less pounding bass(like on \\"Awake\\" or \\"Greed\\"). Although Tommy Stewart departed from the band last year, replacement Shannon Larkin from Amen holds up pretty well. However, a lot of the cool stuff(like on \\"Spiral\\"), or the double bass(like in \\"Mistakes\\"), and the sweet fills(\\"Bad Religion\\") aren't present, so that subtracts from the sound as well. Sully, of course, is still awesome. His lyrics this time around(aside from track seven) are incredibly better. There's no \\"Go Away!\\" retread here...<br />Godsmack have now established themselves, along with Mudvayne, SOAD, and Incubus, as the bands that survived nu-metal's collapse. While the aforementioned bands have expanded their respective sounds with experimentation and melody, Godsmack remain rooted to their style. Faceless is a step in the right direction, but it does not have the WOW! factor Awake had. Aside from \\"Serenity,\\" there is little here that sounds like Alice In Chains, so those comparisons should be gong the way of the buffalo soon. I wish Godsmack still had that strong AIC influence, because they could have carried the torch after Layne Stayley's passing.<br />Faceless is not like previous efforts. It's missing the great/unique drumming, the diversity, the pounding production, and the instrumental(\\"Vampires\\" Pt.2? \\"Somewhere In London\\" Pt.2?). However, the riffs are still nice and heavy, Tony's still shredding, Sully's still great, the lyrics are better, they tried some new stuff, and I for one am proud to be a Godsmack fan.<br />Take that, KoRn.

0345457684|5.0|Outstanding first novel. Richard K. Morgan has just made a fan for life with this book, I hope we will see a series featuring this character.  <br />Filled with everything I love in a book, sex, violence, a little mystery and a little romance, and a [tough] character that takes no [guff].  <br />In a future where people are able to \\"download\\" themselves into different bodies (what they call sleeves), Tak Kovacs is a breed a part from the rest.  Being a former Envoy in which his mind is conditioned to exert itself and any \\"sleeve\\" he wears. <br />Great idea, however I have seen this played out before in a couple low rate movies.  Namely \\"The Sixth Day\\", in which you wonder if humans are only made up of the product of there memories.  I would like to have seen Morgan dig a little deeper into that realm.  <br />However you will enjoy this novel.

B0000025D0|4.0|The international fame and fortune, rapidly expanding fanbase, and almost univeral praise that Born To Run brought Bruce Springsteen were followed by a protracted legal battle with his former manager, during which he was not allowed to record. When he finally exploded back onto the scene three years later with this album, it was apparent that a very different Springsteen had emerged. The colorful, playful, and occasionally light-hearted romanticism that dominated the thematic content of his first three albums had completely disappeared here. On Born To Run, Springsteen had begun to turn away from the sometimes carefree saccharine sentiments expressed on his first two albums, but on Darkness, for the first time, he began exploring what was, for him, a new and emboldened theme:  the darker, often-overlooked underside of the American dream -- an area that has remained his primary territory throughout the rest of his career. This album is often cast as downtrodden and somewhat gloomy, and it certainly was at the time of release; in hindsight, since most of Bruce's subsequent material deals with even more bleak and hopeless themes, it seems hard to understand all of the attention paid to that aspect of the album. At the time, however, it was perceived as nothing less than a shock:  Sprinsteen, who had previously been the celebrated chronicler of the rebellious teenager seeking the American dream, writes here instead about the people for whom the dream has turned out to be hollow. That said, although a generally dark atmosphere pervades the record, it is not, as later albums would be, lacking optimism and completely devoid of hope. Though its characters are in grim situations, they, for the most part, realize that there is something better out there, something to hope and reach for -- whether it be The Promised Land or merely that mysterious Something In The Night. The E Street Band matches Springsteen's fiery songs with the hardest-rocking backbed Bruce has had before orsince. Max Wineberg's drums positively thunder on the driving Candy's Room and the guitar-playing on Adam Raised A Cain is fiery and inspired. The music perfectly matches and enchances the music in what makes for a solid, refined rock album. Highlights include the driving, anthemic opening track, Badlands; the aforementioned Adam Raised A Cane; the somber, stripped-down Racing In The Street, one of Mr. Springsteen's finest songs; and the title track. An album that many place among Bruce's best, Darkness On The Edge of Town is an essential purchase for the serious Springsteen fan.

B00000255F|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's first two albums were masterful strokes, stunning artistic achievements that may well have forever remained cult classics, along with Bruce himself, had he not released this seminal rock record in 1975. Whereas his first two albums were recorded on shoe-string budgets in small local studios, Born To Run was a large commercial venture, recorded in the Record Plant with full record company backing. The investment paid off. The album became a multi-million dollar seller and a perennial rock classic. It remains perhaps Bruce's most well-loved album and an unquestioned artistic watermark. His first two albums were sprawling lyrical canvases with free-form, seemingly stream-of-consciousness words flowing in from every direction; the subject matter was generally light and carefree, contained a sense of amazement and wonder, and a more-than-subtle touch of light humor. Born To Run was a complete about-face. Although not as dark as its appropriately-titled successor, Darkness On The Edge of Town, or subsequent bleak masterpieces such as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad, Born To Run found Springsteen turning his focus away from dramatized, happy-go-lucky characters to examing the shattered remnants of the American dream. The album features a colorful cast of characters bored to death of life in Smalltown, U.S.A. Though they are desperate, they are not yet hopeless (as they would later become), and they seek salvation any way they can -- whether it be busting out of their rathole for the big city, driving all night, or searching relentlessly in pursuit of love. Though the lyrics on the album are not as epic or wild as they were on the first two, they are still, for the most part, huge, grandeous productions the likes of which most artists would never even attempt to tackle. Although the playing on Springsteen's previous album at times approached virtuoso level, the playing on Born To Run, though not as technical or innovative, is the perfect framework for Springsteen's songs. Going for more of a classic rock 'n' roll sound (generous helpings of piano, with Clarence Clemons all over the place), Born To Run is an epic production the likes of which hadn't been seen since the heyday of Phil Spector. The album is chock-full of great and classic tracks that Bruce and the band still play live today:  the title track, Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, Backstreets, Thunder Road, Jungleland... the list goes on. Though not Bruce's best album, this is where he started to mature and grow into one of rock's true elite; quite simply, a seminal rock classic.Springsteen's songs.

1563899426|5.0|Bill Willingham is brilliant. Here he's taken two of the artforms most often thought of as being just for children and crafted an amusing, gripping and wholly satisfying tale for adults -- easily one of the best comics in some time.<br />In \\"Fables,\\" a long time ago a mysterious \\"Adversary\\" invaded the lands of all the fairy tale characters we've known and loved -- Snow White, the Three Little Pigs, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, etc. Many of these fables were killed in battle. The rest fled to our world, where they have established an underground society hidden amongst the normal humans, or \\"mundanes,\\" of New York City.<br />Snow White has been the leader behind the throne of Old King Cole for some time when our story begins, and Willingham kicks off this first \\"Fables\\" volume with a great mystery. Snow's sister, Rose Red, is missing. Her apartment is soaked in blood. There are a lot of suspects and a lot of motives, and no one is even sure if Rose is alive or dead. Enter Fabletown's top detective, Bigby Wolf. (Get it?)<br />Willingham's Wolf is an old-school gumshoe, a fantasy Sam Spade, and this book is the perfect blend of magic, mystery, humor and drama. You like \\"Sandman\\"? Get this book. You like \\"Into the Woods\\"? Get this book. You like good stories in general? Get this book.

B000089CKH|5.0|Nada Surf's &quot;Let Go&quot; is an excellent album that Rock/Pop fans who came of age in the 1980s should particulary enjoy because Nada Surf manage to straddle the line of Rock and Pop without being too thrashy/heavy like Metallica or too lightweight and sweet like NSync which seems to be a problem with groups over the last few years, they have no middle ground.  What Nada Surf  manage to do is walk the very fine line that groups like U2 and the Police have walked before by being very literate and melodic but still maintaining a little bit of hard rock edge.  In a fair and trend-free world where music was played on the radio based on its quality rather than its fashion, four of the opening five songs on Nada Surf's &quot;Let Go&quot; have very real potential to be Top 10 or Top 20 hits: &quot;Blizzard of '77&quot;, &quot;Happy Kid&quot;, &quot;Inside of Love&quot;, and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.  The rest of the album is no slouch either, but those tracks are the standouts.  If this album was released in the 1980s, I feel it would have been a hit on par with the Police's &quot;Synchronicity&quot;, and U2's &quot;Joshua Tree&quot;.  If you like those type of albums, I think that you will find something to like here.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|Its more like Godsmack Tasteless.  I could find a song that was an eye catcher with the exception of I stand alone.  Don't get me wrong I like Godsmack but I don't know what they were trying to get out of this album.  I enjoyed their first and second album and I bought their dvds Godsmack :Live and Godsmack :Smack This which were also really good.  With this album I found their aren't into the music as they used to be, Sully vocals are mellow, their overall style has changed, and I tend to question what happend to Tommy(their previous drummer whos been there since day one.)  Maybe its just me, however if your still interested in picking up this album, bestbuy has it for $8.99 online and offers free shipping.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Godsmack never lets me down. I've been awaiting this album for quite some time now (more than 2 years to be exact). So after loving their 2 previous albums, I couldn't wait to hear something really good from these guys. The album contains the hits \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" and \\"I Stand Alone\\"...if those are the only songs you've heard from this album, then you probably think Godsmack hasn't come a long way since the \\"Awake\\" album. However, songs like \\"Faceless\\" and \\"Make Me Believe\\" have a very agressive, yet somehow upbeat twist on their usual style. Then songs like \\"I ... Hate You\\" and \\"Releasing The Demons\\" sound like classic Godsmack. The tune \\"Re-align\\" sounds like a faster version of \\"I Stand Alone\\", and the closing title \\"Serenity\\" sounds like an experimental version of \\"Voodoo\\", with lots of soothing, yet haunting sounds. Even though it may be obvious that bands like Alice In Chains and Metallica had an influence on this band, I think it's safe to say they've made a name for themselves and have defined their own style. They don't sound like they're trying to be like anyone else, infact, this is one of the few recent bands who can deliver good ol' kick-you-in-the-butt... music. This is one of the first really great CDs of 2003.

B000002549|5.0|Classical purists are almost invariably sniffy about this album.  And even people who don't know the first thing about the music tend to seize the opportunity to see it as an example of the diva's ego and pretension.  But here's the thing:  just about every time I play this album in the company of others someone will be captivated unawares by its sheer beauty.  &quot;This is wonderful - who is it?&quot; they'll say.  And when you tell them it's Streisand their reaction is utter disbelief, often followed by annoyance.  &quot;It can't be - I don't like her!&quot; is what they really want to say.  Which just goes to show how prejudice so often gets in the way of enjoyment.  So don't be a musical snob - allow yourself the pleasure of this exquisite work.  My only complaint is that Streisand still hasn't worked up the nerve to do Volume 2.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Its alot different from the rest. great beats and lyrics but it seems like a cd that will stick with you. the more you hear it the better it gets. Ive heard it once and it was great. im suprised because the last two cds were so great i wasnt expecting the third to be different anc good. Alot of bands come out with cds similiar to each other. That sound gets boring after a while. So if you like Godsmack , pick it up

Now, Ryder took my level of drawing to a new level...realism.  His methods WORK!!<br />But, it's not instant in any way.  Realistic figure drawing takes time and patience.  The masters never rushed their work.  True art takes focus and time.  The classical masters knew this and so do the contemporary ones, like Ryder. Have fun with learning!!

B00005YW4H|4.0|This CD is very melodic with pretty nice lyrics. She has a very lovely voice and this is a nice pop CD to buy BUT it is not Jazz. Reviewers that talk about Ms. Jones as if she were a Jazz vocalist are just demonstrating a frightful lack of knowledge about the tradition. I would still listen to and enjoy this CD but it is not Jazz. Perhaps some people are confused because a few notable Jazz musicians performed on this CD, but this is a testament to their versitility as opposed to signifying that this *really* is Jazz Music. Classifying it as such is a disservice to the tradition, if not a sign of the times that we live in.
6305205620|5.0|this dvd is worth every penny. The minute i got it, i popped it into my dvd player and was blown away. Everything in this dvd is superior: from the music, to the picture quality, to the sound quality.But the only downside is that the concert is too short and there's not much interaction between Jaymes and the crowd as in Binge and Purge. Although Jayme's voice is sometimes worn out and Kirk sometimes starts his solos too late, other than that this dvd is perfect. Buy It Right now!!!!
0375701427|1.0|I hated this book! The book was bogged down with boring details that did not add to the story (ie: multiple pages on how to make leather gloves). I didn't feel that any of the characters were likeable or even worth caring about. Our book club read the book so I forced myself to read the entire book, and disliked the book as much at the end as I did at the beginning.
B00006LFGD|5.0|19 songs on 1 CD, that's worth your money.  All the songs are great.  If you want to own a Barbra Streisand CD, this is highly recommended to be your first one.  Then, you know how talented she is/has been since her Day 1.  Then, you want to buy more of her CDs.  I think she's the best!
0553213105|5.0|I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.<br /> Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.<br /> There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.<br /> Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.<br /> The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.<br /> I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen.
B000083C49|2.0|This Trek film could have been titled, &quot;Star Trek IV: Attack of the Alien Whales&quot;.<br />Why are there so many films and episodes where an unstoppable force heads right for Earth and nothing seems to be able to stop it? Why? Because the writers have so very little creativity left in them after writing so many stories over the years.<br />This film was written specifically to bring the plight of the whales to mainstream audiences through a light-hearted Star Trek film. Yes, there are a few laughs, but this is just a sign that Star Trek has become nothing more than a joke. This concept may appeal to Trekkies (which is why ST: 5 was only appealing to Trekkies and universally hated by any other human trapped inside the theater) but it serves to damage the franchise further. The end result was that the last ST film basically bombed at the theater.<br />So, yes, you can trace the loss of Star Trek's appeal to films like this one. <br />As for the special effects, there are very few at all. There was one weird sequence when the crew was traveling back in time, which had to be the dumbest segment in sci-fi history.<br />If you really feel you need to see this film, watch it for the laughs, not for the sci-fi value, because there is little to none of that.
B000083E79|3.0|For Cher, her career has been nothing but both ups and downs in the musical spectrum. Nevertheless, before Madonna, she was always the first Rock N' Roll chameleon, not only to change her look, but also her sound. What I find is so interesting about her, is that out of all her years recording hit songs, I still don't know why there are so many companies that can even make a decent Greatest Hits album for an artists like her. This one is still semi-decent, but fair.<br />The 2003, Very Best Of Cher consists of 21 of her biggest songs, some of them never released on a Greatest Hits collection before. Some of those songs include her recent Dance hits, Believe, All Or Nothing, Song For The Lonely, and Strong Enough. The album also includes some of her hits from her previous changes including, I Found Someone, If I Could Turn Back Time, After All with Peter Cetera of Chicago, and I Got You Babe with the late Sonny Bono. Still, I was a little dissapointed that there were a few of Cher's good songs that didn't fit the bill on this collection, like Love And Understanding, and We All Sleep Alone.<br />Still making music for all these years, Cher still can come back time and time again. Still, I suggest that if you want to get this album that is fine, or I suggest you get her previous Greatest Hits record, If I could Turn Back Time, released in 1999. Nevertheless, when her farewell turn ends, we'll all turn back time, and wish Cher didn't leave the music too.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's newest album FACELESS takes them back to their roots. They have that hard sound complete with killer riffs and beatiful drumming by newest member Shannon Larkin formly of Amen.<BR>Sully Erna leads the group with a more developed voice that cuts through metal. The band is destined to be the next Metallica (Of course im talking about the pre-selling out years). This is by far the best cd to come out in a long time. The guitar solos are well timed and cut perfectly with the flow of each song. There is even an acoustic guitar present on this album. This shows that Godsmack isn't afraid of experimenting. Badass cd from a badass band. Go get it now. It's the album for which all of rock standards will be put against.
B000001Y2U|2.0|There are two ways of looking at this album. One from a Goth's perspective, the other a Manson fans' perspective. When viewed as a goth-metal album, this is an outstanding piece of work. It is probably the best death-metal album on the shelves. By turns sinister, disturbing and all-out headbanging, this is a fine cd.<BR> However, when looked at in relation to his earlier and later work, Antichrist is not one of his greater works. It's too messy. It's a heavier, Satanic step-up from Portrait, but lacks the finesse and musical skill of the Bowie-esque Animals and the quite remarkable Holywood. Most of the songs end in unecessary, discortant screeching, are accompanied by badly-timed drumming, and musically, are rather crude. This marks the heavier side of Manson's style, not yet refined into his later albums but certainly setting the tone for others yet to come.<BR> To a Goth, the album is fantastic. It embodies everything a goth would stand for - darkness, shouting and heavy riffs. To a Manson fan, the album is not worth the cost, as it does not do justice to his career.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I thought that this movie was awsome! I even liked it better than the book. The actresses and actors did an amazing job, and so did Chris Columbus. All the magic that is in your head after reading the book comes to life in both this and in the first movie. The whole thing was awsome from the beginning to the end, especially the music. John Williams, who composed both the Harry Potter movie's music as well a Star Wars: Episone II: Attack of the Clones's music, did an outstanding job with the music for this particular production. To sum it all up, no matter if you did or didn't like toe first movie, you'll love this one!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Best Album of stevie Nicks perion.
B00005OWEG|2.0|There is only one reason to have released this version of the modern classic Apocalypse Now -- $$$$.  The scenes brought back from the cutting room floor should have stayed there.  The stolen surfboard scene breaks the somber, single minded intensity that is the Willard character.  The French plantation scene drags and drags (though the funeral portion IS good).  The additional bunny encounter is pure drivel.  <br />If you have a copy of original, don't waste your money on this one.  If you don't, don't waste your money on this one - find the original.  <br />It's too bad that all re-released \\"Director's Cut\\" editions aren't required to contain a copy of the original as a part of the package.
B00006BTCA|5.0|An amazing cd that sucks you in with the very first track. Almost impossible to put this album down. Wonderful, fresh, creative, and powerful from beginning to end. A must own for any fan of music.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away looks and sounds amazing on this new DVD from Disney. What do you know, Disney is holding to its promise to keep Miyazaki's movies in order and perfect. Here are individual reviews on the technical aspects of the DVD:<br />VIDEO: A+<BR>The video is presented in its original 2.01:1 aspect ratio and is enhanced for 16x9 tvs. The picture quality is much better than I remember it in theaters. The picture is crystal clear and looks fantastic. <br />AUDIO: A++<BR>The sound is really fantastic. There are 3 audio tracks on this disc: English Dub (the one used in the theatrical release, thank God) and original Japanese dialogue both in 5.1 Dolby Digital (WHY NOT DTS?!) and a French audio track presented in 2.0 Dolby Surround. Anyway, I did not hear the original Japanese dub, but let me tell you that the audio on the English version is amazing. The bass is always bumping whenever a spirit is on screen. The surrounds are very active with surround sound and dialogue is well heard. <br />That is my take on the first disc. I have not had a chance to view all of the special features but the ones that I did see were good. Get this movie immediately when it is released!
B00000G5VI|3.0|Being an avid Bowie fan, I eventually stumbled across numerous reviews on Amazon praising this album for it's musical genius, making me quite excited when I found it for only [$$]. But, to be honest, I just couldn't find it's glory. Don't get me wrong, it's still alright, but there's easily nothing on here that I see as being worthy of the high praise other reviewers have shown. Coming from one of the best artists of the century, it just isn't up to par. The songs and instrumentals featured on here seem to be merely average. That said, there may be something wrong with me. If you're a huge Bowie fan, you might want to add this to your collection, but don't be too depressed if you can't find it. That said, I can't think of any other reason to really buy this unless you've heard it and know you like it.

This has got to be a joke...right? ...RIGHT??<BR>B) The only thing that will provide a safe future for Mexico's new generation is... Baseball? (you gotta be kidding me). <BR>The movie itself isn't that bad. In fact it sometimes crosses over politically correct into the<BR>real American (sick) way of life of the last 25 years. <BR>All in all this is a [weak] ... movie with loads of crocodile tears shed in the end and an all star team of actors trying their best to save what was once called The American Dream and has now become The Worlds WORST Nightmare ...
B00008I8IF|5.0|I'll admit up front that I really wanted to like this CD, so perhaps this review is a little biased. But this CD really did deliver all that I'd hoped for and more: Smooth, bittersweet lyrics, blended, melodic harmonies, and jangles. I loved it. If you like Hollywood Townhall and Tomorrow the Green Grass, and if Sound of Lies and Smile were guilty pleasures, then you'll love this album. I can't seem to take it out of my CD player.
B00004YA66|5.0|Thrill, love, action, agony, mystery, science fiction, cool music, a fine screenplay, strong on details &amp; a careful edit. This movie was about to reach excellence if it wasn't for that <BR>stupid line that came out of Quaid's mouth: A thousand years from now when school kids study about America they gonna learn about 3 things, the constitution, rock'n'roll &amp; baseball.<BR>Hey man, I'm sure about the second one, I don't give a sh_t about the third one but as far as I'm concerned American governments wouldn't know democracy even if it fell upon them. After all this years of reading, hearing and seing things about America (The US of A) one thing is clear in my mind: To the majority of the population of the US of A &amp; their governments, Democracy is a joke. And you can take that to the Bank. The Global United States of Fasci_stan Bank.
6305603847|5.0|Being a physician - I can't get rid of looking to this movie in from a professional point of view: <br />It is not just a mere diagnosis-making-statement -a history of a mind tortured by the most painful points of the time (SIGN OF THE TIMES): (1) \\"family\\" made of a mother and a boy child (father may have died in WW2 or divorced - does it make a difference?), (2) overdose and a consequent split of a marriage (crack, spiff, junk, music, work - or anything other chemistry/social driven stuff - and she's gone ...

B000088E6M|4.0|I think this CD is hot, but you can't compare it to 2pac &quot;All eyes on me&quot; or Nas &quot;Illmatic&quot;. 50 cent is a bad rapper and you shouldn't be dissing on him for what he has accomplished or what he's trying to do, but you can't say he's as bad as 2pac or Biggie. 50 cent is my favorite rapper but yet I still don't say he's better then 2pac or Biggie. 50 cent just needs to work on his flows a little bit more and he'll be one of the best rappers in the years to come. So since this CD is hot but not as good as every said it was, a gave it 4 stars.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I started watching The Shield starting with season two. I was completely hooked. The action is non-stop and the characters are first class. It's impossible not to admire Vic Mackey, even when you know he's not a clean whistle. It's a tough, down and dirty cop show with outstanding scripts and dialogue. Catching up on the first season is a must in order to get the background for any of the show afterwards. If you are not watching it, you ARE missing a great series.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This Cd is unbelievable in every single way. Every single song on this cd could be a smash hit on every radio station world wide.  Some people love them and some people hate them, but for the ones who do, they know true music at it's finest. ... Everybody has their own opinion but if you give linkin park a chance you will see and hear the greatness in their music and personality
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack is not the greatest band, Godsmack isnt one of my favorite bands, and Godsmacks cds arent the greatest either. But the one thing that elevates Godsmack above most bands is the fact that they are an &quot;mtv band&quot; and have stayed true to their sound on every cd. True their sound has changed a little bit but only because they have matured as musicians. This isnt the greatest cd but it is definitly worth having in any metal/hard rock collection.
6305692572|5.0|I thought this movie was the most touching and heartfelt movie I have ever seen. I recomend that everyone should see it  It is a true moening of what true love is really about.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|Fans of Godsmack will welcome this new release with open arms, but the band seem to moving further and further away from their core sound as heard on their self-titled major label debut. While artistic development and growth is admirable, they shouldn't alienate the &quot;sonic assault&quot; sound that they are known for. <br />New drummer  Shannon Larkin is technically more sound, but former drummer Tommy Stewart had a harder edge that fit better within the Godsmack sound. Sully Erna takes the band in a more melodic direction and the experimentation adds more depth to their sound, but overall the guitar riffs are boring, predictable and quickly become repetitive. The only thing that makes this release worth it to listeners unfamiliar with Godsmack is Erna's increased range and willingness to explore new territory vocally. Its no longer the hard edged vocals that scream of pain and anger. There is a new resolution in the man's voice, and it adds hope to the band's future sound. If Godsmack explored more sounds in the vain of &quot;Awakening&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot; and expanded that sound beyond instrumentals, then they would be more widely recognized as musicians rather than just another rock band. For hardcore Godsmack fans, this release is a must. For others, I would recommend being open for something a little less radio-friendly.
0385503954|5.0|How anyone has the audacity to say of someone of Ian McEwan's stature and brilliance that he is just &quot;aspiring to be called &quot;literary&quot;&quot; is flabergasting to me. Who are these people?  When they have 8 to 10 best-selling, thought-provoking, mini-masterpieces under their belts, maybe I'll give them a listen . . .
0151008116|4.0|Although the first chapters are rather slow and a little pedantic, from the moment you are on the lifeboat with Pi and the animals you will be gripped, spellbound and horrified.<BR>Pi's telling of his ordeal is unbelievably believable. At times it is so brutal you can't read on, at others it is so beautiful it will make you want to weep.<BR>This is a book to be read on more than one level and more than once. The last few pages will change your whole perspective on the story and you will be left wondering whether you have misunderstood Pi completely and whether you should go back and read the whole book again. This is where the Life of Pi is so very clever and so very chilling, revealing the dark side of human nature by comparing it to the instinctive nature of animals.<br />This book makes Tom Hanks' Castaway look like a romantic comedy.

0811836363|5.0|Some may claim that this volume is a bit sugar coated from time to time. It is. They may complain that it completely ignores what was going on in society, and the beatles relation to it. It does. They may call it large, heavy and uncomfortable to read. Again, it is. But despite all of these knocks, I still can't give it less than a perfect rating. The fact is, this is the only extensive &quot;inside&quot; view of the fascinating history of the beatles. I just can't help smile as I read this book. They were the best band ever, and I can't get enough of them telling their own story. The closest you'll get to having a beatle at your dinner party. <br />If you wan't a book that talks of social importance, and doesn't shy away from some of the darker history, I can't recommend the book &quot;Shout&quot; enough. It's an incredibly well written and informative history. But at the end of the day, I just get more joy out of this book.
B00004LN16|2.0|I've been listening to AC/DC for over 20 years.<br />The songs on this particular album offer none of the uniqueness that makes any song a hit.<br />I agree only with the fact that the sound of this CD is ac/dc, but the songs are way too dry and bland.<br />Their previous CD was only slightly better than this one.<br />If you want a good ac/dc album, try these more distinctive flavors of post Bon Scott ac/dc:<br />Back in Black<br />The Razor's Edge.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I am a heavy Linkin Park fan!! I love them!! Chester's voice is so great.  I like to compare him to Mike Patton (from Faith No More) in voice range.  They are incredible.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes metal or rap (i.e. Metallica, Megadeth, Em, Rob Zombie, Faith No More).  I was worried it wouldn't be as good as Hybrid Theory (I still listen to it everyday) and it was worth the wait and it definately matches Hybrid in artistic ability and variety.  It does not sound just like Hybrid though there is a lot of different but great variation.  LINKIN PARK RULES!!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Hey NOW we are really talkin....Rock is back. Actually forget I said the word ROCK. why the labels? This album transends any of these labels of rock, or blues, or zepellin, or whatever any of the other comparisons or benchmarks posted here. Was Elvis or the Beatles compared to anyone in their time? Well probably. But anyway, this my friends for those of us that do not watch Friends or American Idol regulary, (you know who you are)might be music history in the making. This eclectic wall of sound that is Jack's guitar,with his haunting vocals,and and playful lyrics is what I havent heard for years. The music is as inspired and brilliantly crafted as one cooky musician can muster up. My advise to the masochist on this board is to stop comparing it to their earlier works.Chill out and enjoy it! By the way, have mentioned that this is a really good album.
B00008CLOA|3.0|One of the best albums ever, and one of the best candidates for an SACD treatment. However, there is at least one gotcha:<br />Before you buy, for use in a PC or PC-based home entertainment system, make sure that you have a DVD or CD player that can read the SACD format. Not all DVD players are SACD-compatible, and it can be quite a rude shock have your computer claim that you've bought a completely blank disk.
630512762X|5.0|This is my Top dvd in my entire collection. I have to admit it, even after Wolfgang Peterson's 'Air Force One that came out in the same year! This is still, the best! Nicholas Cage and John Travolta give a triumphing performance. Absolutely Amazing, I meant fit for these roles!
B00005UW9T|4.0|Do not give Disney the credit for this movie: they didn't do it!  This is a Fox Animation Studios product (the studio unfortunately folded after the disasterous Titan A.E.), and it has some rather glaring animation mistakes throughout, BUT it's still a fantastic film.<br />The music is wonderful, the colors are absolutely beautiful, the characters are engaging and sympathetic, and the story is fun. The lack of historical accuracy is no problem if you can tell the difference between fact and fiction.  If you're in the mood to do some research on the last of the Romanovs, you might check out Nicholas and Alexandra, a great book. And why has no one mentioned the wonderful job that John Cusack has done with Dimitri?  He's the only character in the movie who goes through a convincing change of heart. Aww[...] No matter your age, there is something for you in this movie.  And for you hopeless romantics, this in one of the best animated romances you'll ever see.
B00000K0E5|5.0|I really liked this movie, to be honest. I think Pierce Brosnan does an excellent performance as James Bond. I've seen all his James Bond films up into the latest, 'Die Another Day, which I really enjoyed too. I saw that in theaters. The dvd has really great special features too, Original Theatrical Trailers and TV Spots! Documentary, The World of 007! Music Video &quot;Goldeneye&quot; by Tina Turner. It was a really great Bond Movie! Spectacular! I loved it.
B0000509C4|3.0|this movie is pretty good considering its uniqueness. it's diffrent than your regular horror film. it's not scary but the story's are pretty good. there's 3 stories in this dvd and some cool animation. the first story is about a wooden indian who comes to life and gets revenge for his people. theres some funny parts in this story and its not really scary but the thought of the wooden indian coming to life is pretty scary. this story is about a 7 from 1-10 on scariness. and the second story is about a some sort of killer blob that eats people. its about a 7 on 1-10 scariness, its a pretty good story and the third story is about a hitchiker coming back from the dead. this one isnt scary at all, its a little lame but its about a 5 on 1-10 level. overall , its a ok dvd. theres not that many extra's but its a unique film, worth buying.
B000063WDH|5.0|There is so much to like about this album.  It is certainly very different from everything else out there, yet it is still highly accessible.  The tracks are quite catchy - all of my friends loved the album the first time they heard it.  My favorite trait, though, is the Lo-fi imperfection of their sound.  So much of what is out there is so severely polished by the time it hits the CD that the &quot;life&quot; of the music is filtered out.  This album is different.  It is raw, it is unpolished, and it is beautiful.
B00003CXSP|4.0|this wasnt like the silence of the lambs but it was still a good movie just diffrent. i watched it about 6 times its so good. its very entertaining just like silence of the lambs or even more.i would recomend this dvd and say its worth buying. i watched the second disk in the dvd and that is also good and interesting. i recomend hannibal to anyone who isnt that squemish and likes a good thriller.
B000088E6D|4.0|Buble sounds like a cross between Frank Sinatra and Mel Torme, and that's a good thing.  He favors Sinatra more on the uptempo tunes, and Torme on the ballads, but the end result is very pleasing.  While this album is somewhat derivative, that's not surprising for a 25 year old, and it is his first album after all. He's even got the guts to use Sinatra's original arrangements on &quot;For Once in My Life&quot; and &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; by Don Costa and Billy May, respectively, so it's possible to do a direct comparison with Sinatra.  Sinatra kicks the arrangements harder and swings a little more, but then, he was the best singer in the world.<br />It's also interesting to hear how the more contemporary songs hold up next to standards.  Buble hits a home run with &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and a triple with &quot;Moondance,&quot; but &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot; and &quot;Broken Heart&quot; didn't do it for me at all. <br />I sure would like to hear him do an entire album of standards not associated with Sinatra with a big band arranged by someone like Johnny Mandel.  I'm looking forward to see how he develops.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|WOW! I would of never imagined that Godsmack's third album \\"FACELESS\\" would be one of the best heavy metal albums i have ever listened to.I have been a fan of Godsmack from the beggining. It seems that the band has matured with their melodies and lyrics. This is one of very few albums where you can listen to it without skipping a track.My personal favorite track is \\"Re-Align\\". The thing that makes this track great is the awesome guitar solo. So if you wanna heavy metal album that will take you on a roller coaster ride of guitar solos, catchy vocals, awesome drum beats, and pounding bass riffs, you need to buy Godsmack's \\"FACELESS\\"
B00005JKN9|4.0|It is the first time I have gone to the Martin Scorsese's movie so it is so difficult for me to appraise the director's direction ability. But I saw the movie and I am impressed huge scale and Daniel Day-Lewis's acting. Especially I think that the minor character's ating is very impressed. I think their acting is better than major characters, Leonardo Dicaprio or Cameron Diaz. <BR> Also I realize that Daniel Day-Lewis is very nice and excellent man during seeing the movie. When I had seen the movie, In the name of the father, I thought Daniel Day-Lewis is a common actor but I saw this movie and I feel his acting to overpower the audience. I think he is the best act in this year. I expect him to get a prize in many awarding ceremony.<BR> I want you to see this movie as soon as possible. I'm really impressed this movie.
B00004CWO8|5.0|First of all, Adam Cooper can do no wrong.  So you realize I'm already biased in favor of this production.  I've been wanting to see this having missed it on stage - and am not disappointed I purchased the DVD.  What a moving interpretation of Swan Lake.  Of course, Swan Lake is very moving, but the modern twist added an interesting element as did Adam playing the swan.  Even if you are not a fan of ballet, the music will move you.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I sure have mixed feelings here. This is an album in a not very kind spirit toward the 'villain' protestant movement in Europe. Are they witchy? I don't know (they ARE from western Europe). But golly this is a great album, hard to turn away from. It's just sooooo good.<br />It has been years since I've listened to this album. But the word &quot;album&quot; really fits here. This is one of those that plays through with tonal integrity (phrase?) like a single work, and not a mere collection of songs gathered to fill album space. An album with a concept; this is one of the greats, and Tull is one of the great classic rock artists (with some definite jazz in the mix - and classical, baroque? - not sure of the correct class, but would certainly play alright at a 'renaissance fair', if you get my drift). The music and songs are strong classics, and it's solid art that transcends the genres in which it exists. I first bought this album, when I was 10 years old, and had seen it in the collection of the older brother of a friend in Waxahachie, Texas. Now, 30 years later, I can enjoy it every bit as much, I have no doubt.<br />**This review does not include the bonus tracks.
B000003S0P|5.0|Red, for all practical purposes, is the metamorphosis of King Crimson, the heaviest and most inspired of all the original prog. acts, into an almost standard rock band.  Crediting David Cross and Mel Collins as mere backing musicians, the 3-piece core of the 70s Crimson lineup shapes the band's sound into a sleek guitar powered rocket.  Fripp's lofty creative ambitions that past albums like Lizard had thrived on are almost entirely stripped away as the group's always evident rock base erupts into the foreground.  Even under the unfamiliar guise of a rock group however, King Crimson still proves they are one of the 70s most accomplished acts.  Heavier than Led Zeppelin while still as complex as Jethro Tull, Red is a form of guitar rock that could only ever be generated by the versatile, perfectionist mind of Robert Fripp.  In fact, the sole reason why King Crimson sounds so powerful as a straight rock band is because each of the musicians is incredibly well informed by a multitude of other styles, allowing them each to bypass genres entirely by manipulating their instruments in unprecedented ways before effortlessly applying the results to a rock backdrop.  As an example, John Wetton plays bass as a complete solo instrument, Bill Bruford's elaborate fills and bass drum triplets are far more complex than the average 4:4 rock beat, and Robert Fripp is as unconventional as ever (listen to the 2 note solo in Starless).  Considering that King Crimson have always been one of the harder edged acts in the wide spectrum of Prog rock, their transition to an elevated incarnation of a 70s hard rock group is not that surprising and actually ends up being quite a smooth transformation.  Furthermore, with their increased acceptance of rock, the group finally sheds all the incredible limitations imposed by the progressive moniker, but Crimson also does so without bowing down to the equally daunting limitations of rock, an action that Fripp should be applauded for.  While Red is certainly still a great King Crimson album, probably one of their best actually, it is much less of a sampling of the group's origins and much more of an ideal realization of the pinnacle of classic rock, a stunning feat which could only really be accomplished by a group whose talents surpass the realm of rock.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I think this miniseries is very good and very powerful in a sense that you would not understand.  This is the best miniseries that was made for World War 2.  I have had see many World War 2 films but nothing that tops this.  You have not only that fact is about a company of men but it is about the famous Easy Company of the 506th and 101st airborne division.<BR>In the first episode called Currahee they have a commander named Sobel and this man is about the first man they meet in a series of commands and they meet this man Sobel.  In the next couple of episodes they start the drops on Normandy during D-Day and that episode is called the Day of Days.  Then you have a very cool episode called Carantan it is the raid on Market Garden that is episode 3 then 3 episodes later they have the infamous Battle of the Bulge.  That takes up 2 episodes of the miniseries episodes 6 and 7.  After episode 8 they get ready to come off the line and they go ahead into the forest and spot what is one of the German POW camps where they spot some stuff they do not want to see.  They find prisoners of war there and they find that they are getting killed in gas chambers and they are not being fed very well because they are all skin and bones.  After that they meet up in the final episode and raid one of Hitler's famous homes called the Eagle's Nest and finish raiding it and after that they set fire to the home and they win the war.<br />All in all this miniseries made by HBO will get your heart going it is a very sad movie and that will make you feel bad for the men in Easy Company.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I just bought the DVD today.<br />I enjoyed this film a great deal, it is not as bogged down as the first with introducing everyone and all the escapades. If you have read this book, this is a faithful compressed version of the story. <br />The extras on the second disk are very nicely done, just enough to tempt, but not enough to completely satisfy. Then again, I am not a 12 year old, I am 36. <br />Touring Dumbledore's office was particulary well done and viewing all the sleeping portraits made you feel like you were right there.<br />In the section SKETCHES, the artwork that shows how the characters  - Dobby, Basilisk, Fawkes (among others) - is very interesting.I like seeing how things develope from drawing to final product.  There are further sketches of a scene ( Harry meeting Dobby for the first time in his bedroom , as an example.) that I would have loved to see in the book, they have a very magical quality about them, much more than the spartan artwork given.<br />The interview with JK Rowling and the Steve Kloves (script writer) was very informative and enjoyable. Even the script writer does not really know what is going to happen in the future books and that has to be frustrating for him.<br />I got the feeling from this interview that the reason why specific scenes were kept or not used at all were because they were essential for the future books and movies.<br />I would give this five stars, but I would love to see more, more, more behind the scenes interviews.
B000062XLZ|4.0|I saw this movie when I was eighteen. At that time, I learned about Oriental history, and knew that Thai is the only sovereign nation in Southeast Asia. I wonder how such a small country its independence and it could be solved while I saw Anna & King.<BR>At first, it is malvelous to me that Chinese famous actor and American actress appear on the same movie. But they are very good pair in the movie, and I come to think they're a wonderful couple. <BR>A custom peculiar to Thai is another joy to the viewer. We can also see Malfoy(`Harry Potter')'s childhood.(He is Anna's son.)<BR>^^
B00005JLWL|5.0|Sci-fi flick with stunning visuals, \\"Equilibrium\\" deserves much more attention not only from fans of genre, but also from general audiences.  Sure, its flaws are too visible, borrowing Orwellian ideas from other films like, say, \\"Brazil,\\" but it is not that ideas themselves but the way they are put into practice that really counts, and on that score \\"Equiliburium\\" is a winner.  (And critics, please let me know, why do you all praise Steven's \\"Minority Report\\" which actually borrows ideas from other films of this genre?  So, why not give this one a due respect?)<br />Well, I admit the opening chapter of \\"Equilibrium\\" is a bit weak, introducing us to the dystopia world after the WW3, but soon you will forget that.  The totalitarian government established after the war decided to eliminate anything that might possibly make humans emotional, forcing the people to inject a certain doze of [chemical substance] to be unemotional every day. Moreover, it decrees there should be no more music (not only hip-hops, but classic music), no more motion pitures, and no more decorated interiors.  Those who love them hide underground, becoming rebels while the authroity set up a super-cop troop called \\"Grammaton Clerics.\\"<br />Christian Bale (\\"American Psyco\\") is John Preston the best of the Clerics, and dedicates himself to the job until he arrests a woman Mary O'Brien who possessd illegal stuffs.  But her strong creed and perhaps beauty make their way into the sleeping heart of Preston, who has been long fighting for his cause.<br />The film's philosophical messages are in themselves not new at all, and director Kurt Wimmer might have kept his idea a little too long.  I say so, because today, in the 21st century, it is not this Orwellian society that we are afraid of most.  The story has enough twists to surprise us, but maybe one too many, I think, and the wrap-up part of the film feels a bit hurriedly done.<br />However, those are noting before the film's sensational action scenes, which can make up for any flawed part of the film.  The \\"Gun-Kata\\" fighting deserves special mention, using [weapons] like Japanese swords, and its hyper-kinetic movement is very violent and very beautiful at the same time.  Incredible it might sound, but Christian Bale shows excellent action star quality here, displaying the beauty of \\"Kata\\"s -- and \\"kata\\" means in Japanese \\"style.\\"  Yes, there are lots of styles in \\"Equilibrium.\\"<br />Other plsyers are also effectively cast, and most unexpected is Emily Watson, who quite naturally becomes the Joan D'Arc-like character.  Taye Diggs is good as Preston's partner, and though short time, Sean Bean, cast against type, is also perfect as Partridge who plays a key role in the story.<br />I was quite surprised and satisfied, and even thrilled to see this neglected film, which should have been more pushed.  Again I say, its actions are sensational.  Not that this is \\"Matrix\\"; rather, it is more unique and has its own \\"kata\\" = style, which means a lot these days.
B00004TH83|2.0|I found this CD very disappointing.  Adagio is the only memorable song in my opinion.  Lara definitely has a beautiful voice, but, as with so many singers right now she seems to think that &quot;belting&quot; is what is required on every song and tonal quality is often lost.  Makes for a very bland bunch of songs.  I'll take Celine any day.  Lara co-wrote &quot;Broken Vow,&quot; which I think is an exceptional song, but I'd rather listen to Josh Groban's version.  He knows how to put his heart into a song.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang's spectacular, gargantuan and visionary METROPOLIS has been seen for over 75 years but only in edited editions.<br />Now, digitally restored under the supervision of the Murnau Foundation, here is the most complete version ever. With the addition of the sometimes Wagneresque 1927 orchestral score by Gottfried Huppertz, Metropolis can finally be enjoyed in its full  eye-popping glory.  The story takes place in 2026 (hey, not so far off), when the class differences of the human race are dramatically divided between poor laborers who live underground in dark warrens and labyrinths and the rich who live above in the light of towering, futuristic splendor.<br />The truly iconic images in this movie -- as famous as any in the 20th century -- have profoundly influenced the sets, ideas, props and themes in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner and even Star Wars.  A. O. Scott of the New York Times rightly called Metropolis &quot;A fever dream of the future.&quot;  This version is over one third longer than any previous release and is by far the most complete since its Berlin premier<br />Worthwhile extras include a fine commentary by film historian Enno Patalas, great 5.1 surround sound of the  newly recorded orchestral score, &quot;The Metropolis Case&quot;: a wonderful 43-minute documentary, Photo Galleries of production stills, fascinating missing scenes, striking architectural sketches, posters and more. Highly recommended.
B000002HMH|3.0|This album is proof that money, success, and easy living can completly kill the Godfathers of thrash metal.  This album is barely even metal.  AS good as many of the songs are, and the material is still better than 90% of the bands out there, the speed with which they move shows that Metallica have completely lost the edge that took them to the top.  I'm reminded of Apollo Creed saying to Rocky that 'Its the eye of the tiger.'  I listen to this record a lot, because its a very good rock record, just not the thrash that makes Kill'em All, Ride the Lightning, and Master of Puppets absolute must records for metal lovers.
B000089RVX|5.0|I refuse to have television in my household, and so it was that while I was at a friend's house, I happened to catch the video for &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; on MTV and I was absolutely floored; this from someone who is under most circumstances DISGUSTED by MTV. Amazing talent that reaches across categories and grabs you in a raw, but beautiful way, capitalizing on the polarity of soaring vocals and crunching guitar snarls.
B00000IQUT|1.0|I gave this movie at least one star because the woman got revenge. I was so digusted and shamed by this movie[...]This is a sick, sick movie about a horrific experience that women face everyday. This movie is basically rape porn, so if you enjoy that then rent it, but if you are a normal human being and are sickened by the act (which is very graphic in this movie) then avoid this [...].
0140277447|4.0|The book, The rape of Nanking by, Iris Chang is mind boggling, but keeps your attention from start to finish. It is definitly one of my favorite books. The way Iris Chang writes about the events in Nanking is so intreging because she writes the story from every different point of view. I highly recommend this book. It is repulsive but interesting.
B00006F83Y|4.0|The first time I heard Queens of the Stone Age, I said to myself: &quot;wow, something fresh and raw on the radio for once.&quot; When I finally got myself to listen to the whole album, I was literally blown away and surprised. I did not expect such a brilliantly crafted and addicting album. It brings back an old school sound that the radio *really* needs. Everything about the album is worth mentioning, from the brilliant vocal work, to the impressive guitaring, to the powerful and loud bass sound, and to the excellent drumming by Dave Grohl, originally of Nirvana. If you are a rock fan, it would be an absolute misjustice to not get this album; it has 'must-own' written all over it. It is not quite 'perfect', but not many discs are. In any case, thank god for Queens of the Stone Age. Big Thumbs Up.<br />Best tracks: &quot;Song for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; and everything else :).
B000089RVX|2.0|Hmmm.  Nu-metal with better vocals.  Well you can pour chocolate syrup over cow manure but how much better does it really taste?  It's on par with a Creed album.  To comapre it with Tori Amos is just silly.  I keep hearing this hailed as some sort of &quot;gothic rock&quot; too.  Huh?  EvanEssence isn't awful, but they're nothing to get excited over.
B000067CPX|4.0|The first time I heard Queens of the Stone Age, I said to myself: &quot;cool, finally an original band on mtv.&quot; I didn't really care much for them until I actually heard their whole cd, and I can tell you I was not only surprised, but blown away. Not only does this album bring back an old school sound to the radio that we have not heard in a long time, but it is also briliantly crafted and concieved. Everything about it is worth mentioning, from the brilliant vocal work, great guitaring, the powerful and loud bass sound, and the excellent drumming from Dave Grohl (originally of Nirvana). I cannot stress enough how important it is that you buy this cd if your a rock fan. For you people that listen to too much Linkin Park or Disturbed, this album just may surprise you and change your perspective on rock music. Thank god for Queens of the Stone Age. Big thumbs up. <br />Best tracks: &quot;Song for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Go with the flow&quot; and everything else :)
B000000WCA|4.0|The Spice Girls ARE POP. They are it. But they are tunes, not lyrics. Most of the songs have meaningless lyrics but have cool tunes/music. Back then i luved 'em.

B00005JLXC|4.0|I admit I had my doubts about seeing a Daredevil movie. Eventhough I had been a fan of ole hornhead for years, I still wasn't convinced that they could actually pull it off. Director Mark Steven Johnson does pull it off, albeit with a few problems, and does so rather well. <br />Daredevil is a blind super hero. That in itself is a bit unusual. He has no real \\"super powers\\". He has however heightened senses that were brought about by an accident when a young 12 year old Matt Murdock had a accident. A barrel of industrial wasted took his sight by increased the sensitivity of all his other senses. He can hear a whisper a block away. But now he also has a \\"radar\\" sense, which the filmakers portray in a very convincing manner. By day Murdock is a trial lawyer defending the innocent. By night he puts on a red leather costume and metes out his own brand of justice.<br />People had alot of complaints about this movie. One of the main ones I often heard was the disdain for Ben Affleck. Believe me when I say this, Ben Affleck does a very convincing job as the Man Without Fear. Affleck is reportedly a big DD fan. So there was little fear by director Mark Steven Johnson that he wouldn't take the role seriously. Colin Farrel however steals the movie as Bullseye. An Irish assasain hired by Michael Clark Duncan's character the Kingpin. Farrel brings life to one of my favorite villains from the DD comic book. My biggest complaint was his costume design. He looks more like a reject from the Village People than a hired hitman. Jennifer Garner, is fabulous as Elektra Natchios, Murdock's love interest. The response to Garner's character has been positive enough that Elekra is now slated to have her own movie.<br />One of the biggest problems I have with Daredevil is the pace of the film. Clocking in at about 1 hour and 45 minutes, the film feels like it is rushed. Johnson is said to have cut over 30 minutes of running time from the film. Perhaps that additional footage will be includedon the DVD. But to the non DD fan there is little in the way of character development. The fight scenes however, make up for what is lost. The confrontation between DD and Bullseye brings to life one of my favorite scenes from Frank Miller's run on the Man Without Fear. In comic book lore this is one of the more epic showdowns in the Marvel Universe. Though not earth shaking, it was brought to life with great care and respect. One thing that alot of comic book fans didn't appreciate were the many changes that were made from the comic. Nobody certainly likes changes, but it would be impossible to tell a story like this without any changes at all. One of the changes I dissapointed with was in a young Matt Murdocks training. A major guiding force in his life was omitted. I'm hoping that in the sequal it will be revisited.<br />This is certainly not an \\"A+\\" movie by any means. However it's certainly not a \\"B\\" movie. I gave it 4 stars because there's no rating for 3 and a half stars. You certainly won't feel ripped off after seeing Daredevil. But it's certainly not the greatest super hero movie ever made by anymeans. What it does do well is it introduces a character that has been languishing in obscurity for decades. It also sets the table for what will probably become, like X-Men before it, another franchise film for Marvel.
B000089RVX|3.0|This is undoubtedly a very good CD. The lyrics make sense to me just because they are about losing your grip and confusion. The only problem is that Every Sing Song sounds exactly the same. I wouldn't recommend it but i would recommend getting the daredevil soundtrack because it has songs other than evanescence because every song sounds just like 'Bring me to life'
B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis' \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" is considered the most beloved album that they've ever released besides \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\". This CD follows the epic closing track \\"Supper's Ready\\" from \\"Foxtrot\\" and heads into a much earthier more natural progressive rock sound. The whole album, even the poppier sections, has a highly medieval color to it. Keep in mind that this album is almost totally opposite to their more hated 80s albums. Where as those are highly polished masterpieces, \\"Selling England\\" is a totally different masterpiece all on it's own. Those who are into \\"Land Of Confusion\\", \\"That's All\\" and \\"Abacab\\" will be highly thrown off by the rich and highly and sometimes even dauntingly complex nature of the eight compositions on this AMAZING album. Even a \\"PC Genesis\\" head like myself can't deny that some of the beauty of this album or the two before it has been sorely missed on Genesis' latter albums. Let me just say that all eight of these pieces are just wonderful to listen to. This whole CD is almost like watching a medieval movie.<br />\\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" is a wonderous and dreamy epic song with gorgeous mix of electric and acoustic guitarwork courtesy of Steve Hackett and storytelling from our beloved Peter Gabriel. The song as in almost all progressive rock songs, morphs in rhythm and tone starting with Gabriel's acapella and as a lovely acoustic ballad then becoming a energetic rocker but maintaining the medieval tinge of the calmer parts. Eventually the song becomes and electrifying rocker once again before fading down into a gorgeous and dreamy acoustic number before fading out into the night. \\"I Know What I Like In Your Wardrobe\\" was Genesis first hit song of their career fusing clever arrangement and lyrics combined with catchy melody and awesome drumming from Phil Collins. This song is just a joy to listen to. \\"Firth Of Firth\\" is ahead of it's time with the use of surprisingly electronic keyboards and also the use of classical mellotron arrangements. \\"More Fool Me\\" is a fragile and romantic acoustic guitar ballad with Phil Collins on lead vocal. Unlike what some say, this is NOT Collins' first song as lead vocalist. That was on \\"For Absent Friends\\" on the \\"Nursery Cryme\\" LP. Nonetheless, MFM is nice counterpoint to the epics of the rest of the album. Collins voice around this time was very similar to Peter's but they would eventually develop their own different voices over time. The main epic on here is the nearly 12 minute long epic track \\"The Battle Of Epping Forest\\". The song opens with the sound of a British colonial marching parade that moves across the landscape and then the rocking song begins, depicting the start of a battle on a battlefield. The song is a marvelous chaos of story-telling, catchy melody and rhythm and unforgettable humor. Overall, this could as well be the `battlefield' theme of this album. \\"After The Ordeal\\" is a fantastic and gorgeous instrumental that kind of is like the aftermath of the \\"Battle of Epping Forest\\" with a highly medieval sound and gorgeous acoustic guitar playing from Steve Hackett. \\"The Cinema Show\\" is another fantastic epic piece with a wonderful rainbow of morphing melody and rhythm. This song does kind of drag on a bit but is absolutely wonderful nonetheless. The song merges wonderfully with the closing track. \\"Aisle Of Plenty\\" brings the album full circle with a 1:30 reprise of \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" and fades out, almost bring the album full circle before closing it out.<br />\\"Selling England\\" is a definite must-have Genesis album for those who love the progressive side of the groups works. Be forewarned though, this album is almost as far away from the electric mechanical production of their 80s albums like \\"Invisible Touch\\" or \\"Genesis\\" but for those who want to hear a totally different side from those albums, \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" is an album that is absolutely worth checking out. Trust me, this album is a hell of a aural ride and is worth taking, that is if you're willing to temporarily put down \\"Abacab\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\" for a little while. Even though I'd rather listen to the industrial mechanical chimes of \\"The Brazilian\\" from IT, I am absolutely proud to own and enjoy \\"Selling England\\". To tell you the truth, I'm more than likely one of the rare Genesis fans out there who enjoys \\"Selling\\", \\"The Lamb\\", \\"Abacab\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"We Can't Dance\\" and even \\"Calling All Stations\\". This album is definitely one of the golden art-rock albums and is an essential for those who are fed up with the blandness of the commercial pap of nowadays. We need more art-rock albums like this again! This is considered to be the last `traditional' Genesis album with long songs but a great one to close out their `traditional' era. I say \\"Invisible Touch, Genesis, We Can't Dance &amp; Calling All Stations, get in the back seat for now!\\". He he! :-D :-Dhell of a aural ride and is worth taking, that is if you're willing to temporarily put down \\"Abacab\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\" for a little while.

B000002KHF|5.0|Before I heard \\"Moondance\\", I had vaguely heard of Van Morrison, but didn't know any of his songs beside \\"Brown-eyed girl\\". During a long, grueling road trip, I decided to buy this tape on a whim at a truck stop because it was cheap, and looked interesting. As soon as the music started, I knew I was hearing something special. This album is just pure magic. The songs are a perfect mix of rock, jazz, and even gospel elements, somehow blended into a soulful whole. The whole vibe of the album is just experiencing a perfect warm summer's day. I just cruised with it the whole eight-hour trip, and the miles flew by. And \\"Moondance\\" hasn't left my tapedeck since. Really, if you love music, you'll love this album. I'm so grateful to have been introduced to Van Morrison's artistry, and this album will always rank on my top ten list of all time.
B00004XMV6|2.0|As you probably have guessed from my review title, I am  somewhat of a Kim Basinger fan and so the extra star I'm giving for this review goes to her. She has the looks and the acting skills which pretty much gaurantees success for any actress. So I was up one night channel surfing and I came across this 9 1/2 Weeks movie. I figured since there was nothing else on I would go ahead and watch it. Well, despite the bit of sleazy content I couldn't really identify what the actual plot was. My only guess is that Mickey Rourke is trying to get Kim Basinger to see the erotic side of art pictures along with having a relationship with her that is only based on sex. Aside from this mediocre plot, the rest of 9 1/2 Weeks seems to drag. I can't imagine the sequel to this movie being any better or any worse for that matter.
B0000026CN|5.0|This is a really great disk. For someone that likes a variety of different music like I do it is a must in anyones collection.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Even if you went out and bought the 8 tape VHS version of the anthology a few years ago, go out and this this DVD set. It is a MUST HAVE for Beatle people.<BR> Of course, the picture quality is great. This will be the very best copy of old concert footage you will find. However, the thing that really got to me was the sound. Hearing all those great songs remixed in 5.1 surround sound is out of this world! Take for example 'I Am The Walrus'. On the original recording, it switches to fake stereo half way through the song, due to recording limitations of the time. Now, in this anthology, the entire song is in fabulous 5.1! It is fantastic. Every song was obviously carefully remixed.<BR> The extras on the 5th disc are really good and interesting. The only thing I would have liked to have seen was extra concert footage (ex. the entire Shea Stadium or Washington concerts).<BR>Still, seeing Paul, George, and Ringo playing together for the last time was very touching. Definately worth every penny.
B000002JSR|5.0|I just gave this a re-listen after 15 years.  As someone that enjoys a nice spring day in the car blasting Zeppelin, I also am inspired by new music genres including drum and bass, hip-hop, etc.  Bonzo's Montreaux is a testament to how some music, regardless whether it is one instrument, is absolutely timeless and relevant.  <br />So, while CODA is not the #1 must buy in the Zeppelin arsenal, it is still relevant and worth a listen.
B000005ALN|5.0|I LOVE this CD and I listen to it nearly every day.  There is no one else like George Michael-a TRUE talent and what a VOICE!  This CD is fabulous and yes, he is &quot;Older&quot; and it shows (he's better than ever).  If you don't have this CD you are truly missing out. You will love it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora is a true amalgalm of styles. Rap-Rock and electronica meld seemlessly to create another solid effort for Linkin Park. This one takes a couple of listens to &quot;creep&quot; on you before you realize it's true power. Some tracks are harder than anything on Hybrid Theory like Hit the Floor(which may be the best song they've done so far) and Lying from You; they are subsequently the strongest tracks on Meteora. As the album progresses past it's first 5 tracks, Meteora begins lean more towars electronica/hip-hop with the standout tracks Figure.09, Breaking The Habit, and Nobody's Listening. Bennington and Shinoda's smooth vocal exchanges continue to act as the solidifying force behind Linkin Park's distinctive sound. There are some flaws, Easier to Run is could easily be called Crawling Pt. 2 and the album clocks in at only a little over 36 minutes. Nonetheless, this is a definite must buy for any fan and a worthy successor to their (soon to be) legendary debut Hybrid Theory. The band has taken their &quot;hybrid theory&quot; and enacted it on Meteora. Highly Recommended.
B000005ALN|5.0|I love this CD and I listen to it nearly every day.  George Michael is a genius--a TRUE talent. What a voice. Every song is fabulous and yes, he is &quot;Older&quot; and you can tell. No one writes songs like him. If you don't have this CD, make sure and get it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000002J1B|4.0|RELAYER was an album which took a long time for me to enjoy or appreciate. When I first bought it back in 1974, it seemed very off-putting--Patrick Moraz' jazzier keyboard style had replaced Rick Wakeman's more Romantic classical approach and I initially wasn't crazy about it. But I've warmed to this album considerably and find it perhaps the most atypical of their discography---a good thing. \\"The Gates Of Delerium\\" starts off with regal pomp--troops heading off for battle--devolves into the chaos of battle itself (Alan White is in especially fine percussive form on this part) and then resolves into Jon Anderson's hymn-like \\"Soon, o soon the night.\\" It's everything they aimed for on \\"Ritual,\\" from the preceeding album TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, but more focused, sinister and, ultimately, more uplifting at the end. \\"To Be Over\\" also features a fine, self-contained energy, with Steve Howe's guitar prowess meshing nicely with Moraz and White in an extended instrumental section. I'm still trying to get to like \\"Sound Chaser,\\" the second track on the album, but in spite of some great jazz-like playing in sections of it, I find it too diffuse and rambling to engage me. I especially don't care for Howe's unaccompanied electric guitar solo in the middle, which really does sound like aural wanking. But two out of three ain't bad. RELAYER shows a band trying out some of the outer limits of their style, mostly with sucess.
B000066C1N|3.0|I enjoy all of the songs on the soundtrack. The producers must have released a bad batch. My CD has distortion on some of the songs. The distortion is very apparent at the end of Track 1: Here I am.<BR>I would have given it a 5 had it not been for this distortion.
B000069AUI|1.0|I got this cd basically just for the song clocks. that song is one of the best new songs, in my opinion, that I've heard in a while. the song's just awesome. I mean it really is. but I'm just not getting the other ones that much. they're slow and boring to me - either slow and boring, or dull and repetitive. or all of the above. ... Clocks is awesome. I dunno, maybe get the cd for clocks? whatever. I'm not terribly impressed YET - but then I've just gotten the cd, and maybe I need to \\"discover\\" it. ...My liking for Clocks reminds me of that, and like Poison, it stands out from the rest of the songs. None of the other songs on this cd have such a cool melody or anything. ... A beautiful, enchanting piano melody that's almost unmatched, and which sticks in your mind, nice strings and all, nice vocals. even the drumming is good. just a good song, it all works together. okay so maybe not I've overrated it somewhat and all, but oh well....
B00005JLSC|4.0|Chicago was a breath of fresh Broadway air!  Costumes, glamour, and foot tapping tunes.  While the plot wasn't rocket science, the stars delivered one heck of a performance.  My first trip was with the girls on a night out, but my husband and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around.  Great date movie - steamy with plenty left to the imagination.  I'd add another 1/2 star to make it a 4.5.  Enjoy!
B00008DDSC|5.0|In the movie, Maggie Gyllenhaal, is a self inflicted cutter.. Her father is<BR>an alcoholic.  It doesn't take a whole lot to put two and two together as to<BR>why she cuts herself.. At least it didn't to me.  There is a whole lot of<BR>differing opinions on why anyone does the SM lifestyle, but the main consensus<BR>usually ends up that most were raised in some type of dysfunctional<BR>home.<br />Maggie needed to feel that she was \\"really alive\\"..she felt virtually<BR>ignored growing up in an alcoholic home, because licquor was the fuel for<BR>her father, enabling him to do it was her Mom's fuel.. leaving Maggie to<BR>flounder in such dysfunction.  So to compensate for that, she cuts herself<BR>to watch herself bleed.  It did give her a small moment of clarity, of<BR>\\"realness\\".. Yet, they locked her up in a mental institution for this.  She<BR>had no confidence, no esteem.. nothing.. until she gets that job.. and once<BR>Spader takes on the sadist role, and gives her another outlet for feeling \\"really alive\\", she likes it.. :)  She wants it to continue forever.  :)<br />He tells her what to eat, how to dress, how to do her job, all of that..uses her for his own pleasure, and disciplines her when she screws up..What's not to like?  :O)))  <br />Mainly  Spader pays lots of attention to her, making her feel needed and important.  Something she has dreamt of for her lifetime, but never received.<br />Seriously.. The only thing that disturbed me a<BR>bit was Spader's reaction to his doing that.  It seemed like he thought himself dirty or cheap for liking to spank women, for the sadistic pleasures.. <BR>A  movie like this is So hot to watch, especially when you switch.. :)  You<BR>can really relate to both sides of it, and feel each person's character<BR>pretty deeply.  and to think.. the script was written by a North Carolina<BR>Bible Belt Girl.. :)  What do you know?<BR>This film is definitely worth watching, and buying.. If you are remotely interested in the kink.. Even if you are just wanting a titillating film to watch occasionally.. it is worth the purchase price.. Great film!  Realistic to some degree. :) <BR>Bout time, is all I can say
B000002BSG|5.0|This is a very great albumn! I heard the song on the Digital Cable Music channels when I found out my mom had this CD. I listened to it, and fell in love with it right away. Although, what's weird is that the CD I have doesn't have track 14, &quot;Funktion&quot;. I don't know if that's a mistake, or if you can only get that song on the British Albumn, but oh well! The rest of the songs make up for it ^_^
B000066NW0|1.0|This album is sped up bubble gum pop at it's worst. I listened to this cd expecting to listen to some good pop rock but was dissapointed when all I heard were songs that could have made some singles for Britney Spears if they were slightly toned down. The song \\"Unwanted\\" is especially laughable. You can hear her trying to sing with an edge and fail miserably. The lyrics are so inane (when Lavigne sings \\"take of your preppy clothes,\\" is she talking to herself? Even Aaron Carter and the Backstreet Boys dress more like \\"rock stars\\" though in no way I am implying they are. Another annoyance is the credits for the songs. Lavigne keeps saying she wrote the songs but in the credits it says they're co-wtitten by her and professional song writers. Even Nsync does that. I would give Let Go zero stars but unfortunately amazon doesn't have that option.
B00007CVSH|4.0|I bought this just to give Jose Cura a chance as Manrico. I am afraid he disappointed me. He was too much as a brute, in addition to the wobbly singing. Dmitri Hvorostovsky's Count on the other hand is wonderful from start to finish. His acting as well as his singing is exemplary. The only thing that was intrusive was the sword fighting with Cura. It intruded much too much on the singing. <br />Veronica Villaroel's Leonora too was very good. Her acting and singing were blended very nicely. Yvonne Naef's Azucena was also good, but I thought she lacked the bite of Simionato's or Cossotto's interpretation of the vengeful gypsy. <br />I would have to say that Dmitri Hvorostovsky was the star here. This seemed for me to be a Trovatore without the Trovatore. Cura's wobbly voice was too much of a instrution for me enjoy the opera fully. The fact that he acted and sang like a brute and not like a passionate poet, as I see Manrico, may be the fault of the director of the production. The production was OK, but I'd would much prefer a traditional setting for this opera. But on the other hand the sets and costumes were consistant and better than other production of opera nowadays. <br />Carlo Rizzi's conducting was crisp and exciting. Overall is this performance good, if you can accept Manrico to be a wobbly brute. The picture on this DVD is very good with it's 16:9 image. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound too is good, but it would be even better if the producers of the DVD would do the same as DG and added a DTS track. But it is very good nonetheless.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|i was hoping to get a new, fresh, insanely catchy sound from godsmack with their latest release, faceless.  boy was i let down.  i have only listened to this cd one time, and i have no desire to hear it again.  one of the songs (needless to say i forgot which one because they all sound equally as boring) almost sounds exactly  like the transition part of &quot;awake&quot; from their previous release.  i love every song on their last cd and i was expecting something equally as good as that, but they didn't deliver.  don't get me wrong, they still have some pretty catchy parts on this cd, but mostly during their instrumental transitions.  it's almost as if every song on this cd followed a formula (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, instrumental break, then chorus).  it gets pretty boring at times, and it isn't worth owning.  it might be worth burning from a friend.  you'd be better off buying the new justin timberlake cd.
B000002HEM|5.0|I've followed 10,000 Maniacs since I saw them at a bar in New Orleans in 1986.  I like most all that they've done, but this recording has to be one of my favorite.
B00000DR5D|5.0|Ricochet (part two) must be the best track tangerine dream have ever made! it starts with a beautiful piano tune and building up to a massive and fast synthesized driven melody!(and remember one thing..this is 1975-76!) Then it fades out into a railway wasteland, just to get built up another time to another great tune. You may call this track an epic..or ricochet?...when you think that this is it,it just hit you in the forehead once again and you are hooked! On part one you can take part in the train journey down the lane of imaginations! The fantastic trio of baumann\froese\franke has made a live album wich will stand out as a milestone for the genre they invented!!
B00006JJ1O|3.0|I personally like the album, but since I didn't want to spend my money on something I might end up not liking, I downloaded all the songs and listened to them one at a time. Most of them are pretty good, but some I can just be without. If you like dance/pop, be my guest and buy it. But if you hear it on the radio and skip it unless it's &quot;the only song on&quot;, then I suggest you stay clear from this CD.
B00003CXAA|5.0|You know how people say that sequels aren't as good as the first movies? Well that isn't true in this case. If you haven't seen any of The Godfather movies, I highly reccomend it. They are definitely my favorite movies.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I've seen all 10 films; this was one of the best, but it suffered from a slow and talky middle. I actually fell asleep briefly during those segments! And, the story itself is cribbed more than a little from \\"Wrath of Khan\\". A LOT of similarities. Tom Hardy was not convincing as a Picard clone. Lacked the charisma and gravitas of Patrick Stewart. The Data story was pointless and a distraction from the main story. The look of the film was outstanding. Special effects, set design and makeup were all top-notch and convincing.
B00008AWOD|3.0|Album art indicative of contents.  Barren, cold, austere, off-putting.  But a certain grace surrounds it all.  Not my favorite Placebo album at all but a good half-dozen cuts are pretty outstanding nonetheless.  It's like the band's trying too hard here to produce \\"art\\" rather than just writing good songs.  Maybe the production gets in the way too with waves of distortion undermining otherwise worthy efforts.  This band still hasn't nailed it yet and when they do icons will fall.  Image is nothing.  Strip it down fellas and find that muse and let it reign.  Still, one of the ten best \\"big\\" bands in the world right now.

B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin in the rain is most definitely one of my favorite movies. It is a really fun movie to watch, even if you aren't a big fan of musicals. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds are a great trio in this movie. I have seen it at least 20 times and it never gets old. I highly reccomend it!
0930289234|4.0|Watchmen was a groundbreaker when it first appeared as a limited series back in 1986-87. Alan Moore got back down to Earth after his incredible headtripping work on Swamp Thing, and here deals with the private lives of superheroes. In this saga the heroics of the main characters are merely a vague backdrop, while the everyday relationships that they share with other humans are the core of the story. Not unlike the Uncanny X-Men overhaul in the mid-70's, the Watchmen series presents very human &quot;heroes&quot; with very human problems, in a real society that has ambiguous opinions about costumed heroes and villains. Insightfully, Moore adds corporate and governmental manipulation of heroes to the mix as well. A key part of the Watchmen saga is the traditionalist artwork of Dave Gibbons, with a no-nonsense and basic construction of the pages. There is not a single non-rectangular frame in the entire Watchmen saga, and Gibbons' retro style adds to the human feeling of the story. The only weaknesses here include heavy 80's-style Cold War paranoia as the conflict behind the story, which bogs the story down with political moralizing that is getting a bit outdated. Meanwhile, in graphic novel form, the story drags toward soap opera territory in several spots, as the suspense was constructed to work better in the form of twelve separate issues originally. Even so, Watchmen still deserves to be treated as a classic in the art of graphic storytelling.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Meteora is without a doubt a work of inspiration. It came from hard work and dedication to the music and it really shows through with this CD. While sticking to their Nu-Metal Genre, Linkin Park has made the best CD ever. It has incredible flow, in both the instrumental parts and vocals; it has words that connect to the listener and is just over all a very enlightening CD. I would highly recommend this to any person with ears.
038572179X|2.0|NINE chapters before the 'incident' actually occurs.  I almost threw the book out the window.<BR>The last half was certainly more interesting than the first but I'm not sure it was worth the aggravation of getting there.  Don't waste your money on a hardcover.
B000002H72|5.0|Doolittle is an alltime rock classic. Forget who they influenced and how important they were. Just sit back and enjoy the insane rollercoaster ride. Songs such as 'Tame' and 'No. 13 baby' have to be heard to be beleived. Whenever this album finds its way into my cd player it stays there for a loooonnng time, i have to pry it out with all my will, it's too damn addictive.
B000002WAD|4.0|Rick Astley was yet another client of the 1980's Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum pop hit machine like Kylie Minogue and Bananarama.  His debut, Whenever You Need Somebody, yielded three hit singles including \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" and its equally infectious twin \\"Together Forever.\\"  But despite their sound, Astley was a talented vocalist from the start.  Imagine Tear For Fears's Roland Orzabal lightening up but losing the falsetto-that's Rick Astley.<br />That S-A-W disco sound meshed with the strings-synthesizer really enhanced Astley in his #1 hit single \\"Never Gonna Give You Up.\\"  It sounds like a real utopian promise for girls:  \\"Never gonna give you up/never gonna tell a lie/never gonna break your heart and desert you.\\"  Ditto \\"Together Forever\\", which despite sounding so much like the previous song, deserves special mention of its own.  Anyone wanting an upbeat wedding song should play this:  \\"Together forever and never to pass/Together forever with two/And don't you know I would move heaven and earth/to be together forever with you.\\"  Awwwwww, isn't that sweet?<br />The engaging title track is a cousin of Bananarama's \\"I Heard A Rumour,\\" though without the splashy oomph of the trio.  The third single, \\"It Would Take A Strong Strong Man\\" veers into 70's soul like Aaron Neville or Barry White.  How does he feel about this woman?  Take the words of the title, then add \\"to ever let you go.\\"<br />If  the couple wed to \\"Together Forever\\" ended up on the skids, they could play \\"The Love Has Gone\\" in the divorce lawyer's office.  Despite the usual backbeat, Rick displays a slightly subdued tone and small wonder.  He also displays a unique pinched sound at a lower register.<br />\\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" returns to that lively burst of sound and it does offer some source of hope that the previous song doesn't:  \\"Time has made us strangers, maybe we can't go on/but if love can take the changes/don't say goodbye girl.\\"<br />\\"Slipping Away\\" continues the pace and has some brass in it.  \\"No More Looking For Love\\" has some soulful backing vocalists and Rick's lower register.  \\"You Move Me\\" is a disheartening song about a man who loses his dead-end job and wonders what went wrong, but at least he has his girl.  The album ends with the Nat King Cole standard \\"When I Fall in Love,\\" proving that he does ballads well.  For further proof, there's \\"Cry For Help\\" from his Free album.<br />A good start from Astley, whose last gasp of greatness would be his contribution to Elton John's Lion King song, but hey, if Kylie Minogue can make a comeback, why can't he?rass in it.  \\"No More Looking For Love\\" has some soulful backing vocalists and Rick's lower register.  \\"You Move Me\\" is a disheartening song about a man who loses his dead-end job and wonders what went wrong, but at least he has his girl.

B00008OLIC|5.0|If anyone has ever listened to the Crue then they know there are two distinct era's.  The first is the Too fast for Love/Shout at the Devil era and then the Dr.Feelgood era.  My favorite is the Dr.Feelgood era only because I think the songs are better produced.  Bob Rock did a magnificent job on this album despite the bands imminent implosion.  I recently bought this again because I lost my old cd, but this one also offers new bonus tracks adding some incentive.  If you like Motley Crue this is a good place to start.
0440224764|4.0|This book gets off to a fabulous start.  We meet Patrick Lanigan, a southern attorney who ripped off his corrupt law partners for [a large sum of money]and escaped the country, started a new life and found true love.  After year's of being tracked, he is caught, tortured and returned to America to face justice (in many forms).<br />The story of his original escape (including committing murder...or did he?) is fascinating, and the book hums along for a long time.  His secrets are slowly revealed, and we grow in sympathy for him as we grow in our dislike for his opponents.<br />Grisham keeps things moving along nicely, and the first 75% of the book zooms by enjoyably.  But towards the end, we realize Lanigan has planned things SO carefully that virtually all suspense is drained.  We sense how things are going to turn out, and all we get to do then is watch our expectations play out quite predictably.  Much like Grishams THE RUNAWAY JURY, Grisham drains too much suspense from the proceedings by stacking the deck so highly in favor of the hero.  And there really isn't a true climax for that reason, so we don't get to expel any pent up tension, and the book leaves us with a dissatisfied feeling.<br />I still recommend it, though.  It's short enough that we don't actually feel \\"cheated\\" by the less than thrilling conclusion, we just wish it could have been more.  The characters are still enjoyable, and we get to genuinely like some of the players, especially Lanigan and his attorney (and old friend), Sandy.  Don't expect this book to be the \\"be all and end all\\" and you'll be fine.  It's also easy reading and pretty clean (except for some extramarital shennanigans by Patrick's wife), and might make a nice book for a youth (15 or so) looking to make a foray into adult popular fiction.
B000002L7J|5.0|\\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is the Smiths album that receives the most praise, perhaps rightfully so, and \\"Meat Is Murder\\" is the album which tends to be seen as their weakest (when the NME writers recently compiled their list of the 100 Best Albums of All Time this was the only Smiths album that did not make the list). However, it is still an excellent achievement with only the final two songs letting it down somewhat as they go on far too long unnecessarily repeating themselves over and over. It is easily their rockiest album overall as \\"The Headmaster Ritual,\\" \\"I Want The One I Can't Have,\\" \\"What She Said\\" and others show, yet it also contains two of the most incredibly beautiful songs they ever did in \\"Well I Wonder\\" and \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" (the latter being my all-time favorite Smiths song).

B00008H2LB|3.0|The first 3 songs are really good, but then the album kind of falls off.  There are several other songs worth listening to, but overall I was very disappointed with Meteora.  Way too short, barely over 1/2 hour.  And most of it sounds the same or just lame.   LP shows no growth as a group with Meteora.  They just stuck to the same formula but seemed to run out of ideas both lyrically and musically.  After making a classic with Hybrid Theory, and a great remix album, it seems that LP rushed in making this album to satisfy it's fans.  Maybe 15 and 16 year olds will give this album 5 stars and buy anything LP puts out, but this fan is very disappointed.  LP better come correct next time around before they fall off and be remembered as a one album wonder.
0805066691|5.0|I have read some other books on the American Indians, but I must say that this is the most complete volume of their destruction that I have read.  Not only does it give you a destruction time line, but also it does it in a very well written and gripping fashion. The author writes as best he can from the Indians viewpoint and I think this helps the reader get a better grasp of the pain the Indians went through.  I knew it was a wonderfully written book by the fact that the pages just kept flowing, I never found myself slowed down or bored.  It is just page after page of the US government taking advantage and overrunning the American Indians.  The one constant it highlights is that the group with the most power can justify any crime, no matter how egregious in their name.<br />In the book the authors detail how a common phase came about in America, \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian\\".  I have heard that statement before but it did not mean much to me.  Now after reading about the constant pressure the Americans put on the Indians and the disgusting about of violence, it has far more meaning.  When you read a book like this you just keep asking yourself how can people commit these crimes against women and children?  The author has also dug up a number of photos of the Indians he details which makes it even more power to see the people that were so aggressively destroyed.  A wonderful book that every American should read to make sure we know the real history of the country.

B000083E79|4.0|Yest, this is the very best of Cher however, this almost duplicates two other greatest hits collections. First there is \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\" from 1999 and \\"Cher-Greatest Hits (imported from Australia) also from 1999.<BR>Here are a few differences. <BR>She has the original version of Bang-Bang (unlike the version from the 80's). Two songs (Song for The Lonely & A Different Kind of Love Song-remixed) from her \\"Living Proof\\" cd. There is also the dance remix of One By One. <BR>Even though this stuff has been repeated, it is nice to just hear her sing again. Her cd pictures are always interesting to look at (she looks great as a blonde) and the liner notes always have something good to say.<BR>If you are a die hard Cher fan, this is for you. I love her and I love her music. <BR>Rock on DIVA!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Can you believe it in 2003 an album worthy of being called of heavy metal. Complete with guitar solos and minus turntables,senseless screaming,techno beats or whining.If you love the modern metal formula like disturbed,korn or system of a down you will HATE this album. If you like the heavy metal and Alice In Chains and you dont mind a cheap AIC knockoff you will like this album. Faceless is no Facelift but standing next to the other rock of today its pretty good
038572179X|5.0|This is an engaging story and so finely written that the reading is both effortless and seductive. After I had finished (that is, after drying my eyes and regaining my breath), I was amazed to realize how complex a plot it is considering how smoothly it is told. By far, it is the best book I have read in years.<br />The story starts on a summer day at a large country estate in pre-WWII England. For anyone who delights in the heady mix of intelligence, innocence and youthful imagination, the beginning is like eating rich chocolate: 13 year old Briony has written a play -- the references to Austen, Burney, and family performances within 18th century lore are abundant and perfect -- to be rehearsed and performed by her unwilling and displaced visiting cousins in order to celebrate her brother's return to home with his sophisticated friend. However, reheasals in the playroom for THE TRIALS OF ARABELLA (of course) do not run smoothly: the twins boys do not understand what is expected of them; there's tension between Briony and 15 year old Lola. During the hot summer afternoon, Briony looks out the window to see her older sister Cecilia and Robbie, the cleaning lady's son, having what looks like some kind of menacing (and intimate) interaction in the fountain. The rest of the day's events and mishaps play out without implication until nightfall when a real crime of a sexual nature occurs and Briony's overactive imagination and lack of sophistication lead her to make a accusation which results in genuine tragedy for everyone. Without revealing the entire plot and overwhelming descriptions of war and survival, Briny spends her life paying for this mistake. Near the end of her long life, and having enjoyed without enjoyment a successful writing career, Briony's birthday is celebrated by her relations. This party is held at the old country house, now a renovated hotel, where her grand nieces and nephews perform THE TRIALS OF ARABELLA, a deeply emotional and incomprehensible experience for all (the surviving twin boy, now an old man, breaks down completely, as will nearly every reader). <br />This book goes into my unofficial rank as one of the best reading experiences I've ever had. It tooks me days to shake the feeling that Briony was a part of my life. I was completely transported and I don't think there can be better praise than that.
0316666343|1.0|I bought this book because it was one of the bestsellers in the bookstore and thought it must be something very good.  But it turned out to be very disappointing.  I even thought of giving up reading it when I have gone through just one-third of it.  But I decided to read further, thinking (and hoping) that the story may become more interesting.  I'm now nearly through the book and find the development as boring as it has been at the beginning.  The description of the characters and the incidents are too long yet too shallow to touch my heart.  The author tries hard to show how much the family loves their lost Susie and especially, how desperate the father has become.  The impact on me is unfortunately far from successful.  Just a lengthy description without feelings doesn't work.  The book is too boring for me to recommend further.
B000002UAO|2.0|Although there are some good tracks here, Think for Yourself, Word, Wait, Run for Your Life, What Goes On, and You Won't See Me aren't exactly chart toppers, and they comprise about half the album.  <br />Alternatively, Norwegian Wood, In My Life, and I'm Looking Through You help to salvage this effort. An honest evaluation says this is a 2-star effort at best.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Well what can I say? This album is GREAT! It took a couple of listenings to, but it's definately a grower. A fantastic mix top tracks which really demonstrate what a talented and gifted artist he is. The lyrics are clever and witty and his vocals are tops. I really hope he starts to get the credit he deserves over here soon. Can't wait until the Summer when I'm heading over to Blighty for his tour! YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ALBUM!...
6305428298|4.0|This unusual film is difficult to characterize -- the characters are so well-developed, so unique, so interesting.  Michael Caine is wonderful, but I thought that LV's mother & her tagalong friend, silent Sadie, stole the show.  LV's mother is a loud, middle-aged floozy who wears pushup bras, micromini skirts, towering heels & lace tightsn and prattles on nonstop in a barely decipherable accent and odd syntax (I kept the subtitles on during the entire film -- a big help.)  Her best friend Sadie is a chubby, funny-faced follower who never speaks -- the mother babbles nonstop & no one else has a chance to get a word in edgewise.  LV is her mother's opposite -- a plain-jane, retiring type, silent, expressing herself only through the voices and words of the divas on her treasured record albums, finding solace in the framed portrait of her deceased father.  The plot keeps you on edge, but all is resolved positively in the end.  As an added bonus, Jane Horrocks (LV) is, in fact, an incredible performer, able to mimic everyone from Judy Garland in Wizard Oz to Marilyn Monroe singing \\"Happy Birthday.\\"
B000066NW0|4.0|When I got the cd a while ago I REALLY liked it. As they started to play the songs on the radio more and more it got really annoying hearing all of the same songs on my favorite cd everyday about 10 times. Im sure after they stop playing the songs on the radio it will be a better cd to listen to.

6301236947|2.0|One thing you can count on in a movie about U2 is good music. I saw them play at Largo, MD's now-demolished Cap Center (the one in \\"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\\") in early '85. While not at their musical peak, their passion and generosity were astounding. They turned around and sang to those of us unlucky enough to be seated behind the stage, and when bouncers tried to clear kids from the pit, Bono angrily confronted them. This got them banned from the venue, but to do anything else would not have been U2. They weren't chart-toppers then, but my college was full of their fans: earnest, clean-cut boys with a taste for social causes and a cultlike fervor for the band. And no wonder; their songs were bursts of rapt sincerity in an age of jaded techno-pop. The guitar may have sounded a bit like PiL on uppers, but such lyricism and raw emotion were almost unheard of in pop music.<br />I loved what I saw and heard. But there's an adage that every man is really three men: the one that others see, the one in the mirror, and the one inside. With \\"Rattle and Hum\\" U2 try to show us version two, and unintentionally give us a load of version three...to our lasting dismay.<br />Scene by scene, reel by reel, we watch their illusory greatness crumble. Phil Joanou's pompous camerawork, complete with artsy slo-mo and affected graininess, plays off their Olympian gestures to ludicrous effect. I'm sorry, but weren't we first drawn to U2 by their *lack* of murk and dour pretension? Their down-to-earth idealism is precisely what made them stand out. By ramming Ambience down our faces, Joanou buries the band's chief virtue.<br />And that's before we hear from U2 themselves. In the interview scenes the band does nothing but giggle and snort between mumbled cliches like \\"It's a musical journey.\\" Commentary that could have been telling is instead coy, smug, and inscrutable. Weirder still is a scene where Bono leads a young Gospel choir in a version of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", maybe his most narcissistic song. The power disparity is unnerving: Bono comes off almost as a plantation-era taskmaster, waving a ferule, and you can't help but wonder what these Harlem kids are thinking. Do any of them actually like this music? Have they bonded in any way with the band, and how do they relate to this tycoon's self-satisfied angst? There seems no point to the scene beyond flogging the band's playskool liberalism.<br />But the worst clip, where their insular idealism chafes hardest with reality, is the version of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\". This was filmed one day after an IRA bomb killed eleven people, and Bono sounds justifiably furious. But context makes this version ghastly: during a swelling guitar solo he lectures us about the uprising in Northern Ireland: \\"(This is) a revolution that the majority of my countrymen do not support...(Screw) the Revolution.\\"<br />Sincere words no doubt, but U2 are also using the emotional clout of real tragedy to add extra oomph to a musical bridge. You can totally hear it: they're too slick a bunch of showmen to keep from pumping Bono's sermon into an arena-rock crescendo. (Couldn't he have given this speech between songs?) I know art and politics are inseparable, but when torn flesh and pop are woven together so blatantly and glibly you just get squalor. Almost like an Andrew Lloyd Webber Broadway fantasia about My Lai.<br />Even stripped of their pompous score, Bono's words are a misstep. His \\"countrymen\\" are Irish, so why should they decide the fate of Northern Ireland? The two are completely different countries, and Dublin has as much to do with Belfast as Timbuktu. Also, he seems oblivious of the connotations of telling Americans to \\"(Screw) the Revolution\\". Screwing revolutions isn't something we take lightly; for decades we've tried to crush every popular uprising that ran afoul of our plans for global finance, whether in Chile, Colombia, East Timor or Vietnam. Honestly, Bono, we need no encouragement.<br />The songs are mostly good, though the band's view of themselves as Protean Oracles from the Celtic Mists kills a lot of the pleasure. One exception is the abysmal cover of \\"Helter Skelter\\", introduced thusly by the ever-humble Bono: \\"Charles Manson stole this song from the Beatles, and now we're stealing it back!\\"<br />The grim fact is that Goths will still be creepy-crawling to the original at their Manson-themed raves long after U2's albums have landed in the cut-out bins. What Revolution was that?The songs are mostly good, though the band's view of themselves as Protean Oracles from the Celtic Mists kills a lot of the pleasure.

B00008J2DQ|4.0|Starting with sounds of war - volleys of bullets popping, men yelling, explosions, and a chopper flying - open up the album with the amazing \\"Straight Out of Line\\", much like the classic Metallica song \\"One\\". After this a blazing riff opens up the great title track \\"Faceless\\" before moving on to another good song \\"Changes\\" with an extended guitar part and an extended classic Sully scream. The rest of the 47 minutes that makes up the album is usual Godsmack, some tracks (\\"Dead and Broken\\", \\"I Am\\") echo \\"Mistakes\\" and \\"Forgive Me\\" off the 2nd album. The standout track is my personal favorite \\"I Stand Alone\\" which ive liked since The Scorpion King Soundtrack came out. Other highlights include the last two tracks \\"The Awakening\\" a tribal tune reminicient of \\"Voodoo\\" on the 1st album and \\"The Journey\\"/\\"Spiral\\" on the 2nd...and the acoustic/conga drum epic \\"Serenity\\"<BR>Great stuff
B00008CLOA|4.0|Before April 9th of this year I swear to you I had never once heard Dark Side of the Moon all the way through, only hearing Time multiple times on the radio, and Us and Them, Brain Damage and Eclipse once on the radio as well, but that was it. I was never even familiar with Money which everyone keeps on saying the whole world is familiar with, lol. But after hearing so much good stuff about this album I decided that I needed to buy it for myself and see just what was so good about it, and after hearing it multiple times, all I can say is that Dark Side is a very good addictive album with Time standing out from the crowd, but overall other albums are just better than it. It is definitely worth buying though. Just don't call it the greatest album ever, okay?
B0000033WC|5.0|In the opinion of many, this album is considered the &quot;best&quot; work of the Velvet Underground, or at least the most popular. I see the latter as true, for most people who are &quot;turned on&quot; to the Velvets are drawn in by its uniqueness, but are not scared off by any frightening avant-garde acoustical assaults. The classic rock feel of &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, and even &quot;Oh, Sweet Nothing&quot; are practically an invitation to explore the album more without fear.<br />All of thhis makes for a good album for a beginning VU listener; however, for people who enjoy the earlier albums and thier artistry, it may be a touch boring and, dare I say, &quot;poppy&quot;. With the exception of &quot;New Age&quot;, and even that is a stretch, there is not much in the way of an &quot;indie&quot; sound to the album, which sounds more like the work of Lou and record producer looking for a hit to (finally) put the VU on the map, and less like the earlier Reed/Cale collaborations that drove the Beatniks and Pop Musicians of then and the stoners of today wild. While this does not lessen the excellent quality of the semi-independent (by this point) New York sound, it is not what many expect from the Underground from thier earlier works.<br />While they are still Velvet, this album certanly makes them look a lot less Underground, which certanly makes this an ideal &quot;first album&quot; to suggest to VU-Virgins. Either way, still an excellent album.
B000002LHX|5.0|This soundtrack is what turned me on to Prince, the same as The Labyrinth turned me on to Bowie. Both artists are incredibly theatrical and original, and Prince definately shows it here. I've been listening to this album since it came out in 1989, and I've loved it the whole time. Probably my favorite track on the album is \\"Electric Chair\\", but it's going to be different for everyone who listens.<br />  Overall, this album has a definate funk feel, but since it was for the movie Batman, Prince pulled away from the blatant sexuality. Don't worry, it's still there, but this time it's on a more subtle level, and I actually think the lyrics for this album were extremely clever and the tunes original.<br />  A must for any Prince fan, and if you just dig the movie, that's cool, too.
B000002J20|3.0|This 81 minute double album could easily have been edited down to one 45 minute album which would have been a more worthy follow up to the stellar Close to the Edge. Great moments but way too much filler (like almost all of track 3). Still worth having, especially the remastered edition.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Okay LP fans...if you haven't bought the group's new cd yet, you may want to read this first.<BR>If you love the hypnotic crooning of Chester, you won't be sorry when you buy this cd. (Guilty!!)  The new cd is packed with his haunting voice, much unlike their debut, Hybrid Theory.<BR>However, if you prefer the rhyming and mixing side of Linkin Park, you might wanna preview he album first.  True, there are raps on the cd, don't worry, but only bits and pieces, save for Hahn's mix on #12 &quot;Session&quot;.  For the most part, you hear the vibrations of the bass, guitar, drums, and yes, even a Japanese flute (#11, Nobody's Listening--a personal favorite).<BR>Honestly, the band has matured over the year and a half they wrote these songs and have begun to define themselves more as alternative/punk than the hip hop and pop beat the boys received off their first album.  True Lnkin Park fans, I can promise you you won't be disappointed in the new album!
B00004R99L|5.0|Right from the stunning (hand drawn!) opening sweep of a verdant riverbank on a lazy summer's day, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beautifully animated of the Disney films of the 1950s. Unfortunately, this film has always been one of the most maligned in the Disney canon.<br />Many books on the subject of Disney's animated films will often only devote a paragraph or two to the film, and in that short paragraph it will invariably mention how \\"Alice\\" was a financial flop, how Walt Disney himself wasn't very fond of it, how it's a chilly film. I don't find this film chilly, I find it refreshingly free of sentiment or cliche that can often weigh down other Disney films.<br />To start with, we have Alice. Unlike Cinderella or Snow White, Alice has a lot of personality. Who among us hasn't been very frustrated that Cinderella just took all the abuse from her stepmother and sisters and was powerless?  Alice, on the other hand, is not one of the \\"shy little violets\\" and operates on more than just one emotion;  she gets mad, befuddled, disgusted, amused, angry and, best of all, she stands up to adults (how odd for the 50's) and tells them when they are being ridiculous. This film has a subversiveness that may have been unintentional in showing how the world of adults, with its rules and logic, can be purely nonsense and that a child can be the only sane person in the lot. (To be fair, this sentiment is in keeping with Lewis Carroll's original books.)<br />Alice is beautifully voiced by Kathryn Beaumont (who did a similarly excellent job as the voice of Wendy in \\"Peter Pan\\" a few years after.) The real appeal of Alice here is that unlike many other Disney heroines,Kathryn Beaumont was a young girl when she recorded the voice and therefore, Alice looks and sounds like a girl of a certain age.  Contrast that to Mary Costa's voice and the animated figure of Sleeping Beauty who looks as if she could be a 1950s pinup model despite only being 16.<br />The story itself is a wild trip through an ever shifting dreamscape most notable for the wild color schemes that anticipate the 1960's motifs. This is not implying that \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one big drug reference; it is not. Many people who worked on this film have commented that it felt like the film was getting away from them, that the characters took on lives of their own. This is evident as the film just gets wilder and wilder as it goes on with the introductions of the most bizarre and colorful characters Disney ever brought to life.<br />The only real flaws in the film include a scene when Alice breaks down and berates herself for never following her own advice, this moment stops the film cold in the middle of what has been a non-stop thrill ride.  The extremely abrupt ending of the film is a very strange choice. I think even an extra 20-30 seconds between Alice and her sister at the conclusion of the film would have made the film a little stronger.<br />The DVD has some interesting extras, but again, I feel that the Disney studios still do not have a high regard for this film and just threw it together on DVD. I have heard that the LaserDisc version had many more interesting extras, and it would be my hope for this film to get a rerelease on DVD with some more extras restored.a wild trip through an ever shifting dreamscape most notable for the wild color schemes that anticipate the 1960's motifs.

B00008BLB8|5.0|For the new Caught in the Act reissue, one of the greatest live albums of all time, they still didn't get it right--contrary to what the liner notes say. Musically, the album is still outstanding. Everyone in the band serves up an inspired performance, and overall, it sounds great (then again, the original album never sounded bad). Don Brewer's drum solo on \\"T.N.U.C.\\" has been restored, but elsewhere, all is not well. There are a number of things that keep me from raving about this CD. <br />First of all, let's talk about the transition from \\"Closer to Home\\" into \\"Heartbreaker.\\" On the original album, \\"Closer to Home\\" faded out to end the first side. Side two faded back up with the end of \\"Closer to Home\\" and went straight into \\"Heartbreaker\\" (the actual performance featured a seamless transition from one song into the other). Anyone with a good ear can hear exactly where they tried to mix the two songs together. While better than it's been (this is at least the third time Capitol has released Caught in the Act on CD), it still isn't as good as it should be. Not only is there an audible space between the two songs, the treble actually drops on \\"Heartbreaker.\\"<br />Secondly, there's the matter of editing. Rather than mixing the songs where necessary, they're crossfaded instead. Mixing in this case involves basically overlaying the end of one track with the start of another, while keeping the volume level the same. Crossfading is similar to mixing; only the end of the `first' track fades down while the start of the `second' track fades up. This is most noticeable on the intro to \\"Black Licorice,\\" where part of the vocal intro is actually missing. The liner notes mention that some of the applause between tracks was cut to let everything fit on one CD. Considering the fact that there's almost a full minute of usable space left on the CD, it makes one wonder why they felt the need to do this. <br />Thirdly, they left off the first song played at the shows on the tour, \\"Are You Ready.\\" The liner notes say that Capitol originally didn't want to include it because it was on the band's first live album (the band was having problems with the label at the time). Again, due to space restrictions and wanting to keep it to a single CD, the song was left off once again.<br />Lastly, there's the matter of the album's original first track, simply entitled \\"Introduction.\\" The liner notes mention the fact that it was on the original album, but that it was left off to keep everything on one CD, but it's available as an unlisted bonus track on \\"one of the discs that `supposedly' has no bonus tracks.\\" (Editor's note: \\"Introduction\\" has never appeared on CD before). Granted, it's mainly just applause, with a bit of the band jamming on \\"Rock and Roll Soul\\" before they go onstage. This was expendable. The thing that makes no sense is why they put it at the end of the new CD. It's completely out of context. <br />What they should've done with Caught in the Act is release the entire show on two CDs instead of one--including \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Are You Ready,\\" and mix \\"Closer to Home\\" into \\"Heartbreaker\\" properly. (assuming they're from two different shows--no source information is listed). Maybe next time. Meanwhile, despite all the gripes above, it's still a great CD.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is an excellent record.  To me, this has become the best record of 2003 from the very first listen.  It's got the power, raw energy and great musicianship that sadly seems to be lacking in today's music.  They are definitely a band that has established themselves as a rock solid outfit.  They're great live too.  I recommend this release highly.  Faceless will be a great summer driving record!
B00008BLAS|5.0|Shinin' On was the second album that studio wizard (and a true star) Todd Rundgren produced. Sound quality is excellent throughout--much better than the worn out vinyl copy I've been listening to for years. The disc includes two bonus tracks, the bluesy \\"Destitute and Losin'\\" (originally released as the b-side to \\"The Loco-Motion\\" and later available on the Thirty Years of Funk compilation) and an alternate version of the title track with a different vocal arrangement. The only thing missing is the 3D glasses that came with the original album. With songs like the title track, \\"Gettin' Over You\\" and \\"Little Johnny Hooker,\\" Shinin' On is one of the band's best albums.
B000088E6D|5.0|A slick cd, smooth vocals. I found myself Swaying long after listening to his Sway! Both my sisters and my parents would be considered serious jazz lovers, but after hearing this cd are now confirmed Bubl fans. <BR>There's something on this cd for everyone and it's so nice to see<BR>new life being given to some great songs. I just loved it!
B00008BXJF|4.0|This first time I listened to this CD, I was convinced that the Crims had run out of ideas. Over half of the songs have been previously released on various CDs and EPs, and the earlier versions (at least upon first hearing the new ones) were better. I'm sitting here listening to the CD now for the fourth time, and I must admit, in the proper context (read: not comparing it to the earlier CDs), I'm enjoying the CD a lot more. <br />The title track appears in four places on the CD, in varying forms, beginning with the a cappella version. From there it bursts into \\"Level Five\\"--one of the many tracks on the CD that made its first appearance onstage during the 2001 tour, as well as the band's tour disc of the same name. In fact, the basic track for the song was recorded live--you can hear the applause at the end. Musically, the instrumental song bears a strong resemblance to \\"VROOOM\\" from the band's 1995 album, THRAK.<br />Up next is \\"Eyes Wide Open.\\" An acoustic version of this one appeared on last year's Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With EP. It's nice to hear the `non-acoustic' version. \\"ElektriK\\" is another instrumental that was played on the last tour. Aside from some additional electronic percussion, the song is nearly identical to the earlier versions.<br />\\"Facts of Life\\" is a throwaway vocal tune (one of the few songs with vocals on the disc), as is \\"Happy With...\\" The latter was bad enough on last year's EP. Why they chose to include again here is beyond me. \\"The Power to Believe II\\" and \\"Dangerous Curves\\" both made their debut on the Level Five tour. However, \\"TPTB II\\" has gone by other names in its previous incarnations--first \\"Cyriel\\" and then later, it became known as \\"Virtuous Circle.\\" The only real difference now is that it has the TPTB vocals in a few places. Musically, it's basically the same as before.<br />The disc ends on a quiet note with \\"The Power to Believe IV: Coda\\"--a typical Fripp soundscape with the TPTB vocal floating over the top. All said, The Power to Believe isn't a great disc, but it's not bad either. Especially if you've seen the band on tour recently.
0316666343|4.0|I rated &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold a nine out of ten because, it was written in a way I had read before. It was a girl who had gone to heaven and was watching her family, friends, and the search for her body. It was somewhat hard to read because, even though the book is fictional you could not imagine how hard it would be to cope up in heaven or down on earth. I reccomend this book  for any one who likes to see the world in a different way, good or bad.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Godsmack Has succeeded once again!!!<br />This album is more powerfuly yet melodical.<br />Faceless is an album to pick up this spring if you enjoyed \\"straight out of line\\"<br />You are probably reading this wondering what is better 13 bucks or Faceless.<br />Godsmack's new album delivers intense velocity as well as outstanding instrument work. You may think sully's voice gets a little frustrating after a while but not on this album. Sully's growling vocals become enchanting in this metal masterpiece. On songs like \\"Serenity\\" very reminiscent to \\"voodoo\\" and songs like \\"I stand alone \\" and \\"faceless\\" and \\"realign\\" the vocal work is great so buy this album its really worth the 13 bucks. If you are a big fan of godsmack you will be thrilled as the band evolved from their previous albums.<BR>the album did not get 5 stars because of the following:<BR>the album lacked replay value. It gets repetitve after a few listens and you have to wait a few days then listen again. The album lacked the great lyrics that appeared on the first album. quote \\"I F***** hate you! Youre such a Liar!! Cause I want to Hate you!\\"<BR>well there you have it <BR>overall the album is very good heavy yet melodical. Godsmack quotes in guitar world \\"We're energy rock!\\"
B00005JLWN|5.0|This is a great movie no matter what other critics say.  When it was released critics gave it bad reviews except for a few.  The concept behind the movie is great, those other critics don't know what they are missing.  It is very Matrix esque, but is much better in my opinion.  The story is very compelling, and it is full of action.  Anyone who likes action movies should see this.  Gun-kata is so awesome.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne, at 18, has done more in her career than many older artists! She co-writes all of her songs and plays the music (with a little help, of course, unless she is super-talented and can play the drums, guitars, and bass all simultaneoulsy! Tee hee!) herself. <br />Avril is an admirable character in my opinion. Sure she's kinda gothic, but at least she doesn't go about showing off her \\"perfect\\" bod in a skimpy little mini-dress like *some* of those pop-princesses out there. Avril is not afraid to be herself. I once read an article about Avril where she said, \\"I'm out to sell my music, not my body.\\" <br />Now...about the album. I have had it awhile and am sorta tired of some of the songs...like Complicated and Sk8er Boi, which have been overplayed on the radio and I have heard them each at least a quarter of a million times. But apart from those, which are still good songs, I really enjoy \\"Losing Grip,\\" which has recently been released on the radio. The introduction is my favorite, because it sounds really cool. These electric guitars sorta echo each other...it's really neat! If you try the CD you'll see what I mean. Anyways, I like \\"I'm With You,\\" but Avril coulda substituted the curse word in the chorus for some other word. And it, too, was overplayed. \\"Mobile\\" is a good song, although not my absolute favorite. \\"Unwanted\\" is a good one that shows off Avril's metall-y side, and then soft, mellow \\"Tomorrow\\" follows it. After that, the cute song \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" is sort of a funny song. I like it a lot. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" is a good song, but like the others, I have listened to it too much and so I'm burned out on it. \\"My World,\\" which has the A-word for DONKEY in it, is a cute song about Avril's hometown. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is a rappy song combined with some great guitars, but it has one curse word in it. \\"Too Much To Ask\\" was one of my least favorites the first few times I listened to it but it grew on me and now I like it. Last but not least, \\"Naked\\" is probably my favorite apart from \\"Losing Grip.\\" (No, the song is NOT talking about nudity! LOL!) It is more of a mellow song, and it has the echo-ing guitars in it too. <br />I really liked this CD...but it is up to you to decide for yourself! Try the CD and review it so others can see your point of view also! I think Avril has done an excellent job for her debut album, and she has earned a lot of popularity, which will hopefully inspire her to put out more albums. <br />Thanks, and enjoy the CD!!! :0)
B000089RVX|5.0|If you like this band then there many good bands out there like NightWish and Lucana Coil. Pretty much the same style just NightWish and Lucana Coil are from Europe so it maybe a little harder to find there cds. NightWish comes from Finland and Lucana Coil comes from Italy. Both bands started before Evanscence but these guys are pretty good.

B000002G30|4.0|This is a keeper. I think this album is probably the best of Monster Magnet so far. The first three songs are enough by themselves to make it worth your money, but the rest is good too. In my opinion Look To Your Orb For The Warning is one of the best songs ever recorded. Ever!! I've never seen a true rock and roller that didn't like it. If you really want some jam, buy all their CD's, and burn your own &quot;Ultimate Monster Magnet&quot; CD with all your favorite tracks. Thats what I did, and its the best tailgate party cd that I've got(except maybe AC/DC's Back In Black).

They have a sound that is their own, somewhat distinctive and identifiable,  but that sound of theirs isn't radically different from similar bands that preceded them- think Limp Bizkit, in particular. <br />Hybrid Theory was an album that wasn't too different from the rest of all the similar albums being released at the time. The songs all sounded the same, and they all followed the same formula. However, they followed the formula well, and were able to perfect it. Hybrid Theory is probably the pinnacle of the 1999-2001 Rock/Rap scene.<br />Linkin Park continues in the same direction. They follow the same formula, and all the songs on Meteora sound very similar to both each other and the songs on Hybrid Theory. <br />The question is: Is that a bad thing?<br />Well, it depends. Linkin Park knows &quot;The Formula&quot;, and they adhere to it. Rigidly. They also do &quot;The Formula&quot; better than everybody else out there, so even if all the songs sound the same, they're all relatively solid. <br />Look- Don't expect some innovative masterpiece. Expect some very well-done rock/rap with some slightly cornball lyrics. If you're looking for a continuation (or a clone) of Hybrid Theory, or just some really good rock/rap, then you can't do any better than Meteora.
0060537639|2.0|The basic idea of Mr. Menzies started out with, that the Chinese could have performed a voyage such as the one he describes, is certainly accurate.  Technologically, they had the capacity to do so.  And this fact makes it worthwhile to explore wether or not they did indeed do so.<br />But Mr. Menzies is clearly not the person to perform such an undertaking- and this is not because he lacks credentials as a professional historian.  There are many works of &quot;amatuer&quot; history that are quite luadable and accurate, and many works of historical fiction (such as those of Stephen Pressfield) that, while fiction, are underpinned by an enormous amount of good research.<br />Mr. Menzies is the wrong man for the job because he has already begun his research firmly convinced of the conclusion of that research.  He then proceeds to take every piece of evidence and jam it inot the framework he has already constructed, regardless of how well it fits (or doesn't) and (I can only assume)discard bits of evidence that are inconvenient.  One of the problems with assessing the accuracy of this or any other historical work is that we are only allowed to see what the author presents us in an entirely one sided &quot;conversation.&quot;  The way I generally decide wether or not to &quot;trust&quot; an historical work is to verify the author's statements when I can, and if these statements are generally trustworthy, I am often willing to take the rest &quot;on faith.&quot;<br />Many of the areas of Mr. Menzies claims (that I know about) are complete nonsense.  And some are of a manner of nonsense that leads me to question his familiarity with even basic history.  For example, on page 415 he claims to have set up a team of researchers who could &quot;read medieval spanish and portuguese, including Brazilian Portuguese.&quot;  I am astonished by this, as there in fact is no such language as &quot;medieval Brazilian Portuguese.&quot;  The initial Portuguese explorers and colonists of Brazil spoke medieval portuguese, but a Brazilian varient of Portuguese did not emerge until modern times, and even to this day the differences between continental portguese and Brazilian are more a matter of some vocabulary and a great deal of pronunciation difference than anything else.  This would be akin to me claiming that I had assembled a team of researchers who could &quot;read medieval english, including American English.&quot;<br />Linguistic evidence figures heavily into the book.  Unfortunately for Mr. Menzies, I speak portuguese fluently, and so am not at all impressed with his vlaims about portugese words and their origin.<br />For example, one of the pieces of &quot;evidence&quot; that the Chinese colonized Brasil is the fact that the Brazilian word for &quot;raft&quot; (Jangada) is similar to the Tamil word for raft (zuingada, if I recall correctly).  Thus the Brazilians must have learned that word from the Chinese treasure fleets, and their tamil fellow travellers.<br />Or perhaps, Brazilians being portugese speakers,they could have brought the word with them from Portugal, where &quot;raft&quot; is also &quot;Jangada.&quot;  My belief is that, given the extensive trade contacts and Portuguese colonies in India, either the tamils learned that word from the Portuguese, or vice versa.  In India, not in Brazil.<br />Not that this constitutes an absolute refutation of Mr. Menzies thesis, but it does indicate the fact that he is willing to make forthright claims in areas where he has no knowledge.  This leads me to doubt his other forthright claims in areas where I cannot verify what he says.<br />All in all, I founf the book worthwhile for what little information it contained about the treasure fleet, and certainly it leads me to beleive that we ought to set some better historians upon this trail.  I would like to see what they would have to say.Brazil spoke medieval portuguese, but a Brazilian varient of Portuguese did not emerge until modern times, and even to this day the differences between continental portguese and Brazilian are more a matter of some vocabulary and a great deal of pronunciation difference than anything else.

B000001EGA|1.0|This album rivals Bob Dylan's \\"Self-Portrait\\" and the Rolling Stones' \\"Satanic Majesties\\" for the dubious distinction of being the worst album ever released by a major artist of legitimately great talent.  Elton has said that unlike The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, he is not someone whom drugs inspire to create great music.  .....  Like tens of millions of others who had regarded him as the shining light of popular music in the early 1970's, I eagerly awaited this album . . . and couldn't believe my ears when I played it for the first time.<br />Deliberately shallow, pop in a cutesy way, this album was for Elton what the worst Wings albums were for Paul McCartney--the nadir of an enormously talented artist whose talents were enormously undermployed for a time.  I once liked \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight,\\" but now the long, cloying falsetto at the end  makes it intolerable to me.  And every other song on this album has been consistently unlistenable to my ears since the day I first purchased this turkey.  <br />It is hard to believe the same man who gave us \\"Elton John,\\" \\"Madman Across the Water,\\" \\"Honky Chateau\\" and \\"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road\\"--and who later gave us \\"Made in England\\" and \\"The One\\"--could release an album like this. ....
0385504209|5.0|To enjoy this book you must accept the threads of the plotline as it unfolds, and a dilly of a one it is! Jesus Christ was but a human being, and he and Mary Magdalene were married and had a child, a female. The Jesus line, with supporting documents, were kept by a secret organization called the Priory of Sion, to be protected from a predatory Church, the Truth to be revealed at the proper time. That, in a nutshell, is the basis around which this exciting thriller is framed, and the story moves along at a breathless pace. The reader never gets to stop and catch his breath before another twist or turn happens. As long as you can accept the story line, you will enjoy this book. If you can't do that, there's no sense in reading it. I always accept the world which the author paints for me, so I did really enjoy reading this book, and I highly recommend it.
B000009EAD|5.0|Finally, in the confusion of all the metal these days, there is still a band that knows how to play. Instead of screaming dumb lyrics, and giving a constant gimick that is childish, Iced Earth plays music that actually challenges the listener. With a lead singer that can actually sing and, unlike certain other bands,  actual talented musicians, this album should please any true metal fan.
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you are a true fan of Linkin Park, then this is a must have.  I have been dieing for a new release from these guys forever since their remake CD just didn't cut it.  Great great album.  First four songs are perfection.

B00005NWM3|2.0|As everyone else has already stated the CD starts off good with &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; not suprisingly the two hit singles, but after that there isn't anything else that really stands out. Plus, with the radio stations playing the only two good songs constantly they get old really quick. I was really dissapointed in this CD.. and the fact that there are now dozens of bands that sound just like this one. Theres no originality anymore.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|After you watch it youll be singing the songs during the day, the sound is so great that you just cant watch the videos quietly, youll put it louder and louder and louder.

0784011176|5.0|It's extremely hard to describe this movie and do it justice. As an eighteen year old who A.)Plays the piano and B.)Watches a LOT of movies, perhaps I am partial; but when I watched this, I was incredibly moved. It's hard to say what ONE thing it is about this, which means, the movie as a whole is amazing. Not only is the scenery beautiful, which I have noticed many people above have mentioned, but Holly Hunter is very rare in this. She performs so delicately as this mute woman, so eerliy silent, and having it be her CHOICE not to speak only adds to that feeling. The characters were chosen perfectly, from Anna Paquin to Harvey Keitel as a SEX symbol in this. Which is hard to believe but he pulls it off and actually is incredibly charming in this. There are parts that will give you butterflies and parts that will make you cry. It's very different. I highly recommend it, but it's not for everyone; everyone wouldn't \\"get\\" it.
6304493681|5.0|This was my first anime and I was overwhelmed!  It seemed like a mix of Matrix and Bladerunner, but it's just so lush!  Not as gory as I expected based on other reviews.  I'm going to show it to my wife this weekend.  If you are new to this genre as well, this is a good first look.
B00005JLZ9|4.0|I will confess right now: the only reason I went to see this movie was because of Giovanni Ribisi as Kendall. I didn't really like John Travolta and I cannot stand Samuel L. Jackson, but my faith in my Gio led me into the theatre with my mother anyways. Well, simply put, it renewed my faith in watching movies just for the actors!<BR>I'm an action chick; anything with explosions, guns, and a hot guy or two will make me happy, and this one had it pretty much down. The first thing I noticed was that Giovanni Ribisi was hardly in the movie, but that was okay, because my faith in John Travolta had been restored.<BR>It has a couple too many twists, but it rocked. I'd give it 5 stars if it hadn't been so damn confusing throughout the entire thing, and if they'd gotten me to like Samuel L. Jackson (I don't think that's possible though).<BR>They also could have given Giovanni a little more screen time! ;-)
B000002UAO|1.0|The beginning of the end for the Beatles.  For a Rock and Roll band, the Beatles almost completely abandoned the genre for this outing.  Replete with Indian influences, sitars and the like, this album marked the beginning of the downward spiral the Beatles would be on until their overdue break-up at decade's end.  Lennon himself called this the &quot;pot album&quot; and he couldn't have described it better.  The Beatles were always at their best as Rock and Rollers and this album along with every album they recorded after this one were weird studio-trickery albums with songs that by-and-large couldn't be duplicated on stage. Thus, the band stopped touring, locked themselves in Abby Road Studios, and for the next four LONG years, overindulged in pot and hallucinogens and proceeded to record the effect these chemicals had on them.  How they continued to sell I'll never know.  They had abandoned their fans for dope.  If you want a sampling of what the Beatles were truly capable of, any album they released through Help would do.  They are particularly strong when handling covers like Twist &amp; Shout, Rock &amp; Roll Music, Roll Over Beethoven, Long Tall Sally, and the list goes on.  Lennon, McCartney and Harrison also had their fair share of self-penned Rockers between 1963 and 1965, but were never again to record a true Rock and Roll post 1965/Help.  For further insight compare the hard-rockin' 1963 version of &quot;One Afer 909&quot; that appears on the first Anthology with the more familiar version on the Let It Be album.  What a difference and not a good one.  The Let It Be version is, like the band, tired, bored and due for a rest.  Early Beatles ('63 - '65) are your best bet.
B00005JKZT|5.0|A powerful and sensational movie that took my breath away.I have seen the movie 4 incredible times and never had such an experience.Better than the first one and the main characters are taking their shapes in a magnificent performance.Gollum appearance added another level of drama to the movie and yet it is unbelievable that it is just a CGI.<BR>Can't wait to own it on a DVD.
B00007E8V4|3.0|It's better than Toxicity, but not as good as their self-titled album. 'Nuff said.
B00006690G|1.0|If you enjoy hearing someone talk about things that they have NO clue about then you will like this cd.  Eminem can't be brilliant.  Eminem has no clue, and never will.  Eminem makes money by selling out on his family, and introducing explicit lyrics and stupid ideas to children, which will inevitable hear his tracks regardless of stickers.  Why do we support a man that is so obviously bad for our kids, the very future of our nation?  Eminem doesn't belong in national recognition.  Let's see some originality in the direction artistic ability and not shock factor before we support this mans music.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I got this album pretty quickly after it was released but I never really listened to it enough to really appreciate it, but then I saw them in concert and they were absolutely amazing.  Brandon Boyd has a great voice and I liked how each member of the band stood out in their own way without ever having a solo.  So I decided to give this cd another chance.  It's great to hear a younger band that is truely creative and makes albums that we can listen to the whole way through without skipping tracks.  \\"Are You In\\" is my favorite song on the album, it has such a simple hook and groove, but it's incredibly moving.  For a more [of a]-kicking song, \\"Circles\\" is great too.  The main reason I give this album 4 stars instead of 5 is because the songs that were on the radio and MTV weren't as strong as the singles off their last album.  Still, I'd recommend it.
B00005JLKB|5.0|There are very few television shows out there today that capture my attention like Smallville. When I first heard that they were making a TV show about the youth of superman, I thought \\"Oh no, another Lois and Clark TV show.\\" So I didn't even catch most of the first season. I dismissed it before I even had the chance to see it. It just so happened that a friend of mine taped the first season and I started watching them at her suggestion. I was TOTALLY hooked! I haven't missed a show since! I can't believe I almost let this show pass me by. Tom Welling (Clark Kent) does a fantastic job playing the young Superhero. The show is dramatic and adventurous! The special effects are outrageous for a to show as well. I love the way they slow down the effect of Clark Kent's powers instead of speed up the effects as done in the past. Each character brings a new and exciting role to the saga of Superman. If you haven't watched this show, you need to! I promise you, you wont be sorry. I can't wait for the DVDs to come out!There are very few television shows out there today that capture my attention like Smallville.

B000089CKH|5.0|I guess you just can't tell which one-hit wonders, long after their day in the sun, will come into their own. Let Go shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is more to Nada Surf than their 1996 single &quot;Popular&quot;.  A LOT more. Let Go is evenly split between low-key songs (like the gorgeous &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;), and thrilling rockers (the bouncy, effervescent &quot;Way You Wear Your Head&quot; might be my favorite track). &quot;Hi-Speed Soul&quot;, a sort of disco throwback overlaid with modern rock, makes for an amazing centerpiece.  Only one song feels like a throwaway--the tepid &quot;La Pour Ca&quot;.  The record is wistful but invigorating, and as gorgeous as anything I've heard in a while.  It's as emotive as anything &quot;emo&quot; without being whiny or pretentious.  It's just too bad these guys are out of the spotlight, because they'd easily upstage any popular group that's been making the late-show rounds these days.
B00008I8IF|4.0|An enormous indicator of an album's ability to move the listener is how the first run through goes.  Rainy Day Music immediately gave one as comfortable an experience as an old pair of jeans.  Make no mistake the is a band truly at the top of their game continuing under the radar of mainstream success, to their benefit once again, and exploring all the sounds and instruments of their influences.  Sure there is the obvious Byrds-like jingle jangle, but it is also channeled through a Dylanesque vocal style only with lovely melody.  Gary Louris continues to emerge as a songwrtiter who actually studies his craft, as the images of his words rivet the listener the same way an actor lights up at the reading of a good script.  This should give fans just what we need in the climate of today, but don't rely on commerical radio the get your fix, get this one yourself.
B00008I8IF|4.0|The new disc is sort of a return to form for the Jayhawks.  The Wall of Sound production of &quot;Smile&quot; is gone, as is the Brit-pop of &quot;Sound of Lies.&quot;  Instead, &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; has the acoustic flavor of &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass,&quot; with even some touches of the country sound all over &quot;Blue Earth.&quot;  Gary's voice sounds a little older and a little more aching -- you get more of the plaintive high register singing that appears on the title track on &quot;Sound of Lies.&quot;  He really sounds great, nice and clear on this album -- emerging from behind the vocal effects all over &quot;Smile.&quot;  And the songs are just as tuneful and catchy as ever.  The one thing I miss on this album is the prominent piano that you had with Karen Grotberg and Jen Gunderman.  But a really strong effort overall.
B00008H2LE|5.0|First off this CD is nothing like Hybrid Theory. IT IS 10 TIMES BETTER!! All the songs transition into the next with a smooth flow that makes it easy to listen to the whole cd and not skip a song. I love how DJ Hahn scratches the beginning of &quot;Don't Stay&quot;. And the way they flipped the guitar around in &quot;Somewhere i belong&quot; shows how innovative this band is. I really don't like the medieval sound of &quot;Nobody's listening&quot;, but mike shinoda makes up for that with his emceeing. This is a must buy or must burn cd..
0060536977|3.0|While not his best novel, Crichton does a competent job of weaving a tale of suspense around some interesting emerging technologies.  The first part of the novel had me hooked, but by the time he shifts locations, Crichton started to lose me.  There are a couple of reasons for this.<br />First, there is the mystery around what is happening to his wife.  I found this pretty transparent, and so found myself having to wait far too long for it to be revealed.  Second - and this is my own fault - I found the capabilities of the technology in the story pretty tough to swallow.  I work in software, and have used some of the techniques discussed, so it was hard for me to suspend my disbelief sufficiently.<br />Still, I thought the idea behind the story was interesting, and the beginning and end of the novel were pretty engaging.  If you don't mind a little technology mixed in with your fiction, you might like this.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I wouldn't try to dissuade you from reading it, either.
B000089RVX|5.0|I discovered \\"Fallen\\" very much by accident while channel surfing when I saw their \\"Bring Me to Life\\" video on MTV.  Having been burned too many times by CD's that have only one good cut, I checked out the Evanescence Website for audio clips.  I listened to all eleven tracks and found them all excellent to outstanding, each worthy of release as a single.  <br />I bought a copy of \\"Fallen\\" the next day, and over the past week have listened to it five times.  This is notable for me for the a couple reasons.  First, I spend about 99% of my time listening to classical music.  Second, I never listen to *any* CD's in quick succession more than twice, wishing to move on to new horizons instead.  I'm in the 45-54 year old demographic group, and haven't bought a rock album in over ten years.  I have never found a rock CD to have so much interesting, beautiful, powerful, dark, haunting, and deeply moving music as this one.<br />This couldn't have come at a better time.  While I have never been a huge fan of rock music, I have had groups that I liked years ago, most notably Yes (Fragile and Close to the Edge) and Gentle Giant.   When my son was a teenager I was exposed to much of his music, the best IMO was Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.  But so much of what I think was fresh about progressive rock ten years ago has become tired and repetitive for me.  I have frankly become bored and burned-out with rock and popular music in general.  \\"Fallen\\" has renewed my faith and hope for rock music.  It is a huge breath of fresh air.<br />A very small handful of female vocalists, mostly classical, with the right music will cause me to melt.  Amy Lee, the lead singer of Evanescence, is now added to that elite group of female vocalists.  How a 21-year vocalist has achieved such a level of variety, intensity, purity, depth of expression, and sheer beauty in her singing is beyond me, but she has done it.  I can think of no other female popular singer who has so completely impressedand moved me by the sound of her voice.<br />The group has as its foundation what we have come to expect from progressive rock groups, which is typically three white guys with guitars and a drummer, but Evanescence is so much more than this.  Piano, synthesizers, vocal chorus, cello solos, digital effects, whispered lyrics, strings, and a stellar female lead vocalist coexist seamlessly, and create a wonderfully complex fabric that makes one at times think more of a symphonic orchestra than a rock band.<br />The lyrics are complex, ambiguous, very dark, but always tasteful and interesting.  The eleven tracks seem to tell portions of a story, but even after five times through this CD the true meaning of these lyrics remains a mystery to me as it should be.<br />I have read a fair number of reviews of the release.  I see the critics attempting to compare the music of Evanescence and the singing of Amy Lee to others.  I have listened to them all.  I don't see the comparison either stylistically or in terms of quality.  Listening to the interviews on their Website, this group has written music that appeals to them.  They have a wide range of influences, including classical music.  But make no mistake, this is not cross-over music.  Its heart is very much in alternative rock, but has managed to uniquely extend this musical genre.  \\"Fallen\\" has significantly elevated rock music.  Please don't miss it!
0679736646|5.0|After reading \\"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said\\" and being blown away by it, I decided to give Philip K. Dick another try.  Could he have written another novel as impressive, I wondered?<br />In short, yes.  \\"Ubik\\" is thoroughly engaging, and even though it shares an underlying theme with \\"Flow My Tears\\" (i.e. shifting reality), the author manages to explore that theme in a totally different way.  Granted, I did not find the characters to be as deep or compelling, and there was a brief slow spot in the middle of the story, but for the most part I was glued to this book as firmly as I was to \\"Tears\\".  In addition, the tone of this story was somewhat lighter, with a lead character who has trouble managing his finances in a world where everything is coin operated, and this may appeal to some more than the dark and gritty style of \\"Tears\\".<br />I would definitely recommend this - it's a great read!
B00008LOS1|4.0|...to say that Relay and Join Together were not from the Who's Next sessions.  Yes, they were Lifehouse songs, but were not recorded until the abandoned 1972 sessions when the group first attempted a follow-up album to Who's Next.<br />BUT Let's See Action and John's When I Was A Boy DO date from the Who's Next sessions, and would have been welcom additions.  When I Was A Boy has yet to be released on any of the remastered Who discs.<br />I agree this is another missed opportunity for a definitive Who's Next, but I can't say more than that as I haven't actually heard it yet (it gets released in England on Monday....).

WHILE THE STRIKE TEAM ISN'T 100% HONEST, THEY'RE NOT ALL CORRUPT EITHER. MOST OF WHAT UNSAVORY THINGS THEY DO, IS DONE IN THE NAME OF KEPPING STREETS SAFE & LOCKING UP SCUM! OF COURSE, THEY SAVE UP FOR A RAINY DAY, BUT SOMEHOW THE VILLIANS BECOME THE HEROES! SO GET READY TO ROOT FOR THE BAD GUY, & TAKE THIS DOOR INTO THE L.A. GANG SCENE, & THE COPS THAT PUT THE FEAR OF MACKIE IN THEM!
B000002J20|1.0|Look up pretentious in the dictonary and you'll find this band.<BR>If you take these guys seriously there's no hope for you. <BR>Say &quot;no&quot; to Yes.
6302648750|5.0|Here we see the Meryl Streep is truly one of the greatest as she takes on this vain and narcissistic role and does it great and with style! She truly can be anything! As well as for Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn... the incredible trio-of-doom really makes a hell of a performance for a movie that goes out from the traditional roles each actor is used to playing! Guranteed dark comedy!
B00005JLXC|3.0|The best thing about the movie was the casting of its villains. Michael Clarke Duncan was perfect for the role of Kingpin (even though Kingpin was originally white) and Colin Farrell's performance definitely made Bullseye unforgettable.
B0000039QA|5.0|And yes even better than All Eyez On Me. However I am not saying Biggie is a superior rapper. (I believe Tupac is better)<br />But i think the production on this record is a thing of beauty.<br />You've got to respect Puffy for his production even if he uses old song clips, to have an ear for hits like Hypnotized is pure talent. So as an album Life After Death is the Greatest Album Ever.<br />Peace
B00005JLXC|3.0|The best thing about the movie was the casting of the villains. Michael Clark Duncan was perfect as Kingpin (even though Kinpin was originally white) and Colin Farrell certainly made Bullseye the movie's most unforgettable character.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I'm into stuff harder than this, but this CD had me gobsmacked. It's just amazing. Since I know you want some description, here we go:<BR>Not Gonna Get Us: Really cool. I love the subject of running away from the world. 9.5/10<BR>All The Things She Said: Everyone's heard of this one, and everyone loves it, so I guess nothing I say is useful. 10/10<BR>Show Me Love: Really catchy, love the lyrics, gorgeous melodies, it's a shame it's not played more. 10/10<BR>30 Minutes: Slower than the others, but still great. Lena and Julia's voices are amazingly beautiful, never wailing when a whisper would do. 10/10<BR>How Soon Is Now?: How long does it take for pain to kill you? Very refreshing, almost reminds me of Tasmin Archer. 9/10<BR>Clowns (Can You See Me Now?): Amazing! Hauntingly beautiful! Definitely my favourite. I love the lyrics. 20/10<BR>Malchik Gay: Forget what I said about the other songs being catchy, this surpasses them all. The lyrics stick in your head like chewing gum on your shoe. I love the way they talk about unrequited love. \\"I long for you to hold me like your boyfriend does...\\" 10/10 <BR>Stars: A gorgeous blend of rap, flowing melody, Russian and English. I wasn't wild about it at first, but you have to listen to it. Now I think it's wonderful. 10/10<BR>Ya Shosla S Uma: The Russian version of All The Things She Said. I like this one better. They sound so much more expressive. It makes me wish I spoke Russian. 11/10<BR>Nas Ne Dagoniat: The Russian version of Not Gonna Get Us. Julia's voice is simply angelic in this. I learnt the lyrics to the chorus phonetically (It's not that hard, and I couldn't really help it anyway). 10.5/10<BR>Show Me Love (extended version): Same comments as for the non-extended version.<BR>30 Minutes (remix): Very jazzy. The remix privileges music over vocals, and the result isn't bad. I'll warn you: it's about 7 minutes long, but don't let that discourage you! 8.5/10<br />General Mark: 12/10<BR>Hope this helps!
079213690X|5.0|This epic movie is a classic on so many levels. It has action, drama, two great love stories, and done so realistically and gritty that really captures the essence of those times. Mel Gibson is a fine filmmaker ... reminding me of Kevin Costners great epic 'Dances with Wolves'. This movie always tugs at my heartstrings, and fills me with sadness and pride to witness such courage and 'bravery'. Must see !
B00005JLSC|1.0|The music was pretty good.  My favorite, by far, was \\"Cellophane Man\\".  The story left me very dissatisfied.  I strongly wanted <BR>justice to prevail in the end, and it didn't.  If you like a dark<BR>ending where bad prevails over good, then this is your movie.
B00004VWA7|5.0|so i am going to keep this short and sweet. if you love Jaco... this album is the &quot;stuff&quot;. if you love jazz fusion...this album is the &quot;stuff&quot;. if you love great music...this is the &quot;stuff&quot;. <BR>and if you don't like this...you don't know your &quot;stuff&quot;!
B000005IU2|5.0|I could repeat the words of dozens of reviewers and talk about how raw and visceral the performance here sounds.  What amazes me about this record, by contrast, is how -good- it sounds.<br />To talk down the musicianship of the Stooges as a point of punk orthodoxy seems beside the point when you listen to this record.  The Stooges actually sound good here!  The twin lead guitars that dominate the first half of the album do not sound sludgy at all, despite the heavy reliance on fuzztone and good old fashioned psychedelic wah-wah.  They bubble and sizzle like a brain on drugs in a skillet; the wah-wah flares and trebles the sound at just the right moment.  The rhythm section too is solid, and without it, this record would go nowhere fast.<br />Iggy, likewise, knows exactly what he's doing.  Though he seems at one point to be yelping like a mad dog, and at the next groaning like a psychedelic Frankenstein, his delivery is always well timed and right with the band.<br />Given what everyone -says- about the Stooges, I have to wonder whether or not Mr. Gallucci deserves much of the credit here.  This is one of the better engineered records of its time, with a sound that cuts like lasers.  It is a remarkable performance regardless of who should get the credit.

B00008977N|3.0|I was quite disappointed from the video quality. Actually, it the worst I have seen on a DVD.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a high quality major label debut from a young Arkansas duo, Amy Lee and Ben Moody.  Piano, string, and choral arrangements mesh with aggressive, distorted guitar and Amy's outstanding vocals to form lush, powerful melodies.  This is dark rock with definite goth elements, but the overall message is surprisingly positive for the genre.  It's pain tinged with hope.    Best of all for someone just picking up the album, it's all very catchy.  This band is NOT a one hit wonder with the excellent &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; from the movie &quot;Daredevil&quot;.  As others have said here, if you like this song, then you'll like the album.  It's hardly left my CD player since I got it last week and that's very rare for me.  It's not a perfect disc.  Some of the tracks sound a little too similar, but not enough to bother me so far, and I can't decide if the guest vocals on &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; were a good addition or not.  I have a recording of the track without the male vocals and it works well that way too.  Still, it's a great disc.  If we could rate them one to ten here, I'd give it a solid 9.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|I highly recommend any metal fans to pick up this CD right away...it's better than Awake.  A couple of the songs can be skipped, but otherwise all of them are great.  I gave this a 4 instead of 5 stars because it's not exactly a CD that one can listen to all the way through....you'll be hitting the SKIP button a couple of times here.  <br /> ...
B00005QY5Y|5.0|So what if I want to be sad when I listen to this.  So what that people have said that they can hear his influences.  So what that this is not Whiskeytown.  (yeah he would be criticized if he put something out that sounded just like Whiskeytown &quot;not diverse enough&quot;)  Basically this album kicks if you are into the alt. country or even classic hit genres.  The sounds are edgy, sad, lyrical, hypnotic (yeah Ryan's been smokin') and wonderful.  Different sounds will appeal to different moods.  Best of all Mr. Adams displays his own feelings and emotions in this album, something that I really look for in music.  The album could have done better with less production, but that can be found in some of his other work.  This is a good buy if you are intrigued about the hype.
B00005J9M1|5.0|I ran around my house the other day like a madman!  I found that I was missing one of my favorite CDs.  I too had that original orange cased Cd.  Oh where is it?  Anyway, I ran to the local music shop to see if they had that CD, the cool one with the orange case.  All they had was this re-issue.  Well, re-issues tend to get tiring and truth be told, I hardly ever buy them.  But here I found myself dishing out about 30 US dollars for this CD.  (CDs are much more expensive at retail stores in Mexico!)  I ran back home and played the second CD, especially since the I knew the album by heart.  I liked it very much, but not as much as I love the album itself.  <BR>It all starts with Can You Forgive Her?  a great-don't-say-anything-about-my-sexuality song to Go West a we-don't-care-what-you-say-about-our-sexuality-we-just-want-to-be-free song.<BR>So, If you are gay (like me) please go out and buy this CD.  If you're not, go out and buy it anyway.  Better yet, order it here.
0790731452|3.0|This a stupid, but cute and entertaining movie with lots of known actors. I enjoyed the movie although I can not really recommend it as good. It is basically a satire of an early b\w movie (war of the worlds I thinnk).
B000002LCK|5.0|The usual new wave was playing that morning in 1983, Kids in America, etc...  Then the first thumps came on from what was Blue Monday.  I've been hooked ever since.  For a 13 year old boy, this was heavy stuff.  Most of my friends were listening to Def Leppard or Motley Crue but I found heaven when I discovered New Order.  They were never an album band for me, that is until Technique, they were more of a 12 inch band.  Those fabulous vinyl pieces of art.  This is the way New Order was meant to be heard.  So turn it up, and put on your dancing shoes.
B00008DDSC|2.0|This is a strange movie about the relationship of a woman (The secretary) and her boss. They are not what you would consider normal, so their relationship is odd. The movie was slow in some parts and out of sequency in others. I believe most people will not enjoy this film.
0783226063|4.0|It's an old showbiz maxim that one should always leave one's audience wanting more. By that standard, David Lynch's \\"Dune\\" should have been a spectacular success. By trying to tell this story in the time-span of a shortish feature film, Lynch has given us a tantalizing overview -- filled with fleeting situations and characterizations that were gone before I could grasp them.I've seen this film many times and keep wanting to see \\"the rest\\" of the story -- or at least every inch of film that got left on the cutting room floor.<br />Because, despite its flaws in coherence, this is gallant and often magnificent effort -- to my mind far more true to Herbert than the rather-too-glitzy miniseries. Just before the film's release in 1984, I read a detailed article on it in the now-defunct \\"SF\\" magazine. In the article, Lynch described his vision of Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" universe -- as an ancient and degenerate culture where innovation has stagnated and civilization is ruled by tradition, protocol and superstition. To realize this vision, he created an environment where everything -- buildings, clothes, technology -- is too heavy, too ornate, ponderous and overdone. Since the Guild Navigators can transport anything by \\"folding space\\", the ships don't have to be sleek and aerodynamic -- instead they're slow and unwieldy. The women's court clothes make Elizabethan garb look lightweight. There's a wonderful scene when Rev. Mother Gaius is leaving the reception room and I'll swear that her train and veil extend 20 feet behind her. The Navigator's travel tank looks like a cross between an Art Deco railroad car and a restaurant's lobster tank. All the machinery is oversized and clunky -- as it would be in a civilization that had fought a jihad to rid the universe of so-called \\"thinking machines.\\"<br />Far from the centers of power, the world of Arrakis is life stripped down to its barest essentials. The fremen's appearance is what one would expect from people living on a harsh, waterless world where they've been hiding in subterranean compounds for millennia -- they're ragged and dirty. Only the stillsuits are whole, even these are dirty. The only bits of color and beauty they posses are their blue-within-blue eyes. <br />The only \\"world\\" where I thought Lynch's vision was offbase was House Harkonnen. The baron is a caricature of evil rather than the real thing -- disgusting to look at, but without the intelligence and guile to make him a truly dangerous adversary.<br />So many of the performances of this international cast are marvellous -- if only you got to see more of each one. Francesca Annis, Linda Hunt, Richard Jordan, Jurgen Prochnow, Sian Phillips, Dean Stockwell, Freddie Jones (Thufir Hawat)among others are all wonderful. <br />But to me the real standout is Kyle McLachlan. His portrayal of Paul Atreides combines a young man's impetuosity with the gravitas expected of the Atreides heir and that Something Else that makes his elevation to near godhood by the fremen eminently believable. And it is mainly the characterization of Paul in the miniseries that gives me the biggest problem -- maybe it's my age, but I just don't think spiky hair and an attitude problem a messiah make -- no matter how dazzling the sfx.<br />No, for me, this earlier film, with all its flaws, is as close to the \\"real\\" Dune as I think the film makers art can get. Unless of course, David Lynch were to do a re-edit to create a mini-series. I'm sure the footage exists -- I was lucky enough to see a director's cut on late night TV once (4+ hours) that nearly satisfied my craving for \\"more\\".<br />My recommendation? Read the book, then see this film. Then, if you like, watch the miniseries and then maybe read the book again. I think you'll agree that it is David Lynch, not the creators of the miniseries, who truly see \\"Dune\\" with Frank Herbert's eyes.
B00005RIKD|3.0|The music on this disc is a special arrangement put together by Sting reviewing his many years in the music business, performed in front of a small handpicked audience.  I for one was a little disappointed by the change, but this record is great for anyone who wants to hear Sting apply his eclectic style in a different light.  Sting takes his classics and re-vamps them: \\"All This Time\\" and \\"Brand New Day\\" take on a hint of the blues, \\"If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)\\" gets a lick of Clapton...and old Police hits get a turn as well.  \\"Every Breath You Take\\" loses its melancholy and becomes a rousing closing number, even dimming down the famous guitar riff.  Even Sting's mellow ballad \\"Fields of Gold\\" is unfortunately weakened by a bad vocal turn on the artist's part. In a nutshell, if you're looking for the Sting you know and love, you won't find it here. However, if you like experimental sounds and want to hears Sting's songs in a different light and mood, here is where you should turn.
B000069HKH|5.0|I am officially a HUGE Bruce Springsteen fan! This album is incredible. My favourite songs are &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Waitin' on a Sunny Day&quot;. But the whole thing is just awesome, the kind of CD you could put in and sit back and listen to. I would reccommend it to anyone who is a fan, or even for someone who isn't. Because by the end of this album you will be. A lot of people refer it to 9/11, but I think its more than that. Just a remarkable piece of work. Thumbs up Bruce!!
0345440757|5.0|I highly recommend this book for all new parents (especially if you have twins!)  If you don't buy any other parenting book, get this one!!  I have twins, and this book was such a big help in deciphering what they needed!  A friend of mine also had twins and said she wished she had read this book before her first child.  So, even if you already have a child, this book is for you!  Unfortunately, I didn't read the book until they were 1 month old (when I was on my own all day long with no help!), but it helped so much!  They were on a schedule early on and slept through the night at 6 weeks!  This is so important when you have twins!<br />I recommend reading the book before your child is born so you can start right away communicating with your baby.  The book puts all babies in different categories according to temperament, which really helps figure them out.  My girls are now almost two, and they are the happiest kids!  Everyone comments on how independent they are and how happy they are all the time.  I'm not going to give this book all the credit (I think their parents have a lot to do with that), but it did help to get them off to the right start.<br />One note:  I DO NOT agree with her philosophy about twins because she thinks they should be on different schedules so as to have time with each.  If you do this, you never get ANY time to yourself.  I nursed my twins, and I did so simultaneously (like most twin moms), so they were on the same schedule and still are!!  My girls are still very independent and have their own personalities.<br />This is a great book if you want to communicate with your baby, treat your baby as a unique human being, and keep your sanity!!  The best thing for me was all the advice on schedules, how to calm your baby, how to give a bath (sounds silly, but her way works), and getting baby to sleep (eventually without a pacifier -- we got rid of ours at 6 months).<br />As with all books, take what you want and leave what you don't.  Not everything is perfect for every parent or child.everything is perfect for every parent or child.
630204135X|1.0|Bergman is a terrible director.  All of his movies have horrible dialog and next to no story.  He rarely has a resolution to what little story he does provide.  Most of his films just force symbolism down your throat like so much tripe.  I don't understand how he became world famous.  Persona is especially the case, the only good thing about this film is the cinimatography, which alone does not make a good movie.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is a great CD! The guys have combined the heaviness of awake with the catchy hooks of the first disc. This has been a bad year for hyped cds ( like the new everclear for one) but this band always delievers the goods. Just buy it and you won't be letdown. The best CD out right now and will get you ready for Black Label society and Anthrax! Long Live Heavy Loud Metal! Highlights are Make me believe, Changes, ... and   Re-align.
B00008URYM|5.0|American Life is possibly her best release ever. You have to listen this over and over again and theres always something new!<BR>Production is superb, chorus is killer and rap-part is funky!<br />You are best thin I've seen, you are not just a dream!...
0441172717|5.0|Dune is the greatest book I have ever read. It's a great mixture of science fiction, philosophy, and ecolgical events. Some people find that Dunes only shortcomming was the dialog,however I found if quite interesting. It differed from the norm and reminded you that it is a completely alien society.
6302415993|1.0|Most Unfortunately I was there at the Altamont 'speedway', actually dirt field with a wee bit of grass.<BR>The Mick Taylor lineup tried their best, but their efforts fell flat, due to extensive On-stage appearances by the 'hell's Angels and many other uninvited on stage 'whatevers.'  This last Altamont 'free-concert' followed a really great L.A. Forum performance, several hours delayed, but ended near 0700 the next morning.  The Video 'sucks', it is 98% junk, but there is a studio (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, that is quite nice.
0393320928|5.0|Not as entertaining as its predecessor, &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot;, but still quite entertaining in its own way, more than half of this book is devoted to describing the experiences of Feynman as he took part in the committee investigating the Shuttle Challenger disaster. As anyone who's read the first book can imagine, setting Feynman loose on a governmental committee is not exactly a recipe for smooth interaction; what it IS a recipe for is getting far more straight answers uncovered than the bureaucrats want.<br />Not to say that this book isn't funny, but if you're looking for a chuckle, read the earlier book. If, on the other hand, you're in the mood for being reminded, in a fairly lighthearted way, just why it is that bureaucracies are not a good thing, this is the book for you. In addition to the section on the Challenger investigation, there are a few biographical anecdotes, as well as a closing lecture on &quot;The Value of Science&quot;, all of which are good reading.
0553382179|5.0|I can't get enough of this book. I have read it over and over.<BR>It is the number ONE helper to get you organized.<BR>From someone who has REALLY been there.

B00008LDPU|4.0|I, with a couple friends, bought tickets to see Dreamcatcher with the sole purpose of seeing the Animatrix short The Final Flight of the Osiris.  I could not believe how realistic the characters were and the story line was terrific.  After first seeing it I did not really like the story, but that was before I knew that it was only part of a greater picture.  Now knowing this vital bit of information I realize that for nine minutes of film there is a lot of action going on. The movements of the individual characters is fluid and graceful with little or no evidence of the process in the final product.  The skin along the joints stretches and retracts as they move.  I could not believe how real they appear in the opening scene, the only thing unreal about it was how high they could jump.  Flying in slow motion gives the viewer the ability to see the near individual strands of hair move as if blown by the wind.  I know that if given the chance to see the entire set of shorts that I will thirst for more.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Okay this movie was very well done great effects and all but the story was cut to much for it to be as enjoyable as the books. I know that no movie will ever amount to the value of the book or detail, but I still believe they cut some of the important parts like how they cut out Filch's squib thing that may be important in future books for all we know. <BR>  The second reason why I give it a four is because the special features are not so great. The features are very similar to the first movie. They give you very few behind the scenes info. like most movies. All you really get is a quick description to how it was like to work on the movie and how the actors have grown. Not enough in my opinon. But hey you buy it and judge for yourself.
B00006F83Y|4.0|At first listen only a few songs will spark your interest. But that's usually the way it is with most bands that i listen to as of late...Radiohead, Tool, Ministry even MuDvAyNe...all of these bands have sparked individuality and uniqueness by making songs which do the unexpected. you usually go into a song expecting something but the Queens(and all the above mentioned bands) end up doing something else. After a few listens this album will only get better and better as the song structures unravel before your very ears. unlike modern radio rock they're no obvious catchy chorases and hooks and most of all there is no [sign] of a hit single. the surprise success of \\"No One Knows\\" is really beyond me as it grows on you just like any other song featured on the album. The Cd is actually \\"Songs For The Patient\\" as it only gets better with time. My personal favorites include \\"First It Giveth\\", \\"Song For The Dead\\", \\"Go With The Flow\\", and \\"God Is In The Radio\\". Check out Rated R if you can't get enough of Deaf and you'll be hooked.  Keep listening...
B000066NW0|1.0|She said it best herself in her lame little song... \\"It's all been done before\\". You sure got THAT right. Someone needs to tell this little pep-rally prep she's not hardcore. She needs to get it thru her Easy-Bake-Oven-head that she's really just Britney with clothes on.<br />If Avril is punk, then Shania Twain is deathmetal.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|...Not that the first two albums weren't great, but Godsmack's third album release contains more of exactly what fans love about their music.  The already released singles of \\"I Stand Alone\\" and \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" give fans a taste of the power of Faceless.  My favorite song is \\"Serenity\\", which is similar sounding to \\"Voodoo\\" from their first album with the congas and guitars.  Then there are songs like \\"I F****** Hate You\\" and \\"Changes\\" which show you the other extreme of the band, particulary Sully's vocal talents.  If you are already a Godsmack fan or just being introduced to them, I definately recommend getting this album!
B000002H33|5.0|This album is so good it isn't even funny. The speed at which they play is incredible and the riffs are awesome. It is everything that you could ask for in a metal album. It is extremely heavy and played at the speed of light. I enjoy Metallica's current work but this material is far better, and gets at exactly what metal is all about. It's a real shame that there isn't a sound out today that matches this album's intensity and sense of genious. This album represents a forgotten time, in which everything came together for Metallica. It is quite possibly the greatest metal album ever produced. Rock on.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I had my copy of the DVD 5th April in Hong Kong (dunno why it was a week earlier) and it was SO much better than the first one. As usual, there are two discs, one for movie, and the other for Special Features. The Movie disc had the trailer and also a quick review on the first movie.<BR>the Special Features disc was a HUGE improvement. Firstly, the Additional (deleted) scenes were not HIDDEN somewhere: you can select it on the main menu. There's a &quot;Play All&quot; function, which makes viewing a lot more easier. The tours, sketches and interviews are great, but the games are okay, especially the &quot;Forbidden Forest Challenge&quot; which was confusing. They both have goodies when you finished it (at least the Chamber one, I couldn't finish the Forest one).
B000002UD0|3.0|In 1974, Lennon was separated from Yoko Ono and had just suffered through some drunken sessions with Phil Spector in Los Angeles. Back in New York, Lennon sobered up enough to do a serious album of some quality, which is &quot;Walls and Bridges.&quot; Really I'd like to give this one three and a half stars. The hit song &quot;Whatever Gets You Through the Night&quot; is a fun pop record, nothing profound, but very listenable. The lush &quot;#9 Dream,&quot; (in which Lennon poignantly recants his 1970 statement &quot;I don't believe in Beatles&quot;)is also a high point. &quot;Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out&quot; is a great song of defeat. &quot;Scared,&quot; in the same vein, is overlong and lacks melody. &quot;Old Dirt Road&quot; sounds like a mushy rewrite of &quot;Imagine,&quot; just as &quot;Steel and Glass&quot; sounds like a tame remake of &quot;How Do You Sleep,&quot; this time directed against business manager Allen Klein. &quot;What You Got&quot; and &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; are both enjoyable hardy rockers. Throughout, the production is professional but perhaps a bit much, considering the underlying emotional honesty of many of the songs. Overall, this is a slightly dated mixed bag that I like to listen to once in a while but not terribly often.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Well first off... you can't very well criticize Meteora for being under 40 minutes when Hybrid Theory was also. Furthermore, if you expect a clone of Hybrid Theory, stay away; every band evolves from album to album and to expect the same style on every track as their previous work is ludicrous. But they do carry over the same rap/rock marriage interspersed with guitar riffs and incredible vocals. Chester has an incredible range--he can be as angsty as Kurt Cobain but can also harmonize better than any dime-a-dozen bubblegum pop star out there. Also, their songs take a long time to compose, because it's just that, composing. They work with their DJ, Hahn, to blend the conventional bass/guitar/drums with a more futuristic beat. And as far as lyrics go, Linkin Park is much more profound than 90% of other bands out there. They're about emotion.<br />   As far as the music goes, simply put, it rocks. LP combined all the great aspects of Hybrid Theory and added a new edge. I could name off songs an tell you how much each of them would sell as singles, or I can tell you to go buy Meteora and have the enthralling experience yourself. What the fun in ruining a surprise, and a great one at that?
B000068TPN|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang : The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam\\" was written by Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway. A bestseller when first published it is the story of the first significant engagement between American troops and the Viet Cong, which took place between October 23 and November 26, 1965. Moore was the commander of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, and Galloway was the only reporter present throughout the 34 days of the battle. The Battle of Ia Drang in the central highlands of Vietnam is considered the first time and place where helicopter-based, air-mobile operations were used in combat. However the technological advancements of war become secondary to the story of over 400 U.S. soldiers surrounded by 2000 of the enemy. Heroism under relentless fire becomes the true story of the book and the main virtue of this 2002 film from director Randall Wallace (\\"The Man in the Iron Mask\\").<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" assumes that the audience does not know about the book on which the film is based; it toys with the audience several times with setting up Moore (Mel Gibson) to be killed. Moore knows history and cannot help but wondering if he is also leading the 7th calvary into a massacre just like Custer in 1876; however, Sgt. Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) pointedly reminds Moore of that fact the colonel ain't Custer. The backbone of the story is Moore's promise to his men that he would be the first one on and the last one off the battlefield and not even orders from his superiors, who do not want to have an American lieutenant colonel killed during a massacre, are going to get him to break his word. But ultimately the entire purpose of this film is to provide a realistic portrait of ground combat during Vietnam and drive home the fact that these soldiers were not fighting and dying for their country but for each other. This particular firefight lasts three days and nights, 56 straight hours of nonstop battle, and time and time again you become convinced that none of these soldiers are going to get out of there alive.<br />The battle is juxtaposed with scenes of Moore's wife, Julie (Madeline Stowe), who is forced to deliver the telegrams announcing the death of their husbands to their widows because the Army was using taxi cabs drivers. Like a similar scene in \\"A League of Their Own,\\" such scenes violate our scene of propriety, ingrained in countless other war movies from \\"The Fighting Sullivans\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" that the military has a moral imperative in sending officers out to deliver such shattering news in person. However, we end up getting the idea that these telegrams were being sent while the bodies of these men were still lying in body bags on the battlefield.<br />Hal Moore, who retired as a Lt. General, gave \\"We Were Soldiers\\" his stamp of approval as the first Hollywood film to get what fighting was like in Vietnam, which is good enough for me. Watching this film while American troops are again fighting and dying in a war on the other side of the globe makes it even more potent. The performances are uniformly good, with Barry Pepper as the reporter Galloway, who distinguishes himself both with his camera and an automatic rifle during the battle, Greg Kinnear as head chopper pilot Major Bruce Crandall, and Keri Russell as Barbara Geoghegan, the wife of a young 2nd Lt. who sees her husband go off to war right after she had given birth to their first child. My only major complaint about this film is that the score by Nick Glennie-Smith often overwhelms the scenes of battle with music that provides a discordant apotheosis. I can totally appreciate the idea of not providing heroic music, but what we have here goes too far in sanctifying the action. The blood and the guts being displayed by heroic actions and brutal deaths on screen do that without needing the music; just watch the \\"Broken Arrow\\" chapter for proof.<br />Before the final credits the film shows the names of the soldierswho died at L-Z X-Ray ; even more poignant is the fact that there names are inscribed on Panel 3 East of the Vietnam War Memorial, because there were so many panels that follow (70 in all inscribed with 58,000 names). Ultimately, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" avoids taking a political stance on the war beyond what is brought to the experience by the audience (the most political scene with Moore debriefed by McNamra & Westmoreland is one of those deleted). Moore's battlefield counterpart, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An (Don Duong) is presented as a dedicated, competent leader (the scenes in his underground command post also provide us our clearest understanding of what is actually happening on the battlefield). When Moore looks at the diary of a Vietcong soldier who almost killed him, he finds a picture of a woman, who to my eye anyway looks like Moore's own wife. The symmetry makes it perfectly clear that the troops on the other side were soldiers too.iers who died at L-Z X-Ray ; even more poignant is the fact that there names are inscribed on Panel 3 East of the Vietnam War Memorial, because there were so many panels that follow (70 in all inscribed with 58,000 names).

B00005JLF5|3.0|DS9 was the Rodney Dangerfield of television; it couldn't get much respect from long time NextGen fans nor of fans of the original series. I've heard DS9 described as boring because it's set on a space station (as if that has any relevance)and lacking the sense of adventure of NextGen. The fact is that DS9 eventually grew into the one of the best written science fiction series on television.<br />The first season was wildly uneven with politically charged, intelligent science fiction alternating with lame brain routine adventures that could have been written for any show. Duet stands as the most stunning individual episode although the pilot is equally as good (although a bit scattered as befits an episode setting up the characters). What's most interesting is the look at religion, politics and science on the show. Given Roddenberry's beliefs, I was surprised that DS9 eventually made it to the air as it tackles each subject but doesn't judge the value systems or beliefs of others.<br />No doubt, it made it to the air because 1) Roddenberry wasn't around to object; 2)Berman was in command along with co-creator Michael Pillar; 3) It kept the franchise viable as NextGen began winding down.<br />Avery Brooks gives a frequently firey performance as Sisko and Nana Visitor is every bit his equal. All the actors do a great job.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|First, I have to confess that I am such a fan of Johnny Cash, that I would probably buy a recording of him singing the phonebook.  With that said, however, his cover of &quot;Hurt&quot; is one of the most powerful songs I have ever heard.  If this is his way of saying farewell as he nears the end - a farewell that can almost bring tears to your eyes as you watch the video for the song - this song may well be his most memorable decades down the line.<br />The remainder of the album has its peaks and valleys, but I would rate it a must-have on the basis of &quot;Hurt&quot; alone.
6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton's hilarious, artistic dark comedy &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; is entirely filmed in claymation and released in 1991. It is now on DVD and as good as it was when it was first released. Tim Burton's magic is present in every scene. The dark comedy is set to the haunting, beautiful music of Danny Elfman, who has collaborated with Tim Burton before (Edward Scissorhands). Tim Burton's comedic take on Christmas, with a macabre twist, and memorable characters, makes this a very timeless classic.<br />The story is about Jack Skeleton, a skeletal resident of Halloween Town who accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town. Here, he abducts Santa Claus and decides that this year, Christmas will be very different. Taking up Santa's role, he readies reindeer (his dog) and brings uncommon gifts to children.  For example, he sends them decapitated heads and ghoulish creations that are more suited to Halloween. The laughs and situations are all very apt, well written and the claymation very incredible.<br />This is a must have for fans of Tim Burton, for fans of great animated or claymated comedy. The DVD has new features, such as new scenes, and other enhancements that make this experience all the more exciting and artistic.
B0000640VO|4.0|This is a great, light-hearted romantic comedy that I really enjoyed. The story is about a quirky young French woman, Amelie, who fixes other people's lives and ends up fixing her own. The story-telling was a bit out of the ordinary and done so quite humorously. After watching Amelie, I doubt I'll view new character introductions quite the same. <br />Keep in mind that this is a French movie with English subtitles so you'll have to pay attention to the movie if you want to follow what's going on. <br />I would definitely watch this one again. There were subtleties that I probably missed while reading the subtitles. Besides, it's a good, funny story that's well done. <br />Oh, and be sure to check out the special features. Audrey Tautou's audition is priceless. <br />Recommend: Yes<BR>Watch again: Yes

B000089RVX|4.0|I didn't buy the CD - I jacked it from my sister who's a little po'd at me since I won't give it back!<br />All I have to say is WOW - this woman's vocals are SOOOOOO beautiful! I'm so jealous. This is a good CD for all your moods - I happened to listen to it after a very painful breakup and it soothed me on the four hour car ride home.<br />I'd get it - you won't be disappointed.
B000089RVX|5.0|With bands like Dave Matthews, Matchbox 20, Nickleback and Disturbed achieving prominance on the airwaves, here comes this unknown band from a town that's probably known for its contributions to country music.  With haunting and melodic vocals, experimental harmonies, brilliant instrumentation and hard guitar riffs, this is an album that will appeal to a variety of listeners.  The album is dark, repleat with angst and despair.  As a result, some of the songs would make a perfect backdrop to an Anne Rice novel.  Evanescence is one of best musical talent to come along in a while.  My only beef with &quot;Fallen&quot; is that all the songs are played in the same minor key, which leads one to believe that all 11 songs are variations on the same theme.  I'd like to hear some different styles toyed with on their next album.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is ABSOLUTELY - perfect! However, I'll review it in pieces as it is quite... separated. ;)<br />1. Prison Song - Weird begining. A veeeery fast song, which is of their early production.Good lyrics, though. Okay. (3/5)<br />2. Needles - Beter than the first one. Terrific lyrics, were getting even some musical talent here... (3.5/5)<br />3. Deer Dance - cool protest on America. (muhahahahaa) good lyrics, better better beeeeeeeetttter music. (4/5)<br />4. Jet pilot - Wow. That's what i call fast. A weird song, i've sometimes written these in school. ;) (3/5)<br />5. X - this is the first time i've heard a GOOD band go \\"diiiiiiiieeeeeee\\". A short piece, boring lyrics. (3/5)<br />6. Chop Suey! - ..............OH MY GOD! perfect lyrics combined with an OK heavy style guitar. I just keep singing along in the end. (543859378/5)<br />7. Bounce - these guys sure can have fun. Kinky lyrics... okay. (3.5/5)<br />8. Forest - another OH MY GOD here. perfect lyrics (again), even the heavy riffs fit well into the slow parts. Sombody said this is an anti-religion song? I thought the guys were pretty religious (considering what they say on the other songs). (5/5)<br />9. ATWA - the fast chorus is done weirdly, but fits well into the rest of the song. (4.5/5)<br />10. Science - wonderful Eastern middle part. perrrrfect. (5/5)<br />11. Shimmy - strange, different lyrics, but okay. (3.5/5)<br />12. Toxicity - AAAAAWWWWWW YEEEAAHHHH! I heard this right when the album came out. At first i HATED it (can you imagine that?), but guess what? now i LOVE it. (463278496/5)<br />13. Psycho - fast, but a good chorus and a stable song. (4.5/5)<br />14. Aerials - smooth. Heavy-sort guitar riffs, peaceful singing. (5/5)<br />(15. What can I say? I can only respect these guys for making something for their homeland.)
B00000JRTX|5.0|When I first time watched it, I fell that it is the highest level for romantic comedy. I still keep that feeling. The characters were so real than ever. The most important part in the movie for me is the The poem by W. H.

B00005JL3A|4.0|After watching the movie on the cinema, I was waiting for the DVD edition.. Before checking out the extras, here is the story:<BR>  The movie tells that, in The Hive, an underground Umbrella Corporation laboratory, a computer who controls the whole laboratory, called Red Queen, killed everyone down there when she found out a virus was released inside. To prevent contamination outside The Hive, Red Queen closed every way out of The Hive and killed everyone. After that, a team is sent to \\"turn out\\" the Red Queen. What will they find? That's what you'll see... (See more about the movie in my Resident Evil - Movie Showtimes Review)<BR>  It's rated R because of Sci-Fi/Horror Violence (zombies, blood, this kind of things you see in the games), language (some f-words, s-words...) ande brief sexuality/nudity (you can see Milla Jovovich's breasts and vagina, real quickly).<BR>  The 5.1 Surround Sound is really good, and so is the image (Widescreen). The main menu is animated, there are the Scene Selections, audio in English and French, caption in English and French.<BR>  The main extras are:<BR>  - Making Of: A basic Making-Of.. How were the main scenes made, some things are said about the Red Queen corridor... You know, it's a Making-Of...<BR>  - Scoring Resident Evil: Tells about the movie sountrack. How was it to be working with the antichrist superstar Marilyn Manson and the classic musician Marco Beltrami? Was it easy? Or was it really hard to mix both styles?<BR>  - Zombie Make-Up Test: It's basically some zombies running around the screen.<BR>  - \\"My Plague\\" Music Video by Slipknot: It's the video of the main song in the movie soundtrack. It mixes and Slipknot show with movie scenes...<BR>  - Cast & Crew Commentary: Paul Anderson (director), Milla Jovovich (Alice), Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) and Jeremy Bolt (producer) make a very interesting and funny audio commentary.. Lots of humor, one of the greatest commentaries ever in my opinion...<BR>  - Costumes: A basic movieexplaining how were the costumes created, how did the cast and crew felt about them...<BR>  - Set design: The name tells everything.. How were the sets designed, what was the most difficult...<BR>  It's worth a buy if you watched it and liked it. If you didn't watch it, just rent it, and see if you like it...
B00005OM4N|5.0|oh oh oh, very good songs on this album of Britney Spears. I like Anticipating the most! But this style of music is far from the style of her previous album, called \\"Oops!...I did it again\\"! But I gotta tell you: Her new style rocs da mic!!!! I love her...:)
B000002NJS|4.0|It's very rare to discover that an album has been hyped up for an actual reason.That's the case right here.This album wasn't one bit over hyped.Listening to it, makes it very clear how much effort went into it.The lyrics are simple, but they have actual meaning.And everyone has to hear the haunting last track&quot;Mer Girl&quot; for some amazing lyrics.This album proves that Madonna is a human being just like the rest of us.Whatever she's done before,this album is like coming out and saying, Yeah, I have a heart.This album is very uplifting and quietly powerful.It's uplifting but not in the neo-soul sunflower child way.It doesn't try and jump at you with a very trite&quot;love urself&quot; message.It simply shows a woman who is calm, and in perspective.Who looks at all her life's happenings, and is capable to go through each of them, to get to her conclusion.While we can all suppose as much we want that Madonna can't sing, the vocals were done very well on this disc.Madonna is proof that you can be expressive, and emotive, and not have 5 octave vocal chords.The production is incredible.It's so unbelievably creative, I can't believe that people actually were capable to think of this.And it wasn't one bit overproduced.It remained very delicate throughout the whole record.And I hate techno music a whole heck of a lot, so the fact that I really found this album to be very good, is saying alot.And behind the million dollar production, lies some genuinely well-written music, strong melodies, without trying to hard to be catchy.That's what real music is about.It's not meant to appeal with a catchy hook, it's melody is meant to subtly caress you.So why four stars?Well, there's a difference between loving an album, or finding it just genuinely well-done/I find it genuinely well-done, but I don't love it, and never will.I also though that the yoga-like chant of shanti/ashtagni was totally not needed, and a little freaky,lol.Even though I don't love this album, I find that it's good music, and I think anyone can enjoy it.It's creative,personal,deep, and well-written.
B00008H2LB|1.0|This cd was such a huge disappointment. To be honest, I didn't even like their first cd all that much. I was hoping that maybe this one would be a little different. Unfortunately, in that year and a half of waiting for this cd, they happened to make Hybrid Theory Part 2. This band doesn't show that they really have any talent whatsoever. They use more samples, thus proving that they need to use other people's music to make their own. Pretty much every song on this album has the same sound and song structure. The only song on this that is even the slightest bit original would have to be track 11. That's the only song I couldn't have sworn I hadn't heard on Hybrid Theory. This definetely is not what I was expecting. Also, it's only 36 minutes long. For my [money] I at least like to get a 40 minute album at the very least. This is just another cd that won't be pulled out unless I tire of any of the other 300 cd's that I own. You want an album that will keep you listening to for years? Go out and buy \\"Lateralus\\" by Tool. I bought that album two years ago and still listen to it every single day, constantly amazed by the raw talent that that band has. \\"Meteora\\" will please the 12 year olds who feel that Korn and Linkin Park are the only people who can understand the \\"pain\\" they are in, but for any other music fan, it will just leave you disappointed.
B00008GKEG|5.0|So much to say, so little space.  Of course, I bought the VHS version when it came out in 1996, and it was great. I thought, even back then, that the sound was a bit disappointing, a bit thin.  When I found out it was coming out on DVD, I was somewhat apprehensive.  After all, A Hard Day's Night was a tremendous disappointment, sound wise.  It was hyped to be in 5.1 Surround, but was actually mono, and hollow, thin mono to boot.<br />So I started with the bonus disc, and I was absolutely blown away.  You get extensive footage of the three together, talking, reminising, playing (WOW!).  You got a bit of that in the original anthology, but just in snippets.  Now, you really get a sense of their time together on this, and of them working together on the two new songs.  Plus, you get, for the first time, the Real Love video mixed in 5.1 Surround.  Absolutely incredible!!!<br />This is 81 minutes of pure heaven for the Beatles fan, and this DVD alone is worth the price of the set.  There really are no words that can do it justice.  One can't help but imagine what it would have been like had John Lennon still been alive when they did this.<br />Then I worked my way through the original Anthology.  Over the years, I've watched the Anthology a number of times, so I'm fairly familiar with the material, and the sound, which, as I mentioned, I thought a bit thin on the VHS version.  As I put on the first DVD, I told myself not to overexpect, that they probably just took the sound from the VHS and transferred it to DVD.<br />Well, I was wrong!!!  Almost all of the music has been remixed in true 5.1 Surround.  I couldn't believe it!!  Of course, the picture quality is outstanding, but I expected that (however, there are segments where certain cuts of video are very dirty, and I don't really understand that).<br />But it's the music that really blew me away.  Some of the biggest surprises: <BR>1. A TRUE surround stereo remix of I Am The Walrus, FROM BEGINNING TO END!!!  I alwaysthought that in the middle of the song, where it switches to rechanneled stereo on the original, it was impossible to ever get a stereo mix becuase they took sounds from a live radio broadcast during mixdown.  But even the radio broadcast is panned from left to right in the rear speakers.  Also, the strings and horns are in stereo, and believe me, I've heard things I've NEVER heard before...and I bet I've listened to that song a thousand times.<br />2. At the very end of the Anthology, there is a short snippet of Sie Liebt Dich, IN TRUE STEREO, with one guitar in either channel.  Maybe there's still a chance we will get to hear a decent stereo version of She Loves You.<br />3. A sadly too short edit of Got To Get You Into My Life.  Any audiophile Beatles fan knows that on the original stereo version, Ringo drums are pretty much buried in the left channel.  On this remix, Ringo's drums are FRONT AND CENTER and MUCH LOUNDER!!!  I got goosebumps on the tom roll that I always struggled to hear.  As I said, such a pity it is so short.<br />I'm only giving three highlights of an unending parade of Beatle songs, mostly edits, that surprise with the Surround remix.  It's an unbelievably wonderful experience.<br />I'm not neccessarily advocating releasing all the Beatles' music in 5.1 Surround, but what this shows is that the quality of the sound we've been hearing on the old CDs is woefully inadequate.  All the songs from Revolver that are featured here are simply an incredible upgrade in sound from the CD; there is no comparision.<br />As great as this DVD set is, in the final analysis, what the Beatles were really about is the music.  Capital/EMI, it is time that you stepped up to the plate and give us Beatles fans what we deserve: the absolute best stereo sound that is now available.  We now know, thanks to this DVD, how much better our precious Beatles albums can sound.  We are counting on you to finally deliver it.<br />For the fans, if you thought that paying one hundred bucks for the VHS version of the Anthology was enough, think again.  The amazing clarity and detail of both the video and audio on this DVD set makes it well worth the investment.  Buy it, watch it, listen to it on a good home audio system, and I'm sure you will agree.
B000077VR3|5.0|I was apprehensive about watching this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The talent is impeccable, the music is exhilirating and sensual and the art direction and cinematography are breathtaking and revolutionary.  <br />Ewan McGregor has become one of my favorite actors after he showcased his talents in this star making role, a real breakout performance for him, in my eyes.  His voice is sweet and gentle, very easy and pleasant to listen to.<BR>Nicole Kidman is gorgeous.  Her voice is angelic.  Her costumes and make up showed off her gorgeous body and her real commanding presence on the screen.  <BR>Jim Broadbent is phenomenal in everything he does (Check out Topsy-Turvy).  His vocal talents are wide, from singing to speaking in his over the top and sometimes goofy, if you will, night club owner/emcee character.  He is the best talent in the film and was worthy of a Supporting Actor Oscar.<BR>John Leguizamo is the unsung hero of the movie.  He is excellent in almost everything of his I've seen (Check out Romeo + Juliet and To Wong Foo: Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar). <br />The music selections, and the original music, as familiar as you may be with the borrowed song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Roxanne and everything from Elephant Love Medley, though ridiculously out of time period, fit the situations and scenarios of the moviw beautifully.  The frenzy of the opening number coupled with Smells Like Teen Spirit, the sensuality and mystery and tension of the Roxanne scene and dance and Ewan's desperation and tenacity during the Elephant Love Medley to get the girl.  The music is full of great beats and unforgettable and tunes, stuff that will keep you humming all day long.  I find myself singing some chorus here or there whenever I'm not thinking.<BR>The stand out song is Come What May, one of the best original songs from the movie and undoubtedly the best.  It is a beautiful love song and an infectious melody and chorus, both showcased by the surprising vocal talents of Ewan and Nicole.<br />Baz Luhrmann is a genius.  His movies, and now his stage production of La Boheme, are signature Baz.  His use of colors, his ability to tell a good story and a good love story is flawless.  His imagery is comparable to that of Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road To Perdition).  There is so much going on on the screen that the words don't need to be there.  You can just watch it to get the idea and that is the sign of a great film maker.<br />It's better than Chicago, but didn't get nearly the awards and recognition it deserved.  It reintroduced the genre of the movie musical to the public and Chicago is, in a way, riding it's coat tails.  Moulin Rouge deserves to be mentioned in every same breath as Best Picture Chicago, an excellent film in it's own right.  But MOULIN ROUGE receives my highest recommendation possible!
B000002BFZ|5.0|hi! i don't really have that much to offer that is different from the other reviews but i would just like to say that my infatuation with pearl jam began upon purchasing TEN. i constantly played that CD for God only knows how long, and then i decided to take my chances and buy each of their other CDs. i had of course heard that NO CODE was awful, no good, not as good as any previous album or yield (this was before binaural or riot act came out), but, i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised. sure, it took me a good 10 or so serious listens before it all sank in, but soon i began to realize that from start to finish it truely is a complete work of art.(and hey, at least we all got some poloroid photos, right?)<BR>some of the top picks from the album are &quot;hail, hail&quot;, a great rocker dealing with someone questioning a relationship; &quot;in my tree&quot;; &quot;smile&quot;, where Ed amazingly both sings and plays harmonica; &quot;off he goes&quot;; &quot;red mosquito&quot;, which visits the idea of which i'm sure we've all had at one time: if we could only go back and change something or if we had known then what we know now; &quot;lukin&quot;, probably my favorite 'rocker' on the album, is set as a, supposedly, true day in the life of eddie vedder; &quot;present tense&quot; is a beautiful, beautiful song (i especially like the guitar parts towards the end); and &quot;makind&quot;, although sung by STONE gossard is a great song as well. the only songs on the album that are not up to par in my opinion are &quot;habit&quot;, which i cannot listen to for the life of me; and &quot;i'm open&quot;, which isn't that great either.
B000089A07|4.0|Red Dragon should be remembered in the Hannibal Lector series for being the one of the three most accurately translated from novel to theaters. Aside from following the book well, it is still a decent movie! Whereas the novel is a very tedious read due to its overtechnical attempt at clocking the forensics of a crime scene, The movie manages to capture an amazing story. The way this movie was filmed gives it an increadibly nightmarish feel. It moves fast in all the right ways, touching briefly on the forensics and delving in depth into the mind games and plots of his horror genre majesty Hannibal Lector. For a blast from the past you may also want to examine &quot;Manhunter&quot; the origional version of this movie featuring a great actor: Brian Cox (Supertroopers, LIE...) in the role of Hannibal.
0743216458|5.0|BAND OF BROTHERS is one of the best WWII books I have ever read. It is so imformative, it tells you everything. You really get to know what the men of Easy Company felt like when they were in the front lines.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is a band that has literally exploded into the music industry. I heard about them one day and the next day they had escalated to tying as my #1 band (with Kutless as the other #1). I can't recommend this group highly enough.

B00005JJX8|5.0|What a great experience it has been to watch this long-cherished Hitchcock film, on DVD format, thus watching it in full glory, Widescreen (Vistavision), with crisp, sharp images, brilliant colors, etc....after of years of watching faded, full screen prints on TV. On top of this, you get excellent bonuses: excellent documentaries, comments, still galleries,... What more can I say? Paramount is doing its best with their classics!...<br />Top performances by the very attractive two leads' (Kelly and Grant)....in fact Kelly never looked so ravishing and gorgeous than here, only perhaps in \\"The Swan\\" (1956)....being one the most sensual, elegant and beautiful women of all time....a Real Goddess-come-to-earth.....How can someone so perfect did ever exist!And besides talented!Grant his usual man-of-the-world, excellent timing, top actor and comedian.<br />Great support by the wonderful character actor John Williams and by everybody's favorite sophisticated mother: Jessie Royce Landis (although here she plays a woman of humble origins who became rich because of Oil being found in her Oklahoma Ranch-anyway she looks and behaves like a Queen) and by French grand actor Charles Vanel.<br />And what about those great landscapes of the South of France (Cannes, Monaco, Côte D'Azûr,...), breathtaking!!<br />Vintage Hollywood Classic.
0345457684|4.0|Morgan does one of the most effective jobs I have yet seen mixing the hard-boiled detective genre with sci-fi/cyberpunk.  Kovacs is one mean ex-Corpsman who only gets out of the prison stacks if someone finds a job for him-- and there are precious few jobs for violent, brilliant borderline-psychotics out there...<br /><br />Morgan combines enough technology details to satisfy most cyberpunk fans, but miraculously enough keeps his eye on the ball for the mystery. The plot would be just as suitable in a Chandler novel or a Travis McGee book if the 26th century detailing was removed. The book unfortunately gets points off for not knowing how to end; the conclusion is not as satisfying as it should be given everything that comes before.<br /><br />A great read, and I will look forward to the next Kovacs installment. Should appeal to hard-boiled mystery and cyberpunk fans.
0316666343|1.0|Ugh, is all I can say. This book relies for impact on some mixture of prurience and sentimentality, without acknowledging that it's doing so. Its characters are flimsy at best. And the author is unable to disguise her own self-satisfaction and self-importance. Okay, the writing is competent in a very lowest common denominator way but so what? Competent writing is a dime a dozen. Above all, this book's fatal flaw is that it's boring. ...
0553573403|4.0|One might ask in reading this review \\"Is this book good?\\" well i can honestly say yes it is. Is it the best? no. First of all while it is a fanatasy it is not all that fantastical. No magic swords or vastly powerful wizards. that isn't necessarily bad, with all the modern authors who stuff their books to the gills with spells and gods and magically invincible heroes,bu you feel like it is not actually a fantasy. Instead of magic Martin puts in political intriuge which isn't how most fantasies convey their point. Most fantasies will go after an emotional or religous theme and breaking away from that isn't bad either but it can give you a throbbing headache. Also the content isn't really all the friendly, with cursing, vast amounts of bloodshed, tons of sexual refrences (including some incest. Martin uses these to a great and unique effect in his book to show the hardships of his world, while most writers merely use sex and violence to make their books \\"cooler\\". And lastly the characters. The way Martin writes it you can never truely like the good guys and you can not really hate the bad guys which got me kind of annoyed but the characters were so well written that you can't help but be intrigued by them all. So in the end i definatly recomend it as a novel though not necessarily as a fantasy. There are better books though i won't name any since each person has Her/His own views. So go! Buy this book if you like political intrigue or if you like a good book but not if you need a fantasy fix
B00008H2LB|4.0|... Yes nu mental is not all that great anymore but linkin is the exception. They are the best in that caterory. ... Of course it should be based toward that because thats what made them popular. It would be dumb to change it alot, because than they could drop fast and nerver be heard of again! Ok to the abulm, its great!! if you like hybrid theroy you will like this. Its little bit more harder and has more melody. I give it a four instead of a five because of the length.  Worth the money.
B00007K08H|5.0|This is my second-favorite French movie after Le Grand Chemin. The French language was a little fast, so thank goodness for the subtitles. Pair that with closed captioning, and nothing was missed. The scene with the couple in the bathroom is HILARIOUS.<br />As you might expect, the French expect you to watch this with a grown-up sensibility; meaning they have what I consider a healthy view of sex. At any rate, it comes up a lot in this movie. Ah bon! The real title is the Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain. If you have more than a little high school French you figure that out.<br />The actresses who play Amelie are adorable, both the six-year-old, and the 22-year-old! The older one is especially engaging, with her big eyes and cute haircut, but I gotta ask, do all young French women dress like Olive Oyl?? Amelie has an odd sense of fashion, for sure.<br />Anyway, this movie gave me a really good laugh. Unfortunately, they wouldn't show it in Puritan Oklahoma City, but I'm happy to see it many, many times at home on my VCR. I recommend it highly!<br />It's nice to know that even an outcast can find love!
B00006X06U|1.0|I was so looking forward to this album.  Orchestrated Joni Mitchell.  Should be exciting, no?  NO!  Mitchell's voice is no longer the smooth, lovely sound it used to be due to her excessive smoking habit.  It's just painful to listen to this and then remember what was.  Her singing has not grown in the least; her voice has just deepened and gotten husky.  The orchestrations do nothing to enhance her songs or her singing.  Too bad.
B0000639IJ|3.0|Ali is a decent bio of Mohammad Ali's boxing career. Will Smith certainly elevates the performance of the film.  Its amusing to listen to Will imitate Ali as he talks trash before his big fights and to Howard Cossel.  Also the actor who portrays Howard Cossel does him good justice.<br />However, the story is a bit incomplete.  The story cuts right to the first Sonny Liston fight with little introduction on Ali's growing up period.  Than there is the focus on his dodging the draft and his spiritual role as a Muslim.  This is given decent emphasis.  Finally some coverage of his fights with Frazier, Quarry, and Foreman.  Somehow it would have been nice of the movie included some mention of the second and third fights with Frazier and even  Ali past his prime.<br />Nonetheless, the fight scenes are exciting and even in its limtied focus, the movie is good if not spectacular.
B00000J2SO|5.0|A lot of people seem disappointed with this album because it's not a Dio album, but Graham Bonnet is an excellent singer in his own right and this album has many great merits of its own. It's hard to say which album is Rainbow's best, because their albums sound so different from each other that it comes down to a matter of taste. While I feel that &quot;Long Live&quot; was their best album with Dio, I prefer this album overall because it is so different from anything else. I don't think that this is an attempt at a commercial album, other than &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot;, but it had to be very different because the personnel changed so drastically from the previous album. Graham Bonnet's voice is nothing like Dio's, or anyone else's for that matter. He's got a unique sound and style, leather lungs, and is a better lyricist than Dio. (Quick: name any album with any band containing Dio that doesn't have a song with a &quot;life is like a wheel&quot; lyric.) Don Airey writes the book on hard rock keyboard playing on this album: rather than relying on the old standby organ, he uses a variety of keys and synths, leaning towards their harder sounds. The result is a more colorful but not softer sound.<BR>Just as Dio recycles lyrics, Blackmore recycles riffs. &quot;All Night Long&quot; is the rerun here, with life kicked into it by Bonnet's energetic vocals. &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; is a great keyboard-driven track, with another great vocal and killer guitar lead. The keyboards are much more up front on this album, as Airey is the first (only?) Rainbow keyboardist who was up to the task of complementing Blackmore. I remembered &quot;No Time To Lose&quot; and &quot;Makin' Love&quot; as throwaways, though listening recently made me change my mind about &quot;Makin' Love&quot;. It's not bad, but not quite as good as the other songs here, leaving &quot;No Time&quot; as the only dog of this album. &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot; has radio airplay written all overit, but not annoyingly so, as it is a good song with good playing and doesn't go overboard with vocal harmonies. The whole of side two is a killer: &quot;Love's No Friend&quot; is a bluesy crusher, kind of like &quot;Mistreated&quot; but with better lyrics and vocals. Graham Bonnet is not afraid to bring emotion into his lyrics and singing, and it adds a lot of realness to his songs that a lot of bands would do well to copy. &quot;Danger Zone&quot; is a good fast tune, and &quot;Lost in Hollywood&quot; would be a classic in any just universe. Probably the fastest song Rainbow ever did, it closes the album out with a bang and makes me angry that there's only one of that song. (On Alcatrazz's live album, you can hear the band launching into it in the fade-out of one of the other tracks. Shame that didn't make the album). <BR>This album's very good, just keep an open mind and understand that it's not as heavy as their previous albums (Side two excepted). That doesn't make it any less of a great album, and it's definitely not in the class of the uninspired albums which were to follow. (Side note: at a concert on the &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; tour, a friend turned to me and said, &quot;I've seen better warmup bands&quot;. Sadly, he was right. Blackmore really must have been sleepwalking. Krokus had opened, and a couple of days later I was shocked to flip on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and hear Rick James' guitarist shred anybody I'd seen at that concert. I guess some guys really get bored with touring. I caught Blackmore again a couple of years later with Purple, and he was back in form). Anybody who enjoys this would do well to check out &quot;Assault Attack&quot;, the album Graham Bonnet recorded with the Michael Schenker Group. There's a reason he was in bands with some of the world's greatest guitarists: he's that good. (Apparently, he's also unstable and incredibly hard to get along with, which is why he's been in so many bands).
0345440900|5.0|I loved this book!  There may not be a manual for raising babies, but this book helped me so much by helping me understand my baby.  I wish Tracy Hogg had a website for daily encouragement and help--she gives practical suggestions and explains things so that it all makes sense.  Most of all, she helps you enjoy the baby you have instead of telling you how to make your baby into the baby you think you should have.  I've been buying this book as a baby gift for everyone I know when they have a baby!  The book is easy to read in bits and pieces--which is great since most new moms don't have long periods of time available for reading.
B000002KKS|5.0|Black Sabbath made their mark in the early seventies with the sheer incredible power of \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Master of Reality\\". Though later albums contained great tracks, especially \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", they never really approached the brutal drive of those two albums. Ronnie Dio's hiring really rejuvenated this band, and \\"Heaven and Hell\\" was the first album in nearly ten years to capture that ferocious power. The sound is a little different- much more professional, which is why Ozzy sneeringly referred to them as \\"Blackmore Sabbath\\". But there's no sneering at this album. It picks the pace way up from where they had been, and Dio's more operatic voice fit them perfectly. Every cut here is a killer; \\"Wishing Well\\" and \\"Walk Away\\" less so, because if you've heard any of Dio's other albums (solo or with Rainbow) you'll find these annoyingly familiar. The title track is a deep dark mystical trip with a ferocious ending, \\"Children of the Sea\\" and \\"Neon Knights\\" are great cuts, and the finish is slamming. \\"Die Young\\" is a terrific speed-rush of a song, and \\"Lonely is the Word\\" has some of Iommi's best guitar work. In fact, most of Iommi's best guitar work is on this album. \\"Lonely\\" and the quiet ending of the title track are nice and necessary cool-downs from the intensity that came before them. You need to do two things: 1) Get this album and 2) play it very loud. Wait till the neighbors are gone, and crank it very loud. It will make your other albums sound bad.
078062999X|5.0|Hamlet the text, literature by it self is amazing uncomparable. This play embodies a work of genius. I read the play in my freshman year. I understood it and I took away the major point, but it was not until I saw this amazing production that I fully understood the depth of this piece. Kenneth Branagh is the best actor of our time. He can take the role of Hamlet, literatures most profound character, and express it the way, I believe, Shakspere would want it done. This production does not cut out any of the play, which is how it should be done. You can not take a play, by the best writer ever and cut out what you think isn't important. This film does the play justice. If you have read the play see this, the play will take on a whole new light. What I like in this production is the comical side that Branagh can bring in just a little. EXample: when he saids words words words he makes this sort of face which is just hillarious. He huminazes this character for us. Kate Winslet I believe was brilliant in this and is underestimated as an actress. Just becuase she was in titanic does not mean that she has sold out. I would like to see here in more of these types of roles. I have never been so affected by a work as this one. After seeing this movie the play shakspere everything took on a new meaning. I am know in the 10th grade and I think that in high school we should have to take a Shakspere class and this movie should be shown and analyzed. This production is worth the four hours and should be watched after reading the play.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Interesting chord sequences, bass line and in some cases, even mixtures of multiple ideas... orchestra with an Indian music-like arrangement with a seemingly &quot;monotonous&quot; bass voice, lead guitar and 70's-like bass. The man's a genius... Well worth it!
B00003CXXO|5.0|This movie is a tender, gentle and deeply moving artistic masterpiece. More art than commerce, more minimalism than muscularlism (action); it is as if it belongs more in a fine arts museum than in the video store...! Spielberg is a genius of his own kind. Kubrick shurely would have approved!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I just got the dvd yesterday (4/11/03)and immediatly started to play with the features even before I watched the film again. I have to say that the features are a hundred times better than the first dvd, even though it still has some stuff that I find to be annoying. Features are easy to access, and the best part is by far the deleted scenes and interviews. The most annoying part, those damn games that are just there. I won't go into any details b/c there are still thos ewho have not yet got the dvd. As for the movie itself, I must say, Grade-A work. Being a fan of the books, the movie does it pretty much a good amount of justice. Some parts may not work with the book but when you consider the length of the books, the way the writer condensced it, it works well enough. The acting is progressing along side the characters development, and I have no problems with them. If you liked the books, get the movie, I highly reccomend it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I don't care if this entire world that's mostly full of people who either hate the Beach Boys or only think of them as a surf/car band think or will think that Pet Sounds is overrated/dull/corny/whatever. I'm not as bitter about emoting one's self as they seem to be. I don't care about whether it stacks up with Sgt Pepper (I always thought that album was a step down in song quality from the perfect Revolver, but that's just me). One influenced the other, and that's it. I don't even care how many times it tops the lists as best album of all time. I don't think that sort of thing is possible, and it only leads to backlash, like on here. I just know that Pet Sounds changed my life, that at the end of the day, when I play it, i feel love and mercy and acceptance. It's my favorite album out of my hundreds of CDs. If music's my religion, then Pet Sounds is my bible. Thanks, Brian Wilson.<BR>And, to paraphrase my favorite song of all time: &quot;i wish that every listen was neverending, oh wouldn't it be nice?&quot;
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's third album is by far their best one. The only thing that i can find wrong with it is that it does sound the same and the hardcore guitar solos arnet there,(ala trippin, immune and bad religion). Before i bought this CD I was wondering 2 things: Can they possibly do better than thier smash hit single AWAKE, and could SERENITY be as good as VOODOO and SPIRAL.(granted nothing will be as good as VOODOO). My answer to both of those questions are YES! The song that is as good as Awake is FACELESS. WHen that thing hits the air waves it is going to wreek hell. In my opinion it is thier best song by far. SERENITY isnt as good as VOODOO but better than SPIRAL. AS for the other songs CHANGES is very up beat, MAKE ME BELIEVE seems a little differnt in the tone that it is in. RE-ALIGN has a badass chorus that was stuck in my head for dayz. I F****** HATE YOU has alot of power behind it as far as Erna's voice tone. RELEASING THE DEMONS and DEAD AND BROKEN pretty good songs. The second best song on this CD is I AM. THis song has been stuck in my head ever since i heard it. I strongly suggest buying this album for any rock fan out there.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The two towers was a wonderful movie.  A great sequel to the fellowship.  We follow the lives of our young heros through torment and danger.  While we see the fellowship on to their quest in saving Middle Earth.  Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum their untrustworthy guide.  Merry and Pippin get lost in the forest with some Ents.  Aragorn Gimli and Legolas search for the Hobbits but find someone they dont suspect.  Arwen is traveling to the undying lands(I dont think so?!)  All in All this movie is a must see!!
B00008URYM|2.0|I had big expectations for American Life. The lyrics lived up to them. No one can argue that Madonna has great insight into the trappings of fame, but we've heard it all before (remember Substitute for Love?). That aside, there is only one reason to buy this song, and that is for the beautiful, beautiful chorus. Madonna could have taken that chorus and made a beautiul ballad out of it, but she didn't. (With the recent success of songs such as Beautiful by Christina Aguilera, I think it could have been a hit). She also could have made a killer techno/dance song, but the synthesized background effects seem VERY watered down. It does seem like the B-side of the single. If she wanted this to be a good techno song that hinted of war terror, why did she not do some really scary stuff with the synthesizers? Also why not throw in some background voices (remember Like A Prayer?). This song could have been hauntingly beautiful, but it's not. I just have to ask, is Madonna capable of beautiful ballads any more (like Take a Bow) or is she just too afraid to risk having a flop song, trading quality music for chart status and club play? Wow, that's really low.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Although I thought the Sorcerer's Stone movie was a disaster, I saw this movie because I am a fan of the Harry Potter books, and plan on seeing every movie. The problem with the movie, &quot;Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; was that Columbus failed to add anything that wasn't in the book, making the movie seem flat, and sometimes boring. The special effects were horribly done. You couldn't help looking at Voldemort and not think, &quot;computer animation.&quot;<br />NOT TRUE HERE. Chamber of Secrets is amazing. The special effects were the best I've seen in a long time, and they are espechily amazing when you look at the creatures. During some of the action scenes, you forget that the things are computer creations. Not only that, but Columbus, this time, adds MORE. The final battle was not RIGHT out of the book like it was in the first movie. The final battle featured many more different things happening, and, in a different order. This made even people who read the book nervous during these scenes, because, since it is not right from the book, you don't know what's going to happen. This movie features a lot of humor, much more than in the Sorcerer's Stone. The action scenes are top-notch, and it makes me wonder why Columbus doesn't make action movies. He knows exactly how to completely surprise those watching the movie. The acting was great. Once again, improved from the Sorcerer's Stone. <br />This movie is not for young kids. While seeing the movie, I noticed that parents around me were grumbling during the intense final battle scene about how upset they were that this movie was not rated PG13. Personally, while I don't think this movie was PG13 material, it does verge on PG13 material. And I think that is necessary. The Harry Potter books are not exactly &quot;Goldilocks and the the Three Bears.&quot; This movie needed thrills, it needed some violence, and it was appropriately added. It is one of the scarriest Harry Potter books made. Critics complain about this film being too intense; Well, wait until they see the 4th movie!<br />My only problems were that many of the deleted scenes really SHOULD have been in the movie, and that the muggle-born issue was not NEARLY as focused on as it was in the book. And the fact that the ending seemed kind of rushed. The ending; one of the biggest problems with the movie. Columbus has a scene at the end of the movie which makes you wonder what he was thinking. First of all, in the book, Hermione did not hug Harry at the end. J.K. Rowling even commented on this (in the interview that's on the DVD) saying that this sort of thing did not happen until the fourth book. Not only that, but.....well, just watch the scene. You can easily tell that it was not in the book.<br />Other than that, this movie is a must-own, and definately puts the first movie to complete shame. Alfonso Cuaron will be directing the 3rd Harry Potter movie. I hope he does as good of a job as Columbus did on this movie.
B000003TAW|4.0|I was reading reviews by some kid and he mentioned how so many people give 5 stars to albums so readily, but often undeservedly. I have fallen into this trap numerous times, and from now on, my liberal 5 star giving will be inhibited, e.g. this cd. I probably would have given this cd 5 stars just because tracks like Holiday, Only In Dreams, Buddy Holly, and Say It Ain't So clearly make the cd a classic that everyone should buy, but, I'm forced to give it 4 because of weak tracks like No One Else, Surf Wax America, and yes The Sweater Song. Sorry, I just don't think The Sweater Song is any good. However, there's no need to worry about the poor tracks on this cd; the good ones compensate well enough. Buddy Holly has to be one of the best songs of the 90s, and Say It Ain't So, Holiday, and Only In Dreams are all equable to any good, hit song by any band (although I'm not usually fond of the hits) around. So, support weezer, buy their records, they're a great great band.
0345442970|4.0|Lately, I've become more convinced than ever by the argument that George Lucas erred when he decided to make the story of the Fall of the Republic as three movies; he should have made it a television series, or at least three separate mini-series'.  The reason?  There is far too much going on around the characters, far too much subtle nuance coloring motivations and actions, to adequately cover in a handful of two-hour snippets.  Thankfully, at least, there are the novels to fill in the gaps, and I'm pleased to say that Cloak of Deception does so admirably.<br />The novel is arranged something like a Ludlum thriller minus the phonebook-like page count: bad deeds are afoot, some not very nice people are either manipulating or being manipulated into positions for unknown reasons, an audacious plan is set in motion the purpose of which we do not know, and it's all up to Qui-Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi-Wan to gather up the clues and save the day.  The action starts from practically the opening page and it never really lets up, and it all leads up to an ending that is as thrilling as it is clever.  If you like action-filled stories, it's hard not to like this one.  The writing is well done and even has a somewhat droll sense of humor to it, and the pace keeps you guessing long enough to want to turn that next page.<br />But how does this all connect with my first point?  Well, along the way we get a good dose of the machinations and tensions going on within the Republic, especially those centering around a certain Senator from Naboo.  One of the really nifty aspects I like about Cloak of Deception is that it attempts to maintain the fiction that we really don't know that Palpatine and Sideous are one and the same (which we are not suppose to \\"officially\\" find out until the third movie).  This gives the story a certain degree of mystery, a \\"what the hell is this guy up to?\\" quality that is curiously missing from the first two movies.  Politics plays a major role here, and the action is a symptom of something going on that is much larger and far more ominous than most of the characters know.  You can't fill all of this in over a mere two hours; you can only skim the surface and gather up the chunks at the top, and unfortunately the movies suffer somewhat because of this.  Still, as I said, at least the novels are there, and Cloak of Deception fills in a lot of the sorely needed background behind The Phantom Menace.  Overall, a very good entry in the series.
0671027344|4.0|i wont go into detail, but this book is a great example of what kids go through nowadays when they are teenagers. some of the things that charlie went through, i was going through at the same time. the biggest similarity was the making the right or wrong choices. this was a great book, but i gave it only 4 stars because it didnt grasp me like other books had. (if you like this book, i recommend SMACK by melvin burgess because it is very similar)
B000089RV6|5.0|... Earlier this spring, I was watching the rock and roll hall of fame induction special on VH1 and caught the induction of AC/DC. I found myself enjoying their performance a lot. Nice to know that some things haven't changed and AC/DC's brand of bluesy hard rock is one of those constant presences in life that you're glad that it hasn't changed. After the special, I put \\"Back in Black\\" on my mental wish list of cds that I had to have. Much to my surprise, I found a copy of the new remastered version of the cd ... I immediately snatched it up. I haven't heard this album in over ten years and much to my amazement, the music sounds as fresh as it did back in the late '80s, early '90s for me. The familiar power chords of the Young brothers, the thunderous rhythm section of Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams, and the amazing howling from Brian Johnson sounds as amazing as did for me in high school. The cd sounds even more incredible when the volume has been cranked up. Songs like \\"Hells Bells\\" and the perennial classic \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" are mindblowing to say the very least. I feel like I have rediscovered an old friend with \\"Back in Black\\". Truly one of the best rock and roll albums of all time, at least for me.
B00005J6T1|5.0|In the beginning, Madonna was a disco star, reflected in this fine album. It contains three major international hits - Holiday, Lucky star and Borderline - that helped to set Madonna on her way to superstardom.<br />Lucky star, a perky, upbeat song, opens this set and is followed by the mellower Borderline. However, by far the biggest hit here is Holiday, which was a UK top ten hit on three completely separate occasions, just missing the top spot on two of them, as well as being a major hit in many other countries. The last track, Everybody, was very popular in the discos, though (as far as I know) it was not released as a single. It would surely have been a big hit had it been released as a single back then. While the other tracks here lack the brilliance of those four, or of her later album tracks, this was a promising debut.<br />Madonna's subsequent albums often have a disco appeal but bring in many other influences. Although this is not an essential album to the casual fan, no committed Madonna fan should be without it.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of pop music by all means but every now and then I will make an exception because the artist/band actually has talent and puts out music that isn't so contrived and ridiculously cheesy (in a bad way). Robbie Williams is one of those pop artists whose music is actually enjoyable to listen to. I loved his covers album &quot;Swing When You're Winning&quot; but that cd was only available as an import. &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot; was good but it was a flawed album. Still that album is by far better than Avril Lavigne, Vanessa Carlton, and Pink's albums combined. Robbie's US debut &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot; was a solid [US] debut album with one or two misses on a mostly consistent album. Why Robbie isn't popular in this country is beyond me? After listening to &quot;Escapology&quot; I sure hope he doesn't get the shaft again by the American public. &quot;Escapology&quot; is by far Robbie's best album released on this side of the Atlantic ocean. I guess people don't get his cheeky British humor like on the song &quot;Me and My Monkey&quot; and on &quot;Rock DJ&quot; from &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot;. What I like about Robbie Williams so much is that he doesn't take himself remotely seriously unlike his American peers Justin Timberlake (blech!) and Christina Aguilera. I think Robbie's songwriting skills have improved over the years. Although he still collaborated with longtime writing partner Guy Chambers, Robbie has branched out and wrote a few songs with Boots Ottestad and even one song &quot;One Fine Day&quot; by himself. All the songs are incredibly infectious and catchy. I loved every song on this cd and didn't find one I didn't like unlike his previous albums. I sure hope Robbie gets the recognition that he so deserves now that he is on a different record company. Capital Records did a horrible job of [not] promoting Robbie as an artist. &quot;Escapology&quot; deserves the publicity and airplay as any other pop artist receives.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|... This is one of the best cds that haa come out this year, and let me tell you I was majorly impressed, as I pretty much expected to happen. Faceless is Godsmack's heaviest effort, and I think one of the reasons is because of the new drummer. Godsmack is one of the best bands out there today, they produce such raw energy when they play it's scary. The only problem I have with them though, is that they say \\"away\\" too much. But their lyrics, although not the greatest in the world, do possess a ton of aggression ESPECIALLY \\"I (Fudge)ing Hate You,\\" whoever Sully was referring to in this song makes me glad to not be that person. I can't name any favorites off this cd, I like them all equally. I love how Godsmack always ends their albums with a \\"Voodoo\\"-type song, last cd it was \\"Spiral,\\" this time it's the twisted \\"Serenity.\\" And wouldn't you know it, they start it off with some sort of a tribal musical number called \\"The Awakening.\\" I'm sure by now most of you have heard both \\"Straight Out of Line\\" and \\"I Stand Alone\\" (which I never though for a second that it was going to be on this album). They are terrific additions to this heavy-arse album, Godsmack are THE replacement for Metallica, which needed to be done in the first place considering Metallica are a bunch of whiny sell-outs now. Godsmack (or anyone else for that matter) will NEVER be able to contend with the best band in the world, Tool, but their talents do shine everytime, and with this cd it has been proven, Godsmack are here to stay.:D
B00008O31H|5.0|If you like hard, grinding, sexy, nasty godawful blues music, GET THIS FREAKING CD!!!! Do not wait, this disc has life altering possibilities.

0385504209|5.0|The plot for me was the great winner of this book. The characters were average but the exceptional plot was one of the most interesting and shocking that I can remember. For a cracking good yarn, &quot;Read this Book&quot;.
B000005DSN|4.0|Neo-Classic Metal is awesome because it combines 2 good genres to create an awesome sound of heavy guitarts, bass, and drums, combined with raisin violins and full orchestras and great choral arrangement. This album does this increadibly well, the keyboard arrangements are made extremely well, while the guitarwork of Tolkki is perfect. The only weak point might be the vocals, but that seems to be an aquired taste for nearly all bands of this genre.<br />1. Kiss of Judas- 9/10 Obviusly, about the Kiss that betrayed Christ, nice song, one of the best.<BR>2. Black Daimond-10/10 The awesome single, probably the best song, especially for the awesome solo and the infectious keyboards.<BR>3. Forever Free- 9/10 Nice choruses, nice lyric<BR>4. Before the Winter- 8.5/10 Slower, ballad-like song  <BR>5. Legions- 8.5/10 Some awesome guitar-work, as usual<BR>6. Abyss of Your Eyes- 8/10 A bit slower as well.<BR>7. Holy Light- 9/10 Lightning-fast guitars, great instrumental<BR>8. Paradise- 6/10 People are right, the lyrics are really bad, the music is sub-par too, the choruses are the only redeeming aspect.<BR>9. Coming Home- 9.5/10 The most awesome ballad on the CD<BR>10. Visions- 10/10 10-minute epic about Nostradamus's predictions (hence &quot;Visions&quot;), can get a bit slow at points, but overall awesome.
B0000640VO|5.0|This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen.  After seeing some other Jeunet, like Alien Ressurection, I was not expecting something so well-executed.  I loved everything about this film!  From the opening, we begin to enter the fantasy world of Amelie.  The photography is incredible and surrealistic.  It sets a nice mood for the film.  There's nothing too original about this film (French New Wave is an obvious influence), but it melds a bundle of different ideas  into a perfect mixture.  I really recommend this to everyone.  This is in no way a chick flick!  Sure, there's not a lot of action, but it sure is fun!
0151008116|4.0|This is Martel's second novel, and the winner of last year's Booker Prize.  It tells the story of 16-year old Pi Patel, a young zookeeper's son, who ends up stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean with a 450 pound Bengal tiger named Parker on board with him.  The circumstances leading up to Patel's being stranded on the raft and the unbelievable experiences he goes through, along with his overactive imagination, are what make this book truly exciting and a joy to read.  It makes you wonder if you were in the same circumstances, would you be able to survive at sea alone for 227 days.  The first part of the book discusses the idea of incorporating the world's religions and it seemed to drag on much too long.  The story redeemed itself in the second half with the boy's adventure on the sea, and the complicated and unexpected turn of events that bring the story to a close. <BR> <br />There was much more to this story than I expected.  It's true, I didn't care for some parts of it, but I was very impressed with the second half of the book, and surprised by the way it ended.  It will make you think about what is and isn't reality.  It's a book to contemplate and read more than once.  This is one of those books I will always remember!<br />Joe Hanssen
B00005YUPO|5.0|If my baby likes it, I like it. She likes this one a lot. Her favorite part is the sparkly balls at the beginning and the spinning top. My favorite part is the lightning ball. Before someone bought this for me and we tried it out, I was very anti-sit-your-baby-in-front-of-the-tv, but I think these \\"digital board books\\" are fine as long as it's not an everyday thing (I think the \\"repeat play\\" option is not a great idea) and you actually interact with your child during the show as they recommend. Granted, it can be a boring show for the grownup at times, especially after you know it by heart - and you will - however, the final word is if it makes my baby happy it makes me happy.
B00008H2LB|5.0|That is the word that I think best describes this album.  You will probably have to listen to it a few times before you can truely enjoy it, but after listening to it for 2 weeks strait, that is the one word conclusion that I have come to.  For me, I found it to be one of those albums that just grows on you, and gets better and better with every listen.  Is it better than Hybrid Theory?    Well, even though Hybrid Theory is the album that introduced the world to Linkin Park, I still have to say YES...... this album is actually a little better.  It has more to offer.  You get the classic Linkin Park sound, along with some heavier and even some softer, classic rock and roll sound.  They are true musicians.  If you liked their last album, do yourself a favor and buy this album.  If you are just a fan of great music, you really should get this album.  This is something that any real music fan will enjoy.  After all, it ranks in my top 5 albums of ALL TIME.  Just for a reference, I rank Meteora higher than Nevermind (by Nirvana), and Back in Black (by ACDC).  Linkin Park has really done an amazing job.  A lot of todays music is pretty much worthless, but Linkin Park definitely knows what they are doing.  they are the greatest band of recent years.  As the saying goes, Big things come in Small packages.  Meteora is simply Great Quality Music.
0393317552|5.0|Diamond's approach is &quot;big history&quot;.  That is, he takes the long view, time-wise, and incorporates many other fields, such as biology and geography.  This book is fascinating reading and changed my outlook on life.

B000002JS6|5.0|If you want to cool out and relax don't put this album on. This is some really heavy rock & roll. If you find this CD in a juke box at a bar then you have the perfect combination. Find a pool table and rack 'em up and \\"Have a Drink on Me\\". This album hit like a sucker punch in 1980 and is still some of the hardest rock you will ever hear. It just doesn't get old. As you get older you probably won't want to hear it as often because your nerves may not be able to take it. Not for the faint of heart.
B000089CJI|5.0|upon hearing that ben gibbard had another project, of course i immediately rushed out to buy this album.  i'm still rather undecided on it, however.  it alternates between breathtakingly beautiful and absolutely cringe-worthy.  for every clever little lyric there's an equally corny line.<br />nonetheless: the album is bouncy, happy (even when it's sad), and quite good for in-the-car-listening, especially on a summer's day with the windows down.  a good sing-along album and definitely a wonderful collaboration of the artists involved.<br />verdict: buy it.  also be sure to get the shins &amp; the iron&amp;wine covers of their songs.  quite fantastic.
B000089RVX|5.0|First off, I buy a lot of CD's. Music is my life. And if you ask me, music has been in a slump for a while. You know, where everything sounds the same, and we all sit around waiting for another Nirvana, or some other band that breaks the trend, starting new forms of music. While Evanescence may not break any musical molds, they are definitly a breath of fresh air. So often I'll hear a CD, and no matter how many times I listen to it, something is missing. Evanescence is one of the few bands in a long time where every song sounds \\"full.\\" While covering a wide range, each song leaves the listener feeling that nothing needs to be added or taken away. <BR>I was glad to see that the main singles off the CD were \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" and \\"My Immortal,\\" since these two songs perfectly show Evanescence's wide range as well as their lyrical abilities. They sing of things much deeper than what might be heard originally. For instance, upon first listen many people hear \\"My Immortal,\\" and pass it off as just another love song. If you stop and listen, you'll hear a deep and meaningfull song about a love and comfort waiting for us all despite all we may have done in life.<BR>Besides being a tremendous CD, Evanescence sends a message needed now more than ever.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Just like the Godfather DVD Collection, why DVD was invented.  This DVD edition of the BBC's Beatles Anthology is worth every penny, including the extras.  I've watched all the discs and am extremely impressed with how Apple Corps has issued this on DVD, especially at a great price ... Apple went as far as remixing the audio to DTS asides from the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, which is quite impressive.  Video quality rocks compares to VHS (always of course!  i'd give it a 4 out of 5 for vid quality).  The Bonus Disc is the cream of the crop in this collection.  It has extra jams of the surviving Beatles doing their Hamburg days songs (covers mostly).  Then there is an awesome short of them with producer George Martin analyzing two Beatles songs and how they mixed it, etc.  Probably the most interesting is a short documentary on how they recorded \\"Free As a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\", along with \\"Making of\\" the two videos ... Well worth the buy, especially for the Bonus Disc.  Did I mention there's 5 more hours than the ABC release in 1995? WELL WORTH THE BUY!
B000089A07|1.0|After watching &quot;Red Dragon&quot; I was reminded of how brilliant &quot;Manhunter&quot; really is. The biggest flaw is with the casting. Edward Norton is a great actor, but I never believed him for one minute in this movie. If you remember William Peterson from &quot;Manhunter&quot; he was a guy dealing with torment after catching Hannibal. Peterson lets us know how he feels just through his eyes. Norton never really convinces me that he is tormented and crazy from his work. He always seems the same. Norton suprisingly makes the character very one-dimensional, never really getting at the thru-lines that Peterson did.<br />Same goes for Anthony Hopkins and Ralph Finnes. In no way possible are these two actors as chilling as Brian Cox or Tom Noonan. Noonan made his &quot;tooth fairy&quot; one of the most chilling villians in movie history. Ralph Finnes is too normal looking and conventional to be truly scary. <br />The worst performance of this film goes to Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal. His Hannibal is over the top and not as quietly cunning as Brian Cox's. Sure I agree Hopkins was great in &quot;Silence&quot; but the thrill of the character is gone. We know what he's capable of and it's no longer scary or shocking. Especially after seeing the horrible &quot;Hannibal.&quot;<br />Harvey Keitel and Emily Watson also give the worst performances of their careers. Their line readings are dead in the water. Especially Keitel. He looks like he's about to fall asleep in every scene. Emily Watson isn't even half as stunning as Joan Allen. Watching Allen in &quot;Manhunter&quot; in the scene with the tiger is so spellbinding and beautiful that when you see Watson in the same scene in &quot;Red Dragon&quot; it just seems so forced and out of place.<br />I guess the main problem with this movie is the choice of director Brett Ratner.  Whereas Michael Mann is a great auteur, who faithfully adapted the book to his vision, Ratner is just a hired gun. Studios use him to make moneywhen the quality directors are all busy developing their own projects. The only reason this film was made was so the producers could cash in one last time on Hopkin's famous Hannibal character. I guess that's why Ratner was a good choice. His film is a safe, boring, carbon copy of Jonathan Demme's &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; That's just what the producers wanted and he succeeded.<br />So if you want to see the definitive adaptation of &quot;Red Dragon&quot; to the screen, see &quot;Manhunter.&quot; It's richer in story, deeper in atmosphere, and more developed in character.
B000083E79|5.0|The best of Cher over her many years.  I have all her CDs, but find this one particularly appealing in that it offers a sample of her from  beginning to &quot;end&quot; (truly...we all know there is no end for Cher).  If you are a true Cher fan...buy it now!
B00005JL96|5.0|Lord, this is the funniest Disney movie in years.  And one of the most inventive.  A problem in most Disney movies in recent years (well, actually, always) has been taking plots from other sources.  None of the Disney animated films have been in any sense original.  Contrast this with Japan's great animator Hayao Miyazaki, whose movies are almost always based upon original sources.  I don't think it is an accident that the best Disney movie in a long time is based on a completely original story.<br />Speaking of Miyazaki, Daveigh Chase, who provides the voice for Lilo, also did the voice for Chihiro in the English language dubbing for SPIRITED AWAY.  Unbelievably, she dubbed the voice for major characters in the two best-animated films of the year.  I have to be honest here:  I was really scared that LILO AND STITCH was going to win the.  It didn't.  It is very, very good, but SPIRITED AWAY is not merely the best-animated film in the past couple of decades, but quite possibly the best ever.  I knew that if the voters only watched both LILO AND STITCH and SPIRITED AWAY, then the latter would easily win the Oscar.  Luckily, enough did, and it won a well-deserved Oscar.  But LILO AND STITCH was a very strong second, and in many years would have won.<br />The film is the story of the accidentally pairing of two misfits.  Lilo is a Hawaiian girl who is being raised by her sister Nani, and Stitch is a genetic creation of an \\"evil genius\\" mad doctor, a powerful warrior creature.  Lilo has lost her family, and Stitch, or \\"Experiment 626,\\" as he is otherwise known, has never had one.  The movie essentially tells the story of how each helps the other find what she and he both need most.<br />Hopefully, this is the beginning of a new practice:  instead of creating an endless number of variations of old, traditional, and familiar stories, Disney will turn their resources to original, new, and inventive stories.
B00008DDXC|3.0|Buy the DVD for the film if you loved it, but don't expect much from the much advertised &quot;19 Additional Scenes&quot;.  These are little more than unfinished scraps from the cutting room floor, with at most only one or two of interest amongst them, which is a pity, since a DVD is supposed to be so much more than the original film.  An example of a DVD well done is Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Extended Version), which incorporates the additional 30 minutes of footage into the film --a crucial 30 minutes which fleshes out the overall story and provides crucial detail to the plot. FOTR also includes a nice voiceover commentary by the actors and filmmakers which is like sitting in a cinema with them all whispering behind the scenes secrets in your ear. Now, THAT is an enhanced movie experience.<br />Unfortunately, the CoS DVD lacks that type of added value, and what there is on the bonus disc (a few snapshots of Branagh as Lockhart; a little tour of Dumbledore's office; a preview of the video game -- can anyone say, Overt Advert?) isn't much to hold your interest.  And the interview with Rowling and screenwriter Kloves is nice, but not any more informative than anything else that may already have been covered in the press about the film or the books.  A voiceover commentary by the cast and crew would have been marvelous, but the only clips you see of cast members' comments is brief and superficial.<br />Still, I would recommend to buy it for the film, which is worth the purchase.  As for the bonus disc... at least you can enjoy a lovely Harris-as-Dumbledore illustration on the top side.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that has a great story line. The movie is a little expensive but is worth twice as much as the price. The sound on this movie is a little wierd(that may be becouse i was watching it on a ps2) but you learn to deal with it. If i explaned the story line i would probably word it wrong then no one would buy this exelent movie, so i think i will leave that to someone else. The point is this is a wonderful movie and you HAVE to buy it. If you dont you will be missing out on ...... well you will just have to watch the movie and find out.
B00008URYM|5.0|this song is the first single from her new album american life.it has a very different style.it mixes country,rnb,hiphop and electronic music.this is definately better than any music album track.the chorus is very catchy.and the rap is very fun to sing along.i recommend you to get this single.or for american life remixes you can get the maxi which features remixes by missy eliot,felix da house cat and peter raufher.this single's b-side is an unreleased remix of die another day.<br />GET THIS SINGLE RIGHT NOW.YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!

B000066AXE|5.0|I received this DVD as a Christmas Present, and I cannot even BEGIN to recall how many times I have watched it! Put simply, it is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen. The only complaint that I have is that Russell Crowe was not awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. He is a brilliant, beautiful actor, and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; would have never won Best Picture without him!
B00005JLRT|5.0|This movie was awesome ... this movie is a must see for Star Trek fans, and any other science fiction lover! Great job of bringing the Generations crew to rest, but hoping to see them in another movie, maybe with Voyager
B00003CWL6|4.0|CAST: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney, Scott Bakula, and Sam Robards.<br />DIRECTED BY: Sam Mendes<br />MPAA RATING: R for strong sexuality, language, violence, and drug use.<br />Winning several Academy Awards, including best picture, this film showcases a great cast along with outstanding filmmakers. Director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball, while both new to the screen, make it seem like they've been doing this for years. Titled a black comedy, American Beauty focuses on a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis in the middle of his boring life and tries to reinvent himself, so to speak, by setting his eyes on his daughter's best friend. Kevin Spacey, who plays Lester Burnham, is showcased in one of his best roles I have seen him in. Annette Bening, who plays his wife, Carolyn in the film, is also good, but not nearly as good as Spacey's character, who takes the stage throughout the film. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, a character who takes pleasure in Spacey's daughter in the film often by videotaping her. Thora Birch plays Jane, Spacey's daughter in the film with somewhat of a strong performance, as well as Mena Suvari who plays Angela, the girl that Lester lusts over in the film. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Frank Fitts, an ex-marine father who is rigid and harsh throughout. The film flows in a manner that keeps you interested, even though you know right from the beginning how it's going to end. Still, a great film that contains great performances, both on screen and off.
038572179X|1.0|I just finished reading this book and if I didn't have to read it for my book club, I never would have read to the end.  Very boring, tedious and too much detail.  I literally skipped 30-40 pages when Robbie was fighting in the war.  I never felt like I got to know the characters.  We know Briony commits a terrible crime and it's supposed to change her life.  But the author doesn't show us how her life was changed. He jumps from when she's 18 to the age of 77 and we don't know how she lived her life in between.  I was a bit angry as I read the story because I felt I was wasting my time.  To me, the story was pointless and when I finished, I wondered, who cares?
0060920084|5.0|Under the guise of a travel book,  The Lost Continent shows Americans' extraordinary pursuit of ignorance, false innocence, and the dumbing down that occurs when a society is caught in the thralls of rabid consumerism. In a cantankerous tone that would make Mencken proud, Bryson writes about his tongue-in-cheek quest for the mythical town of American innocence, \\"Amalgam,\\" which he of course never finds. What he does find is a young, vast country full of bovine anti-intellectuals sedated by their own dream of innocence and sated by the bounty that comes so easily to them. Please bear in mind, though, that for the most part Bryson has a gentle touch and doesn't go overboard so that his jibes maintain a friendly manner. Here is a travel book that is done in the spirit of good fun and shouldn't be taken as an insult to small-town America.
B00005JLEU|5.0|amazing movie i have seen in a long time.  i only went to watch it after reading awsome review from critics and watching it win the oscar for best animated feature.  never did i expect to be totally enchanted by this wonderful film.  the animation is simply beautiful, the story is heartbreaking and touching, the characters are ones you will never forget.  my ten year old sister would not stop talking about it and even I could not help but think about it.  as a word of caution, there are some gross and really creepy moments that will scare little children and the entire movie lasts well over two hours.  but don't think for even a second that this is a children's movie.  the complexity and rich detail makes this a masterpiece of artwork.  this movie, with its adorable and moving nature, is destined to become a modern american classic even though it is japanese anime.  i just wish that more people would go see it and experience this magical treat for themselves.  this really was worth my time.
B000002MP2|5.0|First impresion:  PURE KICK A$$ GENIUS!  I love this album, and to give anything less than 5-stars would be wrong!  This is a must have for any rock fan!  Even if you don't like GREEN DAY, you will love this album!  My faviorates are:  &quot;F.O.D.,&quot;&quot;Basket Case'&quot; and &quot;Long View.&quot;  If your friend has this, borrow it and you will understand what I'm saying.  If this CD is not in your collection, your not a true rock fan!  This was the first GREEN DAY CD I got, and I haven't stopped listening to it &quot;of and on&quot; since I got it in 1994.  It's that good, don't wait, scroll to the top, place this in your shopping cart, and get it!
B00005MAM2|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I *adore* this DVD. The special features are fantastic, including things like a glossary for the vocabulary-challanged, like myself, and an interview with the guy who did the soundtrack (blanking on his name) which gives one a new appreciation for the music of Akira. Like we needed any more proof that it was a masterpiece. I probably would've given this a three, however, if it were just the movie. I saw the movie once about a year ago, and forgot most of it because I didn't understand what was going on half the time. (Although watching it in the middle of the night probably didn't help.) Then a friend handed me the manga (all six of them!) and I devoured them in three days. After that, I watched the movie again, but was somewhat disappointed, as the plotlines are subtly different between the two. But don't let me disuade you! The incredible animation and enthralling music *alone* are worth the buy. Add in the special features, and what is still a pretty damned good anime, dispite the flaws, and I don't think you could get a whole lot better.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Aaron: What a waste of talent....and time.

B00007G1ZC|2.0|This DVD is a series of vignettes.<BR>Most often, the vignettes have the protaganist coming into contact with some natural or supernatural force or person.  <BR>There are a number of visually striking scenes, but often they are sandwiched between bombastic lectures on the dangers of technology and nuclear power.  The scene of the 6 nuclear power plants all exploding at once was particularly funny.  Frightened people running around in front of a flaming Mount Fuji backdrop that is so two dimensional and fake that it looked like something from a High-School film project.  I expected to see a guy in a Mothra or Godzilla suit jump out of the flaming crater.  <BR>The \\"blizzard\\" sequence was similarly distracting in that the snow and terrain are so fake looking that it was hard to feel very worried about the poor mountaineers.  <BR>Many of the sets and effects were very reminiscent of the old Star Treck sets.  <BR>The dialogue and story lines have no subtlety at all.  You simply get the impression that the director is taking advantage of the captive audience to introduce you to his world view.  I'm all for movies with a deep message (and I share most of the views espoused in this movie), but there is no subtlety at all in this movie's presentation of it's agenda.  <BR>If you want to see a truly beautiful and engaging Japanese movie with a similar theme, watch Princess Mononoke.  Dreams is simply a waste of time.  It's a lecture on Kurosawa's pet philosophies, masquerading as a movie.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|Well, say this for Godsmack, they are going to have one heck of a greatest hits cd.  The problem with that is that we have to wait for them to put out enough albums with enough good songs on it to make one.  There are always one or two great songs on Godsmack albums.  One this one it's &quot;Straight out of Line&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot;  and it takes forever to get from one to the other (seeing that their song #1 and #12 respectively).  The only redeemer in the middle is one you've heard before, but it does kick a** &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;  You expect a band to put on soundtrack stuff but it's usually at the end as a throwin because the other, newer stuff rocks more, not here.  You could see they had to put it there to keep people interested.  Don't get me wrong, I like Godsmack, they rock live, but the albums have too many songs that sound identical and you are reaching for the eject button quicker with each play.  Still though, I can't wait for their greatest hits.  Song for Song that will rock.
630472229X|2.0|Okay, look. My brother and I have a personal grudge against this disapointment. First off, how in the heck did an alien get on board the SULACO ? <br />Sigourney Weaver (aka Baldy in this one) didn't care to even preserve the characters who survived, so killing Hicks and Newt- poor Newt, so she can cash in on her pay. <br />And the effects were not good. I could tell the alien effects were not generated well. Again, shame !!!
0765342294|5.0|I had to read this book in my 9th grade class.  This is the first school book I have ever enjoyed.  It can get kind of intense at some points, so I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids, but it is an amazing read for older individuals.  It is incredibly written, and you really get into the book. I wound up finishing the book in three days,  I couldn't put it down.  I recommend it very highly.
B00005Y228|4.0|MOST OF THE SONGS HAVE THE SAME CLUB BEAT AND DANCEFLOOR AND A COUPLE OF THE OTHERS ARE WORTH BUYING THE ALBUM FOR GREAT DANCE MUSIC AT PARTIES AND DJ'S ...FOR WEDDINGS.  GOOD JOB KYLIE
B00000HYXB|3.0|I was very excited to get this album. The idea of basing an album on one of Tolkiens masterpieces by a well respected metal band was all I needed to hear.<br />And while the concept is executed to near perfection, I felt let down.....a little. There is a definate contradiction in my feelings about this album. There's plenty of good music, but a lot of it seems too similar to me. And worse, what variation there is seems to be conformed to the standard sound by Kursch's vocals which simply ruin some of the songs. Perhaps he is an acquired taste (?)<br />I can see what people like about this band though, but a little more variety or trying something different once in a while could have made this album a masterpiece instead of simply good.<br />Nighfall in Middle Earth fails to wow me, despite it's excellent concept, lyrics and a few really good songs.<br />But all that being said, it was good enough that I will pick up another Blind Guardian CD and is worth owning, just don't expect it to be the next best album you buy.

B0000028UK|5.0|You don't have to remember the early 90s to know what happened musically during it; \\"grunge\\" did, and that's almost all that needs to be said. Pearl Jam released the best-selling album of the label (the \\"grunge\\" label, that is) with Ten, and were even called the \\"spokesmen of Generation X\\". So... what led to their social downfall? Why is it that so few people listen to them today, as compared with yesterday? It doesn't completely have to do with the quality of their music (which has stayed on the same level, in a lot of Pearl Jam fans' opinions); what they stand for politically is also too different and too publicized for the people of most countries. And it seems like the band wouldn't have that any other way.<br />1. Go - It's a rocker, much like Once, off of Ten. Is it a great one? You bet. About begging to not be alone... ironic, as far as Pearl Jam's one-time followers go.<br />2. Animal - Another rocker. \\"I'd rather be with an animal\\" is the big lyric line. It's pretty good. What more can be said?<br />3. Daughter - Much like Why Go as far as the subject matter goes, Daughter has to do with the abuse of young females... except this one's soft, slow, and doesn't pick up until much near the end. Needless to say, it's a quality work, as are all the other tracks on the record.<br />4. Glorified G - A somewhat louder track against gun use, though not as raging as Go... a lot of Pearl Jam fans list it as one of their least favorites, though radio audiences embrace(d) it.<br />5. Dissident - You've most likely heard this one on the radio... soft, a bit depressing... about betrayal. But those guitars... especially at the beginning...<br />6. W.M.A. - Imagine this: you loved Ten... and you're a white male. Then you hear this! \\"Took his mother's white ... to his tongue/dirties his hands, well, it comes right off\\"... a song seemingly against racial profiling. Dave's (not Krusen, by the way) drumming is key.<br />7. Blood - Unfortunately, Seattle is often known for heroin... and here's a song that's most likely about it. Another big rocker... the type that the band's known for.<br />8. Rearviewmirror - Actually was embraced by radio... some consider it a sequel to Daughter. Possibly figurative... or maybe not. Not too loud... and slow at times, while faster at others. A common favorite amongst fans.<br />9. Rats - Well, here's another bit of liberalism; it's most likely a shot at Republicans. Take what they're often called by their opposition, and put it in a song... and you'll have this. Eddie's harsh and almost sickly sounding vocals are huge.<br />10. Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town - Yet another big radio hit. Very soft, slow... maybe somewhat depressing, but still, somehow... pleasant.<br />11. Leash - About being controlled too much, and not being able to tolerate it... or, in a more extreme way, telling them to to... shove it (i don't want to be censored). You guessed it... it's a rocker.<br />12. Indifference - Back to slow and soft... about knowing one's way, and being frustrated that others won't follow. Is it self-righteous? ... Or, perhaps, is it out of caring too much? Your call.<br />Daughter, Glorified G, W.M.A., Rats... and also possibly Rearviewmirror, Leash, and Indifference. Highly liberal, straight from the hearts of the band. Overall, Ten has sold 11 million copies or so U.S... Vs. 7 million... the next album, Vitalogy, 5... and then the following release, No Code, with just 1. Vs. did not completely remove Pearl Jam from popularity, but it was their first step... one that they were most likely were aware of, and chose to take. Did they lose the gamble? ... To them, no. And their opinions are the ones that matter, when it comes to their music.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is an astounding disc. In my opinion, it's the peak of the Beatles' music. If you enjoyed &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;Sargent Peppers' ...&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;, you should listen to what this album has to offer.
B00008DDXB|5.0|Excellent for all ages! Lots of good old imagianry fun!
B0000640VO|5.0|I seriously love this movie! I think it's great for most people unless you're just a mean cranky old man!
B00000I8UE|5.0|Doing a Miles Davis tribute is a daunting enough challenge - how do you conjure up his spirit and enormous stylistic diversity across a multi-decade career - i.e. which Miles?  The 1950s Miles of \\"Woody and You?\\"  The 1960s Miles of the classic quintet?  The 1970s Miles of \\"On the Corner?\\"  The 1980s Miles who did REM covers?<br />Wilson has come up with an interesting approach that works - cover some of the covers that Miles did (\\"Someday My Prince Will Come,\\" \\"Time After Time\\";  - do some Miles-inspired originals; and try adding lyrics to enough of the rest of his catalog so that you can cull the best for disk (\\"Sea and Sky/Blue and Green,\\" \\"Miles Chases the Voodoo Down.\\"   (OK, the last is a guess, but the mind reels at the thought of all the possible experiments that ended up on the cutting room floor -- Brandon Ross recruits his old running buddy Vernon Reid for a scat version of \\"Agartha\\"...you get my drift).<br />At the same time Wilson takes a page from Davis' career and uses diverse sonic settings keep the disk it from getting bogged down - and while the core of the sound is Lonnie Plaxico's acoustic bass, at various times marimbas, harmonicas, dobros, and Regina Carter's violin make appearances. (Just what you would expect on a Miles tribute album, right?)  The folk instruments give the album an undeniable texture, but the anchor of Wilson and Plaxico's deep jazz roots prevents it from becoming precious or fey.<br />The piece de resistance is \\"Miles Chases the Voodoo Down\\" off of the path-breaking 1970 album \\"Bitches Brew\\" which both starts the album and is reprised at the end as an energetic duet with the wonderful Beninois singer Anjelique Kidjo.  Lyrically Wilson locates it in that spot where the Mississippi and Niger Rivers intersect in East St. Louis.  Dave Holland, the Funkiest British Bass Player Ever, is brought back to lay down the classic bass line. Too bad Bennie Maupin wasn't available for a bass clarinet solo. Great disk.
B0000027RL|5.0|You've heard \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Black\\", and \\"Jeremy\\" (as well as \\"Daughter\\", \\"Betterman\\" and \\"Last Kiss\\"). You've heard about their role as one of the biggest and best Seattle bands (seems that CDNOW forgot Alice in Chains... critical error, though still a pretty good review overall by them). You may've even seen their SNL performances. But have you heard the album as a whole? If not... it's still around and selling well, for just $10 or less a copy. Like the singles, but still not sure if it's worth the cash? I'll tell you all I know, my friend.<br />THE FIRST HALF - Mature, angrier 80s (hair?)metal.<br />1) Once - Eddie's furocious growl kicks things off superbly... loud, short, and in-your-face. A true \\"grunge\\" song.<br />2) Even Flow - You've probably already heard it... and hopefully enjoy it.<br />3) Alive - See Even Flow description.<br />4) Why Go - Somewhat like \\"Once\\", except about the abuse of a female child... a little bit slower, too. Eddie's growl's all over it.<br />5) Black - See Even Flow description.<br />6) Jeremy - See Even Flow description.<br />THE SECOND HALF - Slower, and more like the future of Pearl Jam.<br />7) Oceans - Slow... no growl... and if you're expecting something \\"grunge\\"y, forget it. The lyrics are quite figurative... as for what they mean, it depends on the individual.<br />8) Porch - Fast, somewhat angry (though not with that \\"grunge\\" crunch some might look for with this album), personal, and just simply filled with energy. A great way of following-up Oceans.<br />9) Garden - My personal favorite off the record... mellow, but not quite as much as Oceans. \\"I will walk/with my hands bound/I will walk/With my face, blood/I will walk/With my shadow flag/Into your garden/Garden of stone\\"... if you like those lyrics, you'll love this song.<br />10) Deep. Incredible drumming by Dave Krusen (the only Pearl Jam album he's involved in... but with the ones who followed him, it's not so much a loss, as good as he was), mixed with thatgrowl already mentioned and some daring and aggressive words that seem to describe sexual abuse. ... Wow.<br />11) Release. Suffering? ... Beaten, or recovering? ... Awaiting a new day, or the end? It's hard to figure it out... who are/were Pearl Jam waiting up in the dark for? The questions of figurativism. Long, soft, and ends with... well, it's best to experience it for oneself.<br />In conclusion: The first half is great, but if only it works for you, check out this album and Vs., and don't bother afterwards. If you enjoy the second half but are not so fond of the first... check out No Code and Binaural. If you enjoy both... Vitalogy, Yield, and Riot Act probably make up the right way for you to go. And if you're like me... study each album, read what people have said about them, and make your own decision. But give the band a chance... who knows? They just might change your life.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|With Lee Roths ear-wrenching screams and Eddie Van Halens' incredible guitar solos any rock fan would love this! This album features awesome songs including the amazing instumental &quot;Eruption&quot; and Roths great lyrics in &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; all these songs are gaurented to satisfy!
B00008H2LB|4.0|I first got into Linkin Park before they became a constant figure on MTV so I've been waiting for a follow up from these guys for a while now. Hybrid Theory was a great album that was still part of the rap/rock combination but Linkin Park was still unique for having two singers, one that could do a better job of singing while hte other one doing a better job at rapping. They were also able to mix in some sounds of electronic music on the album. Meteora continues with that tradition but the album still sounds a lot like Hybrid Theory. There is some mixture with drum and bass and there are some good songs like somewhere i belong. However, the similarities to their debut album are too many to ignore making me wonder how much of an effort they but into this album.
B00008H2LE|4.0|To start off I was very unsure whether to get the album or not. Thankfully I did. The first song:<BR>1. Foreword - 2/5 It's pure turntables, but it really get's to you after a while.<BR>2. Don't Stay - 3/5 It's a good song at first until you realize how many times he says \\"sometimes.\\"<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong - 4/5 Although at first you think, \\"Is this all LP has?\\" you will realize that the song is good.<BR>4. Lying From You - 2/5 I have to say I don't like this song, it sounds a little too much like an opera.<BR>5. Hit the Floor - 2/5 Another song that just doesn't have a good beat, but the lyrics are acceptable...<BR>6. Easier to Run - 4/5 Really good song and very powerful riffs. Totally awesome.<BR>7. Faint - 5/5 This is one of the best songs I have heard yet. Unlike the other songs this one doesn't get annoying.<BR>8. Figure.09 - 3/5 It's an ok song. Nothing special, needs a little work.<BR>9. Breaking the Habit - 5/5 This is one of the best songs in the album as well. This song makes the album<BR>10. From the Inside - 2/5 A little slow and boring.<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - 4/5 I don't like rap, but damn this song is really awesome. They brag a little too much about themselves though...<BR>12. Session - 3/5 Another turntable song, but this one is a little better than \\"Foreword\\" it's more relaxing<BR>13. Numb - 5/5 Another song that makes the album. Extremely catchy and awesome all around.<BR>Overall I would recommend this album. I downloaded the songs first, but then I just knew I had to buy the album. It's not a Hybrid Theory 2 or anything, but that's the good part. Go download some songs and if you like it get the album, support the artist!!!
B00006IU73|5.0|I had to listen to this CD at least 10 times before writing this review, and the constant that is there is that it is AWESOME.  I am a huge fan of prog rock, as well as what is out there in the modern world, and I must admit these guys have fused together the best bits of prog with the other elements  of today's music.<br />I think that there are several bands that should be taking after these vets of prog/punk, and that the US airwaves need to give them a chance.<br />I cannot get this CD out of my player, as I find a new aspect of their music with each play - now how many bands are like that today???  Not many....<br />Give the PT a try, as they are well within the scope of rock, without being some sort of band that your kids play to bug you to death!!!
B00008G9JN|1.0|This, in its original form, is probably the best Tull since &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, but that's not saying much: Ian Anderson never fully recovered his artistic self-confidence (it seems) after his critics maliciously savaged that brilliant record (and to a greater extent the &quot;Passion Play&quot; concert tour, which actually did deserve unfavorable criticism). Its follow-up included the cynically conceived vapid hit single &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;, precursor of &quot;Songs from the Woods&quot;'s &quot;The Whistler&quot;. The remaining music and lyrics here, not counting the &quot;bonus tracks&quot;, are pleasant but un-inspired. <br />If you already own Tulls from &quot;This Was&quot; to &quot;A Passion Play&quot; and desire more, buy &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;--but not THIS version: You do not need two renditions of &quot;Velvet Green&quot; on the same record, and the &quot;remastered&quot; recording quality is distinctly inferior to the original.
B000002J1F|4.0|When I originally reviewed Yes' FRAGILE over two years ago, I gave it a three-star review.  I had felt the album lived up to its title - it was &quot;fragile.&quot;  The five short instrumental segues (with the exception of two) were plodding and seemed unneccesary.  It weighed the album down, in my original opinion.  But times change, and I finally re-discovered FRAGILE, finding out it's a great album more than I had originally perceived it to be.  It's not a perfect album, but it's still an enjoyable one nonetheless.<br />Here are the tracks in a nutshell.  &quot;Roundabout&quot; is still an undeniable classic, opening with that incredible acoustic intro and never letting up for its remaining 8 minutes.  I used to hate &quot;Long Distance Runaround,&quot; but I love it now.  It's a quick, catchy song with a guitar riff that you'll never forget.  &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot; is another 8-minute piece that expertly balances hard rock with moody, atmospheric pianos and those trademark Yes harmonies.  &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; is the album's 10-minute closer and its choatic intro (with Chris Squire's rapid basslines leading the way) hooks you from the start.<br />Now, onto the five instrumentals.  Although I still find Jon Anderson's vocal solo &quot;We Have Heaven&quot; to be annoying and Bill Bruford's way-too-short drum piece &quot;Five Per Cent for Nothing&quot; to be pointless, the other three are very good and don't detract from the album's quality like the other two.  Rick Wakeman's &quot;Cans and Brahms&quot; is a lovely classical piece with cool technical keyboard parts.  Chris Squire's &quot;The Fish&quot; is a rocking bass solo full of energy.  However, it's Steve Howe's acoustic number &quot;Mood for a Day&quot; that remains the highlight.  An awesome, Latin-inspired piece that is absolutely beautiful and would put a smile on anyone's face, including myself.  For those of you who are feeling blue, download this song and it'll make you feel right as rain again :).<br />So, those are my re-evaluated two cents.  FRAGILE isn't quite as great as CLOSE TO THE EDGE or 90125, but it's still very good and I appreciate more now than I did before.
B000001AFY|4.0|Fortunately, I bought my copy in its glorious VINYL form.<br />Two of Miss Ross's staples are here: \\"The Theme from Mahogany\\" and \\"Love Hangover\\". The former is one of her best ballads while the latter is one of the seminal dance tracks of the disco '70's.<br />Overall, not among the diva's best, but it's still an essential of her discography.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; about three months after it was released and knew after listening to &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; that she was going to win a Grammy.  Though I liked &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; very, very much, I was entranced by &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; and &quot;Painter's Song&quot;.  And &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; lifts my spirits out of the deepest rift.  I can't wait until I hear more by Ms. Norah Jones, and I am so happy that she is coming to the Dirty South this summer.  Though it's probably not the first time, I just get so caught up with college I can't pay attention to everything at once.  Anyway...Congrats on your Grammy's Norah and we're ready and waiting for more! :-)
B00008G9JM|1.0|FIVE STARS FOR THE ORIGINAL; ONE STAR FOR THIS VERSION: a) &quot;The Hare Who Lost his Spectacles&quot; is the WORST part of &quot;A Passion Play&quot;; we don't to suffer it visually augmented. b) The &quot;remastering&quot; is changing for the sake of changing, not improving. Buy the original if you don't have it. If you do have it, hang on to it.<br />Whereas, for example, the Beatles recorded thirteen studio albums (one a long double album) as well as two full CD's of sides not included on these thirteen studio albums with the same line-up (personnel, that is), each of Jethro Tull's first five albums had a different line-up. On `Stand Up&quot; electric guitarist Martin Barre replaced &quot;This Was&quot;'s Mick Abrahams. On &quot;Benefit&quot; keyboardist John Evan(s) was added. On &quot;Aqualung&quot; bassist Jeffrey Hammond(-Hammond) replaced Glenn Cornick. On &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; drummer Barrie(more)Barlow replaced Clive Bunker.<br />Every group has a different dynamic, and whereas a stable line-up worked for the Beatles (not forever, of course), a changing line-up worked for Jethro Tull. Jethro Tull only began to falter, in fact, after its line-up stabilized (for a time). &quot;A Passion Play&quot; is the first Jethro Tull record to use the same line-up as a prior record, and, probably not fortuitously, the first Jethro Tull record not to be universally praised by professional critics. (This was back in the day when critics bothered to review Jethro Tull releases.) <br />I, myself, do like &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, the original version, that is, and very much so, but there are things about it I don't like, especially &quot;The Hare Who Lost his Spectacles&quot;. Although I am willing to overlook these things, I point out their existence here because I think them symptomatic of Jethro Tull's subsequent artistic withering. Note also: The &quot;Passion Play&quot; tour was reviewed particularly harshly by professional critics, and I do think THAT unfavorable criticism justified: The film was a particularly bad idea (we came to watch a band, not videos), but beyond that, the band just seemed weary; tired and tedious. Martin Barre's unaccompanied guitar solo, in particular, was distinctly inferior to that of the year before.<br />Although Jethro Tull went on to record two more (and two dismal) albums with this line-up, if it had continued in the way it was going, the next change would have involved its flautist/acoustic guitar player. In other words, I think Ian Anderson should have disbanded Jethro Tull after &quot;A Passion Play&quot; and embarked on a solo career. Too bad he didn't.
0385503954|3.0|Ian McEwan delivers an interesting look at English life in the 30's.  The story begins at the home of a well to do family. A series of events occur that will change the lives of all those involved in unbelievable ways.  It is not so much the events , but they way they are viewed and linked together through the eyes and mind of a very young and naive girl and how she handles the situation.<br />This novel is also a powerful look at life during WWII for the soldiers and the nurses. The hardships and the medical capabilities that were available are excruciatingly clear.<br /> Ian McEwan has created a vivid  novel that tells a story that is both revealing and deceiving that pulls you rapidly along to the conclusion.
B00008J4P5|4.0|With the followup to White Blood Cells, what's next, Red Blood Cells or Platelets?  Actually, it's Elephant, with features a kind of refined sound in some spots.  They maintain their basic stripped down sound, even putting a disclaimer on the liner notes that no computers were used.<br />With \\"Seven Nation Army\\", there's evidence that the Stripes have refined their sound somewhat, with a piercing classical rock guitar reminiscent of 70's American bands.<br />The power riffs in \\"Black Math\\" sounds like \\"Detroit Rock City\\", with a distorted Nirvana-like guitar in the middle.  This guy isn't enjoying math, as he caustically asks the teacher, \\"Maybe I'll put my love on ice/And teach myself, wouldn't that be nice.\\"<br />\\"There's No Home For You Here Girl\\" is a variation on \\"Dead Leaves\\" from White Blood Cells.  Still doing that style, eh?  Another communication/alienation impasse song.  It's impossible to get along with the girl.  \\"But there's a cue and a question on your face/Fortunately I have come across an answer/Which is go away and do not leave a trace.\\"<br />Next up is Jack's cover of the Dusty Springfield classic \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself.\\"  Not bad, but I'm too used to the original.  That snarling Stripes guitar with its chords that comes when he sings, \\"Like a summer rose needs a sun and rain\\" doesn't ruin it.<br />The mellow, light bluesy ballad \\"In The Cold Cold Night\\" is sung by Meg, whose soft understated voice is accompanied by a guitar.  She could easily do solo albums--I'd buy them.<br />\\"I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart\\" underlines the frantic attempts of the boy to do the title track.  A lazy bluesy-rock guitar solo comes in the middle.  However, being rich and good looking is something the girl's mother values, since \\"someone ripped out my page in your telephone book.\\"<br />The soft acoustic ballad of the possessive \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\" details the thought processes of a guy who's finally got a girl and is desperate to keep her before she leaves.<br />\\"Ball And Biscuit\\", a euphemism for you-know-what is a bluesy rock number about a man strutting his stuff.  \\"My strength is ten fold, woman/I'll let you see it if you want to before you go.\\" is one such bravado.  The guitar solo in the middle is very searing.<br />\\"Little Acorns\\" starts with a cheesy inspirational tape based on a woman in a mental crisis inspired by a squirrel gathering acorns.  If that squirrel could survive, so could she, by dividing her problems into chunks and solving them one by one.  and the blistering crunchy song uses that theme.  The chorus goes \\"Be like the squirrel, girl/Give it a whirl, girl.\\"<br />\\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" has a slow \\"Wild Thing\\"--as in Jimi Hendrix sound.  \\"Girl You Have No Faith In Medicine\\" is a crunchy Kinks-like hard-rocker.  Rhyming medicine with acetominophen--cute!  Jack tells the girl if she's allergic to pills to get her acetominophen straight from the bark of the tree.<br />\\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\" is an amusing acoustic folky/50's rock tidbit thrown at the end, with Jack, Meg, and a guest vocalist, the helium-voiced Holly Golightly trading off lines.

The guitar solo in the middle is very searing.<br />\\"Little Acorns\\" starts with a cheesy inspirational tape based on a woman in a mental crisis inspired by a squirrel gathering acorns.  If that squirrel could survive, so could she, by dividing her problems into chunks and solving them one by one.  and the blistering crunchy song uses that theme.  The chorus goes \\"Be like the squirrel, girl/Give it a whirl, girl.\\"<br />\\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" has a slow \\"Wild Thing\\"--as in Jimi Hendrix sound.  \\"Girl You Have No Faith In Medicine\\" is a crunchy Kinks-like hard-rocker.  Rhyming medicine with acetominophen--cute!  Jack tells the girl if she's allergic to pills to get her acetominophen straight from the bark of the tree.<br />\\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\" is an amusing acoustic folky/50's rock tidbit thrown at the end, with Jack, Meg, and a guest vocalist, the helium-voiced Holly Golightly trading off lines.

B00006DEFA|5.0|personally, I think F. Murray Abraham's performance is the greatest performance I have ever seen in a movie. The movie in it's self is an amazing movie, one of my favorites, but his haunting performance will remain with you for days. This is film-making at its finest.
0060523794|1.0|The book is a good example of CEO greed in America. You will discover how Lou legally stole hundreds of millions from IBM at the expense of the poor IBM employee at the bottom working his/her [tail] off.
0446525537|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book considering how much I liked Sparks' A Message in a Bottle and The Notebook.  The characters in A Walk to Remember were one dimensional.  He didn't explore how his characters became the people they were.  We assumed the minister was the way he was because his wife died in childbirth; but how did that affect how he raised his child, etc.  Jamie's character is so flawed, uninteresting, and apparently soooooooooo nice that it's grating.  I got through the book because I bet myself that Jamie's character would not be well (though it would have been interesting to see how far this kind of relationship would have gone).  Definitely, not one of Sparks' best.
B000005JAB|5.0|I'm just adding my voice to the chorus of praise here, but to anyone considering this album, I say this: it's well worth your twelve bucks.  Like his Velvet cohort, Lou Reed, John Cale's solo work has been uneven, but Paris 1919 is his best, truly melding his pop and acoustic sensibilities with his orchestral prowess and fondness for polyphony.  Rarely is such musically (and lyrically) challenging work so damned beautiful.
B00000IB40|5.0|Message personnel is a truly beautiful albumn.  It captures all the hauntingly beautiful, romantic, agonising heartbreak, of those who are in love, spiralling, deeply, out of control...  It is hauntingly, beautifully sad.  The title track, Message Personnel, seems to be based on someone who is deeply in love with someone, yet cannot bring themselves to contact them.  I think it was based around a film.<BR>Berceuse, a lullabye for lovers together.  Many more tracks, one about a lovely garden, one track comes better than another, it simply blew me away.  My version is on vinyl, and I play it often.<br />Keith Dixon (50 yr old teacher, fan of Francoise Hardy for over 30 years!)
B000085RTZ|5.0|If you're already a Kamelot fan,then U know what an awesome power-metal band they are.Already proving themselves with The Fourth Legacy & Karma,they take it to the next level with a concept album that is a masterpiece of metal.Complete with orchestral vocals,killer riffs,and most noticably,Khan's vocal performance.This dude can sing!Rather than delve into the concept,I'll simpily tell what trax kick ...!Edge of Paradise,Descent of the Archangel,,the beutiful ballad Wander,The Mourning After and the killer III Ways to Epica.The cd has interludes that melt each track into the next seamlessly taking the listener into a super sonic mid evil dimension of metal bliss.The production is the best the bands ever had,and the entire band has stepped it up making Kamelot run like a well oiled machine.There is alot of atmosphere on this album and I can't reccomend it enough to fans of Stratovarius,Nightwish,older Queensryche and even Savatage.Incredible musicianship and a wonderful story line, EPICA takes it's place next to the likes of Abigail,Streets A Rock Opera,OPERATION:MINDCRIME & The Odyssey as a classic metal concept album.My favorite of 2003 thus far,it deserves a 5 star rating and your full attention.
B00008L3U1|5.0|This very funny and touching film has an amazing cast... ROBIN WILLIAMS (Mrs Doubtfire, Good Will Hunting), DIANE LANE (Unfaithful, Perfect Storm), BILL COSBY (The Cosby Show), and JENNIFER LOPEZ (Out of Sight, Maid in Manhatten).<br />The story is cool and the directing by FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA is very good. Worth checking out for the excellent performances by the all-star cast.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Once in a blue moon, a crowd pleaser comes along that soars the spirit. \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is one of those movies.<br />Directed in a delicious high-key style by Baz Luhrmann (WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO + JULIET, MOULIN ROUGE) in his madcap debut (the first in what would be called the Red Curtain Trilogy), the film tells the story of a top ballroom dancer who pairs with a plain, left-footed ugly duckling, when his maverick style earns him the disdain of his more conventionally-minded colleagues. Together, they give it their all and aim to make dreams of the National Championship title come true. <BR> <BR>To say this film is amazing would be an understatement. It is one of the most gloriously entertaining and awe-inducing films ever made. The cast is simply magnificant and Luhrmann introduces his clever, fast-paced directing and editing style here. He brilliantly uses a documentary style opening and ocassional interludes which help better understand the lovable characters. It works wonderfully!<BR> <BR>This is definitely the feel-good movie of the decade. It's hypnotic, strange, and deeply heartfelt--a deliciously entertaining crowd-pleaser. A highly recommended must!
0345440900|1.0|Someone gave me this book while I was pregnant and by the time my son was born, I tried to implement the schedule suggested by &quot;the baby whisperer&quot;, it had me in tears every day! <br />Her method was very routine and when a baby comes home, there is no routine until about 8 weeks old! <br />I have friends that have used her method and their babys had failure to thrive issues. This book made me feel like a failure because she seemed to &quot;know&quot; all the secrets and since I did not I felt so bad about myself and my confidence as a mother! She also does not encourage breastfeeding which made it even more difficult to relate to the book.<br />She also has you rate your baby, textbook baby, angel, fussy etc. and if your baby comes up fussy it makes you feel even worse! <br />I think this book is very dangerous for new Moms, it encourages parent directed feeding which is not good in the first few months and does go against the APA! Tracey also says you must have an eat, awake, sleep routine called EASY. I thought it was anything but easy!  I spent more time stressing out about this routine and did not enjoy  my baby!<br />I finally had to throw this book out! It was awful and it went against everything I felt in my heart. I love my son and I felt like this book prevented me from getting to know him instead of forcing a schedule on him at such a young age.<br />Once I got rid of the book and went with the natural rythem of my son, life was fun again and we got peace, sleep and less crying, YIPEE!
B00005JLEU|4.0|The clarity of the details, rich color palette plus intense and distinctive characters all help to create an extraordinary dream-like beauty.  The pure heart of Chihiro as she encounters tests of her perserverence is very touching.  There is a clear message against greed and in favor of hard work and kindness.  <br />For all the beauty, though, it must be said that this film is not for young children (newly rated PG in the Disney version, which I have not seen..I bought the original with subtitles)  The various demons are hauntingly odd and bizarre, especially the \\"No-face\\" one which tempts others to become greedy, then unveils a large mouth and eats them.  Yubaba the witch has a huge head and turns into a creature, still with her head, which takes to the night sky like a strange predatory bird.  There are also gross moments, when No-face vomits up all the things he ate over a period of time, and when the River God comes to the bathhouse so dirty he is dripping slime as he walks. <br />Interestingly, Hayao Miyazaki's \\"Princess Mononoke\\" also has a gross monster, the boar-like thing that has worms dripping out of it as it moves.  If Mr Miyazaki would refrain from these gross moments, I'd be more interested in seeing these unique, entrancing films over and over.  Perhaps it is a cultural thing, with the gross details of such demon creatures being necessary to be true to their cultural tales.  But it does not suit my taste, and I certainly would have children under age 14 or 15 to see it.  On the other hand, Mr Miyazaki's \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" and \\"My Neighbor, Totoro\\" are more suited to children, and also have the heart, unique details/stories and dream-like beauty, without the grossness or scariness.
0743201140|5.0|&quot;Now, Discover Your Strengths&quot; is a refreshing break from the standard Myers-Briggs evaluation of your personality.  Instead of the old Introvert-Extravert, Thinking-Perceiving, etc. framework we've all enjoyed, here we have 34 different themes to identify our strengths.  Examples are Discipline, Fairness, Analytical, Competition, Learner, Strategic, and Futuristic.  By discovering which themes resonate with your own strengths, you can determine what sort of work you should be doing.<br />As a person who enjoys reading about personality profiling, I've been through quite a bit of material.  This book may well be my favorite, even over the classic &quot;Do What You Are.&quot;<br />Your book will come with a code that allows you to take the test online, which is a nice bonus and works much better than having to mark up your copy and turn pages to figure out a score.
0151008116|5.0|When I was given this book, I actually knew very little about it.  The book jacket wasn't very helpful, mentioning only a boy, a tiger and the vast Pacific Ocean.  It almost hints at a light tale of adventure, but like the ocean, it is deeper than it seems at the surface.<br />This is the story of Pi, an Indian teenager who, while emigrating from India to Canada with his family, winds up being  the sole human survivor when the ship sinks.  The emphasis is on &quot;human&quot; as he winds up sharing his lifeboat with a tiger, orangutan, hyena and zebra, a small menagerie from the ship's holds who were to be transported to various zoos.  Nature takes its course until only the tiger is left, and Pi is forced to form an uneasy alliance with the cat.  There is little that is sentimental in this relationship and no sweet friendship; the tiger remains a dangerous carnivore and never cute or cuddly.<br />This has most of what you would want in a story: humor, suspense, adventure, and mystery.  Add to this, a healthy portion of theology and a good serving of horror and this is a complete literary meal, both tasty and with the recommended daily allowance of quality.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is beautiful. To me, it is by far my favorite movie which overshadowed even 'Lord of the rings' and 'Godfather'. There are two main reasons for that. The first reason is I am an avid student in Economics: the story of the genius and the game theory fascinate me the most - hardly find another movie in this genre. The second reason is the great performance of Russell Crowe. If anyone have seen 'Gladiator', 'the Insider' and 'LA Confidential', you will realize the real acting talent of Russell. The characters in this four movies are very different kind of personalities, but Russell can just pull them all off beautifully. I believe he is the best actor in his generation.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is phenominal.  It has the harder songs like Bring Me to Life, but it also has slower songs like My Immortal and Hello.  This CD is crazy. Her voice is so amazing.  She can hit and hold incredibly high notes.  Yet it doesnt hurt your eardrums when she does.  Then she also has the deep rich aspect to it as well.  The song lyrics are phenominal.  They write there own stuff which i respect so much.  Get this CD.  If you like the single Bring Me To Life, you will love the rest.  Its so crazy.
B000000H7I|5.0|The word \\"brutal\\" is often applied to death metal.  In fact, in virtually every DM review you read, \\"brutal\\" is an adjective that gets thrown around quite a bit.  Suffocation, unlike some of their peers, is a band that truly deserves the rank of \\"brutal.\\"  \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" is one sick release.  The level of musicianship is mindblowing.  Guitar riffs pound your ears from every direction, reeking of savage technicality.  HARSH vocals growl and grunt like some kind of demon.  The drumming is beyond phenomenal, with some unique twists on the average blastbeat.  I love the production here; the guitars and bass pack one massive low-end wallop.  While some may complain that it is not clear enough, I think the murkiness gives an added dimension to the proceedings.  Lyrics are far more intelligent and thoughtful than the average death metal band.  While they are still very violent and dark, they show a much more literate approach than Cannibal Corpse or Mortician.  All these elements come together quite nicely for what can be described as a \\"classic\\" in death metal, something that is rare in genre filled with cookie-cutter clones who offer nothing new.  If you are a fan of the harder forms of death metal, you would do well to purchase this.  And if you enjoy Suffocation, check out Immolation, Cryptopsy, and Origin for more technical DM mayhem
B00008URYM|5.0|What a great song this is. I honestly believe that this is Madonna's best song to be released as a single in 5+ years. Not since Ray of Light & Frozen has there been anything this good. And after I thought Die Another Day came pretty darn close ... <br />This single shows the Material Girl in her most raw & pure form in a long time ; maybe ever. This is maybe even one of the best ever that she has released (and I've been a BIG fan since the beginning ... early 1983 since Everybody hit the clubs)!<br />A very interesting \\"rap\\" and a bit of a controversial political theme accompany this absolutely AWESOME song. Just buy the single (or also it's now all over the radio) and give it a try. <BR>I highly doubt that you will be unhappy with it!
B000005HLV|5.0|\\"Black Metal\\" is the term used to describe this music.  With the possible exception of Darkthrone and early Burzum, I would have to say that \\"black\\" has never been better used as an adjective.  The atmosphere contained on this CD completely transcends cheesy synths or excessive corpse paint.  You will feel the harshness of a Norweigian snow storm on this disc.  Cold, grim, evil music made by truly evil people (read \\"Lords of Chaos\\" if you don't believe me). Beginning with the inhumanly fast power-chord opening of \\"Funeral Fog,\\" through the death metal plodding of \\"Freezing Moon,\\" to the haunting title track,  the listener is kept within a blizzard of chainsaw guitars, vomited vocals, and blastbeats to rival a mechanized tank assault.  Attila's utterly bizzare vocals are either eerie, dissonat howls from hell or an ungody amalgamation of opera and death-metal grunts.  Hellhammer puts on a truly amazing display of high-speed beats here, one often wonders if any human could truly drums at such a vicious tempos.  The murdered Euronymous shows why he is what every black metal guitarist wishes they were.  And, contrary to popular belief, Varg \\"Count Grishnack\\" Vikernes' bass parts were *not* taken from this album, and this fact alone is quite frightening<br />When black metal is mentioned, the violent deeds of the scene's progenitors often overshadow the music.  But rest assured,  Mayhem's \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\" delivers the icy goods with little to be desired.  If you want to see what black metal is, buy this album.  And, while you're at it, get Darkthrone's \\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\" and \\"Under a Funeral Moon.\\"  With these CD's you will experience some of the most evil and unforgiving metal to ever be pressed.  Black metal, indeed.
B0000508U6|5.0|I admitted in a previous review I bought &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; first, simply because I'd heard one of the songs before.  What I didn't realize was that, yes, I'd heard the song &quot;Yellow,&quot; but didn't know at the time who was singing the song.  (I disagree with those who complain about the lyrics.  When has yellow not been a mood color?)  My personal favorite on this CD is probably the song &quot;Trouble,&quot; maybe because it seems to connect with me on that all-omniscient scale of been there/done that.  There is something, and I mean this as a sincere compliment, but there is something quite alien in Coldplay's music.  When music can be haunting, disturbing, beautiful, and unforgettable in a four or five minute composition and leave the listener with wanting more instead of less, that is a rare achievement indeed.  I realize I'm probably not the only person to have considered this idea, but the song &quot;Spies&quot; sounds more appropos than any of the most recent James Bond music.  Someone should send a memo to the &quot;Alias&quot; folks.  (Interesting that this CD was banned in China because of the song &quot;Spies.&quot;  Sounds like somebody was just a wee bit paranoid.)
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is superb collection. Now any Beatles fan can enjoy the incredible DVD experience with the greatest rock n roll group of all time! If you've seen the VHS (eight tape set) from 1996, you'll love this even more. The 5-DVD set has the fifth disc full of never-before seen interviews and priceless footage, and the Real Love video originally omitted from the VHS release. DVD has been tested to retain perfect image quality for 100-years (compared to twenty for videotape).The sound quality is vastly superior on this format. What better sound is there than all those incredible Fab Four classics?
B000069AUI|5.0|I admit I was a little late to the Coldplay bandwagon, but I have become completely mesmerized by the music and the lyrics of this CD.  I happened to see their performance on the Grammys of their song &quot;Politik&quot; and it was one of those whoa! moments that encouarged me to check out their album.  For some reason, I have not quite been able to actually pinpoint a 'sounds like' which connects Coldplay to any other one singer or one band.  Yeah, Chris Martin has a certain (mellow) Dave Matthews sound on some of his songs and some of the arrangements do tend to remind you of the more melancholy Pink Floyd.  However, if you delve further into each song, the resulting melting pot of musical influences becomes rather like a musical Rosetta stone.  I realize not all music is to everyone's taste, but if you want to hear lyrics that either are hauntingly beautiful or strangely thought provoking, or perhaps a dazzling combination of both, this is the band you've been looking for.  My personal favorite seems to be &quot;The Scientist,&quot;  but trying to narrow down a favorite on this CD is somewhat akin to trying to determine your own favorite memory.
B000003TA4|5.0|Hey you wanna know what I think is funny? The fact that you can't see the sheer genius of this phenomenal album. If Kurt was such an idiot, why have musicians tried to copy his style of music time and time again? Why has Nirvana been featured in every VH1 Top 20 Countdown made? Why does he have millions of fans? I'll tell you, because he WAS a genius and I'm sorry that you can't see that because you're missing something great.Kurt was one of the most influential frontmans of any band as Nirvana was one of the most influential bands in rock HISTORY! They changed rock FOREVER AND KURT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!!!!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|First of all, let me say that many of Springsteen's fans have made fools of themselves in their reaction to Bruce's loss to Norah Jones at the Grammies.  If you read any online forums or Backstreets magazine, you'll see plenty of sore losers who unfairly bash Norah because she had the combination of luck and talent to win album and song of the year over Bruce.  Some of them are pretty mean-spirited and hateful, and I'm embarrased to say that I share an interest with some of these people.  Norah Jones is a young, fresh artist who deserves to be heard as much as Bruce did (but wasn't) with his first several albums.  That being said, The Rising should have won Album of the Year.  That doesn't diminish Norah Jones, but I think the fact that she doesn't write her own material while Bruce does puts him ahead of the game in competition for the best album.  Bruce's loss also doesn't diminish that this is an album worthy of every possible honor.  Time will tell how Norah will fare (and I think she'll be around a long time), but Bruce is an established classic artist and this is one of his finest moments.<br />The Rising finds Bruce Springsteen reunited with The E Street Band (it's confusing the way this is hyped, but he techincally hadn't recorded a full album with the band since Born in the USA, even though various members of the band have appeared on various recordings since then and I think its a little deceptive to present it this way).  They sound like themselves, but then again they don't.  This, I think is thanks to Brendan O'Brien, the producer that Bruce chose to work with for The Rising.  There's a new depth and texture to Bruce's sound- lots of strings and other exotic instruments that don't often find there way onto a Springsteen album.  I think O'Brien can be thanked for a lot of this, as well as for the fact that it actually didn't take years for Bruce to finish the album.  Let's hope that this leads to a long and productive relationship.<br />There's hardly athrowaway song on the album.  Standouts for me include the title song, Lonesome Day, Into the Fire, Nothing Man (an underrated gem of an album track), Further On Up the Road and Waitin' on a Sunny Day.  The only song that I think sounds rather generic is Countin' On a Miracle- it seems to fit in with the bland stuff that Bruce recorded in the early 90s (heard on Disc 4 of his Tracks box-set) and doesn't come to life any better when performed in concert.  Bruce's voice is in top form, and he's lost the appropriate but dry twang he adapted for The Ghost of Tom Joad and which painfully leaked its way into some of his live performances since then.  <br />It's pretty well known that this CD is seen as a 9/11 concept album (making it all the more surprising that it didn't win the Grammy), and Bruce himself hyped the heck out of that angle.  But I don't really see it as that.  Sure, there are obvious references to rescuers sacrificing themselves and to empty skylines, but I see this CD as being more about loss in general, and how we cope when we're left behind.  I don't know that this angle was really brought up (and well it shouldn't have been), but I believe that Bruce lost his father within the past four or five years.  That undoubtedly influenced this CD as much as did the events of 9-11.  LOSS is the concept that ties most of the songs here. While we were all impacted by the terrorist attacks- whether through loss of a loved one or employment or sense of security- the losses conveyed here are on a much more personal level than simply being specific to 9-11.  Anyone who has ever experienced the absence of a loved one (whether through death or the breakup of a relationship) can identify with the sentiments of \\"You're Missing\\" or \\"Empty Sky\\".  \\"The Fuse\\" is about two lovers, possibly strangers, drawn into intimacy through some event- maybe a funeral, maybe 9-11.  \\"Nothing Man\\" is about surviving- or maybe being in some way responsible for- some violent event, and the accompanying guilt and numbness.  Life goes on for the main character, but its not the same and maybe not worthwhile anymore (is the pearl and silver lying on his table a gun?)  There are also some mildly political songs- \\"Paradise\\", about both a suicide bomber and the loved one of a victim presumably killed by the terrorist.  \\"Worlds Apart\\" tells of two lovers from vastly different cultures- possibly an American and an Afghani and the gulf caused by these differences.  So if you're looking for a gung-ho 9-11 album that talks about national anger and reactionary patriotism, with references to airplanes and hijackers and heroic passengers, you're not going to find it.  The 9-11 angle is at best subtle and most of the time quite general.  And frankly, I think that's a good thing.<br />It's a shame that Bruce Springsteen gets so little airplay, and that he had to rely on his (overdone) media appearances to promote this fine CD.  Let's hope that this is the start of a long period of prodcutivity for Bruce and that he continues to record and to tour well into the next two or three decades.  This CD will tide us over nicely until then...
B00000J7JO|2.0|I've never been much of a Chili Peppers fan but I bought this CD because I liked Scar Tissue and the title track (even thought I think people will agree with me that &quot;californication&quot; was far overplayed on the radio).  I was hoping that the rest of the tracks would be as mainstream oriented and well-crafted as these tracks but unfortunately, they aren't quite as catchy.  The songs have most of the right elements but don't seem like much effort was put into making them sound as good as they could.  Still, Otherside, Parallel Universe, and All Around the World are high points.  In all honesty, I don't have much chili peppers experience to base my opinions on so I find it likely that fans would find much more in this album than I did.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There is no better example of a tighter, more creative, and more complete album produced in the 1990's, period. The flow of the album is incredible, and listening to it is an experience. It works well seperately - \\"Let Down,\\" \\"Karma Police,\\" \\"No Surprises,\\" and all the other songs can be great single-shot pick-ups in the middle of the day - but when placed all together in its designated order, it transcendes your usual music experience. And \\"OK Computer\\" heralded a complete redefinition of what rock 'n roll could be; rock was twisted, bent, reshaped, and emerged as a glorious and mind-blowing being in a way it never had before. \\"OK Computer\\" simply does no wrong: there is no \\"bad\\" track, no \\"stupid\\" or \\"frivilous\\" song. It is as close to musical perfection as could be attained in 1997, and has only been topped by subsequent Radiohead releases. Perfection.
B00008I8IF|4.0|I was surprised when I heard this album...the first Jayhawks CD that I ever had to listen to twice not because I liked it, but to make sure I did. Although the album has 14 tracks, it's technically 13 songs because 1 and 14 are the same. The first time I listened through, I was impressed by tracks 1 through 6, let down by 7, surprised when 8 and 9 made a fine return to pop gem form, then puzzled from 10 to 14. It's not that any of the latter half of the album is bad, but they don't really stand out like the other tracks. Here's how I break it down:<br />THE STAND-OUT MOMENTS OF POP PERFECTION<br />Stumbling through the Dark<BR>Tailspin<BR>All the Right Reasons<BR>Save It for a Rainy Day<BR>Eyes of Sarajane<BR>One Man's Problem<BR>Come to the River<BR>Angelyne<BR>Tampa to Tulsa<br />THE BAD<br />Don't Let the World Get in Your Way-normally I like Tim O'reagan's songs, but not this time<BR>Madman-I thought some of the demos on the extra disk were<BR>       better than this!<br />THE GOOD BUT NOT QUITE CLASSIC<br />You Look So Young<BR>Will I See You in Heaven<br />As you can see, more than half the album is good, so I do feel it is worth the money (and the 3 year wait since SMILE). It's worth the price alone just for &quot;Angelyne.&quot; The Jayhawks make heartache sound so pretty.<br />My advice: if you are confused like I was upon your first listen, give the disc a couple more spins. If the fog hasn't lifted by the third listen, then you probably just arent destined to like the album.<br />And oh yeah, one more thing: forget about wishing for Mark Olson's return, because he isn't coming back. No matter what lineup the Jayhawks may have in the future, two things will always be certain: there will be Gary Louris and no Mark Olson. For those of you who still whine about his absence, get over it. Louris is a fine songwriter on his own anyway.
0446310786|5.0|'To Kill a mocking bird' is a tapestry of anectodes vividly brought out by an excellent american raconteur - Harper Lee. It's a narration of the childhood days of a girl nicknamed Scout, who is too intelligent for her age with the intransigence of a child, in which her apparently dull & talentless father, Atticus Finch, reveals his heroism through his headstrong uprightness & optimism to rebel against the amoral racist prejudices of his village.   The beauty of this book is its style, which is effective in convincing the reader that the whole story is from the viewpoint of an immature young girl. Lee achieves this by intertwining the main plot, as if it were unimportant (from the girl's viewpoint), with the story of a mysterious neighbour Boo Radley, whom the trio of Scout, Jem - Scout's tutelary elder brother and Dill - their friend, set out to discover. The quiet wit that is strewn all over is another plus that makes it an unstoppable read.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Steal this Album combines alot of elements to give you 16 songs you can listen to over and over again.<br />1) CHIC N STU: (8/10) A really great song to start a really great album. A song you can play over and over again.<br />2) INNERVISION: (7/10) The album version isn't as good as the radio version, but it's still a good song. Not the best on the CD, though.<br />3) BUBBLES: (10/10) One of my favorites on the CD. Very catchy tune, and I love when Serj begins saying: \\"May I remind you?\\"<br />4) BOOM: (9/10) A very polotical song SOAD just made a music video out of. News channels use it as a background song when they are showing clips of the war with Iraq. The song itself gives facts by talking, with a very catchy chorus.<br />5) NUGUNS: (8/10) This is a good song. Between the chorus Serj sings softly and it turns SOAD-ish around the chorus. <br />6) A.D.D: (10/10) VERY catchy and dark song. The lyrics are very well written aswell. One of my favorites on the album.<br />7) MR JACK: (9/10) A creative song with Daron singing partly in it. <br />8) IEAIAEO: (10/10) This was the song that made me go out and buy the album. Very quirky and cool song. Especially when Serj goes \\"Mine Delusions Acquaintences, Bubbles Erotica etc etc\\"<br />9) 36: (6/10) Alot of loud singing. Shortest SOAD song, lasting only 46 seconds.<br />10) PICTURE: (9/10) A very catchy song. A weird, but cool chorus that you can sing along to.<br />11) HIGHWAY SONG: (10/10) Another great song. Serj experiments alot with his voice in this song.<br />12) F**K THE SYSTEM: (7/10) A goofy song which has absolutely no meaning. Fun to listen to, with a catchy chorus.<br />13) EGO BRAIN: (9/10) Great guitar work in this song; nice chorus<br />14) THETAWAVES: (10/10) A very fast-pace, catchy song. <br />15) ROULETTE: (510) I don't really like this song because the chorus is way to repetative and by the end of the song you are bored of hearing the same 3 or 4 lines. Nice music work in this song though.<br />16) STREAMLINE: (10/10) A very dramatic song used in the Scorpion King soundtrack. Amazing music work here. One of the best songs on the album.<br />Overall, Steal this Album! offers you a new type of System of a Down which you haven't really heard before in there other albums. Go out and buy this amazing CD! =D
0385504209|5.0|Great read, factual, entertaining... what more do you need?
0783229526|5.0|This cult classic is just that for several reasons.  Under the brilliant directing talent of former Pythoner Terry Gilliam one of the great counter culture books of all time unfolds with mass hysteria.  Johnny Depp steps into the twisted head of the great Hunter S. Thompson and takes us with him, consuming enough drugs to kill a horse.  Benecio Del Toro adds to this colorful cocktail by pushing Depp's character to the deepest depths of what can only be called Gonzo journalism.  This psycadelic, colorful romp through Las Vegas is hilarious, rediculous, and at times thought provoking, and is best served with everything in your medicine cabinet and a few beers.  After all, anything worth doing, is worth doing right.
B00001MXXH|5.0|This is a really fun movie which can be safely viewed by pretty much any one. By now you probably know the plot line from the other reviews.<BR>In the grand tradition of 80's movie DVD's, we are left with little special features apart from talkovers with John Hughes throughout the film (optional feature) <BR>The acting is all well represented as well as the script. Remember, it is just a teen movie so don't expect too much!!<BR>The is a great work movie - meaning you can play this whilst doing desk work, or home work etc and still able to follow the plot. <BR>Fun!!
B000006TRV|2.0|I must admitt The Wall does have some(notice the word some) good songs such as Another Brick In The Wall parts 1-3 and Comfortably numb. But there are some very dark themes and racist themes such as in &quot;Waiting for the Worms&quot; &amp; &quot;In the Flesh!&quot; which has anti-semetisim, and racist and other very derogatory remarks. This was mainly a Roger Waters album, it doesn't sound like Pink Floyd. I am a very big fan of the Floyd and I depise this album. If you want a good album go for either The Division Bell or Dark Side of the Moon.

B000089RVX|5.0|Wow! I've been looking for a band with this kind of overwhelming emotional intensity for a very long time.  Amy is a Goddess.  Her voice is truly perfect but what makes Amy so special is she takes her singing to the next level because she truly feels it, steps inside it and serves it up on a silver platter.  She doesn't sing to the masses, she sings to the individual listener.  That is the way it should be! The entire band is truly awesome and backs her like a best friend. I sense a tightly knit group with an amazing future. I've listened to this cd more times than I care to admit and it keeps getting better!  Honestly, my car speakers have been smoking, literally! I kid you not. We are talking powerful Music charged with a Force to be reckoned with here! Yeah, the speakers get hot and smoke, my ears bleed, and my heart lets go as a dissipating vapor whispers &quot;I can stop the pain if I will it all away.&quot; 'Fallen' fills me up with the strength, hope and desire to rise above any obstacle life throws my way.  Thank you &amp; Godspeed to Evanescence and Music lovers everywhere. Soar!
B00006LLNU|2.0|I really wanted to like this. I heard so many good things about this band that I was really curious to see what all the hype was about. But for the same reasons that I completely hate jazz, I hate this as well: it is completely pompus B.S. It resembles something that belongs in my grandmothers collection than mine. Complete elevator music. Boring.
B000002HH2|5.0|Until recently, I could not have named a specific Bjork song. Certainly, I had heard of Bjork, but somehow I had managed to miss her music. One night I was sitting in my room, casually watching a cable music channel here in Australia and the film clip for 'It's oh so quiet' came on. I was very intrigue with not only the inventive film clip, but with the music as well. So to become aquainted with Bjork and her music, what better way than to start than with the CD from which that song was released. Though Post is several years old now (first released in 1995), it sounds as fresh and modern as any CD released today.<br />Now to the difficult part of reviewing the music contained on Post. The music here is so diverse that there is no one label that could be attached to it. If I could use one word to describe Post it would have to be 'contrast'. I can't recall listening to a CD that was so diverse musically.<br />The first track, 'Army of me', is a heavily layered, rhythmic, booming song that certainly conjures up the impression of troops marching into war (appropriate in our present world climate). Bjork pours a lot of restrained anger into her performance here, both vocally and musically. It is from the second track where we see the theme of contrast come into play - 'Hyperballad' is a quiet track musically but the vocals have an 'on the edge of anger' feel. The contrast theme is further explored in the following track 'The modern things' where the song starts off sparsely with electronic synths and builds up layers including the addition of traditional instruments.<br />On Post, there are four main areas of contrast that are explored musically: contrasting different musically genres between tracks (the traditional jazzy feel of 'It's Oh so quiet' compared to the rest of the tracks), contrasting the volume in individual tracks (between instruments and between instruments and vocals), the use of electronic interments with traditional classical interments within the samesong and the use of traditional instruments to give a 'world music' feel to many tracks.<br />The track 'I miss you' illustrates these contrasts nicely -  we have the electronic instruments providing a mechanic, industrial sound and African type drums providing a world music feel.  The whole track comprises contrasts between the industrial and the traditional, all with subtle volume changes throughout. <br />Post has certainly provided me with a wonderful introduction to the world of Bjork. These tracks are not just cleverly crafted pop songs designed to sell bucket loads. These are well crafted, original and thought-provoking pieces of music designed not only to be enjoyed, but to also stimulate the thoughts and emotions. I will certainly be exploring further Bjork works in the future.
6305268843|1.0|...talk about the lack of morality this movie possessed.  Yes, this movie was well done and is incredibly well acted but it is pushing a message and a gross agenda.  From the very beginning when the two come together to make love for the sake of having a child, to when Dillane and Marceau again make love to satisfy their lust while Dillane's poor wife lies in her bed upstairs, to when Dillane kills his wife because he wants to be with Marceau, to when Marceau and Dillane decide that what they did was okay because they wanted to.  Disgusting.  Dillane's father (his name escapes me) talks of living life only for simple pleasures... we are meant to frown upon him and smile at Dillane for being so much more of a man for living life for deep pleasure.  What an irony.  Crazy that nobody else thinks this movie is a shame... This movie is a waste of time.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This album is so good it makes me sick.  First off, Jack White is a rock god, and the greatest rock star since Kurt. <BR>Secondly, I am flat out addicted to this masterpiece, it becomes more filthy upon every listen.  If you even have a little bit of love for rock 'n roll, you better own this album.  <BR>Elephant is without a doubt one of the greatest recordings of all time, and that's all I have to say.
B00008GKEG|4.0|I have the video set as well and you would have thought that they could have put more footage on the DVDs.<br />The bonus DVD is ok but it's anoying that every scene must be loaded manualy.<br />Good production, lack of extra material, still worth getting if you haven't seen it on video.
B00004Z459|5.0|I like all of the songs, none of them are boring or anything.
B00003CXIY|2.0|I was expecting a laugh-riot the likes of \\"American Pie.\\" Instead what I got was a cheap imitation and another annoying performance by Tom Green. While I'm thankful that he's barely in the movie (Green can't act and isn't funny anyway), he's still in it, meaning he's still annoying. Breckin Meyer and Seann William Scott are the only reasons to see this movie. While true, Scott's character in this is a carbon copy of his Stifler character in the funnier \\"American Pie\\" films, it still works here. There are a few good belly laughs in this movie, but overall it is a forgettable experience and just a ho-hum movie. The unrated version really doesn't enhance the movie at all. Actually, any differences between the R-rated and Unrated go completely unnoticed, proving that unrated versions are 90% of the time entirely useless.
0385504209|5.0|Suppose the church's teachings about Jesus were completely wrong.  Instead of being a celibate divinity, he was a very mortal who married and sired a line of descendents that still exists in the 21st Century and appointed his wife as the first head of the church.  And, suppose an organization exists to protect this knowledge, pass it on and, at the right moment, reveal it to all mankind.  That's the jumping off point for Dan Brown's superb and engaging novel, The Da Vinci Code, if novel is a sufficient term to describe the intricate puzzles within puzzles, codes within codes and reflections of reflections that wind through this engaging story.<br />Beyond the puzzles, Brown offers a wealth of historical information, and seems to be fascinated with etymology.  Anyone who can read this novel without at least once going to an encyclopedia or the internet to check one of Brown's revelations is a far better man than I.  If the book has any drawback, it is that he occasionally becomes a bit prosaic, or better said, lets his characters become a bit prosaic when it is necessary to give some of the historic background.  But those parts are few and far between; the quick-moving story more than compensates for the few slow spots.

B000002KCC|5.0|Neil Young's \\"Tonight's the Night\\" is a timeless masterpiece. The album was recorded somewhat haphazardly and apparently in various stages of inebriation, but this all adds to the tragic thematic continuity and tone of the album. What makes this album so refreshing is that its production is not highly polished like Young's more recent efforts. What you get here is a collection of well-written, painfully honest songs that are devoid of the cliches that occasionally mar Young's work. There isn't a bad song on the entire album. These are songs of experience that will resonate deeply if you are looking for an album that provides a penetrating insight into humanity's struggle with tragedy and loss. And, by the way, the album also consistently provides some of the excellent rock music we all love and adore in Neil's collaborations with Crazy Horse. This album will likely be a permanent fixture in your collection.
B00005OM4N|4.0|yea..this may not be Britney's best cd shes made, but its still a awesome dance/shake ur booty cd... no matter wut her voice is like? well the only really worth listening to songs are Boys, I luv rock 'n' roll, Thats where u take me, nto a gurl, not yet a women. Yea... 'i'ma slave for u' scares alot of young pplz.
B00005JLSC|4.0|CHICAGO tells the tale of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) who wants to become a star in the jazz clubs of Chicago.  Unfortunately, she hits a snag on her path to stardom when she murders the man with whom she had been having an affair.  As she is arrested, her idol, jazz chanteuse Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is also taken off to jail for murdering her unfaithful husband.  Roxie watches as the press flock to Velma, thanks to the talents of hot-shot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), and when she eventually gets Flynn to take on her case as well she suddenly finds herself a headliner -- in the newspapers, anyway.<br />Zeta-Jones has the opening number which sets the stage for the musical, and she does a terrific job.  In fact, most of the vocal and dance performances of the cast are excellent.  Gere turns in a solid performance as Billy Flynn, and supporting players Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly steal the spotlight with exceptionally strong numbers.  The biggest disappointment in my mind was in Zellweger's performance -- Roxie is the star of the show and I didn't feel that she truly filled the role. I frequently found her presence distracting.<br />Director Rob Marshall, known previously for directing the television adaptions of the musicals ANNIE and CINDERELLA, helps the audience accept the fact that the characters spontaneously break into song and dance -- a problem in many musicals on screen and on stage -- by making these sequences spring from Roxie's imagination.  The staging of \\"We Both Reached For the Gun\\" is fantastic.<br />I can't speak to how closely Marshall's CHICAGO resembles the current Broadway show or the original Broadway cast.  But in its own light, CHICAGO is a very entertaining film that proves that the musical genre is far from dead.
B00005RFAI|2.0|This is a bad cd. Its really messy. All the songs sounds messed up alittle. Except maybe her singles. But i mean...California? Thats a bad song. And My Vietnam? GOd? What was she on when she picked it? Well i'm not sayign its an all bad cd. I really do injoy ' Get the party started' and ' Missundaztood'. And ' 18' wheeler. Thats about it... i suggest u jus download the songs. Alot easier n cheaper.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The Chamber of Secrets is a really good movie, and more exciting, thrilling, and darker than The Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone was a great introduction, and it was a pretty good movie, too. It's probably even better for families who will be watching with kids, because The Chamber of Secrets is pretty intense. For anyone wanting a thrilling movie (or any of the adjectives I've used above, for that matter) than The Chamber of Secrets is a good pick.<BR>My guess is that the next Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, will be even darker. And I wouldn't worry about The Goblet of Fire getting massacred too badly. If The Matrix sequels do well, than the studio might release the Goblet of Fire in two parts with a couple of months in between. Each part would, I guess, be two or three hours.
0880389052|5.0|Drizzt is my most favorite character of all time. Nothing, in my opinion, can compare to how this charcter is portrayed. This book is about Drizzt from his birth to his exile. Learning about the drow society was amazing and the details of this culture seem so real. Nothing I ever read was so detailed about a culture that doesn't even existed. R. A Salvatore wrote about the sights and smells about Drizzt's birthplace Menzoberranzan which made you love and hate it at the same time. It made you understand about his evil heritage. Knowing that his race done things the way they done for centuries he finally feels conflicted. He also wonders if other drow were like him. Realizing that if you don't follow the way of the drow means ultimate death. Drizzt follows his heart and realize what he must do in order to survive.
B000089RVX|4.0|Wow, the sound of this band is like a cross between the early Lee Aaron or Lita Ford with Sarah McLachlan on vocals.  Etheral voice was an accurate description.<br />Someone uploaded a demo track to me and I loved the sound.  I haven't bought a new CD in about 5 years.  I'll be buying this one.
B000083E79|5.0|Cher continues to amaze me 34 years after I first heard her.  This is such a great compilation of songs with only a few ommissions that would have made it perfect (The Way of Love and current single \\"When The Money's Gone/Love One Another\\").  She has had #1's in the 60's, 70's, a top ten in the 80's and #1's in the 90's.  Now in the new century she has having a great run on the album chart with this debut at # 7 on Billboard's 200 Album chart for the week ending April 19, 2003.  Congratulations Cher and this is a MUST HAVE for any fan and any wannabe fan.
B00008DDXC|3.0|The film is visually pleasing and executed very well, as should be expected from those who created it. The problem with it is the &quot;I've seen it all before symdrome.&quot; It really doesn't try to break any ground, or show us that the edge is being pushed. I compare this to the new Matrix movie coming out, which will definitely push the edges of moviemaking. If your going to make a visual &quot;wowee zowee&quot; flick, try to instill some &quot;hey look at that&quot; stuff into the movie, or make the story twist and turn a bit more. Maybe diverting from the book a bit more will help, because what sometimes works in books, doesn't transfer to the big screen. Good movie overall though.
B000002NAK|5.0|This CD is one of the best albums ever made. Madonna is fantastic. I became a fan of Madonna's because of this movie. I never liked Madonna until I watched Evita. I love the song Buenos Aires by Madonna. I also love Don't Cry For Me Argentina. I have listened to this CD over 20 times. I know the words by heart. If you have not seen Evita go to Blockbuster Video and rent it. I also became a fan of Eva Peron's once I watched this movie. I strongly suggest watching this fantastic movie. You will not be sorry. There are some great songs here.
B00008IAMD|5.0|As a marriage and family therapist, I am confronted every day of my professional life with how people spend (or misspend) their lives.   <BR>It is too true, I think, that by the time we become adults (maybe by age 40), some of our life is an example, and some is a warning.  Johnny Cash's video, &quot;Hurt,&quot; is a remarkably moving testament to what it means to look back and to take in, in a deep way, the reality of one's life (not that any of us are very good at that).  I caught snippets that video on TV, and was compelled to buy the album and bonus DVD video.  If only for that video and for the anthem it embodies, my money was more than well spent.  I may buy more copies and send them to my adult children (the youngest of whom is 30).  But, even so, I don't know if they'll get it.  <br />But I get it:<br />&quot;If I could start again<BR>A million miles away<BR>I would keep myself<BR>I would find a way.&quot;
B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary is absolutely the best film I have seen in a very long time, and one of the best I have ever seen. I won't spend any time going over the plot because, if you're reading this, chances are you already know it. This is the first Hollywood film I have seen that treats BDSM relationships in a realistic, and (most importantly) non-judgemental manner. Many scenes in this film will certainly ring true for anyone involved in the lifestyle. <br />The acting is, in a word, superb. James Spader turns in his usual high-caliber performance, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is stunning(and beautiful as well!) She conveys more emotion with a single glance than most actresses could in a lengthy monologue. Jeremy Davies also performs quite well in his rather small part. My only quibble with this film is a very minor one: it would have been nice if the story had given a little more background on Mr. Grey. All in all, a top notch film. I will watch it again and again, and I highly recommend it to all open-minded movie fans. Just keep the kids away from the set while you watch it!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|If you don't know Kurosawa's work, this film is an excellent start. If you like western movies, check out Kurosawa's samurai films. Who do you think brought the American western movies back to life? Ever seen the Magnificent Seven? You can thank Kurosawa for that. Not the film itself, just the story line and brilliant message. Dreams is an enchanting visual experience besides a commentary on war and humanity. Do yourself a favor and find out why western film makers have been stealing Kurosawa's chops for decades. Go to the original master source.
B00008DDXL|3.0|If you only watch the movie, I think you will be confused, yet entertained. If you have read the book, you will be disappointed. Many parts of the book are cut, yet other parts of those particular storylines are still included, it doesn't make sense at times. It's still pretty good, but could have used more, I realize it's so long already, but I hope that for the others they will split it into 2 movies (or more in the case of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (706 whopping pages!). This would be a better idea, just like they do with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Overall, enjoyable, but the book is SOOOO much better. Be literate people =)

B00006IUL7|1.0|Clostrophobic non thriller with Pacino overacting all the way through it. Weak premise, weak plot only watch it if YOU are an insomniac and you've gone through your entire DVD stash!
B000002KHB|5.0|One critic has written that this is one of three in the 'Holy Trinity' of metal albums, with Sabbath's Paranoid and Zeppelin's ZOSO. Though this album tends to be the most underrated out of the three. This album is such a classic and has influenced so many hard rock bands that its importance is incalculable. &quot;Highway Star,&quot; &quot;Maybe I'm A Leo,&quot; &quot;Smoke on the Water,&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin&quot; are legendary songs, and this lineup of Deep Purple (Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillian, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, Jon Lords) put out some of the greatest hard rock ever with Machine Head. Recommended totally if you want some bone-crunching, riff-based rock with amazing solos by Blackmore and Lords.
B000003S0D|5.0|King Crimson has gone through many changes since its inception, but it was always a case of brilliant musicians replacing brilliant musicians, and there's really no room to give you any band history here; I'd rather discuss this most phenomenal album.  What's special about LIZARD (1970) is the contribution from the jazz players.  Mark Charig (cornet) and Nick Evans (trombone, can be heard on Soft Machine THIRD) were joined by the dazzling Keith Tippet (returning on piano).  These three musicians were instrumental in generating much of this music's added enchantment.  And, here again, we get Pete Sinfield's captivating lyrics, which are a world unto themselves and some of the most entertaining lyrics in all of rock.<br />The magic begins at once with the hushed introduction to &quot;Cirkus.&quot;  The theme is peaceful and the embellishment almost twinkles.  Then the band kicks in with a loud, eerie, minor-infused, twisted-smile-like riff and the song proceeds, the guitar and drums refreshingly hitting all the accents you wouldn't expect them to.  And at the end, Mark Charig's trumpet solo takes us to the stratosphere.  &quot;Indoor Games&quot; is a complete change of mood.  Andy McCulloch's drumming is superb in this intensely bluesy piece.  The bridge gets cosmic, and then there's a pleasingly playful improvisation between sax and guitar.  The end is a gas, as Gordon Haskell's laughter (and such) abruptly segues to the highly sardonic opening riff (more twisted-smile stuff) of &quot;Happy Family.&quot;  Here, we are delighted by Tippet's deliciously &quot;out&quot; piano playing, Haskell's very altered vocals and another stellar group-jam with flute and trombone.  (It's pretty easy to guess that this song is about The Beatles.)  &quot;Lady Of The Dancing Water&quot; is a gorgeous tune, beautifully sung and beautifully ornamented with guitar, flute and trombone.  Piano and percussion also make a subtle appearance in this calming, wonderfully lazy tune.<br />The haunting voice of Jon Anderson (Yes) mystifies us in the opening section of the title cut.  Keith Tippet blows us away with his brilliant countermelodies.  When &quot;Bolero--The Peacock's Tale&quot; begins, mellotron enters and we are given a grand, wordless treatment of the verse theme--absolutely breathtaking in its beauty!  Toward the end of the oboe solo, Tippet's piano hints of the bluesy improvisation to come.  The horns then create the most spellbinding and meaningful improvisation on a theme I've ever heard on a rock album--enthralling in its detail, brilliant in its invention.  The music resolves, the ad-libbing goes away and the oboe returns to the gorgeous theme from before.  The Bolero section ends, and we get quite a foreboding atmosphere as we enter &quot;Battle Of The Glass Tears.&quot;  The battle begins--the drums wickedly bizarre, a menacing sax riff enters and the band eventually improvises around this eeriness.  After this fit of group interplay comes &quot;Prince Rupert's Lament,&quot; a gut-wrenching guitar solo by Fripp that cries in anguish.  And finally, the playful absurdity of &quot;Big Top&quot; (remember &quot;Cirkus&quot;?) eases the anguish from that pain-filled guitar solo.<br />I don't know if this is my favorite rock album, but it's close.  I usually point to LIZARD as one of the most brilliant rock albums because rock, jazz, intense imagination and incredible musicianship intelligently collide to produce one thoroughly engaging work of art.  It is a monument of the genre.  I can't recommend this strongly enough to those who enjoy their music on the progressive side.  It differs in sound from all other King Crimson albums, but it is the most developed, the most advanced of any they made.  Because there is so much thematic detail involved here, LIZARD will grow on you the more you listen to it.  The music is deep, and richly rewarding.<br />LIZARD also has the coolest album cover ever.  But you really need the vinyl LP jacket to see allthe detail.  Don't pass this by.<br />Cheers,<br />Murraythe detail.  Don't pass this by.<br />Cheers,<br />Murray
0783225733|5.0|This movie always makes me cry at the end, even though everyone knows how it ends...The suspense, the action, the fear palpable throughout the entire movie just makes the whole thing real for a new generation of people who weren't there when it happened.  If more of history was protrayed like this I might just be a history buff!
B00006CXSS|5.0|at least if america was invaded it would take them longer to capture one city than it took the germans to capture all of poland.

6304708491|2.0|Obviously this is a fantastic movie, but what about the DVD? Well, honestly, the quality is pretty bad. The film transfer isn't very pretty, it's in FULL SCREEN as opposed to its original widescreen ratio, and the sound quality is an insult for any music-based film, let alone The Beatles. <br />[...]<br />Also, this version has zippo extras. A Hard Days' Night has some nice bonus features, so surely the next Help! DVD will, as well.<br />Hold off 'till we get the good version! Just dust off your old copy of Help! on VHS, 'cos this version literally is no better.
B00000DOYH|5.0|Led Zeppelin doubles up on the fun in this 1975 double album, which makes sense since it had been two years since the release of \\"Houses of the Holy.\\"  Repeated listening makes it clear that each disc should be taken on its own terms.  Every time I listen to Disc One of \\"Physical Graffiti\\" I come to the conclusion that most of these songs were created out of jam sessions, as opposed to Page and Plant sitting down in the living room and working on tunes. You get the feeling Jimmy Page was fooling around, found some guitar riff that he liked and then Led Zeppelin fashioned an entire song out of it (e.g., \\"Custard Pie\\" and \\"Houses of the Holy\\"). The same thing with John Paul Jones's organ work on \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and John Bonham's drumming on \\"Kashmir.\\" Clearly \\"Physical Graffiti\\" is Led Zeppelin's most collaborative album, with Jones and Bonham getting credits on six of the 15 tracks. While \\"Kashmir\\" has always been the most recognizable song on the album, long before Puff Daddy remixed it for the giant green lizard movie bomb, the group's true showpiece is the 11:08 \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" which finally gets the boys back in the neighborhood of the blues (along with \\"Boogie With Stu\\" and a few other tracks). \\"Dying\\" is the longest studio track in the entire Led Zep repertoire and one of four songs 6:55 or longer on the album. Who needs A.M. Top 40 air play?<br />In contrast Disc Two contain the lighter songs, the acoustic \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" and the cutesy \\"Down By The Seaside,\\" as well as another attempt to duplicate \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" before getting back to big time rock and roll (e.g., \\"The Wanton Song\\" and \\"Sick Again\\").  This is clearly the more experimental disc in the set, although I would not go so far as to suggest that the second comprises the \\"graffti\\" to the \\"physical\\" first.  More than any other Led Zeppelin album, \\"Physical Graffiti\\" reminds us that while Page and Plant were always out in front the rhythm section of Jones and Bonham was equally as good, even if the pair were under appreciated in comparison. Along with their first and fourth albums, this is one of Led Zeppelin's best, its filler cuts more than compensated for by the overall ambition of the effort.nham was equally as good, even if the pair were under appreciated in comparison.

B00007E8O5|4.0|I think Roadrunner, the record company, was right in releasing this in single-disc form, especially after looking at the track listing and seeing that all of my favorites from this double comprise the single-disc. Of course, that album didn't include Pig Charmer, What It Takes, and the creepy Feel The Void, all great tracks in their own right! I don't really like some of the samey-sounding, thud-y riff rock stuff on here as much as when Jerry creates an ably creepy atmosphere on songs like Psychotic Break and Solitude. If you're a Chains and Jerry fan perusing this album and are curious, then this or at least the single-disc are highly recommended.
B00005MAM2|5.0|At least until \\"Spirited Away\\" becomes available on DVD this week there is essentialy a tossup between \\"Akira\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\" as to which film should serve as the introduction of a neophyte to the wonderful world of anime.  Either film would serve just fine and while I watched \\"Mononoke-hime\\" first, I would recommend \\"Akira\\" as the first choice.  However, whichever way you go if this is your first anime film you need to be aware that all of these films set standards that will put most other films in the genre to shame.<br />Katsuhiro Ôtomo's 1988 masterpiece is a cyperbunk epic about a group of teenage bikers in neo-Tokyo who get caught up in top secret experiments by the government.  But what could be simply a collison between \\"The Wild One\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" becomes much more in Ôtomo's hands.  The notion that the film is \\"visually excessive\\" is a gross understatement; for those who have tolerated the minimalist animation and recurring film loops of animation on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, \\"Akira\\" is as far removed from cheap Saturday morning cartoons as you can get.  As far as Ôtomo is concerned even when it comes to the faces in the background crowd, attention must be paid.<br />The story is a distillation of years of Ôtomo's manga and why those who have actually read all of \\"Akira\\" books can bemoan that which has been ommitted in the same manner those who loved Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" lamented the David Lynch film, I think those of us who are completely ignorant of Ôtomo's epic can understand and enjoy the film version (due in large measure to a new and improved dub on the DVD).  Obviously there is more depth to the story of \\"Akira,\\" and many will no doubt be inspired to check out the American reprints of the manga to enjoy the story in its entirety, but Ôtomo has clearly taken pains to craft this \\"short\\" (124 minute) version for general consumption.<br />A confrontation between rival biker gangs leads to an encounter with an odd looking child before all of them are whisked away by the military.  We then learn about the legendary Akira, a psychic who destroyed Tokyo a generation earlier with a powerful mind blast.  The government is try to understand and harness the power of these psychics and when they take Tetsuo, one of the bikers, to experiment on at their secret base it is up to Kaneda to rescue his friend (and impress the girl, Kel).  Then Tetsuo not only gains godlike powers but goes insane and the future of everyone and everything is called into question.<br />Ultimately, \\"Akira\\" triumphs because the story is as complex as the animation is detailed (160,000 cells).  The characters might be the stereotypical conventions of the genre but Ôtomo brings nuances to all of them, sometimes through nothing more than the look on their face.  \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" is my favorite anime, but \\"Akira\\" is the most impressive I have seen to date.\\"  Even without Disc 2 in this Special Edition \\"Akira\\" rates five stars, but the extra material is extremely impressive, bearing witness to Ôtomo's obsession with cramming detail into every single frame (e.g., Hauryki-Ya, the biker's seedy bar hangout).  \\"Akira Sound Clip\\" looks at the Taiko drum influenced soundtrack by Geinoh Yamashiro Gumi and there are other features, some of which were made for Japanese comic conventions, and most of which are treats for fans of Ôtomo and his film.ing child before all of them are whisked away by the military.

0783225857|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a classic, a masterpiece, and it is Gregory Peck at his prime. Peck, in his Oscar-winning role, is Atticus Finch, a widowed Southern lawyer, who defends Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a black man, who was accused of raping a white woman in Alabama, in the 1930s. At home, he raises his son, Jem (Philip Alford), and his daughter, Scout (Mary Badham, Oscar-nominated), and teaches them about compassion and the evils of prejudice. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is the second best movie of 1962, next to \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", and one of the best and most important movies of the 1960s. If you have not seen this movie, rent it, or buy it on DVD (which is what I own on) or video, to add it to your collection. Read the book, too.
B000002P2V|5.0|If you take a real listen to this album, you will soon realize that this is on of The Who's finest efforts. I place it on par with Who's Next and Quadrophenia, which are my other favorite albums. Classic Townshend with strong Daltry vocals and Entwistle basslines. Classic Who aggression captured in great songs
B000002H72|5.0|This is honestly one of the most inspirational albums I have ever listened to. The Pixies have mastered the art of blending grunge with commercial pop on this album, and it sounds good!! &quot;Debaser&quot; is a great way to greet the listener and prepare them for what there is to come, and &quot;Here Come's Your Man&quot; is an addictively catchy song with an unbeatable melody. However, I think the best track on this entire record is &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven,&quot; because shows the more solomn and powerful side of the Pixies that paved the way for many of Nirvana's best songs. If you like Nevermind then buy this CD.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The Chamber of secrets is truly an amazing movie; like all other films based on much-loved books it underwent harsh criticism from several reviewers for not living up to the book.  However, I deliberately did not reread the book just before seeing the movie and I found that it kept me from constantly comparing it to the book through the entirety of the film.<br />The film is so wonderful because it is really in the spirit of Harry Potter--we see characters become more viable and real in this second film.  The kids are growing up, and it shows.  I feel that this is entirely appropriate for the feel of the film, since a large part of the books revolves around typical growing pains that we all go through.<br />Would I recommend this movie for younger ones?  Not necessarily, unless they are mature or do not scare easily.  This movie is a bit darker than the first, and they are sure to become progressively more so (to the delight of older fans who have grown up with the books).<br />Personally, I can't wait!
B00008MNYS|5.0|Having never heard of Robbie Williams before, I didn't know what to expect.  I bought this CD based on a review I'd read in a magazine and became an instant fan.  You can't go wrong with this CD!
B00008AWOD|5.0|If you fel in love with the boys when listening to &quot;Placebo&quot; and &quot;WYIN&quot;, but was dissapointed with &quot;BBM&quot;, then this is the album for you. Placebo goes back to the signature sounds that made them great, while maintaining an interesting new edge. Songs such as the Picture and Special Needs stand out but the truth is that in &quot;SWG&quot; there is something for every musical taste.An excellent CD that nicely portrays the band's maturity and finally shows what they are made of.
B00006M183|4.0|There have been mixed reviews about 2002's Riot Act.  Some people will cite it as Pearl Jam's best album to date, whereas others will say it continues the downward spiral started with Yield.  I (along with a fair number more) am sort of in between.  I have a hard time picking a favorite PJ record.  I like Yield, Vs., No Code... I like them all.  Notwithstanding, Riot Act may not be their best collection; but it's certainly not bad.  All the songs are intriguing one way or another.  Many of the songs are nothing new, but some are.  Here's a brief overview of the 15 tracks:<br />1. Can't Keep - 3.5/5 - The opener features some melodic music and some simplistic words.  It gives the impression of hard rock, but seems delicate at the same time.  It's reminiscent of something from Binaural (that`s rare here).<br />2. Save You - 5/5 - This is as \\"rockin\\" as it gets for Riot Act.  There's a large number of swears (primarily `fxck') and great negativity towards self.  This is undoubtedly one of the album's best; as it reminds me of a cross between \\"Hail, Hail\\" and \\"Brain Of J.\\".<br />3. Love Boat Captain - 4/5 - It's really an amazing track.  It's a good change from track two; both lyrically and musically.  The line `all you need is love' is quite different from `and fxck me if I say something you don't wanna hear' (in \\"Save You\\").  It starts slow, but picks up as it moves on.<br />4. Cropduster - 2.5/5 - Again, No Code comes to mind when hearing this song.  There's really nothing special within the music, but the words are surprising and (to some extent) enjoyable.<br />5. Ghost - 5/5 - This one has a very jittery start; which is good.  It's actually a favorite of mine since the chorus is very catchy.  I was a little startled by the short guitar solos, but you'll learn to love them over time.  Take note of the line `seeking new ways / before I miss it all'.<br />6. I Am Mine - 4.5/5 - I can easily see why this was the first single.  It's a great song, and leaves you wanting more.  Hence... you'll buy the CD.  And once you do that, you will soon realize there are other tracks that are better.  Eddie really gets personal here; don`t overlook it.<br />7. Thumbing My Way - 4.5/5 - Nothing too spectacular, but one of the few original songs.  And again, the music picks up as the song goes along.  This one just might be a hidden gem on Riot Act (even though some people say it`s the best).<br />8. You Are - 5/5 - This single-bound track holds (maybe) the best PJ verse ever: `love is a tower / of strength to me / I am the shoreline / but you're the sea'.  It's very refreshing; and features some uncharacteristic pauses, heavy background music, and even some `ooh wah' chants.  No doubt, it's one of the best.<br />9. (Wanted To) Get Right - 5/5 - Once more, No Code will come to mind when you hear this track.  It's fast, quick; and gives us the \\"rockin\\" PJ sound we are all used to.  Also, don't ignore the brilliant lyrics as you enjoy the music.  Unbelievable outgoing solo!<br />10. Green Disease - 3.5/5 - Here's a weird starter with mainly a lot of rhyming.  I have a hard time getting into this track; even though it's very likable.  If you don't appreciate the sound, you'll at least appreciate the lyrics.<br />11. Help Help - 2.5/5 - The opening stanza, `tell me what I wanna hear / this shxt's too good to be true' is as ironical as it gets for Pearl Jam.  But after the first two lines the song begins to fade.  It could've used a more \\"heavy\\" feel.<br />12. Bushleaguer - 2/5 - Its spoken word start is very, very weak.  That kind of makes it hard to enjoy--and in the end--the worst song on the album.  Had they left out the talking it might've developed into a better track.<br />13. Half Full - 3/5 - Believe it or not, this one has a country-bar feel to it.  Needless to say it is unlike anything else on the CD.  Again it's nothing special, but the fact it's so different makes it somewhat pleasurable.<br />14. Arc - ?/5 - Here Eddie sways in and outof Indian-like melodies for approximately one minute.  It's kind of puzzling and almost to the point of meaningless; but it's so short it won't even phase you.<br />15. All Or None - 5/5 - This is up there, with \\"All Those Yesterdays\\", as one of the best closers Pearl Jam has ever done.  The countless solos really take command of the song, and each line acts as a masterpiece in itself.  It's definitely one of the best.<br />For some people it may be weird to see Eddie Vedder without his grunge-ish haircut and vaporous look.  It seems the band have waived bye-bye to the years of grunge music and the comparisons to Alice In Chains and Soundgarden.  Their sound has certainly changed from Ten, but their prominence has not.  If you are an all-around Pearl Jam \\"fan\\", you will love this album.  Riot Act mixes the sound of most of the band's work (No Code, Yield, Binaural, Vs., and even some Vitalogy); and does a pretty good job when it's said and done.  I will say this is not PJ's best album.  But songs like \\"Get Right\\" and \\"Save You\\" are clearly among their best... ever.  Riot Act deserves a very strong 4 stars.  It's different, it's the same, it's noteworthy; but most importantly it's good music.

B00006690H|4.0|this is a good cd, i'll admit. but if you really want it, buy the explicit version. i bought the clean verson (thats all my parents will let me listen to) and it sounds horrable. even though all the songs are good, theres like 20 bleeps a song. its enough to drive you crazy. the \\"without me\\" song is the only one that sounds good. .... don't buy the clean one unless your easily offended, or thats all your parents will let you have.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the best CD that has been released to date. It truly exemplifies the cliche &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;, and is hailed worldwide as a masterpiece, and the best ever. It has everything.
0385504209|5.0|WOW!! It took three pages to get hooked on this book. Then 106 chapters to get unhooked. Every page is exciting. You've GOT to read this book, right now!!<br />Good old Robert Langdon is at it again. He is up to here in adventure and mystery, and bad guys, and beautiful women, guns, and secrets. Besides, he gets around a lot, even without trying. He's got new friends, Sofia, Teabing, Silas, etc. No hints on the story in this review, just excitement about how good and entertaining this read is. I couldn't stop. I carried it around with me, 5 minutes here, 4 hours there, 30 minutes here. There was no escaping until I finished. Even then, I thought about the book for weeks.<br />As in \\"Angles and Demons\\", the research is complete and total. Exotic places and well known places. If you've traveled, you know these sites. It's like being there. And the story line, well, never does it go where you expect, think or guess. And fast paced, sound moves slower.<br />Have no fear about reading this book, you'll enjoy it, or maybe you should be afraid, because if you have something else to do you may be in a quandry. I'm telling you, it's impossible to put this book down.<br />Hat's off to you again Mr. Brown!!!
B000005Z0E|5.0|2pacalypse now is the debut album of the greatest rapper of all time Tupac Shakur, Already on his debut album he has lyrical genious written all over him, while most rappers talk about How rich they are and how many hummers they own in their debut albums, Pac raps about modern day society and war.  Trapped is a great song on this cd, and of course you can't forget Brenda's Got a Baby the song that made him famous...In all of these songs you will hear at least one verse that can still be relevant even after his death...I recommend this CD to anybody new to the world of 2pac!

B00005B6C9|5.0|I always loved the Bee Gees.  They always amaze me.  With the untimely sudden death of Maurice this album is extra special.  He sings two songs on this album.  Man in the Middle and Walking on Air.  I love both songs.  He's a great songwriter and singer.  He puts his heart and soul in every song it shows.  So far there is no song that he sings solo that I don't like.  I love Robin's Embrace.  I love his haunting voice.  There's no voice like his.  I love Secred Trust and Wedding Day which sounds like christmas with the bells added to the song.  I can't say enough about Barry.  His high sexy falsetto still gives me gouse bumps no matter what he sings.  I recommend you buy this album you won't be disappointed.  They sing the way they did when they started out.  Real voices, real instruments.  Happy listening.
B00005JKN9|5.0|A spectacular movie. A tale worthy of notice by any american, young or old. This is a part of history edited out of our schools history lessons. With a terrific performance by Day-Lewis (Bill \\"the Butcher\\" Cutting). Scorses's only fault is trying to put 120 years of history in it. With that descrepancies arrive in the true history. The lifestyles, demeanors, and physical surroundings stay true. This is a fictional story in a real time. The Draft Riots are a spectacle never seen on the screen like this. With all the tense excitement in this film, you'll be asking for more. A great film, by a great director. And the book, by Herbert Ashbury, is even better.
0375414053|4.0|The easy answer to the title question \\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" is: Just throw money at it.  Heroine Kate Reddy, has cash in abundance. Right then, I knew I'd like the book.  I wasn't in for an exhausting drama of baby on hip, phone in ear, mop in hand, and brain numb with juggling finances. Good!<br />Kate is a very well compensated corporate hedge fund manager in The City (in the U.S., translate to Wall Street). Her job is 24/7, stress-filled, and calls for international travel.  She lives in an almost renovated townhouse with her darling almost-perfect husband and two children, baby Ben and kindergartner Emily.  Kate grew up poor with an irresponsible father. Husband Richard's background is achingly comfortable and stable.  That's the setup.  Kate, though awesomely energetic, witty, capable and yes--lovable-- can manage only if Everything Goes Perfectly.  One slip, and the entire structure collapses. She is sleep deprived, nervous, self-punishing and a shocking nag.  The burning question: Can she somehow do a perfect job and be a Perfect Mother and Wife? No, of course, not but contrary to what many reviewers complained about, Kate did not Sell Out when she did the big scam, quit her job and bought a house in the country. You just know the cottage industry she is trying to \\"help\\" with her ever-increasing guidance, will blossom into a hugely successful, Kate-run conglomerate.<br />Kate was inept with her household help.  Her cleaning lady has a back problem that does not allow her to bend or reach over her head; therefore, she can only clean (?) what is right in front of her.  And the Nanny Problem.  How can this be?  We Americans know the English invented nannies and train them so the parents only meet their sweet smelling, well-dressed offspring twice a day.  Not so at Kate's house. I wondered why it wasn't in the job description to have Nanny feed, bathe and pajama the children by the time Kate came home. Also, the English are famous for turning over theirtykes to a good boarding school at an ungodly early age and sustaining only a nodding acquaintance with said tykes thereafter.  Not Kate.  I believe she will strain to keep the children with her until they are both gray haired. It's enough to make you lose faith in the English Way of Life.<br />\\"IDKHSDI's\\" Kate is a vast improvement over Bridget Jones.  Kate doesn't meander through her life.  She has depth and a willingness to change.  She is interesting enough to make the pages fly and we, as readers dream up suggestions by the carload to improve her sense of well being.  Remember you can spend as much of Kate's money you want make things better!<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer
B00005JKBC|4.0|In general, \\"Spy Game\\" is a pretty standard Hollywood espionage flick.  The plot is improbable, the dialogue a little overdetermined, many of the characters [typical].  Yet, despite its faults, I find it to be quite a bit better than the average spy flick.  The set-up in itself is interesting: Robert Redford's character becomes something of a spy within the CIA; the line between good guy and bad guy is not so easily drawn here.  The script is merely serviceable, but the film creates an adrenaline-soaked atmosphere through its jumpy camera-work and unexpected ... twists.  Unlike most action movies, it gives you something to think about, a ... situation to consider and question.  Plus, how many big Hollywood flicks have a juicy, sly Charlotte Rampling cameo?  That in itself deserves credit.

B00006LLLN|5.0|It's about time that the award-winning Alison Krauss and Union Station released a live album, and a double-CD doozy it is! A live DVD of the same show is also forthcoming. Recorded in April, 2002 at the Palace Theater in Louisville, KY as part of their \\"New Favorite\\" tour, the album serves up 25 songs that mix newer material with older hits like Let Me Touch You For Awhile, The Lucky One, Everytime You Say Goodbye, Broadway, Faraway Land, When You Say Nothing At All, and Oh Atlanta. One of the songs (Down to the River to Pray) was recorded live at Austin City Limits. This package is a true testament to the tightness of AKUS, and a live album like this clearly exudes musical energy as the band feeds off the enthusiastic response of a large appreciative audience.  While applause can be slightly annoying, once the band launches into a song, there is little in the way of noise distraction and disruption with the exception of some minimal clapping along on \\"Bright Sunny South.\\" The musicians, soundmen and recording engineer were all doing their jobs right and in professional workmanlike style on those two fateful days in Louisville.<br />Besides Alison, the band includes Barry Bales, Ron Block, Jerry Douglas, Dan Tyminski and on about half of the tracks, guest percussionist Larry Atamanuik. The appearance of this tasteful Nashville session drummer serves to reinforce the eclectic nature of this band's repertoire that is probably best classified as acoustic country, with occasional bluegrass selections. And, it is their instrumental virtuosity and vocal prowess that have personalized their sound and built their large fan base. Tyminiski handles the lead vocals on four tracks, and he's probably at his soulful best singing a song like \\"The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn.\\" Ron Block sings his own composition, \\"Faraway Land.\\" Music arranging has always been a clear strength of this band, and I always especially enjoy hearing how the group capitalizes on Ron Block's versatility as both a guitarist and banjo-player. If only he could play both instruments at once in a live show like this. Four instrumentals are included: Choctaw Hayride, Cluck Old Hen, We Hide and Seek, and Jerry Douglas' solo on A Tribute to Peador O'Donnell/Monkey Let the Hogs Out. The only thing I occasionally miss in AKUS' sound is more mandolin, but Dan Tyminiski does pick that instrument on five tracks. When one audience member shouts \\"I love you, Alison,\\" another chimes in with \\"I love you more.\\" After listening to this project, we'll all surely fall into either the former or latter category of fans.

B000050XEI|5.0|Look around with your ears! Go to a mall, check the television advertisements for future programming, and you will see Enya. You will see her with your ears because nearly every day in your life you will hear a tune playing that is from one of her albums. This work is one of her best. The music is great and &quot;plays in your head&quot; much as her former cuts on previous work such as the &quot;Sail Away&quot; song, this CD is chock full of memorable and pleasant tunes. She even has had one of her cuts used in the classic movie &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and you will find it if you use your ears to look! The best music on the album are &quot;Wild Child,&quot; &quot;Pilgrim&quot;,&quot;Lazy Days&quot;, &quot;One by One&quot;, and perhaps the greatest and most memorable, used by countless shows on television and commercials is &quot;only time&quot;. If the CD has any weakness it is &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; due to the ancient language use and sounding as if perhaps we are attending a satanic ritual and a curse is being called up. Overall it is great, just skip track 4.
0345423496|1.0|This book is terrible.  I loved the other books in the series.  Not only are the characters shallow and undeveloped, the plot thin, but the actual writing is terrible.  It seems there at least three exclamation points per paragraph. &quot;I'm sure confused! This is the future! That's nice!&quot;<br />I think that Clarke must have a grandson or something who is learning how to write and used his grandpa's name on this book.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Wow, I have heard some negative reviews of this 2 disc release.<BR>No one is holding a gun to your head to buy it.<BR>Even though i own the remastered one disc version of Who's Next,i decided i had to have this Deluxe Version.<BR>One of the timeless great albums of the 70's. How could anyone not give Who's next anything less then a five star review. If your mad because you have to buy this version of Who's next then don't give your opinion of a review. Let us review the music on these discs and not silly soapbox complaining. This release is for serious Who fans who need great stuff like this on cd.<BR>The whole second disc makes it hard to pass up on the Deluxe Version of Who's Next. Even the first Cd is a little different then the 1 Disc version of Who's Next. This is a beautiful collection of Who songs. If band's made music like this nowadays i wouldn't be looking into buying music from the 70's. Today there is so much junk musak and pop that listening to the Who is a breathe of fresh air and a joy. Look past complaining about the Deluxe Version and just pick it up and listen to it. It's great music and i think some fans have lost site of that. One of the classic albums of the early 70's and it sounds better then ever.
B000000ORE|5.0|This was the first cd that I got of Tesla.  I believe it to be the best.  It has one of their biggest hits, \\"Love Song\\".  The cd rocks pretty hard compared to some of their later stuff.
B000002HRE|4.0|Not as good as Metallicas other albums but not bad! People say this is a bad Metallica album but its not. Yes I know ts not the \\"Black Album\\", or \\"....And Justice For All\\" but this is a great album. with songs like \\"Fuel\\", \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"Devils Dance\\", \\"The Unforgiven II\\" and \\"Attatude\\" how could you not like this album! The rest of the songs on the album are all right but these are the true gems! This is not for fans of the 'Trash' Metallica. But if you want a great Hard Rock album, then this is for you!
B000000OQ5|5.0|This is a great cd.  It has some real hard rockers such as \\"coming atcha live\\",\\"Rock me to the top\\" and \\"2 late 4 love\\".  Although, it does have a couple easier going songs, \\"we're no good together\\" and \\"before my eyes\\".  This is a must have recording!!
B000002G87|5.0|When you have two of the greatest guitar players of all time in one band you can expact a lot. Duane Allman is the greatest slide guitar player of all time. Eric Clapton is in the top 5 guitar players of all time. Derek And The Dominos was a super group! This album has the greatest guitar playing ever recorded! &quot;Key To The Highway&quot; is an amazing jam. I dont need to say anything about the title track cause its just incredable! &quot;Thorn Tree In The Garden&quot; is a beautiful love song. &quot;I Looked Away&quot; and &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; are to of my favorite songs on the album. &quot;Little Wing&quot; is a Hendrixs classic that Clapton makes his own.&quot;No one Knows You When Your Down And Out&quot; has amazing lyrics, and amazing guitar. &quot;Have Your Ever Loved A Women&quot; is superb. &quot;Why Does Love Got To Be So Bad&quot; is great! All the other songs on this album are good as well but these are the songs that really stand out. Get this album and you wount be let down. And you'll know why people say 'Clapton Is God.'  R.I.P. Duane
B00008DDXC|4.0|The first edition I had was a copy from China for a little over a dollar, since the DVD wasn't released yet, and I missed the cinema run. There were many scenes missing, but I liked the movie. Then I bought a set of 3 VCDs for 7 Dollar. Some more scenes included, but still some scenes missing, e.g. how does Hagrid know that it wasn't Harry when he storms into Dumbledores office? In the Book he met Harry, but not in the movie. Now the question: shall I buy the DVD for 40 Euro in the hope for more scenes or not? And why does the DVD cost 17 Dollars in the US and 40 Euro in Europe?
B000001FG5|5.0|I say this is the sequel to their \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" album.  I can't get enough of their song \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" which is very spiritual and catchy.  I envision angels dancing on stage to this song.  Their big hit \\"Tragedy\\" which I heard many times on radio.  You just have to listen to Barry's song \\"Until\\".  They use just his  voice and sounds like harps in the background.  His high falsetto and sexy voice is beautiful in this song and leaves me with goose bumps it's a test of how powerful his voice is.  \\"Inside and Out\\" another of their hits is a great song.  Songs like \\"Search, find\\" a test to there strong harmonies and how good they sing together. You should buy this album you won't be dissappointed.  It's the Bee Gees best ever.  Happy listening.
B000089A07|3.0|Just because there were three &quot;Lecter&quot; books written doesn't mean they should have made them all into films.  Manhunter and Silence were enough.  Overdosing on Hannibal Lecter makes him less and less scary(Hellraiser suffered the same fate in the sequels by desensitizing us to Pinhead).  My main gripe withh this is the same as most reviewers that gave this a negative review: Edward Norton.  As much as I admire Edward Norton, he was just a bad choice.  That character called for someone totally different.  I think I speak for most people when I say that when reading the book, you don't picture anyone remotely like Edward Norton as Graham.  Ralph Fiennes was okay I guess.  Emily Watson was decent with her extremely cutesy , wild googily eyed look.  Keitel was there just coz they needed an older stern looking guy for Crawford(I guess Scott Glen wasn't available this time).  People knock Keitel in this, but I think he did what he could with the not-so-demanding role of Jack Crawford.  Hoffman was completely wrong for Lounds.  This movie wasn't terrible or anything(that title goes to Hannibal), but it has a very strong &quot;been there, done that&quot; vibe going on all through it.  I think it was very late in the game to make this film, coz it offers nothing that we didn't already see in Silence Of The Lambs or Manhunter(if you saw that one!).
B00005JKJA|5.0|This may sound strange to someone who hasn´t watched this movie,  but I´ve seen this movie only once,  and have pretty much no idea what it´s about,  but I absolutely loved it.  In my group of friends,  I´m the guy who likes the &quot;weird&quot; movies,  and I have to say this was the weirdest movie I have ever seen.  People ask,  &quot;Well,  you loved it so much.  What is it about?&quot;  I have no way of answering that question at this point.  I can´t even say what genre I think it is,  it´s in it´s own genre.  If you are into good movies that confuse you and make you think,  this is THE movie to watch.  It sits above all the rest of it´s kind.  <br />And I´ve never seen a director use the camera the way David Lynch does.  I can compare David Lynch´s filming to Radiohead´s music: innovative and just thier own. Don´t try and figure it out the first time,  just sit back and enjoy the ride,  it´s the ultimate mind-bending movie ride.
B000002NZO|4.0|&quot;Trespass&quot; is one of the most underated works of Genesis.It came in 1970, shortly after unpopular debut &quot;From genesis to revelation&quot;.After some experiments with sixties pop music Group entered the progressive rock area with a really shocking results...With a little changes in squad (Drumer Chris Steward left before the recording) they have recorded one of they most &quot;spiritual&quot; and mind-moving albums in the seventies.Of course it is not so Strong as &quot;Selling england by the pound&quot; or &quot;Foxtrot&quot; but still beautifull.<br />1.&quot;LOOKING FOR SOMEONE&quot; 5/5 - Peter Gabriel vocals are highlits here.It starts quite peacefull but during the this 7 minutes really a lot of things are happening.A sudden changes of tempo and moods.Extraordinary Vocals and organs(Tony Banks is more than great...).So many emotions in one song..... <BR>2.&quot;WHITE MOUNTAIN&quot; 4/5 - A song about some foreign old land (Kingdom???). It's a Kind of music fairytaile...when i always listen to this track i imagine myself castles and knights (Maybe it's stupid,but it's true...).A bit gloomy but very interesting.Nice acoustic guitars...<BR>3.&quot;VISIONS OF ANGELS&quot; 5/5 - &quot;Spiritual&quot; tune.Cherfull and magical atmosphere.Rather queit song and a great choral ending.Seems to be nothing special but after several listenings it stays in your head for long...<BR>4.&quot;STAGNATION&quot; 5/5 - Propably the best song from the album.Some powerfull chorals,Great Bridges and Gabriels Voice...You just have to listen it on your own...Still Dreamlike atmosphere.<BR>5.&quot;DUSK&quot; 3/5 - The weakest piece here.It is acoustic song,Could be wonderfull but the backing vocals of Banks,Rutheford and Phillips are just iritating.<BR>6.&quot;THE KNIFE&quot; 4/5 - Powerfull hard rock song.Very strong fuzz Bass line and noisy guitars.Gabriels voice sometimes sounds to &quot;Thin&quot; in this piece but he always sings the best as he can(Maybe it is a faultof producer).Genesis wouldn't be theirselfs if they do not made some progressive bridge here(some samples from an old war movie)....Banks majestic organs are floating above everything...Sadly &quot;The knife&quot; is not fitting here because it is to agressive.Of course it its a great song but sounds much better on &quot;GENESIS LIVE&quot;.<br />Overall,there's no Phil Collins or Steve Hackett here.There is no pop songs or nothing so eponymous like &quot;Suppers ready&quot; (From &quot;Foxtrot&quot;).Still it's a big piece of great art and progressive rock music.If you are a fan of good music and you never heard (very) early genesis i recomend this to you.You will be not dissapointed
B00006690G|2.0|Eminems getting old. His lyrics make you want to commit suicide, He makes fun of everyone, including fans, every other word is a cuse word, & he talks about raping his own mother and ex. Thats exactly what we want the youth of America listening to.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 brings to us a brilliant mix of soul, rock, funk, and R&B so slickly crafted that most people wont know how to take them.  The intense vocal range of frontman Adam Levine is matched perfectly by this incredibly smooth band.  Dueling guitars, jazzy keys, and a rhythm section cooler than Barry White in the late 70s bring this massive sound to a head.<br />The harmonies brought forth on this disc bear an uncanny resemblance to Michael Jackson, though the utter lack of synth-pop backing, creates a sound all its own.  The album, Songs About Jane, is clearly devoted primarily the relationships and love-life of Levine, who is also the bands main songwriter.  Probably the most outright pop tune on the album would be She Will be Loved, which happens to tell the most interesting story lyrically.  This track is apparently about the singers infatuation and empathy toward an attractive young prostitute, who he visits frequently in an attempt to make her feel as beautiful as she is.<br />It is difficult to pick out standout tracks on an album like this, where every song is so equally fantastic.  The...funk-tastic tune Not Coming Home, along with the slowed down lounge groove, Secret, are 2 of my personal favorites, although every song on here has strength alone.  The first single, which to this point has only received minimal notice and success, Harder to Breathe, is clearly the most alternative of the album.  Sweetest Goodbye is also a great way to wrap this album up and leave the listener smiling from this R&B tinged love song.<br />Overall, this may be one of the best albums of 2002.  The talent for writing great pop tunes that stray from the synth-pop and electronic influences of current radio mainstays may make this album great, but I can imagine the difficulty in marketing a band like this to mainstream audiences who fight tooth and nail to place everything in categories and genres.  If you really want a great band to chill and relax to, but one that never falls into the category of background music then Maroon 5 is for you.  And if youre a woman, age 18-30 and youre single, check out Maroon 5 live, because from listening to Mr. Levines lyrics, I can tell you one thing  this guy LOVES women.<BR>9/10<
B00006I53S|5.0|I have this on a Canon Elan 7e.  It's really great.
B000069HK2|5.0|With as much music as I listen to, I am constantly searching for something new.  While listening to the Atticus compilation, I happened across a band called \\"The Used\\", with their first single, \\"A Box Full of Sharp Objects\\".  My ears perked up as I heard this new style of melodic hardcore.  What is new about it, is the fact that this isn't hardcore music with melodic vocals, but a schizophrenic, constantly mutating mix of beautifully clean melodic rock, and gut wrenching hardcore.  In their first full length, The Used tear through 13 new songs, always varying between sweet melodies and brutal screams.  The album opens up with its only let down, \\"Maybe Memories\\".  This song sounds like it was stolen directly from an older Deftones album.  The second track, \\"The Taste of Ink\\", pushes the album in its true direction.  The vocals and lyrics on this album, no matter how talented the band may be, are what set The Used apart from the rest of this scene.  Vocalist, Bert, has one of the most incredible ranges I have ever heard in this style of music.  The lyrics are so well written and honest, full of agonizing wonder, tragedy and triumph, there is a song for everyone on this album.  As a whole, the album leans more to a pop feel than it does hardcore, but in this case, that does not diminish the artistic impact the album makes.  The album presses forward with its infectious rock, overlain vocals, and screams at the most perfect placements.  The one acoustic song on the album is definitely a stand out.  Instead of leaning toward the usual heartbroken emo sound that will generally be found in an albums \\"sole acoustic song\\", the song touches upon solitude and the bliss of ignorance.  After the album closes out with \\"Pieces Mended\\", which is a great track to tie the rest of the work together, the band sneaks in a brutally hardcore secret song, about 6 minutes after the last track ends.  I can't stress how much I recommend this album.<BR>Rating:  9/10<br />For reviews like thisand much more, visit bigtouchin.com
B000065V41|2.0|Okay, Many a folk has wondered why this long anticipated DVD is in fullscreen rather than widescreen.  Here's my answer:<br />In the original movie there were more scenes.  For example, when scrooge is at his desk in the beginning and beaker and his budy come in, they are supposed to sing a song.  The same with the Eagle when Scrooge goes to christmases past and is with the the eagle.  These songs, along with other scenes, were omitted in the VHS edition which many have come to love because they forgot about the original songs.<br />I suspect this is also why the soundtrack is amost impossible to find.  I got it when the theatre version came out, but I haven't seen it since!  Both of the deleted songs are on the tape though!<br />Hopefully the execs will get their heads on straight and release a good DVD, otherwise I recommend sticking with the video until other notice!<br />Although I gave the DVD 2-stars, the movie in itself if a muppet classic and very good!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Lets start out by saying that Linkin Park has been one of my guilty pleasures since One Step Closer had debuted as the bands first radio single.  Thus, when Meteora was released, I made sure to snatch it up early.  Like many fans, I have been waiting to see how their next full length would fare against the grotesque mesh of singles that made up Hybrid Theory.  Overall, it can be simply stated that Meteora, although a more mature step for the band, will probably not win over any new fans.  If you remained one of the haters of the Linkin Park sound, there will be nothing on this disc to change your mind.  <br />The aforementioned maturity in the songwriting comes primarily from the skill in which they blend their various sonic elements.  The samples are slightly more prominent, although matched perfectly by the chunky guitars, the groove of the rhythm section, and the layered vocals.  Every song is layered so thickly with these combinations, which are so skillfully meshed, that the hooks just come naturally.  As a whole, this album is a bit heavier than Hybrid Theory, and also contains a slightly stronger hip-hop vibe.  <br />Standout tracks like Faint, and Nobodys Listening along with the beautifully crafted Breaking the Habit are what really propels this band beyond the shadow of their first full length.  Hit the Floor is a slow but aggressive hip-hop track with lots of screaming at chorus.  The talent that goes into making every single track on an album worthy of the status of a chart topping single is never lost on Meteora.  In fact, out of the 13 tracks, excluding the intro and the Instrumental Session, all 11 actual songs could be singles.<br />The time and thought that went into this release is apparent in every track, and every page of the insert, covered with artistic photography, notations from the band explaining every single song, and the fold out case concealing the multimedia loaded album is reallysomething to revel at.  Even with as mainstream as this band is, and knowing full well that by the end of the year at least 6 of these songs will be on the radio and MTV every 15 minutes, there are so many bands out that who need to take a lesson from Linkin Park in how far you should go in crafting a masterpiece.  <BR>8/10<br />For Reviews like this and much more, visit bigtouchin.com
B00005JLSE|5.0|I have to say I had doubts going into this movie....musicals aren`t really my thing, and none of the actors really stood out for me, but Chicago was absolutely AMAZING!! It was the best movie I`ve seen in a LONG time! The music, the songs, the dancing, the acting were all something to be remembered. The fact that Zellweger, Jones and Gere did their own singing/dancing only shows how amazingly talented they all are.<BR> Catherine Zeta Jones definitely steals the show in my opinion. Who can not love her as the beautiful, singing, dancing vixen. I applaude the casting...because no one else could have done it better. The Acedemy was right on in their decision to award her with that Oscar! She more then deserves it! Really, I just can`t say enough about her talent, beauty, and overall performance.<BR>  Richard Gere was completely adorable! Who knew he could sing like that? That tapdance blew me away, I couldn`t even believe it was really him doing that. Boy, does he age well or what? Again, this part was perfectly cast. <BR>  Renee Zellweger was great, not as amazing as some of the others, but great. She`s just naturally cute and that`s perfect for the role of Roxie, \\"the sweetest little lady accused of murder\\". Also, I gotta say I love her voice, its very jazzy and sweet.<BR>    And who can forget Queen Latifah! Wow! The only thing I could`ve hoped for was more of her on screen...(she only had one major number).<BR>     Anyway...ABSOLUTELY Amazing, beautifully made, and just plain fun. Even for those who don`t really get into the whole song and dance thing. Add to that the awesome soundtrack with the hilarious \\"Funny Honey\\", \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" and \\"We Both Reached for the Gun\\", sexy and fun \\"Cell Block Tango\\" (one of my favorite) and beautifully sung \\"Nowadays\\"...and you`ve got one great movie!
B0000249ZZ|5.0|This remastered release features both mono and stereo versions of each cut, and the differences are astounding.  Eric Clapton did some his most inspired playing with John Mayall.
B000089RV6|5.0|I'll keep this short &amp; sweet because you all know how great this is, but let me tell you:  it's even better now!  The sound is incredible &amp; the extras make this a must-have, even if you have the '94 remaster.  In a word, UPGRADE!  THE WOLF
B00008GKEG|5.0|The audio is excellent. Various songs from the first four albums are in stereo. The live version of &quot;Revolution&quot; still has Lennon's narration in the middle.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Anybody else reading these reviews think that these folks are just a little too picky?  I mean my gosh, what's not to like?  You get Maiden playing in front of 250,000 people!  It sounds MASSIVE in DTS, it looks incredibly clear &amp; sharp &amp; it's got a great setlist.  I too was impressed with Bruce's versions of &quot;Sign Of The Cross&quot; &amp; &quot;The Clansman&quot;; they sound SO much better with him singing!  Now if we could get them to re-record &quot;Man On The Edge&quot; &amp; &quot;Lord Of The Flies&quot;.  Seems a lot of people on here are trying to review this without the benefit of surround sound which to me would seem to be impossible because you can't possibly experience this without it!  It's LOUD; almost as loud as being there I would think.  Personally, I wouldn't put too much faith in the negative aspects shown in other reviews.  It's awesome &amp; don't let anyone tell you otherwise!  One of the best I own!  The Wolf
B00005AREQ|5.0|Jeff Beck is the only guitarist from the 60's to keep  evolving. His style has changed on every album. This CD features some of his most inspired playing with keyboardist Max Middleton from the Jeff Beck Group II. All the songs are instrumentals ranging from funk to jazz-rock with George Martin's (Beatles, America) excellent production.  You probably won't enjoy this if you think the only great guitar players are speedsters Steve Vai and Joe Satriani.
B00005OWEG|4.0|What can I possibly sat about Apocalype Now that hasn't been said a billion times before, and probably more eloquently than I ever could? Captain Willard's journey upriver into the heart of darkness to &quot;Terminate&quot; the command of the insane Colonel Kurtz is a cinematic legend, and with good reason. The &quot;Redux&quot; version restores some forty-odd minutes to the film, making a Director's Cut that any fan NEEDS to see. I have to say that even though I had seen Apocalypse Now many times before, Redux hammered home a point I had never really considered: In addition to being just a visually gorgeous piece of work, it's also the BIGGEST film I've ever seen. The scope and depth of the film are just amazing, especially considering that everything you're seeing on screen REALLY HAPPENED.....Coppola didn't have the luxury of computer generated graphics in those days. He actually had to stage all of those epic sequences right there in the jungle. The mind boggles....<br />  And that's part of the problem with the DVD.....There are absolutely NO extras, and Apocalype Now is a film that cries out for better treatment. Where is the Coppola commentary track? Interviews with the cast &amp; crew? The legenday documentary &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot; is long out of print and unavailable on DVD...Why not include that? I'm sure that at some point Apocalypse Now Redux will be issued in a &quot;Deluxe&quot; edition, to force fans to buy ANOTHER copy.....If you don't own this already, you'd probably be better off waiting for that.
B000089RVX|5.0|I haven't been moved by a CD in a very long time!  This album incorporates all my favorite things; powerful lyrics, a strong female vocalist &amp; rockin speed metal (on most songs, there are a couple of VERY hot ballads)!<br />This music makes you feel alive!  Enjoy!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Having read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" over and over again for the last 30 years, I am in awe of the production that Peter Jackson has made of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  The \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" was brillent and even though I missed some of the characters that had to be left out, I thought the production was one that Tolkien himself would have approved.  In the \\"Two Towers\\" Peter Jackson has once again captured the feel of the Tolkien trilogy on film.  Even though I thought Aragorn falling off the cliff episode a bit contrived, Jackson has once again given the audience the essence of what Tolkien wrote.  I await the final film, \\"The Return of the King\\" with great anticipation
B00003CXQX|5.0|IF YOU ARE DEBATING ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE, GET IT!! YOU WONT BE SORRY!! <BR>I purchased this movie here at Amazon[.com] for my 2 1/2 year old son. Boy am I glad I did!! A friend of mine was visiting when it arrived in the mail. So we just popped it into the VCR and we were going to chat while my son watched it but WE couldn't keep our attention off the movie!! It was SO cute!! We really just couldn't quit laughing! One of the lightest, funniest films Disney has made. Very entertaining movie and my son just adores it!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is not for everyone. It'd be nice if he was, but he's not. The title of the cd, &quot;Room For Squares&quot;, says it all. This is not a cd for the general superficial people of the world.  The lyrics are introspective for a reason. John Mayer writes his songs himself, about himself. I appreciate the self-involved tone of his music, and as far as guitar playing goes, he's one of the best.  Just because there aren't roaring solos in every song doesn't mean that he's not capable. Try taking in a concert and you'll see.  Room for Squares contains 1 version of some of  his songs.  There are many other songs and many other versions of the songs contained on RFS.  If people realized that some artists do exist before they produce a major-label cd, then they might not be so quick to write off so many artists. Everyone isn't created like the britneys and the avrils.<br />Oh, and anyone who doesn't like 3x5 should not be allowed to listen to this music. YOu obviously don't get it so go back to your Blink-182 and Backstreet Boys and leave this music for those of us who can appreciate it.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This is the first White Stripes recording I've owned, and I like the mix of quirky lyrics, bluesy guitar and garage sound. This is an upbeat album by an interesting duo, but the eight-track recording should be retired, because the sound quality suffers.
B00008I8IF|5.0|Remember the great hooks of the Byrds and the Hollies, and yes, the Beatles. It's back with this exceptional Jayhawks record. The band has merged its alt.country roots with great American pop melody. If you don't know this band, buy this record and you'll end up buying the others before it. I sure hope this album pushes them out front where they deserve to be!
0786868694|4.0|I  approached this cookbook skeptically.  It can be difficult to separate the cooking from the cult of personality, so to critique the recipes is to critique the woman.  The cookbook has lots of chatter and lots of white space, but Nigella Lawson is a charming woman, so the chatter is friendly and companionable, and the book has lots of white space but it is slender and elegant and filled with beautiful photographs of every dish.  Sections are organized as Breakfast, Comfort Food, TV Dinners, Rainy Day, Trashy, etc.  These are more colorful than helpful, but one can find recipes by name or ingredient in the well-constructed index.  No nutritional information is given for the recipes, but that's just as well.<br />I've tried eight recipes so far (and have many more marked to try).  Of those eight, I would say three were resounding successes: the icing for the chocolate fudge cake will be at the top of my list whenever I need an airy but flavorful frosting; the sweet corn pudding was very good; and the double potato and halloumi bake was delicious though I couldn't find the sheep's milk cheese required for two of the book's recipes, even at a gourmet cheese shop.  Two recipes were servable if not very exciting.  And three of the eight recipes did not work for me at all.  My Mozzarella in Carrozza, for example, never resulted in a stretchy warm concoction that I could pull lustily from my teeth, my neck outstretched in voluptuous splendor, though I tried several times.<br />Three additional comments: Several of the recipes I tried benefited from the addition of spice.  Secondly, recipes have been lazily retooled from the metric units originally used, so instructions often call for multiple multi-measurement ingredients -- 1 cup + 2 T flour, 1/4 cup + 1 t sugar, etc etc.  Finally, quite a few recipes call for self-rising flour; you can make the equivalent of 1 cup of self-rising flour by mixing 1 cup of all-purpose flour + 1-1/2 teaspoons of baking powder  + 1/4 teaspoon of salt.<br />Ultimately this is not a flawless effort, but Nigella has the charm and talent to pull off a successful personality cookbook, and though results might be mixed, the good recipes are archetypal. That ain't bad.n of salt.  <br />Ultimately this is not a flawless effort, but Nigella has the charm and talent to pull off a successful personality cookbook, and though results might be mixed, the good recipes are archetypal.

B00005JMCR|5.0|With this being the third and probaly last movie the American Pie Series, I am happy to see the gang once again together.  Even though this is 3 and half months until the release, I must say this movie will rock.  And hopefully be a great movie to make-out to.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This second Harry Potter film is a fine adventure, and this two-disk DVD edition has fun features. Disc One contains the film (you have to purchase widescreen or fullscreen rather than getting both on one disc -- what's up with that?), which can be heard in English or Spanish, or read in English, Spanish or French. The disc also contains a cast and crew listing (which includes neither Moaning Myrtle nor Mr. Weasley!); a theatrical trailer; and an entertaining synopsis trailer of the first film.<br />Disc Two navigates easily and contains a number of good items, including: an enlightening 16-minute conversation with author Rowling and screenwriter Kloves; charming interview snippets from virtually every speaking actor; production sketches; a photo gallery; a 17-minute behind-the-scenes featurette of the production team as they tackle Dumbledore's Office; Lockhart's Classroom, a facsimile replete with certificates, books and pictures all concerning Magical Him; a quiz; an interactive tour of Diagon Alley that lumbers a bit through Navigation Alley but contains clever images; and two games, one getting through the Chamber of Secrets, the other navigating the flying car through the forest -- the latter looks really fabulous. Nineteen additional scenes are available, and they are a lot of fun. I wish several had been used in the theatrical release, including a fine bridge between (a) Hermione's telling Harry he could, indeed, be the heir of Slytherin, and (b) Harry's feeling the curious stares of his housemates; the scene is beautiful -- Harry looking forlornly out over a Lake District-y looking place. I think it's a scene that could easily have been overplayed, but Radcliffe pulled it off nicely.  It convinced me that Radcliffe may grow in the role and benefit from another director.  (I'd love to see Tim Burton tackle an instalment!)  I think all three young leads are better this time around, and of course the entire supporting cast is flawless. Sets and props are inspired, and the effects are breathtaking. Tom Riddle's wordy denouement is less successful on the screen than it was in the book, but therein lies the difference in the mediums.<br />All in all, I'd say this DVD set is lots of fun. The film is very good and the extras are quite entertaining.<br /><br />Caveat: the movie may be too intense for young viewers, people who don't like spiders, or people who don't like snake-ish things.and the effects are breathtaking.

0451207521|5.0|Ok, this was my very first Ken Follett book, and it really just blew me away!! It's one of the best books I have read in a very looong time... <br />Jackdaws consists of an excellent fast moving plot that keeps you rooted to the book from the first page to the last. Follett throws in a couple of plot twists for good measure too. <br />Then there's the matter of the characters themselves, which IMO is the factor that makes or breaks any novel. The characters here were vivid and well fleshed out. Flick Clairet was to me, especially amazing. <br />All the characters were totally unlike the flat undeveloped garbage you get in some books. Here, Follett ensured that they were properly developed into very three-dimensional people. Even the villians had many sides to them. Dieter Franck, the German Officer was one of the best \\"baddies\\" simply because he wasnt completely bad. Follett showed us his human side time and time again till it got to a point where you understood that this man wasnt all evil. You simply could not bring yourself to hate him in the way that other books of this genre might have you detesting the sadistic Nazi officers. He was simply an officer doing his duty the way Flick was doing hers. I actually grew to respect him.<br />An excellent book by anyone's standards. Hopefully we'll see it as a movie one day!
0786867973|5.0|This cookbook has many good recipes, lots of friendly Nigella-chatter, and beautiful photographs of almost every dish. Sections are organized as Cakes, Cookies, Pies (savory and sweet), Desserts, Chocolate, Children, Christmas, Breads and Preserves, and one can also find recipes by name or ingredient in the index. No nutritional information is given.<br />I've tried six recipes so far and have many more earmarked. Of the six I've made, five were quite successful and one was fine but unexciting.  The burnt-butter brown-sugar cupcakes are fabulous; the brownies are perfect examples of the dense, gooey style; the gingerbread with lemon icing and the cranberry upside-down cake were both delicious; and the white bread was a very good big rustic loaf.  The author generously acknowledges her sources in the text and in the bibliography and acknowledgements sections.<br />So far I've thoroughly enjoyed this personality cookbook, really like the recipes I've tried so far, and look forward to trying many more.
B00003CXBK|4.0|i don't know how anyone can NOT like this movie. Made with the most beautiful artistry coupled with an amazing plot, this movie is beyond good. Princess Mononoke is sure to keep you glued to your seat with interest and action. This fast paced japanimation is an artwork and i urge everyone to see it, whether you are in to anime or not.
630341964X|4.0|Some descent light entertainment, and great for kids.<br />This movie stars Macaulay Culkin as Richie Rich. The richest little boy in the world , in this movie adaptation of the famous comic book.<br />We see how he overcomes , with flying colours , his own struggle to make real friends , while defeating the wicked whiles of Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette - 'Night Court'. ) , to save his parents - Richard<br />And Regina Rich played by Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole.<br />Kudos must also go to Jonathan Hyde as Richie's ever-faithful butler, Herbert Cadbury , Micheal McShane as Professor Keenbean , and Stephi Lineburg as little Gloria , who we know from the comic books as Richie's 'girlfriend'.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Folks, \\"Nemesis\\" is little more than a remake of \\"The Wrath of Khan.\\"  Think about it.  A villain from the past (sort of), a weapon of mass destruction, a climactic space battle, and the death (sort of) of a beloved character while saving the Enterprise.<br />Why does Paramount continue to do these movies on the cheap?  Yes, the special effects are spectacular, but the makers continue to compartmentalize Trek movies.  They do it so they don't have to spend a lot of money on sets.  You have the ship, and then you have the various wastelands/wilderness \\"sets\\".  Don't believe me?  Nemesis:  wasteland dune buggy chase.  The Final Frontier:  wasteland \\"Paradise\\" outpost and El Capitan climb.  The Search for Spock:  wasteland planet destroying itself.  Generations:  desert planet for Soran's launch site.  First Contact:  wilderness missile launch site.  ENOUGH!!!<br />Just about everything else in the movies is aboard ship.  Mind you, I don't object to that, per se, but why can't they spend some money on some futuristic sets and try to make at least one epic Star Trek film???<br />As for the movie, Shinzon is adequate as a villain, but I certainly don't believe he would have it in him to wipe out the entire Romulan Senate.  Sorry, that's just too farfetched.  The wedding and B-4 plot diversions are enjoyable, but that's all they are--minor diversions.  The special effects are fabulous, but they should have thought about developing a story that looks beyond CGI.<br />It's not hard to see why this movie was a box-office disappointment.  It also apparently was a disappointment to a great many fans considering some of the reviews here.  <br />Overall, a poor way to end a legendary series of movies.  They should have made a movie to remember rather than one to forget--this movie was as weak as the first one.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I just got Sigur Ros - Untitled. I was told it was better than Agaetis Byrjun, but I didn't think it was possible.<br />This is the best CD I have ever listend too, and I have over a thousand CDs. Their music is amazing. It is unlike anything I have ever heard. Sad, uplifiting, beautiful, foriegn... simply amazing.<br />If you are a fan of music, you must listen at least once.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Obviously the woman from Japan who rated this a less than one star doesn't realize the effect this movie had on kids that grew up around the time it came out. For our generation, this is like sushi is to Japan. You can't take the Goonies away. Sure if I saw this as an adult for the first time I probably wouldn't like it, but considering this was a movie I grew up with and have enjoyed since childhood, it will always remain a 5 star on my list. I bought the DVD so I could watch it again and again. This poor lady's child who hated the movie will grow up very sheltered and when the child hits the streets of Tokyo as a teen and has no clue about anything in life and is a loner, it will be because of things like this where this woman won't let her child hear some mild language when she's probably cussing him out at home every day. DON'T MESS WITH THE GOONIES!
B00008DDXC|4.0|I love the Harry Potter movies (and books) and already have the DVD.  The movie is wonderful and my older child loves it too.  I was however disappointed that the 19 additional/extended scenes were not blended into the theatrical version.  I think that Peter Jackson's &quot;Fellowship of the Ring-Extended version&quot; has set a presidence for future DVD releases.  I would have enjoyed the movie even more with the deleted scenes returned to the movie.  Perhaps that will come later-lets hope!
0156012197|5.0|I have read and reread this book for several years, and I like it better each time. Each time, I discover new insights, bits of wisdom and nuggets of humor. Take it at whatever level you wish...a children's fable or a deep piece of philosophy. You can't go wrong. It makes a great gift, for those who have never read it. They will thank you for introducing them to it.
B000002LND|5.0|When you have as many hits as Madonna, you don't need filler. From \\"Holiday\\", which just gets better as time goes by, to \\"Like A Virgin\\" to \\"Vogue\\" this album sums up the first half of a ground-breaking career. <br />I enjoy the chronological order of the singles. When greatest hits packages randomly lay down tracks you miss the 'arc' of the artist's career.  With this album you can listen every step of the way from the Madonna-lite vocals of \\"Borderline\\" to the womanly-growl of \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Justify My Love\\".<br />And with \\"Justify My Love\\" Madonna proves that a greatest hits album can produce an outright hit single of its own.  She never stops experimenting- even on a career recap. Although many imitations of this song came out in the 90's, Madonna's breathy song-speak was truly fresh at the time.<br />Although the other new track \\"Rescue Me\\" is not on the level of the other songs on this album, it is interesting to note that this same deep voice was once declared \\"minnie mouse on helium\\". <br />A lot of greatest hits packages seem to disappoint- either they are too casual for the die-hard fans, or contain too many obscure tracks for the casual listener.  The brilliant Madonna puts out an album that is must for any fan of her music, or of pop music in general.
B000089CJI|5.0|This band is quite possible the best band I've ever seen. Last night, I saw them perform in Atlanta, and they were phenominal! Not one song on the CD is a \\"skipper\\". For the last few weeks, this band has been on repeat everywhere I go. BUY A COPY NOW!!!!
B00005Q66T|3.0|Although the songs are, of course, superior pop hits, I lowered my rating because this collection is so strangely strung together it is obvious that the brilliant business woman Madonna had nothing to do with it.<br />Why include \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" which is NOT a Madonna song, and leave out \\"You Must Love Me\\", which was an actual single, AND written specifically by Andrew Lloyd Webber for Madonna to sing?  If they were going to include \\"Argentina\\" they should've opted for one of the dance remixes- now THAT would have represented Madonna's ability to make a song her own!<br />I will admit that I am not really upset that there were no new tracks. Whenever artists put new tracks on a greatest hits album you end up with a whole bunch of hits and then 2 or 3...semi-hits. For every \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"You'll See\\"  you get stuck with a \\"Rescue Me\\"  or \\"One More Chance\\"<br />Better to exclude new stuff, if its sub-par to the legacy.
B000000H5K|5.0|&quot;Roots&quot; is by far the most original ever by Sepultura. It sounds nothing like &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, nor does &quot;Against&quot; sound nothing like roots. The reason you can say this is nu metal is because Ross Robinson produced it. Look, every Sepultura album from my experience grows on you. Its something you dont thoroughly enjoy but sooner or later youure gonna find yourself bangin your head to this beautiful piece of art Sepultura blessed us with. It has all the old Sep ingridents, just updated. How can someone not enjoy &quot;Spit&quot; or for the old fans, &quot;Dictatorsh@t&quot;? My favorites are definitely &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, &quot;Breed Apart&quot;, &quot;Straighthate&quot;, F@@k it, every song on this album shreds. Screw all you haters that hate this cd, youre just not open minded.
B000002LGQ|5.0|In her 20 years as the driving force behind most of our pop culture, Madonna has tried her hand at just about everything. With 1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\" she truly fused rock, pop, religion, sex and feminist politics.  Rolling Stone was right to call this as close to art as pop music gets. This album is so cohesive it is best when not viewed as a collection of hit singles (although almost half the tracks were) but as a body of inspired work which is so late-80's, so Madonna, and so pop music, she confidently takes the pop music throne. It is her perfect understanding of the essence of the decade, herself, and the platform that made her a world superstar, which makes this album so unique and so special.  While her early contemporaries like Michael Jackson and Prince lost touch with the public, Madonna came back with this album and with it she produced a hit pop album with more depth than courage than any she has done before or since.<br />Onto the songs.<br />\\"Like a Prayer\\": the most perfect pop single ever produced. Only Madonna would contrive a church choir for back up singers. The guitars rock.  This is a pop-radio revival.<br />\\"Express Yourself\\": Female empowerment never sounded so hot.<br />\\"Love Song\\" a duet with Prince. No one would have bought a real love duet between these two.  So they didn't do one. Instead the lyrics brilliantly declare  'this is not a love song!' Strange. Sexy. Should've been a single.<br />\\"Till death do us part\\"  Again, only Madonna would write a dance track about abuse and a failed marriage. How it works is somehow a mystery- yet this might be the best and most profound track on the album. Other artists wish they had the foresight to make this kind of music.<br />\\"Promise to Try\\" Forget your power ballads, all you Celine Dions and Mariah Careys.  This ballad has more poignancy because of its lack of vocal showiness. Madonna's most perfect ballad of her career.<br />\\"Cherish\\"  The best pop single of the album. She throws back to the girl groups of the past and comes up with platinum. Clever lyrics are never deep, but will hook any listener.<br />\\"Dear Jessie\\"  Who says Madonna doesn't have heart? Bizzarre and childlike, this is another side of endlessly fascinating icon.<br />\\"Oh Father\\" Probably the edgiest ballad ever released to mainstream radio, this wasn't a monster hit, but her vocals have never been better and the arrangement is glorious.  Best video of career as well.<br />\\"Keep it Together\\"  the most underrated dance track of any album, if this had been released earlier as a single it surely would have been a gigantic hit. Again, only Madonna can write a four minute dance track that encapsulates the importance of family ties.<br />\\"Spanish Eyes\\"  Madonna has always flirted with the Spanish culture and with this track she goes beyond the earlier ballad 'La Isla Bonita' to produce a song of love, loss and longing.<br />\\"Act of Contrition\\" Not a song really.  A tongue in cheek repentance for everything we just heard.  The perfect punctuation for a pivotal album. Let the 80's end. A new decade is upon us..girl groups of the past and comes up with platinum.

B000003TA4|5.0|really, i see two bad reviews of this fantastic cd, and it pains me to say that some dont like (in my opinion), one of the best bands of all time.  i think somebody was just trying to bring the average rating down to anger us all, poor poor souls.  just admit that it was one of the greatest albums of all time.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  It took listening to it a few times before it really clicked, but after that point I haven't been able to stop listening to it.  Even after owning it for a couple months I still play it daily.  It is something new and unique.  A great CD!
B000002J1B|4.0|After masterminding one of the most potent examples of prog-rock excess (1973's Tales From Topographic Oceans), YES pull back the reins and format their follow-up, Relayer, after their classic Close To the Edge disc; one side-long piece (for you vinyl folks) with two 'shorter' tracks on side two. And once again, the format works.<BR>YES proved with this album that it isn't the length of the tracks that made Tales so difficult to swallow; it was the rambling, noodling meandering arrangements. The Gates Of Delirium, clocking in at nearly 22 minutes, showed the band's ability to utilize the space given to say what needed to be said and do so in a way that was exciting, vital, and interesting.<BR>The track starts off as a sort of mid-tempo tune (with vocalist Jon Anderson's lyrics, based on the book War and Peace-- remember, this is prog rock!) and there are moments you could swear Kansas ripped off.<BR>Then the track takes off into more aggressive territory, building into an orgy of musical chaos reminiscent of the wild, weird opening section of Close To the Edge, only here the band sounds tougher, more angular, more quirky, with flashes of King Crimson-type bombastics. <BR>When the listener feels they cannot bear it anymore, the group pulls it all back into focus, and kicks into one of the grooviest moments on a YES disc. Drummer Alan White and bassist Chris Squire lock in and don't let go as guitarist Steve Howe fleetingly jams in his unique style over them. Underpinning the whole thing, and laying out an unassuming palatte of soundscapes is new recruit Patrick Moraz. Moraz proves less flashy than veteran keys-man Rick Wakeman, but no less formidable.<BR>The track then changes direction once again, and dissolves into a gorgeous mini 'song within a song', the so-called \\"Soon\\" section. The simple beauty of the melody and music counterbalances the complexities of what had proceeded it, and takes the listener into a state of sonic bliss. <BR>The remainder of the album continues first with the 'we-can-play-faster-than-you-and-just-to-prove-it-we-will' wackiness of Sound Chaser. One is both struck with awe by the band's quickness -- and also numbed by it. It has to be heard atleast once, which is probably more than the most die-hard fan can handle.<BR>Then the album closes with To Be Over, featuring great pedal steel from Steve Howe. The track has a sort of pensive quality, a lilting gentleness to it that builds to a comfortable climax. A fitting end to an exceptional disc. <BR>If you are not a YES fan, this is not really the place to start; stick with Fragile or 90125. But for die-hards, this is a tough one to beat. Great album.
B00008BXJF|5.0|King Crimson has always made a point of being deliberately different and always on the cutting edge. This album is no exception. Where else can a master guitar player (Fripp) make his instrument also sound like a mellotron, a violin or a synthesizer?<br />The motif of the album is in the four short versions of \\"The Power To Believe\\". The first is meek and sweet with Eastern percussion while the last concludes the session with Fripp's guitar soaring like a solo violin and a whole variety is in between. \\"Level Five\\" displays the tight, almost violently aggressive sound King Crimson has nearly patented. It's a great opener.<br />Of course, there are plenty of great prog-rock songs such as \\"Eyes Wide Open\\", a harken back to \\"Three Of A Perfect Pair\\" and \\"Facts Of Life\\" with cynical lyrics that made fun of the rich and greedy (\\"six millionaires crawling on a plate\\") and immorality (\\"just because you can doesn't mean you should\\").<br />'Newbie boy bands' get skewered on \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\", with lyrics like, \\"I'm gonna have to write a chorus, We're gonna need to have another chorus...\\". It's nicely vicious. Not all is parody, as is shown with a great progressive build of a song with an urgent crescendo in \\"Dangerous Curves\\".<br />Adrian Belew is obviously having a good time and is a great compliment to Fripp's guitar work. Trey Gunn is amazing with all his bass instruments and Pat Mastelotto is extremely confident. Mastelotto may not have the flash that Bill Bruford displays, but his competency and pinpoint accuracy more than makes up for it. This 'King Crimson' grouping is just as tight as any and it's great to hear more innovative and fascinating mixes of talent and instruments thirty years on.
B000001ESP|5.0|Yeah, Rush made great music before 1981, and they would continue to do so after, but that year was THE year for Rush, the much-maligned Canadian prog-rock trio. They managed to create an album that was both truly progressive and truly listenable. With Moving Pictures, they hooked the mainstream, and suddenly the band had fans all over the place.<BR>You can thank, firstly, great songs. The quirky musicians, known for their ability to play circles around anyone else in rock and doing so over super-complex arrangements, wrote some interesting, compelling tunes for this album. Tom Sawyer, Limelight, and Red Barchetta were all hits of varying degree and they showcase a cohesive melding of prog-rock leanings with mainstream rock sensibility; they knew when to pull in the reins, and when to cut loose. Tom Sawyer features a memorable synth line (provided by vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee) and mindblowing drumwork (by Neil Peart). Limelight is guitarist Alex Lifeson's showcase. The main riff is great, and so is Lifeson's sublime solo, played with power and finesse.<BR>The instrumental, YYZ, swings like mad, slowing down only once for listener's to catch their breath before slinging right back into the track. Lee's bass playing is phenomenal, but not overwhelming.<BR>Of course, being a prog-rock band, they have an 'epic' piece here, in the form of The Camera Eye. The track is interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying when stacked against the rest of the disc. Witch Hunt (subtitled 'part 3 of FEAR' -- fans would have to wait to figure that out later) is a strong track with a sort of cinematic sweep to its execution. The album closes with Vital Signs, which sounds more like a song by The Police than Rush. The techno-reggae vibe was (at the time) cutting edge and was a hint at things to come from this impressive band.<BR>Secondly, you can thank the production. The sound of this disc is still amazing. It has to be heard on a good sound system to fully appreciate the nuances of each composition. <BR>Rush had come a long way from those sweaty bars in Toronto playing Led-Zeppelin-esque hard rock. With Moving Pictures, Rush had cemented their own place in rock and roll, with their own distinctive style. If you thought Permanent Waves was good, check this out. This one is a keeper.
0385504209|5.0|Okay, this was the first Dan Brown book I've read and it was nothing short of EXCELLENT. The writing is fresh and doesn't waste time wwith lagging descriptions; the observations made of interesting and give you a good scope of the characters and settings.<br />Robert Langdon, a symbology professor at Harvard, finds himself mixed-up in the case of the murder of the famous currator of the Louvre. Accompanied by the victim's clever granddaughter, Sophie Nevue, the two make their escape from Paris, on a mysterious scavenger hunt linked to the Priory of Sion, an ancient organization that protects the Holy Grail from the Vatican Church. Sophie, who had not spoken to her grandfather in a decade because of a Sion rite that she had witnessed, starts to realize the truth about her family.<br />Her grandfather's murderer, an agent of the Opus Dei, a strictly conservative Catholic organization, continues to chase them through Europe, alongside Parisian police.<br />A spicy work; Dan Brown shows enormous prowess at his trade. I loved all the history interwined with the plot and the fascinating conspiracy of Christ's questionable divinity. This the laugh, sit-on-the-edge of your chair, and make-you-think type of book. Top notch adventure and a twist of romance. Perfect.<br />-Liaden
0783231032|4.0|I have to admit; I love 1941.  There's some insane part of me that gets a cheap thrill from watching Hollywood Boulevard being destroyed by a bunch of total morons.  1941 may not be a great movie, but then again, no one was expecting it to be GONE WITH THE WIND.  It's just an insane comedy that I happen to love.<br />The film has several different plots, all of which come crashing together during the last hour and a half of the movie.  The Japanese, parked off the coast of California in a large Japanese submarine, make plans to blow up Hollywood.  They are led by Japanese commander Commander Mitamura (played by Toshiro Mifune) and Nazi Captain Vonkleinschmidt (played by Christopher Lee).  Back on land, Wally (Bobby DiCicco), aided by best friend Dennis (Perry Lang), hopes to win the jitterbug contest with Betty Douglas (Diane Kay), who is chased around by serviceman Chuck \\"Stretch\\" Sitarski (Treat Williams).  Betty's friend Maxine (Wendy Jo Sperber) lusts after Sitarski, and Betty's father Ward (Ned Beatty) recieves an anti-aircraft gun that bears a striking resemblance to an army tank.  Meanwhile, General's aide Loumis Birkhead (Tim Matheson) lusts after Donna Stratton (Nancy Allen), who is turned on by planes.  And bursting through all of this is loud and crude nutcase pilot Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi) who makes it his business to blow everything up.<br />The first hour or so is far more calm than the last hour and a half.  During this, writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (who went on to do BACK TO THE FUTURE) set up all the characters and plot lines, not all of which I have mentioned yet.  The gags are slowly milked out to their fullest extent, and Slim Pickens has a funny role as a drunk captured by the Japanese  The last hour and a half, however, is a blast in the face of music, sound and imagry.  There's lots to see here; a ferris wheel rolling off a peir, with two guys (Murray Hamilton, Eddie Deezen and Deezen's wooden dummy) on top of it; Beatty's wife Lorraine Gary watching in horror as he drives a tank through their home; and, of course, Kelso and all the others blowing up half of Hollywood Boulevard while General Stillwell (Robert Stack) watches DUMBO in the local theatre.<br />The music by John Williams is unforgettable, hummable and, as usual, absolutely perfect.  The visual effects are amazing for their time, and even more amazing when you consider the fact that they're better than most of today's computer effects.  All the technichal elements in the film are superb.<br />Will you like this movie?  I don't know.  I did, but then again, my sense of humor isn't exactly sophisticated.  I thought 1941 was crazy fun, but don't see it if you have weak ears, and if you have the volume on high, brace yourself.  The last hour and a half is basically people screaming and stuff blowing up, and it's LOUD.  But I still found 1941 to be, in a goofy way, loud and insane fun.<br />The DVD is great.  There's an excellent 110 minute documentary on the making of the film, and no wonder it's excellent; it was directed by documentary maker extraordinaire Laurent Bozereau.  By the way, the cut on the disc is an extended cut that has about 26 minutes of extra footage.  I don't remember the original version well enough to comment on the difference however.  Also included are excellent production notes, great photo galleries, three fun trailers (the first of which has specially prepared footage), original reviews (which are, for the most part, really, really nasty), and some interesting deleted scenes.  Also, Universal has graciously cut the movie up into 60 (!) different chapters.  Talk about packaging!<br />It may not be a classic, and it may not really be about anything besides stuff getting destroyed, but 1941 is still VERY, VERY FUNNY.  I recommend it both for the movie and this EXCELLENT DVD.

B000084T18|4.0|I like 50 Cent, but this CD got kind of old after a while. I mean, it's still tight, but Wanksta and In The Club aren't the best songs on here anymore. I like What Up Gangsta, Patiently Waiting, If I Can't, Don't Push Me, and 21 Questions. It's a pretty good CD, though.
B000089RVX|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  This is one of the best groups to hit the music industry in years.<br />Try to imagine if Tori Amos was the lead singer for a kickin' rock band like Linkin Park and you might get some idea of what to expect from Evanescence.<br />Some songs are mellow while others really rock, but all of them are very moving and full of emotion.  Get it - you won't be disappointed.

0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has cracked the code on writing an exhiliarating thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Amazing detail and everything you want in a page turner! Also highly recommend THE GRAVEL DRIVE by Kirk Martin - another page turner that's less of a thriller than an emotional story about a father and son, but one you won't forget. Can't wait for Dan Brown's next one!
B000075BFK|4.0|2Pac's latest CD, Better Dayz is off the chain! It has songs like Thugs Mansion, Thugs Mansion (Nas Acoustic), and Better Dayz. This CD is just as good as Nas's God's Son, maybe even better.
B000084T18|4.0|2. What Up Gangsta-thumbs up<BR>3. Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem)-thumbs in the middle  <BR>4. Many Men (Wish Death)-thumbs up  <BR>5. In Da Club-thumbs down  <BR>6. High All the Time-thumbs down        <BR>7. Heat-thumbs up        <BR>8. If I Can't-thumbs up        <BR>9. Blood Hound (feat. Young Buck of G Unit)-thumbs up        <BR>10. Back Down-thumbs up        <BR>11. P.I.M.P.-thumbs way down, horrible track        <BR>12. Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit)-thumbs down        <BR>13. Poor Lil Rich-thumbs down        <BR>14. 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg)-thumbs up        <BR>15. Don't Push Me (feat. Lloyd Banks of G Unit & Eminem)-thumbs in the middle        <BR>16. Gotta Make It to Heaven-thumbs in the middle<br />As you can see the strength is in the middle, basically between tracks 7-10, all of those are blazin' probably the 4 best on the CD. Many Men is a great song also but I'm not feeling the catchy, pop-music In Da Club espically the dull beat. And tracks 11-13 are horrible. They were clearly filler songs.<br />50 Cent puts out a good effort, he has some great songs but needs to put out a better all around effort like his classic Guess Who's Back, which is better than this fo sure. 50 isn't Tupac. Tupac is a sophisticated thug who talked about various things from teen pregnecy to friends and foes. He is in a class of his own. 50 is just a thug rapper, but is a damn good one at that. <br />Recommanded, but don't expect Illmatic, Ready To Die, or The Chronic.

B00006RIO7|5.0|Before I begin, let me say that I loved the movie, Chicago. So if you didn't like the movie, you probably won't like the soundtrack.<br />1. Overture/And All That Jazz<br />The definitive Chicago song. It starts with an awesome instrumental bit and then Catherine Zeta-Jones joins in after a couple of minutes. This is the kind of song that will get in your head and never come out. A very fun track.<br />2. Funny Honey<br />Renée Zellweger's singing; you'll either love it or hate it, and that goes the same with this track. A great song with piano music.<br />3. When You're Good to Mama<br />This song shocked a whole bunch of people, because nobody knew that Queen Latifah could sing. And sing very well, at that. A catchy background instrumental bit complete with fun lyrics make this a great song.<br />4. Cell Block Tango<br />Many people's favorite song, and for good reason. Tons of energy in this one. I haven't met a single person who didn't like it. I even showed it to a kid who didn't want to see Chicago and now he wants to see Chicago!<br />5. All I Care About<br />Richard Gere's first song on the CD. One of my favorites. I love the climax near the end.<br />6. We Both Reached For The Gun<br />A great song. Starring Richard Gere as himself AND Roxie. Very, very fun to listen to.<br />7. Roxie<br />Same as Funny Honey. I love this song as well. Also gets stuck in your head.<br />8. I Can't Do It Alone<br />Mostly instrumental, except for a few &quot;First I..., Then She..., Then We...&quot; I challange you to find a person who doesn't like this one.<br />9. Mister Cellophane<br />If you thought that I was just going to say good things about the CD, then here's the part where I complain. Mister Cellophane isn't very fun to listen to at all. It's not John C. Rielly's fault, his singing it great, it's just that the song's seems to move lazily. I often skip this one.<br />10. Razzle Dazzle<br />One of the best songs on the CD. Richard Gere sings along with a few girls.It gets really energetic at the end, but it helps if you've seen the movie first.<br />11. Class<br />This is my favorite song on the CD. The lyrics are great and understandable. It's sung by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah and couldn't be done better. Definatly worth a listen.<br />12. Nowadays (Roxie)<br />Roxie sings Nowadays, a great song that sticks with you. Starts with a large instrumental background, but then trasistions to a piano background. Very cool.<br />13. Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag<br />Same as the last one, but sung by Renée and Catherine. Halfway through, they switch to just instrumental. I love it, but I would rather just listen to the movie, because the sound effects enhance it a whole bunch.<br />14. I Move On<br />Oscar Nominated and for good reason. The song that played during the credits that many people might have missed.<br />15. After Midnight<br />Instrumenal bit that was played durring the Kitty part in the movie. Very fun to listen to.<br />16. Roxie's Suite<br />Also instrumental. It has a &quot;busy city&quot; feeling and is always energetic.<br />17. Cell Block Tango (He Had It Comin')<br />And now for something completely different... I don't think this song will hold very well with the target audience of the movie. It's this crazy ghetto rap bit that takes a bit from the Cell Block Tango scene from the movie. The best I can say is that it's good a &quot;head bobbin' beat&quot;<br />18. Love is a Crime<br />Same as the last song, not really my cup of tea. The only way it seems to be related to the movie is that the singer randomly shouts &quot;Chicago&quot;. This is a song to boot.<br />Overall, a very awesome CD. I've been listening to it since January.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a must see.  Confusing at first but shot brilliantly. Donnie Darko is played amazingly by Jake Gyllenhaal, who really brought the character to life with a deep meaning, he has a gift to make you think about the truth of the story, it really touched me. The writer and first time director have amzing minds.  And a big thanks to Drew Barrymore for making it possible. twisted and surreal yet with all the truths of teenage angst,  it is now one of my favorate films and i recommend it to all.<BR>(Frank the six foot rabbit is a touch of genius, that six foot demonic rabbit is the high light of the film!)
B000088E6D|1.0|Sure! With enough promotion he will sell some CD's but there is<BR>much lacking in these performances such as musicality, phrasing,<BR>feeling and other nuances that you find in a Nat Cole performance. What's left here is an empty suit or rather, an<BR>empty voice. Why waste money on this CD when you can buy the<BR>real thing by Cole or Sinatra that will give you pleaure forever...
B000002HAF|5.0|Some say Doolittle - but in my opinion, this is the Pixies best album. This album started the &quot;Steve Albini&quot; craze which was put to good use with Nirvana's &quot;In Utero&quot; and stolen by Weezer on &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, and with good reason, Albini gives this record so much personality, every time I listen to it, it's like talking to an old friend. Joey Santiago's guitar TALKS, and not in a Frampton way. Imagine the Spider-Man villian &quot;Carnage&quot; as a lead guitar. That is Santiago's sound. I sometimes wonder if his guitar is possessed, it sounds as if Santiago has no idea what is going on, I imagine the guitar hovering in the air being played by psychotic, invisible hands. In addition, Lovering's drums are so up and in your face that if you played this on a good stereo, the people in the next room might think you're actually playing drums. Deal's voice is beautiful, her background vocals are excellent. Don't ask what the best songs on this are, they're all classics, but if you must know, my personal favorites are &quot;Where is My Mind?&quot;, &quot;Gigantic&quot; and &quot;Cactus&quot;, but they change daily. This is the best album of one of the greatest and most original bands of all time. As much as I love Nirvana, this leaves &quot;In Utero&quot; and &quot;Nevermind&quot; looking like Raffi. You're only hurting yourself if you don't buy this right now.
