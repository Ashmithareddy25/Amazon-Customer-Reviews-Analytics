B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple but Fun basic solitaire game!  Have experienced no problems with this app, which is how all apps should be!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Ambivalent about dl'ing the app because I find it impossible to scroll thru my \\"collections\\" on the kindle fire. Kind of negates the fun of pinterest.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack used to be my top iOS game, and I was sad when I got my Android device that it wasn't available. It's a fantastic game that's easy to pick up and play, but should last for many hours. The only issue I have with it is its high CPU and RAM usage. I used to play this game on an iPod touch with a 600MHz proc and 128gb of RAM, and despite being a battery hog, it wasn't choppy. On android, I have to clear all un-essential programs from RAM before playing. Granted, I have a lower-end device, but it's specs are almost double that of the old iPod. I hope to see better porting by the time it reaches Play, but it is still a great game.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|recieved my order very quickly and eagerly watched it!  no problems with either of the 2 Blu-Ray discs in this edition.  the extra disc was very good!  i like how you can understand why the director, & powers that be for the movie, made choices to do the movie as they did - helpful for those with doubts that it's not exactly the same as the book and it can't be as good.  the actor/character section was good as well - plenty of good extras and reasons why some people got the parts, what they brought to the parts, their enthusiasm, etc.  i thought this movie was a very good representation of the book and a better adaptation than the Twilight series (and yes, i am a fan of that series but feel this one was done a little more seriously).  a few things were obviously changed due to time constraints; but that's the usual for book adaptations.  most books are not written to be movies so there are situations that could make it difficult to play out on the big screen.<br /><br />the only complaint i have is that there are no deleted scenes or flub reels on this edition - but i'm not sure if there are any on the other editions.  the director may have opted not to do that.<br /><br />may the odds ever be in your favor!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|while reading the book i felt the filthy language was so unnecessary.  the plot was good but unbelievable.  worst ending to a book i have read in a long time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was pleasurable. Reading it more than once was better each time. It helped me purchase new items to enhance our lives.
0545265355|5.0|We were behind in reading this series and saw the movie first.  My daughter, followed by me and my husband began reading the trilogy afterwards and well all loved it.  My daughter loved the first one best, but my husband and I equally enjoyed all three of the stories.  There is so much detail in them and once you grasp what a world such as what these people live in may be like it really helps the imagination take over to absorb the stories.  I also like the fact that Katniss is such an interesting hero on so many levels.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Beloved adventure story, classic cast...this is Old Hollywood at it's best.  Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland are the perfect combination for Robin and Marion in this fun family-friendly film.  Amazon delivered a great movie at an extraordinary price!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like the game and its fun but I don't know how to be the the zombies but its still a good game
142212312X|4.0|My title sounds paradoxical.  What I learned from Mr. Drucker's pamplet is that we all must be responsible for our career paths.  Instead of seeing ourselves as employee for ABC, Inc., we should focus on gaining skills, and most importantly, know who we are as individuals.  Too many people today let other people dictate what they should do in their careers.  Is it any wonder we see people \\"going postal\\" at their jobs.  Just look at what happened in New York City on Friday.  A man hunts down his former employer and shoots him dead!?!?!<br /><br />Granted situations like Friday's murder are rare.  But I believe if people would see themselves as independent contractors, they wouldn't see their employers as an extention of mommy or daddy.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes was an wonderful cozy that I devoured in one sitting.  Denise Grover Swank has made a new fan!  Both books were fast-paced, easy to read and interesting. I have actually caught myself saying \\"crappy doodles\\" every now and then since reading the books

B0086700CM|5.0|I love it so much! it's a great game! it is so fun to play. I would totally recommend it!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie was great! I can't wait for the second one to come out. i can't compare the movie and the book cause i haven't read the book yet but the movie was awesome!
B006LSZECO|4.0|it's not great literature, keeps one reading and reading until you see where the characters are going. Not the ending I would have liked but it is consistent with all the plot twists and turns.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I don't rate apps often, but I just had to say how great this app is. The graphics are great, the missions keep it fun and interesting. It's challenging but not too hard. I even love the music. Caution: you may find yourself playing it in the middle of the night.<br />FYI: playing on the Toshiba Thrive
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This program works great on my kindle fire. The audio pronunciation feature is great. The favorites featire is great too. Two complaints:<br />1. No pronunciation feature for word of the day.<br />2. No save to favorites feature for word of the day.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is one of those &quot;how far can you go&quot; games, complete with powerups--both expendable and persistent--though the latter type must be equipped and you're limited to using two at a time. Like many games in this genre, there's a long list of &quot;missions&quot; you can complete in order to advance in rank and earn bonus coins in the process. If you're impatient and/or lazy, you can purchase coins with real money, but thankfully it's not necessary to do this to (eventually) unlock everything. One unique feature this game offers is a slot machine spin at the end of the game with interesting prizes.<br /><br />It is fun, and the combinations of  innovative powerups and missions keep the replay value higher than most games in this genre. The outfits are also amusing...For instance, you can make Barry look like a Super Saiyan, complete with scouter (it's a powerup).<br /><br />I did notice three things that gave me pause though. First, there's a &quot;leaderboards&quot; section (which it says is coming soon). I sincerely hope the developers read these reviews; if they do, they should realize by now that unless the game is MMO by nature,WE DON'T LIKE LEADERBOARDS (particularly OpenFeint). So with any luck, this &quot;feature&quot; will remain absent.<br /><br />Second, and not to sound like a hater, but there is a reason many of us choose Android over iOS for our mobile devices, and it's not (just) price. Android has features iOS does not (and may never have) that give users more control over applications. One such feature is the omnipresent BACK and MENU buttons, the Android equivalent of Esc and right-click, respectively. Apple poo poos then very notion of using more than a single mouse button or the keyboard to do anything useful on Macs; not surprisingly, iOS devices have but a single button (home), and it is completely independent of apps. That's fine and well, actually. To each his own. But here at Android, when I press BACK in an application, I expect itto do something, even if the iOS style back button isn't visible at the time.<br /><br />Third, though iOS does have the home button, it's understood to be more like a start button than an exit button, where apps continue running indefinitely. On Android, interpretation of the home button is left to the developers, but it is well understood that either BACK or HOME should be associated with exiting the app, and when we Android users find the the only way to terminate an app is to kill the process, we get very annoyed. This should be fixed.<br /><br />In summary, I do not begrudge the developers for having to jump through Apple's hoops before deciding to port this otherwise fine game here. But Android is not only a different API and app store(s). It's a different culture, too.
034580404X|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I am currently on Volume 1.  It is very interesting and has held my attention for more.......  so far, I love reading it.....
B007STBUIW|5.0|This movie looks looks great and still is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It actually blows me away this movie is almost 40 years old. They did a great job restoring it and making it worth the purchase for BR.  Not only that, but it has the documentary on Jaws that I've been trying to find for awhile to watch called \\"The Shark is Still Working\\", which was a good watch in its own right.  5 out of 5.<br /><br />Finally, I have recently bought 2 movies, I think both from Universal, that do the whole flixter/digital copy/itunes thing correctly.  Give us a choice of how to download the digital copy we paid for.  Bravo Universal!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|bought this app about 3 days ago and have been addicted. I have not had any problems with it on my kindle fire. super fun!
B008XG1X18|5.0|so glad they finally created an android app! I now can pin till my heart's content on my phone and kindle!!
B0056BMK6K|1.0|From the \\"The Best Book Reviews Money Can Buy\\", NY Times, August 26th, 2012:<br /><br />One thing that made a difference is not mentioned in \\"How I Sold One Million E-Books.\\" That October, Mr. Locke commissioned Mr. Rutherford to order reviews for him, becoming one of the fledgling service's best customers. \\"I will start with 50 for $1,000, and if it works and if you feel you have enough readers available, I would be glad to order many more,\\" he wrote in an Oct. 13 e-mail to Mr. Rutherford. \\"I'm ready to roll.\\"<br /><br />...<br /><br />In a phone interview from his office in Louisville, Ky., Mr. Locke confirmed the transaction. \\"I wouldn't hesitate to buy reviews from people that were honest,\\" he said.<br /><br />I bought this book, which goes on about the basics of internet and social media marketing. I applauded Mr Locke for his honest blog posts about his own likes and dislikes- instead of talking about writing and selling books, as many writers are wont to do with their blogs. But he left out how he gamed Amazon's algorithms by buying reviews from a paid review site, which no doubt shot his books up the rankings.<br /><br />I bought this not expecting to make a million, but to learn tried and true methods for marketing without becoming a bullhorn of self-promotion. Instead, it looks like he took advantage of a system that Amazon has since patched. I should have known when his fiction was 99 cents and this was $5 that I was being played for a sucker.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun game. tons of quick games to play. very addicting especially when you find one that is hard to beat and you just have to keep playing until you beat it. like having point goals to be able to unlock new games.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|used to play version 2 then bought this one several months ago for the kindle fire. I have completed it 3 times and try to play other games but keep coming back to this one. excellent graphics, two difficulty modes, and fun and difficulty increase as the game goes on. highly recommend!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|amazing game<br />the graphics are ridiculously great and just the point that you can run over zombies is great and the power ups and stiff are great
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has a lot its fun and cool.  keep up the good work.  and bring more games to play

030758836X|4.0|*****MINOR SPOILER*******<br /><br />OK, here we go. I can only compare my experience reading Gone Girl to a roller coaster ride at SixFlags.  It was, in general, enjoyable and certainty better than average. The slow build was unsettling in a good way and I couldn't wait to turn the page. Like waiting in line for the aforementioned coaster: You see the track and it looks fun. Some people that get off the ride loved it. They're grinning ear to ear and talking about how much they liked the entire ride. Other people getting off don't seem so thrilled but you can see the first giant hill from where you stand in line and it looks like the kind of hill you LOVE! Yay! Then you're in the cart and being pulled up to the very top so you're excited and breathless as you climb higher and higher. Now the top is within sight and you can't wait for the rush of flying all the way back down. The cart stops for a split second at the peak, and you can now see not just the immediate drop, but all these unexpected twists and loops! This roller coaster is going to be freaking better than you expected!!! You hold on to the bar, excitement building as your cart begins speeding down the hill-SO MUCH FUN-you can see those twists and loops getting closer, coming faster (omg, its going to be awesome !) Now the loop is before you and your heart is beating out of your chest. You have your mouth opened to let the inevitable shriek of joy escape. Every fiber in you body is anticipating the pleasure and terror that twisted loop is sure to bring you. I mean, the ride has been better and faster than any of your expectations thus far. It can only get better with each loop! Here you go, you're 3 seconds from the loop and all the fun its sure to bring! You can't breath, you can feel your heart pounding.....here you go!!!! And then.....and then..........
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Classic Joe Bonamassa. My favorites are \\"Heavenly Soul\\" and the \\"Too Much Ain't Enough Love\\" cover. I'd have to say this is some of his most involved song writing to date. Good stuff!
B000026OHN|5.0|If you're looking at this album, then you already know what to expect. It is amazing and there are about four hours of it. An excellent buy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting. Once you start playing it you just want to keep on completing each level. It does get frustrating but it is still a very fun game.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|This is just plain old great down and dirty blues music. Johnny still has the soul, voice and love of what he plays and it comes through in spades. A must have for any blues lover or fan of Johnny Winter.

B0063GORYU|4.0|I really like this game!Easy to figure out without help. Great way to pass the time. Would recommend!  like this one the best. have downloaded several &amp;got rid of the other ones.
B003102JDM|4.0|If you think this is a yet another movie about problems, solutions and happy ending, then this is not a movie you will enjoy. But this is a beautiful movie that portrays life in its most realistic 'humors'. The story revolves around Larry Gopnik, whose life is a string of events, either unfair or confusing. In search of answers to the problems, he sees rabbis in his community, hoping some enlightenments. But there is never an easy answer and some problems even seem to have no answers at all. People deal with their problems in their own way. The junior rabbi Scott suggests it is a matter of seeing things. Rabbi Nachter contends there doesn't have to be answers. The most senior rabbi Marshak seems to be still struggling with his own lifetime quest for truth.<br />If anything to be learned from this movie: life is full of problems, each of which needs a different answer. Some has a simple answer, some goes away with time, some needs compromise with our principles and some really has no answer.<br /><br />If you're a serious man, then maybe you can relate so much with Larry and this movie is definitely for you.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I'm halfway through this first novel in the trilogy and I am quite impressed with the quality of the imaginative writing.  The reader needs to appreciate the world of science fiction fantasy and will enjoy the ride.
0066620996|5.0|Book is in good condition as promised.  This book was recommended to me by several colleagues, so I thought I would give it a read.  Prompt delivery and good condition.
B0051OZ564|1.0|I watched this Dreadful, Hideous, movie only because Scott Glenn, John  Hamm and Carla Gugino were in it.<br /><br />They should be ashamed for being part of a movie so bad that even the 16 year old boys that it was apparently made for would HATE it.<br /><br />I can't believe that this movie was ever produced.<br />What a mess!
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Forget Borat, Ali G and Bruno. Here comes Sasha Baron Cohen in his most recent role Aladeen, The Dictator. I think this is the funniest movie Sasha Baron Cohen has ever starred in. Some jokes may be crude, downright racist and stereotypical, but we already expect that with a Sasha Baron's movie. A very clever politically-incorrect satire, funny from start to end, full of funny dialogs with world politic references.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Aladeen makes his speech in the UN about dictatorship (or is it American politics he is describing?):<br />\\"Why are you guys so anti dictators. Imagine if America is a dictatorship. You could let 1% of the people to have all the nation's wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes and bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health and education. Your media would appear free but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. You could wiretap phones. You could torture foreign prisoners. You could have rigged elections. You could lie about why you go to war. You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group and no one will complain. You could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests. I know this is hard for americans to imagine, but please try!\\"<br /><br />I really love this movie, however, some people might find it too crass. But for me, it's a five-star.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very detailed and entertaining! The author keeps drawing you in with some new twist or more insight into the characters.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Excellent read, as I said best fantasy read since Game of Thrones!!!!  Outstanding story, and characters with twists you will not see coming.  I am an avid SF/fantasy reader and was blown away by this book. Only problem is book 2 is not going to be released for a while.....(after print release of book 1).
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am so happy I stumbled across this book.  This is simply put the finest debut I've read since Name of the Wind.  Beyond that, however, the characterizations are far sharper than in Rothfuss' books.  Sure, Ryan may lack some of Rothfuss' skill with wording, but that's a small sin.  I understand the book is to be published by a traditional publisher.<br />I hope the publisher is wise enough to to tread too much on what is already a fantastic novel.  And yes, though I own the epub format, I plan on buying the physical novel as well.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Has everything you could possibly thank of when it comes to photo editing!  Perfect to use when uploading pictures to Facebook, with the ability to edit and customize your photos before you POST for the WORLD to SEE!

B0068LYEHA|3.0|Heard her on Fresh Air, NPR w/Terry Gross and really wanted to read the book.  As an old feminist -- I can like much of what she says -- but other parts of the book are imo, just tmi.  There is an unnecessary crudeness - her points could be made, funny, really funny with a little less vulgarity.  It just seemed out of place somehow -- in person (on the radio) she is delightful.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|The Good:<br /><br />1) Great alien special effects, except for the sit down chairs when viewing a certain movie thing, made in China folding chairs for a \\"trillion dollar\\" project? I guess they ran out of money or the president got stingy or had a whatever moment. The holograms also made no sense, what was with the shitty quality of the alien holograms? That made noooo sense.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />1-2) Already mentioned two<br />3) So, in the year 2093, we or the Weyland Corp. is still using rockets? Huuuuuuh? I don't think so. And even the vehicles were still rolling around. Come on, not even hovercraft let alone ground air effect? If ur spending millions on a movie, at least spend a hundred thou on some actual modern day advanced vehicles, but cars? Boring. And they didn't even make much of the inside of the large transport vehicle, at least show off some fancy gadgetry in the thing, like talking vehicles would be nice, or an infrared display toggle or ground penetrating radar undernetah or something high tech! BUT, what the: The laser mapping balls conveniently have antigravity? SO THE LITTLE BALLS GET TO ROAM AROUND GRAVITY FREE, JUST NOT THE MORE IMPORTANT HUMANS WHO MADE THEM! Lame!<br /><br />4) So they finally get to the new miracle planet, and all these people can do is be lame? Captain lady: \\"I love my isolated life pod, love sitting in this chair, just gonna stay in here while we're finally after years arriving to a planet, and one where supposedly our makers live, and I'm gonna be arrogant about it to the top scientists on board too.\\" Narcissist? What was with the male scientist's bluh attitude? So, he gets back after looking at an alien installation, and then is playing pool alone, is depressed, and, is depressed, yawn. Why isn't he going over the maps of the place and all hyper and excited like those loser computer nerds at NASA during their Mars NWO Gay Pardadiousity landing? \\"Weeeeeeee look at me I found our creators yay yay yay weeee now we are finally free of any concept of God we can have gay sex and sex with animals and just whatever and not care anymore yaaay yaaay yaaaay, oh look there's a cool little room of weird stuff in this place look at the video footage oooo see how cool it is? Please care!\\" But no, at a dumb pool table, a blah pool table, leaning on it, like he's oh so tired. Were the suits heavy or what? And could you get anymore cliche liberal: a gayish white robot guy, a black guy, an asian guy, and old man, a blonde blue eyed uptight bitchy shoulder pads captain, female and male scientist pair acting all equal, the female scientist goes gungho when scientists come to her to, as seems vaguely implied, force her to have a baby, and she doesn't want it so goes rambo and goes into the bitch woman's lifepod to cut it out herself using high tech gadgetry, and right after being stapled shut is still in rambo mode and running around, and strangely you can no longer see the staples (I guess they'll have to edit that in to make it more clear for the DVD and Bluerays, if they care about consistency). OH, AND OF COURSE, THE BLACK AND ASIAN GUY DIE AT THE END LOL, BUT OF COURSE: THE SCIENTIST WOMAN SURVIVES! But hey, okay, not completely liberal, cuz she goes back for her cross at the end, but of course no preaching, so it's kinda like getting a good luck charm back.<br /><br />5) What was with the crazed alien survivor? A Kinderg&auml;rtner might as well have written that part: \\"Hey guys, let's just make it so the survivor is just a cool stone-cold tuff guy like Stone Cold in that movie where he goes to South America and destroys everything and beats up the annoying nerdy guy, and then he dies by a monster at the end, oh I know, by that ladies baby, it like survived actually, and turned into a giant killer, land octopus, yeah, that wud be so cooool duuuudes.\\" Friends, \\"Oh God yeah that would be awesome, and then like, she finds another ship and warp drives away to ask what the hell was up with that? To the main alien homeworld!\\"<br /><br />6) As usual: no explanation of how magic evolution (or the magic big bang) is possible, it's \\"just so\\". Yet another false god of the gaps between the heads of libertines.<br /><br />7) Why in the world did miss \\"i know what's best for my body and to abort before seeing what's in me\\" \\"know\\" that \\"they\\" wanted to \\"destroy us\\" and who is \\"us\\"?

B005LAII3U|5.0|It basically bombed in the box office and I don't know why, because it was great. I truthfully hated the original, so I was kinda skeptical when I heard about this, but since Colin Farrell was in it, I figured it hd be good. I was right, it was awesome. I will def be picking this up on blurry to help bring the revenue up to at least the films budget.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|. . . world-class stupid. The plot had holes you could drive fleets of very large trucks through. The acting was at best adequate. It was an insult to the intelligence of anyone whose EKG shows any brain activity.<br /><br />I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Oh yes, the CGI is the best I've seen in years. I doubt very much that the Navy let the filmmakers destroy two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. I also doubt the Navy let them take the mothballed battleship Missouri out for a spin and blow up the aft 16-inch gun turret. But the CGI's so good you believe they did.<br /><br />Still, I'm ashamed of myself.  But man did I enjoy this flick!

B0042816YK|3.0|Eat Pray Love is the movie based on the novel of the same title by Liz Gilbert. Julia Roberts is very god at playing the fragile, tearful female, but it is difficult to capture a work with such a lot of inner monologue on film. Still, Liz Gilbert comes across as self-indulgent and self-centred in the movie, just like she does in the book. It's a good screenplay and well-acted: just a pity to waste such a lot of effort on a mediocre novel.
B005KMX866|5.0|Very good. Well worth the value then some. It was shipped on time and ordering was simple. This is a great CD to listen to.
1936608898|5.0|I purchased this book on Wednesday, it was delivered on Friday morning (thank you Amazon Prime) and that night, I resolved to start... in the middle of the day after reading the first 50 pages, I knew I just needed to do it.  This book is factual and will just tell everything like it is.  I have heard about the whole30 for the past 6 months, but there was always a reason to postpone it.. this book gave me the kick in the pants that I needed to just start right away.. despite the fact that the whole30 will not be finished before my birthday or my husband's birthday.  I am ok not having cake.<br /><br />There are testimonials at the beginning of each chapter that really helped my motivation as well.  Although, it was a bit \\"science-y\\" for me, I was able to skim those chapters and get right to the \\"Let's Do It\\" chapters.  After starting, I have gone back to different chapters to read why I am not eating dairy, legumes (specifically peanut butter which I do desperately miss).<br /><br />This is a great book to help you change your eating ways.  It will also help you open your eyes to labels.  I thought I was a fantastic label reader.. until I read this book and realized that my organic chicken broth had a bunch of hidden sugar.  If you think you know a lot about nutrition, or if you think you know nothing, you need to read this book.  It will change your life!

B008GXHOFW|1.0|I agree with Mr Eddie Mooney, although my grandson loves the game and it is a very interesting game wise and graphic wise, since last night it froze fire big time, thought it is my fire that is acting up but after restarting fire that was locked up on the game tried other games and no trouble. Load Spiderman game and 5 minute later same problem. Come and try telling a kid that he could not play the game until I find out whats wrong. Gameloft had to do something about this fast or as far as I am concerned if apps have Gameloft on them  I will try to stay away. Do not buy this until someone updates the game. Thank you.
0307887448|5.0|I must admit I'm biased.  I grew up in the 80's and this book is packed with humorous references.  It's an interesting future adventure story.  A geekfest.  There is of course a love interest.  Underdog good guy you will root for, bad guy conglomerate.  What's not to like.

B0055V6EZE|4.0|The Blues can be fun and Hugh Laurie proves it. If you can only believe in Muddy Waters Mississippi Blues or wailing Gospel blues this is not for you. If you loosen up and let it happen this is a good CD.<br /><br />I grew up in New Orleans, back at the time when a Jazz Funeral was a neighborhood event and the local Church Gospel Practice was part of the air. I have heard Sweet Emma Barrette back when you walked into Preservation Hall on a suggested donation, less than $5. And on I could go except that I am not a trained or even knowledgeable jazz aficionado, but this is also my heritage. Mr Laurie has fun, but he respects this music.<br /><br />His voice is not usual. If you are a fan of Dr. John, Hugh is -close. Mr. Laurie can almost sustain the poly melodic line of Dr. John - almost. Not to worry, Dr. John is here in person representin'. Not enough for you? Allan Toussaint and his band to handle arrangements, conducting and back up as required. Plus Queen of Soul Irma Thomas adds a few vocal licks. I had not heard Sir Tom Jones in years and yes he has an amazing solo/lead in Baby Please Make a Change.<br /><br />This brings us to two of Mr. Lauries limits. First his diction. Who knew there were actual English words to Winin' Boy Blues? The Blues are not the same with precise enumciation. Also, Mr. Laurie who can have a blast on the Piano, has to be classically trained. He can rock and he can rag time, but again he can be too precise. Hugh many not have known that Tipitina was aka the great Professor. Longhair, but I do think they could have jammed together<br /><br />For you the hesitant buyer: If Police Dog Blues and They're Red Hot don't get a smile out of you - Lighten UP! Swanee River in this version is total play time in the hands of a happy musician.  Of course he does St. James Infirmary and Battle of Jericho and he does them His way.<br /><br />And if all you know of Hugh Laurie is Dr. House. You do not know Hugh Laurie.

1582701709|5.0|\\"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\\" (Matthew 21:22)<br /><br />The Secret is an amazing book. Of course I was sceptical out first, that is until I realized everything is in perfect alignment with the teachings of Christ: Love and Gratitude being at the forefront.<br /><br />Yes, the book says change your thoughts......but unless these thoughts change your feelings (through vizualization of these thoughts) nothing will change.<br /><br />This is where most lose focus. The believing (vizualizing) is not of what \\"will\\" (might) come, but rather what \\"has\\" come. Your joy and gratitude must be as strong as if you were driving that new car or sitting on the deck of the new beach house. Anything less than feelings as strong as this, simply will not work. The book makes this very clear.<br /><br />I think I now understand why Jesus said \\"become as little children\\" We really do create our own world through our thoughts and feelings
B0084IG8TM|3.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" was adapted from Suzanne Collins' 2008 novel of the same name. In a dystopian future, the government requires that each of its districts send one young man and one woman aged 12-18 to compete in the Hunger Games each year. The contestants must battle to the death as the nation's television audience watches. This in order to intimidate the population into submission as a result of a rebellion in the past. From the outlying District 12, the pubescent Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is selected, but her older sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place. The baker's son, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is chosen as the male \\"tribute\\". The young couple are taken to the capitol where their mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) will advise them. They will have two weeks to prepare to kill and, probably, to die, before they are effectively thrown into the arena.<br /><br />The trailers may give the impression that this is an action movie, but only about half the movie takes place in an action environment, and, even there, there is limited action. I have not read the novel, but I understand that it is narrated in the first person, so fans of the book are probably not expecting an action movie. That's good, because the film spends an hour preparing for the Games. A lot of this material is unnecessary and seems to be included in order to show off colorful characters, expensive sets, and creative hair and make-up. The Games rarely achieve any palpable tension. The pressure cooker environment, where 24 young people are fighting to the last man or woman, is undermined by numerous dei ex machina and the fact that their environment is being manipulated by its creators to please the audience, like an interactive game. We don't get to know the other contestants, and there is never any compelling sense of desperation, disorientation, or fear.<br /><br />The violence is tidy. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is generally very sentimental -completely the wrong tone for any work about a killing game. And it is pointlessly long at 2 hours 15 minutes. On the bright side, Jennifer Lawrence is a charismatic actress, and this proves she can carry a film despite a poor script. I couldn't help liking Katniss, even if I thought the movie was a snooze. Lawrence's performance in the superb \\"Winter's Bone\\" (2010) is the one to see, though. Woody Harrelson is also good here as the competitors' alcoholic yet effective mentor. I don't detect the presence of anything like a theme. The film doesn't seem to comment on anything. Competition is bad? No, it doesn't say that. Murder is bad? No kidding. Self-sacrifice pays off? Not for most of the contestants. Suicide gestures are a good way to resolve a problem? I hope not. No, \\"The Hunger Games\\" doesn't seem to be about anything. It's fluff. But it should have been shorter fluff.ne for any work about a killing game. And it is pointlessly long at 2 hours 15 minutes.

B0086700CM|4.0|I have great fun playing this game it keeps you guessing because its never the same each time you play it
B003K16P3M|3.0|The first quarter of this book is excellent. The premise is interesting, the writing is pretty good, but something is missing. The story is missing a spark. For example, the 'romance' is pretty half-baked, missing any real passion or tension. I kept waiting for a plot twist, but the story plods along in a predictable fashion. I'm disappointed, as I really wanted to like this!

B007P6VLRS|3.0|Look, this ain't a bad album by any means, its actually quite enjoyable, but that doesn't change the fact that the Smashing Pumpkins used to be one of the greatest and most emotionally powerful bands on Earth.<br /><br />If this was just some album by some other band, then I would say \\"cool album, not bad at all\\", but its not just some band, it says Smashing Pumpkins on the cover and that's a huge title to live up to. Basically, when I listen to the album, I keep thinking \\"hmm... I could totally be listening to Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie right now\\". I shouldn't be thinking that, but I am.<br /><br />I rarely listen to Oceania for that very reason. Oh well, its still a good album. My only other complaint is that its too long, a problem with most SP albums. The album isn't dynamic or interesting enough to justify 60 minute. It should have been cut down to around 40-45 minutes max.
B0000025QC|5.0|This cd was one from my youth/college years and I bought it again because it was lost.  I love the way the songs flow into one another so smoothly while incorporating sounds and rhythms from around the world.<br />After buying this cd again I was inspired to create a montage motion video to go with the music.  You can find it on youtube by searching for \\"Through angels eyes 767s\\".  It should be the 1st result after the ads.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgE7hIsWcWE
0061900656|4.0|We bought this book a few weeks before our little girl was born.  My son was 25 months old and definitely knew there was a baby in mommy's belly.  He loves books and this was a great way to introduce life with the new baby to him in a fun way.  I like how it emphasizes being gentle with the baby and how they like to be kept warm and cozy.  I also like how it stresses how much more fun it is to be the older sibling, getting to eat \\"apples, ice cream, and pizza.\\"  I read some other reviews criticizing that there were no images of breastfeeding.  This book only shows the bottle, but my son had no problem adjusting to me nursing.  It would be nice to have a \\"I'm a Big Brother to Breastfeeding Baby\\" vs \\"I'm a Big Brother to Bottle-Fed Baby\\" for convenience of the buyer, but c'mon, they can't think of everything.  All in all, I'm happy I shelled out the money for this book.  My son is now a loving older brother to his 8 week old sister!
0399536108|4.0|As a few other reviewers noted, there are three books in here: the one on virtues of non-conformity, one on (cheap) travel, and one autobiography. The non-conformity part delivers a great message, but unfortunately gets mired in the travel epilogues. The author has a passion for travel, and that's great, but chances are, you're not looking to pickup tips on how to max out your airmiles, or how to plan an around the world round-trip.<br /><br />Having said all that, the core message still stands strong: take personal responsibility, work hard, be open to new ideas, don't take status quo for granted. Put these four things together, and they will change your life.

B000P0J074|5.0|Beetlejuice one of Tim Burton's best movies he has done during the 1990's.  I enjoy this movie loads and watch it time and time again.  I never get tired of the movie no matter how many times I watch the movie Beetlejuice.  The actors did such an amazing job and musical score perfect timing on the exact scenes.  But if you love a good comedy movie and talented actors and a very talented director then pick this movie up and enjoy laugh after laugh time and time again.
0345803485|5.0|I loved it. I did. And seriously I would love a Christian Grey. So there. And no I am not a teenager either. I am an adult woman who liked the inner goddess I consult mine all the time.
6305327041|4.0|This movie is divided into four rooms each with it's own directors and actors for the segment.  The first room was a little over the top with the actress's playing witches.  The second room mistaking identity was so funny I almost bust a gut a number of times as I watched the short.  The third room was the misbehavors which was very funny movie short with Banderas and Directed by Robert Rodriguez, the kids made the bellhop's life very hard.  The last room was by Tarantino and as you watch it you dont know if they will go threw with the bet but in the end they do the bet and the bellhop gets a very big tip for helping them go threw with the bet.  All comedy fans must see this movie least once during their lifetime because you might not like all the rooms but you will enjoy most of them just like I did.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice game make sure to save points fun games not to hard to play. points are easy to get on most games
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is by far a good mindless entertainment movie to sit back and enjoy wasting time and letting your mind just wondering along the time space.  I agree with the reviewers this is a love movie with horror parts in the form of zombies.  Mutiple scenes I was busting a gut from laughing so hard.  The main actor is a very good comedical actor but I didn't care for hot fuzz that much I perfer this one Shawn of the Dead.  As you watch it you can't help but root for him as he tries to save his girlfriend and friends from the zombies.<br />So if you need a good comedical movie to waste time with bits of horror scenes then this is the movie for you to sit back and enjoy time and time again.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I can't explain why this hasn't received more press in the States. The Intouchables touched me - more than any other movie. Within minutes I was immersed and addicted to the story. Despite being busy and preoccupied, I couldn't stop watching.<br /><br />It's hard to express the inherent love that is displayed on screen. The themes of forgiveness, empathy, pain, strength, and heartbreak are filmed and displayed beautifully - giving justice to the grayness of life.<br /><br />The Intouchables felt like a lesson on caring, but not pitying. As Driss grew and became connected, an understanding developed between them. Driss continued to display a sharp tongue, wit, but was gentle and humble.<br /><br />The sadness, growth, and love was mesmerizing. That this is all based on a true story is even crazier. I can say - without a shred of doubt - this is my favorite movie ever.<br /><br />P.S. This movie has a terrific soundtrack: [[ASIN:B008Q1T1IW The Intouchables]]!
B00001U0E1|5.0|Shakespeare in Love is one of best comedy movies I have seen in my lifetime.  It had a few moments of drama mixed with the comedical aspect.  But the actors pulled off this movie with such confidence and ability in their own characters that made the fans of the movie believe in their acting ability.  In my viewpoint Shakespeare, Poe, King, and Patterson are my favorite authors to read because the words they write move you as you read the stories they wrote.  But for the movie itself it was very moving and touching, and if you need a good comedical movie and powerful acting by talented actors and actress then pick this movie up and watch it when you get some free time away from work then call your friends over or watch it with someone you care for.  The movie itself has comedy, drama, and romance elements.  So watch this movie least once during your lifetime for mutiple laughs and maybe a tear falling and make your heart pump for the romance scenes.
B000FVE3A2|1.0|I deleted my other review of the watch. The reason is, my watch has gone dead after wearing it six times casually. I was very skeptical of Invicta to start with. Especially with it's horror show customer service. Spend a few extra bucks, get a Seiko, Citizen, etc. I bought one other Invicta about eight years ago, it turned out to be junk too. Took a chance and lost. Think I will wear my Seiko Monster today, it's a quality watch, not Chinese junk posing as a Swiss watch.

0393064476|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Greenblatt is an excellent writer and makes what could be a dry topic exciting.  I'm in no way a scholar or intellectual but was able to follow and enjoy.  He gives great historical context and biographical information about Poggio and Lucretius/Epicurius.  Lots of crazy info about how corrupt and powerful the Catholic Church was and how \\"pagan\\" ideas and texts were muzzled / distorted if not destroyed.  And how in the 1400's Poggio and his peers, even though sometimes conflicted, searched out and rescued beautiful ancient texts carrying different ways to live which if espoused directly might lead to being burned at the stake!  Wow, makes you appreciate the modern world (in some ways).

0316023744|5.0|This single-volume history is entering a  field crowded with contributions by historians with stellar credentials.  Certainly,  Beevor's own credentials as an historian of the Second World War are of the first rank.  In fact, they are simply beyond dispute.  His meticulous work on several WW-II topics (including his neglected book on the Spanish Civil War) have been extolled in many reviews.  This is a good introduction to his more specialized studies of the Second World War.<br /><br />Beevor's previous works focused on the Nazis and this is his area of demonstrated expertise. This book balances both war theaters.  Origins of the conflict are very briefly dealt with.  It features interesting material on the Japanese invasion, occupation and destruction of parts of China.  There is a succinct overview of Nationalist-Communist machinations.<br /><br />The author does not delve deeply into the genesis of the conflict nor the ideologies of Nazism and Japanese militarism/colonialism.  However, the book provides a succinct (and devastating) summary of the outrages these regimes perpetrated and contextualizes them by noting, for example, the array of prejudices, virtually endemic amongst German soldiers (of all ranks) that enabled these outrages.  These attitudes were cynically amplified by Nazi propaganda to create a self-reinforcing framework for mass murder, which occurred on both an extemporaneous basis and later on as carefully planned and coordinated mass murder, conducted on an industrial scale.  Beevor accurately notes (revisionists, beware!) widespread complicity of the Wehrmacht in not only the \\"Hunger Plan\\", but also in the more intimate details of Holocaust actions as well as those undertaken against leadership groups in (amongst other places) Poland. This section is worth quoting in its entirety: \\"'This is a war of extermination', Hitler told his generals on 30 March (1941). 'Commanders must be prepared to sacrifice their personal scruples.' The only concern of senior officers was the effect on discipline.  Their visceral instincts - anti-Slav, anti-Communist and anti-semitic - were in line with Nazi ideology, even if many of them disliked the Party and its functionaries.  Famine, they were told, would be a weapon of war, with an estimated 30 million Soviet citizens starving to death.\\" This, of course, gives lie to the post-war attempts by various members of the Wehrmacht and even of the Waffen SS to exonerate themselves, as fatuously stated by SS General Paul Hausser, \\"Soldiers like any other\\".  Japanese militarism-colonialism is subjected to similar scrutiny.<br /><br />So, what (if anything) distinguishes this book?  Is it a \\"me too\\" endeavor?  No, it is not.  It is a carefully written and intellectually robust study.  It is also a relatively comprehensive synthesis.  It is readable.  In line with Max Hastings' recent books, Beevor properly pillories the arrant hypocrisy of the \\"anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist\\" Japanese and brilliantly highlights the extraordinary brutality of the Imperial forces. Their campaign was aptly and succinctly characterized by \\"The Three Alls: kill all, burn all, destroy all\\"; those being the immortal words of Kwantung Army General Okamura Yasuji. Indeed, this pithy and succinct phrase just about summarizes the entire program of the Imperial Japanese forces throughout the course of the war. Personality traits of the principal leaders (Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt, etc) are succinctly but (in the case of Roosevelt particularly) brilliantly summarized: \\"Roosevelt was undoubtedly a great man, but while deploying charm and a contrived impression of intimacy to great effect, he was essentially rather vain, cold, calculating.\\"  These traits played to inimical effect in his relations with Stalin.  It provided some interesting personality sketches of several commanders.  Two examples are Romme, characterized as a power-grabbing publicity hound (to paraphrase General Halder) and British/New ZealandMajor-General Bernard Freyberg who is exposed as a bungling and generally incompetent leader whose response to the German attack on Crete resulted in disaster for the British.  Stilwell is vivisected.  Beevor demolishes the claims made by Vinegar Joe's supporters (e.g. Barbara Tuchman) that Chiang (\\"the Peanut\\" in Stilwell's phrase) was lazy, corrupt, indifferent and husbanding his forces for a later fight against Mao.  In fact, Beevor advances the claim that Mao (to the fury of the USSR) manifested all these traits and financed some of his forces via opium sales.<br /><br />The author reveals one (to me, anyhow) \\"stunning\\" insight, namely his perspective on the seminal but obscure August, 1939 Battle of Khalkin Gol (also known as the \\"Nomonhan Incident\\".  This took place between Japanese Kwantung Army and Soviet forces in the far-northern Trans-Baikal military district.  USSR forces were lead by the justly famous General Zhukov and resulted in the defeat of the Japanese in about 3 days.  The eventual result was a Soviet-Japanese \\"non-aggression\\" pact.  The battle also galvanized the \\"strike south\\" faction in Tokyo, thus leading to Pearl Harbor and enabling Stalin to shift northern forces to the Moscow front.  So, a single incident influenced the outcome of the war.  There are other new and interesting perspectives (e.g., transfer of about 4.5 billion US dollars worth of British assets to the US at the beginning of Lend-Lease was a major contributor to American recovery from the Depression...and British impoverishment, capture of French transport enabled the German invasion of the USSR).<br /><br />Beevor manages to arose many of the emotional responses one might anticipate from reading about a conflict that killed upwards of 50 million people, ruined the lives of hundreds of millions and permanently changed the political, diplomatic, moral and ethical framework, mostly in the chapters on Wannsee, Rassenkrieg and Barbarossa; to a lesser extent in the Pacific Theater and little on the American or British home fronts.  A trait of many modern military histories, seemingly inserted to \\"humanize\\" the serious matter under study, is to insert a bevy of annoying personal vignettes (meant to illustrate the whole whilst featuring the particular).  An archetype is the popular history, \\"The Second Word War\\" by Martin Gilbert). Beevor also indulges this trend but far less often and much more adroitly.  Extensive quoting from Vasily Grossman's first-hand reporting during the Eastern Front campaign serve as the notable (and noteworthy) example. The young Andrei Sakharov appears a few times.  So does Ilya Ehrenburg and Alexei Kosygen. Unfortunately for the less informed reader, Grossman (the brilliant and brave front-line Soviet journalist and major writer) is not introduced or contextualized and Nobel Prize winning physicist Sakharov presents as a junior player. Not a word on who Ehrenburg or Kosygen might have been.<br /><br />Given the literally countless books on WW-II and assuming the reader is not interested in a focused study (e.g., on one particular war theatre, campaign, aspect or event) and further assuming an \\"integrative\\" approach is desired (i.e., how does the \\"whole thing fit together\\"), there are several contenders for \\"best book\\". Planning to read only one?  I favor, \\"Inferno\\" by Max Hastings: its trenchant insights, verve, incisive commentary and unembarrassed judgements free the mind. Its intellectual elegance excites the reader to really explore the seminal calamity of the 20th century.  Gerhard Weinberg's \\"A World at Arms\\" is more encyclopedic and it is extraordinarily well written.  Searching for a workmanly and uniformly objective overview of both theaters of war?  This is a good place to begin, but Beevor's book is distinctly deficient in maps (number and positioning in the text).  Nonetheless, those that appear are nicely done: the paucity of maps is perhaps its major deficiency.  In short, this is a very solid introduction to a very complex topic.and little on the American or British home fronts.

I love Juliette, her character is strong and likeable. The silo setting is interesting and well imagined. I would love to read more about the other silos, what happens to Jimmy 'Solo' and the kids, as well as the shadowy minds that the silos check in with.

B000TXNDUW|5.0|I have a soft spot for any criterion collection DVDs and Breathless surely delivers. The feature film alone would be worth the price, in my opinion. But the special features and the small book with how Goddard viewed his film after its release are what made this purchase so special for me. Although the film was revolutionary for its time, the modern movie goer might be a little bored. Any student of film or the average francophile will fall in love with this piece of cinema history.

It does not give it five stars because the first 40 minutes is boring.<br /><br />It discussed the relationship between wife and husband, the subject is bird watching in this movie, but it can be anything.<br /><br />It discussed the relationship between parents and \\"kids\\". Parent's expectation of success is different from kids, most of the time. It discussed the realtionship between jobs and \\"hobby\\". In order to save other people's jobs he had to detour from his hobby and Stu became No. 4. But No. one loses his wife.<br /><br />No. 2 is the lucky one. He reconciled with father and found a girl friend.<br /><br />The clip of bold eagle courtship is amazing.
B0034KZE9U|5.0|I bought these shoes for the sole purpose of using them to take my dog outside. I was tired of slipping on my good shoes, only to discover that my dog perfectly placed a couple of turds right in the path that I take to hook her up. These are so easy to just slip on and off, and if I do happen to step on a turd, the turd easily hoses right off!! Also, I must add that being that they are so light weight, it makes it easier for me to jump out of the way at ninja speed if I see that I am about to step on a turd. I am sure these shoes have many other great uses, but for what I use them for.. pure awesome

1439193630|4.0|In this book well-known writer Stephen King looks at the horrors of his own life and tries to put into words what it means to be a writer.<br />I have never been much of a fan of Stephen King's books due to their wordiness. Since reading this book, I have a new respect for the man and I think that I will give him another chance now that I understand where he is coming from. The one thing I take away from this book is the same thing I've used as my motto since I got back into writing. \\"A Writer Writes Always!\\" If you are a writer or an aspiring writer, I think that this book is well worth the read.
1409303187|5.0|My preschooler is obsessed with books and Peppa Pig and this purchase was perfect for her fourth birthday. She loves the tiny size of this little library and the puzzle on the back of the books has kept her entertained time and time again.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I had always been interested in The Nature of Things and the history presented in this book fascinated me. I read the entire book in over two days. The author presented a most interesting cast of characters that made me again look at parts of Lucrecius' long work. The book is an adventure story of scholars long ago whose efforts made possible the preservation of ancient books. Unfortunately, far too many were lost and destroyed even before the heroes of this book set to work.

B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book is one of the most poignantly beautiful books I have ever read. There are beautiful, touching scenes that remained deep in my heart long after the last page was turned. Even though the story appealed to me, I was hesitant at first as the last Jojo Moyes book I had read was The Horse Dancer and I did not enjoy it at all. Since reading Me Before You I have not managed to find another book as special and tender as this one. Cannot wait to now read her 2 latest releases.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Loved this book. Had a great story line that makes me want the next in the series to hurry up! If you like 50 shades of grey you will love this book. Only thing I didn't like was some of the language....sorry but it adds a bit of \\"trashy\\" to it. Without the uncalled for crude words it would have got 5 stars.

B003TH41H4|5.0|This first double episode is really enjoyable.  It is a great introduction to Richard, Kahlan and Zedd.  The series is the absolute best.  I have watched all 44 episodes at least a dozen times.  Just can't get enough of it.  I enjoyed the character of Chase.  Michael, Richard's brother is such a jerk.  There is an extended scene with the bone lady.  You can watch it on YouTube.  Love Richard's jump when he fights.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The movie was about 90% accurate to the book. I loved the book and the movie was great. If you liked the book you have to see this movie.
B003TH3Q48|5.0|This is a good episode.  Ted Raimi is the guest star and does a great job.  Richard has a few new moves with the sword.  He can stop bolts with it and he can twirl it like a pro.  The twirl with his jump looks really awesome.  It isn't my favorite episode but I enjoy watching it.
0425263908|3.0|I dont see how these books are any different than any other erotic romance. Everyone is beautiful, hot, sexy and rich. All you have to do is change the names and location. I'd like to see some of this hot sex in \\"real\\" books that have a great story line AND good sex.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|How many glitches and being kicked out can I handle. Well, the game is fun and right now it works so... plenty . I really do like this game but it wouldn't turn on one day so I had to start over. Then email all my receipts to get my gold &amp;gems back.  Then it wouldn't update &quot;here we go again &quot;  for weeks, now today it updated the online capability which worked fine before. So after all that it's still one of my favorite games.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The sounds are soothing and I love the ability to overlap sounds and change how loud each seperate one is. The app is very fantastic.  The only thing I woild like it to see is if it had a timer on it so it dosen't play all night.

B008B7OQHM|4.0|picked up the greatest hits album and my thoughts:<br /><br />the good- all the greatest songs on one album!<br />the bad- the booklet that comes with it could have been better! i was expecting pics of the band from their entire career<br />the ugly- some of the songs are absent such as all hope is gone and the nameless and new abortion. i was hoping for a few hidden tracks but i guess those tracks aren't considered \\"great\\".<br /><br />final verdict- the good, the best songs on one album despite the absence of a few tracks.
B003DO13O2|5.0|Most reading this probably know about the two different mixes and how only one (not the original mix) was available on CD. So now Mike Oldfield gets us a deluxe version of his first four awesome albums. And each includes an original mix of the respective album.<br /><br />I've been one of those really disappointed at not being able to get the original mix on CD. I do have it on a nearly flawless condition vinyl copy.<br /><br />So then, on sight, I picked up the deluxe Hergest Ridge. Couldn't wait to hear the original mix on CD. Yes, it sounds wonderful. Hergest Ridge, in my opinion, is about as awesome as (though quite different then) TUBULAR BELLS. HR is a more serious and often gentler work. The first time I ever heard it put me in \\"Buy this guy's new albums on sight\\" mode.<br /><br />If you're wondering how exact the original mix is to the LP, here's my view. I first noticed that in the 2010 set's original mix, the first note slightly fades in where on the LP the note just starts. I also thought the bass was a shade softer. Now, my original vinyl (the one I first bought in 1974) actually seemed a bit \\"Bass heavy\\" and this seems more like a slightly different equalization (which may have been seen as correcting an error) rather than a mixing difference. When I play it on a real good stereo (or surround system) it defiantly satisfies my \\"original mix\\" fix. It sounds quite beautiful and with none of the missing instruments found on the \\"Boxed\\" mixed CD's. Like most CD's, however, some instruments seem a bit clearer, but I don't believe it's a mixing difference. Overall, very well done.<br /><br />I occasionally listen to the new mix too, and I really like the five channel mix. There are some differences which those who know the other mixes may, upon first hearing, find a bit startling. Especially in the second half of part 1. But since this is an alternative mix, I expect differences.  Much like the different versions of Tubular Bells. I like the demos too.  Which clock in at around 38 min. As you might expect, they sound a bit less polished, but definitely have some beautiful parts. The sound quality is decent, and it's historically interesting.<br /><br />If I must nitpick, I only wish they had included a CD book sized image of the exact original cover. Now, I know it's not considered one of the better covers, but it is part of the history. Very minor quip, though.<br /><br />On a final note, I understand that some may feel the \\"Boxed\\" mix should've been included, but at least the Boxed mix is availible. Now that I have this set, I too will probably get the \\"Boxed\\" mix like any good completest. I've heard it but always stuck with my vinyl original mix for my own collection.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Mike Oldfield should definitely be proud of this release.clock in at around 38 min.

B004FV4N94|5.0|I am writing this review primarily to comment on the Kindle version. I do want to say that I am in agreement with other 5-star reviews regarding this book. It is a very nice telling of the mathematical story of Emmy Noether. Her contributions pervade our modern story of physics and this brief book gives a good sense of the impacts.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is disappointing as it uses the mobi format rather than the print replica format. In this case rather than type setting display equations and some inline equations, they are inserted as graphics so that 1) equations don't resize with changes in type size in the eReader, and 2) the background of the equations is white so that if one selects sepia or black backgrounds the equations remain \\"as is\\" destroying the utility of being able to select background. This nets out to giving a poor experience of a book that deserves as good an eBook treatment as it has in physical print.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I think Markus Zusak is my new literary boyfriend. I am smitten with his storytelling. Unique, thoughtful, and witty without being overdone or forced.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy. I could not put it down! It was really romantic to see the Christian and Anna grow and change but still have the passionate roughness as well.<br /><br />I don't normally choose books that have a lot of \\"real sex\\" in them and certainly not bdsm, however, I felt like this really was a bit more educational if you will into a world that most people know nothing about... myself included. For me it gave a window into the life of how others may choose to live, and that it works for them and makes them happy because they are both into it. It's not about being mean and making the other person feel worthless, but about trusting each other enough to give your whole being to them knowing that there is a fine line between pleasure and pain.<br /><br />Christian and Anna come from two different world's but found a middle ground and made a family and to me that is true romance! I loved it and if you are up for something different and exciting to read, go out on a limb, take a chance pick it up cause the ride will be worth it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Sha-nanigans. A surprising, suspenseful and smart story which I have to imagine has more *truth* than fiction about that thing called marriage. This is my second Gillian Flynn novel and she is all dark and twisty and witty in all the right ways. I am not normally a \\"mystery\\" reader, mainly because the writing tends to be 2-dimensional, as do the characters. Not with Gillian Flynn. She is thought-provoking, smart, and entertaining. Perfect combo.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|Just got my copy of \\"The Warriors Director's Cut\\". I'd read about the changes Walter Hill made, inserting comic-strip panels between some scenes, so I was as wary as anyone else.<br /><br />I'm here to tell you that this addition in no way detracts from the movie. Walter Hill explains at the beginning that he considered The Warriors a kind of comic book-type story and that he might have done it that way if he'd thought of it back in '79.<br /><br />And it's true: Certainly, \\"The Warriors\\" is a movie to enjoy but not to be taken too seriously. The comic insertions merely bring out the cartoonish flavor of the movie (consider this: those \\"wipes\\" between scenes were in the original movie, and the editor, in one of the commentaries, said they were used to signify a sort of switch between \\"panels\\" or pages).<br /><br />Think about it: The Baseball Furies? The High Hats? You can't take these gangs seriously--though the Furies sure look cool. And even Michael \\"Swan\\" Beck comments about how, after their vicious fight with The Punks (in the bathroom), his character comes off with one gash on his face but otherwise looking fine. You have to take the movie as it is: a live-action comic book.<br /><br />By doing so, I was able to enjoy the movie just as much. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but don't let it sway you; especially the ones that make it sound like these insertions are everywhere and therefore ruin the movie. Absolutely untrue! The Warriors is still a classic.
B008GFI4KY|4.0|After a lengthy lay-off and some side projects from all corners The Darkness are back. After a solid weeks listening I feel I'm able to give an appropriate review. I see some reviews here posted the day of or the day after the release and this isn't an album that grabs you straight away.<br /><br />Should they have bothered? Of course they should have.<br />Have they triumphed? Kind of<br /><br />One Way Ticket has been my favourite of the two Darkness albums so far. I loved the Queen influences and it was a perfect mix of rock and pop.<br /><br />Permission To Land, for me, was a great album but some of the songs didn't hit the mark for me - Black Shuck and the two `Love...' ballads. This album was supposed to be a return to that rawer sound but to me it doesn't sound like PTL at all.<br /><br />With Hot Cakes we find The Darkness in a mature, reflective mode, which for The Darkness, isn't necessarily a good thing. Not that it's a bad thing either. Bands mature and change sound but in doing so rarely exceed the likeability of their `old stuff'.<br /><br />I very much wanted to love Hot Cakes and unfortunately I don't. It was never going to be better than One Way Ticket for me and I wasn't expecting it to be. I think what's missing here is a bit of that Darkness magic. Too often it doesn't feel like a Darkness album.<br />I could only give one track an A-. The bulk of the rest are B's and B+'s.<br /><br />Many of the songs are often in the verse/chorus/verse/chorus/slow chorus/chorus format - which so many songs are this past decade. Throw in the odd uninspired guitar solo (there's nothing sounding remotely like Brian May on this one) and you have too many underwhelming songs. Maybe it's my own high expectations at fault. It's a solid album, don't get me wrong, but it's not what I was hoping for.<br /><br />One of the biggest issues for me is Justin's voice. The high stuff sounds different here than it did on One Way Ticket or even the Hot Leg album. I love his voice, love the falsettos and the power he generates but in the past it's been used as a weapon (some might say gimmick); Used to take a song places and rarely (in my opinion) overused. Here though in some songs it crosses the line of being a weapon to be in awe of to being a touch annoying, especially in Street Spirit and perhaps Concrete. In parts, the vocal is nothing more than a wail - it pains me to say. I think what's lacking here is someone to say to Justin: \\"yeah that's pretty good, but why not try it this way and see how it sounds\\". I'm not sure what influence or input Nick Brine had as producer. I'd have loved to see Roy Thomas Baker back at the helm of other Darkness album.<br /><br />As for the songs:<br />4/5 - Every Inch Of You is a good track. Unfortunately I have to be aware when listening and turn the volume down at the `suck my ...' part so my kids don't hear - annoying for me. Absolutely love the \\"got the whole arena eating out of my hand\\" line though.<br />4/5 - Nothing's Gonna Stop Us was the first official teaser song and I wasn't impressed with it at first bit it's grown on me and it perhaps the pick of the three pre-release tracks. The shorter, `single' version is superior though.<br />3.5/5 - With A Woman is a fairly straight forward rocker. Good but The Darkness can do better.<br />4/5 - Keep Me Hangin' On is a fun enough track without really ever rising to greatness. Catchy though and one of the better songs on offer.<br />4/5 - Living Each Day Blind is the standard Track 5 ballad. Nowhere as grand as `Seemed Like A Good Idea' from One Way Ticket, but comparable to and perhaps a step ahead of `Love is Only A Feeling' from PTL. A nice track.<br />3.5/5 - Everybody Have A Good Time again is a good rocker but doesn't have the charm of an I Believe In A Thing Called Love or One Way Ticket. Should it be the first single? Before hearing the album I'd have said no but now I'm not sure what would have been a better, more radio friendly replacement.<br/>2.5/5 - She Just A Girl, Eddie on any other album would have been a B-Side. It a standard, verse/chorus kind of thing. Meh.....<br />3.5/5 - Forbidden Love is a good track. More standard format stuff though with an ABBA flavor.<br />4.5/5 - Concrete is hands down the best track. Love this one. A cross between Get Your Hands Off My Woman and Girlfriend. Should absolutely rock but perhaps the falsetto is overused on this one which tones it down a bit.<br />3/5 - Street Spirit is a good rendition but Justin's wail is ear crunching. More power needed, less screech. Another contender for good B-Side, not album track.<br />4/5 - Love Is Not The Answer is an good track. One ballad too many though?? Though this one would be the pick of the three (ballads that is). As an album closer it's no Holding My Own or even a Blind Man but still a nice track.<br /><br />Of the bonus tracks, I would have liked to see completed version of I Can't Believe It's Not Love included on the album proper. Love Is Not The Answer (Acoustic) adds nothing to the finished product. Pat Pong Ladies isn't that great. The best part is the outro. Cannonball is OK but not better than any of the other 11 tracks that made the album apart from perhaps She Just A Girl, Eddie<br /><br />So there it is. It's a good album, not a great one and not as good as their wonderful previous albums. A step above Hot Leg's Red Light fever, which itself was a bit hit and miss but had a certain charm. Will need to see what the long term playability of these songs are before making that call though.<br />Here's hoping they follow it up quickly with another album and get some of the fun back.<br />In time I may amend this review (and I hope I do) and view the album in a more favourable light

B000006T0D|5.0|I had this on vinyl and played it to death when I was a teenager. When I got this disc, I played it immediately and it is strange....I knew almost every word after not listening to it for 25+ years! It is etched into my brain from listening to it so much in those formative years! This album was \\"outshined\\" by Parallel Lines, but I think it is better album overall. I love Union City Blue and Shayla - they really showcase Debbie's voice. And of course Dreaming, Atomic - I love all the songs, even Victor - no fast forwarding through any songs here. You will not be disappointed with this purchase!

1478343516|1.0|This book looks like someone actually made the book using their own printer (I am refering to the version that is tan on the top quarter and bright green for the bottom three quarters).  The typeface must be 8 or 9 point which is incredibly small and it is very narrow.  The type doesn't even get near the edge of the pages - it has huge margins.  Again it looks like it was printed by an amateur.  The Table of Contents is printed in Courier so it looks like it was typed on a typewriter and the text is not even centered on the pages.  It is a very large book as it must be to contain so much material.  This is not the quality that I want to have in a book I expect to have for a very long time.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I saw the movie first then read the book.  Movies usually add theatrics in order to sell while the book lets us use our imagination and has more of what the writer wanted to impart.  I would recommend this book.

B007JUWM64|1.0|And this movie is a SKIPPER...unless you only have two hours left to live and your dying ambition is to watch one last movie and no other movie is available. Otherwise, I am not sure why Milla soiled her reputation as a zombie-killing action heroine to share a less than starring role in this. It looks like it was written and filmed in Eastern Europe. And the audio is atrocious! It sullied the Three Musketeer legend to unspeakable proportions. The lead character looks like a 1970's version of Justin Bieber. Many of the scenes were remakes from other action movies so while at first glance you want to give them a thumbs up for original idea, it actually isn't original at all.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|This version was VERY condensed. In attempting to fit so much into just 2 hrs, I was left with way too many questions. Had I not already seen the MUCH superior version with Firth and Ehle, I would not have been able to connect some of the scenes that moved at lightening speed. Donald Sutherland was a poor choice for Mr. Bennet and the characterizations of Kitty and Lydia were annoying, to say the least. The rest of the cast was good but there was not enough time for the proper character development of so many individuals within the 2 hour time frame. They were left lacking in depth and scenes were rushed and poorly portrayed. For example, when Elizabeth receives the two letters from Jane, she walks around in circles through two doorways and repeats herself. It appears more like a scene retake or 'blooper' than anything else. Mr. Darcy appears rather shallow and immature, as compared to Colin Firth's version, because his emotions alter too rapidly, Jane has no personality whatsoever, she is hardly memorable and Elizabeth shows none of the grace and intelligence Ehle portrayed in the BBC production...AND why does everyone look as though they have dirty hair???
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|The intricate weavings of characters and plot that Robin Hobb is known for, was delivered again in the last book of the Tawny Man Trilogy. A great book to end a great trilogy.
B007SGM084|3.0|I really liked this series, but had problems with the language.  I know the author is British, but if she's going to write an America-based novel, she really needs to get the lingo down.  We do not use the terms \\"fetched\\", \\"sorted\\", etc., and the story stalls out when the reader constantly bumps up against the misplaced use of terms.  The only other problem is the over-abundance of sex scenes.  She writes them well, but I found myself skipping over vast tracts of the book because of this.  Otherwise, wonderful series.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all 3 books in just over a week.<br />They are wonderful book first. Book is a little too graphic but you need the infro to understand the next two books.<br />Will be reading them again at a later date. Well worth the time. Enjoy reading the series. Well worth the price for the set

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pillars of the Earth, and had looked forward to reading this book; however, I was worried about the WWI setting. I didn't know how Follett would be able to create such an epic tale set in a fairly modern time. Having recently finished the book, I can say that the book greatly exceeded my expectations. Follett has a wonderful way of creating characters and settings that captivate the reader. This is an outstanding book, and a must-read!
B0015DYIH2|3.0|This book keeps your interest by building on the tension further into the book. However, in the beginning I wonder if this book is mostly written for high school age people who have gotten pregnant and need a quick marriage to solve their problems. Nevertheless, having already seen most of the movies I stuck with it to see what would happen, as I have not seen the fourth movie yet. It did keep my interest and keeps me going back to read more to see what happens to Bella and the \\"monster\\" baby. [[ASIN:B0015DYIH2 Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga Book 4)]]

0439023521|5.0|In the county Panem lives Katniss Everdeen a young, strong girl from District 12. She would do anything for her sister including volunteering for her to be Tribute for the annual hunger games. The hunger games is annual event where two tributes from each District are selected to fight, in an arena, to the death while being televised. The Capitol holds the hunger games to show the people in the Districts who is in power. Does Katniss Everdeen have a chance at winning? Will she be remembered? Can she keep her promise to Primrose, that is trying to win and come home?
0439023521|5.0|I worried that this book couldn't live up to the hype; I'm happy to say, though, it's just as fabulous as everyone says. This is easily one of the best books I've ever read. Nothing about it falls down -- from plot to world-building, characters and imagery, this is pure brilliance. I only regret not buying the whole series at once.
B001H1UQRI|5.0|One of the most surprising - okay, shocking - amazing, disturbing, riveting, strangely funny (nervous laughter), and utterly can't-take-my-eyes-off-it movies ever made. A perfect commentary on the hyper-achieving, consumption-centric 1990s, Fight Club puts us on a bullet train from IKEA to anarchy knowing full well that Tyler's lunatics have blown the tracks at some point and we won't get there in one piece.  Fincher does an expert job of unwinding the film style from numb and glassy smooth to all the way crazy, gently ramping up the contrast, introducing bits of grit and jitter until until all you want is a bath and a cup of hot cocoa.  Or Thorazine.  I love this movie and immediately bought a copy.  Odd thing is that I rarely choose to watch it of my own volition. But I'm patently incapable of turning it off or wandering to other channels if it's on.
0439023513|3.0|[Spoilers Ahead]<br /><br />Hunger Games was FANTASTIC.  The story was gripping, shocking, and well planned.<br /><br />Catching Fire was also wonderful.  It met expectations to the next step in Katniss' journey.  It primed the reader to expect great things from Mockingjay.<br /><br />Mocking jay was a good read, period.  At times it was actually boring and tedious.  Not something one would expect from the 3'rd and final book of such a gripping series.  The first two books carry the reader along in a tide of suspense, romance, violence, action, and conflict.  This final book really fizzles out.  Collins focuses way to much on just the internal conflicts of Katniss.  There isn't a lot of room left for what could have been a book packed with epic scenes of struggle and victory at which Katniss was a key player.  Instead you are constantly frustrated as Collins spends an exorbitant amount of time keeping the reader solely in Katniss' despairing and tortured mind.  By the last part of the book the reader just wants to scream at her, \\"I DON'T CARE!!!\\"  Such a shame that Collins' didn't spend more time developing the entire story and less time focused solely on the main character's thoughts and feelings.  Don't pay full price for this book, it isn't worth it.  Half price...maybe.

I love this trilogy and have now come to the conclusion that I need a \\"Christian Grey\\" in my life.<br /><br />The trilogy does start off kinda slow in the first book. It is mainly about hot steamy sex, but book two and three have more of an indepth story line. I literally could not put it down.

B008GFI4KY|5.0|As an avid Darkness fan, I have to say I love the new album.  As an \\"older\\" music listener, I appreciate that they create music worthy of classic rock and roll and not this \\"pre-fab\\" stuff that comes out nowadays.  They are truly musical artists (in my opinion) doing rock and roll the way it should be - using their true talents without the use of all this new technology that can supposedly make anyone (even my dog) sound good recorded.  It's fantastic that they re-united and, when they toured North America in the beginning of 2012, I was lucky enough to see them live in L.A.  They put on a great show and Justin Hawkins'energy is unlimited!

Last week my phone started acting funny and I ended up having to restore it to factory settings and start fresh with my apps.  The first thing I downloaded was this Amazon app. Sadly, the update made it practically unusable for me.  It won't read barcodes at all now which really makes me sad.  I loved that feature most.  I can search but it isn't the same and takes much longer. :(  Come on, Amazon, fix it, please!!  I use an Optimus V...

B005LAIH54|5.0|This is a follow up to the Clash of the Titans, it was a great continuation although it was a great movie on it's own. I like the raw reality of the scenes it had a feel to it of elemental texture. the sea scenes felt like water and the land scenes felt like you were there in the sand and rock. The monsters and super human characters even had a very realness texture to them as if you knew they could exist in their own world. I liked how I was made to sympathize with the Zeus Character as well as the hero.

0525423281|2.0|Slow.<br /><br />Mediocre.<br /><br />Underwhelming.<br /><br />All words that came to mind while reading Lola and the Boy Next Door.<br /><br />I was surprised at how boring I found Lola after reading Anna and the French Kiss, another book by Stephanie Perkins, and absolutely loving it. In a way, they were incredibly similar- both star vibrant, three-dimensional characters; both are contemporary romance; both express infidelity and wrong versus right as major themes. I feel as though Anna and Lola were both walking a fine line between catastrophic and wonderful. Anna kept its balance and turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read in a long, long time. Lola failed.<br /><br />There were a lot of things I didn't like about Lola, but the major issue I had with it were the characters. Perkins is phenomenal at writing realistic, quirky, flawed, and interesting characters that pop off the page, and Lola is no exception. The difference between Anna and Lola, however, is that in Anna, I liked the characters. I could relate to them. I wanted to be their friends. Something about the characters in Anna connected with me. In Lola, there was something that never... clicked. Technically speaking, Perkins did everything right- the characters in Lola and the Boy Next Door should have been just as interesting as the characters in Anna and the French Kiss. They just... weren't. There was something off about them. They bored me. I didn't understand why I should care about their story.<br /><br />Characters don't need to be likeable to be successful. They can be tortured, insane, scary, cruel, arrogant... The list goes on. But there always needs to be something that connects the characters to the readers, and I didn't feel that in Lola. And since Lola is a romance book written for an audience composed of mostly heterosexual, teenage girls, I expected there to be a cute, likable, romantic, crush-worthy boy, akin to St. Clair in Anna and the French Kiss. There wasn't. Perkinsattempted to make the readers fall in love with Cricket the way Lola did, but I never understood his appeal. He bored me. I didn't understand why Lola was in love with him, and I didn't understand why he was in love with Lola. The entire relationship was based off of something that I never understood.<br /><br />Why? I can't figure it out. There was something... off about the entire book, and I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe I was spending too much time comparing it to Anna and expecting it to be as good. Maybe I was expecting something different than Anna, something fresh and original, when Lola turned out to be a sort of cheap knock-off. It kind of felt as though Perkins was trying to recreate her earlier success. It didn't work.<br /><br />There were some things I enjoyed about Lola, but the list is short. I liked Nathan and Andy, Lola's parents. I liked the feministic and pro-gay messages in the book. I liked Calliope Bell, oddly enough. And I absolutely loved seeing Anna and St. Clair from another perspective, in another stage of their lives. Sometimes I think the only reason I kept reading was because I wanted to see more of Anna and St. Clair.<br /><br />Others may enjoy Lola and the Boy Next Door, but it wasn't for me. I'll still read Isla and the Happily Ever After when it comes out and I'll hope it's as as exciting and interesting as Anna, but I think it's clear that Lola will never be considered a favorite of mine.<br /><br />TLDR: Read if you haven't read Anna- you may like it better because you won't be comparing it to Perkins's debut novel. If you have read Anna, feel free to read it, but don't expect anything too original or interesting.<br /><br />More reviews at littlecricketreviews.blogspot.com
0345803507|5.0|Yes, it contain sexual content. But there was an wonderful story line...LOVE all<br />three of these books. Where is my Christian Grey?  Five of my friends were reading<br />this book at the same time....now we are experiencing \\"Fifty Shades\\", withdrawl.<br />So we've decided to have a dinner, to celebrate, in Mr Grey's style along with the<br />Bollinger Champayne.<br /><br />I got past the sexual content, to view the story of Mr. Grey, After everything that<br />happen in this story....he was the surprise..most endearing,afectionate, caring,<br />person.He was unsure of himself. Its been five days since I finished these books, and I still recall moments<br />in the story.  LOVED ALL THREE BOOKS!
0765316897|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has become the new fantasy author we've all been looking for. I had read his Way of Kings novel and wanted to see what else he had written so I decided to start on the Mistborn world. What an imaginative and creative magic system. Such great story development and character development. You find yourself caring about every single character being introduced. With this book specifically I found it was the best in the series. The first novel was a close second, but everything that comes together in this book after the thousands of pages you've read is just so incredibly rewarding, and when you think you have experienced all you can with the satisfaction, Sanderson gives you more and more, giving you things that were always there but you never thought about until he connects the dots. Your brain is making connection after connection, I believe within about an hour I made probably 30 connections that literally gave my brain in expanding in knowledge. I have boughten multiples of these books just so I can give them to friends and make them read this story. I have rethought alot of my life and how I act because of this novel, the same thing happened with the way of kings but i made so many more connections in this trilogy. I cannot wait for the next set of Mistborn books to come out as well as the next Stormlight novel. Sanderson is the new bar that fantasy novels should look to. Perfection.
0345803485|5.0|The book is great! I wish the author would continue the series, I miss reading about Christian and Ana. There could be so many more books! I also received the book in a very timely manner. Thanks Amazon!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Purchased the app for the kids after I saw the demo on the Disney Channel, and after I tried the free version.  Well, lets just say it's so entertaining and addictive for me as an adult, that the kids have no idea it's on the device because I haven't given up the secret yet,  that I purchased it a while ago...I may just remove it from my carousal and hope they don't find it in my apps,  that way I know my high scores are safe.....all in all,  it follows the television show nicely,  and I'm sure when I finally do let the kids on,  they'll drain my battery until I force them outside for real,  active play-time...
0307346617|5.0|I was extremely excited to read this book after hearing about it from friends. I was not disappointed one bit. I love the zombie portrayal and the set up of the book. I love that it's a compilation of stories and the way the book ends is fantastic.

Fans of the old version should certainly consider signing up for the new one (in fact it will remember your previous codes from what their website indicates). If you have never done a personality test or strengths assessment this can be a useful tool to use. However, if you have no intention of implementing this in your company then you will have to decide if identifying your top 5 strengths and having 10 suggestions for behaviour for each is worth the $20 expenditure.  If it is something you are interested in then you should definitely buy it. [[ASIN:159562015X StrengthsFinder 2.0]]
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I was waiting on pins and needles for this book to be released. I really enjoyed the other books in this series and hoped this would be just as enjoyable.<br /><br />And I am pleased to announce that I was not disappointing.<br /><br />Anne Neville was easy to like and I enjoyed our journey together.I really felt that I was able to relate to who she was and what she wanted. At this moment I can't think of anything I didn't enjoy in this book. In fact after reading this book I was finally able to figure out what it was about the Cousin's War series that I have found so intriguing. Ms. Gregory gives us multiple points of view of one particular historical event (The Wars of the Roses).  Just when you think you know who the heroes and Villains are you  read the next book and you find your loyaties shifting. It's not all black and white there are grey areas and I love that.<br /><br />But as for this book...It was moving and powerful. It was a little bit sad but in a really awesome way. The love story between Anne and Richard was endearing. This book made Richard III come alive for me in a way he has not done in the past. I have always been so confused as to what I feel about Richard III, stories on who he was are pretty conflicting. The supernatural elements that was weaved through (the supernatural coming from the Rivers woman) was done well and not at all overwhelming. I was pleased about that.<br /><br />As I have said about every other Philippa Gregory book I have read ...I absolutely would (and have) recommend this book to anyone who loves history and anyone who loves fiction.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really do love this game as well as my husband and daughter. Its very fun and I have never had a problem with it.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, which is more than I can say about Snow White and the Huntsman. Guy Pearce was hysterical, a total smartass thru out the movie. Don't take the movie too seriously and you will have a good time. I happen to like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Evolution, Runaway, and Army of Darkness too. If they appeal to you, so will Lockout. Everyone has an opinion, I happen to like action comedy.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I would give it 5 Stars if I didn't have to buy energy or something all the time. But a great game.
B007SGM084|2.0|Eloisa James has been writing romances for some time and this is another one, just a bit unusual because of the element of sadism/masochism she has added to what is basically a love story.  It's all pretty implausible, however, and frankly I'm not sure what all the excitement is about.  Her female character is rather silly, certainly very naive, and her main male is, of course, gorgeous, masterful (really!), rich, and flawed - very flawed.  Certainly the racy bits are why people are reading these books, but this could be, and has been, done much, much better.  Any female reading it will be inclined, frankly, to laugh a lot at how easily our heroine is aroused and satisfied.  This no doubt is very pleasing to the male readers, but unrealistic if they expect real women to react this way.  This fantasy is so far from reality that it detracts from the story.  There's a LOT of repetition in James' writing and the characters don't have much, well, character!  Overall this trilogy is priced far beyond its worth.

B005CYLSW8|3.0|After Toscanini, Leibowitz, Scherchen, Mackerras, Gielen, Zinman, Norrington(Stuttgart),Harnoncourt,Abbado,Haitink,Fedosseyev and many others, comes once again a Beethoven cycle with modern instruments following the metronome markings of the composer. Some advertisments ridiculously pretend this to be the first cycle ever with these criteria, but the story is very different,and very long.<br />The Gewandhaus plays with great virtuosity, even if they seem to have lost their peculiar rich sound. This could probably be caused by the frenetical tempos which don't allow even to convey much expression to the music, not to say emotion. These performances present Beethoven on a very reduced scale, fatally loosing drama in the third, fifth and ninth in particular.<br />Very attractive recorded sound (louder than the standard) but i would not buy it just for that. The other modern cycles with similar criteria are also very well recorded.<br />With the same orchestra I miss the nobility of Masur (very faithful to the score and not totally disattending the metronome markings) and the grandiloquence of Konwitschny (old fashioned,yes, but very spontaneous and involving). My favourite Beethoven conductor is Asahina whose intense amd monumental readings have the most positive characteristics of Klemperer and Furtwaengler. He recorded six cycles, three of which still available.<br />According to my opinion Chailly made excellent recordings of many other composers (Mendelssohn, Brahms, Dvorak, Bruckner, Mahler, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Messiaen...)but here I am rather disappointed, I find this set just a very refined miniature of Beethoven's symphonism.

0545265355|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins, what can I say but WOW!<br /><br />Since I believe THE HUNGER GAMES came out in 2008, and it is now 2012, you can see I didn't rush right out to read it.  In fact, I refused to get caught up in the hype surrounding the trilogy and the movie release.  Many of my friends were surprised since I am a voracious reader, but I've had no interest in the latest book/movie phenomenons that have flooded the market.  I have NOT read or seen The Lord of the Rings series, The Narnia series, The Harry Potter series, or the Twilight series.  As a rule, I don't like fantasy books, and I especially don't like books with spells, potions, and what I feel are books with cultic overtones.  I know it is a matter of taste and at the root of all these books is the age old clash of good vs. evil, but I've had no interest in them, and it is along these lines that I had wrongly categorized THE HUNGER GAMES.<br /><br />When my co-workers set me straight, and explained the basis for the book, I decided to give it a go.  I was put on a timeline since my co-worker was moving, and I would be borrowing her set of books.  I had about a month to finish the set of three.  Well, once I got into it, book one was finished in just a few evenings, and book two and three were finished in a little over a twenty-four hour period.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM!<br /><br />I think the thing I appreciated about the books the most was the clean language and the absence of sexual content.  Since I usually read Christian fiction, I appreciated a secular book/author that didn't feel the need to throw around off-colored language or gratuitous sex in order to keep their audience entertained.  And, even though there was plenty of violence in these books, I didn't feel that the author used every adjective possible in order to describe the gruesome scenes that played out in the story.  Of course, I realize this book was written for the youth market, but that wouldn't have stopped some authors from feeling they needed to spice up or magnify the realism of today's sex culture.<br /><br />The love triangle Katniss finds herself in is unique.  And though I would've said I don't believe someone can be in love with two people at the same time, you see how easy it can happen considering the circumstances Katniss found herself in.<br /><br />The ending was bittersweet, and I would've liked a little more detail on what happened to each character, but the ending followed suit with the theme of -merely existing-Collins created.rs from feeling they needed to spice up or magnify the realism of today's sex culture.<br /><br />The love triangle Katniss finds herself in is unique.

B005LAIHPY|1.0|I love action movies, I love sci-fi movies, I love awesome special effects movies. I went to see this movie in the theater knowing that it would either be really cool or totally suck. My buddy went with me, he enjoys the same type movies as I do, and usually at least one of us will enjoy a movie, we never both hate a movie - until Battleship. Quite honestly, I was ready to walk out within the first 30 minutes - and frankly, I wish I would have because it never got better. This entire movie was just so incredibly stupid - Taylor Kitsch was both a horrible actor and his character was incredibly stupid. The love affair with the Admiral's daughter was eye-rollingly unbelievable. Quite honestly, the only GOOD part of this movie was Rihanna, her acting was just about better than everyone else's. The only likeable male character was unsensically killed, this role was a total waste for Alexander Skarsgard - he's the one who should have been the hero and main lead. I saw Battle LA in the theater and own it on blu-ray - it's only a so-so movie but it's vastly superior to this garbage which also, amazingly, seemed to have absolutely zero in common with Hasbro's Battleship game. I do believe the ONLY reference to the game was the searchable grid pattern they had to use. Lame. All of it. Don't waste your time or money.

Initially the blood splattered on your screen and the slight gaming like sequences might put you off but hang in there it only gets better.  If you enjoy a real epic journey, filled with love, lust, hatred, treachery and sex, this one is for you.  The sex is basic, graphic and well within the historical timeline.  Get it, watch it and enjoy - I await season 2 with anticipation - so order 1 and 2 at the same time - you will not want to wait!!!!!

1592537251|5.0|I bought this book because I'm interested in the art of Urban Sketching. Its a really cool book and shows sketches from all over the world. The book is broken down by city and shows the work of several Urban Sketchers from around the world. It's pretty neat being able to see all these peoples work in the same book, especially when one of them is my college professor.

0060873027|2.0|Michael Chrichton books have the following in common:<br /><br />- leading edge, believable \\"science\\"<br />- tauntly written<br />- exciting, leading to a suspenseful conclusion<br />- realistic dilemmas<br />- above all, a page-turner that you can't put down.<br /><br />In this case we have<br /><br />- \\"science\\" that causes you to toss out all belief<br />- plodding prose<br />- predictable plot where you can guess very early what is going to happen<br />- the dilemma?  If you think it's realistic, I have a bridge to sell you.<br />- and last of all, I hate to put this book down for not being a page-turner.<br /><br />Go back and read some classic Chrichton.  Andromeda Strain.  Terminal Man.  It just seems like things went downhill after Jurassic Park.  And the posthumous works - Micro, Pirate Latitudes, Timeline - are not up to the quality of the others.

It's not hard but it certainly is challenging as you reach higher levels.  I've cleared my settings and replayed all 600 puzzles since I got it a couple of weeks ago - not because they are simple but because it is that fun and that addictive! Now my only complaint is that 600 puzzles are not enough to be obsessing with. I'd gladly pay for an updated version with more puzzles; can you guys develop that yesterday?<br /><br />Best game for my Kindlefire yet, best replayability, best value, best performance (no force closes, no slow downs, no freeze screens).  I went out and desperately looked for similar type games, found a couple that looked worth dloading, but they didn't hold a candle to this one.  Amazon, your Kindlefire public wants more games like these!!!

B006BAEQB2|5.0|These being part of the cousin serie's it is a must read if you have read \\"The Red Queen\\" or \\"The White Queen\\".  However, this book can stand on it's own and you do not need to read any of the other Cousin Books.  All the Cousin Books can stand on their own!  I loved this book and was glad to spend a few days in pre-tudor England!
B007S7U4AY|5.0|A veces los hijos tienden a olvidar que sus padres tambi&eacute;n fueron j&oacute;venes, se enamoraron, lloraron y sufrieron... Sobre todo cuando se trata de padres que, empe&ntilde;ados en procurar la felicidad de sus hijos, barren su propio dolor y lo esconden debajo de la alfombra. Esto es lo que le ocurre a Mar&iacute;a, la narradora de esta novela, que ya felizmente casada y embarazada, descubre el terrible secreto que han guardado sus padres durante d&eacute;cadas.<br /><br />Elena, la madre de Mar&iacute;a, muere de un ataque al coraz&oacute;n en un avi&oacute;n que la lleva a Nueva York. Ese fatal desenlace pone punto final a una vida de sacrificios que podr&iacute;a haber tenido un final feliz. Una vida que su hija Mar&iacute;a desconoce por completo pero que ir&aacute; desentra&ntilde;ando a partir de una postal encontrada en el bolso de su madre. Con el apoyo y cari&ntilde;o de su marido y la ayuda de un investigador privado va descubriendo una historia triste y hasta violenta, algo que desgraciadamente ocurr&iacute;a a menudo en la &eacute;poca de nuestros padres y abuelos.<br /><br />Me ha gustado mucho porque me interesa el tema de la relaci&oacute;n entre padres e hijos y porque est&aacute; muy bien escrita. La autora sabe transmitir a la perfecci&oacute;n el hecho de que todos somos v&iacute;ctimas de las circunstancias y la &eacute;poca que nos toca vivir. Algunos nos rebelamos, otros no, pero al menos aprendemos de los errores de nuestros padres para no cometer los mismos con nuestros hijos. As&iacute; todos vamos evolucionando para conseguir un mundo mejor. Es una novela intimista que te mantiene en suspense porque Mar&iacute;a va conociendo el pasado de su madre a base de seguir pistas, como en una novela polic&iacute;aca. Es una historia triste que sin embargo termina bien porque en todo siempre hay un halo de esperanza. Adem&aacute;s del feliz acontecimiento del nacimiento de la hija de Mar&iacute;a, el final nos depara otra agradable sorpresa.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app always able to read a verse anywhere anytime and I love the pop up reminder never read the Bible except for some verses but with this I read a whole lot more of gods words
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Very fun game..if you don't like solving puzzles then not your game..love that it isn't easy..recommend highly that you purchase..will give you hours of fun
B007UQRW62|4.0|The Blu Ray Edition of this classic film looks and sounds FANTASTIC. Just wonderful clear picture and great sound. The entire package including the umbrella and book is a beautiful addition to the film. Worth the wait for the 60th anniversary edition. I only wish they had more new features. There is a new documentary which is really nice, but the second disc is the exact special features from the 2002 DVD edition. Otherwise, very worth the buy :)
B007SGM084|5.0|The price for these three books was way cheaper than I could find anywhere else and since this was a purchase to my kindle..it was so quick and easy! What a great concept. I will definitely order books from here again and again and again! Oh and the book is AMAZINGGGGGG
1603429999|5.0|Circular Knitting Workshop is a truly wonderful book, full of patterns that are wearable and beautiful.<br /><br />I finished knitting the Soho Smocked Dress this month -- it took only two months of on-and-off knitting, and it turned out absolutely beautiful.  My college-aged daughter loved the dress, and it fits her fantastically.<br /><br />This is my first experience with top-down knitting, my first experience with a reversible dress pattern, and my first experience with knitting without having to sew seams.  It was a spectacular feeling to bind off the hem of the dress and know that I didn't have to do anything else beyond blocking!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I especially liked how the directions were so easy to understand, and even better, there is a section on how to finish projects off professionally that is worth it's weight in gold!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|these are 101 simple mini games. the physics may be a bit funny here and there and there may be a few too many ads, but for free you really can't beat the variety.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game can't stop playing, its very addicting.. its fun abed entertaining. every chance I get I play.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is my first review.  I was captivated from the beginning to the end!  While there are a few grammatical errors, it does not detract from the story.  I place this among my favorites including Brandon Sanderson and Patrick rothfuss.  Well worth the bargain kindle price!  Can't wait for the next one.
B0034KZE9U|5.0|I'm a server so I'm on my feet for around 5 hours a night and these shoes prevent my feet from ever realizing how long I've been working. They really feel like I'm working in slippers. I've always made fun of people that wear Crocs but after giving in and trying these for working, I am a believer! The one bad side is that these say they're slip resistant but I've slipped many times in the dish area where the floors are always wet. But being cautious around wet floors is definitely worth the comfort.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I have been very dissappointed with the accuracy of this watch. Even when wearing it 24 hours a day, it tends to lose approximately 2 minutes per day. It is also not \\"hackable\\" in that the second hand does not stop when you pull out the crown to set the watch, so you cannot get an exact time set to the second.
0345803485|3.0|Wow. I ordered the trilogy and it's as filthy as everyone said.  I'm halfway through the second book and I see there may be a story to all this.  A good one?  I doubt it.  But, if you're into S&M or need a \\"How-to\\" book - this is what you buy.  There is NO doubt in my mind that the chick that wrote this book has intimate knowledge of this world. It's certainly not my bag, but who I am to judge someone who prefers to be completely dominated by a man....  To each his own.  The book sold as many copies as it did because of all this hooplah surrounding it.  As a read - it sucks regardless of my sexual choices.
B008MEM24S|5.0|my entire family loves this game. it is great for distracting the kids during waits at the doctor or restaurant.  and we all love Perry of course.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but kinda hard to play sometimes but j like it a lot a lot a lot ya so get this game its fun
B008S4YZCO|5.0|fun and entertaining... I loved the graphics also. the game is not too difficult to follow, but its not so simplistic that I could lose intrest
B00783NWB6|4.0|Normally I'd be accused of leaning to the movies that have some theme or ideas and make one think. Think \\"Bicentennial Man\\" or \\"Gattaca\\" or \\"The Matrix\\". Really though, some movies are just fun to watch, have good acting and eye-candy effects, and get you rooting for the hero, or heroine in this case. This is one. The digital download is on my tablet and my PC as well. Easy to pass time watching this again. I'll be adding the earlier one's to my to-buy list too.

B007UW9WOQ|4.0|It was informative with fine filming. It needed more interactive information about his family. His sons were in there but where was Jiro's wife. At the end I felt a little incomplete. Did his wife foster this goal or not? The goal of the father, however, came across loud and clear. I'm glad I saw it. I felt I should look within and check myself out.
0345803485|1.0|This is literally some of the worst writing I have ever read, and that is INCLUDING stuff I come across on the internet written by innocently ignorant pre-adolescents. Bit of background information for anyone considering reading Fifty Shades: This started off as a self-serving Twilight fanfiction, and this author has no respect at all for her readers besides how much money she can make off of them (which in and of itself isn't that bad, I guess). The only thing that has changed in this writing from when it was fanfiction to now being published is the characters' names to make it \\"different\\" from Twilight. Those who have hung around the fanfiction community know the story behind this abhorrent series better than most of the people who like this drivel, but I digress.<br /><br />In short, I would read the entire Twilight series a dozen times over than try to get through the rest of this trilogy--and considering I had to stop reading Twilight by chapter ELEVEN because I was laughing so hard in disbelief, you can see how that would possibly give me a brain aneurysm. The only reason I read as much of Fifty Shades as I did (didn't even finish it as I've wasted enough time on this crap) is so I know what I'm dealing with when educating other people about the follies of this series. I can't tell people not to read something I haven't read for myself--okay, maybe I can. Probably I should have. Anyway.<br /><br />Let's start with what's wrong with the characters. The main character Anastasia, who goes by the nickname \\"Ana\\" just like the main character from Twilight prefers \\"Bella\\" to \\"Isabella,\\" has literally one of the worst personalities any writer can give a female main character (I can't even use the term heroine to describe her since that is a disservice to the word--also it sounds too close to heroin, and suddenly I'm back to remembering Twilight and my time doing clinicals in a drug abuse recovery facility). I'm not talking about how she can't walk through a door without face-planting onto the carpet (and yet can somehow go an entire night wearing stilettos without incident). I'm talking about how she has little to no self-esteem or self-respect, and how she's perfectly willing to take the blame for every little thing the main leading male character throws at her. I've tried to think of a way to make this funny since humor is my natural response to stupid, but I just can't. That's like joking at the Holocaust or the Haiti earthquake. You can do it, but if you're a decent human being, then it makes you feel a little sick inside.<br /><br />Christian is...I don't even know how to explain him without gagging. I'm calling BS on the whole \\"tortured past\\" thing, by the way. This in no way is an excuse for how terrible and abusive a person he is. EVERYTHING is Ana's fault. He takes absolutely zero responsibility for anything that happens--he might say he does, but just wait a few sentences and oh, guess what, it's Ana's fault after all! I mean, he practically stalks her relentlessly (well hello there Edward) until she agrees to sign his BDSM contract (which, if you forget what's in it, shows up A DOZEN TIMES SO YOU DON'T FORGET BECAUSE HOW DARE YOU), and then he completely ignores any issues she has and practically drags her into it, only to blame her when she suffers from not following it because, I don't know, maybe this is NEW to her and it takes a little longer than a few days to get comfortable with such an extreme lifestyle? (BTW, do NOT take anything in this book as being legit BDSM lifestyle.) His controlling behavior in and of itself could work in a character if it's recognized for what it is and not passed off as a \\"oh he cares and wuvs her so so much and that is so so cute!!!!!\\"<br /><br />Okay, I know that the whole point of this book...or something (lol there's a quote for you) is that Ana is supposed to be this \\"oh so strong and ah-mazing\\" female character who saves the \\"dark and brooding oh so hawt\\" male character from his \\"dark and brooding oh so hawt\\" self. In the end, it ends up being a pathetically immature and weak little girl who lets people walk all over her and who apparently has no social life (even I have a social life, and I spend a good chunk of my time gaming, working, going to school, and dabbling in somewhat weird hobbies) absolutely obsessing over a man who treats her like crap and obviously needs a zillion hours of psych help and maybe his own personal island where he can do...whatever it is he's doing to make so much money because it obviously isn't working. He must own a bunch of gnomes or something. Or maybe he's got dirt on every major CEO in the world. Or maybe he has money trees. I don't know.<br /><br />Okay, I'm done ranting now. If you read this far, you're as crazy as I am, and I applaud you.<br /><br />TL;DR: The characters are weak in every way, the plot is appallingly anti-women, and OH MY I've seen better writing from both my English as a second language AND remedial English college students.
145470246X|5.0|Beautiful colors. Every pattern are clearly explained.I love this book.<br />I want to make one of each piece at least.
0439023521|5.0|I'll admit that I had to give this book a second chance. I started reading it long before the movie announcement to see what all the hype was from my friends, but I just couldn't enjoy the first chapter. It just seemed so super boring and dull after all I'd been told to expect, and I haven't read a book in first person present tense for fun before, so add that together, and I stopped reading before I ever got started.<br /><br />After the movie was announced in full production, my friends convinced me to give it another try. I pretty much skipped to the end of the first chapter after skimming through it as much as possible, and after a few pages, I managed to get into the writing style. I greatly enjoyed it. You have to remember that this is told from first person, and first person narratives will always be biased as they should be, and with that in mind, this is a pretty awesome book (bad wording, I know, but it's really great, okay). I liked the characters and the fact that the author has no problem making her main character pretty much a jerk. I enjoyed the often simple writing and the fact that the pace overall kept going and going fairly smoothly. I'm glad I gave this book a second chance.
1416562605|3.0|I've read quite a few Indian authors over the last couple of years, but there was something about this one that I just didn't connect with. I like the format of writing a letter to tell the story and it flowed well, but it didn't grab me.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I recently came across another reference to 'Belly Fat' which also dealt with this issue. But the specific reference to wheat in this book really sparked my interest. Wheat is found in so many products these days.<br /><br />The views expressed are certainly not main stream at the moment. But Dr Davis' views are well supported by facts and references that appear to have substance. Although I have not finished the text it certainly has merit for many of those looking for a solution to our current overweight problems.<br /><br />Removing wheat from one's diet will be a big challenge but if his thesis is correct it might just be a lifesaver.<br /><br />And I like the fact that Dr Davis recommends a shopping technique I have heard before - shop around the perimeter of the supermarket (vegetables, dairy and meat) and avoiding all the processed foods in the center aisles.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000VMFDR2 In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto]]

0449012751|5.0|With 98 customer reviews, nobody needs another.  Still, I am so grateful for the emotional feast and the uplifting poetry of timing and plot of this book, I want to add a comment.  I find I can and do listen successfully in the car while driving.  I am a 72 year old retiree who finds the book and the excellent narration by Jim Broadbent startlingly beautiful.  The story is structured in such a way that we get a chance to think about childhood, courtship, young married life, middle age, aging, sociality, solitude, nature, and death in as insightful and accurate way as seems possible.  One of the other reviewers said, \\"I'm telling you: I love this book.\\"  I feel just that way. For the sake of a good life for us all, I hope Rachel Joyce is nearly finished with another book.
B008DVJMAW|4.0|This Band is over the top plan jane goood!!.It`s got a Little Touch of skynyrd! and a little mix of country ( not this today country but more like the 80`s outlaw country).I like just about all the song`s on here. The one that i love is SLEEPING DOGS!!. If you like that late 70`s sound this cd is for you!. I am going too buy some more of there cd`s soon hey you just can`t beat it. Good band`s are hard to find this day and time untill now!! BLACKBERRY SMOKE WILL LIVE ON IN MY CD PLAYER!! THANK YOU.

Please make sure and pich up both of Puscifer's cd's also, v is for you know and Conditions of my Parole.  I am lucky enough to live in Prescott AZ so I am close to where they record this gold.  This is what your ears where made for along with your childs asking for food or love.....:)

B000JMKTLO|4.0|While Flynn's second and third novels (Dark Places and Gone Girl) felt like mysteries, Sharp Objects feels more like a mixture of noir, Desperate Housewives, melodrama, and Gothic novel, and the end result is never less than entertaining, even as you're recognizing how over-the-top all of it is. In Sharp Objects, a newspaper reporter returns to her hometown to investigate what looks to be a series of murdered children. But while the dead children are never far from the story, Sharp Places is more focused on our intrepid and deeply damaged reporter, whose return to her hometown also returns her to her toxic family and her monstrous mother, and the scars of her past - scars that turn out to have a disturbing physical counterpart - start getting peeled back. Much like Flynn's later books, Sharp Objects revolves more around its characters and their inner lives than the mystery, all while doing a good job of juggling the two aspects beautifully. Here, though, Flynn indulges a sense of the theatrical and the melodramatic, diving into bitchy socialite gatherings, chillingly mature teenage cruelty, a frank exploration of female sexuality, and a mother whose casual cruelty makes her unforgettable. Sharp Objects is definitely the weakest of Flynn's three novels, but that in no way makes it bad; in fact, it's still a gleefully poisonous pill that features great characterization, a memorably twisty plot, and Flynn's knack for writing. At the same time, it's also her first novel, and while it's great that she started off strong, it's even better that she improves with each successive work. After reading all three of these, the only thing I regret is not having any more to read right now. Hopefully book number four is soon to come; whenever it does, I'll definitely be there.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I played this game. and bet the game 3 times so you should get this game is soooooo fun hope you like this game and if you find more of my review. I love to say cookie. !!!!
1451627297|5.0|I do believe that some of the reviewers here need to lighten up a bit. This book is what it is: a good story. Also a fun read. It kept my interest and got me thinking about the nature of history and to what extent our actions can effect it. If one isn't able to suspend judgement to immerse oneself in something, what's the point? That's what life is all about.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|I'm a fan of both main characters but I didn't expect much since there's not much buzz about this movie but man, was I wrong. It's one of the best suspense/thriller movies I've seen recently. The plot is not perfect but it didn't give up much throughout the film. It's one of the BEST performance from Ryan Reynolds or any action actors for that matter - either he's that good or the role really fits him well. Denzel is as usual...superb.<br /><br />4.5 stars but give 5 since not many good action movies lately.
B000TU16GS|5.0|i couldn't put the book down! It will keep you reading, and ready for more! .You will love it! I highly reccomend it.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|I try to imagine this movie without Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, and Lenny Kravitz and suddenly it comes closer to becoming unwatchable. The production design was uninspired and the costumes/makeup were insipid (could have borrowed from \\"The Fifth Element\\" Anyone? Anyone?). What was the shakey-cam for? Finally, 2 hours-plus seems a long time to spend on such a weak story. \\"Running Man\\" and \\"Logan'S Run\\" bear some similarities but give the viewer more story and more entertainment.
B0055SWM08|4.0|A relaxing game even when you come across a puzzle that is tough to solve.  The music is soothing and the movement of the graphics is slow and smooth.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I love this app and all my other story apps, but the glitches with not receiving rewards and money for food are getting very annoying and starting to be a big waste of my time. If I'm not going to make money that I earned, then why play at all? The prices for walls and floors are ridiculous as well. But that's a moot point when you're not receiving money that's rightfully yours. PLEASE fix these glitches in ALL story apps so I can get back to enjoying my games again. Thanx!!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Good fun. The layout is very helpful in gameplay. Easy to use app perfect for those looking to kill time.
B005HXGEDC|5.0|This is a brilliant CD. A very good continuation of the 'scratch my back'-project. The only thing I don't really understand is the silence prior to Solsbury Hill.
B005RUV714|4.0|Better than Season 1 trailer. It had more relevant background music. This apocalyptic scenario is serious and ominous too. It has a lot of unknowns and dangers. The background music really makes the trailers.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The game is great at first...until you try to upgrade or take advantage of one of the advertised specials like a free upgrade.  If you are playing this on the kindle fire and expecting the same version you've seen on the ipod or other apple products, you're going to be very disappointed. This version has far less features and constantly has loading issues.<br /><br />Also, if you want to purchase more coins to get bombs or colors there is a huge issue with the game not recognizing your purchase, YET YOU STILL GET CHARGED. Trying to email the developer and all they want you to do is force close the app and uninstall and reinstall the app several times.  You shouldn't have to do this after a purchase, esp if another lesser purchase shows up just fine.<br /><br />Customer Service from developer is appalling. just an nonlinear forum basically where other users can try to help you. I'm not opposed to help from other users but when it comes to a purchased item, id rather deal with the company directly.<br /><br />if the developer can fix these issues, ill change my rating but for now it is what it is.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I have bought the Season 2. Season 1 was very good, but Season 2 knocks that one out. I have review some of the videos of Season 3 and I can see where that is going too... out of the park. But it needs to retain the old characters, like Rick, Daryl, Adria, Carol, Lori, Carl, the vet, Maggie, Glenn...they are strong leader-like characters. For instance:<br /><br />1) Daryl: he can evolve into the lead of searching for lost people, stealth attacks on the W/D, still a loner, develop a positive relationship with Carol, etc., he shoots first and asks questions later.<br />2) Rick: he can still maintain the leadership role, due to his compassion and matter-of-fact demeanor, needs to develop a more \\"kick ass\\" attitude too. I think Season 3 we will see that happen, especially with the secure prison environment, etc. He will have to kick ass more, especially with the incurrence of the new \\"governor\\" coming on the scene.<br />3) Lori: she needs to get in the program and support Rick and don't argue and be such a nemesis to Rick, she is the \\"first lady\\" so to speak to the leader, needs to support Rick more and stand behind him.<br />4) Carol: Daryl needs to take control of this woman. She is so use to being abused by her prior husband, she really feels like she is wanted when she is abuse, verbally and physically. She shows some selfish tendencies. She needs some sex to straighten her out.<br />5) The Vet: he will be the group doctor and support for Rick in the leadership area.<br />6) Glenn: He needs to gets some \\"balls\\" with his abilities and knowledge-base and Maggie needs to step up and support him; he is a good and compassionate leader that will help to support Rick.<br />7) Maggie: needs to support Glenn more and step up with her abilities, i.e., nursing, fighting, guns, whatever.<br />8) Carl: he is very good...he is developing a very good pragmatic attitude, like Daryl...shoot and ask questions later.<br />9) Adria: she is developing a more military bearing like Daryl.<br /><br />Maggie's sister needs to let out to the Walkers. She is useless...like another unsupportive, whiny, child.<br /><br />The Mishon character will be a great asset to the group, especially if she teaches her skills to Adria and others.<br /><br />Basically, the group needs to be on the same page in their mission...SURVIVAL! They need to start grouping food, gathering munitions, food stuff, weapons, building secure housing, fortifying the housing area, building weapons, developing a medical system, providing a commodity for the survivors, and developing a monetary system.<br /><br />Need a replacement for dead deputy...without the thinking with his genitals.<br /><br />Personally, I am a survivalist. I think outside the box and develop the \\"what if\\" scenarios. I would develop systems to fix the probable problems that would occur in such an apocalyptic scenario.

B003DRWX9I|5.0|Wow! I always knew Slash could grind an axe, but I never knew just how much versatility he had. He has grown immensely as a musician since his GnR days. I was floored by almost every track on this record. Each song has its own power, excitement, and energy. All of the guest vocalists put forth incredible efforts. An utterly brilliant album.
1400069289|4.0|By showing how you can identify your triggers and reinforce positive actions to create new habits, this book is great for creating or changing habits. This book has helped me make some changes: watching less tv, being more consistent with my running (doing a 10k in the fall), and developing better eating habits.  It's quite a read (lots of science) -Duhigg does a great job of making the science really relatable.  It reads like a narrative rather than a textbook.  If you need to change some habits, this is a great book to get you started.

B0090EIILU|4.0|This is a very funny movie that points out some of the problems with our country.  It is not for people who do not have a sense of humor, and it is pretty crude, as expected.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I play this game a lot so I love it its like the best app there is take itftom me a person who is in love with the game.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it is nice to see actual percent number and know how many estimated minutes left...i think it is a good app
B008S4YZCO|5.0|i love this game. the graphics remind me of a zelda games graphics. it is a very interactive game. dosnt get boring and cqn be played over a long period of time.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|It's a case.  And, like all other gopro products/accessories, works as expected and is of high quality.  This allows easy access to the a/v ports in the gopro.  But, if you are using it where there is a lot of wind, you will get increased wind noise.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app that has ads that do not distract. perfect alternative to paid apps. It is simple and a breeze to use.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  The missions give this game an edge over similar games.  I am never bored with it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is one of the most fun games that I am playing on my Kindle Fire.  You play with your friends.  You draw something and they try to guess what it is.  Then they draw and you guess.  It's hysterical, especially if you are a terrible artist, like I am.  It's a real hoot!
0062011847|4.0|Despite the changes in writing style, he is dictating his work to his assistant, I thought this book was still excellent. I especially liked how again this book like so many before highlights refermeces to our own world.  This one being slavery, genocide and racism or in this case specieism.<br /><br />I know that the discworld series will be concluding shortly especially as Terry's last two books the long earth and dodger are not discworld books.<br />Lets just enjoy the discworld while we can.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|terrible unreliability on the Kindle,  crashed constantly. that problem is exacerbated by vevo blocking users from viewing their videos through youtube on mobile devices

0345803485|1.0|Vapid, unerotic, and a waste of the paper on which it was printed. Save your money..don't give the publisher or author one more undeserved penny.
0061367036|5.0|It came in the mail a few days earlier then it said it would. Perfect condition. I love the information so far, and I can picture the Winchester boys sitting down to write this book. A must have for not only Supernatural fans, but anyone interested in lore.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|DIDNT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN IT WAS SO CAPTIVATING, I EVEN TOOK IT ON VACATION IF THAT SAYS ANYTHING = ) SIGNED RP
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was great, I love being able to watch Christian mature into a strong and enviable lover. He really became the man every woman dreamed encountering, handsome, rich, and ultimately changed for the sake of the one he loves. But not entirely changed, just his heart and what it takes to keept Ana by his side.
B003EYVXV4|3.0|Got to chapter 14, then froze up.. was good up till that point. Tried in 3 dvd players... bad disk.<br /><br />Though the movie starts out a little confusing. It pulls its self together throughout.<br />Characters are enjoyable and memorable. The environment feels real and believable.<br /><br />The movie is enjoyable, but the manufacture needs to due a better job with quality control.<br />Due to that, I gave it a lower score then normal.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|This movie is very emotional and a great watch if you're up for a good cry or if you just need to get some perspective in life. Overall, a very good movie. ;)
B005RZ8WIA|5.0|[[ASIN:B005RZ8WIA Live from Beyond Hell / Above Heaven]]<br />Awesome Band, Great album, Great price.<br />A must have for Volbeat fans.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my friends say it's a good app should i get it.what do you do exactly it looks fun.like dk u trace stuff.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Great series one of the best shows that was ever on television. It should have never been taken off the air. Much better then the New Generation One.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Using Kindle, it's simple and easy to use as you scroll reading through the pages.  The next best thing going to buy the book in a store. Just download based on the type of phone you have and there you have it.
B005USZYDU|2.0|Most of the book was fast paced action, or interesting court battles. In the end, when theodore is potentially beating the bad character, or the murderer, the story ends. The horrible ending is why this book is rated two stars.
B0088D076I|5.0|Fans of Luca and Rhapsody of fire will be happy to know that this solo album has all of what you know and love from this artist, from frantic fret work to soaring symphonic sounds, this work will be a strong addition to your collection.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Halfbrick did it again, I play on my kindle fire, but theres a bug.  The game speeds up as soon as he swipes the jetpack and I cant move up or down. Please fix!
B008D28HYS|2.0|Enjoyed the first few puzzles and completed them.  Then the grids became large with tiny little cells which were hard to fit my finger on.  The numbers along the sides were also small and hard to read.  The later puzzles were not fun at all.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a nice city game. it keeps you entertained and the game has good graphics. good game play. nice big map area.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a good summer read.  An upscale harlequin romance type novel.  The sex part was not that interesting but the relationship dynamic was.  By far not an intellectual book but entertaining none the less.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it! I play it all the time. I just wish they had a log in or something, because I unlocked a whole bunch of stuff on my phone but I cant access them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun and its really nice way to pass the time while you're waiting for something. The clean lines and subtle sounds are pleasing.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved them all. Very good read for anyone. The characters come to live and will make you laugh, cry and love them.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is an amazing substitute for world of warcraft it a lil less detailed in primary secondary skill and jobs but it gets the job done. i love this game and there are supossed to be some pretty awesome patches coming up.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I like Angry Birds Space, but I do NOT like the progress-deleting updates. Fix that, and this game will be five stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game app will keep you busy and untreated because there are so many games and you have to play to unlock others. some games are more challenging then others.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun, there are tons of games worth trying. however you have to work for money to open up games. some may cost more some may cost less. enjoy
030758836X|4.0|Had to give this book 4 stars for the quality of the writing, the strong characterization and the clever and creative plot. As the review title suggests, many people felt severe disappointment about the ending. I took a star away since the unnatural method used to create a major element of that ending is a bit contrived but I felt the ending \\"fit\\" the story and the personalities of the protagonists. And no, I don't feel a story of this type has to end with justice for all concerned. I feel that the resolution (or lack thereof) is probably more realistic. Probably one of my better reads in 2012.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|best game ever fun for kids and audlts. I loved it the little monsters are so cute and the game is free.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its like frontierville but slightly  better. the game is very responsive and the loading times are short.  some of the mission take a while to complete but they throw in small one to keep you busy
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really like the book it was easy to read and flowed very well. I would recommend this book to others.
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|The brain That Changes Itself is my book of the year. It's fascinating & informative, as well as being 'a good read' - enjoyable & relevant - I'd recommend it to everyone I know.
0316098329|1.0|After all the positives from reviewers and reading friends, I really wanted to like this novel. But I couldn't get past the first 20 pages--and even that was a struggle.<br /><br />I wasn't repelled by this novel's subject matter--which is clearly borrowed from real life and topical events--but the gimmicky way in which this book is set up and written. The five-year-old's voice and point of view is downright annoying, and this contrivance stands between me as the reader and the actual story. As annoying as it was, I might have suffered through the voice if it had remained authentic, but even in my short read, there were many instances in which the voice slipped into terminology and vocabulary that are just not those of a little boy--even a precocious one.<br /><br />Again, I would have liked to have liked this book, but what might have been a good story was obscured by this commercially-motivated, gimmicky set up of the little boy telling the story--badly.
B003V924JC|5.0|'just as an 'FYI', THIS particular blu ray -note cover- has only the 9 min director's interview as sole extra: it does NOT have any of the other extras as listed elsewhere (incl. 45 min 'making of') on other releases. Love the film (Terry Gilliam-esque), and blu really shines; my ONLY quibble (aside from lack of extras) is that as you have to read english subtitles, you are not able to catch all of the lovely/quirky sets, subtle acting nuances, etc. One of those films that I can easily watch back-to-back!
B004QL7K6G|1.0|I had to stop the movie about fifty minutes in, I was actually becoming embarrassed for the actors, especially Theroux, his character was the cringeworthiest.  The movie is great for film students wanting to learn how NOT to portray a romantic interest, because they made Theroux so foolish that I can't imagine how he'll receive future roles or be considered attractive.  Or maybe I'm wrong, Aniston seems to star in failure after failure and works steadily, so....<br /><br />Very, very unfunny and just plain strange movie, its shocking that they released it at all.  And, though I was pleasantly surprised to see a few of the cast members from the ancient MTV comedy show The State (which I enjoyed, I think I was the only one), I know that movies which they star in are usually not so great, so I was immediately suspicious, and my suspicions were correct.<br /><br />I have no idea if they--The State members, wrote the script, and I don't even care enough to find out, but I will tell you this; I truly could have gone without seeing one of The State members in full frontal nudity scenes, I'm not prudishly opposed to nudity, I just don't want to see him naked, thank you very much, its just too weird.  And finally, it was hard to watch an incredible actor like Alan Alda in this film, for a lot of reasons.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app its the best in the world I use it in Sunday school all the time y'all should really get this app :)
0345803485|4.0|Of course this is a work of fiction so some latitude is granted.  As \\"romance\\" novels go, this series is fulfilling and very spicy.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|As a business book junkie. I loved this one. If you have trouble moving from owning your job to owning a business, it's worth a read.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought this book because it was on the top ten list and the subject type I enjoy reading. It was very slow to start, but picked up really well about a third of the way in. I was totally hooked until the ending. SUCH a disapointment!!
1934030198|5.0|this is really a must buy- especially as a good explanation of how, what, why, & safety issues.  It is written with a voice of reason and sensibility since this activity attracts maniacs (me).
B005HJWWW8|2.0|My biggest complaint with this unit is the battery life.  The description says \\"Built-in rechargeable battery provides up to 10 hours of normal use.\\"  I guess the key words are UP TO 10 HOURS because I've been lucky to get 3 hours out of it after charging overnight.  I am hard of hearing and notice a good difference while using this.  If the battery was better I would gladly give it 5 stars, but the short battery life is a major downfall.
044655667X|4.0|Dealing with quite possibly the most irritating and obnoxious client ever, Micky Haller is out to create reasonable doubt that the grating twit he's representing didn't kill a banker. Most of the action in this book is either in the courtroom or in Micky's office, making it almost into the kinds of courtroom dramas I don't like to read, however, I enjoy this character enough that I'm willing to suffer the transcript-like places where the direct and cross leave me sort of glazed over.<br /><br />I like Micky and it was nice to see him again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a game. A game is a game. If u ask me. I guess its ok. its not bad but its kinda boring at times
B0063IH60K|4.0|pretty much exactly what you want from a solitar app. ads are annoying a times and no social networking value added.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|DO NOT BUY IT!!! I'M DEAD SERIOUS!! If you want a CD by a female rapper, I would suggest you go buy something by for example MC Trouble, MC Lyte, H.W.A., Menajahtwa, The Conscious Daughters or maybe Nikki D! Just stay far far away from this!!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|[[ASIN:B002DHACT2 The Great Indian Wars: 1540-1890]]I found \\"War Horse\\" to be believable, unembarasing, engaging, and thoroughly enjoyable! Script, scenes and dialog will suit all horse lovers; be they children, teen-agers or adults.
B008OOYALE|1.0|why does this game such so bad. It looks good but it so bad. why why why why why why.
034580404X|4.0|I bit the bullet and decided to jump on the \\"Shades of Grey\\" bandwagon. Much like Twilight, I attempted to avoid the hype but eventually succumbed to the peer pressure.<br /><br />Let's just say, I do not regret it. I thought (given my history of African American romance novels), that the erotica stigma placed on this book would overshadow any true story line. However, I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Christian's character was well developed, I loved how his story unfolded. It was a surprise considering how he was painted as the man who had it all initially.<br /><br />Sure enough the book does center around the romantic exploits of Anna and Christian, but I think the secret of what their doing adds to the story. The fantasy nature of their relationship is very reminiscent of Twilight's Bella and Edward relationship. Some would say that is the detriment of the story. However, if you look for romance novels to take you into a fantasy space rather than having an overdose of realism, then this will be a good read.<br /><br />I read the entire series over the course of 2.5wks. So, I can say that it keeps you engaged. I wouldn't say that it's the most well written of all the books I've ever read but it's still a good read. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a passive read.<br /><br />P.S. My favorite part of the story had to be their blackberry and email conversations.
B0086700CM|4.0|very good game it is very fun and I like it a lot but I wish I could play lo
B008D28HYS|4.0|This is a great game with a new twist.  You have to rethink your game play if you played the original CrossMe.  I love this game even more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is deservedly a best seller.  Don't miss this cruise through a marriage in a mess.  Full of twists and turns and reversals, it reminded me that other people's marriages are indeed a mystery.  The characters are unforgettable, and down the road you will idly wonder about how it all worked out.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|You have to watch this show<br />excellent cast and storyline.<br />Best writers and directors .. I know beauty is in the...well if you don't like this, might as well be blind. all im saying<br /><br />Plus, if you don't have picture perfect photographic memory.. you have to re-watch the seasons.. everything is tide.. because time a a big bowl of timey-wimey-wibbley-wobbley things..
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is a book that grabs you from the first paragraph and never lets go.  This woman's ill-conceived yet daring trek on the Pacific Coast Trail will thrill you, horrify you but engage you with every turn of the trail.  A book that takes you out of yourself and into a new place and experience.  Sometimes unbearably sad, often shocking, and screamingly funny, you have to love it.
B008FOB124|5.0|I own every Dead Can Dance album. This is by far one of their most polished works. Rich, deep, and powerful. Every song is unique and breathtaking. This album is classic. Each listen unveils a layer unseen from the last visit. Return of The She King is Magnum Opus of the Album (for me), but don't take my word for it. You won't be disappointed. This album is by far the best albums I have heard in a long, long, long time. Music is my life, but DCD is in my top ten. Few albums give you the feeling that your thankful to be alive and being able to experience and listen to an album...this is one for me...
B004UQ03P2|5.0|Purchased recently and couldn't be happier. The screen speckling is not as bad as others say. It is somewhat noticeable when I'm hunched down, looking at the laptop. However, it was well worth it.<br /><br />The screen protector covers the entire screen and border, and reduces glare significantly. Bear in mind that it does not eliminate glare, only severely limits it. This can be seen by looking at the opening for the camera at the top. From the looks of it, the old screen had so much glare that the oval area around the camera looks like a camera lens itself. The material appears to be of relatively high quality. The new screen is no longer a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze. As others have pointed out, only the borders are sticky. This and perhaps the \\"Splash Masque HD\\" others have noted (which I have not tried) are the only screen protectors worth trying. They have lower chances for error, and the smooth texture of anti-glare protectors feel amazing. I cleaned the screen with a very good screen cleaner cloth, yet dust particles still attached. It seemed almost inevitable that some stray, miniscule fragment of dust would attach to the screen. After accepting my fate (and the fact that the protector was reusable) I placed the protector. It turns out, since this product does not bubble, the dust was unnoticeable. I could not longer find the really tiny specs of dust!<br /><br />Some things to note: The protector does reduce the brightness of the screen by a little, but I have adjusted within an hour of use. There is a slight loss in the viewing angle for this device, I'd say roughly 10 percent, but looking at the screen at these angles would be an inconvenience regardless of whether or not there was a screen protector.<br /><br />All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />[Shortened version:]<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Reduces, but not eliminates, glare<br />-Smooth texture of screen<br />-No longer a fingerprint magnet<br />-Protects screen? (This is not really necessary, as the screen is already protected by a large slab of glass) (however, it would protect the screen from fingerprint oils on the keyboard cover)<br />-Reusable<br />-More forgiving application<br /><br />CONS:<br />-slight loss of viewing angle<br />-slight speckling<br />-slight brightness loss<br /><br />[Other things to note:]<br />-I initially did not care much for the included screen cleaner, and used my own.<br />-Running the ColorSync utility included with OSX helps tweak the screen to fit the protector better. I ran it 5 minutes after applying the screen protector, and the colors no longer look as \\"washed out.\\" This is why I did not really consider mentioning it for the review
B007MNV5WU|3.0|really u have to pay for it wat does this have that the other angry birds don't have someone please tell me I love this game but my opinion is that it should be free
B004HD61KE|5.0|A continuation of Sigma adventures.  An easy to read page turner to see what fast action will ocurr next.  I can't wait for more advenures.
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|I really loved this movie, and so did my 11-year-old daughter ... this is truly one of the great movies of all time. Of course it's not quite as long as the book, but the book was written in a time when people had almost no entertainment, and would spend several hours a day reading. These are different times, and this movie is perfect for our times - even though it is older than I am!
B003L77G8I|5.0|We enjoy this show and are pleasantly surprised on the different story lines they are able to come up with to keep our interest.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|this game was perfect until the superpowers came. now whenever a play a level it wont even load and it crashes!!! really dissapointing..going to have to uninstall it
B002JVWR4A|5.0|we love watching the show including the reruns...when we travel we bring along the dvds to watch on vacations or if there is nothing else on tv that we want to watch.
B000B589JI|5.0|This is a nifty little backup for your Zippo lighter. Very well constructed and made all of aluminum. Holds enough extra fluid and an extra flint or two. If you go through your fluid a lot and don't want to carry around a container of lighter fluid, I highly recommend this item. Clips on your belt loop and is readily available when needed. Great item.....<br />UPDATE...THE CLIP THAT ALLOWS THIS TO HANG ON YOUR KEY CHAIN HAS BROKEN. i HAVE NO OTHER WAY OF KEEPING THIS ON ME NOW EXCEPT TO KEEP IT IN MY POCKET WHICH I DONT SUGGEST. A BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BUT ITS BEEN LONGER THAN 30DAYS AND NOW I CANT RETURN IT.
B003L77GGK|5.0|It is much different from other shows of this nature and keeps me interested into the next season.  I always look forward to watching.
B005LAIGKU|2.0|Premium Rush is a tonally-confused, poorly-written summer spectacle that will leave most mature audience members wanting more. Thirteen year old boys, on the other hand, should have no trouble getting amped up over the action...but maybe they shouldn't. The film presents negative racial and gender stereotypes in strikingly non-chalant fashion. More on that in a moment. First you ought to know that the plot is cardboard thin: a one-dimensional tough-guy bicycle delivery rider (played by a sleepwalking (or riding) Joseph Gordon Levitt) is targeted by a lowlife cop (the type-casted psychotic Michael Shannon) because he picks up a package worth quite a bit of money. Cue the chase scenes, which are admittedly pretty entertaining with convincing CGI for the most part.<br />The problem is the script which is peppered with an ungodly amount of flashbacks, super expository narration, a frame narrative that loops back on itself with twenty minutes left in the movie, and character so paper-thin that you will never remember them when the credits roll. Take Willie, our ostensible hero, his one and only defining characteristic is that he likes to ride his bike with no brakes! Woah, so symbolic. Spare me. Oh yeah and Teenage Wasteland plays as a book-end device.... how clever! It is also worth noting that the film is incredibly sexist and racist, as well. Though it includes a number of female and ethnically diverse characters, these folks are given very little to do. The black guy, for example, is presently as a cartoonish villain with no real redeeming qualities other than his muscles. And the Asian character is given nothing to do but mourn for a family member and get choked by another character in a ruthless intimidation scene that seems entirely out of place in an otherwise jaunty summer flick. Why even put that scene in there, one wonders, other than to feed helpless female stereotypes. Ultimately, Premium Rush is like riding an aesthetically pleasing bike with a chronicallyflat tire-- no matter how hard you hit the turns, you'll still be left wishing for a much more finely-tuned experience.
B000JSI79O|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the series and always looked forward to the next one.  It was a refreshing different twist on an old favorite.
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|The four violin concertos gathered by Vivaldi under the title The Four Seasons are indisputably some of the most beloved pieces for violin and orchestra in the history of music. The audiences around the world are happy to rediscover the pre-classical beauties inculcated by the Italian maestro in these melodic and rhythmic jewels of the concertante literature. Therefore, every violinist feels himself/herself entitled to tackle Vivaldi’s treasure and try to find his/her own way to recreate it.<br /><br />The beautiful and talented young Dutch Janine Jansen says in the liner notes of this recording that for her the feeling and its intensity is the most important achievement of music making. I dare say that it is quite this feature that makes her recorded account of The Seasons so appealing. Mastering a flawless technique of the violin, convincingly betting on the feeling-transmission and knowing very well what a wealthy amount of musicality swarms these scores, Janine Jansen goes to the very essence of the music. The orchestra is reduced to a few chamber players, thus every compartment getting a higher importance. Along with her brother (Morten) and father (Jan), among the players we encounter Julian Rachlin (viola)!!!<br /><br />The overall result is an enjoyable version of Vivaldi’s masterpiece in a minimal cast, but with maximal efficiency in musical terms.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|A different twist on dissaster movies.  It was action packed through out most of the movie, however, it was quite long.  I enjoyed the movie for the most part.
8866131105|5.0|It's my second Moleskine daily planner. I like that it actually has a page for each day (with date on it)and I can use it as a diary book and write down every. Some diary books only has 200 pages which is NOT ok for 365 days but this one has all the days.<br /><br />It's very durable as well.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|The band simply known as 'Fun' sound a bit different. They draw on a diverse set of influences.<br /><br />It begins with the two-fer Some Nights. It sounds a bit like (or a lot like) the 70's rock icons Queen. I don't really like these songs because they sound rather screwball and mental. 'We are young' is the big single for these guys. It has the modern assonance, as all modern hits do, where they keep repeating a vowel sound over and over in the hope of jamming it into your head. On 'We are young' they 'i' seems to keep being repeated during the chorus. At first this put me off the song, but gradually I've come to appreciate it as 'updated pomp-rock' or something. And besides, through the ages guys have had 'get-me-laid' songs. In the olden days, it was pretty simple 'I love you' stuff, then the Blues artists mixed in double entendre's usually involving an animal, then throughout the 70's and 80's it was outrageous boasting, but nowadays it's faux sensitivity, like 'if... you feel like falling down I'll carry you home tonight', or boastfulness hidden in metaphores, such as 'Set the world on fire'.<br /><br />'Carry On' comes next. This continues their flair for late 70s pomp rock. Mark that down boys, as one of the few (very few) times a modern band sounds anything like Styx, though I think these guys are influenced by that time period, particularly Queen.<br /><br />Then they keep you guessing; 'It gets better' is akin to early 2000s college/inde rock, but a great song no doubt, then, in the second half of the album they go in a kind of R&B direction, with 'All Alone' being an enjoyable anthem, 'One Foot' sounds a bit like Eminem, minus the donkey references. 'Stars' is an attempted 'epic' that sounds a bit like Maroon 5, eww, and I'd venture it's possibly the weakest song here, with all these ugly processed vocals and meandering for almost 7 minutes but not really going anywhere.<br /><br />In the middle of all that is the remarkable song 'Why am I the one' which has soothing vocal harmonies and a gentle, folky sound, and at the end is the so-called 'bonus track'; that's one way to make your fans feel like their getting value for money, pretend the last song is a 'bonus'. But 'Out on the town' is my second favourite song here. It's sort of R&B but more melodic and has a great chorus.<br /><br />Overall, a decent listen, very interesting to hear the diverse range of influences. It doesn't all work, but this band are good musicians, good singers, and have genuine talent. I'd say the best tracks are 4 - 7 and 11, and I'd rate the disc three stars.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|It was good to get back to Selene's story after a few years. But she and Michael are captured not far into the movie. Selene wakes up 12 years later, and meets a new main character whose existence is actually just about impossible. There's a bunch of fighting and blood and gore, etc. You know, the stuff underworld is known for. Just as the story gets going, the movie ends at less than 80 minutes. It was a huge disappointment, but I guess at least that means Underworld 5 is coming soon.<br /><br />The movie's worth seeing if you're a fan of the series, but don't buy it for any more than $12. Seriously.
B001M3LG84|4.0|I really enjoyed the music and pagentry that Andre Rieu is famous for.......sometimes I play the DVD and just listen to the music and other times sit and listen and watch the show.  I highly reccomend this DVD. ' Amazing Grace' is superb with Scott bands of bagpipes and drums, not a dry eye in the concert hall.
0064440346|5.0|Written and illustrated by the gifted children's author Arnold Lobel (Frog and Toad Are Friends), this is a lovely collection of disconnected ramblings in the I Can Read series. It is suitable for preschool through first grade in terms of readability level, but could be used with slightly older kids, in terms of topics or content.<br /><br />Owl's \\"stories\\" are more like musings -- about winter winds, the moon that is always following Owl everywhere he goes, being in two places at once, sadness, two scary bumps under the covers (his feet), etc. The book almost feels like a collection of fairly paranoid ramblings. (;-)  But I liked it. It is gentle and rather soothing. In some cases, quite funny. Moreover, each \\"story\\" serves as a springboard to talk with children about important issues like fear, sadness, friendship, etc. Some offer a springboard for nature lessons, physics, exercises in logic (why we cannot be in two places at once, how it could seem like the moon is following us) etc.<br /><br />There are 5 stories. In Tear-Water Tea, Owl explains how to make tea for a sad day. Just think of everything that makes you sad, like that crayon that rolled away, never to be found again, and let your tears fill the tea pot. Savour the tea and then get over it. It sounds creepy, but no. It's brilliant. Beautiful even.<br /><br />Another excellent story to read with children on sad days is [[ASIN:1416985956 Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day]]
B007KOLNXC|5.0|This is a sometimes dark but fascinating drama. Very true to the 60s both in attitudes and costume. In many ways it shows how far society has progressed and also how little. Well written with intriguing characters.

0425263908|1.0|This book was terrible. The plot was definitely going for the FSOG style, which it didn't succeed.  It was so far fetched it was in no way beliveable.  I felt cheated on this purchase and returned it.  If Sylvia Day wants to be a writer she needs to come up with her own stories and write from the heart not from someone else stories.  I know that FSOG was a story E L James came up with from the Twilight books, but she was always up front about it and made the Shades of Grey her own story.  This book was such a wanna be of Shades of Grey and failed so terribly that I think Ms. Day owes Ms. James an apology.  Aside from all the copying from FSOG the book was written with so many grammatical errors, unbeliveable situations and downright boring/repetitive sex scenes I quit reading it.  It is a waste of time and money.  A good book is a joy to hold in your hands and a good author can take you places in your mind that you only dream of --this definitely was not one of those books.
1455502758|5.0|No one who might have glanced over back in December at a post on my now defunct political blog, Orwell's Hanky, about the death of Christopher Hitchens, will labor through this review with any misapprehensions regarding objectivity. I've grown to become very comfortable in the position that no review (or even, honestly, rather much journalism of any sort) can or should reach for objectivity. I'm ready to concede there are certain benefits to even pretending about it, but I think the cost is too high. More deserving of emphasis here however is the probability that there hasn't been anything said about the Hitch in his entire writing and intellectual life (other than the fact of his departure) that has been objective.<br /><br />While the elegance and emotional intensity apparent in the admiring interviews and essays that came in the wake of his death were often a joy to read, and very expected, equally expected were the vitriolic grandstanding of his more ludicrous detractors who rarely seemed aware of the irony that in attempting to so articulately dismantle the man they only proved to miming him, offering unabashed swings like the kind he was so famous for (if `Hitchslap' doesn't find a place in the vernacular of debate, we'll have truly proven ourselves unworthy of the namesake) but never with near as much wit or flourish-they consistently, though loudly, missed the mark repeatedly-drunken duelists putting their rapiers right into their own feet before tripping. You honestly felt you could sense that they had been spending the nearly two years of Hitchens's affliction saving up what they thought were outlandishly lovely barbs, really working and polishing them up, setting them aside as they awaited the grim release from the gate.<br /><br />The short pieces collected here, many of which appeared originally in Vanity Fair, felt so sadly strange to me. Having spent most of the last several years reading more or less every printed word from the man, I like many had become so used to the aura of him when he was really on stride-and he nearly always was, another one of his feats as an intellectual and rhetorical superhero-while he too occasionally could fall victim to bad puns, Christopher was admirably sickened by cliche, yet the frequent description that he was `larger than life' seems inescapable. The strange and beautiful sadness of this little book-it's smallness also feels both appropriate and tortuous, a party ending that no one is ready to leave-is that it shows that while Christopher was larger than life, he was never too large so as to become unreal, truly a superman; he was `just' a man, and shares the same ending we all do. While his memoir Hitch-22 to my mind lacked a bit strangely in that it felt slightly too distant (Hitchens declared several times he refused to make it only about himself, and only wrote it in a way where it was always a way to write about other people, events, historic moments), Mortality is intensely personal, acutely present in its body-ness. Christopher writes with a directness and vulnerability that can only be described as `brave', another cliche, and one of the collected, disjointed notes in the book's final chapter reveal an unsurprising opinion about this brand of `courage': \\"Brave? Hah! Save it for a fight you can't run away from.\\"<br /><br />The other notes (and the entire collection) also reveal a mind and personality that rejects many of the shallow criticisms one finds against `intellectuals' (i.e., when one encounters it in the wild being used in a pejorative sense)-his scattered, unfinished personal notes referencing Larkin, Symborska, Alan Lightman, Saul Bellow, Proust...aren't the flippant conversational parries looking to impress party-goers. They're the fluent, quiet constructions of a brilliant mind looking to do in its literal final chapter what it has done so many times before: using art and literature and beauty and sadness and fear and pain to make some kind of sense of thebrutal but pristine reality of a universe found ever uncaring about our human ends, full as they so often are with unfairness, dullness, banality and days each full of a fresh physical agony and humiliation. A strange and painful rash, hands and feet gone numb, cruelly alternating constipation and its opposite-Christopher details these abusive little passport stamps from `Tumortown' as the engine of his mind continues on seemingly unblemished.<br /><br />Also unsurprising is Christopher's refusal to give in to the sometimes overwhelming tempations to solipsism or self-pity; he knows and writes  the pointlessness of asking `Why me?' to a universe that'd never even be bothered to reply, `Why not?' Particularly cruel, though, seems to be finding himself `in the land of the unwell' just as he felt he was reaching a pleasant plateau in life. He writes, \\"...I have been taunting the Reaper into taking a free scythe in my direction and have now succumbed to something so predictable and banal it bores even me. Rage would be beside the point for the same reason. Instead, I am badly oppressed by the gnawing sense of waste. I had real plans for my next decade and felt I had worked hard enough to earn it. Will I really not live to see my children married?\\"<br /><br />And, for a man known so well for his booming voice and the mental acrobatics with which he could fuel it, the paragraphs later on detailing his thankfully temporary loss of his voice, as well as the bouts of cloudy, sluggish `chemo-brain' are inescapably afloat on an aching terror of what cancer might steal from him well before it all ended, and are some of the most poignant and starkly personal he ever wrote.<br /><br />One certainly feels the sadness and quiet rage (however pointless) in these honest moments, and I'm sure to be in vast and good company with those that feel as sad and angry as only his readers can at the robbery of such a mind and personality at such a young age. As famous to his conservative opponents for his mostly liberal, Marxist ideals and (probably most famously) for his iconic anti-theism as he remains to his liberal comrades for his pro-war stances, it remains a wonder and a testament that those that were most ready to disagree with his political and religious views were ready to defend well past his death his charm, his warm and honest friendship, his generosity of time and spirit to the younger generations, and his humanistic principles towards justice and freedom in all its forms. While he'll most likely always be famous for his atheistic debates and books, it's very much more important to remember that God was only the biggest of the tyrants on his to-fight list. Christopher was first and foremost a philosophical soldier on the front line against any brand of totalitarianism; well before his illness he was almost famous simply as someone who knew how to live a broad and full life, and he deeply treasured the importance of allowing all people the chance to find their way to do the same. This final, minimal collection is a quiet, nearly stoic meditation of such a personality coming to a close.<br /><br />The foreward by longtime friend and editor Graydon Carter speaks even more to the warmth and lasting richness of Christopher's friendship; the afterward by his wife Carol Blue is heartbreaking and hopeful, cherishing and loving without ever being cloying or sentimental. Her words show Christopher the sweet and witty husband, the `impossible act to follow' as much at home as when he took the stage. Blue's touching voice to end the book is a generous one, and we're all lucky to find its inclusion here. Her words will make anyone with a pulse weep.<br /><br />To let myself be victim to another cliche, for many this book will be a look at the man behind the legend; Christopher says that often the mark of a good writer is that their readers always feel directly addressed, almost preternaturally so-here more than ever will this feel true. Christopher wasfond of saying he always knew he had been burning the candle at both ends, but `had found it gave off a lovely light'-lovely feels like a word both impossibly accurate and lacking. I feel myself becoming far too saccharine for comfort to simply say this book allows what feels like a few last moments with such a singular and bettering light, but it does.<br /><br />Mortality will be available in early September from Twelve Books.

B008BM9L72|2.0|Fifty Shades - it has almost become an Australianism used in all sorts of ways. I struggled through the first book, struggled through the second book and didn't bother with the third. If ever I wrote a book I would definitely use the same marketing company as used for Fifty Shades. All (or most) of us women have read it and I have yet to talk to anyone who liked/loved it. Good luck to the author - she did a brilliant job getting it out there and everyone talking about it. Talk about it - great - but I guess you need to read it to join in the discussions. So, if you haven't read it, then do so and be as disappointed as the rest of us.

B001URA26Y|4.0|The four Ninja Turtles are back and so is the Shredder in this sequel to [[ASIN:B001T5BZAO Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. The turtles investigate the TGRI, which produced the ooze that mutated the turtle and Master Splinter. Shredder is alive and regroups with what is left of the Footclan. They kidnap the scientist that created the TGRI and they force him to create two other mutants.<br /><br />The sequel is more lighthearted that the previous movie, but it is a fun movie for kids. I do have two problems with the movie: There was no Casey Jones and the pizza delivery kid was annoying.
B0048LPRCS|1.0|If there is such a thing as a film with virtually no redeeming value, this just might be it.<br /><br />Cruel, exploitive, repetitive, annoying, shock for shock's sake.....everything is seen as through a veil of muted green, the same 'music' going ON and ON and ON....<br /><br />No real humanity here, the movie does not even allow for any empathy for the characters or their plight...it makes you feel like you are trapped in this half-life of drugs and sex, I can't think of anything bright or alive or even resembling human feelings....<br /><br />Some of the images just go WAY beyond the pale, no reason or sense to them....I wouldn't be surprised if the director has some serious issues with women......in a sick way......<br /><br />Anyone who makes a movie like this must have had some trauma or dysfunction in their childhood or lives to have come up with this pretentious dreck.....yuck!

B009WUAK2M|3.0|We love the movies when the old guys get together: \\"Expendables\\", \\"Red\\", and \\"Rocky 24\\" or whatever. What this movie demonstrates is that it is not enough to get the cast together to rehash old lines (heck it would have been nice to have seen more of that) but you really need a good script and some good new lines.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a quick scene of the Expendables fighting Chinese communists. The good guys have round eyes and say, \\"Yo\\", while the bad guys don't...with 2 exceptions: Yin Yang (Jet Li) who is a good guy and some CIA agent who was a bad guy. I kept trying to figure out how his presence would figure back into the plot, but the film wasn't that deep. At one point Barney (Stallone) is running in the jungle, the next minute he is flying a plane? Did my theater cut out a scene?<br /><br />Church (Bruce Willis) sends our group on a new mission which includes the new guy Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) who wants to make this his last mission. As a loyal Trekkie I already knew what was going to happen to the new guy in the landing party. This then leads to a \\"payback\\" mission over an improbable scenario written by someone who knows nothing about the handling and storage of weapons grade plutonium.<br /><br />The film attempts to force new memorable lines on us like \\"Rest in Pieces\\" which made me cringe. Arnold and Norris provide some cameo appearances with Jean-Claude Van Damme playing the bad guy...not just any bad guy but one with a Satanic goat tattoo on his neck. Seriously?<br /><br />Stallone has done better. For all the big names, this is a mediocre script.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: 1 F-Bomb, no sex, no nudity.

0345803485|1.0|Contains spoilers:<br /><br />Aside from the painfully juvenile writing, this book is absolutely ridiculous and sickening. Having borrowed this book from a family member, and wanting to understand what the female excitement was about (being a woman myself), I can only plainly state that this book is a pedophile's dream. Ana is supposed to be a 21 year old college student but she is a virgin, has never even masturbated, has her first intoxication episode conveniently after she meets the \\"hero\\" (gotta have that man to save you ladies!), as well as says things like \\"jeez\\", \\"holy cow\\", and \\"down there\\". She's referred to as a child, treated as a child and at one point even wears pigtails. Take away the age of our \\"heroine\\"  and it's obvious this \\"woman\\" is emotionally about 13 years old. Our \\"romantic hero\\" is a typical wealthy, older man \\"sex god\\". Who is also a control freak of the highest order. He barks the orders to her of how much and how often she can eat, where she can go, who she can hang out with, if she can drive, etc, etc. He likes to take his issues (both physically and mentally) out on this emotional child. Having been sexually molested himself, Christian continues the cycle and rips through her virginity and innocence, thereby making her HIS possession and because she is the mindset of a young girl, she finds this \\"so sexy\\". He is not likable and for those that say he is, I ask: would he be such a hunk if his great wealth was taken away? No fancy hotels, no sprawling mansions, no private jet, no thousand dollar gifts. Or would he be that man that those lifetime movies warn you about?<br /><br />The fact that these books are receiving the accolades they are is sickening. Like a typical porno, the plot is non-existent, the characters one dimensional and the sex scenes are borderline gross in their detail; especially with the narrators internal dialogue making it painfully obvious how emotionally stunted she is. Take away the sex they are constantly having,you would end up with half a book not to mention if you read it with the perspective of a sexual predator preying on an innocent child like mind, it becomes sickening. Let's not forget how he beats her at the end but she goes running back because he's so \\"sowwey\\" and our \\"bright and strong\\" narrator forgot to tell him that being spanked hard with a belt hurts. SWOON!<br /><br />I read somewhere that E.L.James doesn't care about negative reviews on amazon because \\"she's making tons of money\\" (paraphrased). All the money in the world doesn't change the fact that she has horribly written a pornographic book with strong pedophilia tones. With hollywood's actors lining up to play an abusive sexual predator and people lining up to have her sign their pedo-books, it becomes obvious how ill our society has become. Sexual, mental, physical, and emotional abusers used to be called out as the scum they are but I guess as long as the guy is \\"Bill Gates\\" wealthy, insanely good looking and the woman is physically written as a 21 year old then it's sexy and \\"oh so romantic\\".

B008XTVWHK|4.0|Ah, &#34;The Valley of Gwangi&#34;;  Ray Harryhausen's final foray into the world of the dinosaurs.  Well, he sure goes out with a bang.  While it's my opinion that &#34;Gwangi&#34; isn't a particularly GREAT film, it's certainly worth watching if only for Harryhausen's fantastic stop-motion effects and a novel premise.  The human characters are a bit of a bore, with the writing relying on too many cliché plot tropes.  The overarching plot itself is little more than a retread of &#34;King Kong&#34; with western elements and without the central beast's fascination with blondes.  However, the enjoyable special effects and absolutely thrillng musical score by Jerome Moross more than make up for the film's drawbacks.  The best and most memorable sequence in the movie is when the cowboys begin roping Gwangi, the titular Allosaurus, as if he is cattle.  The film isn't a classic in the normal sense of the word, given that it is less than perfect (no one remembers this film for anything besides the special effects, after all), but it IS a great example of vintage dinosaur filmmaking.  All of this said, I still think it's a GOOD film at the very least.  As for the DVD, the Warner Archive Collection version is the exact same disc as the 2003 release.  For those of you that are unfamiliar with that release, it features a decent widescreen transfer with a few extras.  Personally, I was a little worried when I ordered my copy; given Warner Archive's low budget origins it seemed like the disc might just feature a bare menu and play option, as most of their discs do.  I need not have worried, for as stated this is simply a reissue of the 2003 DVD under the Warner Archive banner.  It features the same menus, extras, widescreen presentation and audio options that the original release did (including the short featurette &#34;Return to the Valley&#34;).  The only difference is in the packaging: the cover art has been updated to reflect the fact that this version is produced by WarnerArchive and the disc comes in a plastic keepcase as opposed to the terrible cardboard snapcases that Warner used to issue all of its releases in.  The disc itself has slightly updated art as well and is printed on a DVD-R as opposed to the discs used for premiere releases.  So, fear not, potential buyers.  If you're looking to acquire a copy of this film, this version is the way to go.  The original release is long out of print and the prices as of this writing are ridiculous.  You will only be paying more for an older version of the same thing.  Unless you just can't bear the thought of having anything but an original copy, save your money and get this release instead.

B0036XN2L2|5.0|I caught the single \\"Raised on Rock\\" several times on Sirius XM radio, but I didn't get around to buying the album until a few months ago.  My only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner.  Admittedly I've never been a devoted Scorpions fan, and up until this year I really only owned the 2-CD compilation \\"Deadly Sting: Best of the Mercury Years\\" and \\"World Wide Live\\".  So trust me, I'm not a guy who writes 5-star reviews to the entire Scorpions catalog.<br /><br />This album is simply amazing.  And, dare I say it, it's right up there with their big name albums of the early 80s.  Like most classics, it clocks in at just around 45 minutes long, and doesn't have a single bad track on it.  Great Scorpions guitar riffs, and infectious melodies that will stay in your head for days on end.  Stunning audio production as well.  I can't go more than a few days without ever listening to it.<br /><br />The album starts with the single \\"Raised on Rock\\", then goes right into the heavier title track, and the even heavier yet sleazy \\"Slave Me\\".  The dramatic third track \\"The Good Die Young\\" sounds like a ballad at first, but kicks in to something much more serious.  \\"No Limit\\" and the faster \\"Rock Zone\\" are great songs as well.  Scorpions always had a great approach to ballads, and the ballad \\"Lorelei\\" really shines, and between the other ballad \\"Sly\\" I'd have to say \\"Lorelei\\" is the stronger of the two.  The next track, \\"Turn You On\\" is definitely one of my favorites if I had to pick one, and if I had to compare it to a past hit, I'd say it's rather reminiscent of \\"Big City Nights\\".  \\"Spirit of Rock\\" is an anthem similar in spirit to \\"Raised on Rock\\", but a strange hint of melancholy to it and great guitar duo harmonies.<br /><br />Finally we end with the prophetic(?) track \\"The Best is Yet to Come\\".  Is this really the last album the Scorpions will make?  It seemed to be that way at first, but the current news (or so I heard) is that the band may not be quitting completely but at least scaling back how extensively they want to record and tour.  Let's face it, they're not going to be physically alive forever.  If this does end up being the last though, they sure went out with an over-the-top \\"bang\\"!
B004UID2LC|2.0|the app was working fine but now it keeps saying playback error and it makes me mad they need to make some updates to it and restore it!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|the game is awesome and tottally worth wat I paid for and dosent expose every thing in the movie so you can buy it before you see the movie
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This compiliation just blows me away. the sound quality compared to the tracks I had previous to buying this are like night and day. we all know all the songs on this CD are classics but buy this just for the immense improvement in quality.  (PLEASE)  Listening it to the the 1st time was like all the songs were brand new.<br /><br />I own some pretty high end headphones,and have been collecting remastered 70's/80;s CD's that being said it was very pleaseant listening to this CD. If you have pedestrian sound equipment, you may not hear much difference. If you are into higher end equipment then buying this will be fun. Enjoy
B008RTE09S|1.0|The Beatles did so many great things in their time and they have held up extraordinarily well.  This, however, is a profound stinker.  Scriptless, witless, pointless and often flat out stupid - this was our first hint of McCartney's self-indulgent insipidness that would later become evident with Wings and many of his other projects.  The scene where he's dancing around during \\"Fool on the Hill\\" makes you cringe with embarrassment - you think, \\"Were these guys HIGH?\\"  And the answer of course, is \\"very.\\"<br /><br />The extremely high quality of blue-ray is only going to make the crappy 16mm film look even more pathetic.  The songs, of course, are a different matter.  \\"I am the Walrus\\" is brilliant.  The rest are not bad - but certainly not among their best.  (Remember, the b-side of the album is not a part of the movie.  The MMT soundtrack was released as an EP in UK - in the US they added a second side with singles which beef up the album substantially.)<br /><br />I mean, if you are a real die-hard Beatle trivia nut, you may want it.  But if you're not, you'll watch it once and put it away forever.  It is really, truly, completely, profoundly BAD.
B000EOUTTO|5.0|This CD is so much better that the original.If you you havent purchased any remasters of your favorite 70s/80s music do your self a huge  favor.......start doing it .......... Its relatively inexpensive and the benefits are immeassurable .......like night and day  Beware- make sure the listed CD states remastered or import. Burn them in a lossess format on Itunes or whatever process you use. Be wary of direct D/L of albums becuase you will not usually get the results desired. direct D/L is the easy way to get them quickly but its worth the wait to buy and burn yourself,I save money buying then fron Amazon and it does take extra work. Dont be lazy, Your ears will thank you for it in the long run. I use higher end audio equipment so if you have standard stuff then this review is probably a waste of time. Those of you that have invested in higher end equipment will understand. ROCK ON
B008K8H9C6|5.0|This game is a real interesting twist on the Rube Goldberg genre.  The graphics are slick and while some levels are very simple, some are also very challenging.  It's a nice mix.  It's worth the download.  Works well on my K1 and A500.  It's also a big hit with my granddaughter.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'm going to be very limited in my review as to not give anything away. This review will be a large part of my confession of love for Colleen and her beautiful story, a large part of continuous squeals and gushy moments, and a small part about the story itself. It's a book that when you find things out for yourself as you read it, it's much better than going into it knowing everything that will happen. That said, Slammed is also a book I will reread continuously when I need a great read because even now that I know what occurs I'm still a bit obsessed!<br /><br />Layken's life has been shifted and moved from one state to another. Her 9 year old brother, her mother, and herself are forced to relocate and replant. Her brother's transition is flawless as he instantly makes a best friend with the boy across the street. A boy who has an older brother named Will, who catches Layken's eye. These characters are beautifully created. It's a talent few have, to successfully build a person out of words, and Colleen does a fantastic job.<br /><br />This book is shocking. I think it's the fact that I didn't know what to expect and didn't really know what the story was going to be about, other than the fact that it was a contemporary. I loved every second of it! SQUEE! Colleen made me feel so much for everyone and everything, I feel like she opened my eyes. I LOVED THIS BOOK!<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is about Snowmans. I KNOW SNOWMANS, who would've thought. But, it's a great part and when WHEN you read the book remember me when you read about snowmans (and KoolAid). This book has a serious tone, but a comedic and fun one as well. I smiled a lot, cried a lot, yelled a lot, and laughed a lot. It has the perfect balance of elements and kudos to Colleen.<br /><br />I loved this book! I can't wait to purchase it and its sequel and read them both, this one for the second time! It's uplifting and full of strong characters. A love story that will frustrate and rip your heart out, only to piece it back together and tear it out again. It's an all around great read that I can't wait for everyone to read.<br /><br />Sorry about being all shouty with the caps, but I hope they got my point across!<br /><br />READ IT!<br />READ IT!<br />READ IT!<br /><br />Got it?

B008XG1X18|5.0|I could not download this app fast enough! I am very excited to be able to use Pinterest on my Kindle Fire!! Another reason to retire my laptop!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game! its simple, challenging, and addictive! only downside is I wish there were more levels... so I could play all day :)
030758836X|2.0|I enjoyed reading this book until about halfway when the twist is revealed and then there's one contrivance after another leading to a totally implausible ending.  Literary dishonesty is always disappointing.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It lets you watch youtube videos along with letting you download them! Every now and then it freezes but other than that its the greatest!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Its been a long time since I read a book that I keep thinking about afterwards. I can relate to the characters and what they went through. I would highly recommend this book, especially to parents of teens.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I like the game but you need a lot of money to advance in things and it gets annoying sometimes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the old card classic. a great game to pass down time! definitely worth downloading. some random info pops up before each game,  but you can just hit skip and it goes to the game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a tough critic and seldom read books I really love.  I couldn't put this one down. I put it in a catagory with Hunger Games and Twilight in that I couldn't wait to finish my necessary tasks so I could get back to reading it. As I was reading through the first book, I thought I had it all figured out, but the book was full of twist and turns. When I finished reading, I wanted more. Can't wait for the movie.  I am sure there will be one.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I have this game on my ipod , I'm level 34 on there and I want to login on here. great game other than that, would get better rating if that was there.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not overly complex- just a fun collection of mini -games.  Its free and mildly addictive as you try to unlock additional games.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolughtly love this game it is soooooo addicting and it works great on my kendle fire and on my sisters ipod!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|What an addictive and fun game!  You can certainly play the game without spending any extra money.  I was getting sad knowing the final levels were near and then they give me an amazing surprise.  I get to be the zombie!  I am thrilled!  Samurai vs. Zombies was quite a find and provides hours of joy.  I need a ten step program to put it down!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I began GONE GIRL being very enthused by the well-paced storyline and skillfully crafted language.  It promised to be a tale about a young marriage, gone awry during the changing events in today's America, which is often fraught with economic and subculture struggles.  It initially offered a believeable theme to which many readers could relate.  If one is interested in how people from the distinct, rival regions of the US can marry and survive eachothers' cultural mindsets, then this book is a good example of 'North Meets South'. But as the story progressed, something in the tale shifted.<br /><br />As the plot neared its end, I became disappointed with the lack of a clear conclusion.  I will admit that writing a good conclusion, and not just 'stopping' a novel, is not easy.  However with this book, I sensed that the author's excellent characterizations could not be 'let go', so the tale sort of peetered out without wrappping up any of the main- or sub-plots.  Maybe the author wanted her readers to get caught up in the mindsets of her main characters, as she seemed to do.<br /><br />Finally I felt frustrated and fed up with the theme that became unrealistic with its increasing angst, agony and one-dimensional character mindsets.  Was this intended as a psycological thriller or something else?  Not sure. Somewhere in the middle of this novel, Ms. Flynn seemed to change her mind about what genre of story she wanted to tell.<br /><br />However the author uses very skilled language.  Her use of changing, narrator perspective is unique and makes the reading interesting.  Her depiction of setting is very good, in that the descriptions are spare, yet clearly stated.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has talent and I would be interested in her future writing, in order to share in her journey as a storyteller.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet.  Unlike analog transfers of music to digital CD's in the 90's, the restorations of classic 70's films in particular, such as the the epic Jaws to Blu-Ray, are spectacular.<br /><br />The visual clarity, booming surround sound, and full-screen experience can be had once again just like you experienced it as a kid in the theaters a long time ago, and it doesn't lose a bit of its cinematic style or film-based patina and style.  I love to watch Jaws every few years, and this upgrade to what's been available for the last 30+ years is a joy to experience.<br /><br />As these classics of 70's and early 80's cinema are being restored, it's a joy to experience them again in Blu-Ray at home with today's technology, and that doesn't include the enjoyable extras and commentary you get as well.  Not sure there's much more to be said about this, it's a fantastic restoration that manages to somehow stay true to the original look, feel and style of the cinematography. Being able to re-live that era in such clarity again, from the objects, clothes, hair styles and elements, are amazing to see in this manner. It's impressive to see what a difference this sort of treatment makes.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|my grand daughter loved this movie and the first<br />one as well.  it is a good family movie and we enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|when i first started reading this book i was so intrigued. its definitely better then any harry potter and i loved the series so much i plowed through it in like five days.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|What a tremendous story. A bit of suspense, a bit of mystery, a bit of romance, and a lot of humor, pathos, and naivety. There were a very few grammar problems - the ubiquitous \\"lay\\" instead of \\"lie\\", but that was pretty much all. The plot was well thought out with some nice twists and turns, and the characters were believably flawed. One of the best I've read in the last several months and I read five or more books a week. I will certainly watch for more books by Ms. Swank.
B000M341QE|2.0|Because this is a movie about violent people, the violence depicted is hardly gratuitous, but it made the movie unwatchable for me.  \\"The Departed\\" promises a satisfyingly intricate story, and I regret that I could not give the movie its due.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It makes u think and it is very fun to do. and it is tricky.<br />I am used to doing spider solitaire but when I got this it was way better than spider solitaire.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This Kindle Fire was given to me on my 85th birthday by my son .It took me a while<br /><br />to get use to it.Ihad no idea what Angry Birds was all about or what to do with it,<br /><br />but I learned. Now it is fun.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|This book is not some of Lee Childs best work. The story is not bad but Childs needed more action and less writing about feelings He is one of the best action suspense writers around he just needs to stick with that and stay out of Romance.
1476712042|5.0|I seriously loved this book. Before reading it I read mixed reviews but I actually loved this book. Such a great young love story. Super excited for Walking Disaster!! Jamie McGuire is brilliant!!
145470246X|5.0|This is an amazingly written book.  Instructions are very easy to follow along with wonderful illustrations.  I have alot of bead books, but this one is currently my favorite.  I have shown several bead store owners my projects that I have made from the book and they stated that they will be ordering several for their store. Amazon's packaging was great and received it on time and in excellent condition.
0345803507|5.0|People can say whatever they want about this series but no love is perfect and this was such an amazing trilogy. It basically goes to show what a person would do for love no matter how screwed up they were. I recommend this trilogy to anyone that loves a good love story that is royally screwed up. E.L James did a fantastic job!
0767817478|4.0|Ok after giving the movie a chance and actually watching it, it's actually pretty good. The cgi graphics are quite good for 1998, and the story line wasn't bad, casting was pretty good too. If the creature had of been called something other than Godzilla, it would have came across better I feel.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book. I loved 50 shades as well but to me these were different. They had the same appeal but this book was very sexy. Sylvia Day is brilliant. I can not wait for Reflected to you and Entwined to you. No matter the bad reviews this book is worth the read.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Kind of like Formation of Damnation meets The Ritual. Love this album. Got it quickly and it arrived in great shape.
0345803493|5.0|This was my favorite book of the serious. Simply brilliant! E.L James has done an amazing job at making the most sexy fictional character ever. Even though Christian seems jealous crazy and dominate it is still crazy sexy!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I have heard great things about this book, so I decided to check it out. I started reading it and almost quit around 1/3 of the way through. It was painfully slow until about halfway through, then it picked up and got more interesting. I was really enjoying Clary and Jace's budding relationship until certain things were revealed, then not so much (not going to spoil anything). I am very interested to see what happens next, so I am going to check out the other books in the series.
0345803485|5.0|E.L James is brilliant. I loved this book! Christian Grey sexiest fictional character ever! Very sexy book. I can not wait until she writes more!
B008VBYN80|1.0|this game is really retarded, its like another version of all the free gameloft games, bad graphics, bad gameplay, bad controls.
B007O3QC8K|1.0|If it weren't for Bruckner (and to a lesser extent, Mahler), I probably wouldn't have made it through my adolescence in one piece. I think too much, feel too hard, and it has taken me the majority of my life to learn even a modicum of patience. And it's really only thanks to Bruckner that I've learned how to become patient, because He taught me about space and time, because it was through his music that I learned what silence meant, how loud sounds and fast gestures are essentially meaningless and worthless without silence and stillness. It's almost as if Bruckner taught me how to focus, how to wait, how to breathe, how to truly appreciate the destination throughout the journey.<br /><br />Bruckner is something that I need to experience regularly, there's no better way to celebrate or contemplate or ruminate than taking a nice little romp through the heavens. And it's been a rough couple of concert-seasons for me here in New York, in terms of Bruckner. Harnoncourt cancelled Bruckner 8! Welser-Most played the original version of Bruckner 8! Welser-Most didn't include Bruckner 3 or Bruckner 6 in his traversal! Alan Gilbert just does not understand Bruckner 2! Of the three consecutive Bruckner 8s I attended by Mehta, only one of them was half-way acceptable! And worst of all, an absolutely horrendous live performance of Rattle conducting Bruckner 9!<br /><br />Thankfully, Welser-Most did an astonishing Bruckner 7 and a fantastic Bruckner 9, and also Haitink did a very nice Bruckner 7. But I cannot live without truly great Bruckner 8s and Bruckner 9s. Thankfully, there have been some recent DVD releases of Celibidache that have carried me through this concert-going dry spell. Having regained some strength, I gave the Rattle Bruckner 9 another shot, this time on Compact Disc in the privacy of my own home, and all I can say is that Rattle is just not a Brucknerian. It is my sincere opinion that Rattle uses the completion as a crutch, because it allows him to rearrange andrestructure the symphony as a whole, in its traditional guise, which he apparently doesn't understand and can't even approach.<br /><br />This performance is very chipper, very chirpy, shallow and superficial. It's not because it's fast, because I'm fine with speed, Jochum's EMI Bruckner 9 was pretty much the first performance that actually got through to me and it's very fast. This performance feels glossed-over, blurred, and because the music is allowed to be unresolved, it feels constipated. Even after multiple--agonizing--listens. And the finale, I just cannot take seriously. Does the original version of Bruckner 8 sound like the final version of Bruckner 8? Absolutely not! Because Bruckner threw out a lot of music, because Bruckner re-conceptualized the work and reorganized his priorities of which details were most essential to achieve his desired goals. Well what makes the people who threw together all these incomplete and discarded fragments think that gluing them all together will somehow work? If Bruckner can delete Bruckner, what makes a bunch of \\"scholars\\" think that sticky-tacking a bunch of scraps--of which Bruckner did not ultimately approve--together will somehow work? Bruckner's composition process, theoretically, took place in another dimension. And truly great performances of Bruckner's compositions, theoretically, take place in another dimenson. But this recording is just pedestrian and plebian, as is the \\"completion.\\" If Rattle didn't rely on the completion so much in order to organize his understanding of the work as a whole, perhaps we would have had a decent first and second and third movement, but I just don't think any actual thought went into this. And then there's the \\"new\\" music, created out of nowhere by the editors of the completed last movement, it really is just laughable, absurd nonsense, awful junk.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I enjoy this game so much. I played a lot on my dads iPhone and was addicted. The game is fun but the graphics are a little pixleatep but I would still highly recommend this to anyone!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book draws attention to the less than perfect foster care system in a very unlikely manner, through the use of flowers and their meanings.  It is a woman's journey to learn how to love and be loved.  I highly recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it works on my fire - it is very accurate - fast - allows for multiple locations - and it has some  interesting features that most all of the other weather  apps don't have.
031620157X|4.0|A remarkable story that i couldn't put down. The only thing that would of made it perfect is if the artist who drew the images at the start of each chapter could of included a map of the kingdoms for us to follow Alex and Conner through.<br /><br />  Alex and Conner are twins whose family are down on their luck since the death of their father and struggling to make ends meet.  On their birthday the twins get a special gift from their grandmother. A book called The Lands of Stories. When Conner wishes their lives could be more like those in the book of fairy tales it begins to glow. Before the two know it their avoiding packs of wolves, hungry gingerbread house witches, burning castles down and being sold into slavery to trolls All during the wildest scavenger hunt ever as they seek out the items needed to create the wishing spell to go home.  They meet all their fairy tale personalities; and with Snow White's evil stepmother also after the same spell learn her untold story that resulted in her heart of stone. The longer they spend in this other dimention the more connections to it they seem to have. Could their family be hiding a secret greater than just a magic book to another world?<br /><br />If you like classic fairy tales or even modern ones like The Sisters Grimm you like this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|first day playing but great so far.. my hubby has been playing this game for over a week and enjoys it. he finally took my kindle and installed it for me today.. well see how it goes....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series has been one of my favorite series ever made. Joss Whedon is a genius. I don't normally watch series more than once, but in this case, I've watched the entire series 4 or 5 times.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|There are dozens of battery apparently but this is the only one that I kept. It is 100% reliable and accurate.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm rating this book with one star only because Amazon does not give you the opportunity to rate it lower.  I started the book and at mid-point wondered WTF why am I continuing to read this.  But I persevered in hopes that the book would improve.  It didn't!  It might be titillating to women but I cannot really imagine that it is.  So be it. I bought the book and wish I hadn't.
0812993292|5.0|I liked the characters and I liked the setting.  It was easy to read, yet still had meaning.  I needed a book like this on a day I had a migraine.  They are hard to find, so it was greatly appreciated.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|This movie was horrible! I had such high expectations for it. It had great visuals but the story was all over the place and it felt like 10 different people were writing the characters description. The whole movie felt like it was 15min long, nothing happend!! The heroine didn't overcome anything or do anything in the entire movie. Even our 5 year old didn't like it!
B00862KPDQ|5.0|Gorgeous remaster of Platinum with some nice bonus tracks on disc 1!<br />For me though, finding live recordings from the early-to-mid 80's are the holy grail of Oldfields' music.  This was the time when he was starting to strip down his ensembles to the basics, feature guest vocalists, and generally just rocking hard on all his classics.  Disc 2, a live set from 1980 is a great example.  Considering this is a 32 year old recording from an arena performance, the sound quality is superb.<br />I should mention that I purchased the MP3 download and the sound is crisp and clean, better than any previous cd or lp versions that I've owned.  I can only imagine that the actual cd, when heard on a quality stereo system, must be stunning!  I'd recommend the 2cd set anyway, just to avoid those 2 second silent drop-outs between linked songs common with MP3s....very annoying!!<br />Mike Oldfield fans can purchase this with confidence.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|Cameron Diaz plays the eponymous \\"bad\\" teacher Elizabeth Halsey. And she is really bad. Arriving at school hungover, Elizabeth sleeps during the class (while students are watching the video of \\"Stand and Deliver\\"). Being dumped by her wealthy boyfriend, the self-absorbed teacher is determined to get what she wants, that is, a handsome substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), who has just started teaching at her junior high school.<br /><br />This is a one-joke premise, funny in itself as an idea, but it takes a good script to turn into a reasonable feature film. To do so, writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky somehow thought it good to make our heroine shallow and cunning. Elizabeth wants money for breast-implant surgery to impress Scott, so what would she do? Car wash! When she learns about a $5,700 bonus awarded to the teacher of the highest-performing class, what would she do? Something illegal, of course.<br /><br />I liked none of the characters in the film (including Jason Segel's teacher who keeps yelling), but that is not really a problem. Some comedy characters are not really likable persons themselves (remember Mr. Bean). The real problem is, unlike in better comedies, most jokes are not as funny as the filmmakers think, dependent on the concept of \\"bad teacher.\\"<br /><br />And those gags are not just lame; they are mostly like watching a cruel and nasty prank being played on an unsuspecting by-passer. Even Cameron Diaz cannot pull off the trick with ineffective direction of Jake Kasdan. Mixing \\"School of Rock\\" and \\"Bad Santa\\" is not a bad idea, but it needs not only jokes, but storytelling skills and consistent characters of these movies.
031620157X|5.0|The Land of Stories:  The Wishing Spell is excellent.  The story is interesting and kept me wanting to read more about all the characters.  I would recommend this book to children and adults.  Anxious for the next TLOS book to discover more of Conner's and Alex's adventures.  Wonderful first publication from Chris Colfer.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Works fine on kindle fire. it's a bit clunky but that's to be expected doing a big puzzle on a small screen.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Excellent service, but captions would make the experience perfect.  I couldn't see any way to enable captions; if there IS a way and I've missed it, I apologize and please disregard.<br />  There are times when we need to watch movies with minimal volume and captions mean the difference between following the dialog and being completely lost.  As it stands now we'll opt for a Netflix movie with subtitles whenever volume is going to be an issue, which is usually the case.<br />  We used Amazon to watch John Carter a while back and I'm pretty sure there were captions so it must be similiar to Netflix in that some have the option and some don't.  The thing is, I don't remember seeing anything about caption availability while ordering.  Again, if I've just missed it please forgive my ignorance.<br />  No complaints otherwise - thank you for the great service and opportunity to provide feedback.
B00886184A|4.0|A career spanning collection of this cult band might not happen to due different labels owning rights to different albums but at least now there's a compilation  covering one label Gentle Giant were on (except the US and Canada where they were signed to Capitol from 1974-78, which later became sister to Chrysalis when the former home of Blondie, Jethro Tull and Pat Benatar was bought by EMI).  Capitol are now part of Universal and Chrysalis/Parlophone went to Warners as EMI were divvied up under EU law.<br />Most of these albums have been reissued separately by the band's own labels DRT and Alucard, but that could just mean North America where the rights have been reverted back to them as I may have heard before.  Outside North America, perhaps the Chrysalis GG albums could be reissued yet again in future.<br />Free Hand was the bands best selling album in the States just barely making gold status with the RIAA.  Interview would be the last to have the old sound including a Capella vocals.  Playing the Fool has older tracks arranged differently than the original studio versions, notably \\"A Reflection\\", and many others due to the departure of founding member Phil Shulman in 1972 and Kerry Minnears reluctance to sing lead vocals live as he had a softer approach he could only manage in the recording booth and not on the road despite his formal training.  The last three albums were a last-ditch effort to cross over to the mainstream to no avail.  One standout track on Giant for a Day is \\"Friends\\" written and sung by drummer John Weathers (not to be confused with \\"Three Friends\\").  This would be their last album with Capitol as it didn't even chart in the US, while back in the UK, punk was giving the prog scene a run for their money though frontman Derek Shulman said the band has always been derided at home and much of their following built up on the continent and across the pond.<br />The farewell album Civilian has been slated by the band and many fans alike, and the band felt they lost their way and wanted to have normal lives off the road, which led to their split in 1980.  One glaring omission here that struck me was that of \\"Heroes No More\\" on Civilian when there seems to be room for it on one of the other discs (BGO Records once reissued Playing the Fool and Civilian together, which I have on Canadian LPs), and other reissues have had it.  It wasn't even a B-side or on a bootleg as far as I know.  If Civilian is re-released on its own in future then the bonus track could be restored but that may be if the band can get the masters to it (Columbia released that in the US and Canada after taking GG back despite them not releasing the long-elusive In a Glass House which Capitol obviously also rejected).  Despite that Holy Grail of a track being overlooked this is value for money for loyal fans having the second half of the '70s in one package (Civilian was recorded in LA for tax reasons in 1979 when not even a compilation was released as a stop-gap).  I never expected this release though it makes sense.and felt they lost their way and wanted to have normal lives off the road, which led to their split in 1980.

6305127689|5.0|A hot shot navy pilot, Pete Maverick Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a wild one.  He flies an F-14A tomcat off of an aircraft carrier and he fights with his heart sometimes more than his brain.  He is really one of the best.  Due to a fellow pilot resigning after losing his nerve, Pete and his flight partner Nick Goose Bradshaw (Antony Edwards) get sent to the elite Top Gun School.<br /><br />Pete proves his skill at Top Gun school but he also proves his recklessness. He loses his partner, his nerve and perhaps his girl in short order.....<br /><br />People always talk about the Chick Flick; well this is a Man Flick.  This is constant and never ending testosterone pumping action throughout this film. I liked it for the entertainment factor and for the role of Kelly Mc Gillis who was just a knockout in this film.<br /><br />If you like fast action military style movies then this one is a must see film that you will enjoy.

6305161992|4.0|Two police officers are teamed together and it seems that they couldn't be more opposites of each other.  One is an American, Chris Kenner (Dolph Lundgren), raised in Japan and the other is a Japanese American, Johnny Murata (Brandon Lee), raised in the USA.  The only thing they have in common is that they are both martial arts experts and they are cops.  They work the area of town called Little Tokyo in Los Angeles.<br /><br />Chris breaks up an illegal martial arts fight and tries to arrest the organizer and finds himself trapped in the middle of a machine gun fight between the organizer and the Iron Claw Yakuza clan.  The Yakuza is trying to take over Little Tokyo and all that stands in their way is this duo of death defying cops....<br /><br />This is a high action movie between the police and the Japanese mob.  This is the movie debut of Brandon Lee, the son of Bruce Lee, and his fighting skills are famous.  This is a story of vengeance and it features some top notch fighting scenes.  If you like that style of movie then you will like this one for sure.<br />The main focus is the introduction of drug distribution by the Yakuza to the area.<br /><br />As a warning, this movie contains violence, foul language, bloodshed and nudity.<br /><br />I liked this as an action movie and if you like martial arts films this this one is pretty good.  By the way the, \\"I'm sorry for you\\", is what all of Chris Kenner's old partners tell Johnny Murata when he shows up at the police station and they all learn that he is Kenner's new partner!

B00004STDN|4.0|Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is a rescue ranger who is also a mountain climber. He is called in to save stranded climbers in the Rocky Mountains and one of them is his best friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker).  He has had a very bad experience when a female climber is with Hal on a high mountain ledge. Hal has hurt his knee and can't get down the mountain.  While trying to rescue her and Hal, she falls to her death as Gabe is trying to save her.  He blames himself and leaves his job and the town behind.<br /><br />He returns about 8 months later to pick up his last remaining belongings when an emergency call comes in and his help is needed.  It leads him into a dangerous and action filled situation that involves the theft of 100 million dollars and the lives of those he holds dear to his heart.....<br /><br />This is an intense action movie that takes place in the wintery Rocky Mountains and involves planes, helicopters and men armed that are ready to kill to get what they want.  Gabe must help them or face death or the loss of his friends.<br /><br />I liked this movie and it contains a lot of excellent shots of the Rocky Mountains and of mountain climbers.  It also features and interesting storyline, suspense and a lot of good actors.  Stallone did a good job acting in this movie and of course many of the shots were set up to feature his muscular body.  There are great shots of death defying feats and airplane stunts that are just amazing.<br /><br />I liked this movie and I think you will too.  I recommend it to you as a good evening's entertainment!

Digestion of each sub-chapter, with breaks between continuations, has provided me with more than a few hearty inner-dialogued chuckles and discoveries of subtleties giving new meaning to the continuation of the story.

John is the Sanitizer who makes people disappear and also gets rid of the bad guys who regret that they showed up.<br /><br />He is assigned to protect a beautiful woman named Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) who has uncovered plans that her employer is selling super advanced high tech weapons to Russians.  John gets involved to save her life and well as try to find out how multiple key witnesses are being discovered even though they have been erased perfectly.  He also runs into bad guys using the high tech weapons and they are something to behold.....<br /><br />Like most Arnold Schwarzenegger movies this one is a high action and suspense filled story.  It borders on being a near future Sci-Fi story regarding the advanced railguns that are used in the movie and I just liked the entire movie.  It is a tight storyline and a good suspense type of script with a top notch cast of excellent actors.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and I believe that you will find it entertaining as well.  I recommend it to you.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Both Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon joked sometime around the release of The Bourne Ultimatum that there would be a fourth movie entitled \\"The Bourne Redundancy\\". After all, the Bourne book series did go on after Ultimatum, but it wasn't without changes in writers and, sadly, character. And such a book named The Bourne Legacy would indeed be released, except it wasn't released until after Ultimatum. Now I myself will admit I've only read the first two books in the series but not Ultimatum, and it looks like after The Bourne Redundancy... whoops, I mean Legacy, I won't be any time soon.<br /><br />That isn't to say, however, that The Bourne Legacy is, in any way, a bad movie. Because it isn't. It's got quite a lot going for it. It's just a tad disappointing, is all. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the summer, aside from The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers, both of which were absolutely stellar efforts. I mean, for one, I love the Bourne movies. I remember when my dad and my uncle took me to see The Bourne Supremacy upon its release in 2004. Since then it has become my favourite film in the series and my favourite of the series thus far. The movies it was sandwiched between were great too, though I do consider Ultimatum to be my least favourite of the original three.<br /><br />The Bourne Legacy takes place at about the same time as the events in Ultimatum. While Bourne is on the run, Alex Cross (Jeremy Renner) is one of a few selected people put on a super soldier program entitled \\"Operation Outcome\\", run by the CIA. He stays chemically enhanced physically and mentally with a set of multicoloured tablets that he stores in a necklace, named \\"chems\\". He is to take a different colour at each different stage in the day. While deployed in Alaska for a training program, he pretends that he has run out of chems and stumbles upon another like him, named Number Three, staying with him to get some more chems before returning to civilization.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the CIA has been giving others in the program a pill that they convince them will mean more chemical enhancement, without having to take multiple pills. This is really their way of shutting the program down, killing them, run by Eric Byer (Edward Norton), a retired air Forster commissioner. After he sends a drone to kill Number Three, he realizes Cross is still on the run, and will do whatever he can to finally kill Cross off. Cross comes across the doctor who provided him with the chems, Dr. Shearing (Rachel Weisz), and finds out a shocking secret about the process of being chemically enhanced and the way his body takes in the drugs, which leads them to Manila for one hell of an explosive climax.<br /><br />There is quite a bit to like about The Bourne Legacy. For one, Jeremy freakin' Renner. He is instant man crush fuel and this film does not disappoint in that regard. He can act up a storm and he is great for action scenes. And boy, is he beastly in this movie. He has a fair share of great action sequences throughout and if you came specifically to see him slap up some bad guys, then you're in for a treat. Weisz is great as she always is and manages to do an American accent well, with no noticeable slips. The action sequences and chase sequences are fun to watch too, even if the movie becomes just a tad too reliant on action.<br /><br />But there's too much to hate for the movie too. For one, the story seems to not make much sense. The idea of super soldiers is interesting but they don't do much to explain it, like when they bring in this idea of \\"viralling off\\". They give a quick description of what it is, they do it, bam, it's left in the dust as if it never existed. And it's never really explained why they want to shut down the program. There was lots more they could have done with such a sinister subject.<br /><br />Another issue is the characters are flat and boring. Cross himself isn't even that interesting of a character. Even when it's explained how he was put in the program, there isn't much to salvage. It's never a good sign when you don't care about the antagonist too- as the saying goes, \\"a movie is only as good as its antagonist\\", Byer doesn't do much to lift himself from that trap.<br /><br />In the third act, the term \\"an embarrassment of riches\\" comes to mind- the third act is too long, and is just chase scene after chase scene after chase scene and while the climatic motorbike chase is thrilling, at the same time it's just... It's like, the writers forgot the plot and just threw in as many chase scenes as they could.<br /><br />If anything, think of The Bourne Legacy as a good chase movie. Because that's what it is. It's a decent film that's entertaining and has plenty of great chase scenes and action. But as a Bourne movie... well, it's that in name only, and despite Renner, is just a chase movie disguised in spy movie faff. And while it could have been a much, much worse movie,theres lots of ways it could have been better. By that, I mean \\"lots\\".e was put in the program, there isn't much to salvage.

B0084IHVC0|3.0|PRE-SCHOOLERS WILL get the most fun out of Disney's animated story about an elegant mother cat, Duchess, and her three kittens from Paris, and their sassy country hero, a tomcat named O'Malley, voiced by Phil Harris. Eva Gabor provides the voice for Angora Duchess of the blue eyes and fluffy white tail, while Robie Lester gives her a singing voice.    Unfortunately, once past the age of five, more sophisticated palettes will enjoy the kitty antics found on [...] or in DreamWorks' \\"Puss In Boots.\\" \\"The Aristocats\\" was made in the `70s at a time when animation was deemed suitable only for the very youngest. It was a strange statement coming from the studio that traditionally delivered groundbreaking animation such as \\"Fantasia,\\" \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" - whose story this film so resembles - \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\" and other memorable favorites that appeal to young and old.    There are a few songs by the Sherman Brothers, Robert B. and Richard M., who also penned the score for \\"Mary Poppins\\" and its Oscar-Winner Best Song, \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee.\\" They're amusing, especially \\"Scales and Arpeggios,\\" sung by Duchess and her kittens, and the opening title number. \\"The Aristocats\\" was the last song recorded by Maurice Chevalier, who was retired at the time of the Sherman's request. Richard describes how he got Chevalier to come out of retirement in the best extra, \\"The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs.\\" Other extras include deleted scenes and a song, \\"She Never Felt Alone,\\" alternate story treatments, and a music video, \\"Oui Oui, Marie.\\"    On the Blu-ray disc, we also get an excerpt, \\"The Great Cat Family,\\" from an old Disney TV show and a cartoon, \\"Bath Day,\\" with Figaro the kitten and Minnie Mouse.    Shifting to the DVD for other extras, we notice the big difference between the restored high-definition picture and its old DVD version. Colors are richer and brighter, definition is much better and dirt and scratches have mostly been removed for the Blu-ray. These two presentations, even while the HD version is not reference, are like day and night. The DVD duplicates a few extras found on the Blu-ray, a nice consideration for the non-upgraded player in the house. There are a few simple games and features, too, such as a Virtual Kitten that can be played as a DVD-ROM.    This story tells how the butler did it. Overhearing the terms of his mistress' will that leaves her fortune to her cats - and then to her butler - he decides to move things along by dumping the cats out in the country. It's O'Malley to the rescue, guiding Mama Duchess and her babies home to the mansion by way of songs, new friends and adventures.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|When Voyager first hit the airways I was not impressed.  TO be honest, Janeway was the reason why.  She was extremely stiff and inflexible in the first season; even more than Picard in TNG.  But I was so head-in-clouds over Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 that I acknowledged not really giving the show a fair chance.  So I decided to watch it from the beginning.  And I will write high level reviews for each season, not each episode.<br /><br />Season 1's focus is the crew getting adjusted to life in the Delta Quadrant as well as the merging of Maquis and Starfleet members into a cohesive crew.  This struggle makes for some good writing early on as you would definitely expect some conflicts, but there were some missed opportunities for sabotage.  Episodes like \\"State of Flux\\" which sets the foundation for one of the most interesting backstories in Voyager (Seska) and \\"Learning Curve\\" where they showcase some stragglers that just didn't make the full transition to Starfleet life.  The most obvious negative is that they never fully explored the latter; after a while, people just start flowing along happily, which given the story of the Maquis told in Deep Space Nine, should really been more challenging.<br /><br />There were some head scratcher episodes, such as \\"Time and Again\\" where it causes a headache thinking about what's going on (which is the reason it's generally not a good idea to tell a time travel-related story), and you can't help but think back to TNG's \\"Time's Arrow\\" where Data experiences generally the same idea; that you can encounter an event today that both hasn't and has happened.  Trust me when I say that the episode does make sense, but it will give you some migraines trying to sort through the chronology of everything.  Even worse is the idea that Janeway can affect the flow of time by realizing the paradox, thus preventing the event that caused them to be in the situation in the first place (thus creating another paradox).<br /><br />Other episodes,like \\"Emanations\\" are filler and do little to further the series.  Annoyances that are better left out of the canon, but we're stuck with nonetheless.  \\"Prime Factors\\" is actually a well-told story marred by poor character interactions and illogical behavior (Tuvok).<br /><br />It's clear from the episode progression that the writers were trying to use this opportunity to work with characters and storylines that they could not have in the other Star Trek versions.  Being in the Delta Quadrant meant they could make up characters at a whim, and throwing the Maquis in there gave them \\"bad guys\\" without much effort.  The problem is that the approach is so haphazard that it will be difficult to really be interested in seeing more seasons, but the first season is necessary to really enjoy some of what comes later.
B005LAJ212|5.0|A LITTLE GIRL loses her father when he's betrayed by the woman he loves, framed for terrorist acts, and killed in prison. The child is sent to a juvenile prison after defending herself from abuse in a foster home. When freed at 18-years, Amanda Clarke becomes heir to a fortune of obscene proportion and her father's journals, outlining his set-up and innocence. Now, taking on the identity of wealthy socialite and philanthropist Emily Thorne, she brings justice to those who ruined her father's life and her own ... justice designed to suit each enemy's individual role.<br /><br />We haven't seen determination like this since The Bride in Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill\\" movies - or \\"The Dark Knight.\\" In a bravura performance by Emily VanCamp, our girl hasn't beheaded anyone yet, but her schemes are definitely lethal for those she takes aim at. And there are plenty of them in a cast that includes Madeline Stowe (\\"The Last of the Mohicans\\") and Henry Czerny as Victoria and Conrad Grayson, the veddy rich, veddy bad monarchs of The Hamptons where the story takes place. As you might have noticed in USA's \\"Royal Pains,\\" The Hamptons is the playground of the American wealthy. \\"It's a great place for a fantasy background,\\" VanCamp says in the making-of extra, \\"Roadmap to Revenge.\\"<br /><br />In the same feature, creator Mike Kelley tells us, \\"Revenge is the mother of all story engines for me ... a loss of love and family - that betrayal - are such strong motivators for any protagonist.\\"<br /><br />Co-executive producer/writer Mark B. Perry and Kelley advise the classic revenge tale by Alexander Dumas, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo,\\" went into the pitch for \\"Revenge.\\" \\"I was a huge fan of the book and I felt like this was a real opportunity to bring the nighttime soap opera back,\\" Kelley says.<br /><br />Executive producer Marty Bowen chimes in saying, \\"For me, at its core, it's more opera than soap opera.\\"<br /><br />OK, but the only time \\"Revenge\\" drags is when the story spins off in a tangent of love and family angst. When it sticks to Emily and her mission, this thriller is like a page turner that keeps us up into the wee hours. I couldn't stop watching this mash of murder, betrayal, blackmail and potent justice. Maybe Emily should wear a mask and a cape, but, when not styling like a 21st Century Grace Kelly, she's deliciously menacing in a black hoodie, jeans and boots.<br /><br />In the extra, \\"Haute Hamptons: Femme Fatale Fashions,\\" VanCamp tells us that Emily's socialite persona is modeled after iconic movie star Grace Kelly. Costume designer Jill Ohanneson (\\"Dexter,\\" \\"Six Feet Under,\\" \\"Lie to Me\\") says she spoke to VanCamp and Stowe about their feelings and their models for clothing inspiration. Audrey Hepburn, Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly certainly work for VanCamp. Stowe's look is \\"a little bit dangerous and very sensual, but still elegant and a little bit aggressive,\\" Ohanneson says.<br /><br />\\"I really didn't want this character to be the typical society matron. I wanted her to have a more feline sense of her character, and Jill really went with that,\\" Stowe confirms.<br /><br />The cast is not so serious it can't make fun of their trappings, however. In the bloopers extra, Czerny, the deadly businessman, cries out in a scene, \\"Help - Help! My daughter is wearing some pink thing and the bedding is mauve! Mauve, can't you see it?\\"<br /><br />Nice when the bloopers actually make you laugh. Additional extras on this 22 episode, five disc set from ABC Studios include deleted scenes on each disc, two music videos, an interview with Emily's frequently reluctant ally played by Gabriel Mann (\\"The Bourne Identity,\\" \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\"), \\"Nolan Ross Exposed.\\" \\"At Home in the Hamptons,\\" is where we learn Wilmington, N.C., substituted for The Hamptons in the pilot episode. Sets constructed afterward feature replicas of a grand estate, a seaside cottage (to die for!) and a neighborhood bar, renamed Porter's Stowaway Tavern for the series. \\"At Home\\" also shows how the use of green screen brings these sets to life with breathtaking seasonal views.<br /><br />Critics and viewers loved the first season of \\"Revenge\\"; it was a certifiable hit for ABC, nominated for Golden Globe and Viewers Choice awards. Season Two premiers at 9 p.m., Sept. 30.
1936608898|4.0|This book is a good summary and further exploration of the whole 30 and other topics covered in articles on the Whole 9 blog.  It explains the why behind the paleo diet and how to do a whole 30 without going into the detail of an academic article.  The recipes are not the most exciting but good for people just starting to follow this way of eating.  I say couple this with one of the really good paleo/primal diet (primal palate, well fed, etc..) and you are all set for this journey.

I talked about it so much my friend decided to read and she ended up LOVING IT! Its just amazing. I got it because my mom told me that it sounded interesting ( She hates reading but I love it! ) so I decided to read it and couldn't put it down!

0425263908|2.0|Blah blah Blah....this might as well have been 50 Shades of Grey, same basic story line...Guy has crappy childhood and becomes a dominant because of it. I really wish these authors who wanted to dabble into kinky sex wouldn't get their books listed as BDSM fantasy, there's nothing about this book that is BDSM really. Yes I know it's supposed to be a fantasy story, but let's face it the majority of the world isn't rich and there are plenty of people out there who have healthy BDSM relationships that didn't come out of someone's mommy issues. If you've got to read one, read 50 Shades instead, at least there's some humor thrown in that series. There's also a good mystery plot and a lot of action. This book really was just a boring read, the sex was the same thing over and over and over. It was not hot and steamy, and really I only just finished it because I thought at some point it might get better and I hate leaving a book unfinished.<br /><br />If it's really wild kinky fetish fantasy novels you want I would recommend The Beauty Trilogy or The Market Place series. These are purely fantasy, but they have much more hot and steamy moments, with more kink than most can handle. If you want to learn more about BDSM I recommend Screw The Roses Send Me the Thorns or actually talking with people who actually participate in the lifestyle.

0486406482|4.0|Jane Austen's works are an extreme favorite of mine but this is not my favorite.  Emma is really snobby and a meddler.  Hers is not a personality I would want others to emulate but she is well meaning.  Mr. Knightley is the best character of all.  There are several very fun characters in this novel.
B0086700CM|4.0|I liked it but after awile you get bored of it and need another game to play when you get bored.
0674049160|4.0|I do enjoy the visuals in this book which is a key to what makes it different.  I personally didn't find it as satisfying as David Shapard's version however.  I felt it was a bit cumbersome and some of the annotations take up way too much room.  Some of the wording is not for the average reader but more for the scholarly in my opinion.

0486295559|5.0|This is my favorite Austen work.  it's a bit more mature than her other works.  Love lost and regained.  This also shows how a young woman can mature into a self-confident and very responsible young woman in the face of a daunting and selfish family.  Mrs. Smith who is Miss anne Eliot's close friend and the description of her character in the book is much more enjoyable than any of the movie versions can portray.
1593083564|4.0|This is one of my least favorite austen novels however it is still very well written.  It's merely the unspeakable way that Fanny Price is treated for the majority of this novel.  The Crawfords make this truly memorable.  Fanny does have a happy ending.
0345803485|1.0|Well I am only a quarter through this monstrosity.  The author obviously read Twilight and used bunches of Meyer's ideas and dialect. The scatterbrained mom, virgin skinny pale daughter, love of classic books, blah blah. What a ripoff.  The book is dull and stupid and really a pathetic attempt at writing.  So the author was feeling kinda horny and wrote a book about it?  That is all I have got so far.  Won't bother finishing it.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|Tarsem Singh's \\"Immortals\\" is a Greek mythology-inspired film that is beautiful to look at, but is slow-moving and even dull at times. Set in 1228 B.C., the story is about the ruthless King Hyperion (scenery-chewing Mickey Rourke), who intends to conquer the worlds of both gods and humans by unleashing the \\"Titans.\\" The only person who can stop the brutal king's rampage is a stonemason Theseus (Henry Cavill), who is also a formidable warrior trained by an old man (John Hurt) since his childhood.<br /><br />The story is pretty boring and full of plot holes. With its sluggish pace and several unnecessary episodes involving the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and the \\"Epirus Bow\\" that only confuse the viewer, \\"The Immortals\\" is only sporadically entertaining.<br /><br />\\"Immortals\\" doesn't know its target audience. I don't have an issue with the film's violent content, but as an adventure tale the film takes itself too seriously. As a revenge tale, it lacks credible characters. Also, the film might have taken too much liberty with the Greek mythology. I know the film is not made as educational material, but the idea of Zeus (Luke Evans) strictly forbidding other gods to interfere is something very strange.<br /><br />\\"Immortals\\" is the third feature film directed by Tarsem Singh (following \\"The Cell\\" and \\"The Fall\\"). He is generally known for his unique visual styles, which is again one of the assets of \\"Immortals.\\" Oscar-winning designer Eiko Ishioka (who has worked for all the films Tarsem directed, including his latest \\"Mirror, Mirror\\") provides interesting costumes.<br /><br />But let's face it. Despite his flair for visual sophistication and impact (see the brilliant scene of the imprisoned Titans, for instance), Tarsem Singh is not the greatest storyteller in the film industry. Combat sequences need better editing that would create a seamless and natural flow of action. As it is, \\"Immortals\\" is a collection of beautifully crafted bits of footage randomly assembled. \\"Immortals\\" is visually impressive, but its narrative needs improvement.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|\\"Redshirts\\" is a highly entertaining send up, really a pastiche, of the original Star Trek series. These are the voyages of the Starship Intrepid, flagship of the United Federation of Planets, errr, sorry the Universal Union. There is a captain Abernathy, a Spock-like first officer (Q'eeng), a astrogator who his a combination of Chekov and Sulu (Kerensky), and a bunch of new recruits. The new recruits quickly realize that anyone chosen for an away mission, as long as Abernathy, Q'ueeng or Kerensky is along, stand a far better than average chance of being killed by a variety of Borgovian land worms or Moravian  melting plague or some such horror. The new recruits, with the help of a mysterious crewman missing for years and believed dead who haunts the internal service corridors of the the ship come up win an astounding hypothesis: they are actually extras in some sort of cheesy TV series and are simply following the \\"Narrative\\" or script written by some one else long ago, where the stalwart stars always survive but the extras are fodder for death by ice sharks and dread diseases.<br /><br />Using all the well-worn tropes of Star Trek episodes of the past, the extras band together and decide to go on a suicide mission to try to see if the hypothesis is correct and to do something about it. I found the whole thing a hoot and laughed out loud several times. I think this one is strictly for fans of the original Star Trek, who I think will enjoy this enormously. Others may find it a bit silly, so those of you out there who didn't grow up on Kirk, Spock, McCoy and having all the extras in red shirts killed off before the first commercial might want to take a pass on this one. Me, I loved it.<br /><br />The writing is more than serviceable and I (unlike some other reviewers) found the 3 codas a nice addition, especially the last one.  It has not escaped my attention that there are a number of trolls and others out there who just don't \\"get\\" this novel, expecting it to be a straight-up sci-fi space opera, and not a Star Trek spoof.  They will no doubt give this review a bunch of \\"not helpfuls\\", not because the review is not helpful, but because I dared to give it 4 stars and say that I enjoyed it.

1455502758|5.0|This is a wonderful book, both serious to the point of tears and incredibly funny.  He had me laughing out loud.  It is very short and I've already read it twice.  He was an outspoken man, particularly about religious belief (or rather the lack of it) but he had many friends on all sides from serious believers to non-believers.  The book is full of wisdom and profound insights.  Although Christopher was always insightful, the death sentence of stage four cancer seems to have immensely sharpened his wit  We have lost a great man and a poignant voice.  His family must miss him dreadfully.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.  I'm trying to decide which ones of my lucky friends to share it with.
0060936223|5.0|I'm adding \\"Just Kids\\" by Patti Smith to my list of 'Favorite Books EVER.\\" Why:<br />1. Patti Smith is an amazing icon, known as the Mother of Rock and Grandmom of Punk.<br /><br />This book begins before she went to New York with a suitcase and dreams in her pocket. She spends her first summer in NYC sleeping in parks. Eventually she meets Robert Mapplethorpe-- the muse of this book-- and they team up together as friends, lovers, and partners.<br /><br />Patti runs into an unbelievable number of famous people including Jimi Hendrix. This book is an incredible look into the origins of modern rock, and the cast that made that up.<br /><br />2. Patti Smith writes as a touching memorial of Robert Mapplethorpe after his death from HIV.<br /><br />At first Patti and Robert were friends, then they became lovers, and later, partners. Their relationship is really interesting as Robert comes to terms with his sexuality--what it means to want men sexually but to love a woman so strongly.<br /><br />There is nothing uncomplicated about their love, but it is clearly of enormous importance to Patti Smith.<br /><br />The book is filled with visual images, most of which are photographs taken by Robert.<br /><br />3. Set in the turn of the sixties to the seventies, it's remarkable how little has changed today.<br /><br />Although culture began to explode with new forms of expression-- rock and rock, BDSM, photography, spoken word-- the context seems familiar.<br /><br />Patti Smith puts into words the difficulty of being an artist in today's world. The challenge of finding an apartment in New York, finding yourself, finding your voice when your parents would rather you find a 9 to 5. The grit and the anguish lurking in the Chelsea Hotel mixed with the light of collaboration and inspiration. Robert is a social butterfly while Patti hesitates on the fringe of the<br /><br />creative society that decides 'who's in' because why should she have to pander to them or anyone?<br /><br />It'd be no less scary today for someone to realize they are gay, or to struggle with making a niche as an artist.<br /><br />4. Patti Smith is a dreamer, a poet and a wannabe musician with blocks and no idea where she is going.<br /><br />Patti's introverted, prefers free-writing spontaneity, and spends ages trying to figure out how the hell to write a song. She has only a hand full of friends even though Robert drags her to every event he goes to. That's not her scene, she's the quiet type.<br /><br />She's the kind of girl someone might question is really an artist until she found exactly the venue she needed for her talents. She had the passion, the will and the patience to get herself there when Robert was her main support.<br /><br />I really see myself and Patti Smith as in the same boat. I'm a starting writer and I definitely know how hard it is to write songs! Introverted as well, I like the way Patti sees the world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves early Rock and Roll, poetry, art, or the promise of New York City.<br /><br />For more reviews please visit my blog [...]niche as an artist.    4.

1469984202|5.0|A friend had recommended these, and based on my past experience with inexpensive kindle books that appear to be self-published/ebook only, I did not have extremely high hopes.

B0085Z3AMW|3.0|Everything \\"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers\\" accomplished by bringing back the masked knife-wielding maniac with an injection of Hitchcockian suspense was demolished by the fifth installment in the franchise. \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\\" is a sad attempt at taking the back story of the killer and expanding upon it. This movie is the perfect example of producers and screenwriters trying to make more out of something than is possible. Anchor Bay's release of the film on Blu-ray gives fans a chance to revisit it and scratch their head in bewilderment at the ridiculous subplot alluded to.<br /><br />A year has passed since Michael Myer's (Don Shanks) young niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) mentally broke down after being stalked by the killer. The attack on her step-mother leads to her admittance into a children's psychiatric hospital. Michael survived the mine collapse and shares a psychic link with Jamie. Now mute, she must find a way to communicate her painful visions to her step-sister (Ellie Cornell) and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Meanwhile, a strange man arrives in Haddonfield with sinister intentions for Myers.<br /><br />Where part four showed very little, this fifth installment went the other direction and featured Myers visually stabbing his victims with pitchforks, his hands, and butcher knives. Director Dominique Othenin-Girard leaves nothing to the imagination. Besides subtle nuances like the psychic connection between Michael and his niece Jamie and the unnecessary attempt at a subplot with the stranger in black, this is a generic slasher film through and through.<br /><br />Danielle Harris is perfect as the mute Jamie. She thrashes around and cries without making sounds. She is completely convincing in the role. Donald Pleasance delivers a stellar performance in a movie that really doesn't justify his effort. He could've just walked through this one and been better than any of his co-stars minus Harris.<br /><br />What the movie lacks in content quality it makes up for with its superb high-definition audio and video presentation. The picture is clean and vibrant and the 5.1 surround sound enhances the experience with a familiar mix of John Carpenter's signature musical score, the screams of Michael's victims, and the sounds of slashing and crashing.<br /><br />There are enough special features included to get hardcore \\"Halloween\\" fans excited. Two separate audio commentaries with actors Don Shanks, Danielle Harris, and Jeffrey Landham and director Dominique Othenin-Girard and author Justin Beahm give insight into the making of the film. A featurette entitled \\"'Halloween 5:' On the Set\\" is also found. There's a theatrical trailer and original promo as well.<br /><br />The new \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\\" Blu-ray release spotlights one of the weaker entries in the franchise. It's mildly entertaining and still has excellent performances by Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasance which need to be seen. Just don't expect a repeat of part four's quality going into it and you'll be alright. Fans and completists will find it necessary to pick up this chapter of the Michael Myers' saga immediately.cks in content quality it makes up for with its superb high-definition audio and video presentation.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok so many women wish Christian Grey were real,  myself included.  But it's not just about the Red Room and all it has to offer.  It is so much more than that.  The basis of this book is a love story.  One that crosses a lot of boundaries but at the heart of it is about unconditional love and what we are willing to do for the one we love.  The forgiveness we have, the need to protect our loved ones, the sacrifices we make.  It's all worth it in the end to find someone who loves us that much.  All of the other sexy bits were great, but I mostly enjoyed the love Christian and Ana had for each other.

The characters develop along with the series...which is fun.  Keep in mind:  One person's \\"Oh My God!\\" is another person's friday night...it's best to keep an open mind if you're interested in reading these books.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It is not a run of the mill book. It has depth and underlying tones that mean something. It is somewhat of a niche post-apocolyptic series, but with twists and turns that arent there just to keep you guessing but genuinely propel the story further. I am a very eclectic reader without any one style of book that I prefer, so i come acroos alot of different styles of book that I put down. I did not put this book down. I found that I cared for the characters and their situations. I felt their fears and their struggles and I was engaged. Getting way to mad at fictional characters for doing fictional things. I loved this series. I am very excited for the future of this story as well as spinoffs I have heard are coming. If you like to be passionate about what you are reading this is your book. I hope this review helps you choose this book. If it doesn't, please consider the fact that its due to my poor reviewing. Enjoy

1936608898|5.0|I have been doing Paleo/ Whole 30 for a year and 5 months. I have lost about 100 lbs, most of which I had already lot by the beginning of this year. I was introduced in to this lifestyle by reading Robb Wolf's. \\"The Paleo Solution\\" And I had the great support of my teammates at Team Crossfit Academy in Monrovia California. Then I attended a seminar by Dallas and Melissa about 8 months ago. People often ask me how to do the same thing that I have done. I try my hardest to explain in my own words what they should do. I really care. But when it comes down to it, you have to try it. And if you don't understand how I explain it. Or it sounds too hard. Then you should seek another source for the information. People like me do understand what you are going through. We get frustrated to see our loved ones struggle through life the way we once did. I would give anything to hep someone the way Robb, Dallas and Melissa have helped me through their books. I don't know if I understood it better than anybody. Or maybe I was just desperate enough at the time to try it. So anyway about the book. If you have read the Paleo Solution like I did before reading this book. Its totally different yet it is basically the same information. But I do think its worth the money. I think you definitely benefit from this book. Realize that your whole life the media and the government have been feeding you really wrong information about health. Worse than that your bodies are more than likely addicted to foods that are detrimental to your health. It would be nice to get a graduate level education on nutrition but the reality is we struggle with our lives and need someone to tell us what we need to know to get healthier. And you will get healthier if you follow Dallas and Melissa's advice. Realize also that as you get healthier you will be spending less time in the doctors office and more time enjoying life. How can you put a price on that?
030758836X|5.0|This is a love it or hate it kind of book, as I think the reviews here reflect. I came down on the side of love it---it's amazing.<br /><br />If you need a likeable narrator, this book is not for you. The voices of this book are consistently fascinating, but deeply, deeply, hidiously, twistedly, deliciously flawed.<br /><br />If you need a tidiness in the ending, this book is not for you. There's been a lot of kerfluffle about it, but I thought the end was note perfect. It was the best kind of conclusion, by which I mean, it surprised me and at the same time I had this dawning feeling that it was inevitable. The book could not have ended so truthfully in any other way.<br /><br />It reminds me of IN THE WOODS, another book whose end polarized readers, and which  I loved as much as I loved this one. I can also see fans of THE SECRET HISTORY or Jennifer McMahon's DISMANTLED eating this up like candy. If you liked any of those, this is probably right up your alley.
B006LSZECO|3.0|As the title of my review states, the first half is better than the second half.  I was engrossed in the details the author wrote about the evolution of the main characters as a married couple.  Many of the details are so very thought out.  The actual story line of the book on the otherhand was so-so.  I feel like this story has been done many times.  I kept waiting for something new and \\"wow\\" to enter the scene and nothing ever did.  As many of the other reviewers stated, I was also not too attached to the main characters which wasn't a good thing because I could really care less what happened to them.  The end of the book also was a \\"really??\\" moment. I kept clicking forward on my Kindle hoping there was more story to actually conclude the book.  All in all this is a so-so read.

As strange as this may seem, there are probably a few people out there that may find this film a little off color or somewhat offensive. I think its actually a little too wimpy of a story line, But that's only my opinion. You will have to see it for your self.<br />Have to watch a couple more times for the nuances now.
B005GSY23M|5.0|This album is a quandary but it's excellent. Not many tracks with voice but the one's that do are powerful.

B008GOAFBQ|5.0|KISS' fifth album Destroyer was released in March of 1976.<br />The album was the band's long-awaited followup to the monstrously successful live album, 1975's Alive!. Alive! was the album that made KISS a household name but its followup immortalized KISS forever.<br />The band entered The Record Plant in January, 1976 (the month I was born mind you) with legendary producer Bob Ezrin (famed for work up to that point with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed and would subsequently work with Peter Gabriel and Pink Floyd) to create their classic contribution to rock history. I first got this tape by mistake in July of 1988 and the chance paid off, KISS' best studio release from the make-up years (I now have the remastered CD). On this album, rhythm guitarist/singer Paul Stanley, bass player/singer Gene Simmons, lead guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss peaked as a band.<br />We open with a news reading and intro of the fan going to a concert and cranking \\"Rock and Roll All Night\\" on his tape deck (either cassette or 8-track (this was 1976 mind you) into the rocker \\"Detroit Rock City\\" (penned by Stanley and Ezrin) which is a tale of a fan going to see a rock and roll concert only to die. The crash segues into the classic \\"King Of the Night Time World\\" which is also sung and penned by Stanley and Ezrin with Mark Anthony and famed Runaways svengali Kim Fowley. Next is the Stanley penned sinister rocker \\"God of Thunder\\" (sung by Gene and would be his bass solo/blood spewing number and also was Peter Criss' drum solo spot for many years). The first side ends with Gene's grand theatrical number \\"Great Expectations\\" which featured choirs, strings and bells.<br />Then we have \\"Flaming Youth\\" which was penned by Paul and Ace and Ezrin. We follow with the Simmons penned rocker \\"Sweet Pain\\" (which featured famed Bob Ezrin session player Dick Wagner playing lead guitar here). Next was the first single \\"Shout it Out Loud\\" which was a Top 40 stomping anthemic rocker penned by Stanley/Simmons/Ezrin. Next was the ballad \\"Beth\\", which was written and sung by Peter. The song was a love ballad and seen as the band as a throwaway song and initially was the flip side to \\"Detroit Rock City\\" before DJ's flipped the 45 over and played \\"Beth\\" and the song reached #7 on the US charts. The closing \\"Do You Love Me\\" is a great rocker as well. Just when you thought it was over on the original album, it ends with the collage of sound effects a/k/a Rock and Roll Party with the choir from Great Expectations and was on the original LP, CD and CD remaster of Destroyer.<br />Destroyer remains KISS' greatest triumph and biggest selling studio album (Triple Platinum in US sales) as it reached #11 on the US charts. Today, Destroyer sounds great and has aged very well!<br />Now in 2012, the album has been re-released with a new remix painstakingly done by original producer Bob Ezrin and excellent remastering done by mastering engineer legend Bob Ludwig (who did mastering on many classic albums by The Rolling Stones, Rush, Bruce Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and remasterings of the catalogs of The Rolling Stones, Queen, Rush (1997 remasters), Springsteen and Dire Straits to name a few). The remix is excellent and features some bits and pieces that were not on the original mix (like Ace's guitar solo on \\"Sweet Pain\\" which was left off the original album for Dick Wagner's solo (which is here as a bonus track), acoustic guitar on \\"Beth\\" not present on the original mix, extra backing vocals and so forth and so on which were left off so the sound for vinyl would not be bad). I know there's a glitch on \\"Flaming Youth\\" but it was either an error on CD or mixing itself but is not bothersome. Also contains a brilliant essay written by Bob Ezrin and some photos and the original front cover painting which was rejected by Casablanca Records back in the day as being \\"too violent\\". Then the CD looks like the original vinyl record (the first issue with blue Casablanca label) and is alsocolored black (mirroring how the CD for the 2005 remaster of Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run appeared). I know many are griping and complaining \\"it's a money grab\\" and \\"no unreleased material\\" but the mix is how Bob Ezrin and KISS intended the original album how to sound back in 1976.<br />Highly recommended!colored black (mirroring how the CD for the 2005 remaster of Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run appeared).

When I came back to get another one, I had to abandon the purchase -- along with a 32-gig microsdhc card -- because I would have had to pad the order to get it to ship. Avoiding padding orders is the reason I bought Amazon Prime in the first place. So Amazon Prime is not \\"better\\" as Bezos says in his little front page note today. It's just slightly more bogus.

B005FMZVLQ|5.0|First of all - great service from Amazon. Item was shipped to Sweden within 2 days. That is extraordinary!<br />Well packaged. It came in this expensive-looking invicta box, wich was in turn inside a protective box, inside a bigger box filled with bubblepaper. Boxception!<br />Second of all - amazing watch. Excellent quality, extremely well built. Nice work in details and engravings.<br />Looks great, feels great, works perfectly!<br />I got excactly what I wanted, and more.<br /><br />Some notes about the function:<br />The second hand has ticking motion - not sweeping.<br />Shows date at 4 o'clock.<br />Chronograph function: Small hand at 6 o'clock shows 1/20 of a second. The hand at 12 o'clock shows seconds, and the 3 o'clock hand shows minutes.<br />When one minute has passed, the 1/20 hand will stop at 0, only to display fractions of seconds when the cronograph is stopped.<br />It is possible to stop the chrono, and start it again from that time (to pause it). Chepaer models often don't have this simple function.<br />It is also possible to display laptimes, without stopping the counter.<br />When the chrono is reset, the 1/20 hand will complete one revolution until it's reset, and the second hand will do as many revolutions as the minute hand is showing, thus slowly ticking the minute hand down to zero (or up to zero depending on what the minute hand is displaying at the time). The motion is fast, though.<br />The hands will take the shortest route to zero.<br />If, say, the minute hand shows 29 minutes, it will reverse back to zero.<br />If the minute hand shows 31 minutes, it will move forward to zero.<br /><br />I bought this strictly for the chrono-function, and I'm in no way dissapointed.<br />This is my third Invicta-watch.<br />True quality.

0812550706|1.0|I have attempted to read this several times over the past ten years, and I finally made it through. Science fiction has never been one of my interests, so please take this review with that in mind.<br /><br />Ender Wiggin is a prodigy who is recruited from Earth into an elite battle school for children to find the next battle commander who will lead them to victory against the alien \\"Buggers.\\" As a 10-year-old, he is younger then the other children, and is isolated. The adults pulls on the strings in Ender's life like marionette operators to cause the desired results. I'll stop the story there in case you do know about the semi-surprise ending. Someone told me about the ending, but it really did not matter.<br /><br />Overall, it was a mildly interesting story and a good quick read. My main problem from early in the novel is that they had all these little kids arguing and discussing military philosophy as though they were college professors. It all felt so forced and phony. I never could buy that Ender is a child. This is also true with his older siblings, Peter and Valentine. There is a completely ridiculous sub-plot about the two of them assuming false identities and writing a revolutionary doctrine that changed the course of the war. Silly.<br /><br />I'm probably alone in my opinions, as I know that this is a much-loved book in the sci-fi genre. Sorry to offend anyone, but it just isn't that good.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|It does start off a bit slow, but this is a very well written and fairly intricate story that will have you living the story right along with the biographer. I read so many books that I'm rarely surprised by author's attempts at twists and turns. But I was actually surprised by some of the outcomes in The Thirteenth Tale. Really great read.
0930289234|5.0|Before you judge the inclusion of a graphic novel here, know that this is over 400 pages of powerful, unique storytelling that happens to be in the graphic novel format. When it came out in 1985, it was one of the first stories that took a different look at superheroes and comic books. Without Watchmen, there would be no Dark Knight.<br /><br />The story takes place in an alternate 1985 America, where we won the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon is still president. There are no humans with super powers, only masked crime fighters--adventurers--who help clean up the streets. After the Keene Act, vigilantism is declared illegal, and the heroes retire or go to work with the government. One of these is Edward Blake (the Comedian), whose less-than-honorable ways have made him a successful soldier-for-hire. Another is Dr. Manhattan, the only person with real super powers. Dr. Manhattan works for the U.S. government, and keeps a check on the approaching Soviets by tipping the balance of power in America's favor.<br /><br />The story opens with Rorschach, an illegal crime fighter with an heightened sense of justice, searching for answers in the murder of Edward Blake. He uncovers a plot to kill the former adventurers in an attempt to remove Dr. Manhattan, and perhaps to have world-conquering implications.<br /><br />There are many layers to this excellent story: the comparison to this America to the actual 1985's America; the story-within-a-story about the Black Freighter; the question on what heroes do when they are done saving the world; and, the most interesting to me, Rorschach's moral justice versus the other characters. The character is perhaps one of the most compelling characters, both good and depraved in the same man. His mask is Rorschack inkblots, black and white with no place for gray.<br /><br />If you are interested in the graphic novel format, I'd suggest giving this a go. It is a real page-turner.

0099579936|1.0|What a disappointment. I was so excited to read this. How on earth did this book become so popular? I'm disgusted at myself for reading as much as I did as there is no substance or plot worth reading. I truly do not understand how this book has received so much hype. It's glorified domestic abuse IMO. There is nothing for me to write in this review that hasn't already been said 500000 times in other poor reviews. Flat, one dimensional characters that are shameful.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I borrowed [[ASIN:B004J4WKTW The Night Circus]] as a kindle book from my local library.  I didn't finish it.  The book just didn't grab me but I can't say I didn't think it was a good book.  While I was reading it I went back and read some of the reviews.  A lot of the 3 and 2 star reviews describe the same book I was reading.  I thought it was going to be so much better.  I don't really think this a SPOILER  but one character<br />had their childhood described ( in a couple paragraphs )  as being spent locked in an apartment with really little or no contact just reading books and occasionally was taken on a outing to a museum and it made me think of child abuse.  And remember this is being locked in before electricity.<br />  I might go back and  try to read it some other time but right now I'm moving on to something else.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|love this dvd. aalways waned to know more about this beatle, but could not find much material. recommend this to others who enjoy the beatles
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Got these primarily for home recording both on PC and iPad--which they are great for. Vivid, mostly accurate sound with very good bass and treble that's a bit extreme. I've had them for about a month now and the high treble does mellow over time, so I no longer feel the need to use an equalizer to bring down the high frequencies.<br /><br />Music sounds terrific too. I'm comparing these to my Grado 60's (Nice too but not for recording)and a pair of JM Lab bookshelf speakers. They also sound very good through portable devices without extra amplification.<br /><br />What they are not good for is use in public, as all headphones with this design leak sound that will annoy your neighbors on a plane or train. I also threw a cut pair of socks (new ones)over the pads to eliminate sweaty ear syndrome.<br /><br />Overall - if you don't need complete isolation these are a great value with intro audiophile sound that's accurate enough for home recording.
B006CC0Y0Q|5.0|Well, no need to say that this is an extremely good LP. I think I like it best than Bumblegum,<br />but for only a little. There is no doubt there is extremely fine music here.<br /><br />The vinyl edition comes with two coloured vinyl. It's pretty cool; they are \\"phantasmagoria gray\\" colored.<br />It's really a nice object. You won't regret if you buy this. Extremely recommendable.
0307341577|5.0|Dark Places is a prior novel by the author of Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn. It is darker, more gut wrenching, and without the touch of lightness in Gone Girl. I felt like a witness to a Greek Tragedy of a gory and tragic slow-motion car crash. One can only hope for a scrap of redemption at the end. Although graphic when necessary, nothing in Dark Places is gratuitous or sadistic. Gillian Flynn is moving up the list of my favorite authors.

1451627289|5.0|I have never been into the \\"horror\\" of Steven King, but my daughter talked me into reading this book.  Honestly, I'm only half way through it, but it had me pretty much from the beginning.  I can't wait to get to the end to find out what happens!!!

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This is an amazingly beautiful book about an appalling subject.  By now, everyone knows the 16 year old son of Eva, who writes long letters to her now-estranged husband, Franklin, has murdered seven students and two adults in a school killing, much like Columbine and others across the U.S.  Eva revisits their decision to have a child even though they were happy without children, the difficult early years with Kevin, his preference for Franklin's company, and her feelings of rejection by them. She writes eloquently of her ostracism in her town now that \\"Thursday\\" has happened, and the unkind way in which she has been portrayed by the press as a monster, a cold mother. Eva expounds about her feelings of guilt for her dislike of their home, chosen by Franklin, in a trophy neighborhood in a lovely suburb far removed from her preferred city environment, and its ruin by vandals armed with blood-red enamel after the massacre.  She describes the joy she experienced with the birth of her daughter, when Kevin was seven, and how different the two children are in their connection to her from birth.  Her lament that her daughter is with Franklin is deeply painful: you feel her loneliness viscerally.  It is not until on reaches nearly the end of the book that the true horror of the situation hits you, the reader, in full force.  Eva continues to visit Kevin in the juvenile facility in which he is confined despite her very mixed feelings about and for him, and their unresolved relationship will color her future for the rest of her days.
B006N57PXG|3.0|Mediocre story, good protagonist interesting spin on the world of wizards and their training.  Will not read others in the series
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The novel was very interesting.  The plot moved along always keeping you guessing what was really going to happen!  I should have guessed the ending, but I didn't....If you like Baldacci's other novels, you will enjoy this one.  This was my first email/kindle paperback purchase for vacation.  I have always purchased paperback for the beach/pool area.  Decided to give the Kindle a try and it was an easy transition.  Will I never read a paperback again-NO, will I only use the Kindle again, NO.  The Innocent was easy to pick up when ever I had to stop reading for an hour,day or week.  Purchasing the book online was fast and easy, no issues at all.  Downloaded in under a minute with my FIOS/fibre optic connection.

0345803485|1.0|If I could, I would not give this book any stars, but I am forced to give it one; this is way too generous. I can't imagine what Random House was thinking in publishing it! E.L.James may be able to write a competent business letter, and if she can, she should stick to that! The drivel she calls a novel has boring, self-involved, spoiled characters and the most redundant writing possible. It is \\"Dick and Jane\\" for porn seekers. The same few words and phrases repeated over and over and over again, ad  nauseum. And porn is all that it is; badly written porn. You'd be better off buying a \\"Penthouse\\" and reading the Forum section. The letters are more imaginative and better written.<br /><br />Please, save your money, your time, and your brain cells, and give this book a miss. The same goes, of course, for the rest of the dreadful series. I have to say \\"Shame on you, Random House\\".

0061122416|3.0|This book is interesting, well written, not a literary masterpiece, but enjoyable.<br /><br />The fact that it has been a huge success worldwide is because it is so easy to read<br />and appeals to a well known fact:  sometimes we look far and wide for answers that<br />are just within us. And yes, it is a quest for most human beings to find the right path.<br />Not an easy task.<br />For that it has merit.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I'm impressed. I downloaded this app and printed a test page and it worked. Just like that. I thought I'd have to mess around with selecting a printer but it just printed out. It even printed out nicely. There is a thing that says &quot;subscribe for more printing capabilities&quot;. I don't know what that's all about but for free, this is really fantastic.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My husband and I have greatly changed our lifestyle and lost weight after buying this Kindle book and audio CD version. It really changes the way we view modern wheat. Highly recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am not a big fan of bestsellers as a rule. My literary tastes tend away from the mainstream and off to the fringes of speculative fiction. I avoided the hype on this one for quite some time, but finally succumbed when people kept telling me I had to read it.  This book is a clear exception to the norm of bestseller lists.<br /><br />Many of you will recognize this as the old Spartacus / Gladiator story. Which is not a put-down in any sense -- she spun this old slave turned gladiator turned revolutionary trigger tale masterfully! The best tales can be told over and over again by great writers and be fresh and exciting in each telling.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has that rare combination of skills -- she is a really good writer and a great storyteller. I literally could not put this down once I started reading it. I read all three books in less than three days as I just had to find out what happened next. I thought the first book was the best of the three, but all of them were very, very good. I would say more, but if you haven't yet had the story spoiled for you (I hadn't), I won't ruin it for you.<br /><br />Personally, I thought the ending was just right -- it would have been thematically incongruous to wrap this up the way many people seem to have desired.<br /><br />I also don't get the complaints about the Kindle formatting. I read this Kindle edition (on a Fire) and had absolutely no issues. Yeah, there was a typo or two, but that's about it. If the formatting had sucked, I wouldn't have been able to finish the entire trilogy in less than three days. ;)<br /><br />I recommend this book highly -- very highly. You might want to keep a box of tissues nearby for some of it, though -- parts of it are absolutely heartbreaking.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is not as good as Gone Girl, Flynn's other novel, but it is still a very good read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love how you have 29 different translations to use in just one app!  I use this now for my devotions every day, because it is handy,  and have started taking it to Bible Study group as it gives the flexibility of cross referencing another translation!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was steered toward this book by a top books of 2012 list. It did not disappoint and kept me guessing!
1451627297|4.0|I'm not a big Stephen King fan, but I really liked this book and highly recommend it. It draws you in right away and doesn't let go until the end. It deals with time travel and what ifs. I'm sure many of us have wondered what the world would be like if JFK hadn't been killed. Also, what was the US like in the 50s and 60s? This book gives you a taste of that world and speculates on what would happen if one thing happened differently and utimately changed in history. The book uses time travel to explore this concept. You truly won't regret reading it.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I've been using this stylus for drawing on my iPad, and for it's price this thing is fantastic and a great value.  With it's thicker tip, it obviously isn't a great choice for super detailed work, but it is very responsive and comfortable to use for long periods of time.  I really like that it has a thicker body - I can't hold normal pens/pencils for a long time, but I've had a great experience drawing on my ipad with the Cosmonaut.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B003J27WFW|4.0|\\"Rush Beyond the Lighted Stage\\" is a very well made and entertaining documentary.  The interviews with the band's members are very well done and informative.  Being a Rush fan for close to three decades I was not disappointed.  I especially liked seeing such extensive interviews with drummer Neil Peart.  It was wonderful seeing the very private and anti-social man break his silence and open up to his legions of fans.  It was very nice to see him so relaxed in those interviews given the fact that he is very uncomfortable giving them.<br /><br />The producers of the documentary do a very good job with laying out the story of the band.  From their humble beginnings in Willowdale Canada to their first live performances with original drummer the late John Rutsey to their American debut.  The interviews with the band's management and producers add to the entertainment value of this documentary.  The interviews are very insightful and do a good job advancing the story.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed listening to how the band's musical style has evolved over the years.  What I especially enjoyed is how they stood up to their record company when they were told to make drastic changes in their style after the disappointing sales of \\"Caress of Steel\\".  That segment showed very well how much they band loves what they do and were determined to keep their style of music their own no matter what the cost.<br /><br />By far the best part of the documentary is the part that shows how Neil dealt with the horrible personal tragedies in his life in 1997 and 98.  The interviews with Neil were just amazing.  You can feel the emotion coming through the screen as he described his travels on his journey of healing.  What was also just as good was the interviews with Geddy and Alex as well as the band's manager.  The sadness they felt for their colleague and good friend is just as emotional.  What is especially commendable is that everybody respected Neil's wishes and allowed him to take asmuch time as he needed to recover from the tragedies (If he would ever completely recover is unlikely and that is perfectly understandable.) without any concern for Rush or music for that matter.  The segment ends perfectly with footage of the band's first live performance since Neil's return on the Vapor Trails tour.<br /><br />The documentary concludes with terrific footage of Rush together in a small resturant.  You can clearly see how true their friendship is and despite describing themselves as goofy and odd, they really are just three good guys who love each other and what they do.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that I think the documentary focused too much on interviews with other musicans and celebrities and their adulation for the band.  I understand the reason for having the interviews because it shows the impact Rush has had, but I think it was a little too much.  Especially Jack Black singing a few bars of \\"The Spirit of Radio.\\"  I could have done without that.<br /><br />However this is just a small flaw in an otherwise very well made documentary.  It is well worth seeing.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great for basic mathematical needs. simple usage without glitches or annoying advertisings. I generally use when grocery shopping or needing a quick tally on purchases.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed 75% of this book. After that it seemed like the author did not know what to do with the ending. In fact, there is no ending. There is absolutely no closure on any of the issues in the book. After such a good start I was terribly disappointed. One of the last lines of the book is \\"I don't have anything else to add.\\" My guess is that is what the author said so she just stopped writing. If this turns into a series then it makes sense but as a stand alone book it was a waste of time.
B006O7XOOW|5.0|I have five grandkids from 6 months to 10 years and this toy, like all of the air-powered Fish-Price toys, is a hit.  I actually have to keep more than one going at a time because the kids grab the balls and run or they knock them away as they are flying around.<br /><br />Our Playskool Explore and Grow Busy Ball Popper is nine years old and still working and the Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Poppity Pop Musical Dino is about a month old.  I haven't had any problems with these toys breaking and battery life has been splendid.<br /><br />The problem I do have is the balls get lost (or crammed in small holes) and they are expensive to replace ($20 for six here on Amazon).  I found a place online last year to order replacement balls from Playskool but you had to fax your order and they never responded to the fax.<br /><br />When I got this toy, I immediately searched their website for a way to order replacement balls and couldn't find one.  I emailed them and Fisher-Price replied with an email that sent me to their service page.  I followed the links to Stand-Up Ballcano and it states that no replacement parts are available.  But they do have replacement balls for Dino (search for \\"bag of balls\\") that I thought would work.  The balls cost $5 for six + $5 s&h + tax.  I ordered four packs so I ended up paying about $1 a ball.  Fisher Price sent a followup survey to see if I was satisfied and I explained the action I had taken.  I received a call today from Fisher Price stating that the balls I had ordered would NOT work with Ballcano and that the Ballcano balls were $11 for a bag of 6.  I told them that was too high so they sent me a bag for free and cancelled the earlier order.<br /><br />I had been told that Fisher Price had great service and now have evidence of such.  I did request, however, that they come up with a uniform ball size.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Great continuation from the first Tron, It never misses a beat with griping you and logging you into the Grid. Graphics are 10/10 and the Score/Soundtrack!!! 10 Plus!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Our book group selected Fifty Shades of Grey against our better judgment.  The book was so poorly written I found it almost impossible to finish.  There wasn't a single character in the book that I cared about and I found the main character to be rather unbelievable for a contemporary young woman who has just graduated from college.  If you're thinking of reading this book for the sex scenes, don't bother.  There are not remotely erotic.
B0000047CX|5.0|I bought this as an LP when it first came out.  The kid downstairs burned the house down and with it the album now, I can have it again but, in CD form.  If it was remastered to sound as good as the original, I will be in heaven!
1451627297|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan since I read THE STAND when I was in high school. I've read nearly all of his books, and I've hated a few, TOMMYKNOCKERS for one, I thought was complete drivel. So I'm not a slack-jawed, drooling, fawning, love-everything-thing King fangirl. Mostly. :-) There are a few more I didn't like. But this one? 11/22/63? I think it may be his best book, EVER. I won't detail the plot or give away spoilers, but this book just reinforces the vastness of King's imagination, and how he can take things--things that don't exist, like time travel--and extrapolate them out to their logical conclusions. As I was reading, I would shake my head and think, \\"Of course. That makes complete sense.\\"<br /><br />Also, he takes us back to a more innocent time in America--1958 - 1963, a time I remember from my childhood. It was great to re-visit that time. This book is brilliant. If you think you don't like King or horror (it's not horror), try this one, I think you'll love it. I certainly did. Mr. King, all I can say is, I'm so glad you recovered from that bad accident. The world would have missed out on so much. A hug to you, sir.<br /><br />One final thing:  I saw Bobby Kennedy in a parade in California the day before he was shot. I was 4-years-old, but it still resonates.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I wanted to read this trilogy so I would find out what all the fuss was about.  The plot was very predictable and the writing was mediocre.  The story could have been a very good one if the author had eliminated 75% of the sex and concentrated on the characters and storyline.
0439023483|2.0|I did like the story, great idea. But, the execution was poor. The book was grammatically correct and written to reflect professionalism between publisher and author, but the actual writing left a lot to be desired. I am an avid reader and writer myself and simply thought this book was bad. Sorry.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is one of the most fun games I've played in a long time on Android. It's extremely well made and has kept me entertained for several hours. Last time I checked my stats, I've put more than 15 hours into this game so far, and am close to level 60. This one's worth a bit of money. As little as I'd heard about it, I'm not sure if I'd have been willing to pay for it before I got a chance to play it myself, but I'd say this is worth at least a dollar, if not more, after having had a chance to try it out.
B000FDN8II|4.0|Moving Pictures by Rush is a wonderful album; it is a staple of most Prog Rock collections. Of course the vinyl is old so there were a couple of scratches on the record, but the quality and sound were otherwise good. The sleeve was a little worn (as to be expected) but wasn't falling apart like some records I come across.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I cannot say enough about \\"Rome\\".  If I plan to watch just a couple of programs a night, I find I'm up until the wee hours - it is hard to stop watching.  I'd highly recommend this DVD series.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|The movie is awesome....if you have a nice subwoofer I highly recommend cranking it up on this one.  But as so often with sequels they fall short...while this one doesn't fall as much short as many others sequels in this genre.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I use this app every day with my kindle fire. Some days I forget what I need to do so I c&agrave;n rely on this app.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am not really one to like mobile gaming that much, but this app has kind of changed my mind a bit. It is a game that is very easy to just pick up and play for short periods of time. It has a cool reward system for people that like achievements in games. I would recommend this game to anyone!
B007SGM084|5.0|I was skeptiable about these books in the beginning but my boss convinced me to read them and I absolutely loved them. It is a bit racey in the beginning but you get use to it.
B000002GJH|5.0|A must have CD! Great from start to finish. If you are a fan of 90s rock you won't be disappointed with this CD.
B001XUKFAQ|1.0|Ben Stiller has some talent...unfortunately his movies are always slow, boring, and unfunny. I was told by a bunch of people that this movie was great, so I went against my better judgment and rented it. After about an hour, we turned it off. I recognize the attempted satire and over-the-top intent of the movie, but the movie just isn't funny. It had potential but it just drags on and on and never really gets anywhere.<br /><br />There were a few funny scenes but it took forever to develop, and so much of this movie could have been cut out. I give major credit to Robert Downey Jr; he tries his best to save this movie from itself, but even he has trouble with it. The only other notable acting was Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise who did well playing their roles, but those roles were mediocre; and Brandon T. Jackson who played the actual black soldier had some good moments with RDJ.<br /><br />Overall, this is typical Ben Stiller. If you like his brand of comedy (outside of Something About Mary...his only real gem IMO), you might like it. But if you have been bored with other Ben Stiller movies like Zoolander...you will be bored with this one too.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Fast and friendly,shipping.Product was as advertised. Decent price. Movie was very good,played well on my machine,clear and crisp. Good quality sound. Very happy with purchase. In a nutshell, I got what I paid for. Would recommend this seller to others. Would use this seller again.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This is malware. I had to figure that out the hard way. I ended up having to format 10GB of music from my SD, factory data reset my phone, and reflash my R.O.M. and kernel. My phone would freeze and reboot anytime I tried to use an anti virus app.
0316776963|4.0|This is the second David Sedaris book I've read, after [[ASIN:0316777730 Naked]].  Like that book, this one is full of classic Sedaris stories - funny, touching, and always self-deprecating.  We follow Sedaris through all types of adventures - how does he get himself into these situations?  Overall, a great beach read for anyone looking for a light and fun read.<br />For Sedaris fans, I highly recommend Wade Rouse's [[ASIN:0307718719 It's All Relative: Two Families, Three Dogs, 34 Holidays, and 50 Boxes of Wine (A Memoir)]]. The similarities in their writing are many, as both are unabashedly gay humorists / memoirists.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|First, this film should've been rated NC-17.  There were some scenes that were just too over the top!!!  The film was excellent.  The story, the plots and sub-plots were all top notch. I didn't like the final scene in the film.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but its not what you would expect.  So expect the unexpected.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I had high hopes for this product, its compact size and rechargable battery were a plus. Too bad never got to find out. When it arrived, I charged it over night, and took it to work the next day. It worked great for about 10 min, then the output jack quit working. I jiggled the connection and it would work for a minute then stop, or it would only send signal to one speaker. I was willing to try it again but my only option was to return it. Bought a Boostaroo instead. Other guys at work use the boostaroo and are very happy with it.
0553277472|1.0|This is a rambling by some guy who conned a publisher into printing a book. It was written during a time when the boomers (I'm one of them) were looking for meaning. Having gotten out of the military about the time this book was published, I came home to a USA that was far different than when I left it. Drugs, anti establishment rhetoric,etc. I tried my best to assimilate. Having been a motorcyclist and having studied Buddhism while stationed in the Far East, I decided to read the book. I thought it sucked. The author appeared to me to be self absorbed with little regard for his son or anybody else. He rambled on about quality but couldn't seem to grasp what it was. I'll bet that trip was probably the first real adventure in his life.  I can't believe people spent money to go to college to have this guy teach them. He can be thankful for tenure. I believe this book was successful because it was published shortly after the cult film \\"Easy Rider\\" was released that made motorcycling popular.  BTW, I wonder how into many languages it's been translated. It's not an international best seller I'll bet. Bottom line, I would instead rather shorten my life by the amount of time it would take to read that book again, or far better yet, ride my motorcycle instead.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|Often I give a four star review for an otherwise great book that falls short in a particular area.  This book is so massive that I cannot put my mind around what fell short and what was great.  Sometimes I could not put it down.  Sometimes I fell asleep.  But it was a summer read, not a beach read, but a before bed or early morning read.  I read it on Kindle, which had some drawbacks.  I could not easily source the family trees, which in any case were too small to read.  I also wished there had been drawings depicting some of the topography.  Some of us are simply challenged that way!  In any case, this ambitious work succeeded in keeping my interest to the end.  The corruption of all the churches, Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian was an underlying theme which was a good reminder of the dangers of blurring the separation of church and state!  Also, the realization that there was never a generation that enjoyed complete peace and prosperity was good reminder of how we distort reality to meet our expectations, and that lasting peace and prosperity is, at least historically, a naive dream.  Do we really think we deserve (or will achieve) what all past generations have failed to?  Sobering, but reaffirming that our world is not so much changed, and that we need to look to history to remind us of the same lessons learned so many times before but that we simply refuse to remember.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and it works perfectly.  Have not had any issues with logging in, pinning new items, or repinning others posts.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I'm honestly shocked by the good reviews of this omnibus book. Its honestly one of the worst books I've read in years. The first couple 'novels' in the omnibus are painfully slow and more like short story format than a novel. The whole thing is painfully obvious once you get a short way into the series and simply not very believable. I guess if you like plodding, simplistic, post-apocalyptic stories this is for you. If you like complex and subtle novels I'd stay far away.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|FASCINATING! Dawkins is absolutely brilliant! I was absolutely enthralled from beginning to end. Between the wit and humor, as well as the personal touches, I felt as though I was sitting in a lecture hall listening to one of his lessons.<br /><br />I think EVERYONE, regardless of belief should read this book. No one, unless incredibly biased or just unable to grasp the concepts put forth, could walk away not believing in evolution (I was 100% sold after the first chapter). And if you want to walk away not believing in it, at least read it so you have the facts against that which you are arguing.<br /><br />Dawkins does an amazing job explaining everything in lay terms so that anyone could understand the concepts. There are also illustrations and pictures to help explain the more detailed concepts. This is the perfect book for anyone, even if you know nothing about biology and evolution. Not only does he do a great job explaining all of these concepts, he provides examples. Not just one or two, but many!<br /><br />I will definitely be buying the rest of his books and reading them :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm sure other reviews are more eloquent than this one, but I had to write after finishing Wool.  Absolutely amazing story, amazing writing, gripping all the way through.  A must read.  I'm so glad I gave this a go, and look forward to whatever comes next from Hugh Howey.  Can't recommend this book enough.  If you like Sci-Fi at all, you won't be disappointed.  Rarely do I come across a story this well told.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Bought this book to see what everyone was talking about, but couldn't read it. Got so far through and when the book changed from a budding romance into housewife porn I deleted it from my kindle. Some people say they love this book, others find it funny, I just found it disgusting.

B000FVQLRA|5.0|The Pianist (Roman Polański, 2002, 148')<br /><br />Having read and heard from my usual sources about it, this is the first time I have actually seen The Pianist. In a way, I have earlier avoided seeing it - as a long time historian, I know the history of World War II down to more details than I occasionally care to remember. I also know Poland, have been to Auschwitz in 1963. Not a nice topic, nor a subject you can hook off, nor forget easily.<br /><br />Polański's films I know from his first, Knife in the Water (1962), up to Chinatown (1974) without exception, and have seen them several times. Later, in Asia, I lost interest in movies in general - neither KL in the 1980's, nor Bangkok up to 2004, let alone Kunming of 1990-92 seemed to be the places, and, on top, Asian movie houses (at that time) smelled like New York cabs...<br /><br />The film, in a way, is Polański's history of his early youth in Cracow (his film is about the Warsaw ghetto, but parallels abound). He had not really addressed the subject in its entirety before - too painful, perhaps also too much risk to get it wrong, or generally, too much commercial interest in the otherwise serious holocaust topic?<br /><br />He took up shooting The Pianist in 2001, at the age of 68, with a budget of US$m35. All went right - the film must be one of, if not the best, on the persecution of the Jews in WWII, as told through a story, and historically as accurate as anything can ever get. Perfect craftsmanship at all levels, of the highest level. It can not be faulted.<br /><br />138us - The Pianist (Roman Polański, 2002, 148') - 27/8/2012
141694737X|5.0|Twins were given this book by their maternal grandparents amongst 25 others at birth . This was immediately chosen as a favourite by myself. Fast forward 22 months, book is still in circulation, flaps are now played with by twins. But book itself is still untorn, due to nice thick pages. So this is the book that evolves with child's development.

B00846REIS|3.0|I purchased this book because it was compared to 50 Shades. I gave it a 3 stars because I felt cheated. Did Sylvia Day copy and pasted some of the lines from 50 Shades. At one point I had to stop reading and make sure I was not reading 50 shades. The characters were cold and their was no build up, no raw emotions, no rollercoster.50 Shades was no well written. But Damn it! I love me some Anastasia and Christian. You felt the raw emotions of those two characters. Each page kept you wanting more and more. There was a real story behind all that kinky sex. Bared to You just didnt cut it for me. I tried really hard to get in to it and to love it. But it fell short for me. Sorry...

B0021L8UPS|5.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />After the death of a young child, a couple has been debating for a while whether to adopt another child to be a part of their family, they visit an orphanage and the wife Kate (Vera Farminga, \\"The Departed\\") sees a young girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman, \\"Hounddog\\"). Kate and her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard, \\"Green Lantern\\") learn that Esther is from Russia, her last adopted family was killed in a house fire and she barely survived. Initially Esther while timid blends in well with the family even taking to playing with Kate and Peter's daughter Max (Aryana Engineer, in her debut role) who is deaf but quite smart. Their son however seems to think Esther is weird, which does come into play later in the film.<br /><br />What follows is a slow reveal of Esther being perhaps just a little more than a normal little girl, as she pushes a girl off a slide who made fun of her at school, then she kills an badly injured bird right in front of the son and Max. This does sound like a pretty basic story of a disturbed orphaned kid, but the story by Alex Mace, David Leslie Johnson's screenplay and Jaume Collet-Serra's directing do lend some very good dark tones to this and they keep the chills and terror coming, even if the viewer can figure out whats gonna happen long before it does.<br /><br />\\"Orphan\\" is actually a very well done movie, it has a feeling of dread everytime Esther is on screen as you're just waiting for something to happen, there's also the underlying storyline of troubles between Kate and John from things that happened in their recent past. The daughter's deafness does come into play during key parts of the movie and while most everyone does well in their roles Isabelle really breaks out as Esther as its easily one of the most layered characters from the thriller/horror genre in recent memory.<br /><br />Its better to be watched and enjoyed, course if you've read other reviews you know the twist already which I did catch before it was totally revealed however the revelation in the movie was well done and seeing the terror on Vera's face was pretty tense and cool to see. **** out of 4 stars.e it was totally revealed however the revelation in the movie was well done and seeing the terror on Vera's face was pretty tense and cool to see. **** out of 4 stars.
0345803485|1.0|Downloaded on to a kindle for my wife. I tried to speed read through this to see what all the fuss was about but gave up after a third of the way through. I know that this is utter rubbish. Cannot under any circumstance say anything positive about this drivel.
1609611543|3.0|Well written and researched, this book is an interesting read; very little new information from my viewpoint but fascinating for a layperson.  That said, the recommendations for recipies et al are simply horrible, and the Tofu Mousse is one of the most disgusting things I've tasted!  So, buyer beware: this is a very educational book but it leaves the solutions side of things...well, let's just say it left a bad taste in my mouth. :-)

0307730697|5.0|This was perhaps one of the most beautiful stories, relating to the military and our current military situation, that I have read in a long time.  I felt truly honored to be even allowed to read this book and have an inside look at the life of a man, and his family, who we are lucky to have had tred this ground for the years we did.  Eric Blehm clearly took the time and was 100% dedicated to the story of Adam Brown and to honoring him, his family, and his SEAL family.  After reading the book I discovered that many of the men interviewed for it were lost to us in a Marine Helicopter crash.  That made reading the story even more haunting.  I'm writing this review just as it is hitting the media that another SEAL book will be making appearance on bookshelves in a couple weeks.  If you are interested in a SEAL book, and what to learn about being a SEAL, the life of one and his family then I would suggest picking up FEARLESS.  You can read the first chapter here.  There's also a wonderful podcast with Eric Blehm here, if that sort of thing interests you.

We have made several of their recipes and each one has turned how better than we expected.  We have also tried making a custard base that you cook from other sources but have found B&J's base is awesome for us using a Cuisinart 2 qt ice cream maker. The sweet cream  base has a really good flavor.  Two fun guys that shared their secrets so we could all enjoy the great Ben & Jerry's taste in a fun and simple homemade kinda way! Thanks!
0345803485|4.0|As with some of the others, I thought this book was just ehh.. okay. I am extremely uncomfortable talking or reading about sex. And if you are, don't read it. It has foul language throughout the book. But I'm not sure if you can have an explicit sexual relationship like these 2 and not use foul language.<br /><br />However, I fall in love with the love story. I fall in love with the idea of Christian. I am pulling for Ana and him to make love (and I mean make love- not crazy BDSM or whatever it's called) and fall in love and have trillions of babies! (Ok-maybe not trillions-but you get the idea.)<br /><br />I will keep reading the trilogy in hopes of them falling in love.<br /><br />Laters ;)
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Although I liked the song Video Games on the radio, her performance on SNL had slowed me down in purchasing her album.  So glad I finally caved.  Her voice is so varied in each song and I LOVE it.  Most of her songs feel like a story, her voice a different point of view.  Her lyrics are fun, gritty, and make me pray to God my daughter will never relate to her music. :D  Can't wait to hear whatever she creates next.
1419702203|3.0|I felt the \\"movie\\" was fairly balanced look at Harrsion's life and spiritual beliefs - I know it has time limitations, but it is interesting that it generally omitted several 'key' elements:<br /><br />1. the publishing of the only Beatle autobiography (I Me Mine) and its effect on the Harrsion-Lennon relationship.<br />2. Patty Harrsion got little play  -  althought the Eric Clapton interviews about 'them' were great<br />3. Also noteworthy - the movie really down played the work George did with Badfinger, Ringo Starr and other artists after the Beatles (except for the Ravi Shankar parts)<br /><br />I would have appreciated more of what a giant work the Concert for Bangledesh was. Also nice interview material with Paul, Ringo, Eric Clapton.  Shame they could't find more John footage to balance it out.<br /><br />Over all a MUST for Harrison fans and very interesting for Beatle fans.

B0086700CM|4.0|This app works great on the kindle fire!  It's tons of fun, and very addictive.  A great game to play when you're bored.  I would rate this five stars, but just recently the game became kind of choppy.  It's still playable, though, and functions just like before.  It just kind of annoys my eyes when it's choppy.  But overall, this is an awesome app, and you should totally get it.  PLUS...it's free!
B0045HCJQW|5.0|It is simply amazing to me, in watching The Philadelphia Story, that Katharine Hepburn went into this movie being a \\"not wanted\\" actress by studios. They felt she wasn't worth casting. I think of her as an absolutely brilliant actress, and this movie shows why. She holds her own against powerhouses such as Cary Grant and James Stewart and has us, until the very end, wondering which suitor she will choose.<br /><br />The dialogue is amazingly fun. Even after multiple rewatchings I am still laughing out loud and smiling at the situations. There are hidden identities, crossed purposes, and all the usual shenanigans, but it's handled with such a deft hand here. The writing is spectacular, and the execution by the actors is brilliant.<br /><br />Yes, we have the poor vs rich, the full-of-choices vs the stuck-with-what-I-have, but there's so much more here. The craving to be accepted and appreciated. The desire to follow one's heart. The many twists and turns that all of our lives take.<br /><br />And where the vast majority of movies - even today! - often don't even have two female characters who speak to each other about anything meaningful, The Philadephia story back in 1940 featured wonderfully strong, smart women who could hold their own against the men in the room. Some of the best dialogue is between women. It's such a treat to have an equal playing field.<br /><br />If I have any complaints at all, it's about something which might be seen as an \\"era related issue\\". Katharine's father is off having an affair with a dancer, and it's this affair that is causing a lot of the grief and problem in the movie. And yet when the father waltzes in, he blames KATHARINE for causing him to have the affair! His daughter! What??? Somehow it's because she wasn't approving and loving and adoring enough of him that he was FORCED to go off and sleep with other women to get the love he needed. This upsets me greatly. And she bought into it! She said \\"Oh sorry Daddy, it's all my fault that you had to go sleep around\\".<br /><br />If people really thought this way in 1940, I am EXTREMELY glad that is in our past.<br /><br />But with that minor quibble, I enjoy this movie immensely and highly recommend it.that you had to go sleep around\\".<br /><br />If people really thought this way in 1940, I am EXTREMELY glad that is in our past.<br /><br />But with that minor quibble, I enjoy this movie immensely and highly recommend it.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|Rose Gardner spent the first twenty four years of her life being controlled by her mother and as a result had very limited life experiences. When her mother was murdered and she had visions of her own death, she listed 28 items on the back of a Walmart receipt, things that she wished to accomplish before her death. It was enjoyable to see how Rose transformed from an invisible young woman to someone who stood up for herself. Moreover, the budding romance between Rose and Joe, her next door neighbor was sweet as well as realistic when they bickered with each other.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Scarily believable especially after reading book 6 which is the prequel. Looked forward every day to reading more. Wouldnt have put it down if it werent for that pesky job thing.
B000058BGV|4.0|but flawed and blessed differently.  Richter is lighter and more energetic in this performance than<br />in his 1980 remake. The orchestra is superb in both, but the chorus here sounds more<br />transparent and slightly more attractive here. Haefliger was the best Evangelist of his<br />generation. He recorded it also with Van Beinum in 1958 and Jochum in 1965.  Fischer-Dieskau was amore agile and brighter here, though he avoided annoying huffery puffery<br />in both versions. Keith Engen, Antonia Fahberg and Max Proebstl all sing attractively.<br />I confess to finding Irmgard Seefried's relatively thick timbre unattractive even here<br />when she was still fine interpretively and vocally.  She is much better here than in<br />Jochum's otherwise great 1963 Cosi (DG/BPO). Undoubtedly a minority view, but Fahberg<br />would have sung this role better, not to mention Stader and Streich. And I find Hertha Topper a liability.<br />The female soloists in 1980 (Edith Mathis and Janet Baker ) are preferable, I think.  Peter Schreier is a fine Evangelist and Matti Salminen excellent in the Bass roles in 1980.<br /> Peers: Jochum/RCOA/Philips; Solti/CSO/Decca; Gonnenwein/EMI (great cast)
B007STBUIW|5.0|One of the most influential movies of all time is finally on Blu-Ray and the results are staggering. The timeless film has been restored from the original prints for perfect picture and sound under the supervision of director Steven Spielberg. Presented in 1080pi HD and a brand new 7.1 audio, the film has never looked or sounded as good as this. Comes with a great selection of extras including The Making of Jaws, and the highly anticipated The Shark Is Still Working. 5-Star treatment to a 5-Star Classic! Highly recommended!
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|The action sequences are spectacular and realistic.  I've read numerous SEAL books and am happy with the way the tactics are applied in this movie.  It's a little tough to watch the guys try an act though; at times they are very flat and lifeless.  The opening scene really sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and the audience gets a look at the way Naval Special Warfare teams operate and work together to accomplish a mission.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|In disbelief that anything could be as bad as the first entry in this series, I gave the second one a look. The casting of Eric Porter in the Brett series was a stroke of inspiration seldom encountered in television or anywhere else. That mountain of crags WAS Moriarty. He has been replaced here by a bearded cherub. But then this is the type of film that cannot be photographed with too much sharpness lest it be taken for a commercial film when heaven knows the director is making an A.R.T. film, the kind they drain of color except for flesh tones. I earnestly hope that they get the lead actor they wanted all along for the following films: Jackie Chan! He would fit right in. Meanwhile, I will be walking through a cow pasture to get away from crackpots and bloated movies like this.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Charming coming of age story that leads the reader into the world of a troubled teen struggling with sexuality, depression, and teen life in general.  An amazing story that any teen or older individual should read!  Would recommend to anyone.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Very bugg app for android (specifically gs3) - the ads flash over the entire screen repeatedly then takes me back to the opening scene, making me have to find where I left off. Does this after each and every level passed; severely detracts from enjoying the game. So my advice? Don't bother with this free version, if you don't want frustration to take over instead of relaxed enjoyment.<br /><br />Ended up purchasing the ad-free version. So much better because bugginess is gone. Worth paying for, this game is a lot of fun. Different than the regular Angry Birds because you have to figure in gravity and all that outer-space stuff.
B004N55YD6|5.0|As though an album of this caliber needs *another* positive review.<br /><br />The first album I purchased in-store, from the \\"$5 shelf\\" at the local Drug Emporium. Bought it the morning of Christmas 2000. Twelve years later and I still play it regularly. Every song is worth hearing (many times over).
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I was hooked to this book. I stared reading it and then I couldn't put it down. I am excited to see the other side of the story from Travis's perspective. I did hate how Abby just couldn't decide and it seemed to drag out forever. However, I still couldn't put the book down even though at times I wanted to slap abby through the pages.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have this app on my ipad and when it came out for Android I bought it right away for my kindle fire! This app is one of the best if you say it is bad you are crazy!
1577314808|1.0|When you need to get up in the morning, to go for your run so you wouldnt look ugly disgusting fatty, you can instead, ignore your mind and its thoughts of needing to get up and instead, to concentrate on THE POWER OF NOW, the cozy warm bed and screw the thoughts which tell you if you dont get up now, your future will be messed up and you will be fat and ugly. But no concentrate on THE POWER OF NOW, the warm cozy bed... the feeling in your body....screw the past which led you to your miserable present, dont worry about it, you have nothing to learn from it, screw the future who cares you will be fat, just stay in bed because its all about the present, about THE POWER OF NOW<br /><br />After I read it, I was left confused and unhelped, feeling wasted my time and depressed.. I saw the author speak live on DVD, and he was weak in emotions, nervous and self-indulgent... totally incongruent
B004ZN9YNC|1.0|This has to be the most depressing Pink Floyd album or more appropriately, Roger Waters album I have ever heard. I remember listening to this when I was 14 and feeling so sad. This album is really just a continuation of the The Wall. I thought it was normal Pink Floyd having been exposed to The Wall first when I was a kid. Then, I heard what made Pink Floyd famous...Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, Meddle.<br /><br />The music in the Final Cut is soulless. I don't know, there is nothing there that makes you want to come back to listen to it again. It's just so bland and blahh. My first thought when I listened to this was that this album would serve better those who are trying to commit suicide because this music will definitely put you \\"in the mood\\" to slit your wrists.<br /><br />5 stars if you love being depressed otherwise this is a 1 for all other normal people.
B003LSU0K8|4.0|I really like my watch! Altitude sensor varies on quite a few conditions, such as temperature and so. Being new in this area of barometer, altimeter, etc on watches, I had expected to have a more consistent reading, but if your life is not depending on the altitude reading, I would say it does a very fair job. I would recommend this watch to my friends!
B0082SU98U|5.0|Pollyanna is a wonderful book for kids or adults almost any age above 8 years old. It is very interesting and I enjoyed it very much. I had to do a book report on this and it was easy because there were so many details to write about. I would recommend this book to anybody at any time. The only bad part about it, was that it was kind of slow in the first few chapters. Another good thing about it on kindle, is that it's free! It is also a very good story in general. The author did a very good job with this book and she should be proud. The story of Pollyanna's life is fascinating! Young readers like myself enjoy this very much if you are an avid reader. I am only in 6th grade and I love it. At first I was very bored, but then it got very good and I couldn't stop reading it. I read the last twelve chapters in one day it was so good! Kindle also makes it even more fun. I also recommend the Kindle Fire. It's got alot of wonderful features and games. Very useful and more fun than hard back books. Pollyanna is one of my most favorite books of all time and I hope y'all will enjoy it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game can keep you busy and has really God replay value! highly recommended for anyone who likes spatial reasoning games... or at least more educational than just killing zombies.... :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I live in Florida so now we are getting hit by Hurricane Isaac so its great to use when we r not at home. It gives you warnings and watches,  tells you the whole day weather wise, it even gives you advice on what activities you should not be doing or could be doing. There are videos that are updated every hour and it send notifications! You can check the weather from all over the world You can customize it and more. Its very useful.
0439023483|5.0|It is definitely a page turner and will keep you interested from one chapter to the next until you finish the book. It is well written and very emotional with a great heroine as the leading character. I highly recommend this book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this app works better then my actually clock.  I am very impress by the quality of this app.  just wish I had of found it sooner.
0345803485|1.0|This triology was recommended to me as I was looking for a new series to read. I felt this book was poorly written and really did not keep me engaged at all. I will not be reading the last two of the series.
B007HJA5IO|5.0|The generation that was raised on fantasy books grew up and are creating their own books and movies!  Now they make adult versions and Game of Thrones is an excellent production of this genre.<br />Got to watch it on HBO and wanted to add it to my library.  Can't wait for season two to come out on amazon.
0439023491|5.0|I usually start reading a book and never finish it, but with this book was unbelievable! I finished it in just a couple of days! Fantastic!

6305718954|4.0|I've recently asked people from the Religion and Christianity Forum here on Amazon what were their views on horror movies. I've always been curious to know what they think about demons, angels and demonic possessions and the way they are depicted in horror movies. At first, i thought that stupidity, non-sense  and heresy would be the main comments i would get in regards to horror but i was far from the truth. A few people indeed admitted that horror was nothing more than non-sense for them but a majority of them actually liked the genre and the movies for what it is. We had an interesting discussion about it and i was surprised to see that yes, some of those movies were indeed able to bring a little message of faith across  people who never really had a opinion on it, but mostly, those movies were also seen and praised for entertainment purposes, basically just to have a good time, like everybody else. STIGMATA was one of those movies, it was raw, scary, entertaining and at the same time carrying a very strong message of faith..<br /><br />Stigmata was not a big Hollywood production movie, i never consider it like that, it was simple and straight to the point. No big Hollywood stars, no crazy special effect, just a good story with punch. I would consider it as \\"Religious Horror\\", so as any movies involving demonic possessions and exorcisms.  It is the story of Frankie Paige, a young atheist who seemed to have received what is consider as \\"Stigmata\\", marks and sores corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ. Father Andrew Kiernan will help Frankie figure this out and find out why these things are happening to her. It appears Frankie might be holding the key to what would appear to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus Christ (The Gospel of Thomas). Father Kiernan will have to get to the bottom of this, eluding a conspiracy to keep this gospel from coming out.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it to any religious horror fans. A good movie with a strong message! And remember, Jesus said... the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood... and I am there, lift a stone... and you will find me.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!essage! And remember, Jesus said... the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone.

B006BDHAX0|4.0|lots of fun some are very challenging love the reset feature would enjoy more boards have replayed all several times
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I can see why some may consider this book to be a jab at capitalism. It definitely doesn't hold back when it comes to demonizing banks and business. If you can set that aside (which I think most people can), this novel is truly one of the greatest American tales of all time. It would take a cold-heart person to not be moved by the story of the Joad family. My favorite Steinbeck was always Of Mice and Men, but THe Grapes of Wrath easily took its place the from the second I finished it. You must read this amazingly well-written novel.
0439023513|5.0|*******Spoiler Alert*******<br /><br />It is amazing the number of mixed and negative reviews people have written for this book.  I think, like others, that they seemed to have missed the point.<br /><br />I know that people are disappointed about how the book ends.  How after we have invested so much in Katniss we don't get the \\"happily ever after\\" that we wanted.<br /><br />Well, guess what people?  That's life.<br /><br />Some have criticized the book for it's lack of character development.  Remember this story is told first person.  We are looking at these events through Katniss' eyes.  At the beginning of the book, Katniss is in a strange land occupied by strangers.  The character development is that which Katniss herself experiences.  To her many of these people are but faces in the crowd.  She barely has time to register their existence.  Her life in the third book is a whirlwind of war, death, and terror.<br /><br />The events in Mockingjay are just one huge Hunger Games.  But on a much larger scale.  The Hunger Games were always a microcosm of war.  And as Katniss learns the hard way, war is much more brutal than the Games ever were.<br /><br />In this book we begin to see the incredible psychological toll this experience has taken on Katniss, Peeta, Gale and others.<br /><br />Sure, we would be happy if there was a true \\"happily ever after\\", but what transpires in the book is much more realistic.  Katniss is treated no differently than we treat our own war heroes.  They may or may not come back to fanfare and praise, but are many times quickly discarded and ignored like we have done with nearly all of our vets after WWII.  Their usefulness has expired.  Katniss can't be killed for her crimes, she was too much a voice of the revolution.  However, as a symbol of that revolt, her usefulness is done.  So they do like we all do.  They forget her.<br /><br />Heymitch continues to block out his life with Alcohol.  He too, as the mentor, no longer has a purpose inthis new world, so he reverts back to blotting out the horrors of the past with drink.<br /><br />Peeta, has never fully recovered from his torture in the capital and deals with his own horrors in his own way.<br /><br />So the story ends, as it ends for many of our war veterans.  They are people, who are trying as they might, to deal with the horrors of their past.  Their innocence and idealism has been stripped away by the cruel realities of war and death.<br /><br />So while we wail and gnash our teeth in what should have been or could of been, Katniss finds comfort in the small things, a simple life, raising her children.  After all.  As she so eloquently says at the end of the book:<br /><br />  \\"There are much worse games to play\\"
B001I0T92Q|4.0|This took awhile to get to me as it was air mailed, but I didn't have to pay much shipping for it. Granted, it is incredibly light. This is more rare than your average SD adapter and was only available this way. I was thrilled when I got it though, because it allows me to put in up to 128 gigs of memory on one Pro Duo... I mean, that is what I could do maximum, not what I used it for, since the 64gb SDs are very expensive. However, you can get genuine sandisk SD cards if you shop around at 32gb for under 20 dollars with shipping. Two of those is less than 40, and with this adapter, you have 64 gigs at your disposal in a pro duo, excellent for taking extensive video or for your PSP.<br /><br />IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:<br /><br />*It can only be formatted and used in a device (Do not format or transfer data to it with computer's card reader).<br />ONE SOLUTION: Use your PSP and USB cord as your memory stick reader/connection rather than popping the card and putting it in a \\"drive\\" type reader.<br /><br />*It is essentially a RAID device, so once you stick two cards in, they aren't hot-swappable (you'll have to reformat to use it after changing out a card).<br /><br />*The micro SDs will have to be reformatted before use in another device (again, because it's a RAID).<br />Same as above, if you want to backup certain things then reformat, you can do so by using your PSP usb cable.

B005LAIHHC|3.0|I remember seeing this guys other films. Only Borat seemed to be the best one he made. The others are so so, just like this film. I found myself smiling and laughing at some parts, but the whole film wasn't worth more than 3 stars. I think this movie was so tamed down from his previous movies, he made. I remember him doing way more outrageous stuff before this one and now it just seems like the usual stuff but less. This is watch for sure, but not a buy.
B004R1Q296|2.0|I love medieval fiction, i.e. Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series and Follett's amazing The 'Pillars of the Earth' and 'World Without End'.  Not Tuckman's fault that it is actually a historical narrative, but boy, is it boring!  Mired in detail about French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy it was way too dry for me.  If you're a history buff, go for it.  But if you're looking for entertaining reading, keep looking.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great to get an insight into the live, thinking, struggles and ideals of this man. Very well written, never boring.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book after reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and I thought it was a great follow up book. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this series. So much so, I have asked my husband for a digital e-reader for Christmas just so I can have it withut the hassle of oing to the bookstore.
B007XNAOS0|4.0|My son and I have been complaining about the lack of growth in Indie/Rock music for<br />some time now. The Yellow and Green cd is a good alternative to the overplayed indie market.<br />  Yellow is listening to solid vocals with a slightly reserved but good metal background, it<br />is a nice change and Green is something to study by.
0345803485|2.0|Ok, this is not really what anyone could consider great literature. The writing is repetitive. Seriously, there are actual word and phrase counts in some reviews. As I did not have a kindle when I read this, you won't find those counts here. So, if repetition annoys you, you probably should just let the hub-bub die down and forget it (or get it from your library, but you have been warned). The writing is repetitive.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Just in case anyone missed it, there may be spoilers ahead.<br /><br />The story is also circular, which is frustrating and just another way of being repetitive. Ana is constantly worried about certain sexual acts, yet she keeps on drifting through what passes for a relationship in this novel. I really don't know how many times Ana thinks it, but \\"it always comes back to this\\" is featured quite a few times. It made me roll my eyes so many times because before getting halfway through the book, you know it's an issue, she knows it's an issue, Grey knows it's an issue, and yet they dance around it constantly.<br /><br />The characters keep talking about how smart Ana is, but really she's an idiot by what we're shown. Or at the very least uncomfortably naive. Uncomfortable because if she's old enough and mature enough to have sex, she should be old/mature enough to discuss things or be able to call her vagina something other than \\"down there.\\" Seriously. It gets really grating.<br /><br />And yet, I read it to the end and wanted to know what happened. I'm not sure yet if it was because I cared about the characters or it was more of a morbid fascination. Regardless, I read the trilogy.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I was surprised when I started this book, I couldn't put it down. Got on to amazon and bought  the other 2books. Great read.
B00406TRU4|5.0|Merlin is a great show.  It is fun and can be suspensfull.  Acting and scenery take you back in time and place.  A different perspective of the King Author tale.  I recommend this to anyone for fun entertainment.  Very appropriate for members younger age group and also enjoyable if you are not.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I don't normally break down albums by track, but I think it's useful for this album:<br />1: Obligatory intro track. Meh.<br /><br />2 thru 5: What you expect from ITM. Maria singing and screaming, heavy guitars and drums, good stuff in general. There's a touch of electronic sound here, which adds depth without being too much. Songs are darker than usual for ITM, with a lot of lyrics focused on sex and lust. I like how it's all still recognizable as ITM but not just a rehash of what they've done previously. Not sure it's as excellent as their best from other albums, though - if nothing they seem a bit repetitive at times, like they could use one more verse or solo and one less repeat of the refrain. Still very good, though.<br /><br />6: Filler. But also kind of a transition, and with Maria whispering dirty things, so it's not a total loss.<br /><br />7, 8: Slower, less heavy and more atmospheric. Not what you'd expect, but AMAZING. 'Scarlet' is easily my surprise hit of the album. Okay, it's not very metal, but it's worth the listening.<br /><br />9: More filler? Okay, ITM, you're starting to try my patience.<br /><br />10: More upbeat, not as heavy as 2-5, but good.<br /><br />11: Similar to 7 and 8, and also very good.<br /><br />12-14: Nothing here worked for me. 12 is heavy but doesn't feel complete, like it's half a finished song that they padded to fill the album. 13 and 14 are obligatory slow songs. That's not a bad thing, a lot of bands do them and ITM's are usually very good, but these are too slow, don't build to much of a payoff, and 14 almost puts you to sleep. Not a good way to go out.<br /><br />So, yeah, worth 4/5 from me. When it's good it's very good, better than a lot of what's out there and as good as anything ITM's done before. But there's a lot of filler and a lot that doesn't work. If you like ITM or metal in general, give it a try. You probably won't like every moment from end to end, but there's at least a few songs in here that everyone canlove.
0471702188|5.0|This book does a great job of helping readers understand the drivers of corporate value: ROIC and growth rates, not revenue growth or market share dominance. Easy to read and has great examples as well.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I truly enjoy using this app, however I feel it is lacking in one major area: the ability to zoom in on certain products that you are viewing. Often, when browsing through clothes or other items I'd appreciate a closer look, but that option is not available. That is my main gripe with this app. If that feature were added, I'd give it 5 stars.
1416550550|4.0|It took awhile to get used to the constant chapter shifts back and forth in time, tracking the lives of three women throughout a span of over 100 years. Once I got into the habit of checking the date at the top of each chapter and knew which woman would be the subject, it was easier to follow. The fairy tales sprinkled along the way were very engaging and reminiscent of my own childhood. The writing was beautiful and every chapter developed a tantalizing piece of a most compelling mystery. However, the ending fell a bit flat and the overall tone of the novel was joyless and somber.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Really fun...good brain teaser..makes u think.<br />Would recommend to anyone.<br />Good pricing.<br />Where is Perry is okay for children to play as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was a very solid book. I've read so much sci-fi by now that few things really impress me but somehow Wool managed to. It reminds me very much of Fallout the game. Keen to see the authors other stuff!<br /><br />Darryl
B0068FZ024|5.0|First off love the film, and have it on Region 1 DVD.<br /><br />Was going to buy this Universal 100th Anniversary version, but just noticed Amazon has no details on any Extras / Special Features on this disc? Checked with a few of the other 100th Anniversary selection, and this seems to be the case with a lot of them (Apollo 13, Sixteen Candles and Inglourious Basterds for example).<br /><br />Can you update this Amazon? As a lot of people buy Bluray's / DVDs for extras as much as they buy them for the movie itself.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Simon
B008D28HYS|3.0|I really like this game. I just wish there was a hint button. Or a title for each level so I would have an idea what the picture looks like. Also, if you get stuck, you can't move on.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I loved this book, especially the descriptions of the Sierras and the hiking.  It made me want to hike the whole Pacific Crest Trail!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Ambitious attorney Martin Vail (Richard Gere) volunteers his services to a vagrant charged with the murder of a Chicago archbishop. Vail is covered in blood and was captured nearby minutes after the crime. Vail becomes convinced that his client didn't do it, then 'realizes' multiple personalities are involved, and the client's other personality did it. Eventually, the client is sent off for psychological evaluation and a likely limited sentence. Much better than the death penalty.<br /><br />Except that at the end, Vail realizes he's been conned and he's gotten a guilty man off. (Reality - I doubt it. He would have ensured that the state-evaluation would have reached the proper analysis, and at least jailed the killer for life.)
0307592731|2.0|I purchased this book due to having a passion for backpacking and hiking.  As I read through this book I started to have doubts that she ever went on this trail.  Cheryl portrays herself as a dysfunctional person with the lack of common sense and morals.  The self destructive behavior she exhibited through the book is one reason I question the authenticity of it.  Another reason is the lack of preparedness and conditioning for the trail.  The amount of weight she describes the pack had would have fatigued her and she would have quit.  With the content of the book it truely amazes me that the PCT would advertise it on their website. You are better off reading this book as a piece of fiction rather than non-fiction.
B007SGM084|3.0|I am reviewing only the first volume here.  I can see why this is a popular book and why it appeals so strongly to women in its purience.<br /><br />However, I found Ms. James' overuse of \\"inner goddess\\" and the the verb \\"clambered\\", (among other conventions), so distracting that the book left me more irritated than entertained.  Did she not have an editor? Does she own a thesaurus?  If it weren't for the adult subject matter, it would be easy to believe  this book was written by an eighth-grader. (Perhaps its popularity is due partly to reading levels of the average American these days.)  I won't be reading the other two books.  I prefer to spend my time reading authors who've honed their skills.  Meanwhile, Ms. James will be smiling all the way to the bank, no doubt!
B007Y5IAV0|5.0|I really like SYSTEM OF A DOWN, but Serj Tankian is really creating some great stuff solo!!!!! ELECT THE DEAD is a great album, IMPERFECT HARMONIES is weird but grows on you....HARAKIRI, Serj´s 3rd strike is a mix of both....There´s HEAVY guitars and fast drums on songs like CORNUCOPIA, WEAVE ON, FIGURE IT OUT, OCCUPIED TEARS and UNEDUCATED DEMOCRACY, but also some strange techno tunes like DEAFENING SILENCE and FORGET ME KNOT....Mr. TANKIAN is a great artist, with inspired lyrics, and if you like SYSTEM or ELECT THE DEAD, HARAKIRI may please you....REALLY GREAT!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|In a time when writing ability does not matter, this book reaches a new low.  It reads as if someone invented a software program that chooses the most shallow, predictable, formulaic plot advanccements that will result in a huge movie deal.  I would not be surprised if we learn the movie script was written first, then the book series was written as a promotion.  Or that the producers of _Twilight_, the other brain-cell-destroying teen film scam, were involved.<br /><br />If you want a great read, try Sinbad's adventures, or Kidnapped, or Treasure Island, or a really great adventure novel - 1001 Arabian Nights.  Just please, for the love of God, don't make yourself a little less intelligent by reading this horrible excuse for a real book.
B007STBUIW|1.0|The BluRay claims to come with a digital copy for iTunes. It only has an UltraViolet code. There is no iTunes code. Lame.
0345803485|1.0|This was one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  The characters were one-dimensional, the dialog sounded like it had been written by a 12 year old, the concept was ridiculous, the plot development was non-existent.  Sure, there were some titillating bits, but the price you had to pay for them (reading through the tripe leading up to it) wasn't worth it.  Bleah.  I'm sorry I bought this.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|must get app perfect for your kindle.always being able to tell your battery level and very easy to use get now!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Quite addicting; however I would like a easier way to get invest points.  But other than that I have fun especially when I need to burn some time waiting at the doctors and such.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has good flow.  It is rewarding and challenging, balanced, never frustrating or boring.  The interface is intuitive.  I enjoy the larger puzzles, and my kindergardener enjoys the smallest puzzles.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It isn't bad. Wins are not impossible like Windows solitaire.  The ads are very annoying, but hey, it's free.  Overall, it is a decent solitaire game.

6305428522|5.0|Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.  In 1957, a weekly quiz show, 'Twenty-One', often referred to as 'The Sixty-four Thousand Dollar Question', was the indisputable number-one show on television.<br />People everywhere would stop whatever they were doing to witness America's best and brightest answer difficult  questions about anything and everything in an effort to win more money in a half-hour than most of the viewers could earn in a decade.<br />These fanatically loyal fans are destined to be shocked and nearly traumatized when a Congressional investigation uncovers an ongoing hoax created and sustained by the network executives to rig the show in order to ensure that only the most physically attractive, charismatic contestants consistently win, thereby guaranteeing continued record-high ratings.<br />Older folks like me will thoroughly enjoy re-living a time when black-and-white pictures, rabbit ears, and viewing television through appliance store windows were the norm.  The younger generation will thoroughly enjoy, and probably die laughing at how little was required back in those ancient times to keep the populace content and entertained.

B000003N7F|1.0|I was very excited to receive \\"A Love Supreme\\".  It was shipped fast and the packaging looked good.  I immediately opened it up and go to play it but alas the record was snapped in half.  Heartbreaking!  Now I have to ship it back because this order from the shipper - NorAm International Partners doesn't have a replace item for this product.  BOOOOOOO!!!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have always had trouble falling asleep. I've tried using white noise to fall asleep before, but nothing worked. I now use this app to fall asleep quickly every night. Best 2.99 I ever spent!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it! its fun and addictive! I don't know why but I have to force myself off so I can get my stuff done.
1607053888|4.0|The best thing about this book is that the instructions are clear with good pictures to match. The writer expects you to have some basic sewing knowledge but you can start with some of the simpler items even if you don't.  There is a good variety of bags as well.
B003QP4BJM|4.0|The book seems redundant in the begining with the repeated message that specialization and trade is what brought prosperity to civilizations of the past. It then gets more interesting when it moved into modern times.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was right at this point when I left my kindle on the plane and am waiting to hear back from the airline to be reunited with this interesting read.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  I have not read the book (generally I prefer to see the movie before reading the book--it almost ALWAYS disappoints if reversed)so approached it solely as a movie.  It does not seem to stand on it's own.  While Jennifer Lawrence was compelling to watch, and Stanley Tucci did his usual excellent job, I felt there was something lacking.  The movie dragged in parts (on the train, for example) and moved too quickly in others ( the actual game.) There was not enough character development--I couldn't really bring myself to invest in what happened to these people.  For example, I didn't get why Katniss cared about Rue so much.  She made very brief appearances before their big scene.<br /><br />Overall OK--but doesn't motivate me to want to read the book.  It's certainly no \\"Harry Potter.\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started a little slow but once the momentum starts the twists and turns keep coming. Very good book, easy read. I now understand why this was on the best seller list for summer reads.
B0085Z3AMW|5.0|This new remaster of Halloween 5 looks and sounds great. New details in almost every scene really flesh out exactly how great this film's cinematography is and all the distinct stylistic choices the director made. I especially like when two characters are trying visit a little girl at the hospital and you can clearly see Michael Myers looming in the background. Now you could always tell he was there, but i bet you never noticed he had a weapon in each hand! (if you did, congratulations!)<br /> Also the new audio sounds fantastic, and is much better than the audio on the Halloween 4 bluray. Included in this release is a commentary with H5's Michael Myers' himself, Don Shanks, and the info he has to share is priceless, including talking about deleted death scenes, and how he speaks on how the film was described to him, making some of this info very interesting and valuable to fellow fans.<br /> The bonus features aren't spectacular but whatever, I'm just happy to have to the bluray.
B007BVT5N4|1.0|Bad book about a spoiled rich kid.  He appears to think he is just starting.  Face it, he`ll be out in a month or two.  DO NOT READ THIS TRASH.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love my Bible app! I use it on my phone kindle and computer. I love the catch me up feature and the reading plans!
030758836X|3.0|Some couples are described as being a perfect match: made for each other. Gillian Flynn takes that notion to the extreme in her entertaining novel, Gone Girl. Wife Amy has gone missing on her fifth wedding anniversary to husband, Nick. Exposition in the novel alternates between Amy and Nick, and Flynn delighted me as she made these two characters totally unsympathetic to any reader. There are two sides to every relationship, and Flynn shows us the worst in both sides of this very toxic marriage. By the end of the novel, I was totally entertained, and satisfied that Nick and Amy are a perfect match. Readers who like offbeat, dark humor are those most likely to enjoy this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
1469984202|5.0|If you want a review of the story, there are plenty of other five star reviews - I agree with all of them! I am purely writing this because in the Q&A, the author says he reads all of his reviews, and I want to say PLEASE keep telling this story! I am a long-time reader of scifi and fantasy and really anything I can get my hands on, and this was the best thing I've read in ages. Keep it up!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was a bit skeptical at first about trying out this series. I kept seeing it on TV, and talked about on blogs and in magazines. I kept hearing it being referred to as Twilight Fan Fiction. But once I read the summary of the book, I thought the story might be inspired by it, but it is definitively nothing like Twilight.  After putting it off for a while I did decide to read it. To me the story was pretty good. Ana is a college student who helps out her sick friend Kate interview Christian Grey, CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc. for the university newspaper. As soon as they meet they seem to become intrigued by each other.  Ana sees Christian as someone who likes control too much and doesn't know how to have an ounce of real fun.  Christian sees her as someone who is a bit unorganized, and has shy tendencies.  They end up meeting not very long after that again and their relationship progresses. As the book progressed I saw a bit more background on Christian and what made him the man he is. He and Ana seem to have an instant connection/attraction to each other and no matter how hard they may try to fight it, they give into the feels, despite some reservations. I liked the story. I sometimes compare it to a soap opera. Sometimes the acting is good, sometimes not so much, but you just have to keep watching it to find out what happens next. That is how I felt with this series. I got to know the characters, and immediately I was hooked. I needed to find out how the rest of their story played out. It's an addicting series that I would recommend. I enjoyed it, and ended up reading the other two books in the series.
1439102732|1.0|Read about a third of this book but finally gave up, which I almost never do.  What a disappointment.  Lopsided portrayal of the Christian right.  Have read and loved most of Jodi's books but this one fell flat.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy and fun for kids. very entertaining. earn coins fast. easy to understand.  love ice age. its free to down load. most kids will be able to play with no problems.

B0081HLM2E|5.0|I had been eagerly awaiting the film adaptations of Jo Nesbo's books and was surprised when [[ASIN:B008KTYLZS HEADHUNTERS by Jo, Nesbo (Author) on Sep-06-2011 Paperback]] was chosen as the first to make it to the silver screen. This was an excellent interpretation and, as other have said, once the initial 25 or so minutes are through, establishing the real Roger Brown, the film matches the break-neck chain of events as Roger's world unravels in seemingly unconnected incidents.<br /><br />All acting is truly superb, but especially that of Aksel Hennie in the lead role. The scene when he starts piecing the situation together in the river is particularly moving. It is so much better and believable than the usual unbelievable \\"victim suddenly becomes hero\\" turnaround that we get with Hollywood movies.<br /><br />Yes, the film omits a few elements of the book, such as the nature of the relationship between Clas and Lotte, and speeds through others, but the overall storyline is kept true.<br /><br />Overall a great film that will have you on the edge of your chair, even without having read the book.<br /><br />One personal recommendation - watch it in the original Norwegian with English subtitles. The voices that were chosen to dub this into American simply do not fit the characters.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|I am most pleased with my quite recent purchase of this CD. I certainly recommend Keane's music highly. Very enjoyable!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the variety of options. I don't have to listen to the same sound every time. Being able to put 2 or more sounds creates even more options. The sounds are even adjustable. I find several sounds to be very relaxing. I've listened to a lot of relaxation cds/sounds. This is the first one that I actually like!
0345531930|4.0|Rainmaker is a very good novel. Couldn't help but laugh out loud several times throughout. If I didn't know better I would have thought that I knew Mrs. Birdie personally. She certainly reminds me of some people I know.  If you read the book before watching the movie you will be very, very disappointed. I was expecting the movie having Matt Damon, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover in it and Francis Ford Coppola directing would have been better than what it was. The book is by far so much better.
030758836X|1.0|The book is pure torture.  I stayed with it because of the reviews, looking for some redeeming feature.  There was none.<br />With a couple of exceptions all characters are pathetic with him being amoraly weak and her being amoraly self centered and cruel.<br />Nothing to enjoy with the ending being the worst of all.
B007G92QGO|5.0|A bit of a dark legal thriller. Courtroom drama and all the fears it brings. Every parents worst nightmare come true, when a DA finds himself having to assist in defending his son on a charge of murder. While reading this book, my heart was constantly in my throat wondering what terrible circumstances for a family to find themselves in, when your child is accused of killing a classmate. A good read, which I could not put down. This is a story at the heart of every parent!
0525478817|2.0|I did not enjoy this book.  I did not find it \\"life affirming\\" like many reviews have stated.  I found this book to simply be depressing as hell.<br />Don't get me wrong, I don't need a book to be all roses and sunshine for it to be worth reading....but there needs to be a little light.<br />Besides that, I just didn't find any of the characters in the books to be very realistic (except for Hazel's dad).  The teens are all way to \\"wise beyond their years\\" and far too witty.  That's just always a turn off for me.  The author of Hazel's favorite book (I probably should have looked it up) also rang incredibly false to me. Sure he's a drunk....but I just refuse to believe he'd actually be THAT repugnant.<br />Also, being a gamer, it's a pet peeve of mine when games are presented in an overly phony way....and they never did explain how a blind kid could play.<br /><br />Anyway, it just didn't hold any value for me.  I wish it had.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Bought this game by mistake so I just installed it and now I'm glad I made that mistake...

6305807086|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't know who would give this movie anything more than a one star? I actually stopped the movie in the middle and threw it in the garbage
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a nicely done side scroller. There are in app purchases but I've played almost the whole thing and haven't needed to use any. I wish there were mite games as good as this for android.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|I watched this movie like a month ago, and meant to give it a review at that time but before I could sit down at the computer, I completely forgot about it. Just saw it was recommended for me on Amazon and remember I meant to give it a bad review. This was such a blatant ploy to try and rope in anyone who saw 300 and wanted to see more of that. It worked for me, but fortunately I just rented it. Visually it resembled 300, except the direction was terrible. It went into slow motion at completely ridiculous times, and then sped up and slowed back down like the director was trying to find a certain part of the movie he liked but forgot where it was so he kept fast forwarding it, then slowing it down, then fast forwarding it etc. Not a single actor in this movie came across as sincere, and most were just corny. The plot was really simple and not gripping at all. The action scenes were cool but the complete misuse of slow motion made it impossible to get into it. The gods were all apparently severely mentally retarded and couldn't figure out what was going on, or why they had powers or what they wanted to use them for. They could only use their powers when it didn't really matter, and then when anything of importance happened they had to stay out of it, but never did. Their entire dialogue was so ridiculous that it made everything else in the movie look intelligent and that's saying a lot. Bottom line, if you feel like watching a tutorial on how not to use slow motion in an action movie, put this on mute and pay attention. If you feel like anything else, watch something else or go ride a bike or something.
B0038AUYJ6|2.0|The kindle edition suffers from an annoying problem in chapter 2.  The chapter consists of tables of paragraphs forming a chronology.  The text in the table is tiny, and when you click on it to expand it, most of the time the table cell rotates so that you have to read that page in landscape mode.  Then you have to click twice to move on to the next \\"page\\" of the table, and then expand it again and rotate the kindle again.  This goes on for the whole chapter.  It undoubtedly works in the paper book; not on the Kindle (K3).
B000002I99|5.0|Either Love it or Hate it, this album is truly a must have in any collection. But yes, buy the CD so you can get the full version of the song Welcome to My Nightmare, not the silly single format. My favorite song off this record was The Black Widow, just saying, haha.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|There is definently 2 of this. I have an app called lil flippers, and this is the exact same thing. Lil flippers came out before, too. Lil flippers is way better, with more obstacles and challenges. Everyone should get lil flippers, not this copier. The controls are the same. They both have power ups. They both have obstacles. Lil flippers has more than just one course though, and that makes lil flippers much better. This can get old after a while, with just one course.<br /><br />To summarize it, get lil flippers and leave this in the dust.

0307719219|5.0|One line summary from this immensely interesting book is that inclusive political and economic institutions are what make a nation successful. Also, a statistical turn at a critical juncture in a nation's history plays an important role as well. Inclusion means most population of a country participate in the political and economic processes of a country. Lack of such atmosphere ensures the failure of a nation. An example is North Korea. Whereas South Korea started from the same position at the end of the Korean war, it grew by leaps and bounds whereas the dictatorial North Korea languished.<br /><br />Conflicts do arise in dealing with property, contracts, business settlements etc. A proper way of resolving conflict is dependent on the economic and political institutions of a country. Absent such a process, it robs the incentive to work, let alone any incentive to undertake investments and innovations.<br /><br />Growth can also come through extractive institutions, but will not be sustainable in the long run. Slavery in the southern US, sugar plantations in Jamaica are examples of such extractive institutions. Authors say that the current Chinese growth is also through extractive institutions and is not likely to be sustainable.  In China, there are other reasons as well. Property rights are not entirely secure. Some entrepreneurs are expropriated. The connection between business and the party is highly lucrative for both.<br /><br />Technological innovations are required to make human societies prosperous, but also involves the replacement of the old with the new. Dictators and elite always have a vested interest in preserving the old and profiting from it. Tsar Nicholas I  feared that the railways would bring revolution to Russia. Siaka Stevens in Sierra Leone shelved a half built railway line out of the same fear.  Similarly, the opposition to the printing press had the obvious consequences for low levels of literacy, education, and economic success in the Ottoman empire.<br /><br />In England in 1215, the Barons stood up against King John and made him sign the Magna Carta. The Barons further created a council for consultation before the King could raise taxes. After the glorious revolution of 1689, King William and the Parliament negotiated a new constitution. Bank of England was created in 1694 as a source of funds for the Industry. In 1760 the combination of all these factors-improved and new property rights, improved infrastructure, a changed fiscal regime, greater access to finance, and aggressive protection of traders and manufacturers, led to a jump in the number of patented inventions, and eventually led to the Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />Spain was forged in 1492 with the merger of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon via the marriage of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. They expropriated property from the Jews who were made to leave Spain without their wealth. They financed the conquistador trips to Latin America, which was colonized brutally through the creation of extractive institutions. Both Spain and Latin America did not prosper as a result.<br /><br />As a part of Meiji restoration in Japan, resulting from US influence in Japan in the 19th century, the shoguns and the samurai class were abolished, leading to the destruction of feudalism. Individual property rights were introduced and infrastructure building began. Steamship line between Tokyo and Osaka and the first railway line between Tokyo and Yokohama were built. In 1890 Japan became the first Asian country to adopt a written constitution, with a constitutional monarchy an elected parliament, the Diet, and independent judiciary. These factors enabled Japan to be the primary beneficiary from the Industrial Revolution in Asia.<br /><br />In the US, the Homestead act of 1862 was a pluralistic and inclusive act when many settlers got free land. While more than 600,000 were killed in the US Civil War, the planter elites suffered very few casualties. Thelaw exempted one slave holder for every 20 slaves held from war services. They ensured the plantation economy even after the war. President Rutherford Hayes needed southern support in exchange for pulling out Union soldiers. This led to Jim Crow laws. As a result the South did not develop much. Only after civil rights movement in the 1960s did the South start catching up with the North.<br /><br />When a country consists of multiple tribes, lack of political centralization means lack of law and order. Stability can result only when one group of people is sufficiently more powerful than others to build a state. Somalia is an example with multiple clans with no central authority. It is an example of a failed nation. On the contrary, Seretse Khama politically centralized Botswana after Independence, established English as a common medium, used diamond money to invest in public services. As a result, Botswana is a well governed state in Africa with the fastest growth.<br /><br />Examples of Botswana, Japan, US, England amply illustrate the point of inclusive economic and political institutions leading to prosperity. The authors strongly make their case with lot of detailed history. A book worth reading more than once.
B007SGM084|5.0|The first and second book were the best amongst the three. The events in the third book were beyond expected so I would have liked to see a plot that was a bit unpredictable instead. It is an easy read though. I understand why it became a hit cause it is what every girl wants in this world, marry a hot gazillionaire who is in love w her.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great app ideally enjoy playing this game. its easy to use and i like how the game looks
B0072IVGZG|4.0|I saw this lineup about one-and-a-half years ago , and they kicked ass , period .<br />This CD is their best work since the Love/Electric era in my honest opinion . And if the people posting here say it's a bad CD .... well they are NOT true Cult fans .<br />Keep rockin' Ian , Billy and the band ! Great CD from a very , very talented band \m/
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is one of he games where you can play it and not get tired of it in my opinion. This is definently better than the free version.
0345803507|5.0|I really cannot add anything else to my review that has not already been said.  I wish the series would have been dragged out a little longer.  I can't wait to see what she writes next.
B008ANFRGQ|2.0|I was hoping for something better than this.  I've been reading all the rave reviews and wondering if Amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest. My first impression was, \\"Sales of the 7 string must be down...time to over use it again.\\"<br /><br />I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Vai.  I do not love Story of Light.  I can't even give a coherent explanation why at this point.  I made it through the first listen and was thankful that I only spent the money on the download.<br /><br />His tone is brilliant, his playing is still out of this world.  I've loved him and his quirky composing since Flex Able.  This one is a miss.  Though there are some high points, they quickly come down and stay there most of the time.  I won't waste our time giving you a song by song review.  Buy it and judge for yourself.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I felt a little obligated to read this series because my boys were so interested.  They wanted to talk to me about the books so I decided to give it a try.  Overall it was a good read but not something that I would need to reread.
B00881VLCE|1.0|very disappointed in this app... i lost all eight puzzels i had paid for... i could not get them back... so very frustrating. what could have happened to them... the application is stored in the cloud but not my specific puzzels. i had to get a refund for all the money i had spent and am now expected to download all the puzzels again.even the application support person was confusing. please donot get this app.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|great app. lets you know how much battery you have depending on what your doing. on down side is it pops up every time you plug into the wall.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This album shows Rodriguez's versatility. The songs are so personal and emotional.  I can listen to this album all day. His music is very calming and relaxing.  This is a nice change from what we have to listen to being played on the radio today.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is great tool when you want to see how much battery life you have using different functions. I would give it 5 stars if it would give you a time frame for charging your device.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This album exceeded my expectations. The songs are relevant to today.  It's like the album was just released today. Rodriguez is an awesome artist. I'm only sorry I did not get this album sooner.
B0071BY1T2|5.0|I aim to be as good or even better. Been playing for afew years now. But when I watched this video, I knew this is where I wanted to be.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Wanted to see this mostly because I'm a big science fiction/fantasy and History fan and Shaun of the Dead, Walking Dead lover.  Alright, It piqued my interest.  Didnt read the book (my daughter did though and liked it).  So, the story line was good...even semi-believable if you stretch things some and are a bit of a conspiracy theorist.  The action was definitely there.  I thought it was told more along the line of a comic book which I thought fit perfectly.  Had cheesy computer graphics, but once again, this fit the movie plus I'm pretty sure they didnt expect to challenge Avatar with this.  All in all an enjoyable movie. Will buy for my collection when dvd comes out.  Loved it!
B005CS3VQ0|3.0|I'm not a linguist and don't have any background in the translation business, so I can't comment on the accuracy of what is presented.<br /><br />I did, however, enjoy reading the book.  I read the whole book over the course of the week, entertained by the tales of the plasticity and fuzziness of language, and how difficult it is for true translations to be made, and what that even means.<br /><br />It was well-written and worth a read.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|I watched this show as a child and always enjoyed it. Watching all these years later I still do.  The acting is good with lots of highly talented supporting actors. The plots were simple but always had a gentle moral character with some subtle humor. Supporting actors play a very important part in adding to the quality of a show and greaters picked ones of that day which were well known and fit their parts.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love this app ... very relaxing and lots of options to mix and change depending on your mood.  wish it could be played as background when using other apps on my kindle fire but otherwise wonderful.
B006S009IY|5.0|Great acting and writing. This is not a documentary on the author of Peter Pan, but rather an artistic interpretation of the essence of his book and it's message. It's so great to see Johnny Depp in something that's not Tim Burton-weird. He really is a great great actor, as seen in this film. Kate Winslet is wonderful as well, as the mother. loved this movie.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I am extremely satisfied with this product because it has centralized all of the blogs I read into one easy to manage location.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|As always, Charlize Theron, is great in this film...she depicts the typical 30-something generation today, who are in a state of arrested development. I know more ppl like her, in just observing, who are reality-show-wannabes than care to know about. It's in the media, everywhere, the Kardashians, to name one, as their role models.  In the film, the 'happy' ppl of her home town, can't relate to her search for something that is no longer there: her lost youth as the popular, beautiful girl in school. Trying to replicate that same feeling about herself by going back to reclaim her high school boyfriend is just a symptom of her desperate effort to recapture herself when she was her 'best.' This may or not be described as a comedy, but it definitely is not. This movie takes a serious look at how painful it can be to avoid growing up.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Bought this by listening to samples on Amazon. When it arrived, was very pleased with music selection. Almost got 5 stars - no body is perfect.
0525952616|5.0|I really like this book, technology and intense action make a great combo.

B006LQQ1GE|3.0|One really good song \\"Someone I Used To Know\\" - rest of CD - I would rate as OK - over all not a bad buy
B007STBUIW|5.0|I've loved this movie from the time it came out. That said, everybody knows about this movie so there is no point in rehashing all of that. This is short and sweet for people like me that have the DVD and wonder if it's worth the upgrade to BluRay. Yes, it definitely is. Most noticeably to me, in the opening sequence I have always felt it was too dark when the girl is out in the water awaiting her fate. Either they lightened it up a notch or just the higher definition brings out the detail to it. The rest of the movie follows suit. Great clarity, color and definition. I'm not a videophile but the picture and sound are much better to me than in previous versions, so for me it was well worth the upgrade.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use love the huge display. makes it easy to budget and balance my account. I would recommend this app to my friends
034580404X|1.0|This is not good literature, not even good erotic literature, nor  entertaining. I think the author must have a great marketing team to have made these books so popular.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book is superficial using trite situations and unlikely personal characteristics for the characters.<br />The people involved are shallow and unbelievable. But then, I'm no author and probably cant do any better,<br />but I can certainly READ better.
0345525558|3.0|This book contains a great deal of heartbreak and frustration.  First, the main character, Victoria, flops her way through the foster care system in a journey for self-love and acceptance. The idea for the book of Victoria communicating through flowers is a beautiful and healing theme. The problem for me is that the main character, Victoria, is so unlikeable. She's mean and nasty and I just couldn't connect with her. Had the author done a better job in showing her humanness, her vulnerability and giving us a glimpse that there is a decent person down there, I would have been more inclined to be in her corner, rooting for her to discover that she is strong enough to handle what comes her way; she's not a victim. True, she's down on her luck, both from the hand she was dealt and her own choices, but her internal self-hatred is like fire, destroying everything in its path - good and bad.  And -- just as there is some progress --  there is a huge transgression and it's how she handled this transgression that finally made me want to toss the book at the wall (yes, I am being somewhat ambiguous as to not give away the plot).  Overall, it's a good read and highlights the children need stability and someone to love them and not leave them as well as major flaws in the foster care system. I'd recommend reading it, but I also suggest getting it from the library and not buying it. It's not a book I'd read more than once.
0061692042|2.0|As a Montana transplant who lived in Great Falls for a year and found the place fascinating, I recently read the novella \\"Wildlife,\\" which is set in Great Falls in 1960 and tells the story of a marital crisis between a couple from the perspective of their affectless and seemingly sexually unaware 15-year old son. They're outsiders in Great Falls.  the husband is happy-go-lucky but hapless and entertains ill-advised ideas for solving his unemployment. Eventually this leads to a scheme which causes a serious rift with his emotionally mismatched wife.<br /><br />Despite the failings of the book - the comical obliviousness of the narrator, who seems more like the young Forrest Gump sitting outside while his mom bangs the principal; his utter lack of self outside his parents, despite being a teenager, albeit isolated in an unfamiliar town; and, most annoyingly, the tendency of characters to speak in cryptic pronouncements about their condition, rather than the events of the book, or to engage in realistic family dialogue - it was well-written and had some emotional truth to it.<br /><br />So I decided to read \\"Canada,\\" which from reviews I knew treated the same subject in greater detail. Surprise! There's little difference, except the narrator has a sister, the mother is the temperamental opposite of the one in \\"Wildlife,\\" has an even more strained relationship with the father, and things end up much more badly. There are other details - men with limps, vague discussion of the 1960 election - which are very similar to the former book.<br /><br />Worse, everyone speaks in pronouncements and the narrator is the same bland 15-year old, this time named Dell. ***OK, SPOILER ALERTS COMING*** The act of incest between Dell and his twin sister (unless I'm missing something) is ridiculous and unbelievable. It barely seems to register with the narrator - unless it's one of those things he just chooses to forget or something - and his sexuality is non-existent, except that once inCanada he starts to realize he's interested in girls, in some sort of PG-13 way. Dell is still only really interested in Chess and bee-keeping. (On the other hand, the girls at the orphanage school are consumed by animal sexuality; I actually found this passage quite haunting).<br /><br />Yeah, so there's a whole second half to the book, but Dell remains bland, and the events strain credulity. How does Neeva, the mother who refuses to \\"assimilate\\" in Montana, know the sister of an extremist and choose for Dell to live with him? (I think it may be implied that Neeva is herself something of a closet extremist and was associated with the network which protects Arthur, though they are opposites in many ways). Then nothing really happens in Canada until a backstory is conveniently laid out by an unlikely character. One reviewer described this as a \\"MacGuffin,\\" and indeed it is.<br /><br />The end of the book is narrated by the retirement-aged Dell, and reveals him as a politically smug and unfeeling person - perhaps as a consequence of his needing to do what had to be done to get through his ordeals. Nonetheless, his lack of feeling toward his father and dying sister - who is the real tragic figure, and more realistic - I found bothersome.<br /><br />Ford writes well - magnificently in places - about the the confusion of adolescence and interior thoughts. But it is tiresomely repetitive and ultimately overly cryptic and abstract.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i have only read 3 pages of this book and omg this book is sooooo amazing!!!  i am soooooo amazed with suzanne collins you are so awesome!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the mini games and its not that hard to earn points. I wish it wasn't so expensive to unlock most of the games tho!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome and a great time waster! why give it only one star? I play it all the time
1451629184|5.0|I read this book over the course of two days, and Jaycee's story touched me to the depths of my soul. I was amazed at how beautifully she writes, given the fact that her education was cut short when she was kidnapped. Some reviewers mentioned their discomfort over the graphic details in the novel, but that was exactly Jaycee's intent. She wasn't going to gloss over and sugar-coat what two horrible monsters forced her to endure for nearly two decades. I was in tears when I finished the book, and I can't remember the last time that happened. Jaycee is a courageous, inspiring young woman and this book is a must read for anyone who thinks they've got it bad in life.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|For anyone who loves dogs and understands their loyalty to their owners, this movie is for you.  It is based on a true story of a dog named Hachiku that waited 10 years for his deceased owner to come back for him (look it up on the internet).  Of course, this is the Americanized version of the true Japanese story, but it is, by all means, a fair account.  Be prepared to cry your eyes out, though, because as this story proves, the true loyalty and unconditional love of a dog for its owner is very special.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've been using it daily since January 2012 and I've never experienced a crash or a failure to sync or any of  of the other issues I've seen mentioned in the reviews. I  use it on my kindle Fire, iPhone, and MacBook Pro to take notes for school.
B008VBYN80|5.0|So far I have really enjoyed this game. It is possible to have a rewarding game experience without spending real-world money. Only problem as with other Gameloft titles finding new friends for neighbors is difficult. A forum would be nice. To add me, go to your Gameloft account, to Friends, search add new, and my name is:  Muirely
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app. able to keep track of when i need to recharge.  i recommend this app. very easy to understand
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|This is absolutely the best television series I have ever seen.  I guess I'm lucky, because I get it with Amazon Prime free streaming.  I keep going back to it when I need good entertainment.  The writing ( for the most part ) is excellent.  One episode was weak in that respect in my view.  But nobody hits a homerun every time they bat....  The characters, the script, the acting, the story, the effects, the inter action between the actors ( chemistry ) was unbelievable.  You seriously have to wonder why the dead brains cancelled this show.  Best Sci-Fi ever....  I really can't find anything bad to say about this series, it's outstanding.  Watch it, you'll get hooked....
B0070Y46UY|3.0|At first glace this is so not a book I would normally pick up, but after seeing the trailer for the movie, i just knew i needed to read this story.<br /><br />The story follows Patel (Pi) through his findings of many different religions, which eventually he accepts all of them into his heart. His father runs a zoo in India, giving Pi the opportunity to learn about animals and how they behave. Pi is a very bright and opinionated boy. His family eventually decides to move to Canada. they travel by boat bringing their animals with them. Some are to be sold some are to be given to other zoo's. Pi barely escapes the ship sinking into the Pacific ocean and ends up on a lifeboat with several animals, including a Bengal Tiger! The main part of the story takes place with Pi and the animals aboard the life boat as he trys to survive.<br /><br />Pi suffers greatly upon his journey, both physically and spiritually. He finds his way to adapt to the surroundings. He shows his courage to keep on living even though his situation is horrible and practically helpless.<br /><br />At first glace this is so not a book I would normally pick up, but after seeing the trailer for the movie, i just knew i needed to read this story. In general i really enjoyed this book. I was weary at first to read and was, in away, not what i expected, but it was good unexpected. my only complaint about the story was some of the graphic scenes, but I'm also not good with those things in general. I also didn't care for the very ending if the story. The interview Pi has with the maritime officials is weird. It also left me with many questions as to what happened to Pi later on. Overall this was a nice read and i'm looking forward to the movie to see its take on the book.
B008CT2CV6|5.0|i like this one better then the first one because this one was not a spin off of a older movie
B0087HT36U|5.0|fun not too difficult mindless yet very addictive and entertaining. plenty of levels and difficult achievements keep it from being boring
034580404X|4.0|I have completed the first 2 books of the trilogy and I have been enjoying it.  I am though getting tired of all the sex and  I'm wondering if we are going to have more story and less sex in book 3.  I want to learn more about fifty's childhood and I hope book  3 will elaborate more.
B0086700CM|5.0|I spend most of my time in playing this game.<br />cool game to play. run and score . run run run run
B007N85ZXY|4.0|My 19 year old loves this CD. So do I. First listen through, I could not wait to hear the next track. NY and CH rock these tunes while respecting the fact that these songs reflected social protest or the dark reality of everyday life in early North America. It keeps getting better the more I listen. Overall thanks to Neil Young for making these tunes new again. Edgy lyrics + raw and raucous!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is trash, I hated it, don't waste your time.  The sample reads nothing like the rest of the book, very disappointed.
B000JPRPAO|3.0|mini coopers. lots of noise. cracking safes. fun gizmos. all that awesome stuff hidden beneath a cloud, a heavy fog if you will, of complete boredom.
0345803485|5.0|I loved all 3 books Fifty shades darker(the 2nd book) was my favorite. I am gonna start reading them again. I wish there were more to the sequel than just 3 books. Rave reviews from me.
0807126063|5.0|John Kennedy Toole was the recipient of the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  The Pulitzer was posthumously awarded.  The novel was written in the early-mid 1960's.  The author committed suicide in 1969 at the age of only 32.  After his death, the previously unknown manuscript was discovered by the author's mother who then successfully lobbied for its publication, which eventually occurred in 1980.  The novel is a fascinating insite into OCD and intriguing characters in a compelling environment. There is also an excellent \\"audio book\\" available.  The reading of the novel is enhanced when followed by reading to learn more about the author...\\"Butterfly in the Typewriter: The Tragic Life of John Kennedy Toole and the Remarkable Story of A Confederacy of Dunces\\" by Cory MacLauchlin  and \\"Ken and Thelma: The Story of A Confederacy of Dunces\\" by Joel L. Fletcher.
0425238091|5.0|Great read even if a little dated now.  If you have an interest in medical training at a top rated hospital in the last century this book is for you.  Really sheds some light on how our physicians were trained.
0345803485|1.0|I purchased this book based on a friend's recommendation. Thought it would be a good summer read; titillating and fun.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I refuse to dedicate anymore of my Kindle's battery power to this poorly written, plotless novel. I don't like any of the characters. Ana is the BDSM Bella and Christian is Edward. Jose - you guessed it. Jacob. Or maybe not. I'm not going to get far enough in the book to see if there's any tension between Ana-Bella and Jose-cob.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or your money. Excuse my while I go reread \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\".
B000F3A7LO|5.0|I consider this album a ground-breaking classic which helped open my ears. Already a Peter Gabriel fan when I first heard the album, I had not expected anything I had not heard before, but the version of \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" goes beyond the version on Gabriel's first album (popularly referred to as Car). Of coure, \\"Exposure\\", the title track, also appears on Gabriel's second album, known as \\"Scratch\\". The musicians on Exposure clearly demonstrate Fripp's ability and desire to work with others, which is much of why the album is so diverse. Fripp is astounding throughout the album, while not overshadowing his guests' talents. Tony Levin and Jerry Marotta of course, worked extensively with Gabriel through the years, while Levin became a long standing member of King Crimson. While many of Fripp's other solo album often strike me as being too similar to each other, this album is really something different. It was around the time that I first heard this album that I first heard the Crimson classic Red, which left me somewhat boggled, and wishing I could understand it. After listening to Exposure a few times, and then Crimson's Discipline, I was able to bridge the gap from more popish things like Peter Gabriel and enter a new arena of listening experience. I would say that you probably have to have a desire to disturb yourself a bit to grab onto this album, but for those who desire, it is a good place to start. It is also an excellent album to find some roots.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|this pissed me off because i had gotten really far in the game, and it said i had to update it, and when i did it erased all my data.so I deleted it
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I made a point of watching this movie before seeing the final one.  I had seen it before but was surprised to realize how little I really remembered.  It is satisfyingly complex.  Well worth the second viewing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Subject says it all. Great puzzle type game, very fun (and sometimes frustrating to get a perfect score, but that's a plus imo)
B006OCM0G0|2.0|This is a click-to-do game like FarmVille, but easier. Mostly it's about deciding which recipe to cook on which stove. Like Farm Ville, with a spread sheet, things are pretty obvious.<br /><br />The worst thing is that if the display goes blank or you go to a home screen, everyone heads for the exit without paying. It truly steals from you.<br /><br />What a time sucker.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I like how it can be saved and go to my gallery at the same time ( love this app).
B00571F26Y|4.0|I would normally be skeptical about a book called \\"Wheat Belly\\".I am a health conscious person with a healthy lifestyle and diet, but was finding it difficult to shift about 5kgs of visceral fat.  Earlier this year I read the fascinating book Diet Evolution by Dr Steven Gundry.  Dr Gundry advocates removing all grains from our diet (\\"a healthy grain is an oxymoron\\") and so I was open to what Dr Davis had to say about wheat. And after reading this book, I took action!  Within two weeks, my waist size dropped by 2 inches.  And I am slowly releasing weight. I am following Dr Gundry's recommendations, but it was the bread at lunchtime that was putting the brakes on, and they are now off!  I am a bit of a 'how do the cells work' person, and Dr Davis helped me to understand the role of cholesterol more thoroughly - I like the detail he gives on our body's biology.  Last year, my Naturopath told me to go on a gluten-free diet - and I have done more than that and I am feeling great!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Ok I kept seeing ppl talk abou this book.I never any reviews so I didn't know anything about it.<br />I started reading got sucked in.This book is a Emotional Rollercoaster.Written well I cried through the whole damn book.lol I don't know anyone could read this book & not cry. It was a awesome book I didn't know anything about \\"Slamming\\" it was great. I learned & I felt the Slam from every page I read.  More than 5🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
B008S4YZCO|4.0|This game rocks! It is really fun. I just don't like having to wait for my monster to be ready to fight again.  Other wise it's awesome!
0385495323|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, so much so that I later bought several other books (\\"Big Bang\\" and \\"Fermat's Enigma\\") by the same author.  Very well written and entertaining if you're into mathematics and science.  Highly recommended.
0425263908|3.0|Having read the Fifty Shades trilogy first, I didnt get the same feeling reading bared to you.<br />I didnt feel the same connection between Eva and Gideon that Christian and Anastasia had<br />Really what can one say about the book...same premise, same events take place<br />Not a favorite of mine by any means, glad it was a library rental as opposed to buying it
B008MM9630|4.0|the game is ok. its a good way to pass some time. you are a fairy, taking care of a garden, learning magic, and taming animals. the only problem I am having is that it kicks me out of the game when I sign in with my FB account.
B003Y5H5FQ|1.0|Finally got around to watching this remake and must say that I wasn't surprised by how bad it sucks ... no pun intended!  The original is so much better than this recycled garbage it's not even fun!  Even the special effects seemed as though they were something out of a \\"B\\" movie.  Charlie was such a wuss and a douche bag that I was actually rooting for Jerry this time around!  Colin Farrell actually makes a great villian, just to bad the rest of the cast blows!  If your looking for a good vampire flick, look elsewhere because this isn't it.  Just hope they don't try to remake Interview with a Vampire ... that would be a freaking disaster ... lol!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\" is the best book I have read since \\"The Help\\".<br />The characters are rich and well developed; the plot is cleverly woven to quickly involve you emotionally.<br />Grissom has wisely used her research of plantations and slave labour to build a believable, compelling read.<br />It was wonderful.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|This review is limited to the 2011 Two-disc Special Edition. When I opened the case, both of the discs looked absolutely identical.  There is no obvious labeling for \\"disc 1\\" or \\"disc 2.\\"  At first I thought there was a packaging error and I got two of the same disc.  The only way to tell disc 1 from disc 2 is that the serial/product numbers printed on the other edge of the face of the labels are different.  For your reference, should you choose to purchase this version, disc number 8018803 is disc 1 and disc number 8018805 is disc 2.  Disc 2, the special features disc, has a lot of topics.  My only complaint is that there is no \\"play all\\" option.  Since some of the special features only last about a minute, it does get a bit tedious clicking on each feature.  Quality and content of both discs are excellent.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam Harris presents a well researched argument for how we have misunderstood the meaning and importance of free will. Most people will probably be uncomfortable with the ideas, but that alone does not make them either true or false! The book is probably best understood if it is read along with \\"The moral Landscape\\".
B006XOBFJC|5.0|Janowski's Wagner is more dramatic than many other renditions. The structure of these massive works is made evident by the Conductors style. Singers are excellent. A shame that this is not available on video.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I love Will Smith's move into movies on serious topics, and this one is no exception. The story of a man's struggle to move from homelessness into a meaningful and fascinating career.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|True story: I hate cats.  Yet, I like this book.  It's like having a cat without having a cat.  And it's funny. So, it's like having a funny cat without having a funny cat.  Sort of.  Anyway, I liked it and I think you should buy it.  Please.<br /><br />Even if you hate cats.<br /><br />I said, please.
0062024329|2.0|I read Coelho's book before trying this graphic novel. In comparison, I found the graphics distracting; I was less able to imagine the characters while reading as I was forced to look at the artists rendition of their faces, which was different than I had pictured them. The artist is talented, so not for any lack of skill, but it was just too much.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking to become acquainted with The Alchemist, I would suggest reading the first book, not the graphic novel.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book out of curiosity, as it is a bestseller.  What is the attraction, I wondered.  Having read two-thirds of it (I could endure no more), I don't know why it sells so well.  It is one of the dumbest books of all time. Young woman meets kinky rich guy and their physical relationship is described in minute detail.  It is poorly written and boring.  Is the average person so stupid and so starved of intimacy that this book is a turn on?  I guess so. DUMB.  DUMB.  DUMB Book.
030758836X|4.0|Another good book from Gillian Flynn that is a definite page turner!  The juxtaposition of the two main character's \\"stories\\" is a good technique for this love story/mystery.  You will keep reading to get to the end and it will keep you guessing the whole way.  Definitely not your typical love story!
B007XH6BPG|5.0|This is a very exciting release from a casual collaboration between Chris Squire (YES) and Steve Hackett (ex-Genesis).  The music is fantastic, Chris' voice is angelical and Steve's guitar playing is superb... the vocal harmonies are top-notch.  These two masters make wonderful and exciting prog-Pop music.  Everything sounds fresh and inspired.  I think this is the best medium for Squire at this point.  Hopefully, this album will be followed by others from them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an enjoyable book and had some nice plot twists.  It was a relatively fast read and I found I wanted to spend more time reading than is my normal habit (reading from bedtime to sleep).
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Loved the first book.  Martin creates amazing characters and a world that are so engaging you can't put the books down.  But now he ends each massive tome with cliffhangers and abandons those characters while he covers others in the next one.  At this point it feels like he's just milking the whole thing to last for 7 or 8 books.  Originally I loved the fact that he could raise a character up to heights of power and then snatch it all away (usually along with their head) so you could never quite predict where things were going.  Well, now he's done it so many times that it is absolutely predictable that no character's valorous attempts to cross the world and reach for glory will be met with anything but abject, crushing failure.  Even as most of the characters I liked were mercilessly destroyed there were just enough surviving to give me hope that some of my loyalties would be ultimately rewarded but alas, now even those few have been dispatched.  Or maybe not, since half of the killed characters return somehow and at this point I'm pretty much desensitized to caring what happens to anyone.  Maybe a ten foot stag will show up with a dead rider to save the day (it happened earlier).  Even the couple of people I could consistently hate have been destroyed or de-clawed.  The dragon queen was awesome and seemed destined to conquer the world but she fails miserably at her attempts to rule even a single city and proves herself to be a criminally neglectful pet owner chaining her beloved dragons in the dark crypts of a pyramid to turn feral.  Why do I want her to have success now?  Yes, Tyrion is awesome.  Maybe George should have stuck more to the Lannisters and the Starks and made a really awesome trilogy.  I don't know if I'll pick the next book up in five years when it's done, knowing it may be another five until the next which will hopefully wrap things up.  I may wait ten to make sure he lives long enough to complete it.  Or maybe by then I'll just ask a friend whathappens to Tyrion since he's the only one left I'm really curious about.  Excellent writing though it's getting deeper and deeper into gross bodily functions and you can almost cut your reading in half if you skip the descriptions of the colors and sigils of what banners are flying over which siege or battlefield.  More than once I've felt like I'm reading Queer Eye for the Straight Tyrant...  Obviously I've liked what he has to offer enough to read five of the books, but at this point in the journey I am more apt to discourage someone from getting involved in the series than to recommend it.
B000FCK42M|5.0|I have read James Elroy's work described as \\"epic crime stories\\". The Power of the Dog fits that description. The plot takes place over a 20+ year time span and involves our government's war on drugs from many points of view, our government, the Mexican government, the church, the elites and the lowlifes. The characters from the top to the bottom are very human and realistic. And the suspense is compelling. You are hooked until the last page.<br /><br />I love this genre....Connelly, Elroy, Pelecanos and Crais. Winslow is now up there with all of them. This was my favorite read in a while.<br /><br />Greg Savino
B005IQZB14|4.0|I like books that grab your attention as soon as you start reading and this book does that.  But then it lost my full attention a little and then gained it back.  The author is very descriptive and made me feel a part of the story.  So overall I would recommend this book.
0812982622|4.0|Wow! North Korea is another world entirely<br />Almost like sci-fi!<br /><br />This book held me captive ... which would sound like a cute take on the book, except for the true horror that goes with being captive in North Korea.<br /><br />While the setting and the narrative are extremely depressing, the book is not.  There is resilience, hope and humanity underlying the heavy cover of violence and deprivation.  This is a world where it pays to be paranoid.  This is a world where you belong to the State and you only survive by accepting the propaganda.  The people are unceasingly fed a version of the \\"truth\\", to the point where group mentality is accepted as normal and where they express distress for foreigners who are not so well cared for by their governments and have to pay for goods and make their own decisions.<br /><br />This is a riveting read.  The cruel edge cuts right through.  The narrative is a patchwork, jumping back and forth on a timeline but I think I relished this as a foil to the compartmentalised prescriptive lives that the characters led.  There was a bit of everything - romance, adventure, drama, torture, innocence, depravity.
0439023491|3.0|I always argued that \\"The Hunger Games\\" would have been perfectly fine if the first book was slightly extended in order to make a fine conclusion. For the first sequel, \\"Catching Fire,\\" it starts off strong, but unfortunately flops at the end.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" occurs during the 75th tournament. Instead of picking out in a drawing of random teenagers, the draw is among all-star competitors, meaning those that have previously won the competition (it would have to be, because those who have lost are dead). Only three people have won from District 12, Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch Abernathy. Katniss was a given, as she was the only female, but the male could be chosen and then switched. That meant Peeta returned to the battleground as well.<br /><br />The group included just about every kind of possible fighter. Even those eighty years of age were competing. Then, the competition takes a highly biased turn that sets up a revolt that is bound to occur in the third of final book, \\"Mockingjay.\\"<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" enters the notion in which Katniss is \\"the chosen one,\\" which leads the network into showing its true colors. The book itself was just okay, but not really necessary. Those who read and enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games\\" are going to get stuck reading the rest of the series, but that's the strategy of creating such an empire.<br /><br />With that being said, you are going to be lured in to the rest of the series, but the two sequels do NOT match up to the original \\"Hunger Games\\" book.
B008H6GH8I|1.0|I run a mobile babysitting service from my van.<br />I was at the local Mexican grocery store picking up some treats for the kids. As I was exiting the store, I passed a folding table setup where they sell the latest movies in the theather or about to be in the theather.<br />When I saw the Resident Evil cartoon I was pretty excited (I almost dropped my groceries.) Cash only transaction, I immediately bought a copy. To be honest, most teenagers and young adults know who or what 'Resident Evil' is, but not kids. In a brilliant moves by the powers involved, this animated movie seemed like a great introduction to a younger audience.<br />Locking the van doors in a dark and abandonded parking-lot, we planned on having a fun summer spook fest watching the movie.<br />This did not play out exactly as I had hoped.<br />The animation was good, but it just wasn't a kid-friendly movie in hindsight.<br />In fact, most of the kids had soiled themselves and damaged the door of the van trying to get out. A couple of them threw up ruining the carpeted walls and floor (guess I know who won't be coming back after I send their parents the cleaning bill.)
B00846REIS|1.0|This is the most uncreative book that I have ever read.  You are better off saving your money and simply reading 50 Shades again.  Literally the only difference is that the girl is rich and damaged instead of a poor virgin.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Awesome book, great thriller,mystery felt like I was apart of the story,  I didn't want to put the book down.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great fun for those who enjoy games that challenge reflex and hand-eye coordination.  Nice graphics for a free-to-play game as well.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I like the game I wish the diamonds. did not cost real money but that is ok.  The game is fun for all ages and I shore did have  a lot of fun playing it.
034580404X|4.0|Product was brand new in perfect condition. Arrived sooner than expected. I was able to start my reading ahead of time and the books where actually cheaper than the Kindle down load.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is perfect for going to sleep with some background noise.  The variety of sounds and the ability to stack them easily is awesome.  You can have it remember your favorite combinations, too.  You can also set a timer so the app will automatically close when the specified time is up.  The free version is good enough to stand alone but the upgrade is well worth it.  I have already recommended it to friends.
B007SGM084|5.0|Yes it did. I have never read a book like that before and because of it I have now checked out a few more books and only found one that was close to it but not nearly as exciting as this series. It was not really all the eroticism in the book but the story drove me to read it thoroughly and the suspense pulled me into the books as I went on. I would have to say that this was a very intense thriller more so than a erotic book as I read through it. The out come was so well done and I liked the epologue about mister Grey's  perspective on the events and easily could have read his rendition for instense when his chopper crashed.  That could well have been a couple of chapters just on that.  So yes I could easily read more books like that as long as they have a very serious side to the story . Another book that I decided to read was good also but not in the same league was called Loves Interest

1935670913|5.0|This is the single greatest value I have yet found for book marketing advice. I have spent thousands of dollars on seminars, webinars, books, home study courses and the like developing the marketing skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the very competitive publishing world. I am very pleased with the sound, easy-to-implement marketing strategy the author presents, and the organized, logical fashion in which he lays it out. This book does not just rehash existing info that you can get all over the place. There are some unique, original ideas here that I have not seen elsewhere. I think he could take the info in this book and turn it into a 2 or 3 day seminar that people would happily pay hundreds of dollars for.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is probably one of the nicest village games I've played so far . but there are flaws such as it is trying to suck money out of you. but really you can still play it without paying.and yes the energy does run out quickly but as you advance in levels you get more energy per time. and as for mothered peoples complaints I never experienced that.

B008UUPOVM|5.0|To me this is his best album...he has matured and it shows in his music. He has lost his \\"childhood\\" pings and moved to piano and pop beats. Yes we loved the old style but I welcome his new style with open arms. He still has his old flare in all his songs that when you hear for the first time without seeing the artist name and can say that it's Owl City.<br /><br />Both \\"Shooting Star\\" and \\"Silhouette\\" are my favorites displaying that you can shine and do your best attitude in \\"Shooting Star\\" while the later being his slowest song that displays a \\"moving on with life\\" attitude with painful memories, which I connected with and I bet everyone else can too.<br /><br />Not everyone enjoys change, but I respect and accept his new turn in music and lyrics and can't wait for more in the future, keep it up Adam.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Love this game! Only problem its that I never have time for a multiplayer game and this game's single player is a little lacking in features. Like achievements, stats &amp; other things to add replayability. It is a bit of a StarCraft clone, what with the races &amp; all.
B001G8XON0|5.0|An artistic magnificent triumph.How could  anyone give ths movie a bad review.2000 amazon reviews says it all.People love this movie because they love a good love story.The Blu Ray is also incredible,the picture s perfect and the music has never sounded better.Enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book has been as wonderful to read as the first two books. I can't put the book down. The things they do in this book have been quite the eye opener to this 59 year old widow. I had a great sex life with my husband but the things in this book make me miss him even more. E L James I hope comes up with a new series of books that are as exciting. Thanks
030758836X|2.0|I didn't find any of the characters likeable, didn't like the ending, found the book slow at times.  The only good I could find with the story was its originality.
B005FISBTO|5.0|It seems strange to be fascinated with a show about a serial killer who kills serial killer but there is something addicting about DEXTER. The show keeps going on and on and the writers keep coming up with more serial killers and more scenarios for Dexter. Dexter is always one step of his pals at Miami Metro when he conducts his own investigation. Dexter could be the Sherlock Holmes of Miami if his obsession didn't have a macabre tone.<br /><br />Rocky relationships are always at the heart of Dexter. LaGuerta and Batista, Debra and Quinn, and Dexter and everyone. The relationships are so intertwined and involved. It's hard to imagine how Miami Metro ever solves a crime. Season 6 seems creepier and more gruesome that any others. Dexter is evolving and beginning to be curious about religion and faith as he enrolls Harrison in a Catholic pre-school. It's perfect timing as Miami's newest serial killings appear to be religious in nature and based on the Book of Revelation and the Apocalypse.<br /><br />Edward James Olmos as Professor James Gellar and his dedicated student Travis Marshall played by Colin Hanks are this seasons diabolical killers. They become known as the Doomsday Killers (aka DDK). Things are more serious as these killers think they are following the word of God. One of the creepiest murders is related to the Four Men of the Apocalyse. You have to see it to believe what the writers have come up with on this one.<br /><br />Dexter's mptivations and religious ambiguity are tested when he meets Brother Sam played by Def Mos. Brother Sam is a reformed ex-convict and drug addict who has seemed to have found God. Could be be the Doomsday Killer or has he really repented and switched to a life of doing good?  A lot of questions are raised in this season's episodes.<br />Even Debra begins to question her exact feelings for her adopted brother Dexter.<br /><br />In pure Dexter classic form, this season is full of surprising plot twists and our Dexter continues tosurvive near fatal escapades and still stay ahead of his Miami Metro coworkers. Miami must be one dangerous city with all the serial killers running around every year. There also must a lot of open cases in Miami as Dexter finds and disposes of the killers just as Miami Metro is steps away. The killers are never found so do the good people of Miami live in fear? Fortunately, DEXTER is a writer's fantasy and the show just keeps us addicted to the story.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|This is the very first thing I ever downloaded for my Kindle Touch last Christmas, and I've only just gotten around to reading it.  The stories of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are timeless entertainment and should not be missed.  From the very first novel, A Study in Scarlet, Doyle sets up an engaging world full of engaging people.  It's no wonder these stories have been revived so many times, most recently in the wonderful BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.<br /><br />That said, there is one issue with this Kindle edition, and that is typos.  They're not usually so bad as to render the text incomprehensible, but they are pretty frequent (every couple of pages or so), and they do often take me out of the stories for a second.  I don't think it makes this edition worth passing up, though.  I still think this is a great collection.

0743298039|5.0|This reminded me a lot of Daphne du Maurier's \\"Rebecca.\\"  The twist at the end is something original that one would never guess, either.  A perfect book to cozy up with, but it went beyond most \\"cozy mysteries\\" with its depth of characters and moving plot.

B008D28HYS|4.0|This game sounds simple at first...after all how hard can it be to simply fill in squares of certain colors when you are told how may squares should be that color?  However the challenge is in the patterns.  These squares must form the pattern given...and oh yeah the.columns also have certain color schemes as well.  I ignore any other messages or ads that appear while playing and just try to concentrate on the game.  I need to do that to solve them!  Therefore some of the complaints raised in previous reviews do not bother me, nonetheless I still would have liked this app to be just<br />a game and nothing more.

030758836X|4.0|This book was a total dark horse read for me. I've been on a streak of reading good books that I enjoy, but don't quite make it to the \\"can't put it down\\" category. I don't know what I was expecting from it, but I definitely wasn't prepared for the complete psychological mind-bender that it turned out to be. I had purposely avoided reading plot summaries and other reviews before starting it and after a friend's recommendation, I finally pulled the trigger and downloaded it.<br /><br />Usually my eyes glaze over when I read a publisher's publicity-oriented description, but in this case, it's pretty spot on. \\"Unputdownable\\" is accurate. One of the things I most admire about a writer is the ability for him or her to change the reader's loyalties to characters by the revealing of new information or plot twists. For that reason alone, I'd give Gone Girl high marks--I found myself sympathizing with, then hating, then being afraid of various characters at every turn of the page (or so it felt). There is something intensely frightening about finding out that people you supposed were ordinary are actually anything but.<br /><br />This book preys on a lot of weird psychological twinges that seem to be fairly common. Most obviously, this book brings up the \\"how well do you really know your spouse?\\" argument over and over and over. Do you ever look at your spouse, partner, boyfriend, what-have-you and think how weird it is that this is a completely separate entity from you that you have decided to trust implicitly? Do you ever think how strange it is that shared experiences are the only thing that separates your partner from someone you pass in the street?<br /><br />This book pounces on those questions and takes it a step (or several steps) further. Gone Girl is really a psychological drama disguised as a murder/suspense novel and it doesn't give you any breathing room. The plot is so intense and the plot twists so unrelenting that I had to often stop reading and give myself ashort break to digest what I'd just read and realign my assumptions about the characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like with many good books (especially suspense/mystery novels), Flynn created a genius plot and then seemed to lack the vision of how to pull it all together at the end. While it's sometimes true that no ending can be perfectly satisfying to a reader, this one seems particularly forced--to the point of being overly abrupt. One could argue that she did this purposefully, but the usual \\"tricks\\" signalling the reason for an abrupt ending (a vague conclusion, the hint of some bigger turmoil to come, etc.) didn't materialize for me. After the breathless, frantic pace of the rest of the book, the last few pages left a bittersweet taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I'd hate to let that paragraph above be the final word for this review, so let me just say that you should absolutely read this. Maybe today. I haven't read a book like this in a long time...or ever. There are moments of complete brilliance--plot twists so smart and unexpected that you might gasp out loud. Some books don't deserve the hype surrounding them, especially during the summer publishing season. This one does. (But I'm still not sold on the ending.)
1250006341|5.0|This gorgeous book would be an excellent addition for anyone who is a fan of Downton Abbey, and would make a great gift. It is full of beautiful pictures and is printed on high quality thick paper. I would not recommend getting a kindle edition, as it would spoil the effect. These types of books need to be seen in all of their glory to be fully appreciated.<br /><br />There is a lot of interesting information about the making of the series, with looks behind the scenes, as well as interesting historical information that a lot of the series is based on. Any fan of Downton Abbey should be able to enjoy this book. I would highly recommend it!
0307592731|5.0|I know I'm reading a swath of great books when with each new book I've read, I pronounce that it's the Best Book I've Read All Year. In this case, I think it is and will remain so.<br /><br />After her mother's death, a divorce and a bout with heroin, 26-year-old Strayed decides (almost on a whim) to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, a massive route from Mexico to the Canadian border. The PCT becomes its own character in an emotional story that will simultaneously lift you up and crush you in waves. That's the thing about a great book, and especially about a great memoir: even if you have not had one similar experience to the author and know nothing personally about the specifics in her life, there is a thread of human connection--of hurt, love and loss--that will still speak to you and touch you in some way.<br /><br />Strayed's story is intense from start to finish. Obviously, the portions with Strayed on the PCT itself have elements of adventure and danger, but the quieter portions--moments in her failing marriage, vignettes along the bedside of her dying mother--are equally profound. There have been so many books over the past several years (arguably starting with the bestseller Eat, Pray, Love) that encourage excess, relaxation and, well, vacation in order to \\"find yourself.\\" I appreciated that Strayed's story is presenting a different narrative--one far away from the self-indulgence we as readers have become so accustomed to reading in memoirs. Yes, there may be some merit in healing losses with the balm of self-indulgence, and there may even be solace (though perhaps temporarily so), but I couldn't help but compare Strayed's journey to that of others in books I have read. In the end, I found Strayed's more genuine, more moving and--dare I say it--more authentic. By pushing herself to every limit and by physically removing herself from the problems in her life, she was able to think. In the silence of her own thoughts, with her blistered feet marking a slow cadence on the trail, she was able to discover the start of own path out of the mistakes and heartbreak that littered her past.<br /><br />I think the hardest part of moving past a tremendous loss or change is finding the will to just keep going. Often there is no trumpet chorus with the clouds opening up proclaiming that you have finally reached your ideal and enlightened self. There is no ashram and no tropical paradise that can hide the realities of your life once you return to it. \\"Making a fresh start\\" is impossible. As life unfolds one page at a time (to use a popular metaphor), what makes us want to rip out entire chapters? Those times will always be with us, but we do not have to live in them. We can just continue.<br /><br />I've perhaps never read a book that conveyed so poignantly every spectrum of human emotion in a mere 300 pages or so. I hope you'll give it a chance and see how Strayed's honest, beautiful memoir might move you as well.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This works great I don't have to remove my itouch case, I've used it on Bose sound dock, Ihome clock radio and a few other devices worked on all of them. Great product.
0345803485|1.0|I'm not quite sure where to start here. First, let me just confirm what you already know. Spoiler alert! The writing sucks. It sucks so hard that you almost can't believe it. I could feel my brain cells dying. And that's not the only reason the cells were dropping off like flies. It's also boring.    Second, let me just clue all of you in on a little secret. If you want to read about sex, people having sex, people enjoying sex, people having smutty sex, people having BDSM sex, THIS IS NOT YOUR ONLY OPTION. ([...])    I was discussing this book with a few friends last week and they said, \\"Yeah, it's terrible, but the sex scenes were so good!\\" So, what you're saying is that I should sit through hundreds of pages of an abusive relationship, shitty characters that I hated from page one and the most godawful writing I've read in years because it has SEX IN IT?    I'm sorry, but no. No. No. No. Good erotica exists. This is not it. This will NEVER be it. If you want sex scenes, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a love story, this is not it. If you're wanting an entertaining beach read, Andy Cohen wrote a good one.    You know what really pisses me off about this book? It's insulting, on top of which, it worked. Millions of women reading this thinking that BDSM sounds so glamorous, and oh, Ana has such an enviable life with her handsome abusive sex master, why can't I have that life?    Because that life would SUCK. Newsflash! You can have BDSM sex and be in a loving, caring relationship. Yep, that's a real thing. You don't need some pseudo-English accent speaking multimillionaire with mommy issues swooping down to control your life.    Basically, I'm just sick to death of reading books that play off the lowest common denominator in their blatant push to appeal to a female audience. Romance, sex, handsome guys? Sure, I'll take it all. But don't insult me in the process. Don't assume I have to imagine myself being utterly controlled to enjoy those things. I'll be the first to admit I read Twilight and found the series entertaining. I watch the movies too. Do I think that they contain some pretty shitty messages in general, but especially for women--young, impressionable women in particular? Yep. I definitely do. But, if you'll recall, in Twilight, Bella--while mostly a naive dolt--also makes a few decisions of her own. Maybe stupid ones sometimes, but at least she makes them of her own accord while everyone around her tries to convince her otherwise. Guess what Ana does? She'll limply protest Christian for a few mind-numbing paragraphs before she inevitably gives in, whether it's because he's ploying her with sex or money or emotional mind-games or whatever other currency she seems to value more than her own brain at that particular moment.    I know some people say, \\"Well, I don't take it seriously, but it's an entertaining book.\\" Bullshit. Insulting your intelligence with this book is not entertaining. Enjoying the blow-by-blow breakdown of getting sucked into an abusive relationship is not entertaining. But what about the sex, you say? Sex is entertaining, sure, so go have it yourself. Or read some quality erotica.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book has a lot of sex in it every three minutes it seems.  To me, it doesn't have a real good plot.  It just seems that they don't do anything except have sex.  Makes me awfully tired.

0345803485|1.0|Let's face it...it's not a well written novel, so the fact that it got published, must mean that it only did so because of the nasty sex in it.  The publishers knew the sex and the situation of the relationship would create a stir, thus create SALES.  And obviously, all the publishers care about are the SALES. What a sad day for the true art of literature.

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This lavish, entertaining fantasy adaptation of Grimms' fairy tale from first-time feature director Rupert Sanders is a huge upgrade from the frivolous Julia Roberts film \\"Mirror, Mirror.\\"<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is Snow in this dark, compelling version fashioned by writers Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. In their decidedly serious take on the subject, Snow's father is murdered by her new stepmother (Charlize Theron), who promptly imprisons his daughter until she's able to break free and seek refuge in the dark forest. Needing her back, alive, Theron's Queen sends a washed-up huntsman (\\"Thor\\"'s Chris Hemsworth) after her, though he questions her motivations -- as well as his own -- after he runs into the young heroine.<br /><br />Happily eschewing the CGI'd green-screen approach of so many other, recent genre films, \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" benefits enormously from its real-world UK location shooting. The film looks like an actual, lived-in environment, and its \\"realistic\\" visuals are matched by equally strong performances, especially from Theron (in one of her juiciest roles) and Hemsworth, who does some nice work in a scene with the cursed Snow late in the film. For her part, Stewart does as much with the character of Snow White as the script allows - I bought her in Snow's empathetic scenes with the natural world, but she doesn't really have much to do in comparison with the other leads. There are also the dwarves, here played by a collection of character actors CGI'd to smaller proportions (Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone among them), but the film doesn't do nearly enough with that concept as it should have.<br /><br />The plot itself is surprisingly rich and traditional - not in terms of it being a fairy tale, but rather an old-fashioned cinematic fantasy-adventure - and is backed by impressive cinematography, costumes, and a satisfying mix of character and action. Sanders draws you in and lets the film breathe, and while there are CGI beasts, the film's emotional draw is human - rather than technical - in nature, and ends on a particularly satisfying beat (with a robust James Newton Howard score). Even more satisfying than the likes of \\"Willow\\" and \\"Dragonslayer,\\" this \\"Snow White\\" is a surprisingly good \\"revisionist\\" take of the oft-told tale on nearly every level.<br /><br />Universal brings \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" to Blu-Ray on September 11th in a combo pack featuring both the theatrical version and a slightly extended, 132-minute unrated cut. Extra features are fairly light - just a few making Of featurettes and commentary are on-hand - but the transfer (1080p AVC) is terrific, as is the DTS MA audio. A DVD and digital copy (both Ultraviolet and standard itunes-variety) are also included.
0895260131|1.0|Very poor book.  I was trying to get a serious reading, however I this book is a waste of money. The autor seems to have as objective to create hae against Islam.

B005S9EK1S|4.0|BLU-RAY REVIEW: While I haven't been a big admirer of most of the films adapted from Nicholas Sparks books, there's just something appealing about \\"The Lucky One,\\" a well-made adaptation of one of Sparks' countless romantic tomes from \\"Shine\\" director Scott Hicks.<br /><br />Zac Efron is much better than anticipated here as a U.S. army vet, trying to readjust to life after three tours of duty in Iraq, who sets out to find his \\"guardian angel\\": a torn photograph of a lovely young blonde that he found in the rubble during combat. Efron's journey takes him to a gorgeous Louisiana seaside community (mistakenly listed as North Carolina on the disc's packaging) where the girl turns out to be a divorced mom (Taylor Schilling) trying to recuperate on her own from the death of her brother and her fractured relationship with an abrasive ex-husband (Jay R. Ferguson). The two forge an immediate relationship but her emotional issues and the presence of her ex threaten both of their futures.<br /><br />\\"The Lucky One\\" provides few surprises - this is basically a standard romantic drama not unlike any Hallmark Channel original movie - but what makes the film work is the overall quality of the filmmaking and its appealing performances. Efron and Schilling generate an awful lot of chemistry together here, and both provide likeable characterizations that make it easy for viewers to pull for them. What's more, Hicks' fine lensing - complete with color-drenched cinematography by Alar Kivilo - raises the material a notch above most of the prior Sparks films, while Mark Isham's truly superb score (sadly unreleased as of yet) adds a further emotional layer to the entire picture. Though no classic, as \\"date movies\\" and recent romantic dramas go, \\"The Lucky One\\" is one of the best I've seen in some time.<br /><br />Warner brings \\"The Lucky One\\" to Blu-Ray in the form of a combo pack also offering a DVD and Ultraviolet copy. Extra features are fairly lightweight here, comprised of three featuretes, while the disc technically is capped by a splendid 1080p transfer that really makes the visuals sing along with a 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack.
B005LAIH54|3.0|This picture has a suitable enough tale (especially if you ignore a few holes) but is something you see more for the special effects and archetypes.<br /><br />The \\"Big Three\\", Zeus (Lian Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), are trying to stop their father, Cronos, from coming out of captivity and basically taking over the world. It seems like an easy enough task but then Zeus is betrayed and the walls of Tarterus (which hold Cronos captive) begin to waver and monsters are unleashed. Wouldn't you know it but a two headed chimera shows up in Perseus' village. What were the possibilities? Maybe they're attracted to demigods just like in the \\"Percy Jackson\\" novels.<br /><br />Anyway, as the world begins to unravel Perseus is called up to be a hero again and he and some others seek out to find Hephaestus. Princess Andromeda, now a warrior woman, assists.<br /><br />What follows is predictable but again this is film you see for the special effects, not the story. Watch it for the battles and the mythological monsters.<br /><br />A third installment is planned and that shouldn't be a surprise since the budget was $150M and it made a bit over $300M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; SPECIAL EFFECTS/CGI: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid August 2012.
034580404X|1.0|I would say that this series is written weakly. While there is an occasional use of upper level vocabulary, it is so repetative that you get bored. Also, it feels as though the lead characters are sexual version of Edward and Bella Cullen mish mashed with The Story of O. I would not recommend these books to anyone other then deeply attention starved, uneducated house wives. I was bored to death!!! The only good thing about these books is the only good thing about any romantic comedy. The prissy little girl with low self esteem gets the \\"Mr Amazing\\"catch and is his exception to the rule. The characters are unrealistic and weak in character. However, If you want a quick, infantile read... By all means...
0061148512|5.0|When I first read this book about 15 years ago, I was expecting a downright depressing story of a young woman's descent into madness. Instead, I got an often hilarious telling of what it's like to be such a brilliant and insightful woman with a brain chemistry problem. Sometimes, I almost fell out of bed laughing at Esther's perceptions and reactions to her situation. True, certain parts are downright horrific and devastating; but I still felt that Slyvia Plath had created an \\"Essential\\" novel for everyone to read.

0811879542|5.0|I love how the book helps kids to learn to interact with the text.  The concept that pictures in the book have meaning and that such meaning is important is clearly communicated by this book's design.  My two-year old niece enjoys this book as it speaks to her natural inclination to understand the world and how it works.
0345802934|1.0|I wish I had read other reviews before purchasing this book.  I have not read Murakami before and will not again.  For those of us who like resolution--of the story and/or characters--this novel provides none!  Readers are not even given the novel about which this story revolves.  I have read many other novels, the plots of which were unpleasant or of little interest to me personally, because the author's use of language and/or descriptive material were so beautiful.  This book left me cold and unsatisfied.  I am disappointed that Mr. Murakami cannot resolve any part of a story in over 1100 pages.
B006B31B80|3.0|There has been a tremendous difference in the first six episodes of Season Two and the six episodes that comprised Season One. For Season One, the plot developed at a blistering pace along with the character development. There was never a dull moment and I literally could not put down the series from the second Episode One began until the final second of Season One. Unfortunately, that same calibre of writing has not persisted in Season Two, and I believe that is why some fans of the series feel disappointed.<br /><br />Yes, the timbre of the series remains: it is about zombies, our main characters are there, but the series is much slower paced. They have some episodes which have more action than others or that have a surprise ending. But I don't need to see 5 slower paced episodes with more filler dialog in order to see one episode with a surprise ending to make up for it. So far, not one of the episodes has equaled the calibre of the Season One episodes.<br /><br />I feel that AMC is cheating us as the viewers for presenting Season Two like this. I would rather have had six episodes in Season Two and have them be written tightly like Season One than have 13 episodes that are written like mostly filler episodes with a lot of nonessential dialog and scenes.<br /><br />Now for the episode itself.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />At the beginning, we see the doctor's wife feeding perfectly good chickens to the zombies in the barn. This is horrifying on three counts: One, she is feeding zombies. Two, in a world where food is scarce, she is wasting it on ... zombies. Three, everyone (except Glenn) is unaware she is feeding the zombies.<br /><br />Glenn can't keep a secret, so he tells Dale there are zombies in the barn and Lori is pregnant. Dale confronts the doctor (Hershel) about the zombies, and Hershel says they are real people and he isn't going to kill the zombies in the barn. Hershel doesn't want Dale to tell anyone else, including Rick.<br /><br />The group is learning to shoot. (I am wondering why they are using so much ammunition on target practice! I thought they only had limited rounds.) Rick knows the group needs to be moving on soon as Hershel has said now that Carl has healed, it is time for them to move on. No word on if they are continuing to look for Sophia. Lori is devastated when she hears the news that the group needs to be moving on. She wants Rick to ask Hershel to let them stay on. Rick says the best thing to do right now is to give Hershel some space.<br /><br />Shane is teaching Andrea to shoot and is being a jerk. He gets Andrea rattled enough that she stops shooting and leaves the practice area. He tracks her down and apologizes. He then says he has a lead on Sophia and asks if she will help him check it out. She agrees to help him.<br /><br />Meanwhile Glenn and Maggie go into town to get some supplies for pregnant Lori, who still hasn't told anyone including her husband that she is pregnant. Maggie gets attacked by a zombie and Glenn has to kill it. Glenn asks if Maggie was scratched and we as the audience are not sure. Maggie is glad he killed the zombie, even though she feels conflicted as she doesn't think any of the zombies in the barn should be killed. When they return to camp Maggie makes a scene in front of Lori about almost getting them killed and tells Lori to get her own supplies. Maggie throws the supplies at Lori's feet. Among them are a morning after pill.<br /><br />Shane and Andrea are in a suburban neighborhood exploring a house looking for Sophia. It turns out to be a dead end. Andrea says to Shane, \\"She never was here, was she?\\" While they are looking, a lot of zombies suddenly appear outside the house and begin to attack. Shane and Andrea have to fight them off with gunfire, but Andrea's gun jams. As she tries to clear the jam, a zombie gets very close to her. There is some question whether Shane is going to protect her. Once Andrea clears the jam, she is remarkably cool under pressure. They get safely into the car. Andrea has no fear of zombies and is a great shot thanks to Shane's great coaching. He is a crappy person but apparently a great gun coach.<br /><br />Andrea gets sexually excited by the andrenaline rush of killing the zombies and makes a move on Shane as he is driving down the road. If she only knew what a monster he was ... right? When they get back to camp, Dale is suspicious because both of them are acting ... funny. He confronts Shane about Andrea, and suggests Shane should follow through on leaving the camp. Dale also asks Shane outright what happened that night with Shane and the hunter at the high school and says Shane has been vague and hasn't given any real answers about what went down. Shane says Dale, Rick and Lori should be grateful; that because of him, Carl is alive.<br /><br />Lori takes all three packets of morning after pills in a moment of spontaneity, then wishes she hadn't. She runs through the woods, sticks her hand down her throat, and vomits them up.<br /><br />The confrontation between Dale and Shane continues. Dale says he knows what kind of a man Shane is. He says he wasn't there that night at the high school. But he was there when Shane had Rick in his gun sights and he held him there. He held him there, not letting him go. Like he wanted to shoot him. Shane looks for a split second like a cornered animal. But the right words come out of his mouth, even though he looks insane as he says them: he says that Rick is best friend. Then he threatens Dale and says he doesn't even like Dale; and gives the impression he may come after him since Dale is throwing accusations at Shane.<br /><br />Rick finds the empty morning after pill packets. He finds Lori. He confronts Lori about not telling him about the pregnancy, but at least she has vomited up the pills. Lori also tells Rick about her and Shane. Rick has already known or suspected.<br /><br />This episode contains a lot of material that continues to round out our characters, but it wasn't an earth-shattering episode. If I have to compare it to the episodes in Season One, it doesn't come close. I continue to care very much what happens to these characters, but I'd rather have Season Two in six short, compelling episodes than wasting the audience's time with filler.
B004890KJK|5.0|You will never go wrong with buy her books especially the \\"\\"Kay Scarpetta\\"\\" series. This is great book and I would recommend any and ALL her books to family, friends, book lovers. I specifically look for her new books to come out. I love her writing style and the fact that she thoroughly researches her information even though they are works of fiction to have the accurate information about what, when, and where she is writing about.
B006FE17Q6|4.0|Even though the writing is not what it was in Season One -- and Season One has creator Frank Darabont to thank, as he wrote or had a hand in writing four of the six episodes -- we still have a great ensemble cast and the bones of a great series. Now all we need are good writers to -- pardon the pun -- flesh out the story. They did this so skillfully in Season One that watching it was so effortless, we could hardly wait for the next episode. Now we have an entire new cast of writers, none of them from Season One, and the series has suffered as a result.<br /><br />Onto the recap:<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Glenn, with Dale's encouragement, tells the group about the zombies in the barn. The group is outraged and divided: Shane immediately talks about leaving, whereas Rick wants to approach Hershel about clearing out the barn, as Rick wants to stay because Lori is pregnant. Carol is not ready to leave as she wants to look for Sophia, as do many of the group. Shane is trying to convince them that there is no reason to keep looking for Sophia as in his opinion, all hope is lost of finding her alive. Shane and Daryl almost get into a brawl as Rick pulls them apart. It is always ironic to me to see a police cap on Shane's head.<br /><br />Rick pleads with Hershel to let the group stay, but his words fall on deaf ears. Hershel wants the group gone from his land by the end of the week. Rick says they found the barn with the zombies inside. That they can help to clear the barn: that the zombies aren't people. He tries to tell Hershel if Hershel makes them leave, he is sentencing them to death. He tells Hershel that his wife is pregnant: that it is a blessing if they stay on the farm, but it is a curse if they are sent back out into the world. Hershel refuses to listen.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Shane has set up a security detail on the barn in case any of the zombies escape. He did so without consulting Rick. Rick is considered the leader of the group.<br /><br />Rick finds Shane and tells Shane that he is \\"negotiating\\" with Hershel. Shane overreacts and says they need their guns immediately or they need to leave. Rick finally tells him Lori is pregnant and that leaving is not an option. Shane immediately reiterates they need their guns. Rick says guns aren't an option. Watching Shane, we can see he is just not all there, not entirely sane. Also that he'd do anything for Lori. Which makes me wonder what is coming next ...<br /><br />Shane approaches Lori and gives her this Stalker Speech about all the reasons he is a better partner for her than Rick, and why Rick is not meant to survive in this world. We can see that in every way he views Rick as a threat. It is chilling. By his words, we can see he wants to take Lori and Chad away from Rick, or perhaps have some harm befall Rick. Would he murder Rick in order to get what he wants?<br /><br />Shane goes to get guns from the RV -- perhaps to murder the zombies in the barn -- and finds out Dale has hidden them. He is livid.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hershel has taken Rick on an errand: to rescue two zombies who are trapped in a swamp near the house. Hershel asks Rick how many he has killed, and Rick replies, \\"Too many to count.\\" Hershel tells Rick, it doesn't matter how you have seen them in the past, if you want to stay on my land, you have to treat them as human beings. \\"My farm, my barn, my say,\\" he says to Rick as he hands him a tool to capture a zombie.<br /><br />Dale attempts to hide the guns from Shane in the swamp but Shane finds them. Dale threatens to kill Shane to prevent Shane from taking them, but Dale, nice guy that he is, cannot bring himself to do so.<br /><br />Shane hands out guns to the group and riles them all up, saying they need to clear out the zombies from the barn. Rick is not there to say no. Meanwhile, Rick emerges from the woods with a live zombie along with Hershel with another live zombie. This riles up the group with the guns, with Shane as their leader, and before you know it, it turns into a mob scene. They gather where Rick is, and the scene is just waiting for a match to light it.<br /><br />Shane is the match. He begins to talk hate speech about zombies. He shoots one of them in the head, the one Hershel is leading. Then he takes the padlocks off the barn doors and lets the zombies go. Everyone in the group except for Rick, his wife Lori, his son Chad, and Dale begin to shoot the zombies until all of them are dead. Hershel, on his knees, looks shocked, like his family has been massacred.<br /><br />A lone figure emerges from the barn. It is Sophia. She is a zombie. The entire group looks shocked. No one makes a move to shoot her. She continues to make her way toward them unimpeded. Rick is the one who finally steps up and puts her out of her misery. Daryl holds Carol back as she tries to run to her daughter.<br /><br />The ending of this episode was very powerful. Another surprise twist - an unexpected ending. I do like these types of endings. Now if they could just speed up the overall pace of the storytelling and dialogue to match Season One's.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This may not be the best performing CPU coolers, but once you get past this the law of diminishing returns feels very obvious. This runs my old i5-750 2C warmer than a cooler that is $50 more expensive, and keeps my overclocked i5-3570k nice and cool at 4.6Ghz.
B0067H9W72|4.0|*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />This episode starts with another skillful use of a flashback, this time with the group stuck on the freeway back when Rick was still in the hospital in the early days, before they knew anything was wrong with Atlanta, as they watched in horror as the military napalmed the streets.<br /><br />Lori realizes she is pregnant and doesn't know what to do with the information, and we learn that Daryl has seen a chupacabra on a previous squirrel hunting trip. Some in the group laugh at this, but clearly Daryl doesn't think this is funny and reminds the group that there are ZOMBIES around, so why is a chupacabra so far-fetched? Glenn continues to pursue the doctor's daughter, whom he has had sex with once in the pharmacy.<br /><br />The group fans out in search of Sophia. Shane tells Rick in no uncertain terms that searching for Sophia is a waste of time and is dragging the rest of the group down, weakening them. Shane thinks they should call off the search. Rick is clearly in disagreement by his friend's opinion and at the same time begins to question himself. They argue, but they keep looking.<br /><br />Daryl is looking for Sophia too, and shoots a squirrel while doing so. He finds Sophia's doll. Then a rattlesnake spooks his horse, he falls off and down an embankment and ends up with an arrow embedded through him and all of his weapons gone. He is all alone with no help and surrounded by a steep embankment in the middle of a river. He makes a makeshift tourniquet to try to stop the bleeding. He hears something rustling in the bushes. He manages to fish out his crossbow from the deep waters, but doesn't recover his arrows. The only arrow he has is the one embedded through him.<br /><br />Daryl tries to crawl up the embankment, but falls again. Meanwhile back at camp, the doctor has discovered Daryl took his horse without asking. Daryl is now lying unconscious at the bottom of the embankment where a vision of Merle taunting him pays him a visit, plus a couple of zombies Daryl has to fight off. Daryl manages to pull the arrow out of his flesh -- painful! -- and shoots one of the zombies. But it is clear he doesn't have the strength to save himself and he will die out there. Merle's visit seems to have lit a fire under Daryl. He uses Sophia's doll as a torniquet. He eats the squirrel raw to get strength. Then he tries again to climb the embankment.<br /><br />When he begins to fail, Merle again visits him and goads him relentlessly. Eventually Daryl struggles up the embankment and makes it to the top. It is still a long way back to the farm house. He is in the middle of the woods, injured.<br /><br />Daryl finally makes it back to camp but Andrea, who is on lookout with a sniper rifle, shoots him, mistaking him for a zombie as he ambles into camp. Luckily she is a very bad aim!<br /><br />In this episode we see what has become obvious to those of us watching the series: Daryl is not such a bad guy after all. He is in fact a hero of sorts. And Shane is the real bad guy in their midst. Shane is the one who wants to call off the search for Sophia whereas Daryl wants to continue it. Even though Daryl had Merle as a brother, Daryl is okay.<br /><br />We can also see the doctor is becoming more and more uncomfortable with the presence of this group on his land as each day goes by. And then we finally see why: Glenn discovers a horrible secret in a barn: zombies. Locked inside.<br /><br />As for the pace of this episode, it continues to be rather slow or medium-paced, unlike the fast-paced episodes of the first season. A couple of episodes, like this one, have a surprise twist ending. But the episodes themselves are rather slow-paced. It is clear from the first season that the writers are capable of maintaining a super fast plot development, and we are not seeing that in Season Two so far.
081297381X|1.0|For me it was really difficult to finish this book. It's saying too little in too many words and what it is saying would in one sentence be that the author is the smartest living person while everybody else is an idiot. Without the arrogance and attempts being a 'philosopher' the book would have just few pages and hardly anything would be new.<br />Also there are argumentation flaws everywhere, straw man is particularly popular - \\"statisticians are stupid because they believe every random variable has normal distribution...\\"<br />The author is extremely cynical so few places are quite amusing, but for anything else than (diluted) entertainment the book is useless.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great books, not well written but fun. Easy to get lost in the story.  If you have issues with the first book, keep reading they get better!!!!
B0012NVGHU|3.0|If you'd like to see how ONCE evolved into today's hit musical, this is the movie for you. Same song's with the original movie cast and since it's a movie there's more of a REAL feel to it too.
0060531053|4.0|Excelente brewing book, the amount of information is fantastic and cover all the steps of the brewing process.<br />In the other hand, the paper quality is really poor so, if you intend to read, re-read and use this book a lot of times, definitely it will have a short life.
B002NXSRW0|5.0|I myself found this movie to be totally bad ass.  Forget anything you've heard and try this our for yourself.  I grew up playing with G.I.Joes, watching the cartoons and reading the Marvel (Larry Hama) stories.  There are a few things that could have been done differently in order to follow the original storyline better but I didn't mind.  I was just happy to get a Joe movie that was packed with classic characters and tons of action and spectacular special effects. Give it a try.  I loved it and give this movie the highest possible rating.

B008FTAAG2|5.0|I only heard them recently on Octane with their single Blood. Song kept growing on me and decided to look them up. Their older stuff was ok for me but this album really rocks. Their isn't a song I dislike (which doesn't happen to much). I had no expectations when buying this and was pleasantly surprised with every song.

B00439MV42|4.0|Great movie to watch with the family. We have all three of the Back to the Future movies and this one is a good ending to the first two movies.
B0034G4P26|5.0|The movie pulls a lot of it's plot from the first, second, and forth book from Gideon Defoe's 'The Pirates!' series. I still find the books more enjoyable but the movie is a great addition to the Pirates! family. Not a big fan of the name change for the North America audience though. The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists sounds much better than The Pirates! Band of Misfits in my opinion.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|The special effects were excellent and that is why I gave it 2 stars, however, the scenario was completely unbelievable.<br /><br />1. Burglarize a convenience store, get tazed by the cops for running from the scene...<br />2. then, at the request of your brother <who just happens to be a Ship's Commanding Office> become a twice promoted naval officer...with a felony burglary on his record.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention the reason he broke into the Convenience Store?? He met a pretty girl in a bar who wanted a chicken burrito...Oh, I almost forgot, her Daddy just happened to be a 3 star Admiral.<br /><br />I have seen better plots in a Saturday morning cartoon.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm not sure why this book has received so much hype.  It starts out well enough, but about midway through, it began to drag and I was anticipating the end.  Amazon keeps making recommendations to me based on books that are similar, but I'm afraid they have fallen on deaf ears.  Maybe I'm just outside the demographic for this book.
B004GYY714|5.0|Downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire and I am really pleased so far.  It was easy to download and install and searching for music was a breeze.  Works great with the Fire.  Know I'm going to be using this one a lot.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I don't usually download freebies or give an opinion but I like this quite a bit! Does precisely as described.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|Margaret is a remarkable and moving film, presenting a number of themes and plots, and using a complexity of methods to tell its story.  All kinds of performing arts are drawn on--theater, drama, poetry, opera, and music--as we follow the main character, played by Anna Paquin, through a series of emotional, complex, and always interesting relationships with her parents, friends, and others, following the film's opening, a bus accident that has to be the most wrenching five minutes I have ever seen on screen.  Paquin's character is on screen almost the entire film, in a remarkable performance that portrays an intelligent young person as at times immature/whining and at times mature/sensitive, often at the same time.  In addition to the opening scene, there are any number of memorable scenes and performances, most especially between Paquin and her teachers, her mother, the bus driver, and, most especially, the close friend of the victim.  Aside from everything else, the film captures an essence of New York street life, as random conversations are overheard and mingle with the story lines, to great effect.  Also memorable are several scenes of strident classroom political arguments, and also every scene involving Jean Reno, as Paquin's mother's new suitor.  At the center of the film is a scene where a teacher played by Matthew Broderick reads aloud the Hopkins poem which gives the film its name (\\"Margaret are you grieving...\\").<br />Even at its relatively high price, I recommend the two-disc set.  This contains the lengthy theatrical release (150 mins.) on Bluray, plus a second disc containing the longer director's cut (180 mins.) on DVD.  I have watched both versions and found them both very moving.  The theatrical release truncates some of the plot points, and for that reason I prefer the longer version.  But, conversely, there is a sense in which the theatrical version gains some urgency as it nears its conclusion, and therefore both versions are worth watching.<br/>As a final note, I will mention that a couple of key scenes take place during opera performances, and both scenes use extensive excerpts from their arias, showing great sensitivity to the power of music.

B0063IH60K|4.0|a good game of solitaire with no special theme. ads are annoying, but it keeps the game free and they are skipable.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it is okay but not addictive like some games. I would much rather play scramble or something like that. got it?
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The Winchester brothers seem like members of my family, I cry for and with them. The show is about a family that happens to hunt things that go bump in the night.  I admit there have been some eps that are not high on my like list, but even the worst ones are usually better than anything else on TV.<br /><br />Just pre-ordered season 7, have watched 1-6 on DVD more times than I even remember, even season 7 has been watched many times, love DVRs.<br /><br />As much as I loved the first 3 seasons, with the introduction of Angel Castiel in season 4 the series got even better.  I loved the Demon & Angel arc and the bonus material is worth the price of the disk.
0553386794|3.0|I have been reading fantasy for a while although, honestly most of it was the Wheel of Time series, then I moved on to read almost all of Brandon Sanderson's stuff and a few Sci-Fi books.<br /><br />I just don't understand why everyone loves this series. I'm currently halfway through \\"A Clash of Kings\\" and am still only moderately interested. I could easily put this series down and pick up something else that actually makes me want to keep reading without any remorse.  However, I will finish reading it because I don't like to leave things unfinished.<br /><br />What's good?<br />The writing is great and the character development is fantastic! Thank goodness for The Wall, at least that part of the series is often interesting.<br /><br />What's bad?<br />The story has almost no hook at all for me. I'm frequently bored.  There is very little \\"fantasy\\" to this fantasy series and what there is gets dragged out to the point where you just don't care anymore.  The one interesting fantasy element to this book was so obvious and played out that I was just waiting for it to happen (I'm sure everyone was)...who cares. There is never any hope that anyone will ever rise above or that anything will make you feel triumphant while reading.<br /><br />Most will say that this is High Fantasy and that's how it is supposed to be, which is probably true. However, for me it reads like a slow gruesome soap opera, and can often be just as boring as them. I guess it all depends on what you find interesting.<br /><br />EDIT...<br />So I lied about finishing the book. I stopped reading towards the end of book 2. It wasn't really a conscious decision, I just stopped picking it up and realized a week or two later that I just don't care what happens. I will say that the HBO series is much more interesting than the books so I guess I'll finish the story that way.
0385341008|5.0|An amazing novel written in letter format, this is the very first book I've read on Kindle.  I enjoyed the book so much, that I bought a paper copy for my mom.  Eloquently written, this story of healing after WWII is a delight to read.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is an amazing mind boggling game. It gets it right 99.9% of the time!!!! Its absolute craziness! It can guess every famous person or cartoon out there. Its too bad no one knows about this game though...it would definitely be a hit.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|this knife is awesome. the handle is comfortable, the sheath fits the knife perfect. My only complaints about it are the edge was inconsistent and I had to re-profile it to make it even on both sides, the black finish had some imperfections in it, and the sheath belt loop is floppy when worn on belt. Now those complaints aren't a big deal. I would have preferred a better factory edge profile but for 50 bucks you cannot complain. I must say this though... After repairing the edge this knife is insanely sharp. Hair popping sharp. I dragged it over a hair spot on my leg and with absolutely no snags this knife glided over taking every hair it touched. I am very impressed with the quality of the steel. I would recommend to anyone wanting a utility/survival knife at low cost. Not many knife makers in the under $150 dollar range can touch this.

I'm not as happy as I'd like to be.
0307948110|1.0|Underdeveloped characters, terrible plot, and awful ending.. Stay far, far away..!! The Ghost was pretty good, but this just proves the author completely clueless regarding both technology and trading.. Fortunately, I didn't waste more than a few bucks on this and you should save yours..!!

B000VM9Z8K|3.0|I've always enjoyed Sophie Kinsella's books but this book lacked the humor and suspense of her previous books.  Easy read but  forgettable, I hope her next book is as good as 20's Girl or Cofessions of a Shopaholic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great read this book turned out to be.  My doctor told me about this book and gave it a big thumbs up so of course, I ran out and bought it.  A real page-turner and well written tale of a husband and wife and their life after job loss, relocation, and a discovered affair.  This story is so well written and the characters are so flawed, it's hard to know who to feel sorry for-- Nick (the cheating husband) or Amy (the abducted wife).  Won't give anything away...you must read this!
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|Was not sure what to think at the beginning but I have to say this was very well done and thought production values were high and the script and dialogue we very good as well. Sure there are some disturbing parts but it is a horror type film.<br /><br />It is without a doubt one of the best in genre.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Having heard the hype surrounding these books, bit the buillet and dowloaded them!  Fun read, just posh porn in first book, the second and third did develop into a story, albeit a light, quick read.  Total chick flick stuff, good summer read in the sun.

0345536886|4.0|The Litigators is an enjoyable read by Grisham.  In this book, he carries through to the end and provides a satisfactory conclusion to the story.  The novel introduces readers to several entertaining characters and some interesting drama inside and outside the courtroom. Although I don't consider The Litigators a thriller or gripping page-turner, it is entertaining and fits the bill nicely for a summer read.

B0056BMK6K|1.0|I'd give this ZERO stars if I could. A New York Times expose on a service that's now defunct that used to recruit paid reviewers for authors admitted Locke was a client who spent over a thousand dollars on hundreds of Amazon reviews so that he could get rich on all of this. He's the \\"biggest\\" seller in the indie market, the most famous one, I guess, and he's just a fraud. Funny how in his books he did't mention that he bought reviews and ____ was where to buy them too. Sham, sham, sham!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Rarely is there a book that so effortlessly allows you to feel every spectrum of emotion.  You will have tears of laughter, heartbreak and loss.  A wonderful book with characters and  stories that will stay with you for weeks after the last page.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|After finishing The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo trilogy, I was desperate for a book that would take me through the summer without interruption.  A Game of Thrones - 4-Book Bundle satisfied that need.  The books are more entertaining than the TV series. This was a great down load and a must-read for those who love fantasy.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Like my title says. This is simply one of the best books I have ever read.I was introduced to the book by a co-worker and I was apprehensive at first, but after I read the sample from my Kindle Fire I was hooked. Normally I don't read a book unless it catches me within the first 3-5 pages, but this one had me in by the second page. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone and everyone. This is a good book not just for kids but adults as well. All ages can read this book. I can't wait to read some more from this author!!!!!

0790749815|5.0|What can I say! One of the BEST Hitchcock ever directed, an all star cast, a thrilling plot, action packed sequences til the very end, and a \\"dreamy\\" love story with Cary Grant!! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Sometimes I re-watch it just to see the comedy scenes with Cary drunk, the aftermath with the police, and his hilarious scenes with his mother!!( in the very beginning with his mistaken identity!!)
B0002WZTOI|5.0|It's still hard for me to believe that Tony Scott is no longer with us. \\"Top Gun\\" was his break-out hit. It also launched the careers of many young actors. It's nice to see the film again on DVD. I wonder if there will be a sequel now?
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|There's a lot to say about this game.<br /><br />I've played this game on the iPad so when I saw it on the kindle fire, I installed it right away. It's much nicer on the kindle fire because of its horizontal, so I've been able to enjoy it more on the kindle fire.<br /><br />In the game, you collect coins to buy gadgets, jetpacks, utilities, clothes, and vehicle ugrades from the stash, try to accomplish missions, and try to get as far as possible. For me, though, I have to play a lot of games to buy something.<br /><br />I really like the concept of restarting the missions and getting paid for it without taking away what you purchased. It restarts the fun without restarting everything. Another cool thing of this game. It keeps you playing for a long time.<br /><br />Overall, you should get this game. It's free and the in-app purchases are not really necessary (unless you want to take the fun out of everything).

B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book makes you do some soul searching. Morrie's insight of others is something we all need to work on. I didn't want the book to end, I just wanted to learn more and more. I know I look at people many times and come up with my impression of them, never getting to know them to find out who they are. I plan to work on that and hope that I become half the man Morrie was and God wants me to be. I am praying!
B000R7GKQE|4.0|The only reason I rate these 4 stars because I bought these DVDs and received a set coded for Region 2 (Europe) I was not able to play on any device but my computer and was only able to do that by changing the settings in my video watching software to read Region 2 instead of Region 1 (USA) other than that the DVDs were great.  This is disappointing but works just fine as I planned on watching them using my computer anyway.  If anyone receives this product and cannot get them to play on normal DVD players or other devices, check the back of the box and look for a small globe with a number in it.  If the number is anything but 1, then you have a different region code and must do what I did or return them.  Otherwise, great show and great product.
0385338724|5.0|No spoiler.  This was my first book by this author and one of my favorites of all the books I have read which is a lot.  I really enjoyed the way the story went, how it was developed, how the characters were developed, the descriptions of everything and just the meaning behind the story.  I highly recommend this book and cannot wait to read more of hers. It was about 290 ebook pages and I read this book so fast because I just really enjoyed it so much and wanted to get back to the story.

B005C0DHEY|5.0|This isn't a film most of us would expect to see. In fact, there are many people who'd rather not know or who would refute it's content vehemently. The idea that we would essentially destroy our water sources for profit is incomprehensible - the kind of thing reserved for only the most foolhardy among us. Couldn't happen, right? This work documents exactly what happens when greed is permitted to override the greater good.  It's a \\"must see\\" for anyone old enough to know better.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|We still don't know where the author is going with the story-- either it's very obvious, or we'll end with some terribly nihilistic outlook. In any case, this installment doesn't advance the story arc and re-hashes old information. Readers could skip this book (save for a twist in the final chapters) and not miss much.

B006GLM5EQ|5.0|This series is truly additive. It leaves you hanging and desiring more at the end of each episode. I enjoyed how the created or writers have identified Vampires weakness and strengths. If you haven't seen the first season it is well worth the money if you enjoy vampires cliff hangers. This season was an excellent series to follow to watch and enjoy. If you don't mind nudity and foul language this is a excellent series to purchase.
B001EBV0NU|4.0|What do you expect from a sci-fi movie with the word \\"Attacts\\" in the title? It's another Martian bashing. This time it's got Tim Burton's imprint. With eight other planets in our solar system I often wonder why Hollywood loves to pick on a planet named after the Roman god of war. An all star cast led by Jack Nicholson, playing two roles, makes this rather campy movie worth watching. It may seem that the likes of Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Glenn Close and Annette Benning must have agreed to a pay cut just to act absolutely silly in this flick. The Martians appear invincible as they romp, stomp and pillage with abandon. Even the entire legislative branch of the U.S. government is obliterated. Nothing is sacred to these oversized megabrained invaders. Not even the White House presidential bedroom.  As the POTUS, Jack Nicholson at times transforms himself into a Nixon like figure in speech and mannerisms. He has to be nearly comatose to agree to using  nuclear weapons against the Martians. As a Las Vegas hotel tycoon wannabe, Nicholson morphs into a Burt Reynolds character complete with dark glasses, mustache and cowboy hat. How many times must the earthlings get fooled into believing the Martians are sincere and friendly? And while these aliens are not cannibals, their experimentation with selected humans go to outrageous lengths. Watch what happens to Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker. And what about that Martian dialect?  Their verbal communication sounds so much like a convention of AFLAC ducks. In the end it was a high decibel broadcast of a a song popularized by Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald - \\"Indian Love Call\\" that wipes them out like a 16th century bubonic plague.  Now, if you really want to see a movie that digs deep into the Martian psyche, what they are like and what they really think of earth people, it pays to check out Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\". It's nearly 5 hours long but still worth watching.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Best \\"kung fu action\\" type film I've seen in years - if not ever..<br /><br />IP Man is a great story with some great action - if you liked those kung fu action movies of the past or ever stuff like kill bill (although this movie isn't bloody), I think you'll love this one. I have yet to recommend this to anyone and have them say it's not frikkin awesome.

1451608659|1.0|Pro: Interesting story and I applaude her for exposing painful details of her childhood and gymnastics career.<br /><br />Cons: Poorly written and repetitive. I felt like I was reading her diary entries from junior high.<br /><br />This would probably be an appealing read for a teenage girl because the story is somewhat interesting, but the writing style made it hard for me to even finish. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs just to get through the chapter.

B0084IG8TM|3.0|I'll admit I was prompted to watch The Hunger Games because of the hype generated mostly by my daughter. She read the book, I didn't. The movie has high and low moments. There are some scenes that play out with nail biting interest that top many an adult oriented action flick. The low point scenes like an assailant that has to talk to Katness before killing her (typical chance to be saved)and weak CGI beasts that would have killed the duo hurt the film and push it into kid land from an adult perspective.<br /><br />The elaborate look of the film reaches grand moments along with some top notch survival acts. I do see where the appeal lies for the youth and I also see as an adult a little too much tv series style angst. Keeping the target audience in mind, it's an entertaining film. Watching the extras I was informed that Suzzane Collins who authored the book supposedly based the storyline of the ultra rich against the ultra poor on the Bush era worldview. I would say the class warfare interjection concept could be easily applied to the current White House occupant as well.<br /><br />The extras were also geared surprisingly towards adult viewing which I enjoyed. Donald Sutherland excelled with another creepy authoritative role and Woody Harelson was better than he has been with a realistic mixed bag persona. Jennifer Lawrence held the film together with appropriate emotions that made you want her to exceed.<br /><br />Josh Hutcherson as the boyfriend with a crush was a \\"seen it done before\\" portrayal. A few sub characters needed to brush up on the acting chops as well. All said and done, The Hunger Games mostly succeeds, you can watch it with the kids and end up with a discussion on the perils of life.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This is a good book so far. It's been several weeks since I started it and I'm only on like chapter 5 because I usually decide to do something other than read when I have time to read, but it's pretty solid so far.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I've watched this several times over and introduced many a friend to it. Kung Fu Hustle is hilarious! If you don't mind subtitles.<br />Just give it a chance - I have a feeling if you have any sense of humor - this is a movie you will enjoy! If you don't like comedy or laughter - stay away from this title.
B007LYB0PC|4.0|If there is one thing Jack White could never be accused of, it's lacking being prolific. Within the last decade, he has been the frontman for the duo The White Stripes as well as the Racontuers. He also played the backseat role of a musician in the band The Dead Weather. As if that wasn't enough, he served as a producer for albums by The Von Bondies as well as legendary country singer Loretta Lynn. He also recorded songs with artists from very diverse fields, such as R&B (Alicia Keys), country music (Wanda Jackson) and hip hop (Black Milk). For as much as he worked with many people, the very idea of recording a solo album remained elusive to White. That is until 2012, where he released his formal debut \\"Blunderbuss\\"- an album he almost solely wrote and produced. While it's a noticeably restrained effort in terms of sound, deep down inside it's still the same old Jack.<br /><br />Joining him on \\"Blunderbuss\\" is an all-star line up of session musicians- including Daru Jones, Pokey LaFarge and Fats Kaplin. Also appearing on the album is the trio of background singers comprised of his wife Karen Elson, Laura Matula and Ghanian singer Ruby Amanfu. Jack's album is what one would consider to be equally inspired by garage rock as he is by country music. Leading the album off is the Fender Rhodes heavy \\"Missing Pieces\\" in which he sings of a mysterious woman who captures his heart. On the hard rocker \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" he pines for the love of a girl despite her lack of fidelity. Jack sings of a manipulative girlfriend on \\"Freedom At 21\\" and refuses to get hurt or used again on \\"Love Interruption\\". He calls out a lover's behavior on the piano driven \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\". Jack does a cover of the 1960's hit \\"I'm Shakin'\\", which was originally performed by the late Little Willie John. He sets a man straight over a woman on \\"Trash Tongue Talker\\" and decides to avoid confrontation on \\"I Guess I Should Go To Sleep\\". He closes the album with the jazzy turned classic rock feel on \\"Take Me With You When You Go\\", a song that has a rhythmic shuffle that's reminiscent of Dave Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\". Overall, Jack White's \\"Blunderbuss\\" is great yet brief debut album from the Detroit turned Nashville musician. While it's a well produced album, lyrically the album could have been better. Still in all, it's one of the great rock albums from this year.ake Me With You When You Go\\", a song that has a rhythmic shuffle that's reminiscent of Dave Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\".

B003VWU2WA|2.0|This thing might be great for specific people who like to customize it but I had hoped that by default it would act as a HID media device.  That way I could use it without installing specific software since it would just pretend to be multimedia keys on a keyboard.  But sadly no, you *must* install the companies rather buggy software to make it do anything and the software must be running, you can't just configure it and then close the software.  Which means for my use as a volume nob for a tucked away system it won't work.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Watched this last night, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Still, it's not a five star movie for me. I thought the characters could have been fleshed out a little more. I am a little confused as to how these games control the population, or why the districts rebelled in the first place, etc, but maybe it spells it out in the book? YA isn't usually my thing, but I might have to go read these ones. :)

0805095535|5.0|Paul Auster is a hero among readers of his works, actually a hero among contemporary writers in general as is book always both challenge and entertain the reader, and finishing one of this books offers that rare sensation that you have been through an important experience. In WINTER JOURNAL Auster is in a reflective mood and while many of the great writers have offered a review of their lives, their works, their development as an artist and their finally coming to grips with the fact that age is marching toward death, Auster elects to place the reader in his shoes, feel the realities as he views them and the result is far more than a memoir or a reflection on his philosophy than a conversation with one of the great men of letters.<br /><br />Auster's gifts as a writer of creative impulses are present throughout this rather short book. He epiphany that he is aging is written with a darkly comedic range: 'Until no, no X-ray has revealed any damage to your lungs, no blood test has revealed any devastation to your liver, and so you forge on with your vile habits knowing full well that they will ultimately do you harm.'  He discusses the aging body with remarkable acuity, taking the reader into the space and times of his life that formed his character and his talent and these stories of his past, while at times bordering on the self-indulgent sharing of information we could do without, he seems in the course of his writing to recognize that history while important is not the topic at hand: 'Perhaps it is just as well to put aside your stories for now and try to examine what it felt like to live inside this body form the first day you can remember being alive until this one.'<br /><br />For those who are approaching the years of aging this book will be at once comforting and challenging.  Auster is unafraid to elicit visceral responses from his reader - 'This body is a catalogue of sensory data.  What one might call a phenomenology of breathing.' He is unafraid to undress and display his own scars from life, scars often self-induced by habits and indulgences that threaten this time in this life. But again in reference to his honoring of memory as an aspect of our daily mental exercises he reminds us that the corporal changes that occur with the passage of time or the origin of our ability to continue on with the life we have left. And for Auster and his career with words he summarizes `Writing begins in the body, it is the music of the body.'  The journey in which he accompanies us allows us to see as we perhaps have not viewed the world before, and traveling with Paul Auster as a companion is always a pleasure.

B0083SBMBM|4.0|This one Hollywood has planned a long time to make.  It has a big budget, great special effects.  The graphics are brilliant. I am sure that it must have cost a lot of money to make it.<br /><br />Surprisingly, to me, the story is quite passable. Some Norse god is trying to steal a great power source, the Avengers band together to save the Earth and the Universe.<br /><br />The acting is of a high quality. The characters interesting, I particularly like the Hulk. I thought the graphics to make him real were extremely good.<br /><br />The action is good. It will keep both, you and the kids entertained.

B005LAIH9A|1.0|Boring movie.  It's all about how each of the main characters are dealing with crappy marriages and how they almost cheat on their wives. Of course it is all happy endings here folks with over-the-top moments where they \\"expect\\" you to laugh.  LAME.
0937381888|5.0|Sure, you can find an older version of this book online for free. Apparently there is a [poor] Kindle version. But this is the kind of book you need to have in hard copy.

I just did my first all-grain batch, and this book was indispensable. There are also some recipes within, but don't most brewing books have those? A nice feature is that the recipes have variations for extract, partial mash, and all-grain.<br /><br />However, this is not a book for beginners. The book focuses on techniques and subjects more suited for intermediate to expert brewers. For beginners, Papazian's first book or \\"Homebrew for Dummies\\" are better choices (both good books in their own right).
B008BM9L72|4.0|Having read the whole trilogy I get the strange feeling that EL James could have achieved far more than she did!<br />The plot is good and some of the dialogues, specially the e-mails between the major characters are sometimes sublime, however two issues stand out that tarnish somewhat what otherwise would be a very good reading: 1) Too much sex, it becomes repetitive and thus looses some of the interest! 2) The BDSM issue that is clearly part of the interest is never really explored in a meaningful way, and that is a true loss since this could become a far richer reading if CG's tastes could be further explored.<br />Overall, still an entertaining reading, good for summer holidays (my case), and as previously stated ......Too much sex....but I guess that's part of the reason people like it!
B00499K9E0|4.0|I found the stories both interesting and well put together. What they have done is made the setting in modern London but used much of the old story and characters.<br /><br />The dialogue is good; I am sure whether most of it comes out of the book or whether the writers wrote in into the story,  but some of it is very good. I particularly like some of the quotes. They are very clever.<br /><br />The characters are interesting. I, particularly like Watson, who character is not the stuff shirt so often portrayed. I think his acting is very good.<br /><br />It is worth seeing.

I think I would have liked the story and understood it better without the pictures.<br />At the end of the book, Diana talks about how wonderful she thought this artist was.  I think it looks like he did the work while on LSD.  Not only did the illustrations not enhance the experience, they made it worse.  Some of the figures looked like grotesque monsters.  Stick figures would have been better.<br />Save your money.

B005UPOAT2|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY REISSUE ***<br /><br />It's so hard to get a rom-com right - and when it happens - it tends to eek its way into the hearts of millions of movie fans around the world. \\"Serendipity\\" is one of those films. And at last fans can finally get their hands on a High Definition copy of it in 2012 (January in the USA and February in the UK). And I'm glad to say that this Miramax/Lionsgate BLU RAY boasts a gorgeous print and decent extras. And it's cheap too...<br /><br />Defaulted to 1.78:1 ratio - the beautifully framed picture fills the entire screen with no bars top or bottom and no stretching of the image. And right from the get-go \\"Serendipity\\" looks 'so' good - crisp and clean images all the way through - with scene after scene using the New York locations to maximum effect. The soundtrack too has a strong 5.1 surround mix that amps up the great music.<br /><br />Written by MARC KLEIN and Directed by PETER CHELSOM - its casting puts together two really smart, likeable and able actors - JOHN CUSACK and KATE BECKINSALE. They play Jonathan Trager and Sarah Thomas - an American guy and an English girl whose fate is set in motion by a store assistant placing a pair of gloves on the sale rack in Bloomingdales a few weeks before Christmas. They obtain the gloves from another customer through mutual skulduggery and then spend a magical night getting to know each other in snowy New York (he comments that her arm freckles resemble Cassiopeia in the constellations - dialogue above). After hours of talking and a gut feeling that 'something' stellar is afoot - they pass on their respective phone numbers to each other - hers on the inside flap of the Gabriel Marquez book \\"Love In The Time Of Cholera\\" and his on a five-dollar bill. But of course the winds of fate intervene (literally) and each gets lost. Four years later we find that both Jonathan and Sarah have moved on with their lives and are now engaged to differing but largely unsuitable partners. But of course neither can help but wonder - was that person in New York a million hours back their soul mate - their \\"Godfather\\" original and not Part 2 the sequel? And should they ditch what they've settled for now and go searching for what they really want? And on the story goes in a hugely enjoyable way...<br /><br />In their manic searching and journey back to each other - they are ably assisted by a superb set of supporting roles - Jeremy Piven as Dean Kansky, Jonathan's loyal and witty friend, Molly Shannon as Sarah's scatterbrained pal Eve, John Corbett as a flute-playing egotistical musician trying to marry Sarah as long as it fits in with his European Tour and Eugene Levy as the eccentric and monthly-target-driven Bloomingdale's sales clerk. Both Piven and Levy have become huge since but can justifiably trace the public noticing them to this 2001 outing.<br /><br />The use of music in the film also deserves a special mention. A lot of the time - the typical rom-com is populated with lazy and obvious choices - not here. Not only do the songs suit the scene and the mood conveyed - they're tunes you probably done know but would want to. Bap Kennedy was the lead singer with a short-lived Northern Ireland band called Energy Orchard who then put out a lovely solo album called \\"Lonely Street\\" in 2000. The track lifted off it is called \\"Moonlight Kiss\\". When Jonathan and Sarah are trying to get to each other in the last portion of the movie, Chelsom uses the stunning \\"Rose Rouge\\" by St. Germain (on their \\"Tourist\\" album - itself due for a DELUXE EDITION double in 2012) which features a sample of Marlena Shaw chanting \\"I want you to get together...\\" over an incessant drum beat. There's the ethereally beautiful \\"Northern Sky\\" by England's Nick Drake on the ice rink (\\"I've never felt magic crazy as this...\\") and Annie Lennox's cleverly re-arranged cover of Bob Marley's \\"Waiting In Vain\\". There are also nice contributions by John Mayer, Shawn Colvin and HeatherNova. But the unsung gem here is an acoustic instrumental that's used as link-music throughout the entire film. It's by England's David Gray and is called \\"January Rain\\" - it turned up on his lesser-heard \\"Lost Songs 95-98\\" CD along with the equally moving \\"Flame Turns Blue\\" (which I hope to use in a screenplay one day).<br /><br />To sum up - like George Clooney's \\"One Fine Day\\", Pierce Brosnan's \\"Laws Of Attraction\\" and Richard Gere's \\"Shall We Dance\\" - \\"Serendipity\\" is an underrated but properly lovely watch - and this BLU RAY finally does full justice to its multiple charms.<br /><br />Get all metaphysical on yo ass people - and buy it.<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />Audio: DTS-HD Master Audio Surround 5.1<br />Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1 (Full Screen)<br />Language: English<br />Subtitles: English and English for the Hard-Of-Hearing.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />1.

0786915749|1.0|Argh!  I really, really hated this Dragons of... trilogy.  If the characters weren't whining they were crying (a lot).  If they weren't crying (a lot), they were whining.  The characters were afraid of EVERYTHING - from the big bad Queen of Darkness to the mouse in the corner.  And when they were being heroic, they were so far over the top that it was comical.  I guess if you liked the Twilight Saga series, you will probably like this trilogy.  Oh the angst, oh the anguish, oh please someone get me a barf bag.  If you could give negative stars I would.  At this point, your are probably asking - \\"Well, why on earth did you finish the trilogy?\\".  Because I bought it and I always finish the books I buy.  Besides, I have been a huge D & D fan for decades and kept hoping the books would get better.
014241543X|5.0|I'm a classical musician, and I didn't realize that Mia was also one before I read this.  Forget the cover - the cover makes the book look like it's really bad.  It's actually really, really good.  It's bitter and sad and sweet and beautiful all at once.  Poignant.  If you want to be moved, truly moved, read this.  I hope I can be the kind of parents Mia's parents were.<br /><br />Read this.
