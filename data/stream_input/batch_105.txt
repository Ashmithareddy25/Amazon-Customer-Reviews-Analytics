B000002UYZ|5.0|This is not a greatest hits, at least....it wasnt ment to be, it was SUPPOSE to represent what the group had done in the years 1962-1966, does  it do that? to an extent yes....and to an extent no.  Why 5 stars? because  these songs are still great, and The Beatles are so good even when songs  are left off, it still has the 5 star rating. Btw,rumor has it John picked  out some or all of these songs and George picked out the 1967-1970, if  thats true, in some ways it shows in the selections.This 2 CD set is for  people that like the hits from 1962-66 only, why? because almost all are  here, which means they (Apple) should have came out with 3 records in 1973  and 3 CDs(EMI/Capitol/Apple) in 1993.Is there a lot missing? if this was  suppose to represent the Beatles Career from 1962-1966, the answer is  yes.At least 12 songs are missing, and 2 are George songs, take your pick,  he had about 5 or so good ones by 1966.The ones they shouldnt have left  off, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret&quot;,  &quot;It Wont Be Long&quot;, &quot;If I Fell&quot;, No Reply, I'm A  Loser&quot;, The Night Before&quot; &quot;I Need You&quot;, &quot;Its Only  Love&quot;, Taxman, And Your Bird Can Sing, and &quot;Rain&quot;.Again if  you like the hits (or your a completest and you need this in your  collection) then start with this one especially if your just starting out,  then the 1967-1970, then maybe &quot;Help!&quot; or &quot;A Hard Days  Night&quot; because they're easy to take in, after that take your pick,  they're all great.

1572701137|5.0|Anna Massey's dramatic voice provides just the right degree of drama and  tension for Rebecca, the psychological story of a young woman's  confrontations with a remote employer, a hostile housekeeper, and the ghost  of a past wife. The unabridged presentation allows for full appreciation of  Du Maurier's works and subtlety: highly recommended.
0792844890|5.0|this is a entertaining and funny Movie which will make you laugh hard. if  you like ID4, men in black, Howard the Duck and other films of Sci-fi then  this is your Movie.
6304618344|4.0|Hmmmm....... now this is John Woo! <br />''It like looking in a mirror, only....... not''<br />Since John Woo had done his Hollywood debut there have  been 2 movies that John Woo have directed!(if we now count away MI2,  Mission Impossible 2) One is Hard Target, and the other one is Broken  Arrow......... Now, this two movies have not shown up the quality of the  real John Woo Action(masterpiece)style! <br />BUT THIS ONE  HAS! <br />(Castor Troy=Nicholas Cage) (Sean  Archer =John Travolta)  <br />The Story is quite orginal, but i dont have  mutch time so im gonna take it all in a nutshell: Castor(the terrorist)  tryes to kill Sean Archer(FBI), but instead he kills his son, Michael! So  now Archer has been trying to cath Castor Troy for eight years, and now he  finally does it!  (In a airport warehouse, after an magical gun fight) So,  Castor wounds up in an koma, but before that he, and his brother Pollux  placed a bomb, somewhere in the town! So Archer investigate Pollux, but he  does'nt get anything out of it, so he turns into Castor, by an operation,  to get some info out of Pollux. And now he finally does! But Castor awakens  from  his koma and takes Archers place, and it's now evreything begins!  (Okay, this was'nt a nutshell........ this was one big, giant   coconut!)<br />Wow! This is John Woo trademark! The fantastic two fisted  gunfights, the doves, the chirch, ''the eternal fight beetween good and  evil!'' You should have seen this, either you're a John Woo fan or not!  This is great! It's not as great as The Killer, Hard Boiled, ex ex! But  still it's his greatest Hollywood film! The only thing to complain on is  the happy ending with makes me a little bit sick, and the fact that it's  MUTCH more yabba yabba yabba(talk) then high quality action! But the great  lines and the teriffic dialouge makes up for it!<br />This is John Woo, you  can see it right away! So my advice is go and buy this now. Dont rent, BUY!  So you have your own copy, that you can watch on as much as you like!  Because i think you're gonna need it!<br />''Ready, Ready for the big ride,  Baby!''
B00004TVV1|5.0|This is, in my opinion up there with the greatest jazz recordings of all  time.  First, you've got the two greatest jazz musicians ever together,  playing 17 charts like they are all new.  I would pay the full 2-CD price  for just the one cut , &quot;Azalea&quot;, Duke Ellington's composition  that definetely  stands out as one of his best!  And with Louis Armstrong's  amazing virtuosity, one can't go wrong....
0061020710|4.0|No, you do not need to read this book to read the rest of the Discworld  series, but I would definitely recommend it - besides, it's the first book  so why would you want to miss out?  In my opinion, I thought this book was  great, but I would have to say that of all the books that I've read from  the Discworld Series (and I haven't read them all yet), I would have to say  that Lords &amp; Ladies has been the best.  Nonetheless, if you're a Terry  Pratchett fan, you should get this book!
B00004W5UA|5.0|Wow, was I misled by reviewers on this. Fight Club is one of those rare, precious movies that has the power to rachet up your consciousness to a new  level - but only if you're ready. If not, then you just ate the clam  chowder. Do you think this was a commentary on the evils of consumerism, or  male angst in modern post-industrialist society? Tsk. Okay, we'll give you  a social promotion out of kindergarten. Those were not themes but merely  mediums of the message. Nor was this movie about being violent. It was  about allowing YOURSELF to take the hits. It was about allowing life to  maul you, being willing to bleed freely. To feel, to flow, to live, to  change, to die. This is the timeless, universal challenge of every human  who ever lived, spirit trapped in flesh, learning to ride rather than fight  the suffering and thus to live exuberantly every moment.
0792843584|3.0|How suicidal was Michaël Cimino's bet to believe that HEAVEN'S GATE, a  western, an already dying Hollywood genre in 1976, without indians nor  Clint, had the tiniest chance to score in the U.S. box-office ! How could  he believe for a minute that the average audience would care for such  anti-heroes as Ella, the prostitute, or a sherif without a star, during 219  minutes ! I couldn't refrain myself to think, while I was watching Brad  Dourif's character throwing bombs towards the enemy camp as if he was a  russian revolutionist, that Michaël Cimino was engaged in a desperate  battle against the Hollywoodian establishment.<br />HEAVEN'S GATE is a great  sick movie, the kind of movie that can move you a lot more than the  hundreds of films you have swallowed last year. I love these movies but,  nevertheless, I'm not afraid to admit that they are not masterpieces.  HEAVEN'S GATE has moments of pure cinema but it also bored me during long  minutes with endless scenes that didn't have the slightest interest.<br />So,  if you're a curious movie lover, you surely already have this DVD in your  library because, in a way, HEAVEN'S GATE is part of Movie History but if  you're just looking for a good saturday night movie to rent, skip it.<br />Average sound and images and only a trailer as extra-feature.<br />A DVD  for Christopher Walken.
B0000024SI|5.0|Much is written about the historical importance of this record and Dylan's influence on &quot;pop music&quot; and the Beatles' influence on Dylan.   It's all well-documented fact, but Highway 61 Revisited, the album, is its  own best justification.  The musical grounding is Chicago blues, country  blues, &quot;churchhouse blues,&quot; early rock and roll music.  Dylan and  the British blues-rockers (Rolling Stones, Animals - not the Beatles)  actually share the same influences (Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters/Howlin'  Wolf, and so on).  Ultimately Dylan sounds like none other than himself.   <br />The songwriting is unsurpassed, for its type, and a crack band delivers  kicks and ominous licks that make the album a seminal 60s rock document.   From end to end, this is Dylan's toughest, hardest-rocking album - a leap  forward from the half-acoustic Bringing It All Back Home.  Dylan has  released different versions of these songs over the years (live versions,  alternate studio takes), but he's rarely improved on these original tracks.   Dylan also maintains a deadpan, sometimes stoned-out sense of humor that  is missing from much of his later work.  This is one of my two or three  desert island discs, and it's probably the best value for your $10 (plus  shipping and handling).
0062502182|5.0|Coelho tells a wonderful story about an Andalusian shepherd boy and his  search for the treasure promised to him by a fortune teller, but even more  interesting is the not-so-subtle message he weaves into the tale. Although  this was originally written in Portuguese, the translation reads with a  poetic quality that contributes to the magical themes of the novel. Read  this book. You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXGG|3.0|I saw this movie, and I didn't know what to expect. I thought Black Mask  was terrible, especially with the Tacked on rap music that had nothing to  do with the film. Much like Rush Hour this movies hook is not so much Jet  Li, but really Aliyah. I do have alot of view points when it comes to this  movie. Its watchable, with some neat new effects, but its not great.  Especially compared to Li's older films.  First and foremost I would  reccomend any of the &quot;Jet Li Collection films&quot; such as Fist of  Legend and the Enforcer. And on a lower level, Twin Warriors. <br />Now onto  this movie. The story was actually very good, the supporting cast of lesser  known actors pulled through. Especially  Aliyahs family. I mention this  only cause typically the background characters aren't much, and in these  kind of films add nothing to the film. This wasn't one of those cases. It  TOUCHED on the Romeo and Juliet story, but after that it didn't feel much  like it at all. Jet Li and Aliyah had a great chemistry that was NOT ruined  by a cheesy &quot;love at first site.&quot; Infact there is little to no,  love story at all.  Much better then the Mission Impossible 2 &quot;love  story.&quot; Which totally ruined that movie.<br />The martial arts, like most  American-Chinese martial arts films, aren't even close to the REAL talents  of Jet Li. I wasn't surprised cause until Shangai Noon, Jackie Chan got the  same treatment. The few scenes were neat, but nothing special. There are  too few &quot;WOW&quot; moments. The neat &quot;bone crunching&quot; effect  was very interesting and original. (If you don't know what I mean, you'll  understand when you see the film) But once again, there wasn't enough of  it, and it just made you wanna see more of it. <br />Above the negative, the  movie DID entertain. I don't know if that was enough for me to BUY it. But  I will wanna see it at least 2 o 3 more times.  Jet li shows alot of  promise in American Films. I hope his next film will rely more on HIM then  other actors.
B00000DC4A|5.0|I have to agree with a previous reviewer.  When I first heard this CD I  was not too impressed.  BUT after listening to it again it is by far one of  our favorites!  I was not a Brian Adams fan in the 80's but now own nearly  all of his CD's!  The kids love &quot;On A Day Like Today&quot; and  &quot;18 till I Die&quot;.  In my opinion there is not a bad track on  either of these albums!!
6302378648|5.0|I am a huge fan of suspense films, anything from low-budget indie efforts  to big-budget hollywood thrillers, but 1991's &quot;Cape Fear&quot; is  definitely in my top 5!  Nick Nolte is superb and believably human as the  strained and stressed southern lawyer whose family life and professional  life is falling apart.  But the real show stopper is Robert DeNiro as the  menacing psycho, Max Cady.  From the moment you meet him in his 8x9 cell in  prison you know he is insane.  And in the bravura finale on Cape Fear he  goes gleefully over-the-top and lets all hell break loose.  If you are  squeamish or easily disturbed, this film is not for you.  There is extreme  violence in a few portions of the film and a hard-to-take scene where Cady  mutilates a woman in her apartment.  But if you are a suspense fan and are  in the mood for an emotional and tense film, &quot;Cape Fear&quot; is for  you!
B00000JCOV|5.0|If you dont own this CD yet, order it. If you do, thank god, you can back  me up, you know what is going on. Phew, you ordered, now turn up your bass  and volume real high and listen to &quot;(sic)&quot; and &quot;Wait and  Bleed&quot; }:-)
B00004TH83|5.0|What a voice. <br />I picked up the CD actually on a lark; browsing through  the sample CDs sitting on a rack in Borders, I caught sight of Lara  Fabian's debut English album, sporting a rather large sticker on the bottom  right-hand corner of the album proclaimed &quot;Lara Fabian's Voice has  Stormed the World&quot; (or something to that effect; it's been a few  weeks). Two songs were recommended by the sticker: &quot;I Will Love  Again&quot; and &quot;Adagio&quot;. I didn't quite like &quot;IWLA&quot; at  that time (I can listen to it over and over again now!), so I picked track  number 11, &quot;Adagio&quot;, to listen to. <br />I was blown away. She has  _such_ a voice, it rivals anything out there at the moment. My first  impression was that Celine Dion had nothing on her; while Celine's voice is  somewhat high-pitched and shrill, Lara's is a fine blend of smoky  sensousness and raw emotion. She has excellent control over her voice and  her talent really shines in songs like &quot;You're Not From Here&quot; and  &quot;Broken Vow&quot;, where she goes from soft, regret-laden to uplifting  higher pitches. <br />And what's really surprising is that she pens her own  songs as well. I believe she described herself as a &quot;songbird with a  voice&quot;, and I wholly agree. <br />But, really, this isn't a review about  Lara's voice alone. Her album, although I have fallen in love with it now,  didn't quite do &quot;it&quot; for me the first time I listened through the  entire CD. Certain songs require a second or third play for it to really  sink in and take your breath away (e.g. &quot;Till I Get Over You&quot; and  &quot;Yeliel&quot;). But then again, isn't this true of many music albums?  Nevertheless, even though I recently bought three new CDs (Celine Dion's  &quot;A Decade of Song&quot; being one of them), I still find myself  popping Lara Fabian's album into the CD-player, anticipating that rush that  accompanies some of her more powerful songs.
B000024ZLX|5.0|Like a lot of Roger Waters albums, it took a while for me to fall in love  with this one.  I would now recommend it to anyone with any kind of  interest in a musical and lyrical journey into the mind of a man touched  profoundly by war.  The music is haunting at times, and the lyrics are  intelligently written.  The title track is a tear jerker.<br />Buy it!
0871917602|5.0|Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a  variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and  improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading,  your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better  to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time  together watching television fails as a substitute.<br />To help other  parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our  youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were  read to her as a young child. Mr. Messy was one of her picks.<br />Mr. Messy  really is aptly named.  He lived in a messy looking house with peeling  paint, broken windows, a garden gate falling off its hinges, uncut grass,  random items all over the house along with an unmade bed, and a broom that  he tripped on in the garden.  In fact, he was so messy, he bothered my  daughter.  As a result, she did something that she usually did not do . . .  she got her crayons out and began making things look better.<br />Then Mr.  Messy went for a walk and found the neatest cottage he had ever seen.  Outside were Mr. Clean and Mr. Neat who were tidying things up.  They asked  Mr. Messy if they could help him.  Mr. Messy agreed, and they quickly  cleaned up the outside.  Then they cleaned up the inside.  Then, they  realized that Mr. Messy needed work, too, and they cleaned him up also.  After that, Mr. Messy said that 'I'm going to have to change my name!'  All  three became best of friends.<br />For years, whenever our daughter's room  would start to get messy, we would ask her if she wanted a visit from Mr.  Neat and Mr. Clean.  She would laugh and start picking things up.<br />This  is a good book for helping your child learn good tidiness habits, because  the consequences of the alternative become obvious in a particularly  humorous way.

B0000021RB|5.0|Many long-term Chicago fans will tell you that the band was never better  than on this, their first album. I definitely include it among my top two  or three. Those who came to know Chicago only during (or after) the  Peter-Cetera-ballads phase could very well be surprised with a listen.  Because, above all else, the first album shows that once upon a time  Chicago was a free-playing Rock Band - with horns thrown in.<br />The proof  begins on the very first track, appropriately titled \\"Introduction\\".  Launching with a bluesy horn riff over a rocking rhythm chart, the band  proceeds to display its considerable versatility in the next six-and-a-half  minutes. \\"If you've nothing to do, sit back and let it through and let us  play for you\\" sings guitarist Terry Kath before the band moves through its  paces. Styles change along with key and time signatures, leading to a  central episode that is hard rock worthy of Hendrix. (This album should  convince most observers that comparisons of Kath to Hendrix are not  gratuitous.)  But, lest the band be pigeonholed, \\"Introduction's\\" final  chord is a dissonant seven voice jazz chord worthy of Kenton.<br />The album  then moves to the well-known singles including \\"Does Anybody Really Know  What Time It Is?\\" and \\"Beginnings\\". Admittedly these sound a bit shop worn  after thirty years, but they yield overlooked surprises. For example,  listen to Peter Cetera's bass-playing throughout. Much more than simply  playing the chord roots, he was constantly inventing rhythmic  counter-melodies. (He would achieve a peak with this style three years  later on \\"Dialogue\\".)  But the gems of the album are the songs that weren't  singles:  \\"Listen\\", which like \\"Introduction\\" is a song about the band's  craft; and \\"Poem 58\\" and \\"South California Purples\\", hard rock tunes the  likes of which would rarely be heard on future Chicago albums. My favorite  track is \\"Someday\\", a tune about the '68 Democratic Convention with an  extremely inventive harmonic structure.<br />The only real drawback is that  the album is a bit long - it was the first of Chicago's double LP sets and  is not as concise a statement as Chicago II, or even Chicago III. But this  is also a benefit (\\"Free Form Guitar\\" excepted) in that it gives the rhythm  section an opportunity to shine.  Which, in the end, is the story of this  album. Chicago would go on to bigger stardom, and even some (arguably)  better albums, but they would never again approach the energetic,  uninhibited rock of Chicago I.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere is another masterpiece by Neil Gaiman, who takes the reader and  shows him just how deep down the rabbit hole goes.  <br />For the main  character, Richard Mayhew, his trip to London Under is a confusing and  harrowing journey that nearly ends his life on a matter of occasions, but  for the reader it is a magical journey that explains those little things  that we just catch in the corner of our eyes on dark nights.<br />This book  has it all: humor, drama, comedy and even some horror.  Throw in the  villian and some betrayals and you have a rollercoaster of a good time.   Highly recommended!
B00004WIBW|5.0|While Burton's &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; isn't Washington Irvings', the fact is that the movie is simply wonderful.  Forget the book for a while  and enjoy it. The photography is amazing and the idea of using Ichabod  Crane to parody the image of the image of the distant, calculating  detective is brillant!  The pacing and infusion of comedy makes the entire  film a joy to watch.  The sequence of the horseman stalking a small child  in a home will make you hold your breath.  The performances are flawless  and the special effects are done to enhance the story line, rather than  being an end in themselves.  Which is what special effects are supposed to  do, in my view.  Burton and Depp are a wonderful team together and I hope  they do many more projects in the future. :)
0380804557|5.0|This wonderful story is what I would describe as the best fairytale for  those of us who aren't quite kids anymore, but still enjoy a tale of  adventure and fun.<br />Stardust is a great tale of a clumsy child who finds  his way through the Fairy realm and discovers not only a few things about  himself, but also some things about his past.<br />A great and moving story,  this book belongs on everyone's shelf if anything to remind you that yes,  you were a kid once, and yes, you can regain that feeling again.
0440180295|5.0|While most people tend to categorize this book as sci-fi with a purpose, I think it should be lended the legitimacy it deserves.  Science-fiction  carries a connotation of being less than top-notch, but more importantly,  this book has few of the charateristics of a sci-fi novel.  The main  character, Billy Pilgrim, while an advid proponet of the Jim Marr's-type  &quot;Aliens Are Among Us&quot; routine, is merely dabbling in the device  used to tell the story.  These mysterious and all-knowing Tralfamadorians  scatter Billy through his life in a very vivid staccato space jump.   However, the importance is not these creatures, but the metaphor.  These  aliens are merely the device that makes Billy see--for the first time--the  insanity of this so-called life of ours.  While the novel has these  conspicuous sci-fi tendencies, the rest of the book is more a story of very  human encounters with everyday run-of-the-mill psychopaths, perverts, obese  better-halfs, et cetera.  And while the moral lesson is a heavy one, this  is one of the most entertaining anit-war books ever written.  Certainly one  of the best books of the second half of the 20th century.
B000002AP1|5.0|I was raised on the original vinyl and wore it out.  This is the 21st  century and this revamped version roars out of my speakers (often).   There's nothing wrong with improvement, as long as the spirit of the  original stays intact, or is enhanced as it is here.  I had the CD of the  original and bought this-it was well worth it!  This rocks even harder!
0736644296|3.0|I find many people that review this book critically begin by slighting the  broken spanish Hemmingway uses so expertly.  Mostly those who speak the  language who wish to flex their bilingual muscle.  However, as with anyone  who has read much--if any--Hemmingway, you have to realize that everything  is done for a reason.  It's all about point of view.  He's painting the  picture.  He wants you to see it the way it is portrayed, no matter his  reasons.  People who have problems with his techniques have a problem with  the author.  Similarly, many people describe the relationship discourse (as  it were) to be manufactured or absent any real genuine human emotion.   Again, that would be called typical Hemmingway.  As he has been known to be  quite cynical and distrustful of women; some women even think of him as a  misogynist.  This distrust is what is portrayed in the novel, very well I  might add.  Basically, either you love Hemmingway, you don't, or you don't  get it at all.  And if you are the latter, sit down and shut up, because  he's here to stay.  This book was incredibly well written and it should be  among the greatest works of the century.
B00004VWA7|5.0|what can i say? Jaco is the baddest cat that ever was. I'm trying to  gather everything he ever laid down on tape and this album was the first of  my collection.  Amazing.  This one never leaves my cd changer.
0465068359|2.0|It is absurd to flatly deny the civilian casualities in Nanjing during the Sino-Japanese conflict.  Far too many people were killed so  unnecessarily.<br />It is equally absurd to jump on this Japan-bashing orgy  that Iris Chang's book has created.<br />First her book is not a history book:  It is a book based on, among other things, second-hand &quot;witness&quot;  accounts and war-time propaganada photos.<br />More importantly, however, most  serious (i.e. fact-based) historians outside Japan believe the casualities  were probably in the tens of thousands.  Still too many, but this was  definitely not a &quot;holocaust&quot;.<br />Some of the references to the  atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - and how &quot;necessary&quot;  they were - in reviews presented here are plain sickening.  All indications  were that, by August 1945, the war was over.  Japan was no longer capable  of fighting.  At any rate specifically targeting and incinerating 200K+  civilians with A-bombs to achieve a war aim cannot possible be accetable.   More bluntly put, it is a classic war crime.<br />Maintaining a balanced  perspective on WWII - and learning from it - is critical in our efforts to  prevent another tragedy like this.

B00004T8RK|4.0|Two ellements are nessasary to seperate great rock and roll from average  rock and roll. One is &quot;SUBSTANCE&quot;, and the other is  &quot;TONE&quot;. As Neil Young has proven for decades; &quot;TONE&quot;  may be the most important of the two, but Pearl Jam has always seen fit to  give each ellement equal attention. &quot;BINAURL&quot; picks up right  where &quot;Yeild&quot; left off. Strong lyrics, and music that raises the  bar in an industry locked in mediocrity. This band has so much integrity  that, even though they have the ability to write prosaic, pedestrian, radio  fluff; they choose to take thier music to the limit. &quot;Nothing as it  Seems&quot; is a perfect example. Lush, perceptive, and elaborate, this  song incaptulates the essence of Pearl Jam. Everything on  &quot;BINAURL&quot; has it's own personality. My only complaint is that  it's running time is a bit on the short side, and the little ditty that has  become so familiar these days after a rather long pause was less than  gratifying. That said; I recomend this disc to everyone looking for rock  and roll with a brain, and a soul. Great stuff boys!!!!
B000001DYD|5.0|Rolling Stone said, &quot;she isnt like anybody else&quot; and I have  never agreed with them more.  P J's sound and words are like two separate  species of animals living in a symbiotic relationship. Its as though theyve  existed together for eons before man.   Her words are sometimes so overly  simplified that it seems darkly reminiscent of one half of the brain  talking to the other. Like  in a time before language, when concepts and  feeling were rattled arround the head ( amid much fustration), unable to  manifest themselves verbally.   the song  'Me Jane' a notable example, its  almost like the words she says arent really spoken  at all, but rather  primitive thoughts that you can only hear through telepathy. evesdropping  if you will, on one complex woman in all her emotional glory , and  fustrations! ......Well, it made sense in my head, before I put it into  words.  Maybe thats where all the other songwriters go wrong?
B000002NJM|5.0|The soundtrack to &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; is going to blow you away just like the film.  Quentin's choices on here are even smarter then the old  forgotten retro rock and funk of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  The only songs  &quot;Fiction&quot; like are the dark yet funky track by The Vampire Sound,  Inc and Elliot's Easton Tiki Gods with a slight surfer rock number.  In the  beginning and through most of the albums, get ready to be moved by some  soul.<br />It starts off with an awesome Bobby Womack song &quot;Across 110th  Street&quot;, with a soul lot of great singing on behalf of Womack not to  mention awesome story telling of life on the street.  The beautiful R&amp;B  tracks is kind of a theme song.  Great soul groups flex their vocal power  on here.  &quot;Strawberry Letter 23&quot; and &quot;Natural High&quot; are  great examples of radio soul and romance by the Brother Johnson and  Bloodstone respectively.  The Delfonics (one of the best vocal groups of  the era) shine on the big hit &quot;Didn't I Blow Your Mind This  Time&quot;.  It combines that great Motown arrangement just with a sweeter  lower sound.  You also get R&amp;B divas like Randy Crawford on the upbeat  sassy smart groove of &quot;Street Life&quot; while Minnie Riperton sweats  sex on the juicy disco moan of &quot;Inside My Love&quot;.  All the songs  are great and unique but it's really the funk and soul that burns brightest  here. Don't forget cute rap track by Foxy Brown and a nicely sung Pam  &quot;Jackie/Foxy Brown&quot; Grier on &quot;Long Time Woman&quot;.  Not  the best vocals, but you really feel it.  And there is also a live Johnny  Cash on &quot;Tennessee Stud&quot;.  I love every track for a different  reason.  <br />If you want a film that really captures it characters with  music, see the film then buy the soundtrack and think about the film.  If  you don't want to see an intelligent action movie, just buy the soundtrack  for a mixed bag of rare goodies.  The album is a must for fans of not only  R&amp;B, soul, funk, but also a few odditiy rock songs that sound really  well.  Just an awesome mixed bag of great music.
B000005J56|5.0|First of all I want to address some people....I really don't appreciate  how some people who don't favor this album, have to go and mock the country  in which this music came from....It is rude and childish.  Nobody ever said  that this album was hard-core salsa, so certain people should really keep  their mouths shut and stop giving the public false information.  Those  people know who they are.  This is the original Cuban son music which was  around WAY before the salsa or mambo of today.  Played by some of Cuba's  most gifted and talented artists who have been forgotten for so many  years.<br />The music in this album is suttle, but at the same time firey and  full of ritmo y pasión.  If you really want something to relax to....this  is what you need.  I recommend this album to EVERYONE!!!!  Even if you  don't speak Spanish, or have never listened to Latin music before....I'm  sure you will love this.  It is a masterpiece.  Got to love the  &quot;fuego&quot; in &quot;El Cuarto de Tula&quot;<br />Members of the Buena  Vista Social Club....<br />Ibrahím Ferrer, Omara Portuondo, Eliades Ochoa,  Rubén González, Orlando López &quot;Cachaíto&quot;, Compay Segundo, Manuel  Vazquez, Pío Leya, Manuel Licea, Barabito Torres, Juan De Marcos, Amarito  Valdés.
B000000W6F|4.0|This first disc by the Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Gish&quot; is not the light alternative rock from such albums as &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; but is  rather dark white noise sound rock.  The guitar driven sound is by far  there hardest, even edgier than some of the &quot;Manicna&quot; material  like &quot;Everlasting Gaze&quot;.  Also, the sound is just out there and  not overly produced.  It's just a band jamming and Billy Corgan's great  style of song writing.  <br />Tracks like &quot;I Am One&quot; and &quot;Bury  Me&quot; are forcefully hard.  They usher in the new style of hard rock  that isn't glitzy and cute but is thought provoking and intense.   &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; is welcome change of pace with a softer more melodic  tone to it with the guitars not coming in so loud and Billy crooning.   &quot;Window Pane&quot; is another slower rock song that rocks at setting  up an opportunity to let loose when that metal side kicks in.   &quot;Daydream&quot; shows another sensitive side with D'racy sounding very  sweet and lovely on this acoustic ballad.  For more distorted hardness,  look no further than the classic rock like riffs on &quot;Siva&quot;.   <br />The album goes from extremely hard to soft and feeling.  It's kind of a  mixed bag and you're not going to find any of those fun pop tunes that made  the Pumpkins famous in the mid nineties (&quot;Snail&quot; comes very close  to that style though).  It's a great debut and shows what this really  talented group of kids is capable of.
B0000203Y5|5.0|Ever since I got this I cannot stop watching it!!!!  Such beauty and  talent is so addicting....The beautiful images of Cuba and the artists  making the music with humor and every other emotion.  A MUST SEE FOR  EVERYONE!!!!
B000000OTU|5.0|&quot;Big Ones&quot; is surprisingly comprehensive for a set of hits from a group that couldn't stop cranking them out in that time period.   <br />Aerosmith is the best American rock band, period.  It wasn't until the  mid eighties that the really caught up with the rest of the world. The hits  started cranking out on their &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; album with  cool rock like &quot;Dude (Looks Like A Lady)&quot;, a very cleaver smack  at make up laced heavy metals stars.  I also can't forget the sensitive,  sweet sounds of &quot;Angel&quot; (talk about your AC Top 40 stuff) and the  unforgettable &quot;Rag Doll&quot; (Joe and Brad at his best guitar work  not to mention a great drum part on behalf of Joey and thumping bass by  Tom).  The &quot;Pump&quot; tracks also rock hard.  You got everything from  the catchy horns of  &quot;The Other Side&quot; to the painfully great love  county type song &quot;What It Takes&quot;.  The ultimate &quot;Pump&quot;  songs are Aerosmith's generally best ever from the mesmerizing story of  &quot;Janie's Got A Gun&quot; to the party fest of &quot;Love In An  Elevator&quot;.  Then comes the mixed bag of everything that is &quot;Get A  Grip&quot;.  Everything from the breakup standards like &quot;Cryin'&quot;  to the driving &quot;Eat The Rich&quot;.  Don't forget the new tracks  &quot;Walk On Water (sounds like old experimental Aero) and the hard rock  wisdom of &quot;Blind Man&quot;.  The extra &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot; is  a big could have been hit from the group off of &quot;The Beavis And  Butthead Experience&quot;. <br />The band really has it together here.  Great  party music with that's fun and with nice writing.  It's not as big as some  of their old Columbia stuff and not as gritty either.  It's just the band  playing their best and Steven singing his heart out.  I think I like the  &quot;Pump&quot; tracks the most and the &quot;Grip&quot; tracks are the  least awesome (still really good though, just not as excitingto me).  If  you love hard rock, this set is really for you.  The album is full of the  best of the decade and is a lot better-played then hair band stuff.
B000000LZV|5.0|Others have sufficiently spoken to the immortality of this brilliant recording.  I can say no more about that aspect that hasn't already been  said.<br />Instead, I will add some comments to hopefully clear up the track  listing questions some of you may have.<br />Original double-LP version has 45  tracks.<br />First CD issue (now out of print, replaced with the version  Amazon offers) contained 44 tracks, but four of those tracks were the  &quot;car jams&quot; (one for each band member, plus a &quot;Three Car  Jam&quot;) that were previously uncredited on the LP version.<br />The five  missing tracks from that CD issue were: &quot;Don't Look Now&quot;  (Fogerty); &quot;Mr Robot's Holy Orders&quot; (Hurley/Watt); &quot;Ain't  Talkin Bout Love&quot; (Van Halen/Van Halen/Roth/Anthony); &quot;Doctor  Wu&quot; (Becker/Fagen); and &quot;Little Man With A Gun In His Hand&quot;  (Dukowski/Boon).<br />The newer CD issue that Amazon offers has better sound  and packs a couple more songs in.  Now only three songs are missing:  &quot;Mr Robot's Holy Orders&quot;; &quot;Ain't Talkin Bout Love&quot;; and  &quot;Little Man With A Gun In His Hand.&quot;  (Note that the new issue  counts 43 tracks rather than the 42 you'd expect because they list the  &quot;Three Car Jam&quot; as a separate track at the end.)<br />Hope this  helps.  The new CD issue is pretty good.  Decent sound and the convenience  of CD format.<br />However, the vinyl still sounds even better (SST did a  great job mastering this album to vinyl!), and it includes all 45 tracks,  so track it down (sealed copies can still be found, my friends) for the  complete, original, unfiltered Double Nickels experience.
6305451591|5.0|I did not know if I wanted to see this film at first, as I am not usually  intrigued by foreign films.  This is definitely an exception!  I watched  this movie without knowing what it was about (I didn't want to know first)  and was completely surprised with the holocost theme.  While the holocost  itself was really a secondary part of the film, I was glad it showed simply  one family's experience because when we experience life, we never see the  whole picture, but rather what is happening to us at that moment in time.   That is how this movie viewed it, and showed one person's ability to keep  &quot;life beautiful&quot; for another, even through something unbelievably  ugly.<br />I highly recommend this film...no wonder it is an oscar winner!!
B0000028RR|5.0|When this CD first came out in the store, I didn´t have a clue what it  was.  In my hangout place i heard a song, next day I bought it. 10 really  great tracks on this CD.

0679731725|4.0|I spent a considerable amount of time trying to discover which of the characters in this novel are real and which are fictitious. An  understanding of pre-WW II history is helpful. The German Ambassador, Herr  Ribbontrop, is real. Herr Joachim von Ribbentrop was German Foreign  Minister to Adolf Hitler from 1938-1945. He was later hanged as a war  criminal. I could think of no specific reference for the mysterious French  liaison, M. DuPont, although it is probably to the famous French-American  industrialist, Pierre Samuel DuPont. As for Lewis, the tactless and  conniving senator from America, I found no direct correlation. However, I  suspect the reference here is to Edward Mandell House, a Texas politician  and diplomatic attache for Woodrow Wilson at Versailles. This historical  context is the setting for an exploration of 19th century values: dignity,  honor and loyality. These, in the 20th century amount to little more than  demagoguery. &quot;A lot of rot.&quot; according to a good citizen from  Devonshire. Ishiguro suggests that real power and influence lie not in the  chambers of government, but &quot;in the privacy and calm of the great  houses&quot; (p.115) and the great decisions of the world are made by  informal power brokers. The narrator of the story, &quot;Stevens&quot;, is  butler-valet to Lord Darlington (both fictitious), and is therefore privy  to the clandestine meetings of foreign dignitaries at Darlington Hall. The  questions of remorse and reparation are intimately reflected in Stevens'  relationship with the former housekeeper, Miss Kenton. The style of writing  is distinctly English. I found this novel quite enjoyable.
0767819446|4.0|I didn't have a clue of what this movie was about when a friend of mine lent me his copy one evening.  What I do know is that I was scratching my  head right off the bat.  However, the movie quickly ends my temporary  confusion when we are shown that the opening scenes are from a virtual  reality game that is so compelling (it places the player inside late 30's  L.A.) that the player actually feels these computer-generated characters  are real.  Indeed, the characters themselves think they are real.<br />What  starts as seemingly a rip off of \\"The Matrix\\" theme (or a greatly expanded  version of a Star Trek holodeck), quickly turns into a murder mystery, and  it is handled quite effectively (except for the virtual reality scenario,  it is nothing like \\"The Matrix\\").  Although the stars in the film aren't  household names, and some of the dialogue seemed just a tad pedestrian, the  story draws the viewer in and takes you on its own ride.  What was most  impressive was the recreation of early Los Angeles.  I was amazed at how  authentic everything looked.<br />\\"The Thirteenth Floor\\" is a clever film, in  that its \\"sum\\" is actually better than its \\"parts\\".  This movie could have  failed on several levels (I was fully anticipating it to fail), but somehow  it kept me captivated (and confused), then surprised the heck out of me.  Between 1 and 10, \\"The Thirteenth Floor gets a marginal 8.  I think most  viewers will be quickly drawn in and will enjoy the ride as much as I.
B000002UAF|4.0|This is one of my first beatles records and thought it extremely good. I really enjoyed it and it has promted me to look into and at the beatles in  more detail. Also it has made me want to hear more of their music. I am  fast becoming a very good fan of them.
0783227272|2.0|There is no honest representation of the African personality and cultural  background in the film. I did not have a clear concept of what was the  African cognitive/riligious/metaphysical concept of the tragedy of slavery.  They are defined mostly in an American Christian perspective. In one view  on La Amistad, you can barely distinguish the Africans performing Islamic  prayers in the background. None of the characters evoke any Islamic  statements of faith throughout the tragedy of enslavement and loss in the  sea. In another scene, the imprisoned Africans are dancing &quot;noble  savage&quot; style around a bonefire INSIDE the prison. How could that be  possible is beyond my imagination! The director is trying to fall back on  the old western movie depictions of the native indians running around the  camp fire performing the battle dance. The real theme of the story is not  the suffering of the Aficans enslaved and inside filthy ships in the  Atlantic; it is about the American society's treatment of the issue of  slavery and the true nature of the American system of government. Needless  to say that the director wants to tell the audience a political message:  that the core of the American political system is ethical and  &quot;GOOD&quot; hearted. The only characters shown in the movie to  actually benfit financially from the slave trade were the Spanish, the  Africans who cought Cinque,and the Cubans. Not a single scene brings to the  viewer's attention images of the suffering of the slaves in an American  plantation. This is an oversimplification of a complex issue, and a  superficial evaluation of important questions within a commerical context.
B00000J7J4|3.0|Well, I certainly didn't expect this album to be quite so  &quot;pop-ish&quot; as it is.  I wanted more of the old Santana, the stuff  like he did back in the '70's, and there's not much of that in this album.  &quot;Smooth&quot; is a good tune that has been overplayed, and the rest of  the cuts just don't stand out for me for some reason.  If you've been a  Santana fan for a while, you might want to make sure you listen to the CD  before you buy it if it's possible.
0060273224|2.0|Sabriel was good the first few pages, but then it just got so BORING!!!!  Practically all of the reviewers loved it, but I was so happy when the book  was finally over. There were many exciting parts, but then they would fade  into boring parts which would become exciting parts. The boring  parts were  just daring me to stop reading.<br />Garth Nix created a fantastically  realistic world where  there are machines, but there is also still magic.  Sabriel inherits the family business when she hears that her father is in  danger and is in the afterlife or whatever. So she becomes the necromancer  and battles the dead to find her father. She also meets up with some  sidekicks to help her, and on comes the long, long, long, long, journey to  free  her father.<br />Like I wrote, the world is excellent, but the  characters weren't. It seemed like Sabriel never had much emotion, and I  could never &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;think&quot; like all of the  characters. The plot was really good, ( I certainly would have never  thought of necromancers and all ) And, although the very important role  that death played in this book, I was never sad or deppressed. So I just  wish that Sabriel would have been shorter or had  more exciting parts to  touch up the rather dull parts of the book.
6305897786|2.0|To start, I will confess I was very disappointed with this movie.  I somehow was lead to believe that I was going to see a thriller with a lot  of suspense and a touch of horror.  On the other hand, what I got was a  mystery novel, a very slow moving mystery novel.  It actually took over two  hours to tell a very simple story (which I have reduced to one  paragraph).<br />Three copies exist of the demonic book called &quot;The Ninth  Gate&quot;.  Balkan has acquired one and believes that his may not be  authentic.  He hires Corso (Johnny Depp), some type of book mercenary, to  determine which of the three copies is authentic.  Corso travels to Europe,  views the other two copies, and determines that the three are authentic but  not identical.  All three books have nine similar drawings, but only three  specific drawings of each book are to be used to assemble the nine needed  perform a mysterious incantation.  Corso figures out how to identify the  correct nine drawings.  With this information, Balkan attempts to recite  the incantation, which does not work.  Corso's mysterious follower, who may  be the Devil herself, tells him that Balkan failed because one of the  drawings he had was a forgery.    She then tells Corso where to find the  remaining drawing.  At the end, we see Corso headed to the ruins referenced  in the book, presumably to recite the incantation.  It is assumed the  incantation will give him unlimited power.<br />As simple as this plot is,  this lengthy movie leaves a number of unanswered questions such as: What  exactly is Corso going to do at the end? Who is the woman who mysteriously  followed him throughout the movie?  Why did he not recognize her  immediately (she looked exactly like the drawing in the book)?  Why did she  choose him to have the correct nine drawings?  What exactly is the mystery  of the ninth gate?<br />Perhaps the director assumed most of us had read the  book upon which the movie is based and knew the answers to these questions.   I also believe the director couldn't decide what kind of story he was  telling (mystery, drama, suspense...)  and couldn't develop his characters.   At the end, the protagonist is not any better for what has happened or any  worse; instead, he seems unchanged (and as one-dimensional as he was at the  start).<br />Though his character learned nothing during the move, Johnny Depp  sure did an excellent job as Dean Corso.  The rest of the cast is also  competent in this otherwise dull movie.
0913866156|5.0|This is the best deck that i have ever seen. It has beautiful artwork and  gives accurate readings that are so true it's scary. This is the first  tarot deck that i have ever owned and i will continue to use it until it is  so worn that i have to replace it. It helps to have some tarot or symbolism  background, but if you don't it comes with a cute little cheat book.  Remember- tarot cards won't work properly if you buy them for yourself!!!  You are supposed to receive them as a gift. I'd also reccomend keeping them  in a self-made pouch or baggie prefferably of black or purple silk. Anyway  - they are the best ever!!!
B000009EAD|5.0|I listened to some samples of 'Blessed Are You' and 'Melancholy', and I  suddenly realized that this is the kind of music I love.  This is the kind  of music that can soothe your soul, move your heart, and make you want to  jump up and play your air guitar all at the same time.  If you're a fan of  Metallica, you will have no trouble buying this Iced Earth cd.  In fact,  you might like it even more when you consider the awesome cover art was  done by Greg Capullo(one of the best comic book artists).
6305265488|5.0|Ever After is and exelent, brilent, exciting, I could go on and on but the  point is it's great.<br />I like that the stuck to the Cinderella part with  the evil step mother but in this case there is only one evil step sister  the other one is desigring about it all.<br />And I also like the difference  in the Cinderella part because it makes the movie more interasting and  exciting. And I like it that Danille(Cinderalla) and the Prince knew each  other before the main Cinderalla part. And I also like it that they had the  part when the father dies and that they say where the movie is taking  place. Oh and you never know whats going to happen next.<br />Rent or Buy this  movie today, you'll love it. Happy watching.
0060977493|4.0|This highly stylized novel tells the tale of a turbulent, patrician,  Syrian Christian family from a small town in Kerala, in the southernmost  tip of India.<br />The plot centers on the seven year old fraternal twins  Esthappen (Estha) and Rahel and is told from the point of view of  Rahel.<br />A strange and eccentric cast of characters rounds out the family  with whom Estha and Rahel live.  There is Blind Mammachi, the twins'  grandmother and founder of Paradise Pickles and Preserves.  Blind Mammachi  is a virtuous violin-playing widow who suffered years of unwarranted abuse  at the hands of her highly-respected husband and who now has a fierce  one-sided Oedipal connection with her son, Chacko.<br />There is Estha and  Rahel's grandaunt, Baby Kochamma, who totters on air cushions for feet  while playing out the bitterness of her lifetime of unrequited love for an  Irish Roman Catholic priest; she even converted to Catholicism in order to  win him...just as he was converting to Hinduism.  Now, a spiteful, spirited  spinster, Baby Kochamma spends her days savoring soap operas and satellite  television wrestling matches.<br />And then, there is Velutha, the title  character, an ebulliently talented handyman, tainted by his Paravan  lineage.<br />Chacko, who is now divorced from his English wife and who hasn't  seen his baby daughter since her infancy, runs Paradise Pickles and  Preserves with the iron hand of what he deludes himself into thinking is  communism, even as he flirts with and beds his female employees.<br />The  twins' mother, Ammu, is a divorcée (and a devotée of divorce), who fled her  tyrannical husband's alcoholism and incessantly insistent demands, and yet  Ammu, herself, is a wilfull woman with a wickedly wild side that will prove  to be the undoing of both herself and her unsuspecting family.  A feminist  before feminism, Ammu cannot decide on a last name, because as she says,  &quot;choosing between her husband's name and her father's name didn't give  a woman much of a choice.&quot;  At all.<br />Roy's characters are both fun  and funny because &quot;They broke all the rules.  They crossed into  forbidden territory.  They tampered with the laws that lay down who should  be loved and how.  And how much.  The laws that make grandmothers  grandmothers, uncles uncles, mothers mothers, cousins cousins, jam jam and  jelly jelly.&quot;  With the exception if Ammu and Chacko, though, they  are, unfortunately, made of plaster already filled with cracks and holes  and ready to crumble, rather than solidly constructed of flesh and blood  and, therefore, they suffer the fate of the not-very-believable.<br />The  tragedy in this book revolves around the visit of Chacko's ex-wife, now a  willing widow courtesy of her second husband, and Chacko's daughter, Sophie  Mol.  Together this eclectically and fatally-fractured family will endure  an inexorable egress toward disillusion, madness, guilt, betrayal and  death.  Lives, of course, will be forever fragmented as the one aspect all  the characters share is their own vulnerability; the ability to be  physically and psychologically wounded.<br />Lovers of Hemingway should  definitely eschew this book, for this is no linear, spare story.  A  densely-woven tapestry made of constantly undulating, heavily-layered plots  and lush torrents of newly-minted words and phrases, The God of Small  Things is told in flashbacks and flashforwards and twists and turns that  are as fresh and original as a newly-hybridized tomato, straight off the  vine.  This is good, brilliant even, when there is a story to tell.  The  God of Small Things, however, might just be a little short on story and a  little long on style.<br />Although Roy's dazzlingly daunting and agile  ability to turn a phrase cannot be denied, it is her breathtaking aptitude  for summing up a damaged life in one or two felicitous phrases that  constitutes her major talent, for instance, the description of the  great-grandmother's portrait:  &quot;With her eyes she looked in the  direction her husband looked.  With her heart she looked away.&quot;  Or,  &quot;Baby Kochamma had lived her life backwards.  As a young woman she  renounced the material word, and now, as an old one, she seemed to embrace  it.  She hugged it and it hugged her back.&quot;<br />As brilliant and  original as this book is, it is certainly not a masterpiece.  Despite its  fine, often heady, writing, there remains something of the formulaic about  it.  Evocative and sensual descriptions aside, the tragedy that occurs and  the love affair that ensues are both predictable and implausible, in part,  because they spring from neither characterization nor the needs of the  unfolding (sort-of) non-plot.<br />The word play and the all-pervasive use of  children's lingo, devices that serve to make the beginning of the novel  sparkle and shine like sunshine on sea water, begin to wear as thin as a  poor man's watered-down gruel after one hundred pages (more or less), and  become both predictable and tedious.<br />And, of course, there are several  scenes (the most glaring taking place in a theatre) that seem quite  gratuitous, something that Roy seemed to have inserted simply to shock for  shock's sake.  In a day and age when nothing shocks but the unvarnished  truth (and even then, not always), these scenes are simply irritating and  definitely detract from the would-be charms of the novel.<br />The bottom  line, for most readers, will not be the plot, or even the lack thereof, but  their view of Roy's original prose style.  Is it ostentatious or is it  brilliant?  Readers who find The Old Man the Sea the pinnacle of style  should probably stay away.  But those who enjoy working their way with a  machete through a veritable forest of a book, filled with lush,  densely-growing undergrowth, should find The God of Small Things nothing  short of fantastic.

B00004R99I|2.0|Now just listen to me here. Imagine the disney movie life as pryimid. First we had Beauty and the Beast, then we had Aladdin, then the Lion King  shot the Disney movie quality to the top of the pyrmid. Then came  Pocahontas.<br />And Disney took a nose dive.<br />Making the classic tale of  Pocahontas into a movie may have sounded like a good idea. But with all the  crazy historical innacuricies you need to wonder what story it was actually  based on. I'm sure by now you all know what really happened in the end. And  John Smith's version of the tale was an exageration from the beginning (I  have a friend that's related to our herione I know!) I do give it 2 stars  for the music though, that was pretty good.
B000000OTU|5.0|What a cool album!  That's what I have to say about Big Ones by Aerosmith.  This is an awesome album and one of the few greatest hits albums that  actually has all of the greatest and best hits by Aerosmith.  I just love  all of the songs but probably my favorites are: Livin' On The Edge, Cryin',  Janie's Got A Gun, Dude (Looks Like A Lady), Crazy, and Love In An  Elevator.  Of course, all the rest are great too.  This is definitely my  favorite Aerosmith album.      Steven Tyler's voice is amazing.  The way  that he sings is remarkable.  He's a true inspiration to a lot of people.   Let me just say that if you buy this album and you truly do not like it at  all, you've got problems.  BUY THIS ALBUM AND LISTEN TO IT  EVERYDAY!
B00003ZA0T|5.0|i have listened to this album. well i have listened to it about 300 times,  i never get bored with it, and i think that slipknot have take me into  metal. after listening to slipknot, i have got into kittie, korn, and loads  more! its great! I think that any metal fan should have this album, and any  punk fan should listen to it, it might get you into metal! like it did to  me! wahey!
B000006ZL4|5.0|This album is without doubt one the milestones in the Hard Rock/Heavy  Metal genre. Every track is a masterpiece.<br />  Unlike other progressive  bands, you don't have to be a muscician to appreciate Symphony X. They  simply write great songs. Catchy and very, very heavy.

B000002JS6|5.0|After re-discovering this band with 1990 The Razors Edge, I dusted off this album (picked up in a bargain bin about four years ago) and gave it  another listen.  This time I've learned to disregard the very mindless  nature of AC/DC's lyrics and simply listen to the guitars, and I was quite  stirred.  Beneath the party-band stylings lie darker touches:  The ringing,  signature riff of &quot;Hells Bells&quot; is almost melancholy, and  &quot;Back in Black&quot; may be a classic anthem for headbangers, but  there's an aggression in the way Brian Johnson's shouted vocals interact  with the Young brothers' grinding power chords that suggests something more  than just an energized romp.  But it *was* &quot;You Shook Me All Night  Long&quot; that became the band's biggest pop hit, a feel-good riff monster  that became the album's flagship.<br />I believe that AC/DC could have  retained its bare-bones basic approach to rock and roll without sacrificing  the lyrical front the way it has throughout its whole career.  But when  Malcolm and Angus Young start pounding those catchy guitar riffs, I find it  easy to overlook the faults.
B00000JCOV|5.0|After listening to this album for five or ten minutes, you'll die. This is  so wonderfully loud, aggressive, rude, vulgar, hyper, heavy, sick, awesome.  Slipknot is awesome. Check this album out.
B0000025YW|5.0|I'd never heard of Accept until about two years ago, and even then, it's a  band name that nobody ever mentions.  I had no idea what the band's music  sounds like aside from the scant reviews I've read of Accept's  catalogue.<br />Balls to the Wall was supposedly one of the band's best  records so I took a blind stab at it -- and was surprised at how  sophisticated-sounding a record this was, given the bad initial impression  that the dumb title gave me.  And true, Accept can create a party groove as  well as AC/DC, but Accept also succeeds in actually writing meaningful  lyrics to go along with its loud ethic.  The result is a singularly  impressive metal record that somehow became a lost gem, known to many  headbangers and guitar players, but rarely played.  But it's very  impressive hard rock:  &quot;Head over Heels&quot; and &quot;Fight It  Back&quot; features some of the hottest guitar work I remember hearing, the  only complaint being a mix that doesn't quite favour the electric guitars  enough, and on &quot;London Leatherboys&quot; and &quot;Balls to the  Wall&quot; lead singer Udo Dirkschneider sounds like a cross between Bon  Scott and Brian Johnson with his psychotic yells, which sound perfectly in  place given the rough-and-tumble backdrop his excellent band (I single out  guitarists Wolf Hoffman and Hermann Frank and bassist Peter Balter for  praise) provides.  Old-school metal has never sounded so good -- count me  as a new, satisfied convert of Accept's.
6305696071|1.0|I'll never understand all the praise for a movie who's basic premise seems  to be as follows:<br />A) All women are prostitutes at heart B) All women need  to be rescued by rich men<br />Sounds pretty shallow to me.
B000002JNN|4.0|For years I couldn't reconcile myself to AC/DC's sexist, mallet-headed lyrics and party-hearty antics, but this album helped win me over.  Mind  you, the boys can't write anything verbally meaningful to save their lives,  but the scorching guitars and adrenalin fly through the air like sweat  beads at a concert.  Lead track &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; features some of  Angus Young's best lead-guitar work ever, &quot;Moneytalks&quot; is  memorable radio metal, and &quot;Are You Ready&quot; does what AC/DC does  best -- fist-pumping party anthems with lean, mean guitars and attitude.
6305171769|4.0|I think this movie was ok. It was not the best but it is still very scary and great for any halloween fans,And one of the questions is...is michale  dead?  Your sure convinced that hes dead but I guess will just have to find  out in the next Halloween movie....Halloween-H2K:evil never dies.
0812550706|5.0|This is one of the most powerful and riveting books I have ever come across. If you enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, fiction, mystery, or dramatic  readings, then you will enjoy this book. Card employs so many different  techniques and his book touches on so many levels it truly is amazing more  people have not read it. Don't be put off by it's sci-fi nature. The book  is so much more.<br />While this book cvertainly is an excellent way to  encourage children to pick up reading, they will be highly disapointed with  the sequels to this book. This is the first of a series that goes into a  deeper sense of moral dilemma and can only really begun to be appreciated  by a young adult reader. However, if you are just looking for ane xciting  sci-fi futuristic read involving real-world video games, then this is the  book for you.<br />If you are looking for a powerful series depicting the  powerful feelings that any person has to deal with in this cold and cruel  world and the choices that we make, and how they may seem good at 1 time  may seem evil and unecessary at another time, then this is the series for  you.

B00000JCB2|4.0|Well, I must say that I really like this band, tough I also have to say that this band could improve a lot as well. First of all, Fred Durst is  such a lame singer, and is also horrible writing lyrics. Obviously, he is  not a musician, you can tell that from the way he sings. I also dont know  why the have a DJ with them, but for sure he must be happy, since hes  earning his wage doing practically nothing. Also, another non musician  here. But, the rest of the guys have studied, and you can tell that, the  bass in Re - Arranged is great. The drummer also plays a tempo which is non  usual, sounds like a breath of fresh air. Wes doesnt have that talent,  hes not an obviously talented musician (Wes, quit playing octaves on every  single song!  And, by the way, B is not the only note to write a  song! ), but I must say that he plays in a very unique way, hes sort of  a Tom Morello without the talent. But, he manages to sound really good in  songs like Nookie, and specially in Break Stuff. The best part of the album  is the first half, which is worth buying it, in fact, Re - Arranged has to  be the song of 1999, is excellent. Of course, its easy to criticize, when  you are not the person qho recorded the album, but, Im from the old metal  wave, from Pantera, Megadeth, Metallica, etc, and this new metal wave like  Korn and Limp is good, but, only as an alternative to the old good Pantera.  Buy it, anyway, Re - arranged, Just like this, Nookie, and Break Stuff   will pay the price.
1558908382|4.0|This movie just keeps me laughing.  John Cusack plays Martin Blank, a  hitman who goes to his 10 year high school reunion, and to whack someone  when he gits the time. Cusack has his same low tone reserved whit that  makes you think as much as it makes you laugh, but the supporting cast is  the clincher. Dan Aykroyd is gut wrenchingly funny as a fellow hitman  looking to form a union and Joan Cusack steals the show as Martin's  neurotic secretary. Minnie Driver even manages to hold her own in a comedy.  The movie is a five star comedy and the music is classic. I do have to  agree with previous reviewers in that I was dissapointed that this DVD had  no extras worth mentioning. Its still worth adding to your video  collection.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I'm a guitarist, and a heavy metal lover. Under both circumstances, I will  review this album. I believe there must not be such a talented guistarist  as dime, who writes solos while he is jamming, and plays always drunk, but  accurate. This album has songs which are incredible, like Cowboys From  hell, Domination, The Sleep, Heresy, The Art of Shredding, and Cemetery  Gates, which is probably the best song ever (and not only speaking of  Metal). The riffs here are incredibly heavy, and tight. Also, the  distortion is unbeliavable. Dimebag's brother, Vinnie Paul, plays drumm  very well, is very good, lacks a little bit of sensitivity, but, that's of  course not a big problem. Anselmo's best vocals are to be found in this  album, from this point on, his voice was going to get really awful, as well  as the rest of Pantera's albums, I mean, this is their best album. Vulgar  also worths a buy. However, if you like heavy metal (the real thing, not  Korn) get this album right now, it as good as Countdown To Extinction or  Rust In Peace (Megadeth), or as Muster of Puppets or ...And Justice For All  (Metallica). After Cowboys from hell, metal wouldn't be the same anymore...
014028009X|5.0|being nasty to all those free-wheeling, fun loving singletons! as a smug  married, i never thought that seeing myself through another point of view  would be so damn frank, and endlessly touching. bridget, with her 30 ish,  lonely, excessively dieting self is a woman of her own, with a line of  vision comparable to pretty much anyone. i loved this book, and will, in  the future buy anything related to ms jones, and wont be so smug...
B00000J7J4|5.0|Santana contacts some of his creative artistic friends to create a  beautiful CD. Santana created the music then gave his artist friends the  challenge to finish the song with words.<br />This CD evokes passion and fun  which is missing in music today!<br />BRAVO Santana!
6302548195|5.0|This is a great film.... (ITALIAN LANGUAGE) Questo è il miglior film mai  proiettato!!! W Arnold e i suoi bicipiti da favola.. (great biceps)  è un  vero peccato che queso film non sia piu' in commercio.<br />Do u no if exists  an italian version of it? thanks...<br />Gabriele...
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is the type of movie you have to sit down and pay 100% ATTENTION to the plot, overwise, you will miss the entire plot. A GREAT MOVIE with GREAT  ACTORS!  Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors.
B00003CWPR|2.0|I don't know what I was expecting when I saw this movie, but whatever it was I don't think I got it. This movie wasn't pornography by any means,  although sex is clearly a central theme. Tom Cruise's character always  seems to be on the verge of having sex or exploring different sexual  practices.  That much I enjoyed, but my God this movie dragged. Painfully  slow in most scenes, Eyes Wide Shut had me looking at the timer on my DVD  player most of the time. This is no slight on the acting performances by  Cruise and Kidman who are both quite good, it's more the creative aspect.  The writing is dull; the music adds no drama or suspense but lulls you to  sleep; and the scenery is overly stuffy. Maybe I was expecting something  much greater since this was a Kubrick film, but no matter who directed it  there is no excuse for a movie that nearly puts someone to sleep.
B00000J6AG|5.0|If you like to relax. If you like to dance. If you like to imagine. If you  like to giggle. Then this CD is for you. It's technical with simple values.  PLAY is one of my favorite CD's. The only thing better than this CD is  seeing Moby live. :-)
B000002N2P|3.0|Everybodys heard of Green Day, you know the band your average punk rocker loves to hate, because they got famous and &quot;sold out.&quot;  Insomniac is Green Day doing what they do best, which is catchy pop/punk songs with  attitude.  &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot; was actually a radio hit at one  time and it never gets old, however, with the exception of tracks like  &quot;86&quot; and &quot;Stuart and the Ave&quot; the rest of this CD can  get boring and repetative very quick.  Insomniac has its moments, but its  not Green Day's best album.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers continue to grow musically. The history of the  band is amazing as well as their music. Buy this CD and enjoy it time and  time again!
B00003CWTI|1.0|This movie ranks as one of the biggest failures ever. After sitting through 2.5 hours of helter skelter excitement, I turned to my wife, and  said &quot;This movie could now end a million different ways&quot;. I think  any one of these million ways would have been OK- But the makers of this  movie chose number 1,000,001. The entire frog thing is someone on the  director or producer seat with a drug fantasy, or perhaps they wanted to  laugh at the silly people like me who rented it. Unless you revel in the  absurd, please don't waste your time.
B00003Q43A|5.0|A good movie, well produced, great actors. It's a must see. A movie for  the whole family.
B000002NIW|5.0|Chino Moreno found his bucket of gold in this masterpiece.   Just about  the only thing wrong with this CD is the fact that most of the songs are  unremarkably badly titled.                Reason you ask?  Possibly because  of Chino's remarkably different style of songwriting,  or possibly because  the titles of many of the songs on this CD have next to nothing to do with  the songs. A blur indeed,  but at 10 songs  [11 with the hidden song],   this is a blitzkrieg of emotional-metal that takes the Blue Ribbon for most  innovative of its genre,  and some of the best 11 songs that every fan  should have in their collection.
B00003CXCS|5.0|with the sound of music! This is a classic movie. Every parent should buy this cd for their kids.<br />If only musicals would come back. :-)
B000001FYL|5.0|this is the first cd I ever bought for myself and by myself. It was a long  time ago and I had to look two months for it. I'm now buying my second copy  'cause the first one is worn to the bone. This is by far my all time  favourite cd. Wherever I go, it's with me. The songs are beautiful and  heart-rending and just great to roar along with. For me, this the ultimate  and eternal classic. An excellent buy!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is very violent. If you can get past the violence then you will love this movie. As any other review, I won't reveal the plot because that  would ruin it. trust me and get the movie and enjoy!
B000007686|5.0|WOW, if you're an ABBA love or even just a music lover this CD is great  for you. It's got harmony beond anything you'll ever hear. It's up tempo  style and funk is amazing. plus they're comming back cause everyone  realized they were so great! if you want to be the cool person with the  great music taste buy this CD or if you just love music! It's got something  for every body ! MAMA MIA! that's a great song!
B00003CX95|5.0|A love story with blood and guts. I cried and my husband said, &quot;wow, what a great movie&quot;. A great movie to watch on a date or home with  friends.<br />this movie is very violent.
0780631684|5.0|Everyone has heard of Jason, Freddie, and even the Leprechaun.  Each of these kinds of horror movies centered around one person killing many other  people.  Although the killers are different, the source of the fear is  always the same...death.  Death may come in the form of a teenager in a  ghost mask, or a fisherman with a hook, but in Final Destination we see  death for what it really is...death.  The writers of Final Destination  cleaverly made the killer an unseen force that cannot be stoped.  The  killer is not someone who dresses like his mother and kills Jamie Lee  Curtis's mother in the shower, but instead the killer is a series of  strange coincidences that results in the death of a person.  Since there is  no killer to be seen, the death scenes are very elaborate and incredibly  smart. This movie is the first original horror movie since Psycho.
B00003CWOL|5.0|A must watch movie.  I'd love to be in a Kevin Smith movie (one of my  dreams)
6305205620|5.0|Great DVD by a band of millionares. Seriously, great production and sound.  A must for anyone who is still a fan of the band.
6305807086|5.0|This is one of those movies that you lose yourself in. Look through  someone elses eyes. Feel what another is feeling. Wanting to be a man  because the feeling of being a man feels soooo good intrigues me. A Great  Movie!
080018789X|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I was moved by the story.  The second  time I watched it, I was amazed by the acting.  The third time, I was  impressed by the cinematography.  Well, you get the picture.  This film has  so much to offer, that it might be impossible to fully appreciate it after  only one viewing.  I have seen it numerous times, and I notice something  new each time.  At the heart of this film lies the story of a man who  transforms his life because he doesn't have the most important thing: inner  happiness.  Everybody can identify with Jerry at some point in his  metamorphosis from a commercialized business machine to a loving family  man.  The movie leaves you feeling good about people and yourself.  So  don't miss out on this one, you'll be happy you saw it.  I know I am.
B00000K19E|5.0|The best advantage of this dvd is being able to see the behind the scenes  footage. To see the story boards and the ability to understand the  concepts. This is a movie that have further progressed the advancement of  cinematography (sp). A great futuristic movie.
B000001F2H|4.0|I had this Album (oh, that dates me) and I do recall it did  turn me onto  what we now fondly call the British blues. Clapton as well as the rhythm  section propelled John Mayall above the constellation as we know it.<br />If  anything, it's great listening for those who want to hear how great Clapton  was in his youth (and still is).<br />I recommend trying the true blues  artists instead of these british copies, like Muddy Waters, Albert King,  Johnny Copeland and others.
B00001NFCY|5.0|The lead singer of Creed is HOT!!!! When looking into this guys eyes....  the music is WOW! Like I said, it's a girls perspective (giggle)
0060194995|5.0|I was assigned to read To Kill a Mockingbird in 8th grade.  It was a thick book with small letters and I was dreading it.  I decided to watch the  movie first.  This is not a good idea in most cases but I loved it so much  I wanted to read the book.  I found that the book was just as good as the  movie.  It contained much more detail but was interesting through and  through.  <br />I think everyone should read this book.  It's situations are  so true even of the world today.  It has been three years since I first  read it and I have enjoyed it many times since then.  <br />This was the only  book Harper Lee ever wrote.  She said that it contained all she wanted to  say.  Any book containing all of someone's ideas is worthy of our  attention.
0312243022|5.0|The Hours is great literature.  It is beautifully written.  One should  follow reading this book with Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf.  One can  understand what he is trying to accomplish and it makes reading Woolf that  much easier.  It deserved to win the Pulitzer Prize.
B00004RF9B|5.0|The DVD I received had the letterbox format on one side and the full  screen version on the other. French and English audio and English, French,  and Spanish subtitles/closed-captioning.
6305878323|4.0|The movie is definitely 5 stars to me and my family.  However, videophile  beware, this new gold collection release is advertised here as widescreen  anamorphic, however it is actually the same letterboxed version previously  released, with a few extras.  The keepcase does not claim to be anamorphic  (enhanced for widescreen TVs, etc.) So those of you with a widescreen TV,  don't be disappointed.
B000000OEI|3.0|If you liked the film, this is an excellent choice for you.  Zimmer is one  of the greatest at setting a mood and heightening tension, and this CD  certainly does that.  You may not sit down and just listen to the whole  thing straight through, but use it for background while you work, read, or  drive, and you will truly appreciate it.  Especially notable is Zimmer's  arrangement of the beautiful Navy Hymn, used several times on this disc.   The only drawback is the length of the tracks, but when you're passing  everything on the freeway, you won't even notice.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Excellent Songs of freedom.You can find a rare songs on those cd's.Must  have for every music fan.ONE LOVE.
630528069X|5.0|Die Hard has taken its place among the modern classics. Plot, characterization, musical score... everything is there. Bruce Willis is the  resourceful but outmatched hero; Alan Rickman is the ideal villain, with an  intelligence and adaptability that many screenwriters strive to produce but  few achieve. So much ground has been covered by other reviews that there's  no point praising the movie further.<br />The DVD edition, however, is  amazing. I've watched Die Hard pan-and-scan for so many years that when I  finally saw it widescreen there was just so much more to see. I'm amazed  not just at how well widescreen (and DVD's sound quality) enhanced the  movie, but at what was missing before. The panning was badly done in the  original VHS version, hiding important things unnecessarily. (When Al first  enters the building, for example, and walks down the hallway, there is an  arm holding a machine gun ready to shoot him if he goes further. This is  not visible in the standard version, not because both figures wouldn't fit  in the frame but because the panning was just that poor.)<br />DVD sound makes  its mark on the movie in a big way when the office chair loaded with C-4  detonates. The special features are decent as well, making this more than  just a movie-and-trailer DVD. If you liked the movie in VHS--or if you've  never seen it and would like a good action DVD--don't pass this one up.
B00000BKI4|3.0|Well I have to say this album was a surprise. Rather than move off into  the rock scene any further 'mercury rev' seem to have setteled down a bit.  The songs on this CD were a lot different to the stuff on their other  albums.  For a start all the music is really quite, it's not really loud  head banging stuff or anything, you'd even have trouble dancing to it. The  song's hold more meaning and are at a higher level than most other bands of  there era. I really enjoyed the song &quot;she's a goddess&quot; and think  that this is by far the best song on the CD, compared to this the other  songs on the CD are average. For any fan's, this will be a good one to your  collection. If you don't know what mercury rev are all about I would  recomend one of their other albums first for the simple reason it will give  you more of an idea about their music.
6305892946|5.0|This movie was really good.  I personally wished that Kevin Williamson  would have wrote the script.  But it stayed within the usual scream-worthy  plot.  This movie gives you a look at some darker chapters of Sidney's  mom's past; which lead to the brilliant ending.  If you liked the first 2  fillms you must see this final chapter to the trilogy.  So snuggle up with  your popcorn and watch this great film!
B000000Y1H|5.0|An all-star line-up often rather disappoints than fulfills your  expectation. That these recordings will satisfy you flawlessly is simply  due to the fact that nobody would or could have expected music like this.  After a whole decade of ignorance and discrimination, in the fall of 1956  Monk was finally given the chance to record an album consisting of own  compositions with the best musicians available. And the courageous  high-priest of modern music knew how to take the occasion. He wrote three  completely new compositions, of which the title piece is so ambitious and  tricky - yet so swinging - that few people dared to approach it in the  future, including Monk whose remake with  Oliver Nelson's Big band is a  faint shadow of the masterpiece you can hear on this CD.Everything fits,the  virtuosos assembled here were stars of their own virtue but they all  execute Monk's music in a rewardingly unselfish manner. And rewarded you'll  be as a listener, let alone by Sonny Rollins' solo on the opening track.
0671034065|5.0|I thought Mr perfect was a great book and that the main character was a  departure from other weak willed simpering women we see in most novels.  jaine bright and her three friend work for a computer company and they are  fed up with the men at work and in there lives. so they make a list of the  perfect man as a joke . but thelist gets spread around and thats when the  trouble starts. I like the character of jaine she has a potty mouth, shes  brave and not afraid to stand up for her self and a great sense of humor.  sam was just perfect for her . I enjoyed this book !
6302182530|5.0|While the story of Sinbad's pursuit of a hidden treasure amidst seemingly  insurmountable danger, falling in love with a beautiful woman (thank Allah  that polygamy was allowed, no? He seems to get married in each film!) and  being pursued by evil, magickal forces has become \\"stock\\" in that  they all are basically the same tale, this film is truly exemplary for the  acting talent of Thom Baker (spelled Tom in this flick), memorable to most  of us as the \\"best\\" of the Dr. Who characters. Baker brings an  intelligent, almost tragic malevolence to the character of Prince Koura,  master swordsman and sorcerer, whose pursuit of arcane and mundane power  comes at a very tangible and foreknown cost (he ages whenever he casts a  major spell of any sort). In short, you certainly sympathise with him and  sometimes almost secretly hope he is successful, since he really has no  choice BUT to once he sets out on the path. Again, like all Sinbad films,  the scenery is astounding, the special effects (Ray Harryhausen) remarkable  even in this day and age of computer graphics, and the story replete with  kitsch (pardon the pun) references to Islam.
B00004R99K|5.0|Alice in Wonderland is a nice little adaption of the Lewis Carrol classic.  With the fast paced plot and great characters, it is one of my favorite  animated movies of all time. Don't hesitate to buy it, whether you have  kids or not, whether you're a Disney fanatic or you've never heard of  Mickey Mouse. Trust me, you'll like it!
B000001EKX|4.0|Not KISS's best but still is good. Parasite, Hotter Than Hell, and Got To  Choose are the best, but the debut is better. Would later do better with  Destroyer - Love Gun.
B000000WA4|4.0|this album proves that the smashing pumpkins would be around a while which  they were. the best songs on thes double disk album is tonight,tonight  which is the best, 1979 is great to, stumbleine is great as well, bullet  with butterfly wings is also one of there best. many of the other songs on  here are only average to not that great but the 10 or so that are good  makes you want this cd.
B000001EL7|5.0|I Stole Your Love, Christeen Sixteen, Shock Me, Love Gun, Plaster Caster. There isn't a bad note on the entire album! My all-time favorite, to me it  reigns over Destroyer, KISS, Dressed To Kill, Alive!, and Rock N Roll Over!  Also KISS does a wicked version of &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot; turning it  into &quot;Then She Kissed Me&quot;. The last great KISS album is an  &quot;ABSOLUTE&quot; Must Have!  Buy!
1878424319|5.0|The simple revelations in this book have irrevocably changed my life, how  I view the events that pass before me and how I see myself.  While going  through a difficult period in my life, at first I did not understand the  logic behind &quot;Don't take things personally&quot;.  I thought, 'these  things I take personally happened to me; they affected me immensely and  were done by someone dear to me'.  However, after reading further I  realized what this really meant and the power this statement has if put to  use.  I now see the clarity and feel the serenity of this statement.  I  wish I had read this book years ago (although I wonder if it would have  sunk in then!).  This is a short book, but don't try to rush through it on  the plane or during your lunch break.  You need to take time to consider  what you are learning and how it applies to your life (past, present, and  future).  I hope it gives others the same sense of love and peace it has  given me.
B00000IBRX|5.0|If you have an interest in fantasy, romance, imagination, originality,  emotion and the spiritual realm then you will love this movie! This is a  beautiful love story about two soulmates, Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie  (Annabella Sciorra).  Tragically, they lose both of their children in a car  accident. Soon afterwards, Chris dies in a car accident as well, leaving  Annie alone bereaved.  Chris comes back, in the Spirit, to try and comfort  his wife.  She can not see or hear him...or can she?<br />After much suffering  over her loss, Annie commits suicide.  Chris is happy when he is told in  his own private paradise.  But there is a problem.  Annie went to hell  because she &quot;violated the natural order of her journey.&quot;  Chris  responds to the terrible news with &quot;I'm her soulmate, I can find  her.&quot;  When told he does not understand he replies &quot;it is not  about understanding! It's about NOT giving up!&quot; Chris is determined to  find Annie no matter what the cost. &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; is  beautiful from start to finish but Chris' search is what touched me the  most. This movie is about agape love--love so pure that it transcends  reason or consequence.  Follow Chris through a journey into the heart of  love.<br />This is Robin Williams in one of his best dramatic performances;  a must-have for any fan of his.  Annabella Sciorra is a wonderful actress  and she and Robin successfully portray soulmates.  The script is one of the  best I've ever heard, full of beautiful thought-provoking lines (such as  the title above.)  The cinematography and set design are absolutely  stunning--an astounding Heaven and Hell are depicted better than I've seen  in countless other movies. The soundtrack is deeply moving as well.<br />I  highly and whole-heartedly recommend this movie!

B00004RGUU|5.0|This is my second favorite movie.  It's funny, yet touching and it really  makes you fall in love with Butch and Sundance and you find yourself  rooting for the two-bit outlaws.  this movie is very well done.  I've read  books about the duo and have done a report on them and I'd say the movie is  pretty accurate but still great!
B00004RFCM|5.0|I am a twenty 24 years old and recently engaged. I absolutely love this program and look forward to it each week.  I started watching Sex and the  City a few months ago, but recently purchased the DVD collection to catch  up on the first season. I feel as if I am completely addicted and can't get  enough. I thoroughly enjoy watching these women. I find the topics of sex,  dating, and relationships to be so right on and feel that many times I can  relate to these women and their lives. I highly recommend the show to any  women who needs a good laugh. Words cannot explain the true brilliance of  the show.
B000000I3O|5.0|The Misfits are probably one of the best bands to ever walk the face of  the planet.  With great guitar hooks and a mad pop genius to their  melodies, they took punk/metal to a new level.  This is one of the best  collections of their early output with original vocalist Glenn Danzig.  I  can't say there are any bad songs on this CD.  Listen to it a few times and  it becomes addicting.  It's a snapshot from a time that can never be  relived.  A must-own for any horrorkid, and if you don't know who the  Misfits are and what they do, then you need to hear this and &quot;walk  among us&quot;.  Catch the new line-up (with Michale Graves on vocals) live  if you can.  I've seen them 3 times and they devastate anything in their  path.  We are 138!
0783241569|3.0|OK, so &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is a sweet movie.  The scenery and music  all blends in so well with it, in fact too well that we soon forget about  the story, which was too slow.  I didn't see much chemistry between Julia  and Hugh, and not enough convincing was done to see how they fell in love  and why they needed each other.  The other casts were really the ones who  made this film going, and I guess that's how it was able to hold on for two  hours where it was kind of wrapped up too neatly and too predictably.  If  you're looking for this kind of stuff,though, then this movie is perfect  for you.
0688170528|5.0|I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. The flasbacks are  appropiatley placed and gives us a deeper look as to how Chris and Em  evolved from friends to lovers. It is definatley a page turner and the  ending both surprised and pleased me.
6303114946|5.0|This movie will hit close to home with just about anybody. It's about a  boy coming of age, a father wanting his son to be the best he can be, and  their relationship together. Once the father (Joe Mantegna) realizes his  son has a gift for playing chess, he decides to get the boy a tutor(Ben  Kingsley). What was once enjoyable for the boy, quickly turns into a chore.  The boy learns from two teachers, his tutor, and a street wise  hustler(Played well by Laurence Fishbourne) who also has a passion for the  game. The boy just wants to be loved. By the end of the movie every  charachter has learned a lesson, some way or another. The supporting cast  includes William H. Macy, Dan Hedaya, and David Paymer. This movie is not  just about chess, it's about relationships. In short, it is a must see!
B000002UZ1|1.0|First, let it be said that biased people should not be allowed to review albums on Amazon (see July 19th). That said, even those Beatle fans with  blind faith will admit that songs like &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;,  &quot;Ballad of John &amp; Yoko&quot;, &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; and  &quot;Across the Universe&quot; are closer to the bottom of the heap than  the top, and certainly should have been moved aside in favor of other  tracks. Buy Abbey Road and even the sleep-inducing White Album if you must,  but skip this unless you want a sampling of their worst work. 1-star.
6303855512|5.0|Smoke performs a rare feat. It captivates you, and takes you on a journey.  It does this without much action. This is an actors movie, Wang leaves it  to the performers to move the story along. No special effects, or  uneccessary action sequences here. Just down to earth charachters with  flaws. The story intertwines these charachters, and we learn each of their  sad stories and regrets. From Paul(William Hurt)a novelist who lost his  passion, to Auggie(Harvey Keitel) a tobbaco store owner who wades through  life each day. You and I know these kind of people.We see them in  restaurants, on the bus, and everywhere else we go. Smoke not only is a joy  too watch, but it provides a valuable lesson as well. The realization that  everyone has their own story to tell.
B000002BSV|4.0|When I first pressed the 'play' button, I was really quite astounded at  how good this album was. This astonishment continued until the middle of  the second side of the album, when things appeared to fall to pieces.  However, the album finishes on a high with 'Saturday Night.' The best  tracks on here have got to be 'Trash', 'Lazy' and 'Beautiful Ones' If  you're a Suede fan, it's definately worth it, if not, it's a relatively  good starting point.
B000002I7H|5.0|A physically imposing man, Albert King produced blues of uncommon vitality  and power. His sound is well represented in this strong sampling of his  work on Stax.<br />Every blues singer, male or female, living or dead, of any  note developed a unique vocal style, and Albert is no exception. His  drawl-like phrasings and frequent spoken asides (as on &quot;Cold  Feet&quot;) place a strong personal stamp on these tunes. My personal vocal  favorites are &quot;Landromat Blues,&quot; the aforementioned &quot;Cold  Feet,&quot; the often-recorded &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman,&quot; and &quot;You  Sure Drive a Hard Bargain.&quot;<br />Then there's &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot;  his ode to his guitar. While you might be tempted to dismiss it as a copy  cat version of B.B. King's &quot;Lucille,&quot; don't make that mistake.  Naming guitars is a long-time tradition, and Albert's tune is as different  from B.B.'s as the two great bluesmen's guitar and vocal styles are. Both  men can make their guitars cry, but the sound of tears and laughter come  from two different women.<br />Oddly enough, I downgrade the CD version  slightly from the original vinyl -- not enough to change my overall  assessment of the release, but the added material could be stronger. Of the  six bonus tracks, I consider only the mournful &quot;As the Years Go  Passing By&quot; a significant addition to the package. Stax would have  been very well advised, I think, to leave off, in particular, &quot;The  Very Thought of You,&quot; a great tune, obviously, but not one that is up  Albert's alley.<br />Nonetheless, you'll have a great time with &quot;King of  the Blues Guitar.&quot; Albert will get a lot of argument about that  assessment, but there's no question that he's a member of blues royalty.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I just bought this Cd and whenever I put it in my cd player the songs from  automatically caught my attention cause they have a great message.  I think  that in some of the songs they have a great christian message to it and I  think that they should continue the good work.  I haven't really got to  listen to &quot;My Own Prison&quot; but I heard that it is awsome  also!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000003S0Z|5.0|This is about as abstract as rock music ever got. Brian Eno had released another white-knuckle progressive rock album - this probably being his best  work - at the same time the sycophantic journalists at NME were beating the  drum for punk. (So The Clash exemplified British poverty better than the  Pistols and could play circles around their contemporaries? Isn't that kind  of like being the tallest midget in the circus?) Well, Brian Eno had just  invented a new genre of music (ambient); he had just finished working with  David Bowie on 'Heroes' and 'Low', and more recently, moved into remarkably  sophisticated krautrock terrain on 'Before and After Science'. Yet boring  charlatans like Sid Vicious managed to steal the spotlight.<br /> This is  it: the most exiting album ever released. Buy it and watch your false teeth  fly across the room in joy.
6305897786|1.0|I went into this movie expecting a supernatural thriller steeped in the occult.  What I got was a guy wandering around Europe looking at a couple  of books and trying to figure out why people are trying to kill him.   Nothing really supernatural about it.<br />Johnny Depp and Frank Langella both  put in excellent acting jobs.  Unfortunately, they weren't enough to save  this film.  Slow pacing and an unrealized potential dragged this movie into  the category of &quot;Why did I just waste 2 and a half hours watching  this?&quot;  I was expecting demonic conjurings and encounters with  supernatural beings, but those never happened.  The major problem I had  with it was the fact that none of the mysteries were ever explained,  especially the mysterious woman following Depp's character around and  saving his life.  What was her story?<br />All in all, I found it quite a  boring movie.  The theme was interesting, but the potential of the film was  definitely not met.  This movie could have been so much better, but ended  up leaving me disappointed.
4789007758|5.0|I found this book while living in Japan, and it became my prime book for studying Japanese. My Japanese host father used this book just as much to  study english--the example sentences and translations are incredibly  natural and original.  After my year in Japan, I went to the University of  Washington and was lucky enough to take a Technical Japanese class with  Professor Tsutsui. He was an incredible instructor, and this book reflects  that.<br />This book is arranged like an encylopedia, with two to four pages  dedicated to explaining each grammatical structure. Samples include 'sore  ni', 'totan', 'zaru o enai', and 'kara to itte'. What is also very useful  is the appendix, which includes all sorts of goodies such as compound verbs  and particles. Although it all sounds as boring as the word 'grammar'  itself, this book really makes it interesting.<br />I recommend this book for  any ambitious student of Japanese at about a 3rd to 4th-year level.  Furigana readings are attached to most Kanji, but there is very little  romaji. There is also another companion book, which is by the same authors  and covers basic Japanese grammer.
078324228X|4.0|In this movie, Denzel Washington gives us another brilliant performance in  his portrayal of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter.  He gives the  character dignity and integrity, even while in prison for a murder he  didn't commit.  The actor who played Lesra also did a very good job in his  portrayal of a young black kid trying to find his identity.<br />Although I  have never read the book and don't know anything about the actual story, I  thought the story told in the movie was brilliantly done.  The flashbacks  and flashforwards were effective in engaging the viewer in The Hurricane's  story.  The one shortcoming in the film was the very short court scenes.  I  would have liked to seen more of that, including both his initial trial and  the federal court where he was set free.  I would also have liked to see  some of his second trial, even if this would have made the movie three  hours long.  As it is, I thought this was a very enjoyable movie.  If you  liked Denzel in GLORY, MALCOM X, and HE GOT GAME, you'll love him here.  This is also a must see for any drama fan.  Very well done!
0671034065|5.0|yes this book is a mystery/thriller, yes its a romance with hot steamy  love scenes, but what I really liked about the book was the wicked sense of  humor Ms. Howard has shown herself to have.  I am a new and now devoted  reader. I laughted till I though I would cry.  there is a part where Jaine  and Sam talk about Jaine's egg. I had to back up and read it again, I  laughted so hard. Some of the readers are complaining about Jaine and Sam  getting together so quickly, hey guys remember its fiction, your just  suppose to enjoy!  Most books unless their fact, and sometimes those, have  parts of them someone finds hard to believe.  Ms. Howard please keep  writing.  By the way I owe you a quarter, this was a HELL of a good book.   I am eagerly waiting for your new one.  Your are now a favorite of mine and  a keeper.
0767903854|5.0|Since I live in Bill Bryson's place of birth (Des Moines, Iowa), I feel a  certain connection to him.  Having disclosed my bias, I really loved this  book.  I found myself laughing out loud in several spots.  Particularly  when describing any number of ways a person could be poisoned by some  member of the Austrailian animal kingdom.  There are also several poignant  moments, especially when he describes the plight of the Aboriginies.   <br />This book is more than just a travel memoir.  It's a journey of history,  social studies, adventure, but most of all it is truly an entertaining  ride.  This book is a must read for all.
080017948X|5.0|This is one the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Without giving away  too much of the plot, I will tell you why. Pessimistic Phil Connors,  weatherman on Channel 9 Pittsburgh finds himself once again in the tiny  town of Punxsatawney, PA for-what else- Groundhog Day. On Groundhog Day, an  unpredicted blizzard keeps Phil (like the groundhog), the funny cameraman  Larry, and the new producer, Rita, in Punxsatawney. The next day he wakes  up in his hotel room and finds out that it's <br />                GROUNDHOG  DAY!<br />          It is amazingly funny to see Phil reapeat Groundhog Day  over and over and over again, and for him there seems to be no way out of  it, whether he tries to save an old man's life, drives off of a cliff, or  tries-unsuccesfully, I might add- to make Rita love him.<br />                 GET THE MOVIE, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000009HF2|4.0|For those of you with a hearing problem from going to too many of these  shows back in the 70's, the lyrics at the end of &quot;Do you feel like we  do&quot; go &quot;I want to thank you&quot; and &quot;Good Night&quot;. I  don't think PF was saying &quot;I want to F you&quot; and &quot;Loose  joints&quot;, which is what someone I knew was conviced of, but you never  know! <br />Anyway, one of the best Live albums ever. Talk Box is awsome, I'm  predicting a comeback of this device. Where can I get one?
0385040253|5.0|The Ashley Book of Knots is an encyclopedic tome on knots -- It's huge,  it's very well organised, it's very useful and a lot of fun. <br />My  favourites are the Chinese button knots. I've never seen a more complete  compilation of these beautiful knots. I've asked many Chinese, Japanese,  Vietnamese and Koreans, and they haven't seen as many differet knots  either. Second favourites are Turk's Head knots. Again -- an excruciatingly  complete compilation, very beautiful pictures and very clear diagrams. Get  the book and have fun!
B00003CWRX|5.0|A movie about a whistle blower in a giant tobacco firm and a producer from  60 Minutes?!  Wake me up when it's over.  I'm sure that's what you're  thinking.  I know its what I was thinking.  But then I noticed that this  was a Michael Mann film, and after &quot;Heat&quot;, I'll follow him  anywhere.<br />I beleive myself to be a true fan of film.  It excites me.  I  want to care about the characters and what happens to them.  I want to be  visually enticed by the beauty of its photography.  I want to have a  reaction to a snappy line of a dialogue.  I have rarely been as satisfied  as I was upon walking out of &quot;The Insider.&quot;<br />The words  &quot;high drama&quot; sum it up perfectly.  I was on the edge of my seat  watching this film.  Russel Crowe delivers a superb performance.  His  silence.  His struggle.  His furrowed brow.  He was so subtle and so  commanding at the same time.  To say I cared about him is an  understatement.<br />In the year of &quot;American Beauty&quot; and  &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; you would say it would be a losing  argument to say that Michael Mann deserved the oscar for best director, but  I truly believe he deserved it.  He creates a world all of its own.  A  world that I lived in without regrets for almost three hours.  This film  was masterfully helmed by Mann.  He guides the flow of the action and the  performances of the actors with such assuredness.  He took the story of one  nobody, one everyday man.  He took his struggle and showed it to us. And  most importantly, he made me care.<br />I have seen this film (and I choose to  use the word &quot;film&quot; as opposed to &quot;movie&quot; because it  truly is a work of art) five times now.  I will watch it again, either on  my own or when I am showing it to a friend.  This is a film that all should  see.
B000022TSY|3.0|&quot;Easy Rider&quot; is one of those movies that took me forever to see  and when I finally did I was dissapointed somewhat.  True, it launched the  careers of Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson.  It featured  some of the best rock music of the time in the soundtrack. The  cinematography is wonderful as well.  So what's the problem?  Well for one  thing the characters are not developed well at all.  By the film's end I  knew little more about them than I did when I started.  It was also fairly  boring too.  It did not move fast at all.  But it is worth a watch if you  want to see some great actors before they hit their prime.  And who can  argue with the famous credit sequence when Fonda and Hopper are riding  their bikes listening to &quot;Born To Be Wild&quot;?  It's good for a  viewing or two.  But don't expect anything magnificent.
6305807086|5.0|&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a revelation.  Of course this movie  isn't loved by all; but such gems that jumpstart a new wave of creativity  rarely reach universal popularity.  The first thing I thought of when I  heard about this movie was &quot;Anything this off the wall has to be  good.&quot;  The second thing I thought was &quot;Hey!  I didn't know we  could do that.&quot;  I mean, what a startling idea.  This movie really  pioneers a new genre: I call it &quot;reali-fantasy.&quot;           People  steer away from this film because they find it too bizarre.  But the sad  truth is that the oddities in this film are just warped fun house mirrors  to our own lives.  Afterall, the only happy, sucessful character in this  film is Maxine; a cold, calculating, me-first-screw-everybody-else type.   The honest people just striving for their dreams are miserable.  Craig  wants to be a successful puppetteer.  Lottie simply wants to be a mother.   It is apparent that they will not be reaching these goals at the outset of  the film.  <br />     Doesn't that just ring a little too true?<br />            How do they distract themselves?  Why, by becoming John Malkovich.  This  says another thing about our society; to distract ourselves from our  miserable lives we focus on celebrities.  We use them up, and when we are  done with them, leave them on the side of the road.<br />     This film is at  one moment utterly hilarious and all too depressing the next.  It truly is  a rollercoaster.  But with a story this enthralling, it is a ride you are  more than willing to take.<br />     John Malkovich delivers the greatest  performance of his career.  He doesn't only play John Malkovich, he also  plays the other characters that enter his mind so believably that you have  no problem believing that Craig Schwarftz is really controlling.<br />      John Cusack seems top be the only performer who didn't get any publicity  for this film.  That is really sad because his performance is so sublime  and strong.  After all, he is the sun of this film's universe.  If he  weren't as bright as he is the others would fall into despair apart.<br />      &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a new film for the new millenium.  It  is perfect frame by frame.  I reccomend this film for everyone.  At least  try it.  You might like it, you might not, but you'll have to admit that  you've never seen anything like this before.  If only every film could be  such an innovation.
630469654X|5.0|A young thief named Philippe (Matthew Broderick) escapes being hanged and  is embroiled in a supernatural tale of love and betrayal.  He is rescued  from the evil bishop's guards by Navarre (Rutger Hauer) who travels with  his trusty steed and his graceful hawk.  At night Navarre disappears,  leaving Phillipe who meets a beautiful woman (Michelle Pfieffer) and her  dangerous wolf.  As the bishop's guards close in on them, Navarre and his  hawk are wounded.  It is then that Philippe meets a drunken monk (Leo  McKern) and discovers the horrifying tale that joins the man and woman  together.   The scenery in this movie is magnificent and the lighting,  which was a terrible problem in video versions of this film, has greatly  improved making the night scenes enjoyable.  Matthew Broderick provides  wonderful comic relief.  Rutger Hauer is handsome, strong, and plays  Navarre perfectly.  Michelle Pfieffer is beautiful and graceful.  And Leo  McKern is.. well Leo McKern, fantastic no matter what he does.  A  wonderful, magical story of love and friendship triumphing over evil.
6302043158|5.0|I've seen a lot of reviews up here about how great Quadrophenia stands as  a film about Mod culture. It is probably the ONLY major film about the Mods  (there are many more on the Rockers). But to me, it is an awesome film  adaptation of the Who's electrifying concept album. This one's light years  ahead of the film version of &quot;Tommy,&quot; it's NOT a musical. It is a  perfect teen angst film that captures all the questioning about parents,  peers, and fitting in that so many young people face. and it doesn't come  on TV too much, so I'd suggest you either rent it or buy it.
0684852756|3.0|Having read 'The Buddha of Suburbia' prior to this, I was a bit  disappointed.  The plot was a bit scatchy and ridiculous.  If one's opinion  about the male psychology was based on this book, they would only come to  one conclusion about men - arrogant, cocky, shallow, and selfish.  I really  couldn't get into this book as much as I would have like to.<br />This novel  should have been a bit longer as well, in order to establish the plot and  the characters more clearly.<br />I hope Kureishi can do a better job next  time.
0517543052|5.0|I don't mean to insult the author but attempting to review such clearly  inspired work.  I only want to say this this book was pivotal in my  spiritual development from 20 years ago, and will always be on my bookshelf  as a reminder of what real growth is about.  Please, treat yourself to a  copy.  A million thanks to the authur.  :-)
B0000024JN|4.0|Yes, it's been THAT long. And although I myself prefer &quot;Paul's Boutique&quot;, this one is hands down the funniest rap album ever. The  interesting thing that you hear when listening to this album is that  Beasties started out as fakes. All they really were doing were rapping what  Rick Rubin wrote them - The Backstreet Boys for the beer-drinker set. Still  a mighty good record, even I personally wish they'da chilled out on the  fake 80s drum machines. How can you diss a song with a lyric like  &quot;Went into White Castle and I got thrown out&quot;?
6305892806|1.0|For Jane Austen lovers, most of whom are the audience of this type of film, Mansfield Park lets us down.  Not only does the movie do a  particularly bad job of staying true to the story but it goes into  territory that Jane Austen knew little to nothing about - slavery.  The  director obviously went looking for motivations for the action of the  movie.  The worst example of this being the acceptance and then rejection  of Henry Crawford by Fanny Price.  Instead of her dicision being vindicated  by the revelation of his character he seems almost justified in sleeping  with a married woman.   The acting is just what it should be for such a  film, but the choice of actress for the older Fanny Price was bad - she's  too old (as good as she was).  The cinematography and locations they chose  were spectacular, but that is the only saving grace.  Good sets however  were not enough to save this film.
B00004LN16|4.0|AC/DC's newest cd is up to par with much of their older stuff.  While I  don't think it is quite as good as Back in Black, I would still say it is  one of their best.
0790731894|1.0|Such a dumb movie. Sad, sad! Even Steven Seagal wanted out! You will too!
0393038912|4.0|This was one of the most educational books I have read in years.  Diamond  analyzes several key elements affecting the development of societies, from  the axis of the continent to the availability of plants that can be  domesticated, and makes it all very interesting.  One of the  best-researched books on the topic, Diamond still doesn't pretend to have  all the answers.<br />Unfortunately, Diamond excessively downplays the role of  culture and religeon influencing a society's development in the pursuit of  avoiding offending anyone.  The explanation of why the Fertile Crescent and  China lost technological leads over Europe, a topic that should have been a  key component of this book, is treated rather briefly in the final chapter  with somewhat cursory analysis. Nevertheless, this book is highly  recommended, particularly for laymen on the subject like myself.
6304458304|5.0|This is a great film. John Malkovitch's performance as the psycho assasin  is just beyond belief. Note as well the future Senator Fred Thompson as the  nervous Chief of Staff. Russo is also great in the role. A pretty  impressive cat and mouse game, exciting all the way through.
0385486804|5.0|Obviously this book strikes some sort of chord with a large and varied  audience. With the amount of reviews written about this book, people who  read it feel compelled to share their thoughts about it, be they positive  or negative. This is not a novel. This is not a biography. This is not a  simple story with a beginning, middle, and end. Do not expect to put this  book down and not be kept constantly thinking about it. This book cannot be  held merely within its front and back cover. If all you want to read is a  story that either makes you happy or sad, go to your local grocery store  and pick up a Harlequin Romance.  Given some of the reactions to this  book, it seems that many people are reading this after \\"Into Thin  Air\\". That book was autobiographical and cathartic. Krakaeur  reiterates his reasons for writing are part of a more personal struggle to  figure out what went wrong and how he might best tell the world about it  both from a subjective and objective standpoint. Krakauer was on Mount  Everest. He experienced that journey. He did not experience the journey of  Chris McCandless, and furthermore he does not act as though he did.  I  went to Emory while Chris McCandless was there. I did not know him or even  of him, although a friend or two may have had a class with him. Once I  heard of him and his exodus into the Alaskan wilderness, I was fascinated  with the mystery of his life and his death.  It upsets me that many  readers think Krakaeur is turning McCandless into a hero and holding him up  on a pedestal as someone who chose to be free and lived life as it should  be lived. While a reader may choose to interpret McCandless this way,  Krakaeur does not say this! Krakaeur's own fascination with the sheer  determination and sense of free will that McCandless embodies is quite  evident, so much so that he felt so strongly as to write a book about it.  On the one hand, Krakaeur does his best to investigate the facts of  McCandless' odyssey. Where did he go, when did he go there, how did he get  there, and what did he do while he was there. This is investigative  journalism: piecing together bits of random information from all sorts of  characters to put the puzzle together. Krakaeur does his best to give as  brutally honest and objective of a tale as he can.  What seems more  controversial than this method of storytelling is Krakaeur's quest for  understanding why McCandless chose to go forth \\"Into the Wild\\".  He asks the same questions as the readers (and not to forget the McCandless  family): What did he want to learn? What did he abhor about society and  why? What did he think true freedom was? Where did he get these ideas? What  was he trying to prove, if anything at all? Did he really think he would  survive and if he did, what then would he do?  By delving into the  writings and conversations of Chris McCandless, Krakauer attempts to answer  some of these questions. He does not claim to know anything for certain. He  offers some insights as drawn from both personal and historical anecdotes.  Why does anyone try and test their limits? Krakauer shows the reader that  perhaps no one knows exactly what they are trying to find out and the  journey that develops is a creation of this confusion. It is this entity,  the creation itself that is both the question and the answer.  The  reactions that the reader has from this book are almost as important as  what is actually written. Whatever it makes you question and feel, be glad  that someone made you think. I seriously doubt anyone can read this book  and not have an opinion. Every aspect of this book is a voyage of  discovery: for the reader, the writer, and the subject himself.
B000002OX7|5.0|I think The Who were at their peak at this point.  Although Tommy is a  great album, The Who had progressed a lot in 2 years with Who's Next.   Perhaps this is due to the inclusion of synthesizers on 2 of the most  popular tracks &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled  Again&quot; (Remember: this was 1971 and synthesizers weren't used as often  as they soon would be in rock music).    Originally, Who's Next was to be a  rock opera like Tommy and Quadrophenia were (and the title was to be  Lifehouse), but somehow Pete Townshend couldn't get everything to fall into  place (simmilar to the Beach Boys' Smile concept).  What came out, however,  is one record's worth of the Who's finest material.  Pete's lyrics portray  angst, despair, identity crises, cynicism, and rebellion against the  system.<br />&quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; is about the villain in the  Lifehouse project.  &quot;Goin' Mobile&quot; features some of Keith Moon's  fastiest and most frenzied drumming.  Session pianist Nicky Hopkins (who  also guested on Jeff Beck and Rolling Stones records) helps out the Who on  &quot;Gettin' In Tune&quot; and &quot;Song Is Over&quot;.  Roger Daltrey's  vocals are fierce, especially the scream at the end of &quot;Won't Get  Fooled Again&quot;.  Bass player John Entwistle composes 1 song here-  &quot;My Wife&quot; (on which he features brass).  Pete takes care of  virtually everything else (save the violin on &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot;)  from guitar to synthesizer to lead vocals on &quot;Goin' Mobile&quot; and  dueting with Roger on &quot;Song is Over&quot;.<br />Other songs included with  the rerelease are &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot;  (which wound up as a B-side on &quot;...Fooled Again&quot;), &quot;Pure and  Easy&quot; (whose theme can be heard at the end of &quot;Song...&quot;),  &quot;Naked Eye&quot;, &quot;Baby Don't Do It&quot; and an alternate take  of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; (featuring Al Kooper on organ).<br />Also, the  Lifehouse sessions box set is due out sometime this year!  I look forward  to its release.
0792836634|5.0|Note: does contain spoilers.<br />Child's Play is an excellent slasher movie that introduced Earth to the world of killer dolls.It also introduced us to  Chucky,the king of murderous play things.CP has a lot going for it.The  story for it's time was highly original and added a very refreshing twist  to the slasher genre.It isn't very original anymore due to countless  imatations that have followed (Puppet Master,Small Soldiers,etc).The  special F/X,though a bit corny compared to some of the advanced F/X these  days,are still great.The Chucky F/X are terrific,and to this day I still  wonder how he did all those crazy things (imploding house,returning as a  burnt zombie   doll,etc).The music is also wonderful.It's very  suspensful,and adds an additional element of fear.The acting is brilliant.  Brad Dourif is devilishly good as the voice of Chucky.The human actors are  very convincing as well.And although many people say  CP is very  funny,beware.Unlike the three sequels that followed,  the original CP has  plenty of thrills and chills.The beginning and ending sequences really  freaked me out when I first saw this. It still does oftentimes.The  photography is also slightly &quot;filthy&quot;,adding some more  suspense.The three following sequels did not have a &quot;filthy&quot;  picture.There are some pretty humorous moments too,but CP relies more on  scares than humor.Overall,  Child's Play is a brilliant slasher movie  that's a very welcome addition to a horror fan's library.It may be a bit  childish for some considering that the star of the show is a doll,and gore  hounds may be a bit disappointed as the level of gore isn't very high  (though some killing scenes are gross,like the voodoo doll sequence and  Chucky's demise).Also,Chucky has hardly any  one-liners,which in Child's  Play 2-4 are absolutely loveable.  Still,this is a slasher flick well worth  your time and cash. Buy it.<br />Rated R for some gory slasher violence and  language.
6305311463|5.0|i seen this movie when it first came out on the big screen.      the only  problem i have with this movie is that the actor      that played dr.  quincy should have spoken louder. that is      my only complaint.  otherwise, its an awesome movie. i hope      a sequel comes out.
0780622545|5.0|One of the most originally made films in recent years, Dark City is full of terrific imagery and a tight plot. Nightmarish figures, and likable  characters portrayed by Rufus Sewell and William Hurt. Give this movie a  shot. You may have a new favorite on your hands. The confrontation between  John Murdoch and Mr. Book is terrific.
6305232660|5.0|deep impact is your basic spinoff of the movie armageddon.  you have  some veteran actors in it like morgan freeman,  and maximillian schell,  and then you have up-and-comers  such as tea leoni. otherwise a good  movie
B000002IAZ|5.0|Other reviewers have provided a good overview of the group, Buffalo  Springfield.  I'll add my plaudits to the mix by saying this is a truly  outstanding collection. &quot;For What it's Worth&quot; is one of my all  time favorite songs in creation and it is an excellent musical statement of  the violence of the 1960s riots.  It is a political anthem that really does  make one &quot;stop, now, what's that sound, everybody look what's going  down.&quot;  This work deserves a place of honor in our soundsystems and in  our lives.  It is truly exceptional. I LOVE IT!
B00004U8JV|1.0|This plotless wonder has you cheering for the dinosaurs from minute one.  First, you hope they eat the entire cast, then, you hope they eat the  entire city of San Diego.  Nice special effects cannot counteract a muddled  script, poor acting, a pointless plot and a kid.<br />Save two hours of your  life, you'll never get them back if you watch this turkey.
B000002IZM|4.0|My inroduction to Vangelis' work came via the title film, Blade Runner,  and I subsequently embarked on a serach for his productions which left me  greatly satisfied.  The effect of the soundtrack to Blade Runner, though,  is quite a rare example of where the music and movie become so intertwined  so as to lessen either when the other is absent.  The New American  Orchestra's release of the soundtrack themes was serviciable, yet, all due  respect, a somewhat pallid rendering of what impressed me in the theatre as  a tour de force.  Regrettably, the present CD is also not a tour de force,  yet it is not altogether pallid either.  The authenticity of composition  and technique are here, but much of what I'd hoped would be present was  not.  However, some items were present which were unhoped for, perhaps  offering a glimpse into what might have been.  In particular,&quot;Blush  Response&quot; seems to so perfectly fit into Rachel's Voight-Kampf exam.   All who were mesmerized by the film will want a copy of this CD albeit with  the caveat that it has not the forcefulness of the original.  Yet it will  palliate the cravings for something tangible of a truly unique film.
B00000J7JO|3.0|The newest RHCP album, Californication has been met with rave reviews. Yet, I feel something is missing. I rushed out as soon as I heard it was  coming, and placed my order. When I got it, I played it constantly for a  while.<br />But there's not that 'rock' edge to them anymore. They've toned  down. No longer are they the cutting edge group who once made the CD 'Blood  Sugar Sex Magick'.... now they're playing 'Around the world'.<br />While I  enjoy the new album, compared to their older stuff which I would give fives  stars to any day of the week, I only give it three.
0767821629|4.0|The Thirteenth Floor deals with the ever-favorite tale of real vs. virtual. Great theme, well-developed plot, very detailed settings and  uncommonly-emotional orchestral soundtrack (for a sci-fi movie, that is). I  agree with other reviewers when they say this movie has poor direction and  acting, but it's certainly not the worst directed either. Just pay  attention to the storyline and the mystery and you'll forget about the  actor's performance. It's not that bad.<br />If you've seen a lot of sci-fi,  you'll find some cliche's: the green lights and lasers that the producers  put in every one of their films (Godzilla, Independence Day... remember the  merchandising?); the stereotypical computer hacker that eats, drinks and  makes love to computers; and the mystery involving a beautiful woman that  no one knows where she came from.<br />At the beggining of the movie you may  get lost if you don't pay enough attention. These first sequences seem to  give too much information needed to understand what's happening. It gives  the impression that the writers developed a story for the very few that  fully understand complicated theories involving virtual worlds and  highly-developed computer software. This is apparently true, given that it  became no box-office hit, opposed to THE MATRIX, which anyone can  understand because the story is mostly shown, not simply told.<br />Those  looking for virtual reality sci-fi with more story and less special FX will  find this movie very entertaining. I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps  because I'm a Star Trek TNG/DS9 fan who likes the sort of episodes where a  crewmember gets trapped in a virtual world but doesn't find out until the  end, yada yada yada...<br />And stop comparing this movie to THE MATRIX! That  one's the action- , superhero-based, special FX-type movie. This one's the  mind twister, the awareness-of-unreality-type movie.
630575067X|5.0|Now people will say its all special effects nothing more.  Those people  don't what they're talking about.  Watch the movie and you'll see that this  is as equal to the other three.  The story line in this is just as great as  the other three but it might take a little time getting used to the  characters.  I recommend that you watch the original three then watch this  one you'll get answers to questions you didn't know about, I guarentee it.   If you haven't seen the other three you might not like this but i doubt  that.  This movie has it all action, adventure, comedy, romance and even  some elemants of horror.  If you don't think it does have horror try to  think what it would be like if people who will soon become the empire  invade your planet... it would be horrifying.  Star Wars The Phantom Menace  has what the Return of the Jedi had: a battle on the ground, a battle in  space and a lightsaber battle.  Now that lightsaber fight was beautifully  planned out, if you didn't like that fight your crazy.  Now go on and rent  it, watch it again or buy it and you'll be pleased. May The Force Be With  You!!
0887306667|1.0|The whole book is very seductive. Look at this company, they understood  this principle, they were successful. Look at this other company they  didn't understand it, they weren't successful. Except that many of his  examples have had time to become contradictions of his original claims. It  all reminds me of the answer given by the famous communist when asked why  the socialist republics failed at the end of the cold war: &quot;Marxist  theory is correct, but the practice was never carried out in full  accordance with it, so it is hardly surprising that they all failed&quot;.  I'm sure Ries and Trout ought to seriously consider this as an escape  route. A better use of their time might be spent looking at the real  reasons why so many of the 'predictions' in this book have ultimately  proved to be so appallingly inaccurate.
B00003CXGG|2.0|but I know what a good movie is. This is not one. Although it is tauted as  &quot;From the producer of The MAtrix&quot; don't be fooled. The two have  one simularity: Wall-walking. The comic-relief is horrible, and I was bored  with the plot. &quot;Black Mask&quot; was much better.
B0000040IF|3.0|For those who don't know the plot of the movie, here it is.  The evil Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) tries to kidnap Princess Vespa of Druidia and Druidia's air is the ransom (planet Spaceball foolishly squandered their air), so her father, King Roland, hires Lone Starr and his half man half dog sidekick (John Candy) to rescue her.  Mel Brooks plays two characters in this movie, the wise little Yogurt and the evil leader of Planet Spaceball, president Skroob.    I personally enjoyed the movie thanks to the comical cleverness of Mel Brooks, but as far as overall movie quality goes (comparing this to movies like \\"The Green Mile\\") I think it's only fair to say that it only gets 3 stars (so-so) on that sort of scale, hence my rating.  I should also warn all those parents out there that the movie would probably get a PG-13 rating under the current system because of the profanity.  Even so, the movie is filled with jokes from start to finish to make one laugh out loud quite a few times.  Besides being an obvious spoof on Star Wars, it also lampoons (though in smaller quantities) Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, and Aliens.  I recommend this video for those who like comedy and spoofs, and in that area I give it four stars.
B00004TJTS|3.0|Awkward little boy in WWII era America and his relationship with his peppy  dog (Eddie from TV's Frasier).  Probably better for adults than small kids,   and have a hankie handy.   Subplot involving two dangerous bootleggers  almost derail the movie into Home Alone territory.
B000002BBY|3.0|My sister gave me this album because she had bought it on impulse and regretted it. I have been unable to pass it on to anyone else since. This  album is poor. I feel like the boy in the story of 'The Emperor's new  Clothes' because everyone else likes it but there you go. It is stuff like  this that turns me off guitar music. The title track is good, but generally  this album can't match Oasis' debut 'Definately Maybe,' or indeed their  contemporaries Blur, who, unlike Oasis, are still producing good albums.  This was maybe the biggest selling British album of the 1990s. But I don't  think people were buying the music, they were buying the attitude. Whenever  a guitarist wants to jam he breaks into 'Wonderwall,' thus ruining any  pleasure from the session. Come back Stairway to Heaven, all is forgiven.
0393316041|5.0|.<br />Feynman, the man who likes to &quot;do&quot; physics, takes us on a  eye opening journey into the world of why not.<br />He has an extraordinary  way of looking at the world that takes nothing for granted.  He experiments  with everything including some ordinary activities like asking someone to  handle a book and putting our sense of smell to work to find out which one.  What are our limits?  Should we continue not to try new things?<br />Each  chapter is a gem of a story.<br />Feyman's book is hilarious.  You will find  yourself talking about it for weeks.<br />Be sure to pass this book on to as  many people as possible.  It is a fast easy read and one of the most fun  books I've ever read.
0553274503|4.0|This book was so so well written, and majestically put together.  Like the  Catcher in the Rye, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Zen and the Art of  Motorcycle Maintenance, Flowers for Algenon is a modern classic that  challenges opinion and turns over the stones of controversy.<br />After the  first few pages this book pulls the emotional cords and tugs your  conscience in all directions.  I thought it lost something in the middle,  but it made up for it with a fantastic climax that could be seen a mile  off, but was still heart wrenching.
B000002J3W|5.0|This one is even better than Slave to the Gind and the debut, and they  both rocked too! The good thing about this one is that there's something  for anyone. Baz can sing a variety of songs good. Every album of theirs has  a soft/chick song, like Breakin Down on this one. There's &quot;Skid  Row&quot; style metal, like Firesign, Into Another, and Face against my  Soul. There's negative (which means good) songs like the title track, My  Enemy, and Iron Will. There's new sounding stuff, even a little weird, like  Frozen, Remains to be Seen, Beat yourself Blind. The heaviest would be  Bonehead, which sounds like thrash. I don't think they actually say the  title in the song. It'd be funny as hell if they did (&quot;Bonehead, my  face is turnin' red/Get out of my bed, you're gonna end up dead, ain't you  been fed&quot;). Okay, actually, that was stupid. Anyway, I'd get this one  over the greatest hits album, all the songs from this one are remixed, and  the songs they left off are better anyway.

B000002N2Z|5.0|The Deftones are the best metal band out there today and Adrenaline shows  that.  Stephen is one of the best guitarist I've heard and Chi throws some  cool as hell bass lines.  Abe is a good drummer but seems to emulate the  guitars a bit too much.  But Chino is the BEST vocalist ever.  From his  slow whispers to his blood curdling scream he can do just about anything  with his voice.  The song writing is very top notch in Adrenaline too.   Best tracks are One Weak, Root, 7 words, and Minus Blindfold.
B000001ABD|5.0|Imagine you are a successful multi-platinum selling artist. You sit down  and put this CD on. How do you feel? Jealous, that's how, because you know  that despite all your current fame and riches and talent, you'll never be  this good, and all your efforts will be forgotten in a generations time.   The best of Stevie Wonder, however, is timeless. This is pure quality. Can  I give it six stars?
B0000029AP|5.0|This is just the best rock and roll band there is: Aerosmith! This CD,  even though is old, is better than any other band that plays now. They just  rock! You won't regret buying this CD. Adam's Apple, Uncle Salty, and Sweet  Emotion will just blast your ears deaf at once! They just are pumping some  good stuff.
0425156842|1.0|Sophie's World was horrible!!! The whole book is not even a story, it was  just a way for the author, Jostein Gaardner, to get his thoughts out on  philosopy to people. I found myself skimming parts of it, and the  characters had no depth to them, because the whole book is an annoying  trick. Good luck if you buy this- it is in no means a fast read.
0671034065|1.0|If I want mystery I take Christie, murder and terror Cornwell, Nobels Hemingway, humor Wodehouse, romance White lies/ Mackenzies mountain. Which one doesn't fit in? This book! It was such a mixup of everything. Bad  language, murder, violence, pedofiles, child abuse. Where was the rapist?   The story line was poor, h/h just jumped to the same bed, nothing sizzling.  And how much did it cost. Wait for a paperback or borrow it  from somewhere.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones have changed but its not a bad change at all.  They kept that  Deftones felling and evolved into a sound that leaves your mind in a  trance.  I'll just do a 1-10 scale showing my thoughts on every  song.<br />Feiticeira- 8.3/10  An excelent opening to the early pick for best  album of 2000.  A story of a kidnaping with a slow but moderatly heavy  guitar.  <br />Digital Bath- 10/10  I swear this will be their second single  of this album.  A ballad with Frank mixing in seemlessly and Chino using  his voice to its full potential.  Don't really know the meaning of this  song.<br />Elite- 9.2/10  The lyrics are cryptic but when you really think  about them its about someone shy realising his/hers full potential but  abusing it after all.  Definatly their heaviest song to date and its nice  to hear Chino scream but it seems to similar throughout the song to be a  full 10.  Best lyrics in the whole album including &quot;when your ripe  you'll bleed out of control&quot; and &quot;Your into deppression cause it  matches your eyes&quot;<br />RX Queen- 8.1/10  A slower atmoshpheric song like  Digital Bath but heavier.  To me the meaning is about an old man losing  faith in this world and doing suicide to escape.  <br />Street Carp- 7.9/10   Heavier but not as nearly as heavy as Elite.  Chino making you believe he  forgot his phone number is a cool touch to a cool song.<br />Teenager- 8.9/10   A very slow acustic/technoish song about someones first love.  The lyrics  aren't as cryptic as other songs and Chino's voice is simply  angelic.<br />Knife Prty- 10/10  My favorite song on this album.  Heavy but  not something you could mosh to like Elite.  The depictions of violence and  blood are covered up in a sense cool line is &quot;in here we are all  anemic, In here anemic and sweet&quot;  The female singers scream in the  background is spine chilling.<br />Korea- 9.1/10  Very much like the old  Deftones as it was the first song written for this album.  Heavy with somevery original guitar cuts and Chino goes back to that oh so familiar  scream.  Lyrics are cryptic as hell.<br />Passanger- 9.3/10  Blend together  the 2 best vocalists of all time (Moreno and Keenan)  and you get a  masterpiece.  A story of a kidnaping again but this time a kidnaping that  is accepted by the victim.<br />Change (in the house of flies)- 9.0/10  Very  My Own Summer-ish with metaphorical lyrics (I think).  The video is cool  and depicts the atmosphere good by the way.  Very well written on all  sides.<br />Pink Magget- 9.0/10  Starts off slow with only singing and some  spaced guitar work but evolves into one of the best songs on the album.   Its the story of being the coolest kid in school and later in life getting  knocked down.  The heartbeat at the end is the perfect end for this album.
068484267X|5.0|When this book first came out, i was quite reluctant to read it.  As I am  a native of Limerick City which is where McCourt is from.<br />However, once I  began to read the book.  I couldn't put it down.  Every scene in the book  was so well described, I could feel myself going back in time.  I enjoyed  the way each of the characters were portrayed.  However, cruel he was to  his Mother.<br />What appealed to me most about this book was the way in which  he described his school days in such an animated and fun way.  Its hard to  believe in parts that he is no longer a young man, long gone from his  native city.  I found myself laughing loudly as he described certain events  that happened at school.<br />All in all, this book is a great success for its  wit &amp; also for McCourts amazing ability to vividly remember his  childhood, even though it was not a happy one.
B000000OTU|5.0|This CD is plain great! The best rock band you could find, and the best  rock you can buy! This will hook you up with Aerosmith! After listening to  this CD your body will crave Aerosmith! I guarantee it!
6305079900|5.0|I bought this dvd because its my favourite film of all time, the picture  is not perfect and the sound is in mono,but never mind MGM are releasing a  Special Edition early 2001 with Anamorphic picture, 5.1 Digital sound and  other extras,should be worth the wait.
0375703764|5.0|The moment I got this book in the mail, I thought it would  be one of  those books you either love or hate. I have to say that I definitely  thought I would hate it. Surprise!!! Its one of the greatest books I have  ever read. The story line is rather unbelievable, but surprisingly, the  author handles it in a way that you are completely caught up in whats  going on and you find yourself believing the plot. Its the closest Ive  ever felt to watching a movie in my head. The book combines fact and  fiction in a way that confuses you and makes it difficult to identify which  is which.  Oh! and the appendixes are absolutely amazing!!! But this book  now!!!
B00000IAU3|5.0|This cd I can listen to over and over and never get sick of! It's great!  Every song is good! I have to say though that Here With Me and Honestly Ok,  are my 2 favorite songs on the album. Honestly Ok is the saddest song I  think i've ever heard, but get this cd if your into sarah mclachlan, cuz  she sounds a little like her but her sound is a little more funky.
6305095574|5.0|This is a truely frightening film about Ash (Bruce Campbell) and four  friends who decide to escape their busy lives for a weekend away in a cabin  deep in the woods. What they don't expect is the hellish nightmare they are  about to embark on. What they don't know is that there is something lurking  in the woods around them. Something evil. They find a tape recorder that  belonged to a man that occupied the cabin before. He reads passages from  &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; which bring the demons to life. This is  one of those fims that stays with you for awhile after you watch it. The  shocking gore and gruesome terror leaves your heart pumping after the film  is over. You have to stop yourself from covering your eyes several times. A  cult favorite that is worth checking out. Great suspense and very gruesome.  This is one of the only films that I can't watch alone. That's how scary it  is. Check it out and you won't be disappointed! -Scott
6303365752|5.0|Black Diamond Skiing shows 2 skiers performing a variety of turns in sync  with the movie. The idea is to watch the movie repeatedly which is supposed  to train your muscles to repeat the moves. I have found this to be true,  but you must watch this film A LOT. Like &quot;Viewer from Colorado&quot;,  I came to this site to purchase this movie. &quot;Horsepla&quot; may be  correct, but since I have been skiing for 20 years, I haven't found the  basics to have changed that much due to equipment.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer's self titled album is a gem.  It's one of those rare albums that  people can easily identify with.  Weezer brings out the geek in all of us.   <br />Every song is great off this album.  My personal favorites are &quot;No  One Else,&quot; &quot;The World Has Turned And Left Me Here,&quot;  &quot;Say It Ain't So,&quot; and &quot;Only In Dreams.&quot;  The lyrics  are catchy, introverted, fun, and always sincere.  <br />I've never met  another human being who did not like this album.  Weezer's blue album is a  no risk purchase.  If you buy it, you'll instantly love it.  I bought it  years ago, and I still listen to it on a regular basis.  If you choose not  to buy it, you're missing out on one of the best albums of the '90s.
078062999X|5.0|This is the only film version of Hamlet I have seen fully, but I played  Horatio in a stage production several years ago, and therefore have a  well-rounded knowledge of the play.  I would give this film a 8 out of 10  for acting, but 9.5 out of 10 for visual design, costuming, etc.   <br />Branagh is a very good Hamlet, Derek Jacobi is probably the best as  Claudius, and most of the other cast is passable.  The celebrity cameos  were fun (Robin Williams is perfect) and harmless (except for Jack Lemmon!)   <br />The entire setting has been overhauled to the mid-19th century, which  works perfectly fine, except for a few script incongruities (e.g.,  references to obsolete weapons and Hamlet being attacked by pirates on his  way to England).  Those who would condemn this change in period may forget  that Shakespeare thought nothing of including cannon and other fixtures of  his time when writing within ancient and medieval settings. A fresh   interpretation of many scenes has been attempted, usually involving  mirrors, hidden passages, and people walking through several rooms while  they speak--a nice metaphorical addition to the ever-present themes of  madness vs. sanity and secrecy vs. innocent ignorance.  The climactic  &quot;mortality scene,&quot; which I like to call it, is excellent--not  truly over the top.  The actor playing Horatio was solid, and really shined  when on the verge of suicide (&quot;I am more an antique Roman than a  Dane&quot;).  However, the scene that actually made the biggest impression  on me was Reynaldo's (Gerard Depardieu) brief interview with Polonius.  I  won't spoil it other than to say it completely altered my perception of  Polonius and added a whole layer of seediness to Laertes' travels in France  (and by the way, it appears that he brings Paris Communards or some such  folk along with him when returning to Denmark!)
157270036X|3.0|This is a marvelous story, but the reader Roses Prichard, ruins it for the listener.  Often, one cannot tell which character is speaking due to  Prichard's inability to vary her voice. I would not recommend this  audiobook to anyone.
B000001OAA|4.0|I like most of Garbage's music. It gets better as it goes on and not only  that Shirley's real hott. I give This 4 stars because it's not the best  I've heard, but it needs credit for good ballads and real singing. I  personally don't think there's any flaws to their albums so it needed at  least 4 stars. There was better stuff on Version 2.0 but their just so good  that i have to do what i do
B000002OR4|5.0|I really  like this movie and the music is  so beautiful that  its so much  to the ears then it is to the heart i think  John Williams  did a GREAT job  with this score its  so cool. as a musician  my self its  so much more then   music  its telling a story of a life and a world that was living some time  ago .

I would like to pay my sincerest tribute to Morrie.  He does  remind me what we have forgotten.  &quot;TO LOVE OR TO PERISH!&quot;
6305810109|5.0|First of all, it's an absolute crime that Richard Farnsworth lost to Kevin Spacey for best actor. <br />We shouldn't be all that shocked that David Lynch  made this movie. After all, remember, he did make The Elephant Man, and  half of Blue Velvet, including the ending, is pure Norman Rockwell. What's  shocking is that The Straight Story didn't get more attention, what with  everyone bewailing Hollywood's hand in our country's \\"moral decline.\\" On  that subject, my favorite line in the film comes after Alvin careens down  the hill. A woman asks if he's afraid to be out on the road alone because  \\"there are weird people everywhere these days.\\" Weird people, indeed. The  woman has listened to too many talk shows and Republicans.  The country is  falling apart, right? So why is it that everywhere Alvin goes he meets kind  people, generous people, warm people? Everyone in America should see this  movie and make themselves believe in it. <br />I wanted to respond to one  reviewer from Lumberton, NC who said that Blue Velvet (\\"absolute garbage\\"  as he called it) was about his hometown. All billboards and commercials in  BV identify the town as Lumberton, USA, and it's clearly meant to be a kind  of mythic place somewhere in Lynch's native Northwest. Blue Velvet took  Rockwell's idealized, propagandized, America to task, but The Straight  Story gives us real people in a real place. It's a beautiful movie. Watch  it as soon as possible.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I like the beat to &quot;Say I&quot; and lots of other stuff. They might  copy a sublime title altough they have great stuff that will make you  listen. some rock bands scream too much instead of singing (such as Motley  Crue) and they actually kind of christian but they don't really always  mention that kind of stuff. They are one of my faves
B00003CX6P|2.0|I was really looking forward to this film, expecting a dark, suspenseful  thriller. Boy, was I disappointed! Instead, I sat through a SLOW-paced,  over-long, not-too-interesting character portrait with few thrills and no  suspense. Matt Damon's Ripley was a bit too subtle for my taste ... I never  really knew what was going through his conniving mind. I soon realized that  he wasn't the &quot;talented&quot; genius and plotter the hype led me to  believe. Instead, Ripley is an incredibly LUCKY opportunist. Fate was  smiling on his side. He doesn't cleverly talk his way out of danger as much  as &quot;lucks&quot; his way out of it. The most interesting parts of the  story are the scenes in which he almost gets found out because of his own  stupidity (e.g., keeping Dickie's rings, very poor concealment of his  crimes, spending his sudden unexplained wealth, letting witnesses see him,  etc.). And just when the suspense starts building and I expected his scheme  to come crashing down on him, the authorities simply let him go without  much suspicion. Only Marge has him figured out (why, it's never really  explained). Everyone else, including Dickie's father, refuse to believe  Ripley may be a murderer despite all the evidence. This sort of  manipulative story telling strained my credibility to the limit long before  the predictable ending on the cruise ship. Bottom line: a disappointing  yawner.
6303160344|5.0|This movie is maybe how would be an godly-inspired theological movie  rewritting Bible's hope message for modern times.<br />The story starts  showing a wealthy french family life where Juliette Binoche portrays a  happy mother. Then the family has a major car crash where she is the only  survivor. Here life is destroyed and she goes to hell while she slowly  undergoes physiotherapy. From there, she fights slowly against herself and  goes up the ladders of true liberty. The outcome is her acceptance of love  and her true meaning in life. <br />The movie is a difficult psychological  treck against egoism and self-destruction and it finishes on a true vision  of hope and humanity. Everyone should see it when depressed.
6303168507|5.0|Schindler's List is such an emotionally shattering and gripping movie that  no true words can even describe it. There are scenes in this movie that  will live in your memory forever. The performances from Liam Neeson, Ben  Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes are flawless. The soundtrack is also great,  with sad, classical music from the great John Williams and violinist Itzhak  Perlman. The last few scenes of this movie are so moving, inspirational,  and touching that you find yourself literally crying when Oskar Schindler  says to Itzhak Stern that he could have got more Jews out of the  concentration camps. When Schindler suddenly breaks down and cries, he is  so magnificent. I think that crying emotionally on-screen in movies is a  greater and better acting style than others. Liam Neeson can act in the  last scene he's in, and in general. He should have won the Oscar for  playing Oskar Schindler in this movie. Director Steven Spielberg really  created a true masterpiece with this movie. This movie should be shown in  every history class there is in high school. It is a triumph!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I like this album especially &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;Run On&quot;  I have the new one too, but I have to say he's my favorite dance/rock  artist out today &quot;Play&quot; is a good experience.
B000007OY0|5.0|This is truely a rare film, where the triumph of the human spirit shines  through.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely superb in this  movie and all of the other supporting actors make this film worth watching  over and over again.  It shows the worst of the human spirit and how it  ruins a person completely to showing the best of the human spirit and how  it can redeem and cleanse a mans soul even in the worst possible  conditions.  The narration by Freeman during the movie adds even more to  the overall story.  This was brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's short  story, and I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to see a brilliant  piece of film making.
B00002N9ER|4.0|I have a set of these mounting brackets bolted to my garage workbench and  can always count on finding my Maglite flashlight just where I left it -  safe and secure.  The plastic seems a bit fragile, but in the two years  that I have used them, I have never had a failure.  The flashlight securely  snaps into place and is not in danger of falling out.<br />If I were to do it  again, I'd buy a set of these in a minute.  It functions well and does the  job for which it was intended.
6305892806|4.0|Having failed to read Jane Austen's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, I can't really compare the movie to it.  Nevertheless, I shouldn't have to, and the  movie should stand on its own feet.  The story of how young Fanny Price  escapes a crude life with her family in Portsmouth to become a servant in  the magnificent &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; manages to build up to soemthing  several times through the film, only give up.  Already intelligent and  imaginative when she first leaves home, Fanny grows into more intelligent  and beautiful young woman, more than Sir Thomas' daughters.  Yet the film  gives Fanny's wit little bite, and tool little of that is alotted to her  unwanted suitor.  Fanny much prefers sir Thomas' pious son, but that  romance seems inexplicably obstructed by his engagement to the slyly amoral  Mary Crawford.  Are we really to believe that Edmund, comntemplating the  life of a cleric, would propose to the seductive Crawford?  And why would  she accept, being openly contemptuous of a life that spurns materialism.   Edmund seems to much a cypher without Mary Crawford: he keeps Fanny  supplied with paper, quills and attention as Fanny grows into a young  woman, but he becomes all too serious as a young man, and it's hard to  visualize him growing up on Fanny's spicy prose.  Fanny's position seems  comfortably settled between servant and family, but she remains a servant,  a member of the lesser class, and the consequences of her refusal to marry  the conceited Mr. Crawford destroy the illusion...only for it to return  when Fanny is called back to Mansfield Park from exile.  Sir Thomas' other  son, the sole beneficiary - under primogeniture - of the elder Bertram's  fortune, is slowly going insane at the prospect of an inheritance that  includes a slave colony in Antigua.  Thomas' fevered sketches of Antigua  seem almost modeled after those taken of the European concentration camps  of the last world war.  Yet Thomas is barely a presence in the film and hisredemption, as well as both the elder Bertram's divestment from the slave  trade and the racist attitudes upon which he rationalizes it are all  cavalierly discarded by the end of the film, never tied to gether or  convincingly addressed.  <br />Still, the actring is crisp and conveys what  viewers may not be able to get from the words themselves, and Mansfield  Park itself is the perfect setting.  Containing not rooms as much as  enclosed spaces as voluminous as caverns, it appears to open and  claustrophobic when the scene requires it.

0780626478|5.0|This is an excellent, charming movie that showcases the acting of Brendan  Fraser and Alicia Silverstone, as well as two other great actors, Sissy  Spacek and Christopher Walken (in one of his few &quot;good guy&quot;  roles).  The plot of the movie is clever and funny, and once you see it,  you are drawn in to see what happens next.<br />Fraser is so likeable in this  movie, that you instantly are on his side and the beautiful Alicia  Silverstone does another fine job of acting as the girl any guy could fall  for.  Spacek and Walken play Fraser's &quot;time warped&quot; parents, yet  their love and concern for their son (Fraser) is charming.  The movie has a  great plot and will keep the viewers interest from beginning to end.  Highly recommended!

0800132009|5.0|Today Sir Alec Guiness costar of The Bridge on the River Kwai died, his  passing is a great loss to the world for he was a truly a magnificent  actor. This was one of his best roles. The film deals with many of the  aspects of war, one I  found particularly thought provoking was Colonel  Nicholson (Alec Guiness) defense of his work on the bridge. The bridge was  a project for the enemy so why do a good job? Colonel Nicholson thought  that he should do so because he bore a professional responsibility to work  to the best of his ability. We think it perfectly proper for a doctor to do  his best at all times including the medical treatment of  an enemy soldier,  why hold engineers to a different standard? Few films challenge the viewer  as much as this one did. Here is another great work from that much maligned  decade, the 1950's. If this decade was so vapid why did it produce so many  great novels, films and theatrical works? Why do we continue to imitate its  creations?
0671034065|3.0|I really did like this book! It was interesting and really fasted paced!  However I think that the friendship between the 4 women in the book could  have been a preserved a little better! What happend to Luna(one of the  friends)seemed a bit unessasary and over the top! Other then that I though  the romance was excellent as usual...and I think that fact that she tried  to give more detail on some of the minor players was well thought out.
0452282195|3.0|The Bluest Eye is a very well written portrayal of a child who is without  a semblance of parental love, goodness or guidance and the vagaries of the  community within which she lives.  This black child focuses on the  attainment of blue eyes, evidently society's standard of perfection to her,  as the &quot;passport&quot; to all she so desperately desires in her arid  life.  The reader is introduced to many well-conceived characters while  getting to know Pecola.  This book left me thinking about the many  kindnesses we all do and do not demonstrate to each other in this  world...and how much the smallest kindness is treasured by the recipient.   Toni Morrison makes her readers think and feel, and that is always the sign  of a first-rate author.
0440211727|4.0|Jake Brigance is a small-town lawyer with a small-town law practice, taking nickel &amp; dime cases to make ends meet. A young attorney in  Clanton, Mississippi, Jake's future as a big-time criminal defense lawyer  is incredibly turned down a frightening path in which he encounters the  desperate and grim face of racism at its worst. Because of his skill in  defending Lester Hailey, Jake is hired to defend Carl Lee Hailey in hopes  of obtaining Carl Lee's freedom, despite Carl Lee's admittedly  pre-meditated murder of two white men, Billy Ray Cobb and Ernest  &quot;Pete&quot; Willard.<br />The rape of ten year old Tanya, Carl Lee's  daughter, by Billy Ray and Pete, has to be one of the most torturous events  in fiction that Grisham has written; to even imagine that two men could  perpetrate such an act on so young a child is absolutely horrific and  incredible. Throughout, Grisham plays strongly on the premise that people  who have children know exactly what they would do, were they in Carl Lee's  shoes - to avenge the horror of such despicable actions in the only way  such men would understand - violent death.<br />When I first read this novel,  I was angered and irritated by the depth of hatred that exists within  racism. I was angered that had Carl Lee been a white man bent on avenging  his daughter's suffering, he would never have had to face trial. Grisham in  fact, points this out several times throughout the novel, and this becomes  a rallying point for Carl Lee's supporters. Whereas vigilante justice is  not acceptable by any stretch of the imagination, Grisham appeals to the  emotions of parents - black or white - and succeeds in winning us over. In  fact, this is exactly how the jury decides Carl Lee's fate, rejecting the  pressure of the Klan, as well as the black community who thronged the  courthouse chanting, &quot;Free Carl Lee!&quot;.<br />A Time to Kill is a  disturbing novel, aside from the raping and killing that opens the tale. It  is not possible to look at our justice system the same way, especially from  the viewpoint of the black community in the South - even today. It seems  that although we have come far since the 1960's and Dr. King, Grisham would  have us believe that not much has changed for the better.<br />Peace Out.

B000008DA5|4.0|Although with every BB album there are severe problems (Mike Love), these  two albums are great.  Even though I fully expected to hate them they are  both great in their own way.  Smiley smile is great because it has a lot of  stuff from the SMILE album (although disappointing versions of these songs  - listen to a bootleg of SMILE and you will know what I mean) But Wild  Honey is amazing!!!  I thought it would be monotanous but instead it is  funky, beautiful and catchy (although it took me a couple of listens before  I fully appreciated it)  I particularly felt the first 6 songs were great.   BUy Pet sounds,SMILE bootleg, and this and you will be in Brian Wilson  heaven - no need for that earlier crud (like California Girls - YUKKKKK!!!)
0590353403|5.0|JK Rowling creates a fascinating world with wonderful characters.

The list ladies are smart and you don't find  yourself saying &quot;why did you do that!&quot;  As for Jaine's neighbor  Sam, well you have to read the book. This is the  best Linda Howard book  yet.
B000003NA4|5.0|A must have for the Diana Krall fan, both present fans and fans waiting to  happen.   She makes all of these old standards sound fresh and new.   The  beat and music behind the sounds make them recognizable but different at  the same time.  Makes me think that the old standards will come back and  make rock and roll seem as tired and old as it really is.
B00001NFCY|4.0|Creed has, for the second time, shown critics that grunge is not dead.  Along with Godsmack, both bands have created a sound reminiscent of Pearl  Jam and Alice in Chains.  Yet while these bands have gone astray, Creed has  stepped in to keep this great genre alive.  Although Human Clay isn't as  good as their debut My Own Prison, Creed's sophmore effort is anything but  a slump.  What if is a great song with some great guitar playing.  Higher  is also strong.  The first song, Are you ready is one of the best intro's  to an album that I've heard.  This album is truly a diamond in the rough,  showing metal still rules over those no talent groups like the backstreet  boys.

0385484518|5.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" by Mitch Albom is a gift from two people.  The  first person is Morrie Schwartz,  who used the process of his death to  instill in people an urgency about living fully and truthfully, not just  mechanically according to the dictates of one's culture.  The second person  is Mitch Albom, who recreates his experience of Morrie so vividly that I  feel as if I gained a friend in Morrie and suffered a deep loss in his  death.   Albom lets us feel his heart in the story so honestly that  something in me relaxed around the discomfort with the topic of death.  And  while I really like the wisdom that Morrie imparted to Mitch, what stays  with me is the passion for life that Morrie had - it is palpable and  contagious.  If you catch it, it could heal something in you.<br />    To  readers interested in discovering a fuller life,  I highly recommend  \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This book is  for anyone who wants to live each day with self-expression, satisfaction   and love.  Many books have pointed the way for me, but this one went right  to the heart of the matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you stuck in  the places you'd like to be free of, but getting into the moment will set  you free.  Just in reading and re-reading the book, I've found myself  falling into the space of living in the moment and my life has become  miraculously easier.  This book is truly a gem. Don't miss it.

B00003CX95|1.0|Despite the apparent effort toward period realism put into this epic, it still gets mangled. In any case, I like my &#34;realistic&#34; movies to be a little more balanced when protagonists and antagonists are compared. In short, anyone who opposes or betrays Wallace is shown to be close to a cartoon villain. Since most of these are English, Gibson panders effectively to latent American Anglophobia - not a surprise that the movie was so popular in the US. Such an approach is however silly and over-simplified. At least Robert the Bruce is shown to be dealing with the mental pangs of shifting loyalties, and patriotism vs pragamatism. Not surprisingly, one of the few actors in this film that can act, Angus MacFadyen, portrays the Bruce.<br />I'd certainly view the film as much more effective if the &#34;villains&#34; were a bit less one-dimensional. Patrick McGoohan is particularly disappointing, his over-the-top portrayal of Edward I being close to a lampoon. And I'm sorry, but I also choke a bit on some of the nearly laughable historical inaccuracies. I know Gibson didn't intend to create educational material here, but knowing how many people take their understanding of history from &#34;historical&#34; movies implies at least some measure of responsibility on the part of the film maker. Of course, what can one expect with the overrated, undertalented Gibson at the helm?

B000002UJQ|5.0|I discovered this cd through &quot;TOP 100 of all time&quot; Music Polls.  Now I know why it makes the lists. Prior to owning this masterpiece I only  knew Radiohead for &quot;Creep&quot; and unfairly assumed they were another  &quot;fly by night&quot; grunge band on the 90's bandwagon. Shame on me. I  suggest listening to O.K. Computer in it's entirety with headphones for the  first 2 or 3 listens. You do have to ingest it over time and introduce it  to your musical pallette slowly. I will also admit it will not be appealing  to everyone although I am sure many will miss the point by not giving it a  chance to sink in. I consider it the &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; of music  titles. The unorthodox melodies are strange and wonderful. The vocals are  passionate and naturally performed. The guitar parts are well thought out  without sounding preconceived. The production is honest but never pushed  even sounding cheesy in spots (like the vocoder style background voices in  &quot;Exit Music&quot;). However it always seems appropriate for the mood  or style of the song. There are few cd's I own that can be listed to as an  &quot;entire works&quot; (not just a collection of songs). I catalog O.K.  Computer with BEACHBOYS-PETSOUNDS; BEATLES- ABBEY ROAD &amp; SGT PEPPER;  PINK FLOYD - DARK SIDE OF THE MOON; and JELLYFISH - SPILT MILK along with   a few others as one of the greatest masterpieces in Rock Music. A true  desert island for this critical music lover!!

They just try too hard or not enough here.  Sorry guys, you're a  potentially great band, but great bands are consistent.  This record is  not.  Don't buy it, buy the singles.
B00000J6AG|4.0|this is an excellent album for anyone.  its definitely a two part album,  with the first half filled with the unique field holler/blues sampling, the  second with slower and more emotional tracks.  watch for porcelein,  southside (good guitar solos), bodyrock, if things were perfect, and  inside.
6305892946|2.0|A suggestion to the producers of this trilogy: I suggest this was the last  movie made. Otherwise, the series and characters will run the risk of  becoming ridiculous (as happened with &quot;Friday 13th). The plot here is  obviously worst than the two first movies.

With him being an only child I often say to  him &quot;The best things in life aren't things&quot;.

B000020617|4.0|Grohl is making songs more catchy and commercial, but that doesn't mean  the album is bad. It's very good, with great rock tunes, nothing much  agresive, but well crafted and played with the custumary Foo Fighters  energy. I prefer &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;, but this one is in  accord with Foo Fighters standards.
B00004TH83|4.0|I have to admit that I grew up listening to Celine's French music, though I'm not a big fan of female singers. When I first heard Lara's French song  &quot;Tout&quot; (from the album &quot;Pure&quot;) back in 1998, I realized  that there were better singers out there than Celine.<br />Compared to  Celine's, Lara's voice is natural, never does it sound fake. This first  English album is not her best one yet. (I believe the French album  &quot;Pure&quot; is much better !) The ballads on this &quot;Lara  Fabian&quot; album are quite romantic, pleasant to hear and passionate.  Lara puts as much voice, love and talent as she can in all the languages  she sings. I look forward to an Italian album ! Lara is finally getting out  of the French market, coming out strongly on the American market, which is  wonderful : she is one of the most talented female singers of our time.
B000000SDB|5.0|I paid full price for this set when I was a broke graduate student.  It  was an investment definitely worth making!<br />Harnoncourt's conducting can  be quite tiring; accents way overdone, tempi rushed here, phrases dragged  there.  But this recording, well, Harnoncourt emerges as one of The Great  Beethoven interpreters.<br />Let's start off with the approach.  It's a  compromise between period instruments and modern instruments.  For the most  part, it's all modern instruments that play in an &quot;authentik&quot;  style.  My predisposed response would usually be:  &quot;Well, that's  doomed for failure!&quot;  Turns out, that response would not have  considered the brilliance of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, an amazing  ensemble that is as chimeric as you desire.  They execute Harnoncourt's  conception with blazing intensity, accuracy, and  enthusiasm.<br />Harnoncourt's conception:  a little more quick than most,  maybe slower than some conductors with period bands, but it's all  wonderful.  Take symphonies 1 and 2.  Masterpieces that aren't performed  enough.  They smile in his hands.  They startle.  They provoke.  That's  what they should be!  Have you noticed the very first two chords of No. 1?  Geez, what was LvB thinking of?  They symphony sounds like it should end  before it's started--and Harnoncourt gives you that impression.<br />And so it  goes.  Other reviewers seemed to have found No. 6 eccentric.  I find it to  be wonderful, and totally different than my expectations (which were:  dismal failure.  He'll go too fast, or be pushy).  It bubbles and gurgles!  No. 9 is the only one that didn't wow me, but it's hardly a bad peformance.  Furtwangler really has a stranglehold on the ninth for me.<br />Wonderful  music, great engineering, good documentation.
0618002219|5.0|An excellent book.  I recomend it to anyone and everyone.  The Hobbit is  the prelude to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Ring.  It is a must if you plan  to read all of the other books by Tolkien.
B000001GPX|4.0|The Vienna Philharominic, Kleiber, and Beethoven, what a match!<br />The  Fifth is an excellent recording and preformance.  In fact, the Finale is  probably one of the best I've ever heard.  BUT, Kleiber is lacking  something in this performance, which amazes me, given his sensitivity.  That is in the most amazing transition from III to IV.  Where is the  mystery?  Where is the tension?  Why am I not on the edge of my seat?  It's  not there.<br />To his credit, most conductors miss on this important  transition.  I like Harnoncourt (Teldec) a lot in this piece, and Cluytens  (EMI), too, but neither of them really make it in the transition  department.  I'm still eager to get my hands on Reiner with the CSO (RCA).  Also, I'm eager to try out Vonk (who will probably disappoint if one wants  only fire, but I haven't heard his performance yet on Archmedia), Steinberg  (EMI?), Zander (Telarc), Bernstein (Sony), and Szell (Sony).  BTW, Dorati  (London/Decca) can be totally disregarded IMHO (if it's even available  anymore), Celibidache (EMI) is a beautiful re-thinking of the piece, but  again, maybe not for everyone, and Zinman (Arte Nova) is merely  excellent.<br />Acquire the disk for the 5th.  But the 7th is merely filler.  II doesn't sing very well, and even the fury of IV is meaningless to me.  The introduction to I should be miraculous, and here it isn't.  Steinberg,  again going against the tide of critical acclaim, with Pittsburgh on EMI is  just wonderful, despite the less-than-perfect ensemble and recording.  Harnoncourt's 7th is again outstanding, and I haven't heard Zinman (Arte  Nova), although that, too, is suppposed to be superb in the Toscanini  model.  And don't forget Casals (Sony)!!
B000001IQH|5.0|I didnt know you were allowed to make albums this good. But Tim Armstrong  and company seemed to of create an album that goes far beyond any other  punk album. For the first time I think that Rancid can live up to the  standards of Operation Ivy. The Best songs are &quot;Maxwell Murder&quot;,  &quot;11th Hour&quot;, &quot;Roots Radical&quot;, &quot;Time Bomb&quot;,  and --- wait what am I saying, all the songs on &quot;.. And out come the  Wolves&quot;  are totally awesome, Im about to go buy their new self titled  album, I can only pray that its as good as this one.

0440234743|3.0|This was not my favorite Grisham book but it still held my interest right  to the end.  I was a little concerned when he introduced a christian  missionary in, for me, an unexpected twist but he handled it nicely and  made it work.    I liked this book and any Grisham fan will.
0800132335|5.0|This film is a dedication to the brave men who served on German U-Boats.   Almost half of whom never returned.  This is a gripping tale of harsh  reality as well as an anti-war film.  <br />This movie chronicles life on  board a German U-Boat toward the end of the war.  With the Allies  controlling the skies, and allied submarine hunter-killer vessels searching  for German submarines, U-Boats continued to be used to satisfy one mission  requirement or another.  Keep in mind that the German surface fleet was  very ineffective.  The U-Boats were the only shinning stars to Germany's  naval campaigns. <br />The U-boats's stoic skipper receives orders to sail  through the heavily guarded straits of Gibraltar to cause havoc to allied  shipping in the Meditterranean Sea.  Suffice it to say, the trip through  Gibraltar is extremely dangerous.  However, the courageous crew and her  skipper manage to survive, and sail on.  In the end, after surviving  harrowing experiences at sea, the U-Boat and her crew meet a very inronic  fate.  <br />The crew has to find even the most basic of supplies to survive.   In one scene, the scruffy captain complains that the ship has plenty of  torpedoes but not a single roll of wire to repair damages. The skipper and  the crew have to improvise and make due with what they have.   <br />As the  crew goes through Gibraltar, anxiety sets in as they sink to the bottom,  only to be saved by a ledge.  Although exhausted, the crew works feverishly  to get the sub moving again.  <br />You will legimately feel sorry for these  sailors and the captain as they struggle to survive.  With the exception of  one &quot;clown,&quot; the crew consists of sailors and officers -- to  include the captain -- who do not hold a very high regard for Der Fuhrer  and the German high command.  Their motive is to accomplish the missions  given to them, and to survive impossible odds.  <br />As an anti-war movie, I  place Das Boot alongside masterpieces such as Dr. Strangelove and Duck  Soup.  &quot;Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Duck Soup&quot; used humor to get  their anti-war message across.  &quot;Das Boot&quot; uses stark realism and  bitter irony.  <br />I strongly recommend this movie.  I also suggest that you  get the German version of this movie (with English Subtitles).  Believe me,  this version will make Das Boot even more hard hitting.  <br />This movie is  full of realistic seat-of-your-pants suspense.  Your eyes will stay glued  to the monitor.  You will even find yourself watching this movie more than  once.  Excellent film!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|I disagree with alot of the negative reviews of this movie. I didn't think it was that bad! I do agree that it lacks from the original star wars. And  they put a alot more into special effects than into characterizations. But  those special effects are excellent. Oscar nominated Liam Neeson was.t that  bad nor his co star but i admit that Little Annakin was pretty bad. And I  DO AGREE that ja ja binks should be dragged out into the road and shot...to  ity bity pieces than fed to birds. That was how bad he was. I really wish  that the film and the original three were available on dvd special  editions...now that would be the ultimate star wars experience! Dont let  some of these reviews give your hopes up. The movie is still high ranking  in the movies that were released that year and better than some of that  other garbage.
0553565915|5.0|This is a great book it gives hope to those who have none. I've read it  many times because it's so nice to read.I gave a book report on it in  highschool.My teacher liked it so much that he thought it would be good for  me to give and oral book report for extra credit. You should read no matter  what religion you are. It's a wonderful book!!!!!!!
B00002E224|5.0|Like a lot of reviews I've already read here, I happened upon this movie  by chance. I'd seen the trailer in the movie theater before and thought  that it looked like it might be interesting but promptly forgot about it.  When I finally rented it I watched it three times in a row the first night.  I couldn't believe the power this movie had over me in the most subtle  ways. I have so many favorite scenes that they change every time someone  asks me what my favorite scenes are. *smile* The scene in the music store  listening booth couldn't have been more natural for these two, and the song  had the same initial effect on me that it had on Jesse (kinda sounded corny  at first, but ended up being quite engaging)...their poet by the  river...and my unchanging favorite, where the movie ends by going back to  each place they visited. Anyone who really liked the ending should consider  watching a film called &quot;Fandango&quot;, which is not only very funny  but has the *other* most beautiful ending I've ever seen. This movie is my  Number One Favorite Movie Ever (that's my own title).
0156907399|5.0|I'm not sure I'm supposed to do this but I'll anyway.  This is the third  time through this novel for me and after I finished my second reading, I  posted my comments here (scroll down some).  <br />This reading, I was  impressed by the relationship between the Ramsey's.  Mr. Ramsey lives in  the world of thought, rationality and verbal sword-play.  But Mrs. Ramsey  lives in the world of the heart; she is a nurturer, the caregiver, very  intelligent, but not caught up in the territorial boundary lines that the  men fight over with words.  Yet Mr. Ramsey, and William Bankes, and Charles  Tansley, they all find her beautiful, they admire her immensely.  What  strikes me is this: Mrs. Ramsey's beauty is an inner beauty of action,  peace, harmony, and balance in her world.  She brooks no false illusions  about her place in the cosmos, she isn't vain, she's thoughtful and  diligent.  The men rely on her for this quality that they do not have in  their own lives.<br />In my last reveiw here, I thought this novel might fit  into the emotional genre of fiction.  Now I'm thinking that it might be the  kind of literature used in marriage counselling.  <br />So, this is a novel  that you can pick up and find something new in the reading.  I need to let  some time pass, but I'll tell you what I think on my next reading, too.
B000005H4K|4.0|Duke Ellington always seemed to accel when teamed with a stellar rhythm section, and what better artists to team with then Max Roach and Charlie Mingus!<br />Indeed, this is an exceptional session, because all three masters are communicating, talking amongst themselves, in a musical debate of sorts. This kind of interplay is truly rare these days.<br />We're all fortunate to have a great recording such as this to remind us that music is magic. <br />'Very Special' takes us on a light hearted journey through a place that introduces us to what is to come musically. Duke touches on a theme and is supported well by Mingus and Roach.<br />'A Little Max' is a Max Roach based piece featuring some intricate and subtle drum work mixed with Duke and Charlie holding their own in support. (2 versions on this CD)<br />'Fleurette Africane' is a very soft and soothing composition in which Duke states the theme and is supported by a very integrated Mingus/Roach background. Overall a very serene and warm number.<br />'REM Blues' on the other hand, is much more brash, with the feel of a night club, the trio expore the realms of downbeat blues and smokey bar rooms. Excellent Bass work by Mingus and great syncopation from all three.<br />'Wig West' is a virtual battle between the three musicians for the title of &quot;coolest&quot;. Unfortunately its a draw. But an entertaining draw!<br />I could go on, but I'll leave the sneak peaks at that. Rest assured though, that there are more unparalled tracks and more glory on this CD than the unwittinging stranger would imagine.<br />Definately a must have!
0784010188|5.0|Terminator 2 is a great follow up from the original Terminator, and even  better. This time Arnold plays a protector for John Connor(Ed Furlong). The  T-1000 played by Robert Patrick is an excellent role, as he looks freaky,  and is a great T-1000.Linda Hamilton plays Sara Connor, another great  performance by her. The sound on the dvd is almost flawless, due to the low  activity in the surrounds, it would get a perfect 5. But the video transfer  IS flawless, almost as good as Fight Club. The music score in T2 is  different as we hear a bunch of noise, that sounds like STOMP, but it fits.  Great Story, And an excellent action movie . A MUST SEE!!!!!!!
B00004TR2G|4.0|I don't know what it was about the brand new collection that did't totally  click. Maybe it was the fact the John Williams went through and fixed the  themes that were too frantic. . .  and messed some other stuff up. . .  stuff that didn't need to be fixed. An example: Wmen Ben Gardener's head  popped out of the boat in the original score, there was a long, loud,  melodic note that was terrifying (even though it was different in the film)  but was completly gone from this score. And what about the exciting stuff  after the main titles in the original score. And John Williams didn't do a  facinating job renaming the tracks. The original was better in that sense.  And Shark Attack is a weird, loud, unorganized track. No wonder it wasn't  featured in the film.<br /> BUT. . . . It is really facinating to finally  have the Empty Raft and the Pier Incident on there. Those truly are two of  the best tracks. The rest is exciting and entertainingly remasterd for the  new listing age. Its because of people Like John Williams and Trevor Rabin,  who keep bringing in great scores that keep instrumental music respected as  it should be.
B000002N3N|4.0|Not since Watermark have I heard Enya so inspired and focused in her  music.  If you have received her efforts since watermark with mixed  feelings, as I have, you will be extremely impressed with The Memory of  Trees.  This CD takes you far away from the monotonous daily grind and  transports you to another world.  In this CD, Enya's rare gift for crafting  uniquely beautiful abstractions into music shines thru in all its  brilliance for the first time in quite awhile.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I was completely blown away by this album. Reunited with guitarist John  Frusciante and producer Rick Rubin, RHCP packed the punch that brought them  fame in the 80s. I bought this album after hearing its first 3 singles.  Their sound never fails to amaze me. Flea's bass and Anthony's unique  poetry always find a new way to express something incredible. Buy it now,  you'll be an RHCP fan for the rest of your life.
B000002IZM|2.0|Vangelis??  How on earth did Ridley Scott come to the conclusion that he  needed Vangelis to do the music to Blade Runner?  Admittedly, the movie has  the greatest cinematography I've seen in a movie in a long time, but the  score just ruins the whole thing!  It's just plain awful!  From annoying  high-pitched synthesizer to a cheesy saxaphone (completely unneccessary!),  this soundtrack is full of complete garbage.  The only plus I'll give it is  adding in the voice overs to accompany the soundtrack; it really spices it  up and makes it just a little bit creepier.  The score by itself with no  voices would sound incredibly bad and dull.<br />  While this soundtrack does  have its fans, I am not one of them.  All I can say is shame on the Blade  Runner crew for choosing Vangelis of all people to do the soundtrack.  This  is one soundtrack to pass up.
1565846117|5.0|Sidetracked was first published in Sweden in 1995, and now with Steven T.  Murray's able translation, the United States audience will be able to read  this Scandinavian thriller/murder mystery.  Henning Mankell's Kurt  Wallander series is very popular in Europe, and Sidetracked won the Best  Crime Novel of the Year award there.  Sidetracked is the third Kurt  Wallander mystery, following Faceless Killers and The White Lioness.  Mankell currently lives in exotic Mozambique.  Inspector Kurt Wallander  works at the police station in Ystad Sweden.  He is divorced, ready to go  on vacation with his girlfriend Baiba, and is undergoing the uncertainty of  a new police chief, possible reorganization of his department, and a rising  caseload.  His nightmare begins with the suicide of an unknown girl in a  farmer's rapeseed field:  &quot;Afterward Wallander would remember the  burning girl in the rapeseed field  the way you remember, with the greatest  reluctance, a distant nightmare you'd  rather forget.  Even though he  seemed to maintain at least an outward sense of calm for the entire evening  and far into the night, later he could recall nothing  but irrelevant  details.  Martinsson, Hansson, and especially Ann-Britt H&ouml;glund  had been  astonished by his impassiveness.  But they couldn't see through the  shield  he had set up to protect himself.  Inside him there was devastation like a  house that had collapsed.&quot;  Wallander's life becomes more  complicated as a series of brutal axe murders surface.  The motis operandi  is basically the same, but with subtle differences.  Wallander becomes  obsessed with stopping the murderer and at the same time identifying the  poor girl who had appeared in the rapeseed field and killed herself in such  pain. Meanwhile, the murders continue, until Wallander becomes aware that  the killer might be focusing on him.  Sidetracked is a complex  psychological thriller and a first rate murder mystery.  It is told in the  epic saga style of Scandinavia, complete with the dark richness of Sweden.  Wallander is human, with limited resources which he stretches for a higher  ideal.  He is a hero.<br />Shelley Glodowski, Reviewerpic saga style of Scandinavia, complete with the dark richness of Sweden.

B000002LCX|5.0|This was the first Smiths albulm that I had ever heard. I have been a  Smiths fan ever since. The first song I ever heard was &quot;A Rush and a  Push and the Land is Ours&quot;. I've been ensnared in Morrissey's eloquent  web ever since. That was seven years ago. My favourite tracks on this CD  are &quot;Death of a Disco Dancer&quot;, &quot;Last Night I Dreamt that  Somebody loved me&quot;, and &quot;I won't share you&quot;. This is an  absolutely fabulous piece of work. Morrissey, you are truly a beautiful  person, and I thank you.
0788811355|4.0|The story is that of an Hungarian map maker employed by the British  government to chart the expanses of the Sahara Desert in the late 1930s.  This is all told in a series of flashbacks after he is dying in 1944,  horribly disfigured by being burned in a plane accident.  He and his nurse,  Juliette Binoche, are living in an bombed out monastery in Italy and  William Dafoe enters the scene with his own haunting memories and revenge  in his heart for Fiennes. Naveen Andray, cast in the role of a Sikh  land-mine specialist adds tension to the mix as he risks his life to  disable mines left behind as a legacy of war.<br />The movie is filled with  great cinematography, extraordinary acting, and a love story told against  the background of War.  Romance is everywhere, not just the romances  between the characters but also the romance of the adventurer. It is also  the story of a hard choice made for love and the terrible price paid for  it.<br />However, I found much to be desired in this film.  At 162 minutes, it  was much too long and moved too slow.  The story was confusing and certain  plot elements were never resolved.  Also, even though Kristin Scott Thomas  is indeed beautiful, I never really felt chemistry between her and Ralph  Fiennes.  I also found it difficult to identify with any of the characters.  And there's an unremitting sadness that is present throughout.<br />As this  movie will probably be a classic I'm glad I saw it. But it  failed to  capture me in its sweep and I felt no emotional connection to it.  If you  haven't seen it already, do see it.  Just don't have high expectations.
068484267X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! I couldn't put it down for the suspence of  what was going to happen next. I really got to know the characters and felt  that I was in the story sharing all their worries of poverty and how the  family were going to survive the next day. The factual book made me realise  how hard it was during the war with so little to eat and so little to  survive on. I would recomend this book to anyone who is willing to read a  true story which is full of emotion and poverty. An excellent book, highly  rated!!
6302426499|5.0|The first time I saw this, I was so exhausted after 30 minutes I turned it  off...I had never seen Tarkovsky before...I was baffled. Because of my  admiration for Rublev's work (and after seeing Solaris &amp; The Stalker..2  films that are &quot;easier&quot;) I gave it another try, and became caught  up in this magical world of flowing images and passionate soul. The love  and faith in this film is overwhelming. Anatoli Solonitzin is wonderful and  so real as Rublev. In black and white, it turns to color at the end when  showing Rublev's extraordinary work (Trinity is my favorite piece of  art).These images somehow put the suffering of the hunger, cold, and war  shown in the the film into perspective, and gives us a joyous celebration  of God's love through art...this film is a masterpiece !
B000002JQ6|5.0|Listening to this CD makes you feel like grabbing a stick and smashing  something...it's that good. Full of energy and some of the best guitar I've  ever heard, this album is one of the best live recordings I've seen, and if  you're new to the band, this is definatley the place to start, as it has  tunes from both the Johnson and Scott eras.<br />My only compaint: Why did  they mess up &quot;The Jack&quot;?
B000002U84|4.0|i listened 2 this album so much when i was younger that it's just what i  got used 2. i actually made faces of horror when i put the cd in my car  player and heard that the first 5 songs had been put thru a cuisinart(the  drivers next 2 me must have thought i was crazy). from what i understand  this is the version that the group likes best. this is the version that  this fan likes least. what's the deal? any of u longtime fans who want 2  buy this cd will be interested 2 know that it's been chopped: 'my own way'  is only drums in the intro and just messed with, period; there are a couple  of musical phrases taken out of lonely in your nightmare, '...wolf' is okay  but the instrumental part in the original beginning doesn't last as long;  and i can't even listen 2 'hold back the rain'. so i still give it 4 stars  because they didn't mess w/new religion, last chance..., save a prayer(a  beautiful song if u really listen), and the chauffeur(really the strangest,  most beautiful structureless song u will ever hear-its neon mystery will  keep u coming back 4 more). i still love this album 18 years later and i  don't appreciate the hack editing that makes it not so good.plus it's also  interesting 2 hear the leap from the 1st album 2 this. and if they wanted 2  mess w/'my own way' then they just shoulda put the night version of it on  here instead of what's on here. still a good listen, but...
B000002N2Z|5.0|Adrenaline is the best album of deftones, I mean the guy can't sing but  when he screams he makes it sound so cool, and the guitarring is the best i  have ever heard and so is the purcussion.
B000000OSE|4.0|[some] say that both of these releases could have been cut up to make one absolute monster of a cd, but the truth is that when a band gets to this stature they all of a sudden have a lot 2 say. some of it may be  garbage some may be gold, but some people like trash and hate gold. that  being said, it's interesting 2 hear all that axl has 2 say, whether it's  sexist, crude, or downright honest. 'don't damn me' has the most honest set  of lyrics i've ever heard and i wish i knew people who lived by these  words. 'november rain' does run 2 long but he's being sensitive here. the  music is updated 'exile on main st.' w/a bit of punk edge. overall a very  worthy release to anyone's collection, fans of axl or no.
6303426468|1.0|I felt nautious watching this movie.  It was just plain bad.  I could not  recommend a film less than this one.   It even tops Jingle all the Way and  Batman &amp; Robin as the worst film ever.
B000000OSG|4.0|both of these releases show why people became fascinated w/this band. it  wasn't because of the great songs or of the notoriety. what people i think  are most interested in is the outlaw image of axl rose, and that is what u  can gather by reading the lyrics he writes. his anti-war protest 'civil  war' ranks as one of their best songs in their small catalog and shows  himself 2 be a conscientious mind, yet a few songs later, in 'get in the  ring' he's challenging bob guccione to fight him and that he'll beat the  stuffing out of him. in 'pretty tied up' he describes a rendezvous w/a  bondage queen, yet in estranged' he talks about loneliness and how stifling  it is. i guess when u had/have the power they do, especially at the time of  this recording relative 2 their fame, u record whatchalike w/no editing. it  can also be said that at least he has emotions and that no human is  consistent w/them. this album is the more epic of the two; 'civil war',  knockin' on heaven's door, and 'estranged' all have a bigness to them. this  should be purchased along w/illusion 1 2 get the full experience.
B000002MI4|5.0|Juliet Letters definitely makes my &quot;desert island&quot; list. If ever  stranded on a desert island (with CD player and a lifetime supply of  batteries, of course) this is one of a handful of recordings I would  choose. Costello's sense of melody, honest theatrics and storytelling is a  rare and welcome gift. And accompanied by the Brodsky String Quartet,  well...Tension, release, complexity, simplicity, the beautiful, the  raffish. And ah, the melodies that strike the heart and live there long  after the music ends. Each time I listen to this CD I am filled with  gratitude and awe.
B000002LCI|5.0|This was the release that did it for Depeche Mode. Powered by such outstanding tracks as Strangelove, Behind The Wheel and Never Let Me Down  Again, Music For The Masses shot these synthpop masters straight into  superstardom. Combined with great production, Depeche Mode themselves have  yet to match this catchy, beautiful recording. A must for any New  Wave/Synthpop collection.
0553269631|1.0|Don't let anyone talk you into reading this book.  It is truly awful.   Anyone who tells you there is some deeper meaning to this book is full of  blasphemy.  I should know.  I wrote a 500-word essay on this book for  Honors English and it got an A, and it was nothing but a tissue of random  guesses on what the author was trying to say.  I don't think anybody knows  what the meaning of this book is.  They just want to act like they can see  something in it that you don't.  Just ignore them and read smomething  interesting! The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is written in a snobby tone that  makes you think you are stupid for not understanding it, but it means  NOTHING!  This book is nothing but a bunch of random, boring scenes in a  bunch of random, boring people's lives.  Avoid it at all costs!
B00000ILDE|4.0|Make no mistake, Aliens is no rehash of the formula from the first film,  it goes well beyond it and becomes it own science fiction classic. With the  return of the only survivor of the first film, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver),  is asked to go back to planet that is the home of the dreaded 'Alien' and  help rescue a group of 'colonists' who have 'disappeared'. She tags along  as an advisor of sorts with a group of interstellar Marines, a bunch of  obnoxious and cocky cowboys. However, they soon discover the unfortunate  fate of the colonists and find themselves in a nightmare showdown with an  army of Aliens that is as suspenseful as anything you will see in movies -  Simply awesome. <br />Top notch FX, even in today's Digital saturated world,  and great direction by James Cameron makes this film a must purchase. The  only complaint I have with this outstanding film is the portrayl of the  Marines. Once the confrontation with the Aliens proves to be more than they  can handle, they dissolve into a bunch of inept wimps - As if the only  thing they had been trained for was to be macho! Regardless of their lack  of experience with these creatures, their training would/should have more  than compensated. Instead, in some kind neo-feminist twist, they owe their  survival to the wit and skill of Ripley - Yeah, right!<br />Anyway, the film  is still great and totally worth owning.
0671034065|4.0|Mr. Perfect is Sam Donovan who has to be one of the best Linda Howard heros in years. Faithful, Nice, Dependable, Steady job and oh yeah ... heh,  heh, hem, ... most of the other Mr. Perfect qualifications too. The dialogs  between Sam and Jaine were zingers and always LOL funny.  And Sexy!  No  one, absolutely no one, writes sexual tension the way Linda Howard does,  and Mr. Perfect doesn't fail the standard.<br />Unfortunately, while the  romance between Jaine and Sam is five-star terrific, the murder mystery is  3 star so-so, and the blood and gore is 1 star Yuck!  I guessed  &quot;whodunnit&quot; immediately, so no surprises there for me.  And the  blood, gore and horror of the murders did not juxtapose well.  Sam and  Jaine deserved a different vehicle for their romance.   <br />Some small  quibbles with the ending of the romance... Jaine's &quot;engagement  problem&quot; was more or less a running gag through the entire book, so  what happened in the end?  Did she and Sam actually make it to the altar?   And what about Sam's new State job?  Did Jaine quit her job to follow Sam?   And what happened with the two houses?  I think an epilogue tieing up these  loose ends was clearly needed and without it the book just didn't seem  finished to me.
B000002MJC|2.0|Depeche Mode in general and frontman Dave Gahan specifically when through  something of an identity crisis with this release. Recorded in a time when  'Grunge Rock' was assualting the music world, 'Songs Of Faith and Devotion'  marks Depeche Mode's departure from their romantic synthpop style  (Violater, Black Celebration), and with its integration of real drums,  heads towards a kind of 'Electro Rock' style. Aside from the beautiful  single 'In Your Room', this release fails to capture the 'catchyness' and  energy they became famous for. 'Faith And Devotion' is the sound of a band  stumbling through a pop culture wasteland in an attempt to stay relevant,  which is frustrating because Depeche Mode were big enough, had they stuck  to their synthpop guns (their source of strength), to alter the music scene  of the 90's.
B000002LA2|4.0|This is a solid overall album, but tends to get a bad rap because of the  time period that it comes from.  In reading the other reviews, I have  noticed a lot of anti-Phil-Collins invective thrown at this record, but  keep in mind that in 1986, Phil was at the top of his game, and was in  demand as a producer and musician.  Clapton, whose career has taken many  twists and turns over the years, was in the midst of his &quot;rock  star&quot; period with large-scale productions like &quot;Behind the  Sun&quot;, &quot;Journeyman&quot; and this one.  Viewed in this light, one  cannot fault his choice of Collins as producer, as he had his finger on the  cultural pulse at the time.<br />The core band (Clapton, Collins, plus studio  heavies Greg Phillinganes and Nathan East) is packed with talent, and the  production is certainly worthy of them (The one lone exception is  &quot;It's in the Way that You Use It&quot;, which was already part of  &quot;The Color of Money&quot; soundtrack and merely added to this album).   Granted, Clapton's guitar work is not as prominent as in his other works,  but it is clear that he put more of himself into the vocals than usual,  especially on &quot;Hung Up on Your Love&quot;, &quot;Miss You&quot;, and  &quot;Holy Mother&quot;.<br />This work may be more slick and polished than  most Clapton afecionados may prefer, but that does not disqualify from  being a good album.  I suspect that most of the criticism of this album  stems more from anti-80s attitudes in general.<br />If you weren't around in  1986 when this album was released, you may not appreciate  &quot;August&quot;, but those of us that were do.
630438551X|5.0|This version of R &amp; J must rate as one of the best. Not just because  of the contempory twist on the story but also because of the great acting.  Fresh faced Dicaprio and Danes are a briliant duo and the suporting actors  make the film all the more dynamic. At first you may feel slightly uneasy  about the use of shakespearian language but by the end you don't really  notice it. Fast paced and exciting, the script and soundtrack make it  accessible to everyone, but the ending still remains a tear-jerking one,  that will leave you believing in true love again.
0790738139|5.0|I'm only 14 years old and I saw L.A.Confidential earlier this year.  In this film, Curtis Hanson (the director) showed life in the early 1950's in such a unique way that overall, topped up to be an excellent and  interesting film.  This is a must-see film for any well-loved fans of  Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce as they all act  and perform outstandingly to produce a well-written piece of work.
B000002KKX|5.0|I remember seeing Barbra Streisand and Michael Jackson sitting in the audience waiting to receive a grammy for there huge hits,&quot;Off the  Wall&quot;and &quot;Guilty,&quot;but all you heard that night was   Christopher Cross's name being called.This debut ablum was a huge hit.Four  of the songs made the top 10.&quot;Ride like the Wind&quot; was the first  single released,but when &quot;Sailing&quot; came out,everyone wanted this  new record.I happen to like Christopher Cross's next album just as  much,even though it wasen't a hit like this record.I seen on amazon that  Christopher has a new album out.I'm going to order this new CD.I miss this  type of music.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Im 14 and saw this film recently.  It was a very complex film with an amazing twist that just seemed to make sense.  Edward Norton's narration  was flawless and Brad Pitt slotted into role as he usually does.  Suave and  stylish direction gave this film a raw edge.  Gets better with every  viewing!

0452270073|5.0|I actually have to review the trilogy as the three books are of a whole.  These books deeply moved me and caused me to question and wonder about  quite a lot of various things. After reading this book, I delved further  into Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and, eventually World War One. As the  &quot;great&quot; war did not concern America until towards the end of that  terrible conflict, it is not as thoroughly discussed as World War II.  It  was an awful, senseless war.  No war can ever really be justified, though  there are always those who come up with some reason or another.  Violence  is never an answer. However, there is no excuse for World War I other than  avarice. And so many died. Yes....this trilogy made me think and review and  re-review my thoughts and feelings on a lot of things. Amazing!
B00000DQSF|5.0|&quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; is such a overlooked album, that was  acclaimed by critics in 1968, but is never thought as as much as 1968's  &quot;The Beatles&quot;. The truth is this album is 30 times better and is  easily up there with &quot;The Doors&quot; or &quot;Are You  Experienced?&quot; as one of the greatest debuts in history. The group is  made up of 5 of the most talented musicians ever to come put of Canada (and  one from U.S.A). Each member plays more than one instrument well, including  Garth Hudson who plays any instrument you can think of! Its just sad that  some of the worst albums get better treatment on C.D! Styx's horrible  &quot;KILROY WAS HERE&quot; gets a wonderful treatment on C.D, while The  Band's amazing albums get bad quality sound and liner notes!
B00000273P|5.0|If there was any justice in this world, Paddy McAloon would be lauded for  his musical genius, in the same breath as Lennon/McCartney. However he  remains an outsider, a songsmith without peer but also one, who for some  reason travels the periphery of pop stardom. This album is the work of a  man at the very peak of his powers, one who stretches the musical  boundaries of the pop song both melodically and lyrically.<br />We get a  number of themes explored on the album from Greek legend, the American Old  West, Elvis to God himself and each theme distinguished with songs of such  beauty. Who could not swoon at &quot;We Let the Stars Go&quot;, jig along  to &quot;Carnival 2000&quot;, waltz to &quot;All the World Loves  Lovers&quot; and jump for the sheer exalted joy of &quot;Moondog&quot;. Yet  it is in the last stanza of the album that McAloon really pulls out the big  guns from the plaintive &quot;One of the Broken&quot; to the most beautiful  song written about heaven &quot;Doo-Wop In Harlem&quot;. All this and the  impossibly superb &quot;Scarlet Nights&quot; which takes the album to  Val-Halla - it positively aches with pure emotion.<br />Any music lover worth  their salt must have this album, if only to hope that the Sprouts could  produce something like this once more.
0767819462|5.0|I can not even say how much I love this movie.It is great.It has  happiness,sadness,anger.All the classic emotions.It stars Susan Sarandon,Ed  Harris,Julia Roberts,Jena Malone,and Liam Alkien.It is about the struggles  between a mother and a stepmother.Throwing in the twist of a serious  illness.It is just great!!!I love it and it is one of my favorite movies of  all time.  :)
0767849493|4.0|OK Kevin, you've made your point! Yes, you are clearly one of most  interesting flimmakers out right now. I've seen all the movies and Dogma  was only an appropriate follow-up to your stream of brutally funny and  intelligent films. <br />Dogma is not for the religiously up-tight or the  squeamish, it's a contraversial treat for the open-minded intellectuals who  know there's more to this experiment called Existence than meets the eye or  soul. Although sometimes Kevin Smith's films get overly talky and in this  one a tad preachy, the light of his magnificent concept is illuminated. It  has most of the usual Smith film elements, tons of vulgar dialogue and a  few consistent characters Jay and Silent Bob. Like all his films, Dogma is  very animated and has the energy and texture of comic books. This film  stirs up a religious stew and may leave many with a sour taste. It has its  moments of sheer lunacy and some may see it as simply a cartoonish  fantasia. But listen closely to the words between the words and thoughts  being provoked and you can see that this comedy on religion, God/Christ,  faith, and myth, is actually a cinematic paradigm of questioning belief  systems. Ha--llejuah!
B00000J2KX|5.0|Having suffered through King's novel, I apprecaite the movie all the more. Kubrick cuts out all the unnecessary background clutter and replaces the  asinine killer topiary animals with the topiary maze.  Watching Nicholson  and Duvall's transformation is creepy. Kubrick doesn't depend on cheap  scares and cliches. He uses the mental breakdown of his subjects to draw us  in to his eerie vision.
0920236162|5.0|I found this children's book very understandable to read, and follow along  with.  The book had great pictures for a easier following of the storyline,  and great illustrations make a book even more of a joy to read.  Being a 19  year old teenager reading a child's novel for the first time in 13 years,  made me remember some of the books I had read as a child.  I think that  this book shows a good example of how to use your brain instead of  fighting.  Children need to be able to see that there are other methods of  resolving a situation without turning to violence.  This book show a good  example of how the princess outsmarted the dragon in order to try to save  the prince.  I think if parents would teach their children this same  methods, then there wouldn't be any violence in schools today.  I salute  the author on this book, and give two thumbs up on a job well done.
0451196716|4.0|The Long Walk is one of a handful of short novels that King wrote under the Bachman pseudonym. It seems to have sprung from the same kernel of  inspiration as the more famous and more hip, but less intense &quot;Running  Man&quot;. Both novels are set in a near-future USA where the most popular  form of public entertainment is watching losing contestants &quot;buy their  ticket&quot; in a diabolical game show spectacle. <br />At the outset, the  central character Garraty, is joined by 99 other hopefuls. The rules are  simple; walk until you drop. Anyone unable to maintain a minimum pace or  who attempts to escape is summarily despatched by the dispassionate  military escorts. Along the way, our hero (who, importantly, is just an  ordinary guy. He is YOU) is touched by friendship (McVries saves his life  and keeps his spirits up), hatred (Barkovitch, who is demonised by the  other contestants and ultimately becomes a pathetic sight, pleading for  reconciliation), pity, horror, contempt, love, bitter humour and even a  numbing morbid ambivalence through his sporadic conversations with the  seemingly unstoppable Stebbins. You will have gathered by now that this is  pretty deep stuff and far from being a typical King novel. The parallels  between the Long Walk and each of our journeys through life are clear and  profound. It made me consider my own mortality on many occasions and I  salute King for achieving the almost perfect balance between exciting  non-stop action and penetrating and memorable allegory.<br />Furthermore, the  book is almost unputdownable. I defy anyone not to feel obliged to complete  it in one sitting. The image of the journey, both physical and metaphorical  is an extremely powerful one. Just like Garraty is compelled to put one  foot in front of the other the reader feels obliged to plough on chapter  after chapter to see what lies around the next corner or who is the next to  drop. And drop they do! I was concerned that King may have his work cut out  to maintain the reader's interest through 99 executions. He does though;  from the spectacularly messy death of the wretched Olsen to the quiet and  poignant demise of the &quot;unknown boy&quot;.<br />For my money, I regard  this as probably King's greatest achievement, so why not top marks then?  Simply because ultimately The Long Walk doesn't quite deliver the goods.  What would have been a very interesting theme - the boys motives for  entering the Walk and the pressure placed upon them from family, friends,  lovers and the wider community, is only touched on very briefly. Most  disappointing of all however, was the denouement. NEVER BEFORE HAVE I FELT  SO CHEATED BY A BOOK'S ENDING!  OK, so we can all guess who's going to win  the Long Walk, but what does the victor chose for his prize? Does he use it  to hit back at authority? Does he even survive long enough to claim it? How  does it affect his relationships and plans, etc, etc, etc? <br />I'm sorry  Stephen King, but after stoking your readers' emotions to such a height,  you should not leave us checking our copies of the book in case some  malevolent person had torn the epilogue out!
6305538018|5.0|Existenz represents an older, mellower, more playful Cronenberg. This is  his first original screenplay since Videodrome and it makes one yearn for  more. <br />It's probably because he is getting older, but gone is the  suicidal rage of Scanners and Videodrome. Existenz is a mind-opening  experience that demands repeated viewings.<br />Those who prefer films like  The Matrix will probably be disappointed by Existenz, as it is  comparatively slow-paced. But those who enjoy films that push boundries and  encourage thought and mind-expansion will be dazzled by Existenz.<br />David  Cronenberg, the mad scientist of the movies, is probably the most socially  relevant director of the last twenty years. No one else has so encouraged  viewers to truly contemplate where modern technology has taken us and how  it has changed our culture. <br />Existenz is not as prophetic as Videodrome,  which I consider to be Cronenberg's masterpiece, but it is nevertheless  superb. My only quibble is that I wished he had not made the plot so  intricate. When looked at as a whole, the wild plot twists make sense, but  they are hard to follow.<br />Check out Existenz. Watch it several times and  then let your mind go. Let it explore. When does life truly become a game?  How is technology altering us? Are games more real than life? How does  virtually reality bleed into everyday situations? Is it possible to confuse  reality and fantasy?<br />These are the questions Cronenberg poses. <br />For a  truly revelatory look at technology, be brave and rent Videodrome, a film  at least twenty years ahead of its time, and one of the most important  films of the last thirty years.
6304466498|5.0|I had to review this movie, I just had to. You'll laugh! Ha ha, ha ha, ha  ha, ha ha. Just buy it.
0316777722|5.0|I often find that when others claim a book is funny, it usually isn't very  humorous.  However, Me Talk Pretty One Day is the exception to this rule.   Sedaris' short essays about small things in life are much like a Seinfield  episode.  His telling style and honesty about himself makes you feel as  humble and as human as he is throughout the book. It is extremley well  done, and it extremley hilarious.
B00003CX59|1.0|It's actually painful to sit through this entire movie. That is, if you're interested in real acting, and not just 'fluffy' special effects (or  staring at Christina Ricci). If you like hack and slash, and decapitations,  you're in for a treat. Heck, if you call gore entertainment, why not just  ask your local butcher if you can spend an afternoon with him? Sickos.  Johnny Depp's acting in this film is HORRIBLE to say the least. If this  were a virtual reality CD-ROM, where one could &quot;enter&quot; into the  world, and actually travel around and explore, that would be great. No  doubt the set design was wonderful, costumes, lighting, etc. Superb. But,  you may as well have cast muppets to run this show. Sadly, the majority of  today's moviegoers have to be dazzled by effects, shocked, and amazed at a  movie. Why not just go back to the days of gladiators? Make a fancy pit for  people to hack each other up in, and there you go, laser lights, effects,  etc. Acting has gone out of the window, and this film shows it. Watch it in  black and white, strip away the effects, and you'll see how PITIFUL it  really is. *YAWN*
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I can't stop humming &quot;Brave New World.&quot;  I was fortunate enough  to see Maiden that the Garden on 8/5/00, and the show was great, you MUST  go see them.  This album brings you back to the days of Piece and  Powerslave with their rythms, and the catchy chorals.  Wicker Man is a  great Inro song, that just grabs you, punches you in the gut, and leaves  you asking, &quot;Thank you sir, can I have another?&quot;  And then they  give you another, and another.  <br />UP THE IRONS!
0784011206|3.0|John Rambo doesn't have much to say.  He's just a wanderer who entered a small town where they don't like Drifters much.  <br />In many movies Brian  Dennehy would be the typical badguy.  He would be sort of like the fascist  Donald Sutherland &quot;warden&quot; character in that Stallone prison film  &quot;Lock down&quot;.  But he's not.  In fact many people would probably  tell him that he's doing a good job, keeping the vagrants out in a  professional manner.<br />However, John Rambo is not the usual bum.  He has  flashbacks and can't tell the difference between Vietnamese Captains and  Chris Mulkey.  Sylvester Stallone has a great physical presense in this  movie.  You believe that he is a hardened Green Beret who can go through 10  cops without breaking a sweat.  And his &quot;escape&quot; is well handled  as well, with the magnificient West coast forests providing great  scenery.<br />The movie gets the message across that there are no good guys  and no bad guys, just victims.  John Rambo is a victim of the US Government  who trained him to be a killing machine then abandons him, leaving him with  nightmares and a body full of scars and signs of Agent Orange.  That and  the fact he can't get a job and his fellow American hates the &quot;Child  murderers&quot; of Vietnam.<br />And the police are victims as well, having to  capture/kill this unstable killing machine.  <br />The DVD is a clean copy and  it has a difficult job.  It has to high light the mistiness of the Oregon  forrest, as well as provide good contrast between the background and  foreground.  While other discs do a better job (ie. Last of the Mohicans),  this is a acceptable transfer.  The sound is good as well.  However it is  unfortunate that they left the last song to go to Sly's brother Frank.  He  stinks as a singer and actor...<br />Rating: C+
B00004U45G|4.0|This may be the best live versions of many of these Zepp songs ever recorded. Let's face it, some of their studio work, sound quality wise, was  lacking. But here they are beautifully presented with all the force and  energy that was written into them. Robinson's vocals are great, his  &quot;Heyyyy Ho&quot; is superb. Onto guitars, now Jimmy has help in the  rhythm department, beats playing both lead and rhythm on stage, another  plus. &quot; Noboby's Fault...&quot; is my favorite here, complete with  harmonica. WOW, play this one wide open. This cd just doesn't dissapoint,  its a great tribute to many great songs, don't miss it. Why not five stars?  Some of the old blues songs didn't do a thing for me, sorry.
0780628551|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie.  You are entertained throughout, even though it's not surprising.  Johnny Depp is a superb actor in all of his roles,  but this is the first time I've found him soooo attractive.  Charlize  Theron does pretty well, in a role very similar to hers in the Devil's  Advocate.<br />So here's the story... Depp and Theron are married and he is an  astronaut about to go out to space on a mission.  She's sad, doesn't want  him to go...  Something happens while he's out there, and you really don't  have a doubt what it was if you've watched any x-files episodes.<br />He comes  back, there's a really intense love scene between the two, and she gets  pregnant with twins.  I've seen correlations here between this movie and  Rosemary's Baby, but I don't think that is at all the case.  Theron starts  to wonder what's up with him, and that's when all hell breaks loose.<br />I  loved it.  Worth at LEAST a rent.  :-)
B00002DEMV|5.0|There's really no other way to describe this album.  Everything is just  perfect.  The best album I've bought in very long time!  Tarja's voice is  amazing.  The best songs are 'The Pharaoh Sails To Orion',  'Gethsemane'  and 'Sacrament Of Wilderness'.  Truly amazing, and definetly worth it!  For  anyone who likes Gothic Metal/Melodic Power Metal!
B000001C6M|5.0|Well, this is my first Slayer album, I wasn't sure what to expect, but having listened to it, I am nowhere near disappointed.  Wow, this album is  fast, heavy, incredible.  From what I've heard (from other albums), it's  easily their best.  I know, I said in my &quot;Seasons&quot; review that it  was probably better, but that was before I properly listened to this one.  Kerry King is one incredible guitarist.  The first solo you hear (in  &quot;Evil Has No Boundaries&quot;) is kind of sloppy, but King shows off  his abilities to their fullest on songs such as &quot;Metal Storm&quot; and  &quot;Final Command&quot;.  &quot;Metal Storm&quot; is the finest moment on  the album, simply breathtaking (and, in case anyone cares, it's exactly the  same length as the intro to &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, right down  to the second).  As for complaints, there could be a bit more melody in it,  just so we don't collapse to the floor while jumping around to it.  But,  other than that, great album.  Say what you will about &quot;Reign in  Blood&quot;, it has its high points, but it doesn't compare to this thrash  metal masterpiece.  Oh, and if you don't have this album or Metallica's  &quot;Kill Em All&quot;, I suggest buying them at the same time, they  compliment each other quite nicely.  Slayer isn't the easiest band to get  into, but give them time, they are truly talented.  Hail Slayer!
0375703764|4.0|This novel seems to me not at all a suspense thriller or even a tale of  the supernatural, but rather a commentary on the difficulties, hang-ups and  rediculous situations inherent in writing (or filming) a scholarly work.   And for someone who has written quite a few papers... well, I laughed out  loud at some of Zampano's conventions (especially the footnotes - how many  of us have made up a few to identify some imaginary research of our own??).   I was impressed beyond belief by this novel, and give Danielewski an  enormous amount of credit for making a statement like this in his first  novel. God help him when it comes to writing the second...
0792842723|5.0|Pierce Brosnan did an excellent job as bond. I mean he isn't as good as  sean connery but what bond ever is. The movie was exxcellent it had a good  villan Sean Bean's was the best bad guy the bond movie has had since jaws.  It had an excellent bond girl in this movie she was beautiful and smart.  The only thing i didnt like about this movie was that he didnt blow up his  car or fight anybody in his car he just drove to cuba in it. I mean it was  a great car but there was no car chase seen but the movie was great  anyway.I hope brosnan will come back to make several more bond movies. I  have yet to see Tommorow Never Dies and World is not Enough but after  seeing golden eye i am eager to see those movies also.
B00003W8NM|4.0|After reading the Palahniuk novel several weekends before first seeing this movie I was very excited, I figured that Fincher would not be one to  shy away from the intense emotion and pain in the book...I was wrong. While  this movie is still very intense and a decent representation of the book, I  feel that they could have done more. If you enjoy this movie I urge you to  give the book a shot, you won't be sorry.
630575067X|5.0|This was a great movie it isnt as good as the originals but it comes  close. This movie had plenty of action and drama of a sort. It had no  romance in it at all but thats not what star wars is about. There are some  flaws to this movie though. To me there were to many special effects in  this movie i mean the movie was excellent but there were to many special  effects. The story line wasnt great but it was good. Other than these small  flaws thismovie is excellent i recommend that u buy this movie at once if u  dont you'll be missin out on the best movie of 99.
6300215717|5.0|God bless Audrey Hepburn! And whoever wrote this movie: &quot;I will enter her sickroom disguised as a thermometer!&quot;<br />She and Gregory Peck make  a beautiful couple at the end of this lovely movie, the story of a  sheltered, frustrated young princess who breaks loose for a single day.  This is a beautiful, romantic movie with a bittersweet tone and lots of  comic moments.<br />Young Princess Anne is touring Europe to promote trade  relations, but she is also slowly starting to crack under the pressure of  her regimented, scheduled lifestyle. Every word she utters in public has  been scripted for her.<br />Everything that she wants to do can't be done,  from wearing pajamas to leaving without an escort to going to a window  without her slippers on. One touching scene shows Anne staring out at a  bunch of ordinary young men and women dancing in the streets of Rome. But  when a doctor sedates her during a fit of hysteria, it produces odd  effects-Anne seems to be drunk, and heads out of the Embassy to have fun.<br />But soon she bumps into a hardened journalist who takes the  seemingly-soaked girl under his wing. And as he advises her to enjoy  herself for a day (including cutting her hair and driving a  motorcycle-badly) he begins to fall in love with her.<br />The funny bits are  scattered throughout this-Hepburn's &quot;drunk&quot; scenes alone are  worth the movie. But also there is the cab driver giving Peck his family  history, the ad-libbed scene at the &quot;mouth of truth&quot; where you  can see the idea forming in Peck's head (Hepburn's voice drops for a  moment-presumably she didn't think they'd use that take), the scene where  Anne loses her shoe, the scene where the cleaning lady finds Anne showering  in Peck's apartment, and so on.<br />I don't think Elizabeth Taylor and Cary  Grant could have handled the waifish, wide-smiled princess and the  rough-edged reporter the way these two can.<br />This is a fairy tale about a  princess and a poor reporter with a realistic ending-if Peck and Hepburn  had sprinted off into the sunset to pursue true love, then the movie would  have been forgotten. But they chose to make it real, and so made it a  classic.orter with a realistic ending-if Peck and Hepburn  had sprinted off into the sunset to pursue true love, then the movie would  have been forgotten.

0812548094|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It took right off where Wizards First Rule  ended, and continued to capture my attention. Total action from beginning  to end, like the rest of the series! I thought this one was the best (so  far) in the series because you really get to know the characters better in  this, the second book. Terry Goodkind has made me a fan of Fantasy when I  thought I never would be. I highly recommend this book, and even though  each book is written to stand alone, I suggest you start at the beginning  of the story of Richard, Kahlan, Zedd and the others in Wizards First Rule.
B000003TAR|5.0|After &quot;Nevermind&quot;, it's hard to make a follow up, but &quot;In Utero&quot; is classic alternative rock and doesn't skimp on awesome  lyrics.  This album is hard driving rock yet with little subtle tracks of  acoustics (foreshadowing, anyone?) that just give you opportune moments to  reflect.  Kurt Cobain might not have know it, but he and the band really  know how to make an excellent record.  <br />The album kicks off with the hard  alt sound of screeching guitars on &quot;Serve The Servants&quot;.  Hard  rock with smart lyrics that are winning.  The hard Nirvana sound continues  on the mellow verses and severely impressive choruses on &quot;Heart Shaped  Box&quot;.  Maybe their best single release.  Hard goodness continues on  tracks like &quot;Very Ape&quot; and the remarkable playing on &quot;Milk  It&quot;.  Other than the real hard Seattle sound that they are know for,  the group really mellows out on the music front with some more toned down  rock numbers with intelligent songwriting and fine tuned musicianship.   &quot;Dumb&quot; is the best example of this blend of softer but still very  hard music that gives you insight into the thought process of Kurt.  While  some of the artist of the time and type of music could be misinterpreted as  just some garage band that can't really play anything and just wants fame.   They're true artists and on a rock masterpiece like &quot;All  Apologies&quot; that starts off with a inflection and then gets into really  powerful rock, this is proved.  The introspective words are deep and very  meaningful.  &quot;Rape Me&quot; is another great piece that proves their  range.<br />The group was headed for really greatness on this album and I  think it didn't really get the credit it deserved.  It's a new side of the  band that's very cleaver.  The heavy sound combined with truly vivid  wordings make a great combination.  The album is the future of alternative  with more than just great pop rock (although that's very present), but with  significant songs that are not too dumbed down for the audience and aren't  bigger than life pretentiousness.  I think even better than this grand  album is the tunes made totally stripped down in there  &quot;Unplugged&quot; set.  This is the ultimate for rock fans, but I would  get the &quot;Unplugged In New York&quot; set first to here the songs done  in a softer tone.
0380788624|1.0|This is an instance of where once again the author's name is required to sell this puppy.  If you like those books where incredible coincidences  happen on a fairly regular basis, this book is for you.  Grandpa's work  together, two superheros in the world of the motals.  They split and never  see one another again, yet grandson and granddaughter hook up for rousing  great fun, out in the miidle of nowhere.it fairly takes the breath away.   No wonder all these folks crave cryptography, you cannot go ten pages  without ANOTHER amazing coincidence.  We see Turing, we see Nazis, we see  computer designers and not only do the know each other intimately, but they  almost live in each others heads.  A long slog through the dark and stormy  night...
B00003CWPR|4.0|I think that Kubrick knew that this would be his last film. He chose to make Eyes Wide Shut, forever leaving his version of AI in that misty region  of lost classics and hearsay. This dramatic decision raises logical  questions, since AI promised to be a much more bravura film, but Eyes Wide  Shut offers something not seen so vigorously in any other Kubrick work - a  retrospective look at the autuer's cinematic catalogue. Virtually any  official Kubrick film after Spartacus is alluded to: the costume shop  Lolita, the circle of power similar to the War Room staging in Dr.  Strangelove (in fact, the toy shop in the end continues this motif with a  flurry of circles, including a halo of light bulbs over a toy display), the  unblinking camera eye at the gate reminiscent of Hal from 2001: A Space  Odyssey, masks and aggressive sex a la A Clockwork Orange, the accumulation  of antiques, opulent finery and a distant aristocracy - with period setting  and costume - from Barry Lyndon, the endangerment of wife and single child  from The Shining, and the use of the bathroom as den of deadly, dire  consequence - along with the playful three word title - from Full Metal  Jacket. If this film is therefore looked upon as a deliberate coda from a  prescient Artist, then it is made all the more interesting in what it adds  to Kubrick's canon - the power, mystery and implied threat of the strong  Woman. Nicole Kidman holds great power over Tom Cruise throughout the film,  which she opens while stripping. The last word uttered in the film is hers,  and it is a mechanical, unidealized reference to the most intimate physical  bond between man and woman. Sexual allusions abound in all of Kubrick's  films; Strangelove has no major female characters yet sexual innuendo works  its way into everyone's names and is the motivating cause for world  disaster. Alice Harford is the specter over all of Kubrick's work - Woman  who gives man his subconscious desire to achieve while offering the  reassuring appearance of domestic complacency, yet Her true secrets are as  vast as 2001's Monoliths while never losing the potential for sinister  efficiency.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Before attempting to show readers some sort of valid insight into this album I'd like to hear more Elliott Smith, so if your reading this and you're from Amazon.com, please withdraw my Elliott Smith review.  Otherwise, you could just post this, that would be neat.
1878424114|5.0|This book is outstanding!  Deepak Chopra is one of my favorite authors and  out of all his work I find this to be his best.  These spiritual principles  are so simple and wise that if followed they really can help you find  internal and external success.  In this book Dr. Chopra's starts with  teaching us the law of pure potential which we all have and we must access  to live a full and fulfilled life.  He goes on to teach us about giving,  choices, harmony, detachment and most importantly the law of intention and  finding our purpose in life.  I urge you to read all of Dr. Chopra's work  but especially this book.
1878424319|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I was a little disappointed.  I  felt the way one reviewer did that the truths were rather simple and  obvious.  However, I noticed that as I read a few pages each day, my  attitude started changing.  I started feeling less annoyed with people I am  always annoyed with and felt less of a need to fight the battles that I  always feel a need to fight.  It really made me consider that somebody  else's truth is not my truth, and there is no need to take it personally or  become angry about it.  Even though these truths are somewhat obvious, we  seldom actually make them a reality in our lives, and things don't change  until we do.<br />I really love the cover of this book and the texture.  I  think it's a beautiful book!
B000009O8A|5.0|What was I expecting?<br />When I picked up this title, I noticed two things: the words &quot;I spit on your grave&quot; in blood-shot red; and a  scantilly clad lady with a knife in her hand.  I thought, &quot;Well, this  is just one more slasher film.  Probably so bad you'll have to  laugh.&quot;<br />Boy, was I dead wrong.<br />I Spit on Your Grave is one of the  most disturbing, terrifying and thought-provoking movies I have ever seen.   It begins quite peacefully when Jenny (Camille Keaton) arrives in the  country to write a book.  She's rented a cottage by the river.  Pretty,  slender, and from the big city, she catches the eye of four locals.  They  try to catch her attention, but appropriately, she ignores them.<br />Unhappy  that she has refused them, the four decide to teach her a lesson.  One day,  while she is in her little canoe sunning, they come by in a motor boat and  take her away, against her will, to a hidden part of the woods.  I can't  even begin to describe what happens in this movie's next chapter.  All I  will say is that I was horrified, petrified and practically moved to tears.   If you cannot imagine what it is like to be helpless and at other people's  mercy, just watch this movie.<br />One of the four guys orders one of the  others to kill her so she won't witness against them.  Unbeknownst to the  other three, the supposed killer is unable to complete his task.  Presumed  dead by the three, she slowly recovers from her injuries.  Once recovered,  she only has one purpose in her mind and heart.<br />One by one, she plots the  death of her four attackers.  What is amazing in this movie, is that during  each act of revenge, you wonder whether or not she will  succeed.<br />Brilliantly directed and acted, I Spit on Your Grave is a  classic.  Camille Keaton's performance is so stunning the whole thing seems  like it is actually happening.  You just don't get performances like this  from Meryl Streep or Sally Field.  This is raw and real.  But be warned,  this is NOT for the faint of heart.
0684800713|5.0|Okay, in terms of literature, I'm not very appreciative of the great works  of English literature.  I was one of those guys that hated English class,  and believed Cliff Notes were a great substitute for the real deal.  That's  why it's out of character for me to recommend this book.<br />If anyone has  read my other reviews, I love plot, action, fluidity, and dialogue.  This  book is the exact opposite, but yet I loved it.  It takes about 50 pages to  get used to Hemingway's style (this is the first I've ever read any of his  books), but once accustomed to it, the amount of detail is  fantastic.<br />This book makes reader feel like they're in Pamplona, in the  bullfights, at the parties, and drinking the wines.  It's amazing.   Hemingway paints a picture of Spain that can not be matched.  The Spanish  tourism board should hand this book out instead of a standard  brochure.<br />Though the language style is a bit terse, and the plot is  almost non-existent, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
0449002632|1.0|Repeated beatings with a stick to the head are more fun than reading this  novel.  I had to read Rutherford's other novel, Sarum, for History class  and experienced the same results.  The scenes in London become dull and  repetative after the first 300 pages or so(there are 1,100 all together).
6301767772|5.0|This is some of the best work that Sylvester Stallone has ever done.  I am  sure that many people have seen these movies before, but there is nothing  like it when you watch it in digital sound.  These movies have been  digitally remastered, so the experience is nothing like the originals.  I  gave these movies 5 stars since they are so action packed.  They do not  make movies like these anymore.
B00004U9MS|3.0|Coldplay is but an ordinary brit-pop band with some beautiful&amp; catchy  melodies like the songs &quot; yellow&quot;&amp;&quot;sparks&quot;,but  other tracks are all too familiar.they can't be compared to Radiohead which  is a lengend due to Thom Yorke.
0783117388|5.0|In fact, all the actresses on this great show do.  The last time (and the only time) I have seen a cast this great work was on the network show  Freaks and Geeks, but of course most people couldn't take a show that is  both unflinching and honest.  The only reason this show is on is because  the brave ones at HBO know what a intelligent show is and are willing to  give it time.  Now as a man, I am probably not expected to like this but  good is good and did I mention that Kim Cattral rules?
B000001GBJ|1.0|i bought this cd  &amp; &quot;white stone&quot; at the same time  thinking  their music might help me to relax during my exam period,but both turned  out to be so artifical &amp; imitative &amp; all-too-common that bored me  to death instead of soothing me.i sold it right away, i'd rather listen to  those   classic &quot;best of piano pieces&quot; or &quot;moonlight album  &quot;,at least they're written by real genius musicians like Chopin .
B00002Z88D|5.0|Being a Metallica fan since the mid 80's, starting with Ride the  lightning, I have, or at least feel as though I have, grown up with the  Mighty Met.  Many of you probably feel the same, and each of us I am sure  has their own personal favorite tracks from the slew of CD's that the guys  have produced. For a long time my favorite CD the entire way through was  Master, but S&amp;M has taken the title away.  Obviously, it helps to put  new recordings on a few of my favorite songs, do them live, and then have  the CD produced in such a way that each of the instruments has a distinct,  um I don't really know how to say this, listening ability.  Meaning, that I  can hear each instrument very clearly through the recording, and the  vocals, and the crowd.  And the best thing about the entire album is, of  course, the Symphony.  And, it is each of those instruments I am referring  to, you can hear them.  Big Bonus, as many of us are not only metalheads,  but we have a background in, and an appreciation for, classical music.  To  have one of the best Metal bands ever team up with, and harmonize if you  will, with one of the best symphonies of today is astounding. One of the  best things about this album is the rich fullness that the Symphony gives  the music, making you wonder how it could have ever been interesting the  other way....  However, when the two are actually moving back and forth  with the main force in a song is where you may get the best feel for the  album.  I challenge any person who is a Metallica fan to tell me that they  do not enjoy listening to For Whom the Bell Tolls on S&amp;M.  It's just so  much better, in all ways.  Absolutely Awesome, and if you don't have it  yet, click that button for adding it to the cart, you won't regret it.  I  promise ya.
B000020617|2.0|I love dear ol'Bon Jovi - sometimes, but this time I was going to buy Foo  Fighters. Something went wrong, however.<br />That's not bad that we had that  heavily overplayed radio hit called Learn to fly. That's great we got that  MTV's piece of art named Breakout. Everybody including myself must have  felt happy about this new the foos' album. Has it met all the expectations?  It hardly could - for one simple reason: everybody still remembers The  Colour &amp; The Shape, and everybody is rather still sure there was much  less sugar in it.<br />Too poppy may not necessarily mean too bad, it is just  too sweet which still attracts the real fans of the foos (how much sweet  should it be to disappoint all of them?)<br />As for the tracks, no need to  talk about the above mentioned hits. Stacked actors, Headwires, Gimme  stitches, MIA and even Next year are really something - considering the  rest of the staff on the cd. They are good, and - of course sweet, and  nice, and poppy, in short, you have a big chance to love them, and even  other songs, - in case, if you are not too conservative about the  foos.<br />Everybody has a right to be commercial. The foos used to be  commercial their own way. Now the way has changed. I'm afraid of their next  album.
B00003ZKSP|5.0|Slipknot is, if not the best, one of the best bands I have ever seen or  heard.  There was a lot of hype about them at my school, so I bought the  album, I was skeptical at first... but Slipknot rocks! If your style of  music is rock, punk, rap, hardcore, WHATEVER, you'll love this band!!  JUST  BUY THE ALBUM!
B00004U8PA|4.0|I first heard of Rocky Horror Picture Show (RHPS), back in the early 1980's when I saw a glimpse of it in the movie FAME, and wondered where you  saw it.  I first went to see RHPS back in 1986, in Allentown, Pennsylvania,  where I immediately fell in love with the movie, and in 1998 I joined the  &quot;Floor Show&quot; in Austin, Texas.  I enjoyed the entire Rocky Horror  experience, and recommend to anyone that before watching it on video to go  to the nearest theater that plays the movie and has a floor show, to lose  your RHPS virginity, the proper way.  If you don't have a theater in your  area that plays the movie, then the video will be an excellent substitute,  and ask the theater managers why they don't show it, as this movie has been  a cult favorite for over 20 years now, and is worth any price. Dream it at  home, be it at the theater!
B000002MG1|5.0|This album is one of the most timeless albums in my collection. If I had  this on vinyl I would have played it 'till finally all you heard was a long  scratch. &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; goes all over place and ends  with pure shine. <br />It opens with the mysterious &quot;Drive&quot; which  could be described by the music video, simple but complex. Then dives into  the faster paced &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot;. Followed by &quot;The  Sidewinder sleep&quot; which is a very poppy single with catchy lyrics and  will want you to get dancing like Micheal Stipe on stage. The album then  reaches into the center of &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; and echos  &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, R.E.M.'s big ballad that has helped alot of  people through the &quot;hard times&quot; and from the bittersweet past  track we get &quot;New Orleans Instrumental Number 1&quot;, A beautiful  simple instrumental that leads us into the bittersweet depressing  &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; with great lyrics on living life and has a  great echoing guitar effect. Followed by &quot;Money Got A Raw Deal&quot;,  &quot;Ignoreland&quot; and &quot;Star Me Kitten&quot;.<br />To me  &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; has one of the best album endings. The  Fun Witty lyrics &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; paying tribute to the ever  entertaing Andy Kuafman. Then we reach the two most beautiful songs on the  album &quot;Nightswimming&quot; and &quot;Find The River&quot;. I won't go  in much detail anymore, just buy this album. You won't be disapointed
6305126062|4.0|Well, not quite.  When one thinks about it, it's about hope, redemption  and the saving of souls.  It's about a family who's been torn apart through  a grizzly accident, leaving one teenage girl dead, and another teenage girl  and her prized horse mangled (both physically and mentally).  It's about a  family's thinly veiled serenity being suddenly unmasked, and in the wake  exposes a great vulnerability that lets loose the undercurrent of  depression, frustration and hostility.<br />Annie (Kristin Thomas), a  head-strong, high-pressure magazine editor and world traveler is suddenly  (and maybe for the first time) faced with something she is totally  unprepared to handle--losing her daughter.  Seeing the ever widening gulf,  she becomes desperate enough to leave New York and seek help from an  unusual animal healer, Tom Booker (Robert Redford), a so-called horse  whisperer.   Throwing caution to the wind, and against her husband's wishes  (nicely played by Sam Neil), Annie forces Grace (her daughter) to accompany  her and Pilgrim (Grace's horse) to a small ranch in the vastly open and  rugged state of Montana.<br />This is where the pace of the movie suddenly  changes from the beehive of \\"civilization\\" to one of sedate morning dew,  deep blue skies, rugged mountain sunsets, and the home-spun reality of a  rancher's way of life.  Booker, who quickly realizes that he has much more  than just a horse to heal, reluctantly takes on the chore.  What follows is  a deliberately paced process of healing.<br />Although this laid-back movie  may not be to everyones' taste (or patience), it worked its magic on me.   Between 1 and 10, I give \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" an 8.  It's a shame we don't  see more of Robert Redford, either behind the scenes as a director, or in  front of the camera.
B00000064G|5.0|I remmber the day clearly when I first heard this record. I was in a  record store( Live music? in Berkely) and they had a listening section. The  cover really fancied me and I decided to give it a listen. I fell in love  with it from the first strings. I listened to the whole album and that day  &quot;Pink Moon&quot; was in my head everywhere I went. I finally bought it  and I still feel the same about this record. It has the imagaination of a  Lewis Carrol work mixed with a haunting depression that Dylan could only  reach a few times. In my life I have only met less than a handful of Nick  Drake fans and one day I was cleaning my room and from the T.V. in the  other room I heard &quot;Pink Moon&quot; and saw it on a car commerical.  Atleast that gives me a feeling some people know Nick Drake. This album  just does something to you inside. You'll just have to buy it and see.
0767824571|5.0|What a hilarious movie!  A great addition to your dvd collection!
B000002C25|4.0|With the release of &quot;Be Here Now&quot; Oasis were giants and the  world stood to see what was next for the cocaine snorting-groupie shagging  Rock N' Roll Animals. What we got was a giant Rock N Roll epic that went to  the loudest and fullest sound Oasis had ever gone to. While still sticking  to the basics with a notch louder Oasis experimented with such songs as  &quot;D'ya Know What I Mean?&quot; reycling chords from  &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and doing a slide guitar track with Johnny Depp on  &quot;Fade In/Out&quot;. This album however doesn't sound all new, we get  tracks like beautiful &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Away&quot;  which is like an updated version of &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. Also a touching  tribute to Noel's wife Meg &quot;The Girl With The Dirty Shirt&quot;. The  only weak tracks I feel on this album are &quot;I Hope I Think I Know&quot;  and &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. &quot;Be Here Now&quot; ends in a blaze with  the song-along epic ending oasis album song with &quot;All Around The  World&quot; than when you think its over it comes back with an encore of  &quot;It's Getting Better(Man)&quot; and the ends on a light note with a  little muzik instrumental version of &quot;All Around The World&quot;. I do  admit this song was a little too loud and overdone which is what kept it  from being a classic. Its still worth getting though because singles like  these don't come along alot these days.
0780624890|5.0|If you like a great movie with great extra's this is the movie for you.  I  think this is one of the best vampire movies to come out in a long while.   And the many many many extra's on this dvd make it an example for other  companies to follow.  Get it!
B0000017CA|5.0|acid bath is one of my all-time favorite bands ever.  its a rather evil  and sinister sounding band but yet in a mellow way, don't get me wrong this  band has some kicken heavy music too.  the lyrics read like a dark well  thought out poem and the singer's voice is like none i've ever heard  before. this band would of made it extremely far if one of the members  hadn't of died. This cd is a must have and if ya don't like it, you must be  brain dead!! =)  -  Firewitch Blackrose
B00004NRWH|5.0|I had the chance to see Nickleback as an opening act at a concert recently  and was blown away by their stage presence.  I immediately had to get the  CD the next day, and I must say I am glad that I did.  Their lyrics have an  edge, and their music is hard hitting.  I just can't seem to get enough of  this CD, mostly &quot;Leader of Men,&quot;  and &quot;Worthy to  Say.&quot;<br />If this is how Nickleback is going to start out, they are  going to have many years on the charts if they rock this hard!!!
B00000ADG2|1.0|i would give this less cuz shes a terrible person and artist...the only  reason i bought this cd is because she said she would rather have her kids  starve then a white person get her cd...well....im waiting!!!!!
B00000JPH0|5.0|&quot;Winter War&quot; (Talvisota in Finnish)is the story of the 1939-40  Russo-Finnish War seen through the eyes of a reserve infantry unit.  We see  them leaving their farms on mobilization, to assembly at the border, and  follow them into battle until the armistice some 110 days later.  To most  Americans who know anything about it, the Winter War is visions of Sissi  skiing rings around Russians. True that did happen, but the majority of  Finnish units operated conventionally either in the Mannerheim Line or to  the North/North East of it.  This is what this film describes.  The battle  scenes are as authentic as any in Saving Private Ryan; if memory serves the  &quot;Soviet&quot; Forces are Russian extras.  Vehicles, weapons, uniforms  are all entirely accurate.   It's probably fair to consider this movie as  Finland's SPR.  Whereas some have criticized SPR for it's somewhat  contrived plot, this movie has none of that; simply citizen soldiers called  to save their nation.  We watch as more and more of their friends are  killed and wounded, in relentless Red Army assaults.  This sense of loss is  brought home again simply, but elegantly, in the scenes with the &quot;home  front&quot;.  The final anticlimatic news of the armistice on the troops is  depressing to see, but again entirely accurate. This film is a fitting  tribute to the Finnish &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; who also did nothing  less than save their nation- twice in 5 years from Soviet enslavement.
0871137380|5.0|This book brought it all back. I was in Mogadishu during Bloody Sunday, as  an Air Force medic stationed at the Mogadishu Airport. The Rangers lived  across the small road from us in a hanger. Many of the pilots and some  Rangers made pretty good friends with us. Although I was not close to any  in paticular. But I knew the faces. Our small Mobile Aeromedical Staging  Facility(MASF) was the closes medical facility near the area of battle. We  recieved all the casualties. Although we were not equipped for such a mass  casualty, we somehow pulled it off, no sleep. Some of my fellow medics were  brought to tears when seeing the men they were laughing with the day before  now bleeding in front of them. My hat is off to them and the Rangers, Delta  Force, Combat Controllers and Pararescue who were involved in a day we will  not soon forget. I have said it before, but thanks Mr Bowden.   OUT.
B00000JCOV|5.0|The moment that (sic)started playing, I knew this cd was awesome.  It's  got great guitar, purcussion, and singing.  Corey(8) can switch from  screaming to singing in fractions of a second.  If you can try to get the  one with Purity on it.  This band is the heaviest on the planet.  I saw  them live on the Tattoo The Earth Tour and they were amazing.  This cd is a  must buy for any hardcore fans, and if you can go see them live!
0671034065|5.0|So what if Mr. Perfect has a predictable murder plot - despite all its  flaws, Linda Howard with her previous bestseller All the Queen's Men has  never been so lyrical and hilarious in her narrative. Mr. Perfect is  unabashedly entertaining with Jaine Bright as the witty and feisty heroine  who, with her friends in their reverie, stumbles upon a provocative topic -  qualities of a perfect mate. From there, it is refreshing and all buoyant  humour - TJ, Luna and Marci with Jaine chalks up a list that spreads  rampantly like diaspora through the Internet and become embroiled in media  frenzy as Marci slipped her tongue to one of her colleague. The  &quot;perfect storm&quot; in the speculation rages on. <br />Never once a  moment banal, Jaine Bright is suitably energetic and is a believable  character - and her chemistry with Sam Donovan - a neighbour cop is  scintillating and effervescent. They fall in love with incendiary  sensuality and fierce emotions; beautifully contrasted against the  recovered love between TJ and her husband Galan - which is all tender and  heartwarming. Despite all its unbridled fun, there is a core for humanity  and love. Romance readers will be swarming to the picture perfect scenario  of Sam and Jaine.<br />The murder plot may not be perfect murder but it is  credible with all the guessing of who-dun-it when Marci is killed. A psycho  killer Corin is in the lurks with his twisted mind. Grisly. Morbid. I  wouldn't want to spoil the fun for you by revealing his identity. It keeps  the story going and spiced up with passionate love scenes between Jaine and  Sam, you wouldn't want the book to end. Linda Howard is a master of the  romance genre and with the hilarious banters, it is all seductive pleasure  at its best - and you will religiously believe that Ms. Howard is a  perfectionist in her writing.
6304789440|5.0|This is the best sci-fi horror movie ever made.  It isn't no where near as  dark as the first one and had a great script to back it up.  This one had  far better special effects then the original but then again it was seven  years later.  Instead of one alien they create a legion of them over  running a city that is now gone cause of them.  Segourney Weaver gives an  outstanding performance along with Micheal Bein, Bill Paxton and Paul  Rieser.  The scene where Ripley takes on the Mother Alien is thrilling on  the edge of your seat entertainment.  James Cameron knew what he was doing  to put out a movie like this.
6305399212|4.0|After 1979's bone-chilling, gut-wrenching, terrifying film Alien comes the impressive (and quite possibly superior) sequel Aliens.  The story is that  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, whom was nominated for Best Actress) is back on  Earth and is asked to come along on a mission to wipe out a group of aliens  whom have taken over a colony. After refusals and nightmares, she decides  to come along. After the landing and a disastrous and horrifying assault on  a colony building which leaves most of the soldiers dead, the remaing  soldiers retreat back to the ship. The crew decides to nuke the planet and  must get off. Unbeknowst to the crew, there are adult aliens aboard, not to  mention a few babies which the company is trying to smuggle back to Earth  to use as a military weapon. It is a chilling game of cat-and-mouse aboard  the ship with the aliens hunting down the humans including several  crowd-pleasing scenes of rapid-fire action. After a last, Ripley, Hudson,  and the little girl Newt are the only ones alive on the ship. After the  android Bishop fixes the main starship, Ripley, Hudson and Newt are ready  to go, except that Newt gets caught by the queen alien. Newt gets rescued,  and after they are safely off the planet, they discover the queen alien is  aboard, and it kills Bishop and Hudson. It all comes down to a hair-raising  climax featuring a spectacular batler between Ripley and the queen. James  Horner delivers an ominous score, and the visual effects are amazing. 7  impressive Academy Award nominations, including Weaver as Best Actress,  Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score. Winner for  Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects over films such as Top Gun, Little  Shop of Horrors, Star Trek 4:The Voyage Home, and Poltergeist 2: The Other  Side. Marred only by overlength and too much darkness. Overall, a classic  horror/ science fiction film. 4 1/2 stars!
6304789424|3.0|A pretty good sequel of the sequel but now its starting to get a little  repetitive.  I love the Alien set and this one is ok i can sit through this  one no problem the reason i bought it was to complete the set.  Follows  more of Alien then Aliens but can't live up to Alien 1 &amp; 2's standards.   Graphics are great you get to see more off the alien and more of it's  destruction but making it take place in a prison was a little far out but  ow well still good.  Only buy it if you want to complete the set.
B00001OH1S|2.0|The whole problem with the Soundtrack is that the &quot;nice&quot; stuff,  the stuff that made the movie feel &quot;ritzy&quot; and glamourous, the  jazz and the piano, the Sting soundtrack and the rest of the stuff is here.  But the music that rounded out the whole movie itself, such as the song  from the lovemaking scene between Russo and Brosnson, is NOT here. The  music from the original heist is not here. Hell, half the music from the  whole thing isn't here. Which makes this, while a nice CD to listen to, NOT  what I'd even want to buy. I listened to it, I returned it to the rack, and  I walked out. I wouldn't buy it, and MGM better start figuring out the  amount of space that a CD actually has, and what is DECENT music to listen  to, and what is not.<br />Welcome to the digital world, RIAA.
6301773551|5.0|What a movie it was amazing.  I thought George Lucas did an outstanding  job directing it.  When i first saw it  I couldn't believe this was made in  1977, the special effects were incredible.  They changed the way movies  were made forever.  This movie allowed the movie Alien to be made because  before they had no knowledge of how to make the Alien but Star Wars: A New  Hope made it happen.  The characters were well played from Uncle Owen to  Darth Vader to Obi Wan Kenobi, to bad Sir Alec Guiness died a few days ago.   Some people say i was slow but what do they know, it was extremely  interesting learning about Luke, Leia and Han.  I find it odd though that  Tatooine was a place nobody went to or knew about (except smugglers of  course) but some how Luke and Friends always end up there.  The begining  scene with the Imperial Class Star Destroyer shoting at the Corellion  Corvete was amazing it was a great opener to show the people what Star Wars  is all about.  So if you ever are in the need to watch a great movie put  this one on you shall not be dissappointed.  May The Force Be With You!!
B00000JCB2|4.0|The boys from Limp Bizkit come out guns a blazin' with their recent  release entitled &quot;Signifigant Other.&quot;  The album is saturated  with testosterone-fueled aggression spewed by Bizkit leadman Fred Durst  that will make you scream for more.  Durst masterfully tells tales of anger  with each passing lyric.  Be sure to listen to this album when you are  looking to unleash some anger.  Tracks such as &quot;Break Stuff&quot; and  &quot;I'm Broke,&quot; will pump up your adrenaline to freakish levels.   Furthermore, Dursts'rhyming skills are seen on the two best songs the album  has to offer.  The songs &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;N 2 gether Now&quot;  are classic Durst displaying his rich talents for rapping to a heavy beat.  Overall, &quot;Signifigant Other&quot; is an album true to the unique style  of Limp Bizkit.  It puts the band on the map as a force to be reckoned with  their funky fresh style of rap and rock .  This album is definetly a  must-buy!

B00003CX59|5.0|Ok, I truly loved this movie. It's so excellent, right down to the very  last detail. Except for one thing.. why is it that if the main character is  paired with a child, the child is never given much credit? The child I'm  refering to is Young Masbeth, and he is played by Marc Pickering. He,  ladies and gentlemen, is the #1 reason I wanted to see this movie in the  first place. He is given very little credit (at least I think so), even  though he was in some of the most important scenes in the movie. The  backgrounds, excellent. Casting, excellent. Plot, excellent. This *is* a  masterpeice (dangit, I don't know if I spelled that right or not). Marc  Pickering, if your out there, keep up the good work!! ( :) The reason I  adore him so much is, you guessed it, I'm in my early teens. So is he.  ::sighs::) The special affects in this movie are great, and Ray Park was  very gracefully as the Headless Horsemen. If a follow-up/sequel to this  movie is possible, I'd love to see the continueing adventures of our heros.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Released 99, but before it got popular in Poland, it was already 2000, so I'd name it the best album of the year 2000. Not an accidential mixture of  moods and sounds, but well composed piece of music. Very 'tasty', so that  you can almost smell it!.. with a great distinct, audible vocal by Richard  Patrick. &quot;Title of record&quot; seems to be pointed directly onto our  senses. A true nirvana...
B000002W9Q|4.0|No, there's not much of it, but there sure is a lot of dancing!:) Okay, I was only 7yrs old when this movie was released, and saw it for the first  time when I was ten. This is the movie that instilled the love for 60's  classics in my blood, and infected me with an incurable urge to dance. As  far as accuracy goes, there are some songs from the 80's thrown in there,  that kinda ruins the whole effect and throws the time frame outta whack,  but I guess they added the newer songs to the soundtrack to appeal to a  wider audience, and as far as that goes, it's payed off.<br />Yep, the movie  may not be all that glammo, but the music, well...the music in this case  makes the movie.
0767903854|5.0|Hilarious, laugh-out-loud descriptions of life in Australia.If you have  ever wanted to visit &quot;OZ&quot;(as it's know there),this will give you  an in-depth, yet immensely enjoyable overview. Having just returned from  living in Australia for four years, I must commend Bill Bryson for his  excellent portrayal of the &quot;Aussie&quot; existence. How could he be SO  perceptive in a few short visits?<br />My question is....Why change the Title  for the USA market? The rest of the world knows this book as &quot;Bill  Bryson Down Under&quot;.
B000009O8A|1.0|Forget Plan Nine,forget every movie you ever heard was the worst ever.This is it.A sick and depraved exercise in rape and revenge.Thats it, a woman  gets raped and gets her revenge.No character developement neccessary.Just a  girl and 3 rapists.The movies brutal depiction of the plot is ultra  realistic,almost in a supposed snuff film way.I do'nt know who's idea of  entertainment this would be,but it's not even worth it for those who live  where the thing was banned.No one should watch this it's just sick. The one  good thing about this is it's an excellent reason to buy a DVD player.If  any company would waste time releasing this on DVD then the floodgates must  be opening and everything you can think of will be coming soon.
B000006OS2|2.0|Couldn't wait to get this movie.  We bought it on DVD thinking it would be  of higher quality.  WRONG!  This movie is so poorly transfered it made me  mad just to watch it. It needs to be offered in letterbox, sometimes all  you see is the back of someones head and the person who is talking isn't  even on the screen.  Then the brightness goes up and down, and the picture  gets fuzzy.  If I had released this copy to the public I would be thourghly  embarressed.  I feel cheated out of my money and the fun of watching this  movie. If another version is offered with letterbox and MUCH better  quaility, I would buy it and throw this version in the trash. It has set a  new standard in our house, rent the DVD first and check the quality, then  buy.
0767802659|5.0|&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is an amazing DVD.  The special effects are astounding &amp; the bonus features are great.

0312853238|5.0|This book seems to draw young readers along like a spaceborne Harry  Potter. Judging by the glowing reviews this is the best book these readers  have come across in a long time. OSC has a great track record and has  interesting views on sci-fi such as his thoughts on how religion can  coexist with science fiction. That's beside the point here; this is a fine  tale about a child growing up under the weight of leadership duties and  decision making. OSC shows people and their problems are still the crux of  future story telling and the future is not exclusively devoted to  spaceships and aliens. The spare detail fit well, except in a few  instances, and the main character's inner tormoils were apt. I was not  riveted to the story as much as most readers (too far removed from  adolescence, I suppose, and the idea of six year olds doing this is a  stretch no matter how hopped their DNA is) though if I were their age I  likely would have been. As for those who call this &quot;the best book  ever,&quot; keep reading - you'll find other stories just as good as this  one.
0671034065|5.0|I have read everything Linda Howard and this is the best ever!! It's  funny, sexy and a little sad. But you won't want it to end.
0767903854|5.0|After 3 years in Australia I recently moved to the United States. That's why I really enjoyed this great book. He wrote about all the places I  visited - it made me feel like being home in Australia again. I also learnt  a lot of stuff I haven't heard about before.  It is probably hard for  someone to appreciate this book who hasn't lived down-under. But if you  did, go and buy it. You will just love it.  There is only one thing which I  don't understand: sometimes the author makes sexual references which are so  untypical American. It doesn't spoil the fun reading this book, it's just  something I noticed.
B000031XCR|5.0|Beautiful songs. Old and new songs alike, they sound so much better than  anything the newcomers have put together recently.<br />Some people say that  Celine will be upstaged by a new upstart but having listened to that  upstart's record, i don't think so.<br />Vocally, Celine holds her own and her  reneditions of classic songs like &quot;All The Way&quot; and &quot;The  First Time Ever&quot; are terrific, not the best. Not the worst  either!<br />Still i wish there were more songs from her Unison album (on this  record, there are none of them)<br />What happened to &quot;Where Does My  Heart Beat Now&quot;? And for goodness sake, Sony release that video  already! Whitney and Mariah Carey have their home video releases, so where  is Celine's?<br />Also what happened to unreleased material like &quot;Listen  to me&quot;, &quot;Voices That Care&quot;, &quot;Wishful  Thinking&quot;?<br />Still the new songs make up for this huge void.<br />If you  want to know how to seperate the good ones from the pseudo-good ones, play  this CD after listening to you-know-who-they-are...you'll hear the  difference and you'll know why Celine will still keep her title as reigning  pop diva after all.<br />So long, pretenders...let's just see who holds out  longer than the other.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I thought this album was fantastic, but be warned- if you don't like to  hear about some really graphic violence, don't buy it.  Keep your precious  ears away from the disturbing but all-too-realistic messages and themes  behind the songs in this CD.
0515127485|5.0|Compared to Fatherland and Enigma Archangel is much better. More action  and  faster paced. All I'm going to say is that it's about the Stalins. It  is worth reading.
6305075379|2.0|Prospective purchasers should note that this dvd is the dubbed version  where American actors replace the Australian actors on the soundtrack. I  understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie  was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at  the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have  thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version  and released that instead. Because of this irritating and pointless feature  of an otherwise fine movie (the best of the Mad Max series), I can only  rate the dvd 2 stars.
0684847817|5.0|I collect anything related to faeries, and this book is a true treasure.   It is full of enchanting art that captivated me immediately.  I highly  recommend it to anyone who collects fairies, enjoys fantasy artwork, or  just art lovers in general!
0790720434|5.0|After watching the 1987 version, I was very disappointed with the acting and decided to definitely watch the 1993 production.  The acting is  superior and the setting more realistic.  If someone could take the best  qualities of both movies and put them into one, to me that would be the  perfect Secret Garden movie.<br /><br />The 1987 version taught lessons more  easily to younger children, while this newer one will be enjoyed more by  older children and adults.  Colin's father (played by John Lynch) is a much  more human portrayal.  We can truly empathize with his sorrow and Colin's  need to have his father in his life.<br /><br />Mary Lenox was also played in a  more serious light by Kate Maberley.  She portrayed her character extremely  well.  Her story begins in India and we learn she is emotionally neglected,  yet spoiled and physically well taken care of.  She loses her parents in a  massive earthquake. (In the 1987 film it is a plague.)<br /><br />Since she can no  longer stay in India, she is literally shipped off to her uncle.  As she  enters the monstrosity of a castle, we feel she is doomed to be neglected, hated and locked away.  Even Mrs. Medlock (the housekeeper played by Maggie  Smith) is not impressed or sympathetic. Mary is told \\"not to go  wandering and poking about.\\" Mary's natural curiosity compels her to  discover a way out of her room and soon she finds secret doors, staircases, rooms and gardens.<br /><br />At first Martha (a maid) is her only friend, then she  soon learns to like Martha's brother Dikon. He shares her love of  gardening. Martha and Dikon seem to be the only truly happy characters for  the entire first half of the movie. All the actors have wonderful accents  and reveal the positive and negative aspects of each character.<br /><br />When Mary  meets Colin, she has in fact met her match. He is her cousin who is  bedridden, spoiled and annoying! His hysterical screeching makes him most  unlovable. Mary shows Colin that nothing is impossible when you put your  mind to it. She also says something profoundly beautiful at the end of the  story.<br /><br />I found the magic spell casting in this version a bit intense in  comparison to the 1987 version, where dancing around the fire was a fun  time. There is something about the 1987 version which I think appeals more to children, as the characters seem to have a bit more fun overall. This  1993 version has a much better ending. I recommend this version for those  who want a high-quality movie, and the 1987 version for those who can  overlook the acting. I think there is something to be learned from both  movies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewd to it. She also says something profoundly beautiful at the end of the  story.

079213690X|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best movies of the '90s  and one of my personal favorites.  The movie itself is excellent while the  amazing score by James Horner only adds to this picture.  The normal viewer  will get a great amount of enjoyment out of this picture.  However, there  are some rather large historical inaccuracies that provide the basis for  the whole movie.  If you are familiar with William Wallace, these will  slightly take away from the movie.  Otherwise, it is an excellent piece of  american cinema not to be missed.
0451191153|4.0|I really like this book. I may not agree with all of the ideals described  within its pages, but as far as keeping me interested, it is one of the  most challenging, yet eloquent books I've ever read.<br />I feel, though, as  if I missed a lot of what the author was trying to say. I felt as though  she repeated herself with slots of continuous dialogue that made me feel as  if I should fall to the ground and cry &quot;OK! I submit!&quot; But,  perhaps I missed something.<br />I love all the characters except for  Dominique. I wasn't quite sure of her motives and actions. She talked a lot  about how she wanted to suffer, but she didn't really suffer. Trying to  ruin Roark made her happy, and being with Roark made her happy. She had a  happy second marriage, but broke it off and tried to &quot;sacrifice&quot;  herself for other reasons. Her actions would seem only to hurt somone else,  and barely give her a scratch. But, on the other hand, she was, I suppose,  living like a true egotist. But, then again, she was only happy through a  few other people. I don't know. I'm just confused.<br />Ellsworth Toohey was  my favorite. They way he manipulated people was often funny and frightening  at the same time. The fact that he always &quot;had a sense of humor&quot;  showed how easy it was for him to needle into anyone's life.<br />All in all,  I think the book is worth reading again. I still feel as though I don't  have a grasp on everything, just maybe a jist. I think I was trying too  hard when I read this. I don't know, perhaps I'm one of those people who  would have found &quot;The Gallant Gallstone&quot; a good book.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is the best movie ever made.  I can't wait for the DVD of all three of them.  This movie is almost completely aloof from criticism.  When  people do speak badly of it, the say it glorifies violence and organized  crime.  This is not true.  It really shows the bad side of organized crime.   In the end, Michael Corleone faces many losses because of organized crime.   His wife leaves him, his daughter is killed, he orders the killing of his  brother and brother in law, his nephews are left fatherless because of him.   In the end, he dies all alone by himself.  He has lost everyone and  everything he ever really cared about.  So instead of a saga glorifying  violence and the mafia, it is really a tragedy showing the ill effects of  the mafia.
B000002KHH|5.0|I first listened to this album in 1980 because I was not a huge Sabbath  fan when this came out and even before. I listened to I believe it was  Paranoid and I was amazed. Paranoid, the title track is one of the best  Sabbath songs ever done and I love it more everytime I hear it! The entire  album is full of great songs that really show you just how good Black  Sabbath really are. Starting with the opening track, War Pigs, it presents  an awesome guitar solo and the drums in this song are just unbelieveable! I  will tell you this with no lies. War Pigs is my favorite song of all time!  Iron Man is a great work of power and it tells a story at the same time.  Electric Funeral is a good song that will stick in your mind for a good  while. Hell, all I do is hum these songs. Hand Of Doom and Rat Salad are  good songs as well. Then the last song on the album, Fairies Wear Boots.  This song is a good one as well. I think its funny too when Ozzy sings  about seeing Fairies dancing wearing boots. The only one that is a little  disappointing is Planet Caravan. It is decent but you can't understand what  he is singing. But it is mysterious at the same time. I actually like this  song a bit. Its not a heavy metal song but a slow rock type song. I can  picture Planet Caravan being played in a lounge or being used as elevator  music. Just the way it is. This album is Sabbath's best in my opinion and  will stay their best for all time. Rock on Sabbath...with Ozzy. We all know  those were their best years!
B0000025KI|5.0|Despite the runaway success of Born In The USA, and maybe because of it,  The River will always remain my favorite Springsteen album of the 1980's.  I was a frighteningly green college freshman when this album arrived on the  scene, and I can still recall vividly the first time I heard &quot;Hungry  Heart&quot; on the radio.  I have since heard the song called the  &quot;slightest&quot; song on his greatest hits album, but to this day that  opening drum salvo sends a chill through me.  It may not be his best song  ever, but anything capable of eliciting a reaction like that has to have  something going for it.  I have worn out countless cassette copies of this  album over the years, but when the mood strikes me to listen to it, it  still sounds fresh, most likely because it was never beaten to death on the  radio the way BITUSA was.  Springsteen really mixed it up on this album,  combining some of his best all-out rockers (Sherry Darling, Cadillac Ranch,  I'm A Rocker and Ramrod) with several equally amazing ballads (Independence  Day, The River and the haunting Point Blank.)  For my money, you can't go  wrong with any of Bruce's output from Greetings to Tunnel Of Love, but Born  To Run and The River make great places to start.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I bought this album just a few days ago and everytime I listen to it I  love it even more. Their style of metal has not changed at all since their  previous albums and Bruce's voice is as good as ever. I am more of a Bruce  Dickinson Iron Maiden fan than any other. My favorites are the opening  track, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Ghost  Of The Navigator&quot;, and well, all of them! I love every song on this  album! I hope their next album, if they make one, will be as good as this  one is. I encourage any Maiden fan to buy this album and experience Maiden  at their best!
B00004STDN|5.0|Buy it for the sound.  There are few movies with a better soundtrack and  soundfield.  The first 10 minutes are great movie-making but almost  unbearable to watch.  Visually, there are a lot of breath-taking mountain  scenes and the midair plane-to-plane scene is a standout on the DVD.  I'd  seen the movie at the theatre when it came out and later on VHS but the DVD  version on a big screen with a good sound system is like a new movie.  It's  full of wild special effects, fantastic sound and a 5-star popcorn muching  edge-of-your seat E-tictet ride!!

B00004U8JV|1.0|OK, is it just me that can't understand WHY Universal released a DTS version, Widescreen, obviously for filmphiles, that includes almost NONE of the extras found in the Widescreen Collectors version that doesn't offer  DTS (best audio option is Dolby 5.1 on the version with all the  goodies)?<br />This is true of BOTH Jurassic Park and  Lost World.....  <br />This is right up there with releasing a DVD with  limited Extra Features that is supposed to be a Collectors Edition and then  releasing another with more Extras a short time later!  What is the deal  with the studios?
B00004SCX6|5.0|I can't believe it! She had done it again for the second time in a row,entering at #1 on the US Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart, breaking over  1.3 million units,setting the record for the highest first week sales by a  female artist,being ever the first female artist also in Billboard music  history to break the million mark for the past 45 years.this week  12082000,she still stands at #2 on the album chart,grossing over 4.5  million sales in total in just 11 mere weeks. Well about the album  itself,it's a mixture of pop,rock,soul, country,and R&amp;B,almost the  mixture of everything,it's the right album for practically everyone! Songs  that i will recommended beside the theme song &quot;Oops...I Did It  Again&quot;,I will think that the song &quot;Lucky&quot;,&quot;What U See  Is (What U Get)&quot;,&quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot;,will make some  great numbers,the ballard &quot;Where Are You Now?&quot; makes the album  complete and perfect! Great songs,Great songwriters,Great producer,and  Great artist,i don't see the reason why you should left this album out in  your cd collection
0316777722|4.0|Anyone who read Naked would be wise to read this latest collection--Me  Talk Pretty One Day is a suitable encore to Sedaris' previous book; it is  full of residual laughter that may feel like it comes more from one's  familiarity with his world view than these actual pages but is hilarious  nonetheless.  MTP1D doesn't hang together the way the brilliant Naked did  but it's well worth the purchase (especially at this price) because it will  have you quivering with laughter, countless times.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|BEAUTY AND THE BEAST opened my mind to the world of film. It is a treasure for the eyes as well as the mind,an intelligent, transcendent movie that  features an timeless love story between two very likeable people,and the  ones who care about them. These people are complex,a true rarity in  animated films(and most live-action movies.) There is also an element of  eroticism in this film,a chemistry more sexual than any live actors could  ever  portray.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is one of the greatest films  ever made.
B000002HGD|3.0|Well, I have to respect Moby for being brave enough to include a vast  range of music, from thrash (&quot;What Love&quot;) to ambient (&quot;God  Moving Over The Face of The Waters&quot;). However, I still feel he tried  so hard to make a diverse album he forgot to make a coherent one. There are  some wonderful moments on the disc, namely &quot;Hymn&quot;, &quot;Feeling  So Real&quot;, and &quot;Anthem&quot;, which almost are worth the price of  admission alone. Then again, there are tracks like &quot;What Love&quot;  and &quot;When It's Cold I'd Like To Die&quot; that would be better left  off the album. The biggest flaw, though, is that the album has some  incredibly jarring transitions. It reinforces the impression that this is a  collection of songs (and an uneven one) rather than an album.<br />Overall,  &quot;Everything Is Wrong&quot; is not a bad album, but it's certainly not  the best piece in Moby's catalog. I would recommend picking up  &quot;Play&quot; and his 1991 self-titled album first, and then consider  this one if you really liked those two.
B000003S0Z|5.0|From the avant-garde rock of &quot;No One Receiving&quot; to the soft,  hymn-like &quot;Spider and I&quot;, this is one fine album that I listen to  often (start to finish without skipping). There are only two instrumentals  on here (&quot;Energy Fools the Magician&quot; and &quot;Through Hollow  Lands&quot;...&quot;Energy Fools the Magician&quot; being the better one)  and the vocal tracks make you realize the power and structure of Brian  Eno's songwriting. &quot;Backwater&quot; is a fun song that features the  piano...similar to &quot;St. Elmo's Fire&quot; and &quot;I'll Come  Running&quot; from Another Green World. Songs 1-5 are mostly energetic, and  6-10 are softer. The softer songs are the most enjoyable ones. &quot;Julie  With&quot;, &quot;By This River&quot; and &quot;No One Receiving&quot; are  my favorites on here. The keyboard parts in &quot;Julie With&quot; and  &quot;By This River are really touching and beautiful. Before and After  Science is very essential if you enjoyed Another Green World. Although it's  not as good, it will make you appreciate Eno's music even more.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauren Hill has alwayse been an amazing artist between her voice and her  gift of expressing herself in a musical way, from the fugees to solo,  Lauren has swept this country off its feet... no matter what she sings, her  songs alwayse bury themselves into the souls of others, &quot;forgive them  father&quot; is one of my favorite songs, not because it has a great beat  or because of the vocals in it, I love that song because of the meaning  behind it, because of the words and how I can relate them to my life or  experiances, thats is one of the reasons Lauren is such a great artist,  because all of her songs are down to earth so we can relate to them.
B000005IU2|5.0|Funhouse is my favorite album by The Stooges. I listen to it soo much.  &quot;TV Eye&quot; and &quot;Dirt&quot; are my two favorite Stooges songs  (&quot;Dirt&quot; especially). This music has touched me in a way that no  other music by Iggy Pop has. I can't tell you how much you need this album.  If you don't own it, go buy it and have fun :)
B000002UAC|4.0|This, the second Beatles studio album, was recorded on a single day in June, 1963.  The boys were playing their regular instruments: Ringo on drums, Paul on bass, John on rhythm guitar, and George on lead guitar.  So  it's all Beatles, and it's all band.  It must have seemed like one huge jam  session!  Recorded, as it was, before Beatlemania swept America, &quot;With  The Beatles&quot; finds the band trying to repeat the winning formula of  the previous album, &quot;Please Please Me.&quot;  It was customary in  those days, to release albums in Britain separate from singles.  So the  upcoming smash, &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand,&quot; is not on this album.  It, and both its flip-sides (&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; in the UK  and &quot;This Boy&quot; in the US) were added to nine tracks of &quot;With  The Beatles&quot; to create the American issue, &quot;Meet The  Beatles,&quot; which sold better than 5 million copies.  The five other  tracks from &quot;With The Beatles&quot; were issued in America on  &quot;The Beatles' Second Album.&quot; The group seems to be in two modes  here.  The 7 Lennon-McCartney numbers tend to be messages for their growing  number of female fans... Lesser versions (at least in spirit) of &quot;I  Want To Hold Your Hand.&quot;  The reason I rated this album only 4 stars  is because there is only so much, &quot;I'm Gonna See My Baby Tonight&quot;  that I can take in one setting.  &quot;It Won't Be Long,&quot; &quot;All  I've Got To Do,&quot; &quot;All My Loving,&quot; &quot;Little Child,&quot;  &quot;Hold Me Tight,&quot; &quot;Not A Second Time.&quot;  There is a  sameness of message there that makes the whole a bit stale, very quickly.  &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; isn't too far off, but it is interesting,  in that it was written for The Rolling Stones!  They needed one more song  to finish their album, Lennon and McCartney were guests at the session, and  they wrote the whole song during a break!  The one dissenting voice (as  would come to be usual) from all this &quot;Yeah, Yeah, Yeah&quot; love-man  talk belonged to George Harrison, singing one of his own compositions for  the first time on &quot;Don't Bother Me.&quot;  The other side of The  Beatles on this album is reflected in their choice of outside material.  &quot;Please Mister Postman&quot; shows the group paying homage to both the  &quot;Girl Group&quot; sound (as on the previous lp) and the Motown Sound,  which also gets the treament on &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;You've Really  Got A Hold On Me.&quot; &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; is from the Chuck  Berry catalogue, and is sung by George (he still uses it to close his  concerts).  &quot;Devil In Her Heart&quot; (also sung by George) was a  minor hit for a group called the Donays, while &quot;Till There Was  You&quot; was taken from the play, &quot;The Music Man.&quot;  All told,  this album showcases a very tight band that was waiting to see if the bank  would break.  It did.would come to be usual) from all this &quot;Yeah, Yeah, Yeah&quot; love-man  talk belonged to George Harrison, singing one of his own compositions for  the first time on &quot;Don't Bother Me.&quot;  The other side of The  Beatles on this album is reflected in their choice of outside material.   &quot;Please Mister Postman&quot; shows the group paying homage to both the  &quot;Girl Group&quot; sound (as on the previous lp) and the Motown Sound,  which also gets the treament on &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;You've Really  Got A Hold On Me.&quot; &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; is from the Chuck  Berry catalogue, and is sung by George (he still uses it to close his  concerts).  &quot;Devil In Her Heart&quot; (also sung by George) was a  minor hit for a group called the Donays, while &quot;Till There Was  You&quot; was taken from the play, &quot;The Music Man.&quot;  All told,  this album showcases a very tight band that was waiting to see if the bank  would break.

B000005IU1|5.0|I believe that Iggy Pop, the Asheton brothers, and Dave Alexander invented  punk rock with this album...The three chord songs and overtly immature  lyrics are two elements that are still found in punk rock today (more than  30 years after the release of this album). This has led me to believe that  this music is also timeless. I love everything on here and I can't pick a  favorite song. The sombre &quot;We Will Fall&quot; has got to be the most  obscure song I've ever heard Iggy sing, but it's a favorite of mine. The  anthemic &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; is one of the best songs on here.  If you're into old punk rock, this is a must. Very influential and highly  recommended to all...
0060977493|2.0|After completing this book on the third attempt I am left with mixed  feelings. Here is my honest opinion. This is STYLE over SUBSTANCE at  times...; Disjointed passages over story which is in the background if  there is one; this is good marketing hype scoring over serious analysis and  so on. Yet the book does have some evocative descriptions. SO in the end,  not the best you will read, yet not too bad either...
0380788624|4.0|I first read Snow Crash by Stephenson- a friend had been recommending it for six months, I had a gift certificate, and I decided &quot;Why  not?&quot;  I loved it.  So, last month, when I had a little extra money, I  noticed Cryptonomicon.  At first I was wary, but I'm a history freak, and I  gave in.  I have to say I was thrilled with it.  Stephenson does a great  job of mixing the stories of the past with the present.  He's got a great  way of taking little digressions off the main story, taking up a handful of  pages here, or a dozen pages there, that don't add to the story, but are so  interesting, that I was never once annoyed by the tangents.  My only  problem with the book would be Stephenson's technical explanations on  cryptology, but, other then that, this is an incredible novel and a great  kick-off to the series.
6305132984|4.0|Seldom will you see a movie that tries as hard as \\"West Side Story\\". Every scene jumps will color and motion and ostentatious evidence of an extraordinary meticulous pre-production. The studio obviously pulled out all stops to make an entertaining, Oscar-gathering movie. But this is also the movie's flaw (well, this and a largely bland leading couple): It looks like a late-50's, early 60's extravaganza, a perfectly oiled entertainment machine cleverly designed to obliterate any competition from television. It makes a spectacle of itself. This being said, it's a DVD to own because of the gorgeous colors, good songs and choreography, and imagination. I wish I'd seen it on the big screen. <br />Also, the politics of the film are pleasingly, suprisingly progressive, dealing with racism and prejudice, which is a brave thing for the notoriously squemish Hollywood. It's got a lot more meat on its bones than, say, \\"Bye, Bye Birdie\\", another movie from the period that's shallow and flashy compared to \\"West Side\\". <br />Incidentally, one of the co-directors is the smart Robert Wise, editor of \\"Citizen Kane\\" and director of the fine films \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" and \\"Star Trek: The Movie\\". They don't make them like him anymore.
0790731940|5.0|This movie is great because it is so funny, and both guys and girls will  like it.  If you're just hanging out with a bunch of people, and you need a  movie to watch...this is it.  It has everything you could want-comedy,  romance, and adventure.  All 3 lead characters play their roles perfectly;  they work well together.
1573225517|5.0|Rob Flemming, the guy from the book, loves his ex-wife. But he is a man,  and men love their albuns and comics (and anything that can be collected)  more them admit to love women. Men are just like children in a certain  point. If you're a man, you know what i'm talking - but probably desagree.  If you're a woman, you also know, and you hate men when they demonstrate  that they can love their comics pretty much more than they love you. So Rob  is just like me (and just like you, if you're a man). High Fidelity is  about a 30 year old man that is understanding how much fool he is. and he  loves rock. ok, you must read it.

B000002VMD|5.0|Ms. Whitney Houston simply bubbles over with pasion in her works on the  soundtrack to the suspenseful movie, &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. There is of  course her mega hits- &quot;I Will ALways Love You&quot;, &quot;Run&quot;,  and others. Her inspiring rendition of &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; goes back  to her gospel roots. Plus we are treated to an eclectic mix of songs by  variuos artists.<br />One of my favorite non-Houston tunes is, &quot;Even If  My Heart Would Break&quot; by Aaron Neville and Kenny G. Syrupy sweet and  lip-licking delicious.<br />Passionate, well mixed, &amp; arranged --  &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; is a safe bet for your collections.<br />other  musical suggestions: &quot;Pretty Woman-Soundtrack&quot; and &quot;Radio  Hits Vol. I &amp; II&quot; by Donna Summer<br />Thanks for your interest &amp;  comment votes--CDS
B0000214F2|5.0|This is a true story of a depressed man who chooses to rise above his own  needs and instead dedicate his life to helping others.  By doing so he  discovers true happiness.  Patch (Robin Williams) becomes a better,  stronger, and more joyful person through his understanding of  Compassion.<br />This movie can teach us so much if we will allow it.  If you  are sad or hurting please watch this movie!  Laughter is indeed the best  medicine! One of my favorite scenes is the gynecology convention that Patch  oversees--hiliarious!  But this movie to me will always be about Compassion  and the Power of our Spirit to Overcome Anything.<br />&quot;Patch Adams&quot;  has all the emotion a movie can hold.  I highly recommend this movie!  Let  it transform you into a butterfly too!  (Once you see the movie you will  understand what this means.)
B0000025DD|4.0|It was always Dave Gilmour's smoother than smooth voice and bluesy guitar  playing that attracted me to Floyd and both get a damn good thrashing on  this, his first solo album.<br />It's clear from the start just what an impact  Gilmour had on Floyd after the departure of Syd Barrett; most have the  Floyd as Water's baby after Barrett's departure, butthe songs presented  here could have been on any Floyd album from &quot;Meddle&quot; to  &quot;Animals&quot; and not be seen as the weaker siblings.<br />&quot;There's  No Way Out Of Here&quot; is a laid back classic delivered with the minimum  of fuss and overdubbing; Gilmour's voice rarely rising above a breath. All  the tracks here appear very personal and seem to be the songs Gilmour had  been wanting to right but had been frustrated by the claustrophobia of the  band environment.<br />It would be interesting to compare this album with post  Waters Floyd; aside from multi-tracked production and million dollar  mastering, the songwriting is basically the same... just add Bob Ezrin and  mix...<br />&quot;Short And Sweet&quot; reminds me of &quot;Sorrow&quot; fromn  &quot;Momentary Lapse...&quot; ands leads to the wonderful instrumental  &quot;Raise My Rent&quot;a track that could easily have been on  &quot;Division Bell&quot;.<br />The album is brought to a melancholic climax  with &quot;I Can't Breathe Anymore&quot;; a cry from Gilmour over the  change of direction the Floyd were about to undergo, possibly?<br />Surely the  strongest of all The Floyd members solo efforts, if you like  &quot;Meddle&quot;, &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; and that era Floyd,  you'll love this...
0876855575|5.0|Ham on Rye provides a beautifully written account on Charles Bukowski's  &quot;growing up&quot; experience. It is humourous, sad and at times  uplifting, leaving you feeling empathy with the main character - himself.   It is not a book you can put down easily because of this and I finished it  feeling somewhat dissapointed because I wanted to read more.
0812932293|4.0|For me the worst part of any autobiography is the first half a dozen  chapters where the subject tells of the hard times and the strict father  when most of us want to get to the parts we can relate to.This book does  not have too much time for that as Branson started his entrepeneur skills  at just sixteen setting up his own magazine. He takes us through the mail  order side of Virgin, the record shops the meteoric rise of the other  sectors and his ballooning exploits, and his infamous battles with British  Airways. What makes Branson different is there are no pretensions, he comes  across as lucky rather than overtly clever and astute as opposed to  brilliant minded.  he loves his wife and kids, yet is driven on to do more  and more (mad) projects.  The book is a story rather than a chronological  tale.  He has been arrested, fell out with friends, been ruthless even but  when you shut the book up at the end you don't feel bitter or resentful,  just that he is an ordinary nice bloke.
B000002HGD|3.0|'Every Thing Is Wrong' was the first album of the prolific Moby that I  purchased.  On the first hearing, I thought it was immature, poppy techno.   Subsequent hearings of the album did little to abate this inital feeling.   However, all that said, taken at face value, the recording is still an  enjoyable one.  Try not to think too hard about the music and it will take  you into a moody trance from which it is hard to break until the conclusion  of the final track.<br />The interlinking songlets of techno-punk-thrash are  undoubtably shocking, even on the 101st hearing of the album, and, for me,  detract from the album's trance-like feel.  <br />I may not read between the  lines on this one as much as I should, but taken at face value, it is still  an enjoyable album.
0792838084|5.0|That's \\"Blue Velvet\\" she's singing, and that's blue velvet he's got in his  mouth.<br />Dennis Hopper combines pure evil with moral degeneracy in a style  not to be forgotten in this original shocker from David Lynch.  The  juxtaposition of the sleepy logging town with the depraved Hopper and his  sick crew really makes the evil stand out.  Laura Dern, playing a  fifties-style sweetheart, is likewise an apt foil for the compromised and  befouled Isabella Rossellini (Ingrid Bergman's daughter, lest we forget)  who plays a small town chanteuse with some very kinky sexual needs.  Kyle  MacLachlan stars as a Nancy Drew wanna-be who gets in a couple of fathoms  over his head.<br />The plot is as clever as the devil, surprising us at  several turns, yet at no time does it go beyond anything reasonable.  The  characters are vivid, memorable and entirely believable.  This is very  close to a great movie.  To nit-pick I'd have to say that the feel good  resolution could have used a touch of Tabasco, and I was a little annoyed  at being lead to believe that the father was a bad cop; in fact I have the  feeling that Lynch had another ending in mind but gave us the old style  Hollywood finale as a second thought.<br />Rossellini and her apartment-a  simple, but exquisitely designed set-will probably stay with me through the  next millennium.  Also indelible is Hopper sucking on oxygen or nitrous to  turbo himself up to do dirty deeds.  The bit from Dean Stockwell as the  clown-faced gay, lip syncing a Roy Orbison tune as we wait to see what he  and Hopper are going to do to MacLachlan, made my skin crawl.
B000002NJS|4.0|Not being your standard Madonna fan, I was slightly sceptical when I purchased this recording.  While I enjoyed both the releases of `Frozen'  and `Power of Goodbye', I knew relatively little about the other tracks on  this album, and unfortunately, 2 tracks do not maketh a good  album.<br />Fortunately, my worrying was entirely unwarranted; the album is  cram packed full of beautiful melodies, moving lyrics and epic songs, and  even for the non-Madonna fan, there is enough here to make you pleased you  laid the money down.<br />This is the first thing that Madonna has produced  for a long time, and with the new baby comes yet another new image.   Madonna seems to be rivalled only by Kylie Minogue in the competition with  regards the sheer number of image changes possible in one lifetime.  She  has hooked up with William Orbit in an unlikely partnership that works very  well in Madonna's favour.  The new style of music borders on tries to be  many things, electro being one of them, and poetry the other.  Madonna is  the queen of pop and as such neither of these attempts at something higher  are completely successful, and at best, Ray of Light is a light pop-electro  effort.  But it is better for this.<br />The lyrics are something to be  marvelled at and this is surely on of the greatest attempts at philosophy  that pop has ever witnessed.  `Nothing Really Matters' and `Sky Fits  Heaven', perhaps being the best examples of this.  The lyrics in `Power of  Goodbye', `Frozen', and `Skin' are perhaps less in the line of poetic  Madonna, but are no less beautiful.  These three tracks also boast, in my  opinion, the most striking tunes.<br />Overall this is an outstanding album.   It does try to be a little more than it actually succeeds in being, but for  all this it is a masterpiece in memorable, haunting melodies and lyrics  that stay in your head for hours.<br />When you start quoting Madonna to your  peers, just stop and think: it's a safe bet that you never imaginedyourself doing this.

B00004U30D|4.0|The general population seems to be split on whether they loved or hated this movie.  All, however, will be forever haunted by it.<br />I doubt that  there is a person alive who could not relate to at least one of the  beautifully crafted characters, which included everything from a  success-driven consumer wife, to a helpless man on the brink of an  awakening, to a constant observer who finds himself burdened by the  splendid beauty of the world.  This film is so simple due to its portrayal  of seemingly ordinary life, yet so involved at the same time due to the  fact that nothing is as it seems.  In this way, the film creates a metaphor  for life itself, which seems to be quite plain and simple, yet is anything  but.  There are no ordinary things, nor are there ordinary people, and when  a person looks closer, they will find that there is beauty in everything.   This message is one that will stay with the viewer, despite their opinion  of the film.
B000000WCA|1.0|I hate the Spice Girls, plain and simple.  They are just a T&amp;A version of Menudo, New Edition and New Kids on the Block.  They are just a put  together package to prove that females can be thrown together harmoniously.  Not this pack. These women couldn't carry a tune in a pick up truck and  their overly simplistic songs are dismally disappointing.  BOO!  HISS!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Like 1996's Primal Fear, Fight Club is a film that must be watched repeatedly in order to fully comprehend its cinematic brilliance.  Clues  that lead the viewer to the plot twist near the end of the film can be seen  throughout the movie, which makes it necessary to see this movie more than  once.  Perhaps my opinion is biased due to my respect for Edward Norton as  a talented actor, however, Norton did not have to carry this film by  himself.  Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meatloaf, Jared Leto and a slew  of other supporting actors helped make this film the convincing tale that  it is.  What is so convincing about it, however, is that we can all somehow  relate to Edward Norton's character, who finds himself trapped in the  machinery of modern life.  He accepts his worker-consumer status because,  after all, people like him are the ones who make the world go round.  Soon  he finds himself grasping for help deep within himself when he finds that  others can not give him the support that he needs.  This is when he meets  Tyler Durden, who turns his life into a game of breaking out of his  zombie-like state of living.  The most significant arguments of the film  come from Tyler's philosophies on life and how one should avoid being  ordinary.  This was a great film, with original ideas and frightening  points about the lives which we all find ourselves living.
0684865130|5.0|A brief exploration of plot and character serves as an important and  integral segment of most book reviews. None of that is necessary when  speaking about Joseph Heller's masterpiece, Catch-22. Every year, in high  schools throughout America, a rather large percentage of english teachers  introduce this novel to yet another class of high school english students.  What a good thing it is that these teachers do.<br />Catch-22, from the  moment of its publication, redefined the anti-war novel. Witty, ironic,  savagely sarcastic, yet all the time retaining the poignancy of truth, this  book has played a substantial role in teaching people to question  authority.<br />If you've read Catch-22 before, grab it off the bookshelf and  read it again. If you've been given this book as a class assignment, thank  your teacher and relish your good fortune.
630518299X|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater, I soon came to the realization that many of the viewers could not comprehend that Jim Carrey was starring  in a dramatic role.  They assumed that his innocence and happiness was the  common Jim Carrey-goofiness, and unfortunately they overlooked the most  brilliant aspect of Carrey's acting.  Truman Burbank was brought up in a  perfect world, and for this reason, Carrey portrays him as happy, yet not  quite satisfied with his life.  Every time Carrey smiles to his neighbors,  his friends, or his wife, you can see a true emptiness within his eyes that  only talented actors can produce.  The Truman Show also has a wonderful  supporting cast with the performances of Ed Harris, Laura Linney, and  Natascha Mcelhone.  My personal favorite was Laura Linney, who portrayed  the perky wife/obsessed actress whose job it was to live with a man whom  she couldn't stand, not to mention act as an advertiser for the show's  sponsors.  While the performances in the movie were superb, the plot  undoubtedly unveils the greatness of this film.  Packed full of  philosophical inquiry and the realization that no one can be sure of the  assumed truth around them, this film leaves the audience thinking about  their own worlds long after they have left the theater or shut off the VCR.   This kind of reaction to a movie does not happen often, and when it does,  it is clear that the film is a true original.
0812550706|5.0|I don't normally read science fiction, but Orson Scott Card is a master.  Even people who don't appreciate science fiction as a rule (like me), are  thrilled with this one. It's a sci-fi classic that has won numerous awards.  Although the setting is science fiction, the science fiction elements are  more a backdrop for Card's exploration of the human condition. A  suspenseful plot about kids and computer games, with an ironic twist at the  end completes the package that has spellbound thousands of  readers.<br />Contemporary fiction doesn't get much better than this. Highly  recommended!
0385486804|4.0|Krakauer's account is fascinating if not extremely disturbing.  The only  criticism I have is the author's discussion of his own wilderness  experiences which interrupt the flow of the book.  But even having said  that, this is a fabulous book.  This one will stay with you for a long  time.
076790382X|5.0|This book is the US edition of the book published elsewhere as &quot;Notes  from a Big Country&quot;.<br />Although the US edition has lost some of the  strengths of the original, it also retains most of its enjoyable content.  Bryson makes insightful and witty observations about American culture.  Based on his weekly newspaper columns for an English newspaper, Bryson  describes life in America.<br />Readers are guaranteed to laugh out loud, but  at the same time the humour delivers much food for thought about North  American culture. For North Americans who are perhaps guilty at times of  arrogance, such self-examination and a critical close look at ourselves is  of great benefit.<br />This is an entertaining as well as thought provoking  read.
0393307050|5.0|When I first picked up Master and Commander, I was skeptical.  I was not  particularly interested in the English navy circa 1800.  But it came  strongly recommended, so I plunged in - and I was hooked!  These are the  most complete and satisfying novels of friendship evolving over the course  of many years that a person could wish for.  I have come to feel a bond of  affection for the characters O'Brian has drawn that is unique in a lifetime  of reading.  Some time after finishing the series - and there are 20  volumes in what amounts to a running narrative - I returned to Master and  Commander to see how the experience would color my reading of it.  Now, I  am reading the series for the second time!<br />Come, read, enjoy!
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is perhaps the last occasion on which all four members of the  classic Pink Floyd line up were all contributing fully to an album.<br />The  album continues the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; themes of alienation  from and dissatisfaction with the modern world with its false  facades.<br />Roger Waters bleak views of the world are not to everyone's  taste but when they come with music this good, can you really  complain?<br />My favourite track here is &quot;Pigs (Three different  ones)&quot; mostly because all four band members are really getting into  the song. But, it is invidious to select a favourite track from an album  like this. First of all, everything here is of the highest quality but  secondly, this album is all of a piece and really needs to be seen in that  light.<br />For me, this album really does represent the very peak of Pink  Floyd's work. I cannot say that if you only have one Pink Floyd CD, it  should be this one because I know that if you only have one of their CDs,  it will be &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; but this should be at the top  of your shopping list.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I own this video on laser disc(s).  The movie follows the book (Killer Angels) very well.  The book (novel) is must reading for any history buff.   The DVD version of Gettysburg on one disc will improve viewing pleasure.   The movie itself is a well produced with excellent acting by a great cast.   The &quot;Making of Gettysburg&quot; is nearly as interesting as the movie  itself.  This movie is the best depiction of a historical event that I have  witnessed.
B00003W8NM|4.0|A daring film by Fincher, Pitt, and Norton.  The disappointing ending prevents it from getting 5 stars, but taking on this subject makes that  flaw forgivable.
B00004U9MS|4.0|Well, ever since &quot;Parachutes&quot; drifted into the British charts at  number 1# people have been very eager to declare them as saviours to indie  music. The album is indeed very good but at the same time I think this  praise might be somewhat misplaced. <br />While comparaisons to Radiohead and  Travis have been constant, Coldplay have neither the distinctiveness of a  Radiohead or that mellow charm of Travis. So don't jump on the bandwagon  yet because frankly Coldplay just aren't that good. <br />The success of  Parachutes lies in the success of &quot;Yellow&quot; the second single to  be taken from the album. Already I have heard people saying that this is  their &quot;Why Does it Always Rain on Me.&quot; To me &quot;Yellow&quot;  is not nearly good enough to be described as a signature tune. Sure, it is  a lovely, mid paced, very pleasant ballad. &quot;Shiver&quot;, the first  single is actually better, another lovely track which is typical of what  people seem to love about Coldplay: That is that this group sings about  life and love in a very unpretensious and friendly manner. If you want edge  Coldplay are definitley not for you.<br />Don't get me wrong,  &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a very good album. Colplay do indeed excell at  the cozy ballads like &quot;Spies&quot;. At the very least they will charm  you. All in all I wonder why this has got so much attention. There is  nothing on &quot;Parachutes&quot; to justify the claims that Coldplay are  the best new group in town. They are just another group that wears their  hearts on their sleeves and charm the masses. Travis started this trend and  it seems to be catching on.<br />A very good album, just not as good as people  say.
6305232660|5.0|First things first. If you want action, don't see this movie. Go rent  Armageddon with it's static characters and predictable plot.<br />To tell the  truth this is the most moving disastor movie I've ever seen. It seems every  charachter gives a powerhouse performance. This was a relief after watching  the charachters in Armageddon make jokes just when Earth was supposed to be  destroyed. The cast includes the ever-great Morgan Freeman, superb Robert  Duvall, newcomer Tea Leoni, and screen favorite Vanessa Redgrave. A lot of  movies try too crowd too many good actors into a story line, with awful  results. Somehow this one works. All the characters are believable. And you  care about them. Morgan Freeman is painful to watch at times, he performs  so well.<br />People die in this movie. But you feel though through their  sacrifice, hope will prevail. It different from Armaggedon. I felt that  they killed charachters off in that movie to either keep the plot going, or  because they had already served their purpose. Deep Impact is more  realistic though, I gurantee that by the time it's over, there won't be a  dry eye in the house.
079213690X|5.0|The first time I started to watch this exquisite video, I had to stop the  video and regroup.  Scenes and acting were so poignant, that it struck too  close to my senses.  The second time I attempted to watch this instant  classic, could only be tried after watching &quot;Back to School,&quot;  with Rodney Danagerfield.  Got through the first few battle scenes that  were, as stated in the film, conclusive that the Scotts fought like  &quot;warrior poets.&quot;  After having spent 24 years in the military, I  still don't know how I would handle such close order combat as was depicted  in this epic.  Fortunately, some good news fell upon me one day, and I was  actually able to watch the entire film all the way through, and yes, this  infantry &quot;grunt&quot; welled up with tears.  Gratification that I had  come this far with severe and chronic PTSD was a milestone in my personal  &quot;therapy.&quot;  See this one folks, but be prepared for the  experience of a lifetime in moviedom.  As lengthy as the film is, time is  never a consideration, but I would have enjoyed watching the Scotts  ultimately win their independance in the final battle.  This one heads my  collection.

B00000IPAX|4.0|Many people seem to think that Blink 182 has sold out, just because they  are on MTV and their sound has MATURED since the Dude Ranch days.  This CD  purely expresses the musical and lyrical talent that the band really has.   But, by the way, THIS IS NOT PUNK.  Punk is bands like NOFX, The Clash, and  Pennywise.  This is pop-punk, which is still good in its own aspect, but  don't call it punk.  The only REAL punk songs are &quot;Aliens Exist&quot;  and &quot;The Party Song&quot;.  These guys can go from writing a  completely stupid (but good) song such as &quot;Dysentery Gary&quot;, to  writing an EXCELLENT anti-suicide song which really shows their musical  depth in &quot;Adam's Song&quot;.  The best song on this CD has to be  &quot;Going Away To College&quot;, which has the perfect blend of lyrics  and music.  Drummer Travis Barker has to be the best drummer in his class,  with major solos on &quot;Going Away To College&quot; and  &quot;Anthem&quot;.  This is a good place to start for newer fans of Blink  182.
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day has a lot of good things gotng for them on this album.  But i'm  tired right now so i'm not gonna name them off.  If you like happy punk  music about smokin' dope, then this is for you.
B00003CXGG|3.0|I'm going to start out by saying that for the most part I did enjoy this movie.  There is entertainment here, and a fair part of the movie moves  along pretty good, but you feel as you watch it that it could be better.  And one way it could have been better, at least in my opinion, would have  been to have had more of Jet Li and Aaliyah in the movie.  A movie that has  a title Romeo Must Die, even though that's not Li's name in the movie,  still should have more of the stars in it.  It's when the two of them are  together that we get the best scenes in the movie.<br />The two main  characters never actually generate a love interest, too much else is going  on for that to happen, but they are interesting in the way they interact  with one another.  Two of my favorite scenes are the ones where Han(Li)  used Trish(Aaliyah) as a weapon to battle a woman because he won't hit her  himself, and the one where he gets talked into playing football with some  of Trish's fathers henchmen.<br />The main problem of the movie is that it  gets bogged down when Han and Trish aren't in it.  That's not to say that  some of the other actors don't do a fair job in their roles, but the plot  doesn't really support them.  The plot seems to swim in and out of focus a  lot, leaving you confused by exactly who's doing what and why.<br />I have to  finish by stating that I haven't seen that many of Li's movies yet.  Before  this one the only other one I had seen was The Black Mask.  Just by  watching these two movies, I can tell Li can fight, and want to see more of  him.  I just wish they had let him open up a little more in this movie.  There were some decent fight scenes, one of the better ones in my book  being the one where he is strung up by one leg while fighting, but I was  still wishing for more.  Maybe next time.
0375501851|1.0|I always complete a book, ALWAYS.  Not this one it's still on my table  beside the sofa collecting dust. I tried to get to know the characters, I  tried to get into the story...that's just it, I had to try very hard to  like this book. One day I just put it down and never went back.
B000007T1M|5.0|I love this record... However, as the mooks say they have never heard  anything that sounded like this before, I would like to turn on those who  may not be familiar with the Alternative Tenticles label  to  check out  both the Dead Kennedys and NoMeansNo (especially the WRONG album, from '89)  which System very much brings to mind.<br />That said, SYSTEM OF A DOWN turned  my head around, and I cannot stop listening to it!
0316152196|5.0|This is a great murder mystery. Connelly is great at keeping the reader  off balance. The characters were rich and the story line was compelling.  This was my first Bosch novel so I can't comment on the change of Bosch's  personality from past books but if you take that out of the equation this  book is a great read. I can't wait to read through his other works.
B00003CWTI|5.0|People who watch 'Magnolia' seem to be seperated into two catagories.  A: They watch it, and they fall in love with it or B: They watch it, and say  &quot;This is confusing, boring, vulgar, long, pointless, long, and long'.   So what does this prove?  That 'Magnolia' is a masterpiece and that whoever  doesn't like it just doesn't 'get it'?  Or maybe Magnolia fans, while  adament, are a little misguided and a little too awe-struck with a just-ok  movie?  Nope to both.  It just proves that 'Magnolia' isn't for everyone,  and if Jimmy Gator can be forgiven, so can non-fans. As you can tell by my  rating, I am in the 'A' catagory.  I was instantly taken by the multiple  characters, original storylines, and breakneck opening sequence.   All I  ask is for people to try it out, because it packs a great message with some  wonderful cinematography and acting.
0451160916|5.0|I'd just like to preface my remarks by saying that, unlike the majority of the reviewers, I am not really a Stephen King fan, or even a fan of horror  (in fact, I hate it).  Honestly, though, The Shining is not a horror story-  it's a psychological thriller, and an insight into a very vivid and warped  imagination.<br />For those of you who have seen the movie, this book is a  must-read.  Having read the book several times and seen the movie countless  times (how's about some ice cream, doc? ), I can say that the book not  only fills you in on details which the movie only has time to briefly gloss  over (for instance, what's with the guy in the dog suit near the end of the  movie?), but it also portrays the goings-on in a much different light.  For  instance, having only seen the movie, a viewer may very rightly be under  the impression that Jack has simply gone insane from a severe case of  isolation, and that the boy is simply deranged or possessed.  By outlining  the family's story in Vermont, however, and by giving details of the  hotel's history, the novel enables the reader to understand that the hotel  itself is a tangible character with a personality of its own, and that it  is using the father's weaknesses to get to the boy's remarkable powers.  No  insanity, just pure evil capitalizing on weakness.<br />It's interesting to  note that King disowned the movie.  He did not feel that it accurately  expressed the ideas in the book.  While this is true, let's also agree that  The Shining is a very difficult work to adapt for the screen, and that the  Kubrick film is very good in its own right.  Five or so years ago, a 6 hour  miniseries was made- I believe Rebecca DeMornay was in it... this was  fabulous, a terrifying adaptation of the book.<br />Enjoy!
B000003S0D|5.0|I'm am desperately awaiting the arrival of this CD.  I love King Crimson  and can't wait to hear this version remastered by Fripp.  I ordered it 5  days ago and it still hasn't shipped, so ignore the &quot;usually ships in  24 hours&quot; if you are considering a purchase.  Perhaps there is a  better e-store to use if you are impatient like me.
B00003Q43A|3.0|It was a great idea to put this movie on DVD.  However it's production was  not great at all.  The sound effects and the visual effects were  incredible.  The supplemental disk was equally as good.  The bad thing was  that the voices are horrible.  At some points the voices are really soft  and you can't even pretend to make out what they are saying.  At other  points it's too loud and it fades in and out.  There is also a scene where  the frames stop completely and it really takes away from the mood.  Overall  this DVD could have been a lot better if it was produced better.  Which  raises the question, &quot;Why do you make something and not go over  it?&quot;
B00004WGBE|5.0|This is another great adaptation from BBC.  Great performances from Tara  Fitzgerald, Rupert Graves, and Toby Stephens.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is one of the few books available that seem to  encompass the true meaning of life. Mitch tells the story of his meetings  with his dying professor, Morrie Schwartz. Through these tales we are given  the opportunity to look into the mind of a dying man. Morrie's hopes,  fears, and dreams are given to us with the hope that we may learn from  them. The book feels different because it was written by a journalist not a  novelist. Albom wraps the book up in a way that few authors have mastered.  It may end prematurely, but it leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It is a  heartwarming tale that has the ability to give your day a little more  meaning. The book may not be a challenging read, but it does make a reader  think.
B0000046W9|5.0|this is the mother of all Stan Getz samba collections, this box set  contains virtually every classic Bossa Nova and Samba tune Stan Getz ever  played. Desafinado, Manha De Carnival,  Corcovado, So Danco Samba, It might  As Well Be Spring and of course the timeless Girl from Ipanema. Plus  alternate takes and live performances.  Thank those pesky people at verve  for this wonderful box set.  This collection contains 4cd of Getz  seductively playing. The first two Cd's are primarily instrumentals. The  third is a mixture of instrumentals and singing and the fourth is mostly  singing and some live performances. (The live performances of the girl from  ipanema and corcavado are sublime.) This box set is music that you can get  lost into but 4 samba cd's may  be a little too much for those who are not  Samba enthusiasts or fans of Stan Getz. Perhaps you want to start off with  Jazz Samba or Getz/ Giberto as a sampler of Bossa Nova music but be  forwarned that you may wind up buying this set later after you've fallen in  love with Samba music
B00000IOSU|4.0|I'm new to Sarah McLachan's music but I loved this CD, especially songs like &quot;I Love You&quot; and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; and one  that really gets me going, &quot;Building A Mystery&quot;.
0312954468|3.0|This is the first book I have read by Wilbur Smith.  I loved the backdrop  of ancient Egypt and most of the characters were beautifully portared.   However, the story teller and main character Taita drove me crazy!  He says  that he is the best artist, doctor, architect, inventor, etc, etc that was  ever seen in the Egypt.  Give me a break. <br />Smith has a great talent with  words and his battle scenes are spectacular.  If you are interested in  historical fiction about ancient Egypt then read this book.  If stories  were the main character are so high on themselves bother you than don't  read this book.

0790739356|4.0|Sargent Todd (Kurt Russel) never had a life of his own, till he was tossed  out with the space garbage because they thought he was dead...being alone  is not a handicap for a one man army like Todd as long as fighting is  involved, its all that other stuff that can be painful.  Good action, the  opening training and battle sequences are wonderful, and when it suddenly  switches to lasers and spacesuits instead of fatigues, you get that Forever  War feeling.  All's well that ends with a nuke, must have for Kurt Russel  fans and Those Who Can Never Go Home Again.  I'm rooting for a sequel.
B00000BKDS|5.0|This album is where it all started for Maiden. It proves that they were on  of the best bands of the NWOBHM. This album features original singer Paul  Di'Anno, original drummer Clive Burr who was replaced by Nicko McBrain,  guitarist Dennis Stratton who was replaced by Adrian Smith, and the only  two original members, bass player Steve Harris and guitarist Dave  Murray.<br />The album opens with Prowler. This is easily one of the bast  songs recorded during this era. The song has a great guitar sound and it  also features powerful vocals from Paul Di'Anno. Remember Tomorrow begins  mellow and melodic but it does kick in to some degree. It is more melodic  than heavy. Running Free is a heavy song that begins with upbeat drums  courtesy of Clive Burr. It is a great song. Phantom of the Opera is also  one of the best Maiden songs from this era. It is the longest song on the  album but believe me it's not at all boring. The music is simply amazing.  This song shows what an amazing band they really were. There is amazing  vocal harmonies, guitar solos, and Steve Harris' bass playing is insane.  Transylvania, Sanctuary, and Charlotte the Harlot are heavy fast paced  songs that feature first class musicianship and powerful vocals. Strange  World is a very mellow song, the whole way through. The last song is the  classic, Iron Maiden. This song is performed live to this day. It is truly  an amazing song. One of the best parts about this album is that you really  hear the band's origins as a bar band. This album is nowhere near the Bruce  Dickinson era but it's still worth 5 stars. So you get the idea of how good  the Dickinson albums are. I reccomend this album to anyone intrested in the  NWOBHM or anyone who is just into metal. I don't suggest this for first  time listeners though. If you are getting into Maiden definately get  Powerslave, Piece of Mind, The Number of the Beast, 7th Son of a 7th Son,  Somewhere in Time, and Brave New World. I also strongly suggest Bruce  Dickinson's last 2 solo albums, Accident of Birth and the Chemical Wedding  because they are both amazing.
0790729385|2.0|A modestly entertaining, well-made thriller that has somehow managed to  tap into the collective unconscious in a way that few movies ever have.   <br />I found the film to be occasionally disturbing (never once actually  frightening) and generally convinced that it had something serious to say  about GOOD and EVIL.  What exactly it is that the film has to say about  GOOD and EVIL is never exactly made clear.  The anniversary edition of the  DVD features interviews with William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty, who  speak in hushed tones about the conception/execution of the film, as if  they were discussing the creation of some deep and profound work of art.   However, all of their best intentions/pretensions cannot disguise the fact  that The Exorcist is, in the final analysis, a deeply silly little horror  movie, with nothing really important or especially very interesting to  say.<br />Still, there are a couple of good jolts, though...
B00000J7J4|2.0|This album is just another great example of how pop and top 40 music is  taking over the woorrllddd!!  I'm fifteen years old and have liked Santana  ever since my parents played it for me.  So, when I heard all the talk  about his new album and how great it was supposed to be, I thought to  myself, 'Hey!  Maybe I should go out and buy that!'  So I did. Oh dear.  I  look at the track listing, and EIGHT of the thirteen songs are  &quot;featuring&quot; another artist. Weeeee!  It's too bad that those  songs aren't any good.  Most of the songs that have gotten air time on the  radio sound NOTHING like Santana, and a lot like they should be on the  featured artist's album.  I give this album two stars for the songs that  aren't featuring anyone, like Yaleo and Africa Bamba.  If you want good  music, get Abraxas or Santana or Moonflower.  If you want stuff that sounds  like everything else out there, buy Supernatural!
B000002GQE|3.0|I approached &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; with some trepidation because it was a favorite album of my former high school English teacher  and, sure enough, it fits his personality exactly: unabashedly pompous with  a sense of faux sophistication. The album combines rather stilted  orchestral music with the recitation of poems that are nothing more than  silly, senseless doggerel. Most of the songs on the record are no good  either, being dated or nothing more than straightforward descriptions of  what's happening during some part of the day. The only good songs on the  album are &quot;Peak Hour,&quot; &quot;Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?),&quot;  and the classic, if somewhat overdone &quot;Nights in White Satin.&quot; It  might be a good album to get high to if I did drugs. Oh well. The only  lasting importance is that it foreshadowed later &quot;concept albums&quot;  like &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; But for a year (1967) that saw the  issue of classics like &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot;  the music isn't anything to brag about. If you're really interested in  starting a Moody Blues collection, it would be a good idea to bypass  &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; and buy a greatest hits CD for the decent  songs, instead starting with a good album such as &quot;A Question of  Balance.&quot;
B0000399WI|5.0|Awesome movie!  Tim Robbins is found guilty of a crime he did not commit.  He is locked up in Shawshank for life.  &quot;Red&quot; puts his money on  &quot;Andy&quot; (Tim Robbins) to crack and wind up balling his first night  in.  He doesn't and they slowly become friends because Andy needs stuff and  Red is the man to get it.<br />They continue talking and Andy and Red slowly  become inseperable and little does Red know what Andy is doing.  Andy is  working for the warden as his book keeper(he was a banker on the outside)  and really kept the books. (Watch the movie to find out)  Andy is using the  stuff Red gives him to hide some of Andy's hobbies.  I do not want to give  away the best ending in any movie I have ever seen.  The ending is worth  the price of purchase because you will have never seen anything like it.
034538072X|4.0|Alison Weir has put together here a very fine and detailed study of one of  the most fascinating personages in the history of the British Monarchy -  Henry VIII.  This book is a wonderfully detailed history of each of his  wives.  Each of these six women are presented with clear and surprisingly  fascinating glimpses into their lives.  Especially interesting was the  story of Catherine of Aragon, King Henry's first wife - a steadfast and  quite formidable woman.  It tells of Henry's divorce from her - an act  which she and the Catholic Church refused to acknowledge.  From this  point, however, the book seems to take on the more meticulous voice of a  term paper - a sort of pounding-out of factual information.  Perhaps this  is due to the fact that once the King marries Anne Boleyn, his 2nd wife,  the history becomes packed with dramatic events, rolling one after the  other.  This, I suppose,  would leave very little chance to reflect on the  charactors of any of the remaining five wives.  I shall say this much for  this book, however:  It is rich in information - and for anyone who - like  myself - is fascinated by the history of England - this book is a must!
0812548094|5.0|I noticed somebody giving a review on this after reading 1/3 the book. Such a review should be given only 1/3rd its weight in value in my opinion.  First of, the so called &quot;sexual situations&quot; are directed at  adults. Goodkind say's he writes these books with adults in mind. If there  is so much evil in these fantasy type stories, its only common place that  such gory sex acts might exist too. I don't have a problem with that. If  the reviewer continued reading, he'd know the Sisters of Light are nothing  like the Aes Sedai of Jordans world. In conclusion, this is a fabulous  tale, and I give it 5 stars. I have read all the books in this series and  their wonderful. Each book is nicely concluded and we're not kept hanging.

0671867369|5.0|Stephen Ambrose continues his brilliant abilities in bringing the reader  an account of the 101st Airborne into clear readable prose.  The rigorous  training in which the men at Toccoa, GA would endure, proved vital in the  execution of Operation Overlord, the Battle of the Bulge, and the crossing  of the Rhine to list only a few.  The men which comprised the 506th  Regiment would form a bond possibly unparalleled from that of any other.   Supplying the reader with information in a story manner, is one of the  major attributes of Mr. Ambrose and his writing style, which deviates from  some styles which yield documentation de novo.  For anyone interested in  either Military, World War II, or twentieth century American History as I  am this book is a must read and a keeper for the home library.
B00003CX95|5.0|There is no real place to start, but I will give it a shot.  I am going to keep from saying this is probably the greatest movie of all time,  throughout this review.  I am not Scottish, but there is nothing bad about  this movie.  There are little things and have heard that it is not  historically correct, but come on when the first battle is to begin and Mel  Gibson gives the freedom speech, you cannot help but feel the goose-bumps  and the hair standing up on the back of your neck!  You can not even hear  any of the Aussie in Gibson and gives maybe the performance of his life.   The story of a Man fighting for freedom and for the love of his fallen  wife, how can women not like this movie too.  I watched it with my fiance  last week and we both were in tears at the end.  Its got, fighting, great  story, great acting, awesome lines, and how could you live with yourself if  you do not have this one?  &quot;Every man dies, not every man really  lives,&quot; to quote William Wallace (Mel Gibson).  Feel the goose-bumps  they are telling you to get this great movie!
B00004S6GL|5.0|BUY IT NOW!  You will not regret it.  This is an outstanding album.
630438551X|5.0|When I first saw this movie I didn't understand a word, but I still really  enjoyed it.  It's spectacular, funny, and I think the way Luhrmann got it  into the 1990s is brilliant.  The actors are brilliant, although Dicaprio  does seem too weak ('wimpy' in my brother's vocab) compared to the rest.   Maybe I enjoyed it so much because the place it's set in seems so different  to what I know, but it needs to be a very bright, OTT movie because you're  working with words that the average audience won't understand and so you  need to make it visually appealing.  I think it's v. sad that some people  feel that there's no meaning in it - what about the original play's  meaning?  The movie does have some weepy and touching bits - it's not all  blazes of glory.  It's great!
B000005H4K|5.0|As has been noted, a rousing success is not always guaranteed by putting  three great musicians together to cut an album, but this CD succeeds  wonderfully. I was a little leery of the fact that Max Roach (easily the  best of the bebop and hardbop drummers) was with the Duke, but his playing  is not only non-intrusive, it lends itself well to the trio's goal. Mingus'  bass is completely different from any I've heard. Unlike most, he utilizes  the full range of his instrument, going considerably higher than other  bassists. Then there is always the Duke, whose genius is evident throughout  the entire CD, as most of the tracks (Maybe all, I don't remember) are his.  Well worth the money (har har).
0790729628|3.0|No DD5.1 oke i can live with that  but the picture isn't all that  I noticed that the picture isn't filling up at the side of the screen, it  leaves black bars (a few centimeters) at the left and the right of the  screen. If you want a blade runner dvd in your collection look further for  a different version <br />But the movie is good
B00000K19E|5.0|I am not going to get into any sci-fi philosophy of this movie because it may scare some away.  Here is what you do to really enjoy this movie.  The  first time you watch, just do that, watch it do not think about everything  that is going on just watch, and absorb it.  Second time pay more attention  to the movie, think about it, ponder all the ideas in it.  Third time look  for things and lines you did not see or make sense.  When all this is done  watch it again and realize you are watching a great movie.  Keanu and  Laurence give great performances and are a great duo.  The plot is a little  complicated, but makes the movie great.  I can not wait to see more of  &quot;Neo (Keanu)&quot; being the &quot;chosen one&quot; in the sequels!   When he does at the end of this movie it is bad ass!
B000002MTR|4.0|About a year ago, I first heard the album that would change the way I listened to music forever, it was Californication, one of the best rock  albums ever put out.  Like One Hot Minute, Californication has 2 of the  original 4 founding members (Bassist-Flea, and Lead singer Anthony Kiedis).   However, One Hot Minute is missing a key element that all of the albums  since Mother's Milk have had-  brilliant and gifted guitarist, John  Frusciante.  Pinch hitting for John, is Jane's Addiction guitarist, Dave  Navarro.  Though some tracks stand out (Aeroplane, My Friends, Pea), this  album fails to capture the magic of Californication, Blood Sugar Sex Magic,  and even Mother's Milk.  The concepts are all vain and weak. (with the  notable exceptions of tearjerker and My Friends).Unlike these  3, I was not  moved by this album at all, nor did it make me want to get up and move.  If  you are just getting into the Peppers, check out BSSM, and Californication  after you listen to one hot minute, because if you hear either of these  marvelous treats before OHM, you will not be able to apperciate it as well.   To fans of Dave Navarro:  he is a great guitarist, but, obviously, he's no  pepper. a very generous 4 stars.
B000002N2P|5.0|I remember getting this cd way back in 1995.  It was my 10th birthday  party in December 95 and my best friend bought the cd for me.  I went up to  my room with my friends and put the cd in my cd player. I listened to the  cd about 10 times that night, i was in love with this music i had never  heard.  That was when i first started getting into punk music and started  playing the guitar.  Now that I am 14, this cd still is an inspiration to  me and the way i live.  I think this cd is soooo much better than Dookie or  Nimrod.  The punk blasts out from you speakers and you instantly become  mesmorized by the music and lyrics.  It is pure 100% energy and makes you  want to jump around and start singing along.  Although Nimrod and Dookie  are great cd's, this cd is always in my cd changer now along with Sublime's  Selftitled cd.  The screaming guitars and driving lyrics make my insides  rumble.  Eventhough it never met the sales of Nimrod or Dookie, I think it  is the greatest Green Day cd and one of the greatest 32:56 ever produced by  any band.  Everybody should have this cd and i cant wait for WARNING:  October 3rd. Thank you Green Day.

The author begins by stating a simple premise: \\"One must not only consider a vocal  minority now but also consider everyone in the long run.\\" &quot;Duh!&quot;  you might say, as I did. Then he lists time and time again when governments  have tried to band-aid social and economic problems with disastrous  results. &quot;Farmers are doing bad? Subsidize! People are homeless? Cap  the cost of housing! People are poor? Raise the minimum wage!&quot; These  suggestions all seem to make sense--at least in the short term for those  directly affected. I was surprised how amazingly eye-opening this book was.  If you are classically swing toward the left side of the political spectrum  read this book for a reality check. If you tend to be Laissez Faire this  book will give you great ammo for your next political discussion.<br />For  someone with no economic background, this book has inspired me to keep  reading. This would be a great gift for politicians who like to practice  \\"Feel Good\\" politics.
0446525537|5.0|In the prologue, Nicholas Sparks says first you will smile and then you will cry. It happened to me just that way.  I laughed and smirked during the first half and I cried buckets full of tears during the last half of  this book. I must of read the last line about ten times before it began to  sink in. I'm still unsure of his true meaning. This is a very powerful  book. You feel like you are a 17 year old boy on his journey into  adulthood.  It grabs you and you won't want to put it down. This was the  first book that I have read by Nicholas Sparks, but it won't be the last
B000000HTM|5.0|Just translating the beautiful words our friend LUDOVIGI from Bolzano  wrote for you guys:<br />-listening to &quot;Pawnhearts&quot; after 29 years  still sends chills on my back; a dive in the tepid water of my adolescence,  made of illusions and dreams, but also made of intense sensations and  emotions. An unforgettable experience that I always bring inside and that  now just surfaced: I sought after the old vinyl records, looked at those  with &quot;nostalgia&quot; but with no regrets. I've grown up &quot;bread  and Peter Hammill&quot; and VdGG contributed to my growth as I am now,  too.<br />I subscribe every word: this is a piece of my personal history AND  OF ALL OUR GENERATION, I guess!!!  :-)
B00004T2FQ|5.0|There is no equall to Pavarotti as the duke. No doubt. You'll hear no  better &quot;questa o quella&quot; and no better &quot;bella figlia  dellamore&quot; This alone is a good reason to buy this disc.  Sutherland,  as brilliant as ever, gives the best &quot;caro nome&quot; I've heard, and  Milnes is an exellent Rigoletto. The &quot;supporting&quot; roles are sung  beautifully, all and all a great recording, with one flaw - Richard Bonyng  is no Verdi conductor. He should stick to bell canto. His conducting makes  few of the duets, trios and quartets less pretty than they could have been.  but mostly he doesn't harm the music much, and he conducts the solos well.  All and all - the best rigoletto I've heard.  Buy!
B000002JEV|5.0|Wow. What an album. This is my favorite Led Zeppelin album, and I own them all. With disc 1, it is a bunch of their earlier, kinda bluesy, stuff from  different shows. The first version of &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;  is the best of the three. The highlight of this disc, in my opinion, is  &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues,&quot; which is probably their best song  that was never released on an official studio album. (Between this and Hey  hey What Can I Do) It features the raw sexuality of Robert Plant and some  awesome guitar work from Jimmy Page.  The second disc is all from the same  show. It starts out with &quot;Immigrant Song.&quot; It is a good version  but not as good as the studio one. &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; is the second  song. Better than the studio version, it includes a mind boggling solo from  Jimmy Page. Definitely a classic. &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is  Led Zep's best blues tune. The power in Robert Plant's voice in this song  will blow you away. They put so much emotion into all of their  performances, this song especially defines that. These recordings took  place about 8 months before the untitled album came out. Bonzo and Jimmy  fool the crowd with their &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; intro. They then  jump straight into &quot;Black Dog,&quot; the first of three sneak peeks  into their new album. &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; although EXTREMELY  long, still is not bad. The crowd will then get the second look into Led  Zep's fourth album with &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; This is the first  time anyone other than those associated with Led Zeppelin heard the song.  What a way to introduce the best song of all time. Jimmy's solo is plainly  remarkable. It is odd to hear a band so in synch with each other at a live  performance as Led Zeppelin is on this song. I like this version better  than both the studio version and the TSRTS version. Their last look into  the upcoming album comes with &quot;Going to California.&quot; A beautiful  love song with good guitar work yet again. &quot;That's the Way&quot;  features Robert Plant's voice at it's best. People often criticize him for  his voice, in my opinion, he has the best voice ever. (in rock that is) The  &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; medley is nothing short of phenomenal. It is  cut in half by ten minutes of pure blues jamming. This one seems to be the  crowd's favorite. &quot;Thank You&quot; is a great way to end the  performance. John Paul Jones' keyboard work is great on this one. The first  time you listen to this you will be expecting the same mellow version that  is on &quot;LZII.&quot; It is up until Jimmy's solo that is unbelievable.  It is his best solo on the album. Bonzo also stands out on this song.  The  second disc in particular features Led Zeppelin entering their prime.  Pretty good for the best band ever. Ignore everyone that says Led Zeppelin  is an over rated band. You cannot rate the best band of all time. Buy this  album, it will blow you away.
006109594X|1.0|Fans of WWII submairne lore may recall the story of the Shinano, the  Japanese super carrier sunk by a brace of merely six American torpedoes.   Desperate to get their carrier to sea, the Japanese failed to make the ship  sea-worthy, and an attack that couldn't have crippled the ship, instead  found one already full of holes.  &quot;Nimitz Class&quot;, the  technothriller in which one of America's mammoth super carriers is reduced  to radioactive dust on the sea, looks like swiss cheese next to the  ill-fated Shinano.  Though publicly blaming the incident on a catastrophic  reactor failure, a team of USN experts of astoundingly dubious ethic  homogeneity quickly settle on nuclear terrorism.  Though the signs point to  a rogue diesel sub helmed by a master submariner, how the attackers managed  to slip past carrier defenses that were trained to hunt them down is never  satisfactorily explained.  Instead, author Robinson hides behind the usual  technothriller devices - hints at Hussein and mideast terrorists (though I  had to go back to the novel to remind myslef which of Iran or Iraq  ultimately gets the blame), rogue Russians, a brilliant lone-wolf USN  nuclear expert, tough talking American brass (who are so uniformly white  and male, they make the cast of &quot;Midway&quot; look positively  multi-cultural) and a blizzard of details of dubious accuracy and even less  dramatic value.  More than any technothriller I can remember, &quot;Nimitz  Class&quot; seems in awe of its perceived ability to create a plot built on  the author's seeming mastery of details.  The first few pages are a prime  example, as the author draws life aboard the doomed carrier, filled with an  eye towards the nuts and bolts of its operation and filled with laughably  shallow versions of its crew.  That the author fails miserably at this,  when others have succeeded seems laughable when, only a few pages later,  the rogue sub strikes and cardbord carrier and it's cartoon crew is no  more.  <br/>What the author's technobabble does a better job of is covering  up how unsure the author was about his own story.  Whodunit?  Robinson hits  on the usual suspects, and I needed die@usa.com's review to remind me who  ultimately gets the blame.  The author crafts a complex web to explain how  the perps got paid, but that seems unneccesarily convoluted.  Robinson hits  on an intriguing idea, one involving rogue Israelis (yeah, they've got  subs) but, not waiting to develop the idea or its charachters, Robinson  twists the idea again, and pretty soon, I stopped caring who paid for the  job.  By the end, having already suspended our belief, Robinson adds the  final cheat: there is no climactic battle between the rogue sub and the  hero - or any other developed charachter.  Instead, in a major  miscalculation, Robinson hinges the story on his hero's ability to match  the rogue submariner's seemingly impossible feat of transiting from  Russia's Black Sea HQ, through the Bhosporous and into the Med - submerged.   Only  seeing proof that this feat is possible will convince the US  President to spend the billions needed to hunt the rogue sub down;  one  would think that the lost carrier was enough proof (they'd have to spend  billions to fix the reactors and weapons of the other ships if the  sub-story were not true and poor weapons really were to blame, and aren't  subhunters at sea supposedly looking for hostile subs anyway?) Once the  hero accomplishes this, other subs take to the sea to hunt the rogue down -  and the success is bleakly unsatisfying.  Some kind of submarine dogfight,  though the predictable resolution, would have required a greater feel for  the dynamics of submarine warfare than the author displays, and would have  likely forced the author to actually develop the mystery submariner  himself, who appears in no more than a few italicized lines throught the  novel.  want some submarine thrills, get &quot;Red October&quot;  &quot;Potemkin&quot; or anything by Poyer, or rent &quot;The Bedford  Incident&quot;, based on a superior novel in its own right.  As for  &quot;Nimitz Class&quot;, two diving planes, way down!!
6302491940|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said about this film.  It is a  classic.  First seen at the age of 10 and watched religously several times  a year after that.  It has everything a good film should, comedy,  charactirasation, Michael Caine and Mini coppers. Not only is it funny but  it is absorbing.  The perfect way to get a feel for London and Italy in the  60's if like me you weren't there.  If you appreaciate a good film you will  appreciate this. Well worth spalshing out on.
B00003OSSM|4.0|I love to watch both Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas in feature movies. So when I found out they would be in a movie together, I thought it would be fantastic. While I wasn't jumping for joy in the aisle at the movie theater, I did still like the film. It's the kind of movie that you have to see more than once to really appreciate.  You have to give both of these actors credit. Both of them did a great job with the material they had to work with. Harrison Ford never seems to be afraid of being disliked as a main character. I particularly enjoyed the way his character and Kristin's approoach the same situation with different emotions for thier grieving process.  It just goes to show that people really do grieve in different ways, not all of them are very obvious.  Like Kristin Scott Thomas' character.  Kristen always seems to play the repressed or emotionally complex characters the best.  She says one thing through dialouge, but tells you how she really feels with her eyes and body language.  Now that's a great actress!  The whole time she's telling Dutch that she's \\"done with them\\", she's really saying that she just doesn't want to grieve in the same painful public way that he is.  It fits the character since Kay is supposed to be this public figure that can't show her real emotions on the surface, lest she cause a political scandal.  Finally, I really think Syndey Pollack didn't take advantage of the editing and soundtrack. My biggest complaint is with the soundtrack. David Grusin was used throughout most of the film. While I generally like Dave Grusin as a jazz artist, his soundtrack recordings have not been the best. I mean, I loved the music on its own.  But in my opinion, he set the mood of the film. He also did the soundtrack for \\"The Fabulous Baker Boys\\", which I also liked. But he set a depressing mood for that film also. But then again, both movies dealt with depressing subject matter.  So what do we expect?  I think that mainstream America is way too concerned with explosions and a WWF mentality when it comes to movies nowadays.  Everything is so emotionally shallow, or it's just a grossed-out movie that's supposed to pass for comedy.  I'm almost too afraid to waste my time any more.  Everything is so fake!  I think people don't want anything that's close to real life anymore, like this underrated, unappreciated movie.  Everytime I see it, I like it more and more.  It's better than the alternative out there!
B00004R99J|4.0|When I heard Pocahontas was coming out on dvd I got excited, as it is one  of Disney's greatest achievements. OK it doesnt have the pazazz of Aladdin  or the stand out sequences such as the stampede in the lion king, but you  really feel for the characters. The features on Pocahontas face are really  touching, and boy is she cute! The music is fantastic, I particularly enjoy  colours of the wind, but also the rousing chorus of savages, when  pocahontas runs to save john smith. Alan Menkins score really adds impact  to the emotional scenes. The one reason, this disc didn't win full marks  wasn't for the quality of the film, but of the disc. The picture was  remarkably grainy, the worst I have seen of a disney disc, even Pinocchio  from the 1940's was crisper, come  on disney ! Aside from that one gripe, I  would recommend Pocahontas to anyone, the kids may find it a little slow,  but they will find enjoyment in the escapades of flit, meeko and percy.
B000005HN6|5.0|I am no nationalist, I am actually VERY international, so dont take this  as &quot;Oh Im so proud of being Swedish&quot;-arrogance, BUT Swedish  Black Metal has the most beautiful sound, 'cause the melancholic sound of  old swedish folk music influences does it high-class, God, this CD makes me  cry!!!!!!!! Opeth = GODS!!! If Ya dont have it, get it now NOW NOW!
B000002UJQ|5.0|a stunner.  virtuosity embodied.  frighteningly diverse music, cryptically written lyrics, and persistent dynamism, all rolled into a well-played and  -sung set of songs.  dare ye ignore this one?  perhaps -- but I warn ye,  doing so is to risk great peril.<br />fergit yer &quot;top 1000&quot; or  &quot;top 100&quot; or even &quot;top 10&quot; lists, this one is the ONLY  one.  ye'll get no &quot;critic&quot; mumbo-jumbo from me.  this album  can't be defined, by cracky! ...nor can it be adequately described.  if you  care AT ALL, even one subatomic particle's worth, about the state of music,  then buy this disc.  fork over the paltry $7-15 (used to new) and slap on  the headphones or get into a closed, dark room, and play play play this one  over over over.  you will draw your own conclusions as to what Radiohead  want you to see, feel, think and hear on this one.  Praise God for these  inventive young men!
014028009X|5.0|This book is just great! It's about Bridget Jones life and let me tell  you, she has a life. To her it might not be funny but for us to read. I  liked the person she was, not perfect but not bad. Everything in her life  is not funny, like the problems she has: finding a guy, being a bad  cook.... I'm not going to tell you more about the content, it's up to you  to read it and I don't think you're going to find the ending bad.
B000002WCJ|5.0|help me see, the best way to be make a change and we, live eternally no  more wasted years, no more wasted tears life´s too short to cry, long  enough to try<br />Gotta love 'em!!!!
B000002UB3|2.0|I guess what some people see as a &quot;suite&quot; (where did THAT come  from) I see as a group that could write a riff but couldn't complete any  verses to go with it.  Let's see.  Exactly how long is Polythene Pam? A  minute, maybe? The End? 15 seconds?  Yeah. Great songs on this one.  Maybe  Rob Thomas could help finish up these songs. 2-stars.
0449002632|4.0|Michener's readers know the problem well. Too much history and it's not  good fiction; too much fiction and it's unsatisfying history. Rutherford's  solution is to write large sprawling works that are really short story  cycles. In Sarum, he pulled it off beautifully, with nicely linked tales  that added up to a greater whole. Ruska didn't quite make it, and  ultimately comes across as barely related short stories featuring  characters with recycled names.<br />London splits the difference. Not quite  as tightly woven as sarum, but with more unity than Ruska, this series of  tales builds a detailed and impressive picture of London through the  centuries. It's peopled with a multitude of nicely drawn characters who  show their family ties and wear their family history well.<br />Rutherford has  a particularly fine eye for geography and architecture, and while it may  seem that the story occasionally sags while we take a short travelogue,  it's this attention to detail that is one of the book's great pleasures.  And Rutherford saves a neat little plotting device (reminiscent of  Michener's Centennial) to give some closure to the whole thing.<br />Think of  the city as the main character, keep one finger on the page with the  character's family trees (but try not to peek ahead!) and enjoy!
B000002BQK|5.0|Even though this album is 3 years old, it still lingers on! This is the  album that turned me into a Mariah Fanatic! All songs are soulful, hip, and  great! If you're sick of the blonde singers (Britney Spears, etc..) Then  this is the singer to turn too! Here is a review of her songs.<br />1.Honey-  Very hip, great choice for the first song on this album, makes you wanna  listen to the whole album. 10/10<br />2.Butterfly- Great song again, the  albums name. Very refreshing and soft. The lyrics are great and Mariah's  voice is perfect. 10/10<br />3.My All- Now this is another good song, but not  Great in my opinion, the background drowns out Mariahs wonderful voice. But  its very 'European'. Still a good song though, it gets a 9/10<br />4.The  Roof-Hip, Edgy, modern, and sort of rap style for Mariah, another good  song. 9.5/10<br />5.Fourth of July-Definately an awesome song! I think they  shouldof made a video of this one. I love the background music and jungle  like noises and stuff. This is one of the best songs on the album.  10/10<br />6.Breakdown- Very catchy and good tune. I really like this song.  Glad they made a video off of it. 10/10<br />7.Babydoll- Rap-like, kinda neat  with the vocalist in the background. 9.5/10<br />8.Close My Eyes-A  Masterpiece! Very emotional like, i LOVE this song, it almost puts a tear  in your eye. 10/10<br />9.Whenever You Call-a good song, good tune.  9/10<br />10.Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)- Very cool reprise, so it would have  12 songs.<br />11. The Beautiful Ones- Hip, kinda strange vocals and  background music. I think a little too many 'baby,baby,baby's 8.5/10<br />12.  Outside-A good ending song, slow and peaceful 10/10<br />Hope this review  helped! I think any Mariah fans should definately add this album to there  collection! Its also good for people who just heard of Mariah Carey!
B00000DC4A|5.0|Every track on this album is good, some are excellent ('How Do Ya Feel  Tonight', 'I'm A Liar' and 'I Don't Wanna Live Forever') and two of them  are masterpieces. We all know the nice 'On A Day Like Today', Bryan's  musical adventure with Mel 'When You're Gone' and the remixed 'Cloud Number  Nine'. The two songs I hold in my heart are 'Inside Out' and 'Where Angels  Fear To Tread'. The last song is mostly for the melody, but 'Inside Out'  will remain in my top-10 songs for a long time: never have I heard such  touching lyrics, where Bryan tells a girl he wants to know her inside out.  &quot;The biggest lie you ever told/you're deepest fear 'bout growing  old/the longest night you ever spent/the angriest letter you never sent/the  boy you swore you'd never leave/the one you kissed on New Year's Eve/the  sweetest dream you had last night/your darkest hour, your hardest  fight&quot; and he continues &quot;the sadest song you ever heard/the most  you said with just one word/the loneliest prayer you ever prayed/the truest  vow you ever made/what makes you laugh, what makes you cry/what makes you  mad, what gets you by/your highest high, your lowest low/these are the  things I wanna know&quot;.<br />Some may say Bryan turned pop or got soft, I  say he discovered real beauty... Thanks Bryan! Keep on rocking the world  like you did in Flanders Expo, Gent (Belgium) in october '99!
047158651X|5.0|Speaking as someone who suffered through what might be termed a  &quot;traditional&quot; biochemistry sequence as an undergraduate (i.e.  scads of memorization of every metabolic pathway on the planet; minimal  emphasis on applying what you learned in general and organic chemistry to  the class since it was assumed the premeds taking the class had forgotten  it), the first time I read V &amp; V was a breath of fresh air.  I felt  that biochemistry was not some obscure dark magic, but rather something  that connected to the rest of chemistry.    Now in what is termed  &quot;biophysics&quot; ( I have a B.S. in chem and a doctoral degree in  physics), I still reach for Voet and Voet whenever I need to check some  obscure fact for whatever it is that I may be doing.  To the 17 year old  who said that all that chemistry stuff is &quot;uncomprehendable&quot;,  well, unless you've taken organic, inorganic and physical chemistry at a  university level, it most likely is to you.  However, for those of us who  are actually trained in the physical sciences, Voet and Voet is the only  real choice.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is a great all around movie. It has invented a whole race of fx for current movie hits &quot;The Matrix&quot; &quot;Star Wars&quot; and  so on. Perhaps the DTS 5.1 channel sound that you enjoy at the movies is  the biggest impact. Now,the movie, it is so real! The T-rexs and the  raptors are  so scary. People say it has a bad plot and it's basic, yeah,  they probaly didn't even know what DNA or cloning was. I mean this movie  came out before they cloned an animal! Michael Crichton is a genius! Also  what about The Lost World the only reason people gave it bad reviews is  because they thought it was going to be as good as JP.Tell me how many  movies as good as JP are going to come within 20 years of each other? If I  could I'd give JP 100 stars! Thank you Steven for making a great movie!
B00000DGUM|3.0|I love this band. They were one of the best 80s' bands. They wrote great  songs and has some incredible musical ability.<br />Too bad this &quot;Best  Of&quot; collection is lacking more than a few great songs. The tracks  &quot;Big Guns&quot;, &quot;Sweet Little Sister&quot;, &quot;Makin A  Mess&quot; and &quot;Midnight Tornado&quot; should have been put on here in  place of the mediocre songs from &quot;Subhuman Race&quot;, which I did not  like. Like Warrant, this band had two good albums. Then they tried to  conform to the growing popularity of &quot;alternative&quot; and lost their  touch. And now Sebastian Bach is out of the band. I feel that, like  Warrant, this once great band's best work is behind them. A shame, really.

B00000JCOV|4.0|This band, is probably the best band to ever hit the heavy metal scene,  cory the vocalist (#8) has a great sisnging voice as in &quot;wait and  bleed&quot; he can scream very good too, as in &quot;(sic)&quot; there is 9  masked men in this band. buy the CD, its a great CD to add to your  collection.
B00003CWNR|4.0|Director Lasse Hallstrom, who gave us the beautiful &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape?&quot;, admirably presents the nuances of character, emotion,  and relationships that make John Irving's bittersweet adaptation of his own  novel so compelling. Michael Caine, his American accent aside, excels as  the parternal Dr. Larch and Tobey Maguire is well-cast as Homer, the  doe-eyed youth who ventures from the familial orphanage to experience life.  The cinematography is exquisite and evocative. As Homer ultimately learns,  the validity of the Cider House Rules (and, by extension, all rules) is  subjective; but, by the time we reach this epiphany, it hardly seems  revelatory considering Homer was raised by an abortionist, and one who  taught him the trade, at that. There is a lot of love here, but also a  moral ambivalence. In this film, as in life, there are no easy answers.  It's for you to decide. Just be sure you see it.
B00000DATR|5.0|Mike Oldfield really blew me away with this CD. This has become my  favorite of his CDs, even though his other CDs are awsome. Even if you have  never heard Mike Oldfield, or don't like his other CDs, this one may change  your opinion. It is by far the best music of its type, and some of the best  music I have ever heard. Even if you only have just enough money to buy  this CD, you should buy it. If you don't have enough money, then GET TO  WORK! You need this CD. As one of the other reviews said, this CD really  has a great ending, but I would like to see a Tubular Bells IV. The Tubular  Bells trilogy has been my favorite of his CDs, and I want to see him  continue in that venue. JUST BUY THIS CD!
B000000OF6|5.0|Although Queen now has three seperate collections of their greatest hits,  this one surely combines their most meaningful and musical pieces. From the  well known classics such as Bohemian Rhapsody, to their newer works such as  We are the Champions; Queen will always be amongst us. Their unique style  of Opera-style classic rock can be listened to for hours and hours without  rest. Freddie Mercury provides possibly the most impressive vocals among  other lead singers in seperate bands. This CD is worth every dime you spend  on it!
B00000IQBN|5.0|Stanley Kubrick did an excellent job recreating the 1700's in style, costume and scenery.  Ryan O'Neal portrays a rogue excellently and he is  captivating in the role of Barry Lyndon who is a dashing and charming \\"gentleman of distinction\\".  The movie starts when Lyndon is  exiled from his home and made to join the British Army, there Lyndon's life  story takes various twists and turns.  O'Neal and the rest of the cast make  this an entertaining movie to watch. Another great movie by the late Stanley Kubrick.  The cinematography is outstanding.  A critic described the unique locations and lighting, and overall photography of the movie as high renaissance art on film.  I definitely agree.  The music is haunting in the movie and the narration adds tremendously. Highly recommended!
B00004T9UF|5.0|this cd is pure. well to me its pure. every single song has a meaning, which in some cases is wicked funny. many people don't take eminem for  granted, but if you listen to his songs he definetely has a point. my  favorite songs are &quot;kill you&quot;, &quot;marshall mathers&quot;, and  &quot;criminal&quot;. i have a word of advice. get the UN-CENSORED version,  because if you don't your buying a cd full of mutes and beeps. so ending  this review i definetly give this cd a pure gold 5 stars!

0684803356|5.0|This is the most profoundly emotional book that I've ever read, and the  only book that ever made me cry. It's the one book they rarely make you  read in english class, because there isn't any pretentious allegory to  uncover--it's just a great story, pure and simple, about human beings  fighting impossible odds in a desperate attempt to make the world a better  place. The characters are so real that their passion and pain and thoughts  stay with you long after the book is over...the last 100 pages are, in my  opinion, the most exciting and moving pages in literature. And Hemingway's  message is one that every human being should know...
B00003CWTH|5.0|There are the three hours of running time, the group sing-along and the raining amphibians to contend with, of course.  There's the question of Tom  Cruise's performance, as well, undeniably forceful, yet a touch shrill and  mannered for my taste.  Yet, even with the excesses and the one or two  story-lines that careen into a dead-end, I'm in awe of this picture.  PT  Anderson, America's finest young filmmaker, worked on two excellent movies  before this (I'm especially impressed with &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;), but  who could have expected such an awesome, ambitious, utterly outrageous  monster like &quot;Magnolia&quot; on only his third try?  It was brazen  enough to cop his narrative framework whole from Robert Altman (cf.  &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, etc.).  To up the stakes  with a climactic plot device directly out of Exodus was audacious beyond  belief and, whether it works or not, you can't fault the guy for laziness  or lack of vision.  Indeed, this is a visionary work of art, one that gazes  directly at the tempest of modern life (and death) without flinching.  I'm  still not sure, despite all the ink that's been spilled on the subject, if  the &quot;plague of frogs&quot; is there to suggest that human lives are  governed by Fate (aka God) or that coincidences and freak occurences simply  happen, devoid of any meaning or motive, and that we must simply note and  embrace them.  Perhaps, the director-writer wasn't even sure himself.  At  the very least, he had me thinking about such things, which is a rare  accomplishment for a &quot;mainstream&quot; American movie these days.  I  have to wonder if there's a stronger actress than Julianne Moore currently  gracing the screen.  She's absoltuely stunning here, in what must have been  a quite challenging role.  The sequence where she faces down a pair of  meddling pharmacists is itself worth the price it will cost to rent or buy  this film.  The fact that she's matched strengh for strength bya huge  ensemble cast that includes John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melora  Walters, Phillip Baker Hall, Melinda Dillon, William H. Macy and the great  Jason Robards only reaffirms what was obvious from Anderson's previous two  outings:  He's a great actor's director, capable of coaxing strong  performances from even mediocre talent (ie. Gwenyth Paltrow's haunting  portrayal in &quot;Hard Eight&quot;). Whatever its failings and however  self-indulgent it can, at times, be, I find this a profound film, rich with  the details and textures or real life.  That Aimee Mann's marvelous songs  take such a central role is only icing on the cake.  See this movie for  yourself--you may love it, you may hate it, but it will make you think.
0684803356|5.0|This is the most profoundly emotional book that I've ever read, and the  only book that ever made me cry. It's the one book they rarely make you  read in english class, because there isn't any pretentious allegory to  uncover--it's just a great story, pure and simple, about human beings  fighting impossible odds in a desperate attempt to make the world a better  place. The characters are so real that their passion and pain and thoughts  stay with you long after the book is over...the last 100 pages are, in my  opinion, the most exciting and moving pages in literature. And Hemingway's  message is one that every human being should know...
B000009QPQ|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the finest American records of all time, and  the Jayhawks' finest hour.  If you buy no other CD by the Jayhawks, then  buy this one.  If you buy two, buy this one &amp; Smile.

B00001NFCY|4.0|I think its a great album, great songs. Inspiring Lyrics. Scott has a  powerful voice, and the band knows how to please its fans. Human Clay,  probably did so well because Creed, instead of going into new ground,  played it safe and gave the fans more of what they love. NOW, I don't mind  that. But PLEASE!!! For the third album CHANGE CHANGE CHANGE! If these guys  wanna last, they need to experiment and find there own sound. Like Stone  Temple Pilots did with &quot;songs of the vatican&quot; which erased them   of there &quot;They sound like Pearl Jam&quot; reputation. Scott also needs  to experiment with his voice, try different tons and moods. Whisper,  scream, but don't stay so monotone throughout the album.   Almost every  song on Human Clay can be compared to a My own Prison song. (Whats this  life for=With arms wide open) Keep up the good songs Creed! Just grow and  don't be afraid to try something new! Rock On!

0671027344|5.0|I love this book, it's simply wonderful.  I would recomend it to anyone in  highschool or those who want to relive those memories.
B000006045|5.0|its just one of those cds that you dont grow tired of.this recording is  dark,moody,melodic,soft,refined,expressive and simply stunning.with  beatiful singing around every bend,there are only two tracks where you get  an actual sense of rap on it which are risingson and inertia creeps and  both are absolutely amazing as well as the rest of the album.if youre new  to trip-hop or are just curious check this out you wont be  dissapointed-later
B000002OZY|5.0|If The Who had never recorded &quot;Tommy,&quot; there never would've been  &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway,&quot; or &quot;The Wall,&quot; or  &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar,&quot; or &quot;War Of The Worlds.&quot; Or  The Who's follow-up concept album, &quot;Quadrophenia,&quot; for that  matter. Yes, &quot;Tommy&quot; was the world's first rock opera, and it  still stands today as a landmark album in the history of rock. Pete  Townshend &amp; company crafted a rock album whose music is brilliantly  intelligent, passionate, beautiful, and kicks major rear-end in the rock  department. It also tells a fascinating story, as it's narrative about the  pinball-playing deaf dumb &amp; blind boy holds up amazingly well from  start to finish. The Who have always been one of the world's greatest rock  bands, and their earlier albums showed that they could do British  &quot;Mod&quot; music like no other band in existence. But with  &quot;Tommy,&quot; The Who showed what rock music could BE. I can't  recommend this album enough---add &quot;Tommy&quot; to your CD collection,  and let The Who take you, right along with Tommy himself, on an amazing  journey.
0800136586|1.0|I am surprised to see how many people actually enjoyed this horrible slice of cinema. Now, I have not been an &quot;Annie&quot; fan for long-- I saw  my first production of it in the summer of '99, and I was so thrilled with  it, I rented the movie right away. I was appalled almost right away. Here  are my top 10 reasons for hating this movie: 10. &quot;The Hard-Knock  Life&quot; sequence-- it looked like they were on a playground, not in an  orphanage. 9. Toni Ann Gisondi-- I hated her as Molly. Just not cute  enough. 8. The new arrangements of many of the songs. I especially disliked  &quot;I Don't Need Anything But You&quot; and &quot;I Think I'm Gonna Like  It Here.&quot; 7. Ann Reinking-- Grace is supposed to be a soprano. Hello?  6. Punjab-- Okay, so he was a character in the comic strip, but there was  absolutely no reason for him to be in this movie. 5. Carol Burnett-- What  in the hell was that performance about? I love her in everything I've ever  seen her in, except this. She was way too over the top, even for Miss  Hannigan, and that's saying a lot considering it's already an over the top  character. 4. The added songs. Personally, I disliked all of them, but one  in particular comes to mind-- &quot;Dumb Dog.&quot; 3. Annie hanging off a  drawbridge-- don't even get me started. 2. Aileen Quinn-- vocally, she was  halfway decent I suppose, but had all the charm and charisma of a rock, and  all the acting skills necessary for portraying a wooden board. 1. The  omission of &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; Sure, they sang it over the opening  credits, and sang the White House version, but it never really was a  crucial part to the storyline, as in the play. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is the  best song of the whole show, and we, the audience, couldn't listen to it  all because John Huston didn't like it. Personally, I preferred the Disney  version of the film much better. Although it was shortened, it was much  truer to the original story with a much more talented cast to tell that  story.
B000006MS3|5.0|In this album, Kate Bush truly lets herself create a piece of work. This  album may not be for everyone, but to a true Kate Bush fan it is a must  have. Best tracks if you can pick from them since they are all so brillant,  are Sat In Your Lap, and one of my personal favorites Leave It Open. Please  get this album and enter the world of Kate Bush. Also Hounds of Love is a  great introduction to Kate Bush's music.
0312854021|5.0|If you have not read this book get out there and read it! It is more than  a story about a terrible war. It is the growth of and incredible character  and how he is shaped into humanitiy's tool. And, in doing this discovers  himself, both the good and the bad. Ender is one of the best characters in  literature. It is an incredible read written eloquently by Mr. Card. I  reccomend this to everyone.
B000002BVN|5.0|Okay,<br />The new material Jackson offers on this disc is incredible. BOTDF  is a great jam about a woman named Susie who Jackson meets, and then  backstabs him.<br />Morphine is simply on of Jacksons greatest acvhievements.  He not only plays the guitar and drums on the track, but also did the  arranging and orchestrations for it as well. This is Michael at his  angriest. One of those songs to listen to after a hard day. The middle  eight is particularly creepy talking about drug addiction on multiple  levels. Lyrics range from outright violent to surreal (Comfortably  Numb).<br />Superfly sister is the albums groove R&amp;B track. Overall great  production and music from Jackson.<br />Ghosts is another masterpiece. Rather  than the ghosts being of the supernatural type Michael instead associates  them, with his personal evils (i.e. Media, Tabloids). Fantastic music and  lyrics througout.<br />Is It scary starts with the same lyrics as Ghosts but  quickly moves in an entirely different direction. Jackson attacks peoples  views of him based on what a monster the tabloids have made him out to be,  but, if you seek the truth about him you'll find his true amazing self.  Very James Bond type rythem to the music.<br />The remixes are.... well  remixes. I've never enjoyed them. The don't show Jackson's true talent just  someone ability to make a dance record out of it, so don't bother with  them.<br />The rest of the album is magic, much like Jackson himself.
6304509154|5.0|In spite of its flaws (and there are a few) this is one of the greatest  horror flicks of all time.  At the same time, I find it difficult to put  Poltergeist in the same genre as other classics like Psycho and The  Exorcist.  That's because Poltergeist is really a strange blend of humor  (both blunt and subtle) and terror.  It's a mixture that seldom works (see  April Fool's Day, among others), but is orchestrated perfectly here.<br />The  film's opening scene is unforgettable, with little Carol Anne (Heather  O'Rourke) being summoned in the middle of the night by creepy, droning  voices emanating from the television.  The next 30 minutes are rather  light-hearted and jocose as we are introduced to the Freelings, a  middle-class suburban family enjoying a seemingly normal, happy life.  Yet  a threatening backdrop hovers over this little piece of Shangri-la.  As we  bear witness to several brilliant foreshadowing techniques, especially the  scenes with the clown and the tree, disquieted feelings of an impending  nightmare enter our sub-conscious.  And then, almost without warning, the  incubus reveals itself...and true hell commences.  Watch this film and  you'll see how well it plays upon some of the worst childhood fears -- have  you ever been scared of what may be hiding in your closet or under your  bed?  Those fears are likely to return after watching Poltergeist.<br />The  movie has a fine supporting cast and the special effects (by 1982  standards) are superb.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is both enchanting and  haunting at the same time.  Also pleasing to note is how the producers  managed to make a grade-A horror flick without a single character death.  I  find it difficult to make the same claim of any other &quot;horror&quot;  film made in the last 25 years.
B00000269M|5.0|I have to start by saying that I find this album better than Thriller.<br />1. Jackson wrote almost all of the album music and lyrics showing his  growing talent as a musician.<br />2. The songs all have more depth and plot  to them. Jackson is at his best when he tells stories in his music (Dirty  Diana, Smooth Criminal, Leave Me Alone)<br />3. The album is more raw, in my  opinion, because Jackson started to produce more of his own work here  getting out of the shadow of Quincy Jones.<br />4. To go along with the above  Jackson had more oppurtunity to write what he wanted, hence, more personal  songs.<br />Bad was a great stepping stone for Jackson and shows him at one of  his most prolific periods. Thiller made him a star, BAD and DANGEROUS made  him a legend and a genius.
630512065X|5.0|I found cats in the video rental section of my public library and rented  it because I was always curious about the show after seeing commercials  since I was a child. I watched it with my 5 year old daughter and was not  really impressed the first time we watched it because I was trying to  figure out the story. The second time was magic though. The music haunted  me the whole next day and my daughter fell in love with Rum Tum Tugger (as  well as myself, my mother and 2 sisters). We love all the songs as well as  watching their awesome dancing and acting. It is great entertaining fun you  wont be embarrassed to share with the rest of your family. I have bought 3  extra to give as gifts and recommend viewing it 2 times if it doesnt  particularly grab you at first.
B00000HZFH|5.0|Being a newcomer to the indie scene, i had never heard of these guys. If  someone were to ask me who they were, i would have just shrugged them off.  My first leap into the indie scene happened to be Modest Mouse's &quot;The  Moon And Antarctica&quot; (the best record in years). I figured that i  should check out the new &quot;indie kings&quot; if i dare say. I didn't  know anything about the band. I decided to go for their most recent studio  releases. BOY......why hadn't I heard of these guys before. Why isn't the  radio playing this stuff. It's definitely not mainstream, but everyone i  have played this for seems to love it. The fact is that it is very easy  listening. Keep it like a secret supplies the listener with beautiful pop  songs. Not mainstream pop rock, but very creative and catchy songs. Even if  you go for bubblegum pop or hard rock, it is safe to say that you will like  &quot;keep it like a secret&quot;.

6305537798|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie!It is so so good.I watch it at least  once a week and anyone who liked anything in the teen comedy circle will  love this cuz this one is the best! You should  just buy it because anyone  who watches this, I Promise, will become instantlly compelled.
0783225725|5.0|i had never seen this film in widescreen format. my vhs copy was never formatted to fit the screen. now that i own the dvd, i am amazed how  beautifully shot this film is, from the opening frame of the &quot;no  name&quot; gunman appearing from nowhere in the desert heat to the very  end, the movie becomes a vision of light and darkness. this film is a  western but the story line stands above any western i have seen. it is  about revenge. anyone that i have recommend this movie to are impressed  because they don't feel it is really a western but film noir. i totally  agree.
B000006YYW|5.0|I'd never have any problem of picking this album as my favourite album to  date. I bought this album in early eighties and i am still listening to it  every now and then. <br />Every track is this album is so impressive and  catchy, the sequence of the tracks are so perfectly arranged that it always  makes you to listen to the entire album once you started listening to the  first song.

0679746048|3.0|I watched the movie before I read the book, so maybe after watching the  movie and seeing everything close up in visual detail, I was disappointed  by the book's lack of detail.  Sure it had it's moments and cute tales  especially about Daisy and her chickens, Lisa and her escapades, and the  whole group going to the ice cream palor, but what it didn't have was the  complete package that the movie presented to the viewer.  Instead of  reading the emotional turmoil of the girls in the minimum security ward,  you actually witnessed it, and I found that much more compelling.  However,  I really enjoyed the chapter &quot;Mind vs. Brain&quot;, in which the  author describes in humorous detail the difference between a sane and an  insane person.  Watch the movie, and skip the book.
0780622642|3.0|I don't know, maybe it was that severe blow to the head I suffered when I was six, but something has given me a weak spot for hard luck cases- those  movies that are so terrible that I actually like them, sort of like a  good-bad movie. It's kinda hard to explain properly, like `Independence  Day', you know it was silly and contrived, but you liked it despite of  that? This is pretty much what I felt like watching this turd of a film-  about half way through it I found myself really liking it. I wasn't really  old enough to watch the original series, and it never saw much by way of  reruns, at least where I was living at the time. However, I did see  episodes later and life, and well, the movie is a distinct improvement.  They also played it straight instead of for laughs, though with a  particularly wooden William Hurt as Dr. Robinson, it wasn't much of a  stretch.<br /> Matt LeBlanc takes a welcome departure from `Friends' to  assume the role of the Jupiter II's pilot, Major Don West, a part that he  was made to play. In fact, he's probably my favorite character, even beyond  Gary Oldman's portrayal of the inept saboteur, Dr. Smith. The women of the  movie were cast by virtue of how well they appeared in tight fitting rubber  and/or spandex outfits, this of course only adds to the film's overall  visual appeal. Mimi Rogers portrays John Robinson's equally wooden wife,  Maureen, and actually comes across as a fairly extraneous character, since  it appears her only job appears to scold the men when they get out of  control. Rounding out the kid quotient of the film is Heather Graham as  Judy Robinson, who appears to be a graduate of the Robert A. Heinlein  school of women, and Lacey Chabert plays the delightfully cute n' snarky  Penny Robinson. Lastly is Jack Johnson, who plays young Will Robinson, and  it pleased me because he scored very low on the Jake Lloyd  Annoy-O-Meter.<br /> That about covers it for the cast, now for plot...<br />  Just kidding. The technology in this film is far in advance of what 2050  stuff will be like, and I had the same feeling watching this as I did with  `Event Horizon'. Anyway, the Earth has become one massive stink bomb,  because we have simply over populated and over polluted the planet to the  point where it can no longer sustain us. Not too hard to believe, really,  we're almost there now. So they conceive a plan to build a space craft that  will carry a family to a planet called Alpha Prime (don't ask me, I figured  it was Proxima Centauri), where they will build a hyperspace gateway that  will allow mass transit there by the rest of humanity so we can stink up  that planet as well. The catch is there is a terrorist faction on Earth  that wants to do all this for themselves, so they hire Dr. Smith to  sabotage the Jupiter II and its mission. He does this by reprogramming the  ships robot, (called: Robot), but is abandoned by his benefactors, stunned  unconscious and is onboard when the Jupiter II launches. Oopsee.<br />  This film has a lot of really silly moments in it, but, there is much her  to enjoy. The effects are wonderful, especially the eye-popping fly by of  the exploding Proteus star ship-a sequence that takes a full 20 seconds  from start to finish. And while the technology is too advanced, it has a  wonderful high tech look it. Though I am given to wonder what kind of moron  builds space craft with hyperdrive systems that do not allow you to plot a  destination, I am willing to overlook such flaws. This movie is fun, has  lovely visuals in both the effects and the cast. Matt LeBlanc and Gary  Oldman together make up the best parts of the cast, and their interplay is  good fun. This isn't really science fiction, rather it's SCIFI (pronounced  sciffy), but it's light and easily digestible.
0671034065|5.0|I loved this book!  I definitely read it in one sitting laughing out loud and causing everyone to continually ask me what was so funny.... I told  them they just had to read the book themselves to find out because it was  so good. <br />I did figure out the killer pretty quickly but since I usually  figure out whohasdunit way before the end of a book it wasn't a  disappointment especially since the main characters were just such fun.   The sexual tension and friendship between them was excellent.  This is a  must read for anyone who loves to laugh and loves Linda Howard books.
6301773551|5.0|The original 'Star Wars: A New Hope' had a freshness and innocence about  it that may never be recaptured again. This film broke new ground in so  many ways, movie making was never to the same. Still spectacular, it's the  greatest scif-fi adventure of all time. The 'Special Edition' version hurt  this film far more than helped it as the new parts seemed so gratuitous and  unnecessary. I just hope future generations will somehow have access to the  original 'untainted' version of Star Wars and see it in its true glory.
B00003CXGG|1.0|Jet's talents are not evident in this film. I believe that they are best  displayed with little to no special effects. the 'Matrix' style effects  used in this film were completely out of place. It also annoyed me that the  film tried to be a showcase for aaliyah or whatever her name is. BIG  LETDOWN. <br />you want good jet li fights..... buy Fist of Legend. a bruce  lee re-make that is very well done.
6303593666|5.0|Power never looked so good. With the outstanding work of Leni Riefenstahl, Triumph Of The Will is a triumph of filmmaking. The images are mesmerizing  as they showcase the might of Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler proves to be  the greatest orator in history. Though the ideology of National Socialism  and its contemporary adherents are now routinely ridiculed in most Leftist  academic circles, condemned by the Leftist media and denounced by the  general population, this great movie is testament to the power this  ideology once had and it still strikes fear into the hearts of those  viewers who oppose it. By all means, a film worth seeing.
B000000W5F|4.0|Can this album really be 20 years old? It still stands up quite well and  boasts the lead-in song, &quot;Start me Up,&quot; which is arguably in the  top five of all the Stones rockers. The opening guitar riff by Keith is  nearly as memorable as the riff which begins &quot;Satisfaction.&quot; This  album also contains one of the Stones greatest ballads, &quot;Waiting on a  Friend,&quot; a sweet, almost un-Rolling Stone-ish sounding song; wistful,  bluesy and sweet, which is a word not usually associated with this group.  (The video for this song is also the best-ever Stones video).<br />As with  most Stones albums, there are unfortunately some throw-away filler songs  here. Keith even manages to croak out a rare singing stint on &quot;Little  T and A,&quot; which is the best of the filler songs. This is an exuberant  and fun album, certainly not the last Hurrah for the Stones, but their last  really fine album.
B000007WNN|1.0|Rick Rubin, what the heck did you do?  I have heard that Beggars Banquet  has a different version of this album, before you got your hands on it.   I'm hoping so, and if anyone can find a link to that album let me know.   <br />Yes, the metalkids loved this when it came out.  As a fan of Love, to be  completely blunt I hated it.  I think this album is the litmus test for the  Cult.  If you sort-of like it but not really, then head to the back  catalog.  If you love it and think it just rocks out hard, then progress to  the forward catalog.<br />I bought this the day it came out, and was  completely disappointed. The 1 star it does get is for the fact that Love  Removal Machine is a guilty pleasure.  Put it this way, the metalkids in  Camaros loved this album.  I didn't.
B00004VW5A|5.0|What could I say more, it's the best box-set of our time. No matter what  people said. ELVIS is the one and only true King of Rock'n'Roll ( and Pop  ). If you talk about masterpiece, The King of Rock'n'Roll is the one.
B000000OSE|5.0|I have been listening to GNR since I was in kindergarten and 13 years  later they are my favorite band.Use your Illusion I is probably the best  album they put out since Appetite.the cover of Live and Let Die is one of  the best covers I've heard in my life.Don't Cry,November Rain,Garden of  Eden,and Dead Horse totally rock.Slash is a true guitar GOD!His amazing  guitar solos could be an album within themselves.I recommend this album to  anyone who truly appreciates metal.And keep hope alive, GnR will eventually  put out another album with it's original members.GnR rocks!!!!

6305265488|5.0|It is a wonderful remake of an old classic story. It's different, the  &quot;true&quot; version of the fairytale, with one horrible stepmother and  one horrible stepsister, along with one nice stepsister. Leonardo DiVincci  replaces the Fairy Godmother, and Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella AKA  Danielle.<br />It is lovely and romantic. Something for the whole family.
0553208845|5.0|Set in India, Siddhartha is subtitled an &quot;Indic Poetic Work&quot; and  clearly it does owe much to both Buddhism and Hinduism, however the  philosophy embodied in Siddhartha is both unique and quite complex, despite  the lyrically beautiful simplicity of the plot.<br />Siddhartha is one of the  names of the historical Gautama and while the life of Hesse's character  resembles that of his historical counterpart to some extent, Siddhartha is  by no means a fictional life of Buddha and his teachings.<br />Siddhartha is  divided into two parts of four and eight chapters, something some have  interpreted as an illustration of Buddhism's Four Noble Truths and the  Eightfold Path to Enlightenment.<br />Elements of Hinduism can also be found  in Siddhartha.  Some critics maintain that Hesse was influenced largely by  the Bhagavad Gita when he wrote the book and that his protagonist was  groping his way along a path outlined in that text.  Certainly the central  problems of Siddhartha and the Gita are similar:  how can the protagonist  attain a state of happiness and serenity by means of a long and arduous  path?<br />Hesse's protagonist, however, seeks his own personal path to  fulfillment, not someone else's.  It is one of trial and error and he is  only subconsciously aware of its nature.  Although many see Siddhartha's  quest as embodying the ideals of Buddhism, Siddhartha objects to the  negative aspects of Gautama's teaching.  He rejects Gautama's model for  himself and he rejects Buddhism; Siddhartha insists upon the right to  choose his own path to fulfillment.<br />The primary theme of Siddhartha is  the individual's difficult and lonely search for self-fulfillment.  Both  the means used by the hero in his quest and the nature of his fulfillment  are of prime importance and reflect recurring themes that thread their way  through all of Hesse's work.<br />Although Siddhartha listens with great  respect to the words of Buddha and does not reject Buddhism as being right  for others, he, himself, does not become Buddha's disciple, but decides to  pursue his goal through his own effort, not by following a teacher.  As in  Demian, Nietzsche's influence is apparent; the reader is strongly reminded  of Nietzsche's Zarathustra who exhorts his listeners not to follow him, but  to excel themselves.<br />Siddhartha's sense of fulfillment is a mystical one  and cannot be defined with precision.  In this respect, it resembles the  Nirvana of Buddhism.  The most important aspect of Siddhartha's growing  awareness, however, is an unselfish and undirected love.<br />The division of  the world into the two opposing poles of masculine and feminine is another  common theme in Hesse's writings.  The Father World, or masculine, is  dominated by the intellect, reason, spirit, stability and discipline; the  Mother Word, or feminine, by emotion, love, fertility, birth, death,  fluidity, nature and the senses.<br />While this symbolism is more pronounced  in other works, such as Demian and The Glass Bead Game, it is also present  and consistently developed in Siddhartha.<br />Siddhartha's position vis-a-vis  the two worlds changes during the course of the novel.  At times, he seems  to embrace one world more than the other; at other times he unites the  virtues of each.<br />Two symbolic elements thread their way through  Siddhartha; that of the river and that of a smile.  Suggestive of fluidity  as well as the paradoxical union  of permanence and flux, the river is an  age-old symbol of eternity and spiritual communion.<br />A second important  symbol in Siddhartha is that of the smile.  The characters in the story who  attain a final state of complete serenity are each characterized by a  beautiful smile reflecting a peaceful and harmonious state of being.<br />Each  of these symbols is associated with Siddhartha at key junctures in his  quest.<br />Siddhartha is written in an extremely simple style, in keeping  with the inherent simplicity of the plot, theme and general tone of the  book.  The syntax is uncomplicated and except for a few technical terms  from Indian philosophy, the vocabulary is straightforward.  Frequent use is  made of leitmotifs, parallelism and repetition and, in the original German,  the language is rhythmic and lyrical, reminiscent of a poetic religious  text with a definite meditative quality.<br />Siddhartha is told by an  omniscient third person narrator with frequent direct and indirect  quotations of the words and thoughts of various characters, especially  Siddhartha.  The narrator, almost invariably, looks at things from  Siddhartha's perspective, and even when other characters are discussed or  quoted, it is always to shed light on Siddhartha, himself.<br />A mystical and  lyrical book, Siddhartha is a beautiful story of a truly personal quest  towards the self-fulfillment we all must strive to attain.he plot, theme and general tone of the  book.

B00003CXFU|5.0|No matter what role she plays, she can always make it better. And this movie is one of them. Erin Brockovich is the out of luck, out of work woman  with two kids. She starts working at a local law firm with no experience.  When she comes onto a case that has to do with her own town's water, she  takes it with decication. Fighting coragously to win against the large  company that has destroyed the water, she shows that she is a true fighter.  <br />It's not Julia's usual romance. She has never shown so much skin or  played such a sassy role, but she does it wonderfully.
B000002O51|4.0|This is arguably Boston's greatest work!  I thought the songs on side  2  (I still refer to this album as I remember it in 1986-on vinyl) were weak  in comparison to the stellar lineup on side one.  Side one is probably one  of the best sides of music ever recorded in the rock era.  They all flow  together and seem unified.  The unification is what is lacking on side 2.   This deserves to be in any rock fan's catalog.  I had to deduct one star  for the weaker side 2, and the now dated digital drums that are played on  half the album (mostly on, you guessed it...side 2!!!)
B00000DQSS|4.0|As this was my first Kate Bush album, this album is very special to me.  <br />&quot;Never For Ever&quot; continues in the whimsical vein of  &quot;Lionheart&quot; (most evident in the cover and &quot;Egypt&quot;),  but mark a musical departure from &quot;Lionheart&quot; and &quot;The Kick  Inside&quot; with the increased use of samplers and synthesisers, enhancing  the 'whimsical' aspects of Kate's music, and adding variety to her musical  vocabulary. <br />&quot;Never For Ever&quot; is her strongest album since  &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;: Kate has shown more maturity and confidence in  this album, exploring new concepts, experimenting with different sounds,  and refining her vocals. <br />&quot;Babooshka&quot; is one of my favourite  pieces by Kate, &quot;Blow Away&quot; is an exquisitely delicate elegy, and  the dark strains of &quot;Egypt&quot; will haunt you for many nights to  come. <br />I have no intention of being objective when it comes to Kate.  She's a brilliant artist, capable of both light-hearted songs, and dark,  soul-searching symphonies. <br />The cover for this album makes me nostalgic  for a childhood long since lost - and possibly never existed. I think this  is intentional: this is Kate's swansong - the last, desperate gasp before  moving towards the infinitely more mature &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.
B000002HPT|5.0|This was the first DT album I ever heard and it was due to the  unbelievable musicianship that was created within this album that I  continued to buy DT albums, old and new. This album combines the elements  of true Progressive flavour in tracks like New Millenium and Hell's  Kitchen, but displays the bands ability to construct more popular songs  like Hollow Years and Take Away My Pain. Although a lot of people see Prog  Rock as geek music, this album is a defintite must hear/buy with its  beautiful melodies, chunky guitar riffs and intellectual, yet contempory  lyrics. GO BUY THIS ALBUM, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!
B000006MS3|4.0|Amongst diehard Kate Bush fans, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; has long been considered her best work, as opposed to the more commercially successful  &quot;Never For Ever&quot; and &quot;The Hounds of Love&quot;. <br />To an  extent I would agree with this. Kate certainly deserves credit for breaking  out of the mould of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, &quot;Lionheart&quot; and  &quot;Never For Ever&quot;. It is obvious that a deliberate attempt to  change direction has been made. The song-structures of this album are very  complex, containing layers upon layers of beautiful rich music and sampling  (prior to this, her albums consisted of drum, bass, guitar, piano and  voice, woven together with synthesisers, most evident in &quot;Never For  Ever&quot;), as well as darker imagery and concepts. <br />The complexity of  these pieces is seen in &quot;Get out of My House&quot;, with its harsh,  discordant 'metallic' percussion, interspersed with schreeches, screams,  animal noises, loops, dialogue, as well as Kate's trademark vocals. The  totality of the piece itself progresses along almost 'symphonic' lines,  building tension and depth, before reaching a conclusion which is at once  satisfying and unsettling (i.e. the two protagonists meeting on the same  level of being - in this case animalistic). <br />Further to the above, much  has been made of the darker aspects of this albums: for example, &quot;Pull  out the Pin&quot; (Just as we hit the green/ I've never been so happy to be  alive .  .  . With my silver bullet/ And my silver Buddha/ Just one thing  in it/ Me or him/ And I love life), and some of the imagery of  &quot;Houdini&quot; (I'd watch you breathe/ Bound and drowned/ And paler  than you've ever been). <br />Nevertheless, the trademark Kate Bush 'magic' is  still evident in this album. As usual, there are no 'personal' pieces: Kate  explores various concepts and emotions through characters (&quot;There Goes  a Tenner&quot; and &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot;), or through dramas  (&quot;Houdini&quot;, &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;). <br />It should also  be noted that this album doesn't have the intimacy of the previous three  albums - it's feel is somewhat distached and impersonal. <br />However, there  are some pieces on this album which simply do not work, these being  &quot;Leave It Open&quot; and &quot;All the Love&quot;. The two pieces are  rather dull, and don't achieve what I think Kate set out to achieve with  this album. <br />At the risk of sounding like a Space Cadet, another aspect  of this album is worth mentioning. It has been remarked to me on several  occasions that this album ranks alongside Coil's &quot;Love's Secret  Domain&quot; and &quot;The Omen&quot; and &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;  soundtracks as the most 'haunted' albums. Or, less poetically and more  specifically, that this album seems to act as a conduit for various  psychic/acausal energies. Since buying this album a few weeks ago, I have  experiences such things as strange dreams, discarnate voices,  synchronicity, etc. John Balance, of the brilliant English band Coil,  stated in an interview with &quot;The Wire&quot; that he and Kate Bush were  sharing the same psychic spaces, as well as other interesting comments.  http:/brainwashed.com/coil<br />For me, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; remains my  favourite Kate Bush album, with &quot;The Dreaming&quot; tied with  &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; for a close second.
6304288433|4.0|In some ways, Halloween 2 is original. Instead of fast-forwarding one  year, it picks up right where the original left off. It maintains the  original cast and adds more to the story instead of simply rehashing the  story from the original. In many ways, however... it falters. The star,  Jamie Lee Curtis, is reduced to crawling around and murmuring like a stroke  victim. Donald Pleasence often shouts the exact same speeches he shouted in  the first movie and the new actor portraying Michael Mysers doesn't look AT  ALL like the actor who played him in part 1. Whoo! Those faults aside,  Halloween 2 does deliver the goods. Characters aren't lined up one by one  and knocked off like in most horror movies. They are slowly and  methodically bumped off in rather memorable ways without disturbing the  slowly building suspense. The ending, by the way, is a knock-out. If the  series would have ended here I would have been greatly pleased. It  didn't... and because of that fact (and that fact alone) Halloween 2 does  feel a little dated. But make no doubt about it, this is as good as horror  sequels get.
B000002UAX|5.0|One of the greatest albums The Beatles ever made. ( Together with Revolver, Abbey Road and Sgt.Pepper ) On this album you will find music in  many different categories. From hard rock songs to sweet, tender ballads to  cabaret songs and country.<br />The album starts with the good upbeat song  &quot;Back In The USSR&quot; (McCartney) which is a flying beginning. The  two next songs, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; and &quot;Glass Onion&quot; (Both  by John Lennon) are two nice songs. (Love the bass in Dear Prudence).  &quot;ObLaDiObLaDa&quot; is classic. One of the best &quot;upbeat&quot;  songs ever made. Many will say that &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot; is a waste,  but seen in a connection with &quot;Honey Pie&quot; it makes sence.  &quot;The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill&quot; (Lennon) has a good  melody and a great drive. Classic Lennon. Again with a outstanding bass.  Harrison's  &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps &quot; is majestetic. One of  the greatest songs on the album. &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot;, by  John Lennon is a typical protest song, influenced by Bob Dylan. Really  good. &quot;Martha My Dear&quot; is one of my favourites on this album.  Paul McCartney, who I think is the best songwriter of the 20th century( In  tough competition with Lennon and some others), creates a sound which I  find unique. Fabulous music. After the optimistic &quot;Martha My  Dear&quot;, the pessimist John Lennon give us the great &quot;I'm So  Tired&quot;. &quot;Blacbird&quot; is a very good ballad by Paul McCartney.  Nice ballad. &quot;Piggies&quot; is a underrated song by George Harrison.   The melody is very good, but the pig sounds, which I suppose should be  cool, is a little drawback. &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; is a new brilliant  tune by Paul McCartney. This time he makes a country song mixed with a  great pop melody. The result is very, very good. &quot;Don't Pass My  By&quot; (Starr) is also a country inspired song, but has not the great  melody line as &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;. &quot;Why Don't We Do It On The  Road&quot; is actually a nice soul melody, if you ask me. &quot;I Will  &quot; is a beautiful and soft lovesong by Paul McCartney. One of my  favourites on this album. &quot;Julia&quot; belong in the same category,  but John Lennon's song about his mother isn't in the same class. But still  great.<br />Side two gets off with the nice upbeat &quot;Birthday&quot;  (McCartney). I'm not a blues fan, so Lennon's &quot;Yer Blues&quot; is not  of my favourites. Still good for those who are into blues. McCartney's  &quot;Mother Nature's Song&quot; is a mix between a soft folk song and  McCartney's scent for beautiful ballads. Very tasteful. John Lennon's  &quot;Everybody Got Something...&quot;  is a average song, but his  &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; is very good. (Extremely good intro). &quot;Helter  Skelter&quot; by McCartney is a nice contrast to all his ballads. That is  what make &quot;The White Album&quot; so special. It's also a good hard  rock song. &quot;Long Long Long&quot; is George Harrison's reaction to the  India trip and his meditation. A soft song which is suitable after  &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. &quot;Revolution 1&quot; is another great  protest song by John Lennon. &quot;Honey Pie&quot; shows that Paul  McCartney also manage the cabaret and entertainment music. &quot;Savoy  Truffle&quot;, by George Harrison is a cool song. &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;  is John Lennon's best song on this album. A very good song.  &quot;Revolution 9&quot; is just sound, but sound sat in system.  &quot;Goodnight&quot;, by Ringo Starr is a nice end to this absolutley  brilliant music journey.
158234082X|5.0|I fought with my wife while reading this book, over who got to read it  each night. We kept alternating, and eventually finished it a couple hours  apart. We both *loved* this book.<br />The story the author tells is  frequently funny, sometimes very funny. I suffered from out-of-control  laughing at one point in the book, at a story that still brings chuckles to  my day.<br />It's also a great book for aspiring home cooks; one chapter, How  to Cook Like the Pros, is worth the price of the book all by itself.  There's nothing revolutionary in the chapter, but there's no hype or  dishonesty, either. Bourdain tells you want you need, what you don't need,  and how paying attention to the details makes a huge difference. We saved  the cost of the book, and then some, by buying a different set of cookware  for the kitchen. No lie!<br />Most of all, this is a book by someone who loves  food, and loves cooking in restaurants. His stories are honest, if not  always flattering. Frankly, I don't know that Bourdain is a very nice  person...but I can't wait to eat at his restaurant.
6305910103|5.0|I'm a proud Baby Boomer, a fan of Star Trek from its inception.  The  originals were &quot;must see&quot; events.  When I was in grad school in  Baltimore reruns could be seen on the cable from DC, B'more &amp;  Philadelphia.  I'm not a &quot;reviewer&quot; but I know that while I watch  Star Trek II, III, IV, etc. (I am awaiting the release of Star Trek: The  Motion Picture so that my collection will be completed.) my proefessional  problems fade into a time warp and all is right with the cosmos.  Escapism,  from time to time, is a vital part of mental health.
0671015206|3.0|The title is the best part of book.  Using lots of tables and statistics, the book describes a group of millionaires who do not act like  millionaires.  This makes it somewhat dry and dull, with many facts  repeated in different parts of the book.  The bent is towards extremely  frugal individuals.  I think it spends too much time on people that make  $50,000 a year but cut every corner to accumulate wealth.  I never find out  why they stash away all their money, it never seems to be enjoyed?   I  question the logic of saving every penny until you die just to boast that  your net worth is over a million dollars.<br />I read Rich Dad, Poor Dad and  found it much more compelling.  It offers a practical approach to making  money work for you.
B00003CXFV|3.0|If you've been fascinated with movies like The Firm involving legal dramas, Erin Brockovich will be amusing at best. It's worth it for Julia  Roberts and some witty punchlines, but it left me wanting to know more  about the other characters and their futures. It was a pity that all the  characters seemed to be rather thin and not too bright, but the plot could  have been probable even if they had been made a little smarter.
0446677450|5.0|I read the book in one day and was amazed at how much information was in  there.  The author does not mandate strict ways to become financially  independent, rather he offers up some basic financial knowledge, gives you  a road map and then lets you decide.  An extensive recommended reading list  provides a springboard to move forward.  If this were required reading for  high-school seniors, we would have a lot more wealthy people, regardless of  what their income is.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Take everything you know about your life and imagine that you are going to have an incredible wake-up call in under 2 hours. The characters are human  and honest even in their most distressing moments. As much as I adore Mena  Suvari, her acting performance wasn't nearly as stellar as Kevin Spacey's.  'American Beauty' may or may not have the typical Hollywood ending, but the  hidden message is one of those deep, powerful things that will stay in your  mind for days.
6305807086|5.0|Craig Schwartz (played by actor John Cusack) has a problem: he doesn't like being Craig Schwartz.  This identity crisis is identified (pun  intended) immediately within the beautiful establishing shot(s) of director  Spike Jonze's fantastic -- if not highly bizarre -- film &quot;Being John  Malkovich.&quot;  In the aforementioned shot(s) we see a puppet show taking  place -- a solitary performance, which is orchestrated and conducted by  Schwartz, with no audience in attendance and (presumably) with no other  purpose than providing him with a mode of escape: from himself, from his  life... from reality.  &quot;The grass is always greener on the other side of  the fence&quot; proves to be the running theme (or should I say  &quot;belief?&quot;) for all the characters in the movie (including  Schwartz), each seeking a new and improved existence -- specifically via a  magical portal that allows them to enter the mind of acclaimed American  actor John Malkovich.  But once the transition is made, and each character  has a chance to &quot;be&quot; somebody else-to experience the hoped -- for  improved emerald splendor of another's grass -- Spike Jonze throws a wicked  curveball at the audience, asking the question &quot;Is it really greener  elsewhere?&quot;<br />For me, this ingenious film worked on many levels.   Firstly, the technical aspects, from lighting to camera angles, and  everything in between, were handled and produced in a very controlled and  (I think) appropriate fashion for the message being conveyed.  An example  of this can be found in the choices of lighting for the scenes involving  Schwartz.  He's a man who has grown despondent with his life, so Jonze  chooses to light him in a gloomy, almost haze-like manner, conveying a  sense of doom and depression, as well as depicting a gloomy and futile  attempt by Schwartz to struggle through the suffocating miasma that  surrounds him every day.  It is not until we see Schwartz manipulating his  puppets, or until he enters the mind of Malkovich (essentially, in both  cases, &quot;becoming&quot; someone or something else), that we see a  brighter, more illuminating style of lighting used, which seems to indicate  Schwartz only feels alive and free when he is able to escape from himself.   This clever handling of the lighting shows the audience -- with or without  the assistance of related dialogue -- what kind of life Schwartz lives, and  gives definite clues to his personality and his motivation (or lack  thereof).<br />On the emotional and psychological levels, I found &quot;Being  John Malkovich&quot; to be extremely satisfying.  Not only was the  quirkiness of its subject matter both challenging and refreshing (I mean, a  magic portal into the mind of John Malkovich, for Pete's sake!), but the  underlying questions being asked, as well, made this a pleasurable viewing  experience.  I left the movie wondering about my own existence, and about  the times I -- like everyone else, I'm sure -- have considered what it  would be like to be someone else; to see the world through another's eyes.   The answer, I believe (and the movie provides this quite clearly), is that  a person can never really know what it's like be someone else without  completely becoming that other person.  And once you do, what's the point?   You've lost yourself and will never know the differences you are now  experiencing.  Spike Jonze meets Soren Keirkegaard: I like it!
6305718954|4.0|Wow. Even for being a non-Christian/Catholic, the premise behind  'Stigmata' is riveting. Take a cornerstone philosophic idea on theism and  expand it broad enough to cover almost any religion, and you have the  concept portrayed in this movie. A must-see for anyone interested in the  multiple paths to God.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I love when these movies that look childish come out and are more or less  aimed at an older viewing audience.  This DVD is served to be a classic in  your collection of other movies.  The quest was simple, save an alien  planet from destruction, but it turned much worse when they pick  out-of-work actors and actresses from a show called StarQuest.  Trying to  help the aliens out, they come upon many bluders and faults in there search  for victory.  Not only does the cast really bring this movie alive, the  special effects and comedy really keep you up and interested.  Comedy is a  big portion of this movie and it really keeps comming at you, if your  observant, you'll notice many little things happening in the background as  a scene is going on.  This movie is creative no the less and should be  viewed by all, even the kids.  So huddle up and pop in this disc, because  it just might become a family favorite.
B0000004V2|5.0|I had heard many great things about this album by a group I had never  heard of before. I had delayed buying it for a long time for no reason.  Then, I finally decided to but it. At first listen I didn't know what to  think. I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. I could tell songs like She  Bangs The Drums, Bye Bye Badman, Sugar Spun Sister and Made of Stone  equaled the hype I had heard. But alot of the album sounded like noise. I  decided to listen again. This time I payed much more attention. I soon  realized that The Stone Roses was even more incredible than I had Heard. It  remains one of my favorite albums. Buy it.
B00003CX5A|5.0|From the creator Tim Burton, you should know that this movie is going to  be odd.  The Classic tail of Sleepy Hollow has been retold in this new  updated look at a favorite ghost tale.  With a great cast and a great  story, the movie really comes to life, or should I say, it rolls some  heads?  AHAHA..sorry.  The special effects in the movie are awesome and the  color of the town really makes an atmosphere of death, just how good can  Tim Burton get.  With many turns and twists and a murder here and there,  you won't sleep at this epic movie.  You'll find yourself looking for clues  and maybe even scream for a little bit.  But I can only say that you'll  love this movie, it has so much to offer and can appeal to most people,  even the love story type of people (yuck).  Rent it and if you like it, buy  it.
B000002LCX|5.0|Strangeways, Here We Come is the Smiths farewell album. It is to say the  least, a graceful bow down. Although it does not equal the brilliance of  The Queen Is Dead, it is just as good as any other Smiths album. A Rush And  A Push, Girlfriend In A Coma, Unhappy Birthday, and I Won't Share You  remain some of the best songs they have ever done. This album is very  essential to fans of The Smiths.

B0000024K1|5.0|As a sequel to 'Bum rush', noone perhaps expected the impact that P.E. would have upon not just hip hop, but practically all music genres of the  late eighties. And not stopping there, as the initial intro to the album  suggested, sirens wailing, the revolution was maybe not televised, but P.E  and the SW1s' ripped it up where ever they played, globally, with even the  NME posing the question as to whether P.E. were the greatest rock n roll  band ever. From the evidence of this album, harnessing the ever increasing  pace of the hip hop revolution and exploding it into the anadyne,  stagnating music scene of the late eighties, reaching into practically all  corners of the industry and across the spectrum cultures, Chuck D, Flavor  Flav and Terminator X had concocted the ultimate timebomb, with an  immediate and lasting effect. Retrospective hyperbole aside, this truly was  an album which would capture its intended audience and further afield,  potent messages and wicked metaphor poured over the funk of the bomb squad,  with the surreal talent of Flavor and militant, unstable rhetoric of  Proffesor Griff combining with the best DJ talent in hip hop to create a  molotov cocktail. With samples from Slayer, the precursor of a symbois with  some other rock group on Bring the Noise, the truly seminal Bassheads,  Black steel and bazookas, and the drum track Maddonna teefed for justify my  love, this album was enough to imprint the culture of enquiry, questioning  and funk into those that heard it, and those who chose not to... it caught  you pissin in your pants. For once, believe the hype, it defined the  century for a generation and truly gave us a basis for fighting the power.  <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0060931671|2.0|Whose Conspiracy is it?<br /> In The Crying of Lot 49, Pynchon seems to be trying to spoof the conspiracy-theory story, but I believe he fails to  write a convincing story because there are no believable characters moving  the plot. <br /> Ever since I started high school in 1952 I have been  aware that individuals have descried and the media have described grand  theories of covert conspiracies at all levels of our society. In my  earliest recollections it was the \\"dirty pinko commies\\" who had infiltrated  Hollywood, the Army, and all levels of the U.S. Government and \\"they\\" were  determined to destroy our Judeo-Christian-military-industrial society. When  I started college in the early sixties, the hot conspiracy was the work of  the rabble rousers trying to subvert the status quo among the minorities  and women. After the Kennedys and M. L. King were assassinated, wonderfully  chilling, probing novels, TV documentaries, dramas, and fantastic movies  promoting a vast array of conspiracy theories were produced. Modern America  has been primed to expect a conspiracy in any place or at any time as a  part of our partisan political process. We love a good conspiracy-theory  story.<br /> As an engineer who lived in Southern California in the  sixties and worked a few years for a small electronics company that made  subassemblies that wound up on the moon, I could identify with the poor  slobs who worked for Yoyodyne. As a stamp collector, the name \\"Thurn and  Taxis\\" sounded very familiar. As an avid reader of the plays of the  Seventeenth Century, I could identify most of the scenes in the Courier's  Tragedy. As a fan of David Lodge, I smiled at the allusion to Morris Zapf.  All of Pynchon's characters range from oddball to extreme stereotypes, and  the plot unfolds driven by an extremely long series of tedious coincidences  that drive Oedipa through an improbable quest that ends at an auction. <br />  What bothered me was that Pynchon has Oedipa jump to a conclusion that  there is a conspiracy early in the plot and then she sets out on a liminal  quest and builds a hermeneutic conspiracy theory which the author presents  in as realistically detailed a fashion as Dreiser does in An American  Tragedy. Granted Pynchon follows the postmodernist formula of introducing a  wide ranging pastiche of clues, provided by widely different, mostly  unreliable, repressed to paranoid characters, but they all reinforce in  Oedipa's mind that there is a rational conspiracy that has existed for  almost three hundred years, which has the effect of being a substitute  religious experience and post office for the usual outcasts of society. <br />  There were many warm smiles along the way, but the relentless sledge  hammering of the mindless, paranoid clues Oedipa follows wore me down.  Satire needs a believable, naïve straight man, or woman, to carry the story  line. Ode didn't do it for me.<br />I rate the book two and a half stars.

I can't stand to hear her voice! It makes me shudder. Why do people  like this stuff? She sounds like she's choking or something! She's so fake!  Don't waste your money on this CD unless, of course, you liked 'Lucky' and  'Oops...I Did It Again' because the rest of the songs are just like those  two.
B00000427L|4.0|These are all very fine perfomances by Ashkenazy and Previn.  There also  aren't any problems with the sound to my ear and in fact I really like the  particular sound of Ashkenazy's piano in this recording.  The only drawback  lays in the 2nd and 3rd concerti, which, while perfectly played, lack the  spontaneity and passion of other recordings.  I'd take Argerich any day  over Ashkenazy in the 3rd.  Also of note, Askenazy chooses the slower,  chordal cadenza in the 3rd, which suits his interpretation well but  detracts from the concerto's overall charm.  This cd was my first classical  cd and it's a great place to start with Rachmaninov.  These performancse  aren't definitive, but are still excellent and come at a good price.
B00004XMVL|5.0|Nothing like it! This movie was really scary. A great &quot;chick&quot; movie, it wil have her holding on tight!.  All the main characters were  intresting beyond belief, I suggest a trip to the official web site too  before going to see it.
158234082X|1.0|This book is very boring. Every scandalous tidbit you are expecting is already in the promos, so you needn't bother with this. He actually has a  page of curse words used in the kitchen - and their definitions. Yeah, with  40 pages left I decided not to waste any more time.
0920236820|5.0|Yes this is a very good example of how a little girl outsmarts a huge  dangerous dragon.  Even though the princess could have just let the prince  try to make it out on his own, but she didn't she used her smarts and with  that she got the best of the dragon.  Without violence, she was able to  make it through a situation and no one was hurt.  This book get two thumbs  up, and a BRAVO!
0671004611|4.0|The late Col. Philip J. Corso outlines how extraterrestrial technology,  secured from the site of the Roswell, New Mexico, crash of 1947, was  literally spoon-fed almost insidiouly to U.S. industries at no cost over a  carefully planned course of time. According to the book, many of the  products and much of the technology we use today are a direct result of the  reverse-engineering of materials found at the site of the crash. There has  been some skepticism regarding Col. Corso's story, but consider the fact  that he spends very little time in this book discussing the actual sequence  of events stemming from the crash (although his account of the crash scene  itself will leave the reader with vivid images of what happened). Instead,  he focuses on the red tape and bureaucracy that he and his colleagues faced  in the planning and transfer of information to industries. Not as  fast-moving and/or action-packed as the title suggests, but generally very  interesting. Col. Corso died suddenly and mysteriously of a second heart  attack in 1998.
B0000296SI|4.0|this cd is great. i loved it because it is different than most music iv'e  heard. you at least have to listen to it. the name doesn't describe the cd  at all
B00004TR2G|2.0|...to hold all the disappointed souls who buy this version of JAWS.   <br />When I first heard that they were going to give us previously unreleased  music from JAWS, my heart raced.  JAWS was the first soundtrack I ever  bought -- I practically wore the grooves out of the LP from the day I  bought it.  Even back then, though, it's always disturbed me that it was a  measly 34 minutes long when there was obviously much more music created for  the film.  Granted, there were running-time restrictions on vinyl, but  couldn't they have included more of John Williams wonderful score?  Then  when it hit CD, I was hoping they'd release the additional music, but it  wasn't to be... until now.  Sort of.  <br />While it's great to hear  &quot;missing&quot; music tracks from the film such as &quot;Father and  Son,&quot; they really dropped the ball by giving us &quot;original  recording session&quot; music in lieu of the actual score used in the film.   This new stuff (and even the remakes of the original tracks) sounds tinny,  and has none of the warmth nor richness of the originally released  soundtrack. It harkens back to those K-Tel recordings by &quot;The Sound  Effects.&quot; With some tracks, the difference is painfully obvious, such  as &quot;Montage&quot; (&quot;Tourists on the Menu&quot; on the original  album) which not only sounds like a high school marching band  interpretation of the score, but is over a minute SHORTER here.  What's the  point of including extra music if you're going to severely edit the  existing tracks?!  <br />This may be Williams fully-sanctioned version of the  material, but a real disservice was done by giving us alternate recordings  instead of the originals.  All in all I found this VERY disappointing, and  will be returning my copy for a full refund...
B00003CXGG|4.0|I'm a big Jet Li fan, and I like the music of Aaliyah, so I had to own &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;, this is Li's first starring role in a movie and his second American movie. Li plays Han Sing who escapes a Hong Kong prison to avenge the death of his younger brother in America. The fight scenes, though nothing compared to his Hong Kong movies, wasn't bad, better than most American martial arts films. If you want to see Jet Li at his best, I recommend &quot;Fist of Legend&quot;, &quot;The Taichi Master&quot;, &quot;The Swordsman II&quot;, &quot;Once Upon A Time In China I, II, III&quot;, &quot;The Bodyguard From Beijing&quot;, and &quot;Fong Sai Yuk I &amp; II&quot;. I was pleased to see Russell Wong in this movie, I liked his mini series &quot;Vanishing Son&quot; and his small, but memorable role in &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;. I was a bit disappointed that Wong didn't have a bigger role in &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;. I hope Jet Li would make more films in America, hopefully with various soundtracks, and more intense fight scenes. With her first and last starring role, I thought that r&amp;b beauty Aaliyah played Trish O'Day superbly and I was saddened to hear of her death in the Bahamas. Rest in peace Aaliyah.
B000023VR6|5.0|Let me just say that this is a great CD,with great songs.I think that they should have dropped the interludes.I think that they just put that on there  to take up space.And they aren't even funny.Anyway,the best songs on here  are &quot;Still Dre&quot;,&quot;Forgot About Dre&quot;,&quot;Next  Episode&quot;,&quot;Whats the  difference&quot;,&quot;Explosive&quot;,and&quot;Some LA Niggaz&quot;.If you  like gangsta rap you should get this.
B0000024UX|5.0|This has got to be one of the Classic Albums of all times, it was in the  Charts 23wks at no.1 &amp; an amazing 303wks in the Charts all told, &amp;  if you listen to the tracks on it you will see (or rather hear) why. This  Album topped all S&amp; G`s previous ones &amp; couldn`t be bettered &amp;  eventually S&amp; G ended up going their separate ways. There is of course  the brilliant title song (my fave.) sang beautifully by Art. The lively  catchy Cecelia, about a heartbroken young man who discovers his girlfriend  is being unfaithful to him. The haunting  The only Living Boy In New York,  &amp; Bye Bye Love, a good cover version originally sang by The Everley  Bros. there`s The Boxer, a very well written song which apparently took a  very long time to record. 2 other tracks, El Conder Pasa &amp; Song For The  Asking, are also worth a listen. This is definatley a  C.D. to add to your  collection. A real masterpiece of an album.
0425107469|5.0|If you don't read any other book by DK, then this must be the one you  choose. You cannot help but fall in love with the main character (the GOOD  DOG) and just wish you could have one of your own. There is drama, action,  the &quot;good vs. evil&quot; conflict, everything you could ask from a  wonderful story. This book alone, will make you a fan.

0783114222|5.0|First off, if I could give this miniseries 10, 20, a zillion stars, I would.  Amazon just didn't let me count high enough.<br />So let me get ahold  of myself long enough to tell you to run, run, run and get this DVD set  now, if you haven't already.  &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; is one  of the most unique and engrossing (as well as gorgeously produced)  miniseries I've ever seen -- 12 hours of moving, dramatic, gripping,  frightening, and ultimately completely inspiring entertainment.  As a kid  born in the late sixties, I missed the moon race (and I'm still ticked  about it).  But this literally perfect 12-episode miniseries makes me feel  as if I've been there too -- from the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the triumphs  and near-misses of the ensuing missions, to the vastly underappreciated  final Apollo 16 and 17 missions. (As one character in the film laments,  &quot;We stopped going up just when we were getting really good at  it.&quot;)<br />Those of you who might have avoided this because it's  &quot;history&quot; -- let me reassure you right now that it's as gripping  as any drama you'll see in or out of a theatre.  This isn't just history  painstakingly created by some of those who were there -- it's also just  plain incredible, suspenseful, joyful entertainment.<br />And for those of  you who saw it on HBO, the DVD set is well worth the price, even if you'd  already taped it. The DVD set offers not only crystal-clear viewing you'd  expect (and the special effects hold up admirably under the discerning eye  offered through DVD), but also special features including an enjoyable  making-of featurette (emphasizing Tom Hanks' huge role in bringing the  project to the screen), plus behind-the-scenes studies of special effects,  3D ship models (which can be rotated or even viewed in wireframe), a  transcript of Kennedy's &quot;We Choose to go to the Moon&quot; speech, a  follow-up quiz, and a virtual tour of the solar system.  And that's just  for starters.<br />The writing, acting, music, direction and more are all  simply superb -- each hour out of the twelve having its own particular look  and feel, while nevertheless meshing perfectly with the others. The  introductions to each chapter in Apollo history are delivered quietly, but  with eloquence and power, by the project's producer, co-writer, actor (and  driving force) Tom Hanks.<br />One of my favorite aspects of the project was  the way it brought in so many actors who are often underused (or at least  under-appreciated) in TV and film today -- many of whom are cast against  type to show what they can really do.  Stephen Root, a guy I'd loved as  Jimmy James on NewsRadio for years, does a terrific job in a serious role  as Mission Control's Chris Kraft, as does Nick Searcy in a quiet and often  sensitive turn as the program's father figure Deke Slayton.  Meanwhile,  Stephen Root's former NewsRadio news director Dave Foley also gets in on  the action, and gets to shed his &quot;Kids in the Hall&quot; cynicism with  a surprisingly sweet and innocent portrayal of Al Bean.<br />Other favorites  out of the dozens of amazing actors include Ted Levine's wistful, complex  (not to mention curmudgeonly) Alan Shepard, the criminally underused Jo  Anderson's sensitive and moving Pat White (wife of Gemini and Apollo I  astronaut Ed White), and memorable appearances large and small by such  gifted folks as Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Matt Craven, Tim Daly,  Mark Harmon (returning for a few moments to his lighter roots), Paul  McCrane, David Clennon, James Rebhorn, Mark Rolston, Jay Mohr, George  Newbern, Brett Cullen and Steve Zahn.<br />The surprises are the best part.  Before viewing this, I would never have guessed that the Apollo 13  (&quot;We interrupt this Program&quot;) segment, while unique and powerful,  would be my least favorite of the group, while &quot;Spider,&quot; a look  at the development of a *machine*, for goodness' sake, would move me to  tears.  Otherstandouts (keeping in mind that they're all terrific) include  a quietly powerful look at Apollo I, the trials and surprising fates of the  astronauts' wives in an episode directed by Sally Field, and the  bittersweet old-man-as-underdog battle of Alan Shepard to make it &quot;up  there&quot; one last time -- and for more than 15 minutes.<br />OK, I'll shut  up.  But if you ever have a day when you've encountered a really stupid  driver, or been detained in ridiculous meetings with half-brained bozos, or  wondered if human beings aren't actually DE-volving -- then this miniseries  is just the kind of thing to remind you of what human beings can be at  their very best. And what wonders they are capable of.<br />And I can't  believe I missed it all.  We just better go back.  Darn it.<br />NOTE: For  those of you inspired by the miniseries, I strongly urge you to go pick up  Andrew Chaikin's wonderful &quot;A Man on the Moon,&quot; the history of  Apollo that provided much of the backbone for the miniseries.  And for an  even closer look at the moon, don't miss &quot;Full Moon&quot; (Michael  Light and Andrew Chaikin) -- a truly stunning, beautiful, even eerie  compilation of lunar photographs, many of which had never before been seen.er standouts (keeping in mind that they're all terrific) include  a quietly powerful look at Apollo I, the trials and surprising fates of the  astronauts' wives in an episode directed by Sally Field, and the  bittersweet old-man-as-underdog battle of Alan Shepard to make it &quot;up  there&quot; one last time -- and for more than 15 minutes.<br />OK, I'll shut  up.

B000007MVX|5.0|Despite being a bit of a metal head over the years it has always amazed me  how I return to this album for inspiration, such is it's quality. When you  listen to it in it's entirity (whilst generally bouncing, preening and  throwing the obligatary shapes) then you'll see what I mean.<br />Of course,  some may find it long-winded whilst others may not be able connect with A  Passion Play's unique mood - fair enough. After all, hare did have a spare  pair.......
B00003CX95|5.0|A movie that can be viewed countless times.  Great drama, action and comedy.  The scenery is stunning and the performances are of an all-star  caliber.
630587493X|5.0|I rented this DVD with the expectation that it would be the  &quot;typical&quot; Robin Williams movie. I knew that the movie had been  panned by some critics and did poorly at the box office, so I wasn't  expecting much. Half way through the movie I actually paused it and turned  to my wife and asked her: &quot;were the critics watching the same  movie?&quot; This ended up being an incredibly thoughtful film, deep on  many levels. In my opinion this was a film that suffered from poor  marketing. The TV trailers implied a comedy, when in fact it is a thought  provoking film. Transfer is excellent.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|As a 007 fan I hate this movie. It is incredibly boring. And, since it isn't an official Bond movie, it doesn't have the music, the gunbarrel  opening, and the usually Q, M, and Monetpenny. Even if you are a 007 fan  there is no point in even seeing this movie.
B00001NFCY|1.0|I honestly cannot fathom how somebody could listen to this CD and actually  want to listen to it a second time.  I'm sorry but it's just so *DULL*.   When will these incessant post-grunge/mainstream rock groups END?!  Do  people actually hear a difference between Creed and Third Eye Blind?  I  sure don't.  Every song I'm nearly convinced this is actually Eddie Vedder  singing.  I realize he can't change his voice but that's not the only thing  they borrow from Pearl Jam.  The songs range from stagnant to simply  annoying (&quot;What If&quot;).  The lyrics, which are supposed to be  &quot;deep&quot; or something, come off and pretentious.  To readers - do  humanity a favor and don't buy this album.  To Creed - quit flogging a dead  genre!
B000006ZL4|5.0|This cd has no flaws in any sense,if you like any sort of metal, from  Malmsteem to Maiden,Buy this cd now! the music is very elaborate with many  classic elements and the sound is simply flawless,every instrument is  recorded perfectly. this is one rare case of a perfect work of art. the  singer is one of the best of the genre,clean and powerfull voice,which uses  some green at all the right times. the keyboards are also truly  brilliant,even the bass carries a notoriously  excellent pressence here.  needless to say that the guitars display great virtuosity aswell,and the  drums are also great. mainly this is a very powerfull and greatly  elaborated album,the lirics carry a poetic feel to them and you get a sort  of mythological feel with some &quot;castelvania&quot; like touches to it.  you should buy this now, what are you waitting for?
B0000024K1|5.0|If one album had to be chosen in each genre to put in a time capsule, you  would have to be insane not to put this in there.  ITANOMTHUB is without a  doubt one of the best put together, most influential CDs recorded.  Chuck D  is an incredibly powerful rapper, yet is not overshadowed by the incredibly  powerful lyrics he raps.  The album is full of [surprisingly] experimental  sounds.  The lyrics are bitter and meaningful.  Forget these joke groups  like DMX and Jay-Z, go buy something with some meaning and originality.
006100166X|5.0|This book's hero is quite different from the bored, sophisticated older  man that Heyer usually casts in that role. Instead, &quot;Sherry&quot; is a  gentleman in his early twenties who must marry to take control of his  fortune from his unscrupulous uncle. When his current infatuation rejects  his proposal, Sherry, miffed, finds a childhood friend in the village (Hero  Wantage, &quot;not quite seventeen&quot;) and marries her instead. Sherry's  close friends all play a major role in the story and are admirably drawn,  as are the hero and heroine. There are plenty of comic moments, the romance  is quite believably developed, and I found myself laughing aloud more than  once at the scrapes Hero keeps getting herself into. This is Ms. Heyer at  her very best, and an excellent first-time pick for those Regency readers  who wonder what all the fuss is about this grande dame of period romance.
0140177396|5.0|The book 'Of Mice &amp; Men' is what people should read to understand the  situation that the habitants of this small world is suffering: loneliness,  violence, love that take people to the death. An authentic book, which many  could predict to be bad, but that could be the best of it. Full of  surprises, sadness that you will never experience with bunch of papers, the  cruelty of love, and the unpredictable final. And questions, millions of  questions coming out each seconds from your head, that would not stop even  after you've finished the book: Why? What for? Was it the right decision?  Didn't he have enough ways to advance? A book that could reach the top. And  this, is what I call a book.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is one of the few great rappers of our time. He is original in his  lyrics and this is very refreshing. He raps about what he is feeling and  doesn't care what anyone says about it. Although no one wants to admit it,  everyone has felt like him at one time or another. He, and only he, has the  balls to say it out loud and I respect him for that.

B000002L5P|5.0|The Smiths's debut is a stunning album which would show what was to come  from an amazing band. Morrissey's lyrics longing for love and trouble with  the past with Marr's delicate to fast paced music. The opening track  &quot;Reel Around The Fountain&quot; was the song that won me over to The  Smiths. Its touching lyrics and music. It shows how beautiful a song can be  without having a fancy production. The album goes from slow love songs to  fast angry songs. &quot;You've Got Everything Now&quot; a song about a past  friendship to the sweet &quot;The Hand That Rocks The Cradle&quot;. The  album has a differnt mix of The Smiths's 7&quot; classic &quot;Hand In  Glove&quot;. The album ends in a blaze with the powerful &quot;Suffer  Little Childern&quot;. Its about a tough issue but has good music to be  back it up and a haunting voice echo  effect that adds to the subject  content.

0440180295|4.0|This was a fun indoctrination to Vonnegut's work. Much to think about in this one: the meaning behind &quot;So it goes,&quot; whether Billy Pilgrim  is sane or insane, and how literal was the story in its idea of Billy's  time travelling? The movie changes some parts, and leaves some other good  points out, but both are worth checking out to complement each other. Great  novel about a forgotten event in the history of World War II.

0393312836|5.0|Boy, that Burgess has some nerve!  First, he gets us to like this ultraviolent teenager due to the fun narration, then he encourages us to  feel sorry for him when Big Government intervenes and prevents him from  acting as he would wish!  Outstanding story and language...just one thing,  couldn't Burgess have left the final chapter out, as Stanley Kubrick did in  the film? I love how the final made me wonder about Alex, where the novel  tried to make amends.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a beautiful film. The is easily one of my favorite animes. This is must-ave for any anime fan or even for new comers into the  genre. The film's story is never confusing (which unfortunatly some anime's  have that reputation of being over confusing and a little to  &quot;artsy&quot;). The movie's interesting characters and story continue  to entertain the audience throughout the film. The film was dubbed quite  nicely from its japanese counterpart, well known actors consist of Gillian  Anderson, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, CLaire Danes, Billy Bob Thorton, and  Jada Pinkett Smith. But where the film truely shines is the animation.  Whith its lush backgrounds and original character art its reall a treat on  the eyes. This personally is one of my favorite anime's, and I highly  recommend this to anime fans and new comers alike!
B00004VWA7|5.0|For anyone in Jazz band who ever played &quot;Birdland&quot;, you need to pay homage to Jaco, the bassist who helped create teh jazz fusion rage of the 70's. This album shows his eclectic and diverse tastes in music &amp;  composition. The remasters make the clarity even better, and two new tracks  make it worth the money. BUY THIS DISC...
0670880728|5.0|My friend from England recommended this book over a year ago and it wasn't  until two weeks ago that I picked it up.  I only regret not reading it  sooner.  It's the kind of book you'll pick up in the middle of the night to  read quietly in bed, then laugh so hard you'll shake the bed and wake up  your boyfriend. I just ordered the sequel and had it overnighted to me.  I  can't wait to read what happens next.  Definitely buy this book...you won't  be disappointed!
B00000K19E|3.0|the Matrix fell quite short of my expectations, it is painfully cliche,  theres a good guy and a bad guy, the good guy fights some crucial battle  with the bad guy and wins of course, been there, seen that, its way too  predictable. The story has little depth and just comes down to shootouts  full of special fx, only some one with the taste of a 7year old would call  this good movie making, there is no character development, no depth,  nothing but guns and explosions. Keanu Reeves takes the tiring &quot;act as  little as possible&quot; routine to a new level, as do the rest of the  cast. So bottom line: you can go here just for the special fx but it aint  worth seeing again due to a total lack of decent acting and a good story  line

006109594X|1.0|I found this book started off well, but after the carrier is lost it  starts to drag out. The author drags out conversations and rehashes  information several times. For over half of the book the reader knows the  plainly obvious, which is not that bad, but some of the conclusions drawn  and actions taken by the Americans are just downright outrageous. You don't  get a sense that he is writing from two different perspectives. The action  really never picks up, and the ending is not climactic at all. Downright  disappointing. If you have read or even like Tom Clancy, don't bother with  this book. In fact, don't bother at all, whoever you are.
0780631153|3.0|Anderson is obviously a very talented director and the performances in this film are all quite good but the interweaving stories never really  moved me at all, despite the fact they they were obviously supposed to.   The opening sequence is very original and brilliant, though, and it's  beautifully shot all the way through.  I'd defintitely recommend seeing it  but I'd be surpirsed to find anyone truly blown away by it.

Michael Keaton is the best Batman, Kim Basigner  isn't bad as reporter Vicki Vale, and Jack Nicholson is a definite  showstopper as the psychotic, scene-stealing, hilarious villain as the  Joker. Tim Burton does an excellent direction job, the script is very witty  and good, and Anton Furst's production design is dark, vivid, and also won  an Oscar. Danny Elfman's score is a classic. Possibly the best Batman film,  Batman combines humor with seriousness and Burton's distinct visual style.  Better than the eye candy, special effects driven, colorful comic book  adventures Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin, in which one is good and  the other isn't that good. Also possibly better than the dark, dazzling,  malevolent Batman Returns. Unlike the latest two Batman outings, Batman and  Batman Returns rely on darkness, a great production design, Burton's  direction, great makeup and perfomances, and cleverness. The other Batman  films rely on eye candy, special effects, okay peformances, okay scripts  with some funny lines, and comic book type adventures. They are different  yet both good in different ways. Overall, a blockbuster and very much worth  buying or renting. Enjoy!
B000002JSV|5.0|Outside of Back in Black, this is their best record.  Trust me, if you  like their sound, this is the disc to get.  Bon Scott makes Brian Johnson  look silly and Brian isn't a bad front man at all.  Basically, pick up  every Bon Scott led album by AC/DC and make sure you pick up the Brian  Johnson essentials: Back In  Black, For Those About To Rock, Flick of the  Switch and The Razor's Edge...Powerage is probably their best and for  people who say it isn't, they obviously don't own it...The whole album is  unreal, but good luck avoiding a speeding ticket when Riff Raff, Gimme A  Bullet, Rock and Roll Damnation and Gone Shootin are playing...If I had to  pick one AC/DC record to bring to a desert isle, this is it...
B00003CXFG|5.0|This was one of the best sci-fi thrillers I have ever seen!  It had a lot of action and the anticipation of the unknown really kept me into the  movie.  I would buy this DVD in a heartbeat! Excellent choice!
B0000028UK|5.0|Well, I'm not here to ignite the fires of which incarnation of the  ever-evolving Pearl Jam is &quot;better&quot;, the radio-friendly band that  produced the anthems of &quot;Ten&quot; or the more mature, introspective  authors of &quot;No Code&quot; and &quot;Binaural&quot;. With that out of  the way, Vs. is, in my opinion, the very best example of the soaring  heights achieved by PJ in the &quot;old days&quot;. Vs is really almost a  perfect album. Go and Animal juxtapose brilliantly with Daughter, which in  turn feeds into Glorified G and WMA (the latter two songs are wonderful and  underrated, no matter what the listener's individual politics may be).  Anyway, the album is just great; it features the best qualities of Ten and  enhances them with elements of &quot;Vitalogy-era&quot; complexity. My  favorite PJ album and a magnificent album.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Yes, I gave this album five stars. Half of the people reading this that  own the album are agreeing with me and the other half are shaking their  heads in disgust wondering what it is I see in this &quot;overbloated  collection of experiments.&quot;<br />I rate &quot;London Calling&quot; ahead  of this, but this album sums up the band's ambitions better. They were  fearless; unafraid to try anything and everything regardless of the  public's response. They didn't want to continue playing music that other  bands played, they wanted to experiment with things like reggae, dub,  backwards tracks, and children's choirs. And I, for one, am glad they  did.<br />Mick Jones said in an interview that &quot;Sandinista&quot; wasn't  made for consumption in a single-sitting, and even I have a bit of trouble  making it all the way through uninterrupted. I usually listen to each disc  by itself.<br />Eclectic isn't even the word for this collection of songs. It  runs the gamut from everything to everything else. There's a lot more of a  reggae/dub feel on this album due to Mikey Dread working with the band,  mixing the dub versions, and guesting on a few of the tracks.<br />Every  listen reveals something new. Last time through, I realized that  &quot;Mensforth Hill&quot; is &quot;Something About England&quot; played  backwards with sound effects added on top. It's The Clash's  &quot;Revolution 9,&quot; if you will. (Is it a coincidence that it's on  The Clash's &quot;White Album&quot;??)<br />Sure all the songs aren't top  notch but there are more than enough absolute classics to merit the  purchase. Yes it might have been a stronger double album....but it wouldn't  have been nearly as fun. And considering the limited amount of material the  band recorded, we should be happy with everything we can get.

B00001ZWTS|4.0|the first time i saw this movie, i was amazed at how good it was. The special effects, the gadgets, the script, were all great. Will Smith is at  the top of his form, and Kevin Kline is having the best time in his double  role as Artemus Gordon and the President. I loved the breast touching  scene, the opening credits sequence, Artemus and James running like hell  through the field, Will Smith vs metal man. The writing committee, composed  by S.S. Wilson &amp; Brent Maddock (*batteries not included, Tremors) and  Jeffrey Price &amp; Peter S. Seaman (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, How the  Grinch Stole Christmas), come up with some very funny scenes and hilarious  situations. They have a great sense of humor, as you can also see from  their past works. Anyone who doesn't like this movie does'nt have a sense  of humor. WWW rules!

B00004U9MS|4.0|A good mixture of songs and a very mellow and relaxed sound. The tracks  yellow and shiver stand out but they all have their own individual style  and presence. An above average album. If you like your Britpop you'll like  this.
B00000163G|5.0|Tupac is the realest rapper to ever bless the music industry, and this album shows his amazing talent at its best.
B00004XMVL|5.0|I think the movie was great.It was full of action.Ladies this is a movie you'll like.Having two great lookings guys in it.Vin Diesel who plays the  character of Richard B. Riddick.He plays very well for a character that is  a convict who is bad to the bone.But there is a little thing to him that  make a woman just wanna scream.Maybe because he has a sexy body.The aliens  in the movie are very cool.Bravo to whoever designed these creatures of the  dark.This movie will keep you at the egde of your seat.I think this is  defintly a movie i'll buy and hopefully u would too.
B00000273M|5.0|All the hits are here, and some Susanna-led fillers, I guess. But this  collection is really great to keep in the car for fairly long drives.
B00004XMVL|4.0|While some movies such as Event Horizon and Lost in Space rely on gore, special effects, and/or the movie industry's once a TV show now a movie  formula, Pitch Black uses a fresh cast and an original plot to set itself  apart from other movies in the same genre.  <br />Vin Diesel's progress  through the movie from criminal to humanitarian is more than believable.  I  like this movie because the cast makes it believable, the plot is original,  and the (cgi) special effects are more subtle than other movies that seem  to rely on them almost completely.
B00003CWOL|2.0|I was very disapointed in this film. It starts out as a light hearted  comedy about two angels who were kicked out of Heaven but have now found a  loop hole to get back in. The begining of the film is funny with a lot of  great one liners but after that it's all down hill. This is the kind of  movie were can't stop looking at your watch to try to find out how much  longer you have to sit through this torture.
B000002W9Q|5.0|This soundtrack, along with MORE Dirty Dancing, are my favorite CD's out  of my whole collection.  If you liked the movie at all then you will LOVE  the soundtracks.  They have great music and make you want to dance!!!!
630416923X|4.0|As a serious Beatles fan and trivia maven, I am certainly the last to put down the efforts of the three remaining Beatles to tell their story in  their own words. I thought this was an excellent series, and certainly  worth watching--great soundtrack, cast, plot ;) That said, there are  certain problems inherent in making a documentary of this nature...<br />But  first, the good points.<br />This series has an enormous advantage over  similar Beatles videos &amp; books in that it is done entirely from the POV  of the Beatles and their 'crew.' There is no speculation as to motives,  events, feelings, or any aspect of their career as a band. This is probably  as close to the truth as we will ever get. In addition, this is a  comprehensive overview, from the beginning (early history of each member,  John meeting Paul) to the breakup, with all the tours, albums, and fights  in between. Each surviving member has the chance to give his own  perspective on each event, with the intent of clearing up rumors and  biographers' embellishments.<br />This is where the grey area begins.<br />The  one very obvious absentee of this series is John. For reasons that are  pretty much self-explanatory (he's dead), he could not be included in the  video by any means other than old video clips. The trouble is that during  the Beatle days, none of them were allowed (or thought it at all wise) to  reveal their true feelings about the group. And later on, they were all so  bitter about the breakup that we have to take comments from the 70s-80s  with many, many grains of salt. For this reason, John's voice and real  feelings are notably absent from this video--a tragic omission.<br />Another  issue is that there are some 'delicate' events that the &quot;other  three&quot; may not wish to fully discuss. These include Paul's breakup  with Jane Asher, the Maharishi, drug use, and (of course) the group's  eventual falling apart. I sincerely doubt that Paul, George, or Ringo would  deliberately lie to us, but I suspect that PR agents (or the guys  themselves) may have decided to eliminate certain elements from the  documentary, to work around them, or to omit certain details.<br />Above all,  what should be remembered is that this documentary is done from the Beatles  point of view. Each individual member has a different outlook on each  event, and the real facts may be colored by emotion and passage of time.  <br />But despite these problems, which will affect almost any retrospective  documentary, the Anthology is a wonderful look at the Beatles. I would  strongly recommend it to any fan of the group, and to anyone with an  interest in 60s music and culture.
B00004TH6O|4.0|Somehow current and retro, the Queens'latest is a bracingly bold rock.  Since I am late to this party, I can't talk about how it compares to the  rest of their albums. It hardly matters since QOTSA embrace the guitar in  its many forms. From slabs of sixties soaked rock like  &quot;Auto-Pilot&quot; to reverent and original tributes to Jon Spencer  (Quick and To The Pointless), Screaming Trees (Into The Fade) and, if  you're drunk enough, some sort of Monster Magnet/Nirvana smash-up (Feel  Good Hit of the Summer). To their credit, with all this sound checking they  still find a voice uniquely their own. The two singers pull the band in  different directions but somehow find a mid-point. By embracing all guitar  rock post sixty seven and pre-ninety two, they rise above it all. Don't  miss the cool riff rock of &quot;Leg of Lamb&quot;, the Stooges' horn  skronk meltdown of &quot;Headache&quot; or the rampant rock surrealism of  &quot;Monster in Your Parasol&quot; while you're at it. Simultaneously  poppy and experimental.A real winner. If Sub-Pop had put this out four  years ago, people would have been losing the mind. Riff rock's last great  hurrah.
B00004RI87|5.0|This aibum has John Garcia on it. What else do you need?
0780631153|5.0|&quot;Magnolia&quot; is the latest film by P.T. Anderson,a director whose previous &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; was one of the most exciting pieces of  American cinema to come around since Tarantino.I didn't know what to expect  from &quot;Magnolia&quot;-the commercials were rather vague and even the  glowing reviews didn't give too much away-but I was not prepared to  experience what was the best and most powerful film of the  year.&quot;Magnolia&quot;,like &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is directed in a  restless but controlled kinetic style that is as thrilling to watch as it  intelligent in its organization-every camera movement and editing is not  just there as an empty tour de force-the camera's 360 degree panning and  frequent crosscutting unite the seemingly disparate stories and subtly  reveals its theme as the character's connections to one another become  clearer.And the theme of &quot;Magnolia&quot; is the awful things that  parents do to children(&quot;What Do Kids Know&quot;,the quiz show that  pits adults against children is perfectly emblematic of this)and the final  healing that only can take place when the cancer that both literally and  figuratively consumes(and in this film you are actually shown the cancer)  is itself healed by love(symbolically,the magnolia-a flower believed to be  able to cure cancer).The film's dramatis personae is quite impressive-a  dying powerful television producer-whose past of adultery,abandonment and  neglect catches up with him only to realize some home truths too late;his  golddigging drug addict young wife-tormented by guilt and her own  transgressions;his estranged repellent son-whose only means of attaining  power is establishing a self-empowerment program called &quot;Seduce and  Destroy&quot;,which teaches men to look at women as only holes to be  penetrated-only to be seduced and destroyed himself by a lovely interviewer  gently confronting him with the truth;the gentle and self-effacing  nurse,one of the few good characters in the film who consistently in his  own awkward way tries to help;the child prodigy competing in the producer's  game show-used and taken advantage of by a father who only sees him as a  cash cow-ultimately protesting his objectification during a humiliating  episode on the quiz show-an unforgettable nightmarish scene done with  bravura;a former child prodigy now grown up-lost and hopeless from his own  mistreatment by his own parents; the popular quiz show host-in denial of  his own abusiveness,literally dying on his own show;his junkie  daughter-wasted and running from her past,but capable of inspiring love in  a naive police officer;that police officer-a religious,nice, unassuming  man-trying to find love and respect in this pathological world.The daring  ending with its Biblical overtones ,seems to be as if even nature itself  was in revolt against the stupid and harmful things people do to each  other.My personal favorite scene is the one where the major protagonists  quietly sing Aimee Mann's &quot;Wise Up&quot;,a scene in lesser hands which  would have come across as silly,is exhilarating as it triumphant in  Anderson's power to create the unforgettable.The large cast is so well  acted and has been nominated and won so many awards,  that there is no need  to single out anybody-with the exception of the little-known Melora  Walters,whose performances in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and this film are so  strong,we should be hearing more about her in the future.The only complaint  I have is that the film ended-of course I know not everybody will feel the  same about this harsh,challenging film-but can't that be said for all great art?What an experience.
B00004TL21|5.0|I am thoughly impressed with the new one from The Deftones. This is a  little softer than their earlier work. So if you like a softer sound....GET  THIS! Listen to Digital Bath...Rx Queen...Knife Prty...and Passenger.  Enjoy!
B000000YG5|5.0|Sonny Rollins solidified his claim to the top tenor spot of the late  1950's with albums like, &quot;Way Out West&quot; and this one. His tone is  warm, full, and flawless as he swings his way through this set with Max  Roach on drums, Tommy Flanagan on piano, and Doug Watkins on bass.  The  calypso flavored &quot;St Thomas&quot; opens the disc and is a textbook  example of what makes Rollins great. His playing is effortless, relaxed,  and flawless. He displays a soft touch with sensetive interpretation of the  standard &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is&quot;, and kicks it back into  high gear with the hard charging uptempo &quot;Strode Rode&quot;. He  displays his talent for uncovering unconventional material with a selection  from a German musical here titled &quot;Moritat&quot;. The final track is  the jazz masterpiece &quot;Blue7&quot;. Featuring masterful solos by Roach  and Rollins this track leaves one feeling Sonny is cooler than most people  could hope to be. Saxophone Colossus is one of those rare albums that is  packed with legendary performances and future standards, flawless from top  to bottom. This cd is essential and is guaranteed to delight.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Wow. I'd seen the original American cut of this film 3 or 4 times since it was released in 1988. I just saw the director's cut on the big screen for  the first time and it was amazing. It clocks in at almost an hour longer  than the original version. Personally, I like the Eric Serra soundtrack  included in this version over the Conti one that was released in the  states. There's a synergy between the editing and the music that works for  me. Serra &amp; Besson have worked together on more than 6 films, so the  relationship between the visuals and the music is just right.

B000002MP2|3.0|OK, I know they had 2 albums out before &quot;Dookie,&quot; but when it  all comes down to it, Green Day first hit the big time with this album. I  give it 3 stars not because it was in any way mediocre, but because its not  a CD that I can just put in the player and listen to all the way through,  there are a few tracks I'd rather skip. This is not so with  &quot;Nimrod,&quot; their latest, which came out a few years  ago.<br />Nonetheless, &quot;Dookie&quot; was a great album. Six years after  its release I still love listening to &quot;Basket Case,&quot; &quot;When I  Come Around,&quot; &quot;Pulling Teeth,&quot; &quot;Longview,&quot; and  &quot;Welcome To Paradise.&quot; Every now and then I still hear  &quot;WICA&quot; on the radio. This is the staying power &quot;Dookie&quot;  has.<br />If you're new to Green Day, I suggest picking up &quot;Dookie&quot;  first before going on to &quot;Insomniac&quot; or &quot;Nimrod.&quot; It  will give you a good feel of the punk style of Green Day and let you fully  realize whether you like the music or not.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|U-571 can easily be ranked right up there with Saving Private Ryan in the war category.  This movie is very realistic and although I do not know what  the DVD will be like I can make a bet that it will be a very good one!  I  suggest anyone should buy this that likes war movies or just good action  movies.  Go U-571!
B00003CXAR|5.0|A lot of people I know criticize widescreen format videos and DVDs. They  say it looks like part of the movie is cut off. JAWS is the film I use to  convert them. I show them the video I own in pan-and-scan mode, usually a  scene where the shark pops out of the water when Brody, Hooper, and Quint  are on the boat. Then I show them the DVD widescreen version.<br />What a  difference! In the first version, you can only see most of the shark's head  and one of the people on board. In the widescreen, you see everyone.  Spielberg has a terrific eye and knows how to compose a frame. And the  widescreen format is the only way to do justice to this fun and scary  film.<br />The new DVD also has terrific and rich color. The sound is great  and will remind you why John William's soundtrack is famous 25 years later.  But you can also hear other sound effects Spielberg stuck in, like a muted  dinosaur roar when the shark is sinking at the end. This, along with many  other interesting tidbits, was revealed to me with a behind-the-scenes  featurette that comes with the extras on the DVD. There's interviews with  the cast members today, as well as a fun trivia game. I also found the  deleted scenes interesting, although I'm glad Spielberg didn't use them.  The extras gave me a glimpse on how a film is made. When I rewatched the  film, I had a new outlook to what went into it. The outtakes and the photo  gallery were useless, but don't let that stop you from buying this. If  you're a fan of the film, you will want to own this.
B00003W8NM|5.0|&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a brilliant film.  Most people think it is just a bunch of guys fighting the whole film, but it's not even close to that.   If you watch this movie and pay close attention, it will pay off in the  end, believe me.  And that's not even metioning the bonus features, which  are spectacular.  Which include many deleted scenes.  So take my word for  it, and rent/buy it today.
B00004T8RK|4.0|It's the year 2000, and the music industry is looking pretty grim.  Record  companys are looking for the catchy singles that will make them rich  quickly and no longer seem to care about longetivity.  In the current rock  scene, it's not likely that more than 10 percent of the bands on the charts  today will still be around in 5 years.  Fortunately Pearl Jam has come  along and given us a breath of fresh air with 'Binaural'.  Another artsy  rock album from the greatest rock band of the '90s.  Heck, they're one of  the greatest of the last 20 years.  With songs like 'Evacuation',  'Insignifigance', and my personal favorite 'Grievance', you have easily the  best hard rock album so far this year.  Then you've got the moving 'Light  Years', the dark 'Nothing As It Seems', and 'Soon Forget', an Eddie Vedder  solo on the ukelele.  Its a beautiful album all around, reminiscent of  bands like the Who and the Rolling Stones.  I just saw the band Open their  North American tour in Virginia Beach, in which they played 8 of the songs  from 'Binaural'.  It was spectacular.  So, if you haven't already, go buy  the album and see what real rock and roll is all about.
B00003CX5A|5.0|&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is wonderful on DVD and is a great movie.   Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are wonderful in it.  This is probably one  of Tim Burton's best.  The special effects on this DVD are great.   Especially the scene with the windmill.  The bonus features are also very  good.  I suggest for anyone to buy this that likes funny horror films.
B00004NHCC|5.0|I am just getting into the whole world of vocal jazz, but I do know that  this is one of the most incredible albums I have heard.  I have been a long  time fan of Clifford Brown and he is absolutely stellar here, as is Paul  Quinchette.  The combination of her amazing voice with solid, smooth solos  makes this a perfect album to just pop in, relax and just enjoy life!   Definitely reccomended!
0880389052|5.0|HOMELAND is one of those rare books which you started reading....but  cannot put down. R.A. Salvatore have elaborated and expanded upon what we  (AD&amp;D gamers) know about the dark elves, which, at the time, consist of  the D series modules, into a story so detailed, so rich, so engaging that  this one of the best novels I have ever read. Salvatore also developed the  characters into such depths that even the evil characters (which is most of  them), you can understand their motivations....one NEEDED to be evil and  hateful in order to survive in a twisted society. Sometimes, you might  actually found youself rooting for the Do'Urden family in their relentless  quest for power and prestige.<br />You don't have to be familiar with the  Dungeons and Dragons game in order to be entertain by this novel. It is  self contained and contain enough information here so the totally clueless  can get into it. <br />The only fault I found in this book is how Drizzt  himself seems to be so clueless about the society around him...is he really  so sheltered that he doesn't know about the twisted truths about his  people?<br />Homeland is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. You  will not regret it.
B00000DF6O|5.0|Man, B.B. is 74 these days? I don't believe it and neither will you after  you experience this juicy slab of blues work. The voice is as sweet and  thick as ever, the fingers are still making Lucille whimper, and the band  is one of the tightest I've ever heard anywhere. The fact that this was  laid down in four days without dubs just proves what everyone already  knows: there will never, ever be another like B.B.!
0553213105|3.0|I must admit that this is a very well written book: the situations, the  characters, the idea.  I must also admit, though, that for that very fact,  I didn't enjoy the book.  The book was a comedy of manners on society and  people.  Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it.  This is not to say that there is a flaw in Austen's writing.  She is a most  excellent authoress.  I was so annoyed by the well-written characters that  I couldn't enjoy them.
0140177396|2.0|May I use this opportunity to express my strong dissatisfaction at Steinbeck's book &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. As a story it could have been  much more elaborated but, to my dissapointment it was not.     Reading the  first chapter I was mysled to believe that I was going to find a good and   interesting  book due to the excellent descriptions. Instead, i found that  he used the same style of description during the entire book making it  repetitive and boring. Secondly, the only scenes of the book that were, in   my opinion, worthwhile ended up being violent &quot;He slashed at Lennie  with his left&quot;, &quot;Blood run down Lennies face&quot;. Finally, the  entire ending of the book was my mayor disappointment as, it ends in a way  that leaves a great deal of issues unconcluded, such as George's future. I  think that the ending is very poor and leaves much to be desired.        In  conclusion, I believe the story did not live up to standard and I would not  recommend it as it gives us a fake idea of what the book will be but, tears  it apart as you go deeper into the story.
B000002L6P|5.0|I really think this album still has the stylish lyrics and music it  possessed almost 16 years ago. The usual favorites- Material Girl, Angel,  Dress You Up, and like a Virgin are wonderful as well as some rare finds.  The poppy, optimistic &quot;Over &amp; over&quot; sends listeners the  message that if you try, anything can be accomplished.Madonna's cover of  Rose Royce's &quot;Love don't live here anymore&quot; is a sad lonely song  with a haunting string background. the slow tempo &quot;Shoo be doo&quot;  has a girl telling her boy friend that she hates to see him down, and this  brings her down. The uptempo, synthesizer filled, &quot;Pretender&quot; is  the story of how a girl falls for a guy who plays around, and she finds  herself asking why she fell for him in the first place. But my favorite  song, the last song on the album,&quot;Stay&quot; is a old fashioned 80's  mid tempo love song with &quot;doo-de-lee-bee-bops&quot; and a feeling of  nostalgia, and a cheerful nature.<br />all &amp; all a great album to last for  all time.
0671034065|5.0|One thing Howard fans can never complain about is that their favorite author is getting complacent. It seems that every few books or so, Ms.  Howard gets restless with constraints and &quot;pushes the envelope&quot;  in her genre.  Other reviewers here seem to be a little offended and  shocked by this latest push, but this reader found it to be a refreshing  blast of humor and bawdiness, with conversations that mimicked what most  modern day couples THINK, if they don't actually say it out loud. She drops  the f*-bomb a few times, but most of her readers are not shrinking violets,  and the conversations have an authentic feel to them.<br />Most striking about  this story is the authentic feel to it. We are all being bombarded with  &quot;romantic suspense&quot; these days, but this story is different  because Howard creates very real, gritty, strong female characters with  flaws and weaknesses, and we learn to love them throughout the story, warts  and all. When some of these characters become the VICTIMS, the effect is  jolting, and the reader feels the same grief as the surviving  characters.<br />Even with the new grittiness, the elements we all seek and  love in Howard novels are still preserved in this one. The alpha-male, Sam,  the pithy heroine, Jaine, the incendiary sex-scenes. All are present and  accounted for.<br />She did a great job with this story, and I loved it!

0790743132|2.0|Casablanca is a classic but NOT because the story is so wonderful.   Actually the script could be properly described as sentimental fluff.  But  what a cast --absolutely a director's dream-- Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid  Bergman, Peter Lorre, Conrad Viedt, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul  Henreid and others...  Fortunately these talented people were able to  transcend the silly script and made this movie a crowd-pleaser and a  classic that's worth watching.
B00003CWRX|5.0|An excellent Drama, well acted, intelligent film
B000002U3P|5.0|I loved the movie, so I naturally had to rush out and buy the soundtrack.   While it probably isn't for everyone, those people who found themselves  swaying to the music should definitely get this.  Some of the songs can  drag or have tedious bits, but I enjoy all of them. They're very easy to  get into, I listen to them when just get up to get myself going(it actually  works, too). SO if you liked the movie, go and get this, you won't be  disappointed.
B000002GQH|5.0|One of the great things about The Moody Blues' earlier albums was the cover art.  Phil Travers, I believe is featured here, if not, on most of  them.  Some of 'Threshold's' feeling (and looks)are like what younger kids  were calling 'Goth' a few years back - it's sort of dark, but in an  imaginative and positive way.  'Lovely to See You' is a fun hit, but there  are others - 'Send Me No Wine' for one.  'In the Beginning' is an oddly  prophetic drama/dialogue where one is told that they are &quot;magnetic  ink&quot; - to suit the &quot;great computer&quot;...   This album has all  the elements of classic Moody broodiness and creativity, and even takes you  on a magical voyage back to Camelot - if you're 'sitting comfortably'...
0792101448|1.0|This film is a waste of money.It is so slow you can see moss  grow on the actors.It should be called Faces.If you can stand  to watch the whole  laborious thing.You will know every pore in the face of the major actors.I  bought this Poor excuse for anything from Amazon.
0671027344|5.0|I just finished this book about an hour ago...and all I can say and think  is...wow.  What an amazing inspiring story that everyone can relate to.   Truly amazing.  I can't even find the right words to describe how I feel  about the book, but if you are a human who has any feelings at all, I  recomend this book to you.  I can't wait to read another book by Stephen  Chbosky.
006097625X|3.0|McCloud sketchily reviews comics history, dissects the anatomy of comics, and meditates on human thought and visual perception. There's something here for lots of people.<BR>His analyses of, say, the components of the creative process,  might be debated -- but he invites discussion. Comics readers will learn a thing or two. Comics disparagers or ignorers would be enlightened if someone kindly left this book where they'd scan it.
B000003CMB|5.0|You'll never hear better music than on this album.  A powerhouse rhythm  section with two drummers drives the band; one a jazz specialist and the  other nicknamed Freight Train for his aggresive style and a bassist that  roams everywhere under the lead.  There's no such thing as a dead spot on  this album, that rhythm section makes sure of that.  Gregg Allman's  gravelly voice lends a bluesy feel reminiscent of the old Delta bluesmen  and his Hammond B-3 playing is absolutely spectacular.  Dickey Betts is on  fire with his blues playing and his instrumental In Memory of Elizabeth is  a highlight on the album.  Duane Allman's playing is as usual...phenomenal.   Just to give you an idea of Duane's skill on the guitar...go listen to  Derek and the Dominoes &quot;Layla&quot;...Eric Clapton's pride and joy.   Well, Duane was the only one that took a solo for that one.
1558807381|2.0|I picked up legend because my daughter is into the fantasy genre (Ladyhawke, Dragonheart, Pricess Bride).  I was dissappointed with this  movie.  <br />Legend has all the elements that should make it a great fantasy  film, Unicorns, fairies, elves, goblins. . . an innocent princess and a  really evil villan.  Somehow it still falls flat.  It never inspires a real  rapport with the characters.  The best character is Tim Curry's devil.   <br />The emphasis of the film is more on the visual scenery than the  storyline.  Way too much time is spent grubbing around in &quot;hell&quot;,  which was way too creepy for us.  Tom Cruise was a two dimensional hero.   Not enough substance there to get worked up over.  <br />Our two girls (10  &amp; 11) were very disturbed by it, to the point they couldn't sleep.  I  don't recommend it for pre-teens.
B000000OA6|5.0|It's no secret. Queen does what they want and how they want. This album is  no exception. From the first song to the last, you get amazing lyrics  committed by the whole band and hair raising music. Innuendo must be one of  the greatest albums of all time. It has such a force and overall feeling  thru out the whole thing. We all know Freddie was dying during the making  of this and that just gives it more strength. To think he could push on and  sound so great when any other singer would have been worn down and would  have given up. Every song on this album is just huge. from  &quot;innuendo&quot; to &quot;bijou&quot; it's almost too much to take in  on the first listen. to actually feel yourself losing it on &quot;i'm going  slightly mad&quot; and to feel your blood pulse with &quot;headlong&quot;  and your heart smile on &quot;these are the days of our lives&quot;. Before  I conclude this I will talk about my favourite Queen song and probably one  of the greatest...&quot;The show must go on&quot; was almost like the last  stand of Queen. One of the only times where Queen basically reached out to  the people listening to it. Queen, not usually the most personal band made  a huge statement by one line and everyone that listens to it, knows it's  more than just the last song on the album. it was almost like their thank  you to us. Well thank you Queen.
0140177396|4.0|This book was different from other books because it's themes were not usual and it had a very strange development. The themes it treated were  loneliness, violence, dreams and authority. Each of this themes were very  well developed by the author. The characters had a very important part in  the book, even the ones which were not principal treated the themes in a  very deep way. For example Curley's wife who developed the theme, dreams,  showed the importance of them. How she was so full of hopes and wishes and  in the end although she didn't achieve them she had still the HOPE she  would. The principal characters were George and Lennie. George is an  inteligent and small character who travels along with Lennie. Lennie is  huge and mentaly retarded. In the book he represents the theme dreams and  violence. Both George and Lennie have a big dreams, to have a house, a  couple of acres, a cow, a pig and for Lennie, to pet some rabbits. Then  Candy, another character, became part of there dream. <br />This book is  dealing with the life of itinerary workers, there loneliness and life. It  shows life in a real but awful way. This book made me realize how inocent  and lonely people raelly are.
0679777547|5.0|Lucas Corso is an unusual kind of private detective.  He's &quot;a mercenary of the book world,&quot; hunting down rare books for wealthy  collectors.  If that includes arranging for a theft and having confederates  disguise the book's provenance, so be it.  Corso knows all the angles.<br />In  The Club Dumas, however, his latest case unexpectedly takes detours into  violence and satanism.  Corso has twin tasks: verifying the authenticity of  a manuscript chapter of Dumas's The Three Musketeers and discovering  whether a medieval volume, The Nine Doors, is a forgery.  This book  supposedly holds the secret of calling up Satan, and copies were burned  during the Inquisition.  <br />As he plumbs the murky depths of The Nine Doors  and delves into the world of Alexander Dumas, Corso's case grows more and  more phantasmagorical.  He's stalked, beaten, becomes an accessory to  murder, falls in love with a mysterious young woman who may be a devil, and  becomes convinced someone has enmeshed him in a bizarre re- enactment of  The Three Musketeers.  <br />Critics have compared the author to Umberto Eco,  but The Club Dumas lacks the heavy hand of the literary critic.  It's a  fast-paced, joyously complex and inventive book, imbued with a passion for  literature.  Prepare to be amused and amazed by this funny, bizarre set of  puzzles within puzzles.  And if you're a book lover, or have a special  fondness for The Three Musketeers, this novel is an unforgettable feast.
630528069X|4.0|Despite a lacklustre set of DVD extras, and a better-value boxed set, this  is the most essential of the 'Die Hard' films. Influential enough to spawn  a genre of itself (even today, certain films are 'a bit like Die Hard'),  this film combined the '70s disaster movie with a fashionable set of chic  european bad guys and a plot which saw a lone hero use wit, courage and an  MP5 to defeat a numerically-superior opposing force. Put like that, the  film sounds merely adequate, but the beauty is in the execution - 'Die  Hard' is polished. It looks and sounds gorgeous, and is paced so that,  after a short introduction, it's constant action until the finale. It took  Bruce Willis a decade of solid work to step from the shadow of his John  McClane character. Only Willis' hair and the awful, awful trailer have  dated from 1988.
1573227978|4.0|Following the ever so similar plot line of Lord of the Flies, The Beach is  instantly liked.  Like Lord of the Flies, the story takes place on an  uninhabited tropical island and traces the conflicts between each person.   Also included are the usual problems with being separated from the rest of  civilization.  Injuries, lack of professional care, shortages of food and  water, and everything else that comes with the territory.<br />The tale starts  with a map given to a tourist visiting Thailand.  As curiosity builds, the  man (along with a French couple that also discover the map) decide to find  what the X points to.  Following the drawn path, they find what they were  looking for, the perfect world.  Upon landing, they find a tropical  paradise with infinite marijuana fields, any 20-something's dream.  After  further wandering, the group finds a small band of islanders, who, like  them, also came following a map.  Without taxes, pollution, boring jobs, or  the rest of humanity (along with an abundance of mary jane), no one has  ever wanted to leave.<br />However, like the currently popular TV show,  Survivor, problems between the group members occur rather suddenly.  The  trio of newcomers has a hard time fitting in to the new world.  The main  character's fear of confrontations and habit of keeping discoveries to  himself creates distrust between the rest of the group.  The monarchy used  to govern the colony also creates difficulties since many don't believe the  right choices are being made.<br />It's an interesting adventure novel, but  the attitude of the main character got on my nerves a bit.  He trusts very  few people, and finds problems with lots of things.  He lends a helping  hand only when told to and often tries to hide from authority to keep from  obtaining a chore.  In a way, he caused most of the problems on the island.   This problem occurs just enough to be noticeable and annoying, but if you  can brush that aside, and read the book for its story and deeper meaning,  then I suggest it.
B00003CXAR|4.0|A simple, well-executed horror / action movie that combines winning performances, some memorable quotes ('We're going to need a bigger boat' is  on a par with the 'You've gotta be kidding me' from 'The Thing'), and a  great score, 'Jaws' touched a nerve in the 70's and started off a wave of  cheaply-produced 'nature-vs-man' films, none of which (especially not the  sequels, although '2' had its moments) even remotely approached the level  of craftsmanship and belief exhibited by this film. Characterisation and  acting are excellent - the heroes are far from being superhuman, and even  the soon-to-be-obligatory Mayor character is not evil, merely  short-sighted. Enormously popular - one of a handful of films to gross more  than 100 million dollars in the 1970's, along with 'The Godfather', 'The  Exorcist' and 'Star Wars' - and responsible for all kinds of great things,  'Jaws' is foremost great, crowd-pleasing entertainment, the kind of film  that you can watch any time and it's still fun. Cineastes have read a  wealth of depth into the film, but at heart it's a very simple tale of  great white hunters going off to tame the wilderness, and finding that the  wilderness is not so easily tamed.
0671034065|5.0|This has to be one of Linda Howards all time best books.  I have to tell  you that I laughed out loud during parts of this book.  She made the  characters all too real!!  If you like romance combined with a good story  line and a little suspense, you will love this book.  I highly recommend  it!!
B000002J6H|5.0|I have to agree with all the above comments being outraged by the comments  Stills was the least accomplished of CS &amp; N. If it were just between  him and Young, i'd say it was strictly a matter of taste however, least  accomplished compared to Nash and Crosby ?. Just for technical ability  alone this would be dead wrong but if you consider Still's tunes even  before CS and N with the Springfield compared to Crosby and Nash's output  pre, during and post CSN, Cmon (Sweet Judy Blue Eyes compared to Almost Cut  my Hair-I think not).    This is a great album with great tunes, singing  and playing. Hey i'll tell you how to judge whose the most accomplished.  Put Crosby and Nash on stage and let them perform anything solo, then put  on Black Queen from this album, that should stop this debate about,  &quot;least accomplished&quot; right in its tracks.
0446677450|1.0|This book was not only poorly written and edited, but there was no real content. This was a typical infomercial, with the caveat that you buy his  $200.00 game board -- that's what is really disturbing. Atleast Robbins and  Ziglar are upfront with their stories. I would not waste the money on this  book. Read anything but this.
068818071X|5.0|Once again, Marian Keyes has given me every penny's worth in her latest  novel *Rachel's Holiday*. I liked Lucy Sullivan, LOVED Watermelon...and now  I can barely descibe the rush of feelings I am experiencing after devouring  this book in just 2 days!!! Although there is a serious storyline in each  book, Keyes tackled a far more intense subject in her latest. She did it  with tact, talent and humor. I have never been an addict, but I have loved  several. Keyes portrayed the situation and the feelings involved perfectly.  Like other reviewers I, too, found myself sad that this wonderful book had  to come to an end. And so I say,  &quot;Marian...please, type  quickly!!!&quot;

6305949638|4.0|The line &quot;Kings of New England&quot; so dispised by BobThompson, was not a line created by the movie makers. John Irving had Dr. Larch use the  line every night after reading to the orphans. The movie simply followed  the book, and very well at that. This is not the best movie I've ever seen,  but it's one that I'll add to my collection and see several times, just as  I read the book several times.
B00000ILDF|4.0|The third of the Alien saga is also perhaps the most critically mauled of  the series. Predictably, almost inevitably, first-time director David  Fincher fails to live up to the first two films; but Alien 3 showcases the  strikingly dark and moody visual style of its creator perfectly: dimly lit  corridors criss-cross a claustrophobic prison facility where there are no  weapons, and from which there is no escape. True, the script is largely  second-rate; true too, the acting is rarely better than adequate, save the  ever-reliable Weaver. Also, this being a David Fincher(better known for  Se7en and Fight Club)film, any notion of an upbeat ending goes straight out  of the window quite early on(the ending, in particular, was savaged by  fans- perhaps with some justification). However Alien 3 would have made an  acceptable conclusion to the Alien- and more importantly the Ripley- saga,  had it not been for Jeunet and his Alien: Resurrection, which left the  series once again in limbo after a truly corny(&quot;I'm a stranger here  myself...&quot;) ending.
0800128052|5.0|&quot;Rudy&quot; is uplifting in its own sappy, goofy way, and it's impossible not to cheer. It's the true story of Daniel &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruettiger, an unremarkable student and football player from 1970s working-class Chicago with the very remarkable dream of playing football for the University of Notre Dame. He overcomes everything you can think of--poverty, doubtful parents, bad grades, friend's death, height deficiency, girlfriends, learning disability--to accomplish his goal, and believe it or not, the movie is every bit as inspiring as it claims to be.<br />The ending is predictable (with the truth being stretched by more than those few seconds) but doesn't detract from his struggle to land in the House that Rock built. Its charm comes from a great ensemble cast that delivers solid performances throughout. Sean Astin does well as the pint-size player, allowing his character to be more than the typical wholesome underdog. Rudy's frustrations with his family, school, and football all resonate clearly on screen, in effect making his triumph all the more powerful. Ned Beatty as the father powers the familial tensions that drive Rudy to succeed while Jon Favreau's D-Bob, Rudy's loyal bud, lends a gentle touch of humor. His two mentors, played by Charles Dutton and Robert Prosky, add strong doses of determination and prayer, respectively. Director David Anspaugh wisely capitalizes on Notre Dame's beautiful campus by using the scenery to frame the luckless student's persistence and desire. A moving score by Jerry Goldsmith coupled with Notre Dame chants and fight songs balance the emotional visuals.<br />There are many elements that will appeal to an audience of any age including relationships within the family, overcoming obstacles, self-motivation, etc. As an ND student, I admit my bias, but in fairness to the movie, &quot;Rudy&quot; will capture your heart; be assured, this film survives multiple viewings.
B000005HBI|5.0|If I compare the CD's Cassandra Wilson has released so far, in retrospect  this one is the best sounding and the most honest one. Listen to her  version of  \\"Come On In My Kitchen\\", a blues song also performed by The  Steve Miller Band on their CD \\"The Joker\\". Cassandra Wilson shows here the  same talent as Holly Cole, that is to internalize the song. Her voice is  rather demanding and often somewhat dominant, but you can also experience  the phenomenon of her voice becoming an instrument under instruments.  According to me the best songs on this CD are: \\"Tell Me You'll Wait For  Me\\", \\"Hellhound On My Trail\\" (beautiful guitar accompaniment and a  grumbling cornet) and \\"I Can't Stand The Rain\\". These are strong songs with  little but adequate accompaniment and they sound like life performances,  which is rather a compliment in these days of sonic trash!
B00003CXFG|4.0|Turn off your brain and have fun..this is a really slick movie if you give it a chance. I've been waiting for this DVD for quite some time :)
B00000K19E|5.0|Without a doubt a landmark and influential film.  The DVD is the  &quot;Platinum Standard&quot; for DVDs.  An instant classic.  I can't wait  for the next two films!
B00002E233|4.0|Before seeing this movie, I was not much of a Renny Harlin fan. And  afterwards, maybe I'm still not that much of a Renny Harlin fan; I mean Die  Hard 2 was good, but it was far from its predecessor. But this movie--OH  DEAR GOD!!--it made my day, and the next week. Okay, so you have to be in  the right mindset. Summer-action-effects-extravaganza. Nothing more,  nothing less. But Harlin knows how to push your buttons; not the emotional  ones like Spielberg, but the gut-wrenching, visceral ones that make you  want to eat red meat and take no prisoners. (Sorry, I'm getting a little  carried away.)<br />Yeah, the plot is pretty simple. Scientists find a cure  for Alzheimer's in sharks' brains, must make sharks' brains bigger causing  them to get smart and do really bad things, stuff blows up, some people  die, some people make it. Most scenes can easily be deconstructed--this is  where the hero-stud tells Mr. Man how it really is, etc.--but so what, like  you're watching this movie (and it is a movie, not a film) for the nuanced  characters and subtle plot developments.<br />Maybe I'm selling the characters  short. Some are really bad, like the blond &quot;Let me explain the layout  of Aquatica&quot; chick and some are just awesome like Thomas &quot;Boogie  Nights&quot; Jane, as the hero-stud. This guy redefines the term. He's  saving lives, throwing out subtle one-liners, and just kicking tail and  taking names on practically a scene-by-scene basis. I could go on (and on)  but there are other things I must tell you.<br />For example, LL Cool J has  the best (ie chessiest) one liner: &quot;It's feedin' time&quot; (turn it  up and play it over and over again, baby!). Michael Rappaport is the  world's greatest underused comic actor. And Samuel L. Jackson? Where do I  begin? Just watch this movie and you'll know where I end.<br />This is not the  greatest movie I've ever seen. It definitely takes a particular mindset (I  know I'm repeating myself), but if you expect little, you will be awarded  with more than you could have possibly desired. Recommended (lesser) double  feature companion: Lake Placid (for Oliver Platt &amp; the sheriff, if  nothing else).
B00001SIES|4.0|An excellent debut album for Muse, Showbiz contains a remarkable amount of  energy and power, flowing brilliantly through the 12 tracks.  Inevitable  comparisons between Matthew Bellamy and Radiohead's Tom Yorke are, however,  unavoidable and hence lead you into comparisons of the two British bands -  an unfair situation for Muse given Radiohead's enormous reputation.   Bellamy, on his part, shows tremendous vocal range and emotion, yet does  tend to over-accentuate his breathing on occasion, while his playing of a  vast number of instruments adds great variety for a three-piece. Very close  to 5 stars.
0195067142|5.0|I have been an avid reader of World War II publications for over ten  years.  My father served in the South Pacific at the War's end, and rarely  speaks of the horrors of his experiences in World War II.  Eugene Sledge  recalls two of the most horrific battles American Marines fought in the  Pacific Theater of Operations.  What these men faced every day is almost  incomprehensible.  Having grown up in a strong Catholic family, I know all  about Purgatory, Hell, and the Eternal Lake of Fire;  Having read  &quot;With the Old Breed on Peleliu and Okinawa,&quot; I truely believe  those men who fought in either of those two campaigns could write a book on  those places mentioned.
B000002UKS|5.0|When you come to think of it, Nirvana were really a band out of this  world, for the simple reason that the band included two of the greatest  songwriters rock has ever known. Kurt Cobain(RIP) who is THE best, and the  underrated Dave Grohl, now fronting this band who are trying to be removed  from the shadows of the former Seattle grungers.This more upbeat grunge  band also includes ex-Nirvana guitarist Pat Smear and this album, their  second and unlike their debut CD, is simply wonderful.                  Grohl shows his writing skills by transforming heavy, hard, depressive  music into upbeat, poppy, happy, catchy songs.His upbeat, boyish vocals  supported by fast guitaring and heavy drumming. The upbeat songs on the  album such as the radio song 'Monkey Wrench', the contrasting 'Up In Arms'  and the emotional epic 'My Hero' are the songs which are great speeding  along in a fast car on a sunny day. They make me think of a more upbeat  Nirvana.This album has more depressive songs on it although. Grohl seems to  be writing about about a relationship break-up in some of the songs such as  'Walking After You', 'See You', and 'Everlong' but are all still  brilliant.There is not a lot  of negative points that I can make about this  album. It will be impossible for the Foo Fighters to become greater than  bands like Soundgarden or Nirvana but if they keep producing records as  good as this they will earn a place of greatness in their own right.
0767812166|5.0|Those of you still thinking that Halloween is director John Carpenter's  greatest achievement need to look elsewhere, namely right here with  Starman.  A Sci-Fi/Romantic drama released back in 1985 that is so  captivating, so moving and endearing, that it leaves you breathless with  deep emotion and thought.  Can you not be touched by the scene involving a  dead deer?  I've seen this film so many times and it never loses it's  luster.  Jack Nitzsche's music is so haunting, so alluring, so powerful  with a wonderful mystical sense of longing that it draws you even further  into the picture.  John Carpenter has never made another film like this.   It's his masterpiece because it gives us so many layers that are not found  in any of his other works.  You will care about these people.  You will  truly want them to be together.  It's all there.  This movie has so much  heart and compassion for life.  If you are not touched then please open  your heart a little more.  A special note to Columbia Pictures: Please  release a Special Edition of this film with an audio commentary by John  Carpenter, Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen (all in the same room together if  possible).  Mr. Carpenter has done many Special Edition DVD's for his  films.  Starman must not be the exception.
B000003TA4|5.0|I honestly don't think that I can say anything about this album that  hasn't been said already only just for god's sake quit moaning about the  money inside your pocket and just buy the bloody thing. It's the album  which made me develop an interest for serious music.Is that enough or do  you need to go and read another ten thousand reviews to be convinced to  part with the 10 dollars for the record? No? Okay, so it's the best rock  album ever made. Enough? If not, I give up, keep your money. Bury it in a  hole six feet deep!!!
B0000399WI|5.0|The only thing I can say about The Shawshank Redemption is that is was  brilliant, one of the best (if not the best) films I have ever seen.  Everything from the plot and the characters to, well, everything was  fantastic. You must have this.
B000001FN8|4.0|I am a huge scorpions fan. I have a few other cds of them as well. Savage  Amusement is a very good cd but the reason i gave it four stars instead of  five is because of the lack of strength certain songs have. Songs like  &quot;Media Overkill&quot; just are annoying because of the chorus which is  incredibley weak. Anyways besides that song and maybe one other I highley  recommend this album.

6303014100|4.0|&quot;Gettysburg&quot; has its faults: the phony beards that look like the  kind you can buy at a drugstore for Halloween, the large number of  overweight and overaged extras, the questionable casting (Martin Sheen as  Robert E. Lee?  Brian Mallon as Winfield S. Hancock?), the nearly bloodless  battle scenes, the poorly choreographed hand-to-hand combat scenes, cannons  firing with no recoil, extras staring into the camera or smiling at  inappropriate times, and so on and so on.  Most of these quibbles, however,  can be explained away by the movie's TV production budget and its almost  exclusive reliance on the services of Civil War reenactors as extras  without whom &quot;Gettysburg&quot; could have never been made. Also, due  to the &quot;Gettysburg's&quot; faithfulness to Michael Shaara's novel,  &quot;The Killer Angels;&quot;  several scenes of &quot;dialogue&quot; come  across as very stilted and artificial- Sam Elliot's Buford talking about  the high ground or Tom Berenger's Longstreet discussing his thoughts about  the upcoming Pickett's Charge.  In the book those scenes were thoughts not  conversation; but too many longwinded voiceovers would have been overkill,  so the movie has the actors giving monologues to a nodding supporting  actor.<br />Despite its faults, I love, love, LOVE this movie.  I saw it four  times in the theater and uncountable number of times on video.  It's a  Civil War buff's dream film.  I think Jeff Daniels and Tom Berenger are  superb and I really love Stephen Lang's Pickett.  The Battle for Little  Round Top and Pickett's Charge are spectacular.  The musical score was one  of the best of the 90's.  Even the opening credits are alot of fun to  watch.  Also &quot;Gettysburg&quot; contains numerous little details that  only buffs will recognize: A.P. Hill, Myles Keogh, Alonzo Cushing, G.K.  Warren, Augustus Ellis Van Horne, 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters, the Texas  Brigade, the Iron Brigade in their distinctive black hats, the Irish  Brigadereceiving absolution from Fr. Corby, Stannard's Vermonters, the  Irish 69th PA at the Angle, the reenacting of a Homer Winslow painting, one  armed Oliver Howard, Alexander Webb played by Brian Pohonka, the Union  divisional emblems, and numerous others.  Director Ronald Maxwell went out  his way to accomodate these little details, and they add alot of enjoyment  to the movie.<br />In its review one Civil War magazine described  &quot;Gettysburg&quot; as a &quot;great shaggy dog of a thing&quot;- it's a  little sloppy at times; but still highly loveable.  Should a movie about  Gettysburg be loveable?   Does &quot;Gettysburg's&quot; battle scenes, with  their stirring music and minimal bloodshed, do justice to the carnage of  July 1-3, 1863?   Definetly not.  Maybe someday a filmmaker with access to  a HUGE budget and all the latest CGI and special effects technology will do  for Pickett's Charge what Speilberg did for Omaha Beach; but I'm not going  to hold my breath waiting.  Until then I will enjoy &quot;Gettysburg&quot;  for what it is- a terrific attempt to bring to life one of the classic war  novels and a film that belies its television production orgins.
0140177396|5.0|I have read the book and i've really enjoyed reading it. I think it's a  heart-touching book because it helps you to realize there are important  things in life for which you have to fight. The book relates about 2 men,  fighting for their dream. these men Are George and Lennie, which are really  well interpreted in the movie. My favourite character is George, he is  responsible and small. The book gives you many messages, my favourite one  is to fight for dreams and happiness. Even if some people don't make their  dream come true, some would do. I've goven 5 stars to this book because  i've had fun reading it.
B00003CWL6|4.0|Let's see, the cultural conservatives hate this movie because it leaves no possible dysfunctionality unturned.  And hard-core artsy types don't care  for it because it's not nearly audacious ENOUGH. But most viewers, I  suspect, will find an intelligently paced, very well acted and beautifully  shot film that they will not quickly forget.  Kevin Spacey and Annette  Bening got the Oscar nods, but the younger actors, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley  and Mena Suvari were all spot on.  And Chris Cooper and Peter Gallagher  turned in remarkable performances as well.  I won't say it's a perfect  movie, but it is a film of genuine substance--the kind that lends itself to  multiple interpretations and multiple viewings.
B00000JCOV|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Wait And Bleed&quot; on the local radio, I just  thought that this was another KoRn clone.  Then i saw the video, and I was  blown away!  These guys really AREN'T a KoRn clone, and these guys can  definately hold their own, as said by this great CD.  The CD starts out  weird, but kicks right into action with &quot;(sic)&quot; and  &quot;Eyeless&quot;, my favorite track on the album.  &quot;Wait And  Bleed&quot;, &quot;Spit It Out&quot;, and &quot;Surfacing&quot; are all  singles from the album, and all of these tracks are good also.  &quot;Me  Inside&quot; is also an AWESOME track, and it shows that Corey, #8, can  actually sing, although he doesn't do much of it.  The second half is just  as good as the first, and altogether this creates an excellent from the  Iowa boys.  Do yourself a favor, and don't buy CD's from sell-outs KoRn,  instead use your money and buy this masterpiece!!
B00000IOSU|4.0|Sarah McLachlan is a very talented artist, this cd is packed with beautifully written, and amazing songs. However the magic begins to die as  they all begin to sound a bit the same. I would definetly recommend this cd  to everyone... it is beyond sensational, however it offers no more then as  I say... soothing, and beautiful music. It does not have any snappy music  to offer to add some change, however you will all be impressed by the works  of art preformed by Ms. McLachlan. Enjoy!
6305903182|3.0|Scream 3 was decent but it's time to pack it in. The movie was some what  predicable and at times felt rushed. it is better than Scream 2 because it  was a little more original, but they should not stretch this series any  further. Neve Campbell proves once again that she is a great actress, she  gives the movie a performance that is worthy of a much better film. David  and Courteny Cox Arquette also gives good performances, and Parker Posey Is  truly a comic eye opener.  Let's hope That this is the last one.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This movie rocks! If you like sci-fi, you'll LOVE this. Vin Diesel, an excellent writer and director himself, makes a wonderful big-screen acting  debut here that puts other his other big hits (i.e. Boiler Room) to shame.  His dymanic character Riddick is a convict who surprises everyone in this  movie, even himself, of the depths of human compassion. Unlike other  people, I thought the plot was excellent, the acting exceptional, and  you've got to love the special effects. Two thumbs up!
B00003CXFG|5.0|I knew from the first time I viewed the trailer to this film, that I would like it.  I saw this film three times in the theater.  This film cost about  $20 million to make and its better than those expensive hollywood films  like Alien Resurection and MIB.  David Twohy is the man.  I knew this from  watching The Arrival.  Vin Diesel plays the coolest bad-guy ever.  Who can  forget those eyes!  They story was good, the cinematography was out of this  world.  Not the mention the rest of the all-star cast.  Keith David whom  was in Platoon, also the voice of the Spawn character.  The cop whom was in  Good Will Hunting and Higher Learning.  I can't wait to own this film and  I'm sure I will watch it on a daily basis.
0790729628|3.0|When will directors leave well enough alone. I haven't read the book  \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\", but everyone loved the  original version of this movie or the director would not have had the  opportunity to do his cut version. Well I like the orignal and I'm glad I  still have the VHS of it because when I bought the DVD and it didn't have  Deckard's narration or the final scene I was truly disappointed. I can only hope this studio comes out with Classic Blade Runner, and the Directors version  goes the way of New Coke.<br /><br />Okay I have had a slight change of heart. After all they at least had the foresight to put at least some version on DVD. To many studios are sitting on their backsides while their incredible movies rot rather than putting them on DVD. I only hope they will show some concern for fans of the theatrical release and put it on DVD as well.
B0000039QA|4.0|Rap music may never be shot down even in the event that it is banned from our society sometime in the late future.  It is certain that for Notorious  B.I.G, there is \\"life after death.\\"  Sadly, Biggie's reign of fame will  only begin after his death.  Like fellow rapper 2 Pac he was killed in his  vehicle after an awards show.  With the help of many friends, this album  makes a bold statement.  After what we've seen from 2 Pac after his death,  it's pretty obvious that he can't be dead.  The number of albums being  released after his death is awesome!  This can only mean good things for  B.I.G.  Mo Money Mo Problems probably explains what is so special about  this CD.  It puts B.I.G and other rappers in their place.  It rekindles the  differences between black and white people to a better extent.  \\"Why must  we let those differences set us apart from each other when we could be  doin' the right thing an understandin' each otha's needs?\\"  These  appropriate use of words come from yes, B.I.G himself.  Hypnotize &amp;  Playa Hater are excellent remedies.  Rap music has just received it's major  wake up call and it's becoming so big that you won't want to stop it.   Leave rap alone and let it become what it should be.  Help it and pick up  some rap records like this one, a record with more substance and style than  all of the boy bands combined.  All of the tunes on this album are worth it  and the impact is everlasting.
6305622825|2.0|I like Sean a lot. I think this movie seems to lower his acting  credentials if compared to his other movies. Also, I don't like the female  lead actress. She is horrible. I just can not read from her acting but what  she reallys feel. Plus, the movie has thousands of twists. Altogether with  her lousy action, it makes me confused so many times. Anyway, I give 2  stars because I expect more from Sean. But, there is nothing to lose to  watch this movie
B00000J7J4|4.0|Not every track is perfect, and for  sure not every track is old Santana from the 70's, but then it's NOT the 70's anymore, so if the guy wants to  move on, that's fine by me.  I've moved on too.<br />I've loved Santana since  I first heard their music in England in 1970 at age 15.  I saw them twice  in London, and I do love, and still listen to, their old stuff.  But I love  this album too - at least most of it. As a generalisation I would say that  perhaps I'd like to have heard more of Santana and less of some of the  guests, but then I can hear his guitar right through it, and, let's be  honest, he didn't make his reputation as a singer.<br />For me, the tracks  that work best are the &quot;latin&quot; ones - (Da Le) Yaleo, Africa  Bamba, Corazon Espinado, but that may be a reflection of my advanced age  and fond memories of Santana's 70's stuff.  I just love the sexy Smooth  (does it count as latin if it's sung in English?)and I freely admit I'd  never heard of Rob Thomas before I heard this.  But I've heard of him now,  and I'll seek out more of his music.  <br />Probably my least favorite track  is Maria Maria, which I find cliched, dull and uninspired, and which was  done to death on the radio.  Do You Like The Way is way too long and gets  kind of lost, although I love Lauryn Hill's voice and I also love Migra,  which sounds kind of Indonesian to me (but then what do I know ! ).<br />Love  of my Life and Wishing it Was are good tracks and again introduced me to  guest artists I knew little about before, and I loved to hear Eric Clapton  and Carlos Santana play together.<br />This album cuts across age barriers as  I know plenty of kids who like it too.  I suspect that it's exposed more  than just this old codger to some new names, and at the same time, it's  given me some of the old stuff I loved too, the soaring, melodic guitar,  fabulous rhythms and - as I don't speak a word of Spanish - the totally  indecipherable lyrics!<br />I hope he's working on another.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd isn't your Kid Rock,Limp Bizkit or another faceless angry poseur band.They have those &quot;cool&quot; and obscene lyrics which have  absolutly no meaning for me.They might be &quot;fun&quot; and fast,but  after listenig to them I feel just empty.I don't want to offend anyones  music tastes,but lyrics of those bands are banal and juvenile and music is  simple and uncreative.On the other hand Pink floyd is meant for people who  REALLY like music.This is a masterpiece done in times when music meant  something,not a product which is going to please masses.Idea to sold this  album as singles is very sad,and speaks much about todays teenagers and MTV  culture.For the last time this is a CONCEPT album ,not bunch of singles  thrown in one bag.This album is about humanity and not how to break  things.Pink Floyd created music with an universal message for all  people,whatever their race,religion,nationality or sexual preference  is.Frat boys like Eminem (who hates women and gays) will be forgotten.Pink  Floyd will live forever...
B000023VR6|5.0|Before the release of Dr. Dre 2001 I disliked rap with a passion. I was  always skeptical at the amount of talent that it took to rhyme along to a  predictable backbeat. That all changed the first time that I listened to  2001. I found myself mesmerized by the lyrics and the inventive melodies.  Although I now find myself skipping some of the weaker songs, there are  only 5 or so of the 22 tracks that I don't listen to.  Not only is Dre an  amazing rapper, but his songwriting talent far surpasses any other big name  gangta' rapper or rap group. This album has also opened my eyes to other  great talents in the rap world such as the Wu-Tang Clan and Eminem.  The  bottom line is that this album is enjoyable even if you haven't enjoyed rap  in the past. Get youself some chronic, blaze it up and flow with Dre's  unmatched lyrical ability.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I never thought that I could possibly enjoy Fight Club more after I saw it in the theater.  I had read the book, read the script, and seen the movie  numerous times.  Nothing prepared me for the DVD.  I own plenty of DVDs and  I have rented quite a few more, but nothing prepared me for the  completeness of this DVD.  It has everything you ever wanted; extra scenes,  great commentary, and behind the scenes mini-documentaries.  Watching this  movie on DVD made it my favorite movie, when it had previously been in the  top ten.
B00004U30D|5.0|I think it is the best movie I have seen during this year besides Anna and the King, and sixth sense. I think this movie is deep. Some people don't  understand it, so they think it does not make sense.
B000001GK9|5.0|As an admirer of the musical gifts of Gustav Mahler and Herbert von Karajan, it seems puzzling that I had misgivings about purchasing this  recording of Mahler's emotionally-wrenching final complete symphony. Part  of it had to do with my admiration for three other recordings of Mahler's  Ninth, including Klaus Tennstedt's 1979 Angel recording with the London  Philharmonic. Of course, the other two are by Leonard Bernstein, including  his 1965 Columbia recording with the New York Philharmonic and live 1979  recording with the Berliner Philharmoniker to benefit Amnesty International  (his 1985 recording with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw cannot compare with  either of its predecessors). Other misgivings had to do with the strange  pairing of Mahler and Karajan. In contrast to his lifelong experience with  such composers as Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, Karajan only started  performing Mahler in earnest during the 1970s. There is also the debate  which fuels anti-Karajan sentiment among those who already dislike his  conducting: whether he joined the Nazi party in his youth because he was an  ardent supporter of Adolf Hitler, or simply to maintain his career. This  would be a moot point, except that Mahler was Jewish, which begs the  question: Could a former member of the Nazi party provide a worthy  performance of a composer whose people lost millions because of that  party's evil policies? Only the recording itself can provide an answer,  which can only depend upon the tastes of individual Mahlerians.<br />Like  Bernstein a few years earlier, Karajan evokes gorgeous playing from the  Berliners. Yet his interpretation does not always have reach the same  intensity as Bernstein's recording with them, as in the climactic moment of  the first movement. The second movement does not seem to have the sense of  irony or transience one tends to associate with Mahler. As he gets into the  third movement, however, Karajan seems closer to the spirit of  (Bernstein's) Mahler, culminating in a transcendentally beautiful fourth  movement.<br />Despite my personal reservations about aspects of Karajan's  interpretation of Mahler's Ninth, this recording is nevertheless  beautifully executed, particularly in the concluding adagio. Whether it be  Bernstein's portrayal of an anguished Mahler or Karajan's portrayal of a  Mahler who has more calmly accepted his mortality (though not without some  protest and apprehension of the beyond), either approach can provide a  profoundly moving experience. While he may not have had the same intensity  or spiritual bond to Mahler that one associates with Bernstein, Karajan  provides a sumptuous account that Mahlerians should seriously consider  adding to their collections. And unless someone has a direct connection to  Mahler, no one should mistaken personal preferences for the composer's  &quot;real&quot; intentions.
0671034065|4.0|I liked the adult tone of this romantic supspense.  The dialogue, tone and sexual encounters were grittier than you find in most romantic suspense.   If you are the hearts and flowers type this may not be for you but if you  like steamy and no-holds barred sex this was a great read.  Ree-views
0140177396|3.0|For the last months we have been reading Of mice and men. It was a  considerably good learning experience but it also had a downside.    I  think that this book had a great deal of things useful for teaching  different literature aspects; quotations, descriptons, themes, etc.  However, this does not mean that i liked the book. Many may have found it  boring to read since it is a slow book, maybe because of its long  descrptions that were irelevant sometimes. I dont want to say its a bad  book, because its not, and there are many people who liked it in my class.     Anyway, i believe it was a good choice for us to read Of mice and men,  since a lot can be learnt as far as skills go.
B00004VW0W|5.0|Yes the album overall is wonderful! Foreigner Suite though takes the cake in category of love song. The words and melodies that flow are as moving as they are buitiful. A must addition to anyone looking for uncondontional love through music.
B000002AHM|4.0|I don't have a WHOLE lot to comment on this disc. I seriously wish I could  have been there, or at least see it on video (i've been told that it was  taped for PBS, if anybody knows anything about it, let me know!) These guys  are playing great, playing fast, with passion, grace, and fire :)  A lot of  people have panned this disc for being too incredibly fast (to which i say,  &quot;oh yeah? listen to the next trio disc! now that's fast!) The point of  this music isn't to be playing with depth and utter intensity: it's a work  of entertainment. Al Di Meola has always especially tried to make live  guitar an exciting experience to all kinds of people, so of course these  guys are playing to the audience, but that's good! I'd recommend to anybody  to see any of these guys live in concert (i hope to see Al and John play  live with their own groups later in the year!). It's really great to listen  to, but I give it only 4 stars because it looses the magic of that night  without the visual experience, which is what it was intended for!
B000002HAJ|5.0|I bought this album about the time it came out (92) and I have never been  so much affected by an album in my life.  I heard of The Cure from a friend  and was persuaded to get it by him.  Believe me when I say I took it  EVERYWHERE I went.....EVERYWHERE.  I was beyond obsessed with it.  I never  heard anything like this in my life.  I was only familiar with mainstream  rock at the time so hearing something like this was so different to me.   Since then I have bought all the Cure releases but this one is most special  to me.  I think this one along with Disintegration are the best.  Robert  Smith is a genius.  To pick a favorite would be impossible the songs are  all fabulous.  The guitar work is amazing especially on &quot;A Letter To  Elise&quot;.  The solo is absolutely riveting.  I can never get tired of  it.  &quot;Wish&quot; was the album made me expand my horizons musically  and not just follow radio tunes.  It all started here with me.
B00000K2SC|5.0|i really liked this movie very,very much,most people say this flick is as original as it can get,but FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW,let me tell you that the  creators of the matrix are japanese animation FANS,they said in an  interview that they were watching some anime movies and series while  writting the script,and by the way the movie plot is and many scenes from  it ,clearly they took parts from GHOST IN THE SHELL,SERIAL EXPERIMENTS  LAIN,and NINJA SCROLL,any anime fan can tell you this.but still what a  great movie.<br />also mission imposible 2 is filled with some scenes from a  video game called metal gear solid.
014017821X|4.0|What a lush and disturbing collection of stories!  My brilliant,  London-dwelling sister lent me her copy and I have been entranced.  Angela  Carter recreates well-known tales like &quot;Bluebeard&quot; with rich,  velvety language and haunting imagery.  <br />Eg. &lt;&lt;&quot;Soon,&quot; he  said in his resonant voice that was like the tolling of a bell as I felt,  all at once, a sharp premonition of dread that lasted only as long as the  match flared and I could see his white, broad face as if it were hovering,  disembodied, above the sheets, illuminated from below like a grotesque  carnival head.  The flame died, the cigar glowed and filled the campartment  with a remembered fragrance that made me think of my father, how he would  hug me in a warm fug of Havana, when I was a little girl, before he kissed  me and left me and died.&gt;&gt;
B00004SCX6|4.0|I became a fan of Britney with her 1st album and eagerly awaited this release. I loved the title track immediately but the rest of the album took  me a few listens to warm too. But now I can honestly say that its an  improvement over her 1st. While ...Baby One More Time had about 5 really  good songs and the rest you skipped this is an album that you can play  almost the whole way through. The only really weak tracks are Satisfaction  and Dear Diary. Satisfaction was a bad move-if she had to do a cover why  not an early Madonna. Dress You Up certainly comes to mind. Dear Diary is  the song Britney wrote not completly awful for her 1st time at song writing  but it sound rather immature.<br />Aside from those 2 songs the rest of the  album is really tight. She especially excells at the upbeat numbers. In  addition to the title track, Stronger, What U See Is What You Get and Lucky  (an excellent choice for the 2nd single) are the standouts. As for the  ballads, Don't let Me Be the Last To Know-the Shania Twain penned song will  probably become a single. However, I prefer Where Are You Now. But both of  these ballads are far superior to From the Bottom of My Broken Heart and  Email My Heart from the 1st album.<br />Brit's singing has been bashed a lot  lately. But I think her voice is perfect for the type of music she sings  and much more engaging than Christina &quot;Wish I were Mariah&quot;  Aguilera's.  <br />The album also succeeds at showing a more mature Britney.  There's no need for her to sing a song like Soda Pop anymore. She's grown  up a bit and she's STRONGER.
6303415571|2.0|You could see the YESSONGS movie in the cinemas, I believe it was 1976,  and it had better sound and more tracks as the video a couple of years  later. Why, Oh Why is it not possible to make a good video and DVD of this  movie. They can get Elvis on stage again nowadays but it's probably to  difficult in the age of computers to remaster and to digitalise this  beautiful concert. Oh, it would be so nice to relive this concert again and  with good sound quality!! Well, I'm still hoping that day will come.
6305728437|4.0|Basically, it comes down to this.  The good things about Mulan - good  songs (esp. Be a Man) witty lines, especially from Mushu, a heroine who can  fight and be tough and isn't sickeningly good, some pretty tough scenes,  like the destroyed village, and good drawing which looks sort of Chinese  but also realistic.  The bad things about Mulan - it's OK for Mushu to  speak like a westerner as you get used to it and accept it, but stuff like  'jerks', 'quit' and 'guys' jars when the other characters say it, also  despite the feminist overtones Mulan still goes home and gets married in  the end.  I knew nothing about the original Mulan story so can't say how it  fares in that respect, but as a Disney movie it's great - much better than  Pocahontas.
6305878323|4.0|this DVD release falls short of the mark by being non-anamorphic,(take note Amazon!) something that is annoying for those of us with widescreen  sets, and an omission on Disney's part that makes me wonder why they  released a widescreen only DVD. The appearance of the movie would have  benefitted from a little more effort from Disney for this second DVD  release of a classic movie. Yes, of course I bought, it because my daughter  loves it, again and again and....
B0000039LE|5.0|HALLOWEEN IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST! Horror movie you can buy.It has the best  storyline out of all the Screams. This movie is a must have!

B00004R99I|2.0|Now don't get me wrong.  Check out my Mulan review and you'll see I like  some Disney.  I adored the Lion King, Aristocats, Aladdin, and the Toy  Storys.  But not this.  The trouble with Pocahontas is that it just isn't  that memorable.  Pocahontas seems dull, not real at all, and John is just  annoying.  Meeko and Percy are ok, as is Thomas, but that's about it.  The  villain isn't either cool or horrible, the only good song is the war song,  Disney took painful historical inaccuracies with the plot - and talking  about plot, what's with the learning each other's language thing in 5  seconds?  And the talking tree (I'm sorry, but she just really annoyed me.)   There's no catchy lines - I think the whole movie was basically dull.
B00001NFCY|1.0|my friend has this cd and he loves it well he had it on in his room one  day and i was like what the heck is this? its the same stuff u hear at  church (nothin` agianst god) but if u want to hear this cd go 2 church its  just about the same stuff! sure 1 of the popular songs might make u want to  buy this cd but dont waste your money for this! (i gave it 1 star cuz  theres no option for 0!!)
B000000W74|4.0|Though true JLH fans probably have found some of his earlier CDs to be a  better reflection of his talents, this is a fun blues CD for those who are  just getting into Blues.  After just a few plays, you'll be humming  &quot;Kiddio&quot; as if you've known it for years.  Hooker's rendition of  &quot;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot; is more likely to get you  doing &quot;air-band&quot; than George Thorogood's version.  Finally, the  title cut (&quot;Chill Out&quot;) is a great piece that should have  received substantially greater attention.  Much of the CD is just Hooker's  voice, a guitar and a tapping shoe, with an occassional piano thrown in,  but a few cuts have a bit more.  Don't let that scare you... this is a good  buy.
B00004RFFM|5.0|I had given up on shark movies after so many imitations of Jaws. This movie changed all of that. As a result of medical experiments a scientific  crew is laid seige by smart sharks. These sharks are scary. With the use of  outstanding special effects the sharks become even scarier. The crew on  this installation is never safe. The actual attacks of the intelligent  sharks are made even more realistic and scary as a result of the special  effects. One by one the crew is disposed of by these intelligent killing  machines. The crew members are hunted until the very end. The remaining  crew members are finally able to kill the final shark. This is a must see  movie. Be sure to see it. It is frightening!
6304711891|5.0|First off we have Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris starring in this action movie.  Nicolas Cage is a &quot;chemical super-freak&quot; who  is directed to go to &quot;The Rock&quot; (Alcatraz) and difuse rockets  armed with VX gas that could take out the whole city of San Francisco.   Sean Connery is an ex-spy from Great Britain who has been held in our  prison system for almost 30 years because he stole microphones and film  that gave him the knowledge of the actual Kennedy assasination and some  other of our secrets and was never charged.  He has been chosen to lead  Cage and Navy Seals into The Rock through the underground drainage system,  because, well, he is the only man to escape!  Ed Harris is a decorated  veteran of the armed forces who was sick of seeing his soldiers die in  Vietnam and the Persian Gulf and not get the proper burial a fallen soldier  deserved.  He stole rockets containing the VX gas and threatens to launch  them at San Francisco if the boys back in D.C. do not meet his demands of  transferring money from various secret accounts so that the families of  these men receive the benefits they have never gotten and the soldiers who  are helping him will get paid and move to non-extradition treaty country so  they will face no charges.<br />What this all adds up to is a great action  flick.  Bruckheimer &amp; Simpson deliver the best movie they have ever put  out (Simpsom passed in the making of the film, god rest his soul) arguably.   The on-screen chemistry between Nicolas and Sean is awesome and offer some  of the best one liners in movie history.  Ed Harris gives a great  performance and plays a great role!  If you have not seen this movie you  are missing perhaps one of the best action films made.  There is some  cheesiness and idiosincricies, but they are small and do not stand out.  As  Nicolas Cage's character Stanley Goodspeed said, Let's cut the chit-chat  A-Hole, buy this movie and watch it over and over again.

B000002J1L|4.0|When reading the jibberish added to the &quot;Lamb lies down on Broadway&quot; album, one learns how incredible is the imagination of Peter  Gabriel.  He wrote not only the jibberish of that album but its extensive  lyrics likewise.  Peter Gabriel is very similar to Frank Zappa and his  imagination really takes off in &quot;Nursery Crime&quot;.  In &quot;The  Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot;, one learns how  the British Royal Family  garden is attacked by a terrible weed imported from Russia.  This song is a  hidden jewel and one has to wonder why these fellows put such effort and  complexity into it.  One day people will fully appreciate the special time  which was the early seventies.  This time produced a huge amount of music  which was both creative and very high quality.  Genesis and its production  of &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;  commemorates this time.

They are both new in the ranch, the place where they work.  There, the men that work with them cannot understand their relationship  since one of them said &quot;I have never seen two guys traveling  together.I never seen  one guy take so much trouble for another guy&quot;.  They also have to face  lots of troubles, includins the murder of the  bosse's  daugther in law. Because of this, george has to kill Lennie, if  not , he would be violently murdered by the girl's husband.   We think that  the book deals , mostly, with loneliness. &quot;Guys like us are the  loneliest guys in the world&quot; This quotation expresses the message that  the author is trying to give us.   Because of all these, we believe that  the book was great.
630468150X|4.0|Well what do we have here, we have Nicolas Cage (Cameron Poe) who is a Ranger returning from a tour of duty.  He meets up with his wife at a bar  she works at and ends up in a fight at the end of the evening in the  parking lot.  He takes on three men defending himself and his wife and  kills one of them.  He is thrown in prison because of his military  background (he poses more of a threat than a normal person in the same  situation).  John Cusack plays a know it all federal agent who is in charge  of making sure the transfer of the most dangerous criminals to a new  maximum security prison goes &quot;smoothly.&quot;<br />Poe is on the plane  because he is a parolee catching a trip home to be with his wife and  daughter.  Little does he know that the criminals are planning on taking  over the plane and they are lead by Cirus the Virus (John Malkovich).  What  this all makes for is an all star cast, great acting, a little cheesiness,  good one liners and maybe a happy ending or the bad guys win?  <br />The only  way to find out is buy this movie and watch it yourself.  It is a  Bruckheimer film, so you got that going for you and should tell you right  there it is worth getting!

6302913896|5.0|Every scene in this fantastic series is overflowing with unconventional  humor, twisted fear, raging evil, and quircky characters. There has never  been a better show on television. From Coopers passion for coffe, cherry  pie, and Tibet, to a guest appearance in drag by David Duchovney, Twin  Peaks offer nothing ordinary. There takes a certain personality to fully  enjoy the humor of this show. I love each and every member of this show.  Lynch was able to capture their simplicity along with their excentricities,  and he opened them up to you as though they were people in your own town.  The question isn't who killed Laura Palmer. If that is all you cared about,  then you missed the purpose of the show. The brilliant mind of David Lynch  gave the world a look into worlds within our world, and dared us to be  scared. He dared us to be a little bit crazy.  To this day, there is no one  in the world who scares me more than BOB.
0140177396|5.0|This is a book that it really make me feel about several emotions To begin  with I firstly thought about dreams I have.  Usually, my dreams are  connected to my future.  So this book make me the next day you are going to  be death or alive, so I learnt with this book, that you have to live your  life as much as you can. It also make me feel about how alone we are in  this word, although we have people who love us.  We live in a society that  don't take in to account the importance of having friends, and a  family.   We are only thinking about what we really care not in the others.    Moreover, there's  a lot of violence, like  that there is  now a  day.<br />Because of all this reasons,  I can say this book will remain as a  classical book because it's main themes are related to what we live.
0451450523|5.0|I have read this book a numerous amount of times and I still learn  something new every time.  It starts out making you think that it's  generally about a unicorn who cannot find others like herself in the world.   A butterfly comes by and tells her that a creature called the Red Bull has  driven all the unicorns into the sea for his owner, King Haggard.  This  unicorn was the last.  So the unicorn sets out on a journey that would  forever change her life.  Along the way, she meets a want-to-be wizard, but  he is only a kindly skinny magician.  And a woman named Molly Grue.  When  finally they reach King Haggard's castle, the Red Bull senses the unicorn's  presence.  The only way the unicorn can escape and save her people is by  turning into something else.  So her magician turns her into a human.  They  get into King Haggard's castle and stay there for a while.  And as the  unicorn becomes more human, she forgets that she was once a unicorn and she  forgets her mission and why she actually came to King Haggard's castle.   And through everything, the unicorn learns to love, cry, and even regret.   And as her last few touching words, she says, &quot;I am the only unicorn  that regrets.  I regret.  And I thank you for that, too.&quot;  It's a must  read for any emotional lover of fantasy.  Or even anyone who isn't.  You'll  love it.  It's an amazing look at the human world of emotions through the  eyes of a creature who has just began to feel them.
0152023984|5.0|Oh my gosh, this book is just so realistic, there just isn't enough words  to describe it.You really have to look beyond the cutecy little adventures  the little prince does, because there are a lot of lessons that we can all  learn from it.<br />  I agree, it isn't really a children's book, although a  child will mostly understand it. I can most definitely find myself and in  what situation i am in,in this book.<br />  As you read the book, you'll  notice that all of the scences in the story are simply metaphors of  everyone's lives. Like for example, the flower that the little prince cared  for so much, can be related as a love relationship, but when the little boy  leaves his flower for her vanity(snobiness)and she tells him to just  &quot;be happy&quot;, you know that was true love right there,and also lets  him know that she was just testing him to see if he was going to give up on  her.So know u know the little prince made a mistake by leaving her, and  throughout the story he mentions her and relates to her.<br />  You will  truelly find yourself in this story and it will remind you of all things  you've been through in your life, and things you will go through. You have  to lelate this book to life when you read it, otherwise, it's just a lil  children's book.<br />  Oh and by the way, my French teacher thought this  was the best book in her whole life and wanted to read this to us, and  after every chapter, we talk about what the story meant and it's amazing  how every single person can really relate to it, and interpret it in his or  her own way.She tells us she's read this 20 times, and everytime she reads  it, she finds something new.  It's just like a poem, you're never wrong  and there's diff situations behind it and applies to us all. the book is  also an eye-opener to me, because it makes you realize how vain the world  can be at times, and most grown ups are to blame for letting that happen.<br />  Overall, this book is about relationships for the most  part,love,friendship,even vanity and alcoholism, and how making the wrong  choice can hurt you permanently. It is a book about life...ips for the most  part,love,friendship,even vanity and alcoholism, and how making the wrong  choice can hurt you permanently. It is a book about life...
6300182770|5.0|Videodrome is one of the most important films ever made and David  Cronenberg is the most socially relevent director of the last thirty-five  years.<br />Cronenberg's ideas and imagry can be unsettling, to be sure, but  then technology is unsettling. It is altering us in ways we cannot even  begin to understand. Videodrome taps into some of these notions.<br />Consider  that Videodrome was made in about 82 or 83, when video was very new. No  other filmmaker has offered such an incisive commentary, before or since,  on television violence, not being able to &quot;take your eyes off the  screen&quot; as James Woods says in the movie, and on the coming global  village, as predicted by Marshall Macluhan (sp?). <br />The images in this  film are revolutionary. And with the advent of reality shows like American  High and Big Brother and Real TV and (less recently) the real world, this  film becomes all the more relevent. <br />Why can't we take our eyes off the  screen?  Why are we driven to watch rather than to live in the real  world?<br />These are the questions posed by Cronenberg. <br />Make no mistake,  this film is not for everyone. Many will find it unremittingly dour and  disgusting. My girlfriend despised it with a passion. <br />But for those  willing, Videodrome is a valuable film.

B00004TL21|4.0|This is the first Deftones album I have ever bought, or for that matter  heard!  I know, where the heck have I been?  Well, not listening to the  Deftones!  I thought I made that quite clear.  Anyway, this album is like  sticking your finger in an open socket and letting a 120 volts latch onto  your hand and move across your skin and dive into your blood stream...   Yes, it's just that heavy and powerful.  &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, the 2nd  track and the 2nd best song on the c.d., is so graceful and churning.  It  goes from such a quiet, melodic verse, to a pulsating chorus that I  immediantly knew I was on to something good.  But the stand out track, #10,  &quot;Change (in the house of flies)&quot; does something that I have been  waiting a long time for a song to do.  It starts obviously with a verse and  then jumps into this crunching, raw riff for a chrous, then another verse  and chorus, and then it proceeds to built up an even higher platue of rock  after that 2nd chorus that literally made me stand up when I heard it.  It  was as if one of those cartoon ghost hands that lead people was waving it's  hand to move in closer to the stereo.  It made my hairs stand on up.  And  in a way that is what the whole c.d. does.  It sits quiet for a minute and  then gradually pulls you in with building levels of intesity.
B000002H33|5.0|MASTER OF PUPPETS is classic Metallica in all its glory.  This album rates  3rd in the all-time Metallica sweepstakes, behind RIDE THE LIGHTNING and  the BLACK ALBUM, and contains a number of Metallica's best signature songs.  The CD opens with the slower back and forth of chords and rhythms played  without distortion, and slowly grows into the speed-rush that is Battery.  Though Battery's words are difficult to understand, the energy that the  song delivers is unmistakeable, and just as the song says, &quot;Cannot  stop the Battery&quot;.  The title track follows, and is one of the  all-time greatest songs.  An epic about the use of cocaine, Master of  Puppets combines lyrical brilliance with musical genius.  The knockdown  thrash sound of the first 3 1/2 minutes gives way to an ear-pleasing and  musically intriguing instrumental section complete with one of Kirk's most  melodius solos, with a steady rhythmic undertone of Cliff's bass and Lars  on the drums.  This section flows right back into the heart of thrash that  is the Kirk's trademark blitz solo.  THe next track is a very interesting  song, The Thing that Should Not Be, which is quite underrated.  Nice  lyrics, that can actually be understood, for the most part, combine with  well done basslines to make this song a welcome addition to the cd.  The  4th track, Sanitarium, is one of the bands most moving.  About the tortures  suffered in an asylum and the inmates desires to escape, the song runs at a  much slower pace, and is muysically reminiscent of Fade to Black, off the  LIGHTNING album.  Sanitarium's guitar solo at the end is another Hammet  masterpiece.  Disposable Heroes is a much undervalued Metallica song about  sending young soldiers off to die.  Though not as musically appealing as  some of the other tracks, Disposable Heroes has some nnof the bands most  poignant lyrics.  Leper Messiah is a little weak, and mildly repetive, but  still worth the listen.  Orion, an instrumental written chiefly by bassist  Cliff Burton, is intriguing and has a cool military march section which  makes this song truly fit.  The whole album wraps up with one of the band's  heaviest and most flat out aggressive songs, Damage Incorporated.  The  guitar work on this track are lightning quick, and truly amazing.  On the  whole, this album is a must have for Metallica fans, and trendy metal heads  alike, but it's true value is in the first 5 songs, which may present one  of the greatest groups of five ever.bassist  Cliff Burton, is intriguing and has a cool military march section which  makes this song truly fit.

B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic for the People is without a doubt in my mind the best single  recording for any music artest in the 90's.  I think that is saying quite  alot.  Automatic is R.E.M.s recording that sets them apart from just being  a standard alternative guitar rock band.  Not that the older R.E.M. rock  and roll records are bad at all, but Automatic really shows the bands depth  of musical styles.  The CD starts with Drive which is a slow mystic look at  restless youth and the need to grow.  Stipes voice in this tune still  haunts me to this day.  Almost all of tracks 2-10 are reflections of  growing old and even death.  Sweetness Follows allmost qualifys as a  funural durge.  Evryone knows the message of Everybody Hurts,  Hold on just  Hold on.  In these trying times we need to hear that from someone and where  better than popular music.  The true greatness of this CD flows from the  final track though.  Find the River is a song of feeling hopeless, lost, in  need of a friend, and in the final verse lies a felling of hope, if not  victory that helps you to cope with allmost anything.  R.E.M.s Automatic  for the people will touch anyone going through a dark and difficult time.   The felling really comes out here in the music, I sugest everyone listen to  this Gem sometime.
6303421563|5.0|If it weren't for &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; this would be my all-time favorite movie! I don't care what anyone says this movie is near flawless!  Jean Reno plays a expert hitman, named Leon, working in the mean streets of  NYC, who just loves his milk. The apartment building where Leon lives is  co-habitated by some other interesting characters. Namely a young girl  named Mathilda, played fantastically by Natalie Portman in her screen  debut. Little Mathilda, unfortunately lives with her abusive sister,  neglective mother, innocent young brother, and drug dealer father. When her  father crosses a drug lord, played by Gary Oldman(Is there a better bad guy  alive than him! ), the drug lord murders Mathilda's family, including  her toddler brother. Leno witnesses the act, and decides to take the girl  into his life. She soon learns of his trade as a &quot;cleaner&quot;, and  demands that Leon teach her how to &quot;clean&quot; so that she may avenge  the death of her younger brother. Leon reluctantly agrees, and soon the two  are caught up in a situation so deep that will change their lives forever.  The film is scored brilliantly by Eric Serra, and Luc Besson moves this  compelling tale at break neck speed, whilst all th ewhile not forgetting to  mix in humor, drama, and some pretty spectacular action scenes. My personal  favorite is when Leon attacks the NYPD SWAT team by hanging upside down  from the ceiling. The development of the two characters during thi  smagnificent ride is quite touching, as Leon goes from a temporary savior,  to a reluctant guardian, to a father type figure. There was even a spot  where Leon is trying to get the girl to escape, and she won't go because he  can't follow, that almost had me in tears. This is a great film, and it  should defintely be worth your time. At the very least, see it for Gary  Oldman's show-stealing performance. This guy should own several Oscars in  my book! Well there is nothing more to say except that you should see this  film because not only does it work on every level, it EXCEEDS those levels.this  film because not only does it work on every level, it EXCEEDS those levels.
B000001ESJ|5.0|The Rush CD A Farewell to Kings could very well be the bands greatest  theme CD.  The band captures Rock and Roll storytelling at its best.  The  bands mastery of this musical storytelling really shines through on this  CD.  With so many Rock and Roll Records taking this path at this time, take  Pink Floyd for example, I think A Farewell to Kings is often  overlooked.<br />Take the begining of this CD, the gentle guitar into the  thrashing rhythems of Neal Pearts drum kit and Geddy Lees Electric Bass.   Its a tale of Heros, or lack there of.  Its a stroy of the common man, the  union worker that strugles to make ends meet.  Such a fantastic CD, every  Rock fan should enjoy.
0553328255|5.0|In Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created one of the world's best  known and (arguably) most fully realized literary characters. Since Doyle's  death, there have been plenty of people writing knockoffs of his stories.  But with rare exceptions (Nicholas Meyer comes to mind), most have not  lived up to the high standards Doyle set in at least the best of his Holmes  tales.<br /><br />This volume includes the complete canon of Doyle's original  stories -- four novels and fifty-six short stories, from &quot;A Study in  Scarlet&quot; to &quot;His Last Bow.&quot; While there are a handful of  cases that bore significantly on international affairs (e.g. &quot;The  Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;), most of them are of interest simply because  of that touch of the _outre_ that Holmes loved so much and that provided  such stimulating material to the ideal reasoner.<br /><br />There are some  clunkers in the canon, of course, but the vast majority of these stories --  especially the earliest ones -- are just brilliant. If you are reading them  for the first time, I envy you; the sturdy Dr. John Watson is about to  introduce you to a new world, a world of Victorian gaslight and  Stradivarius violins, of hansom cabs and cries of &quot;The game's  afoot!&quot;<br /><br />For in reading this volume you will find such classic  tales as &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; and &quot;The Man With The  Twisted Lip&quot;; you will encounter the famous dog that did nothing in  the night-time (&quot;Silver Blaze&quot;) and several versions of Holmes's  favorite maxim (&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever  remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot;); and you will meet  one of the most fascinating and memorable characters ever to spring from  the printed page: Holmes himself.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, you will  catch a glimpse of the world as an ideal reasoner might see it -- not as a  grab-bag of random atomic facts in which our own role is negligible, but as  a vast interconnected whole in which each part bears some necessary  relation to the rest, and in which the reasoned pursuit of justice in all  matters great and small is the business of each and every one of  us.<br /><br />Incidentally, the twentieth-century philosopher who presented that  vision most consistently and cogently is, to my own mind, Brand Blanshard,  and any Holmes readers who are interested in philosophy may enjoy  investigating Blanshard's works as well.igible, but as  a vast interconnected whole in which each part bears some necessary  relation to the rest, and in which the reasoned pursuit of justice in all  matters great and small is the business of each and every one of  us.<br /><br />Incidentally, the twentieth-century philosopher who presented that  vision most consistently and cogently is, to my own mind, Brand Blanshard,  and any Holmes readers who are interested in philosophy may enjoy  investigating Blanshard's works as well.

6305358567|3.0|&quot;Elizabeth&quot; certainly got a lot of attention when it was  released in 1998. After finally seeing the movie, I wonder how many of the  voices applauding it actually understood what was going on! <br />The plot  (such as it is) simply covers the first few years of Elizabeth I's reign  &amp; the political machinations of the great magnates who surrounded her.  For someone familiar with Tudor history it is an enjoyable re-creation of a  world glimpsed dimly thru the portraits of Hans Holbein &amp; others. For  those who did not study their English history, I suspect this film might be  incomprehensible. The Dukes, Earls, Bishops &amp; other powerful men who  make up Elizabeth's court are not introduced in any way in the film. They  wear similar hair cuts, facial hair &amp; clothing so as to make them  difficult to identify upon entering a scene. The political motives of those  who choose to support the Pope over Church of England (which was different  from Protestantism) are not shown, nor is any clarity thrown of Mary de  Guise's role. She is simply portrayed as a meddlesome seductress, &amp; the  screen writers seem to have confused her with Mary Queen of Scots (her  daughter).<br />Of course, Cate Blanchett is luminous as Elizabeth. She  certainly deserves all the accolades that were heaped upon her &amp; it  will be hard to ever picture Elizabeth I as looking any other way. Joseph  Fiennes as Dudley  does not share the resemblance to his historical  counterpart, &amp; I find him too modern to be believable. The interiors  are dark &amp; gloomy, which is a shame as the design seems to be  excellent. It is obvious the director wanted the spotlight on his actors,  not his scenery!<br />Personally, I found the ending ruined the rest of the  movie for me. It has no basis in history, &amp; does not even seem logical  based upon the script thus far. It is nothing more than a simplistic way to  bring a conclusion where none exists. Watch &quot;Elizabeth&quot; forproduction &amp; acting, you'll probably be lost by the story anyway!
0517122707|2.0|Based on the reviews contianed at this web site, I bought this book as a  summer read.<br />While the characters are fascinating, the humor is  practically non-existant. It seems that this book has become a sort-of  &quot;cult classic&quot;. And like most cult classics, it's really not as  good as most people make it out to be. I mean, is the Rocky Horror Picture  Show that good? No. But it is a cult classic.<br />There are indeed some  colorful characters in the French Quarter and in this book, and Toole  captures their idiosyncratic behavior pretty well. And he does an  exceptional job of capturing the language spoken by the locals. But to call  this collection of semi-humorous vignettes a comic masterpiece is a cruel  hoax on readers. <br />In my opinion, this is another example of a person  becoming famous for his work by dying, preferably in a tragic (Toole  commited suicide) way.<br />To qoute another reviewer, &quot;This is an  example of how a nondescript work can become so inflated by the great  American hype-machine as to finally emerge as some sort of accepted  masterwork, never to be equalled, unparalleled. I'm surprised Toole wasn't  posthumously awarded the Nobel as well.&quot; <br />Fortunately, the Nobel  prize is never awarded posthumously.

0790734850|5.0|I can't believe I hadn't seen this film until recently! This is one of the most intelligent and original dark comedies I have ever seen! It is a tale  of corruption -- police, politicians and the press -- and the people  involved. Set in Hollywood during the 1950's, the film illustrates police  corruption. There are many phony policemen, one of whom is Kevin Spacey's  character. He sells information to a sleazy tabloid journalist (played by  Danny Devito). The backdrop of the film sort of reminds me of Chinatown --  the best Technicolor noir film I have ever seen. The actors are incredible.  Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito are amazing, as are Russell Crowe and Guy  Pearce. But the real treat in this film is Kim Basinger; she earned that  Academy Award. This is a compelling and brutally honest thriller that  should definitely be owned. I highly recommend this film, especially on  DVD.
B000002BUY|5.0|I admit, after first purchasing the album, i was kind of tentative and weary about their style.  But i must say, this album has grown on me as  much as any Tool album.  It is SUCH a good detraction from the almost  overpacked, downtrodden music that is on the rock-radio today.  Sevendust,  Tool, Helmet *rip*, A Perfect Circle, NIN, Soulfly, etc are all killer  *dare i say* 'rock' bands, and I feel incubus definitely has a unique place  in this category.  <br />Like Mindless Self Indulgence *a mindblowing 3-person  ensemble*, their music can be difficult to categorize....  from the *dare i  say* rap-metal &quot;Redefine&quot; to the 1972-esque pimp-shoe, feather  hat &quot;Antigravity Lovesong&quot;, to the poppy &quot;Favorite  things&quot;, to Trip-hop &quot;Magic Medicine&quot; and the hidden  track.... They cover quite a few musical genres, just as Sublime  did.<br />Jose Pasillas is quite a fantastic set player, along with the other  instrumentalists of the ensemble, they're all very talented.  <br />Brandon  Boyd's voice can at times make you wonder &quot;Do you want some cheese  with your Whine?&quot;, but like I said, the album WILL grow on you and you  won't care... I guess you could find a parallel of this to any Jewel  album... her voice is piercing, but can be enjoyed.<br />Being a percussionist  myself, I did enjoy the occassional djembe licks from Brandon.  I feel they  were tastily performed, keeping time/rhythm with scratches, occassional  solos, and an extra 'voice' in the ensemble.<br />My choice for Varietous  Album.  It's a must listen.
B000002NJS|4.0|Madonna has managed to manipulate the media with her outspoken nature and undeniable wit. She has also kept people in suspense by constantly changing  her look. People have wanted her career to end, but she is still around and  will be around for a long time. Also, some Madonna fans aren't sure that  they like her new sound. Do not underestimate Madonna, for she has always  managed to surprise us.<br />Ray of Light is the most artistic and creative  album Madonna has ever recorded. Instead of trying a new look (although she  did), she decided to try a new sound. Ray of Light is filled with  electronic music and edgy dance songs. The result is brilliant. Her voice  is stronger than ever and her sound is a lot more refined -- very different  from the pop ditties she recorded in the past. Yes, she is not as outspoken  as she used to be, but then again she has evolved as a person and as an  artist. I love &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot;; the lyrics are very  touching. I also like &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; &quot;Frozen,&quot;  &quot;Nothing Really Matters,&quot; and &quot;Skin.&quot; The songs have a  common theme: spirituality and self-discovery.<br />I urge you to purchase  this incredible CD. And for all of you reluctant Madonna fans out there:  Madonna is better than ever. Give this CD a whirl.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|&quot;Pinocchio&quot; was Walt Disney's second animated feature, and it is  his greatest triumph. It has memorable characters, timeless animation, and  great songs, including the Oscar-winning &quot;When You Wish Upon A  Star.&quot; Cliff Edwards {the voice of Jiminy Cricket} sings that song in  the opening credits with such brilliance that it makes you feel alive.  Dickie Jones was a magnificent fit for the voice of Pinocchio. He was 12  years old when he did the voice, but, to me, he sounded younger than that.  Walt Disney should be proud of himself for making this timeless  masterpiece, and he made lots of them, including &quot;Dumbo&quot; and  &quot;Bambi.&quot; They don't make these kinds of movies anymore, which is  both a tragedy and a travesty.
B000002J1B|5.0|Geddy Lee of Rush was asked what album he would take to a desert island if  he could only take one album. He said Relayer. When such a progressive rock  insider as Geddy says that, you know you've got an awesome album on your  hands. And what an awesome album Relayer is. I find myself splitting hairs  trying to decide whether this or the Yes Album is the band's best release  (although most all of them are masterpieces). This is a different album  from the others, for several reasons. For one, it is the only Yes release  to feature Patrick Moraz on keyboards, and he give a breathtaking  performance. On the Gates of Delirium especially he shows his considerable  talents. Also, this is a harder rocking album than all other Yes releases.  If a person heard only this album and no others from the band, they might  very well pigeonhole Yes as a hard rock group. Progressive, of course, but  hard rock still. This album also houses, in my opinion at least, Steve  Howe's best ever performance on guitar. All three songs are very good.  Gates is a masterpiece: the swirling guitar/keyboard solo section is  mesmerizing, but the whole piece is great. Sound Chaser is a great track  also, Howe's guitar solo is masterly and again we get great work from  Moraz. Chris Squire shines on that track as well. To Be Over features more  excellent music and band interplay. An excellent album, possibly the band's  best.
0345350499|5.0|This book is the best thing that ever happened to me. Thecharacters are 3-dimensional and beautiful. The setting is realistic and enchanting. But most of all, I loved reading about the conflict between new and old religions, Christianity and Goddess worship. This is essentially the main struggle in the book. It made me realize that I was not on the right path for me. It made me think about life and death. And made me see the beauty in the world around me...
0064431274|3.0|Being a huge fan of Eric Carle and a kindergarten teacher, I was fairly  disappointed with this book....it needs words!  The only words found in the  book are in two speech bubbles.  At one time, these pictures were published  in a Big Book that included text entitled &quot;Will You Be My  Friend?&quot;.  Early readers need simple text they can follow - not just  pictures.
0312853238|5.0|Ender's Game is one of the most popular science fiction books of all time. Had it received enough media attention (or were it written today), it would  have almost certainly garnered as much (or more!) hype as Harry Potter.  Don't make the mistak, though! Ender's Game is not a children's book,  despite the fact that most of its characters are children - the deeply  questionable ethical discussions, the overall message and trimmings of the  book may confuse children, or simply pass over their heads.<br />An unprepared  Earth has been target of a sudden, devastating attack by the mysterious  alien Buggers, and to prevent it from happening twice, the command of Earth  has been seized by the military. Thus, Earth is unified - for now. The  military is examining and collecting especially bright children for  advanced military training for important military positions. The training  takes place at the top-secret Battle School - an enourmous orbiting  complex. But Andrew Wiggin - Ender - is special. For some reason, the  teachers single him out. He is grouped with inept platoons for the mock  battles. Teachers try to goad him into falling over the brink, breaking  down his moral values, his sense of pity and commiseration. In other words,  they are making him into a perfect weapon - Earth's only hope for the final  battle against its alien invaders.<br />Why is Ender's Game so successful?  Because Card created one of the most appealing central characters the world  has ever seen: Ender is young (don't you want to re-experience childhood?),  he is amazingly intelligent (don't you think of yourself as intelligent?),  and the entire world is out to get him (self-explanatory). Never mind that  the convoluted train-of-thought passages are often discussions of complex  ethical dilemmas, and that the answers that Card achieves may surprise or  shock you. Never mind the appaling lack of imagery, the low number of  well-developed characters, cliche aliens, and some very questionable  scientific premises. Ender's Game is all about your ability to associate  with Ender. By the book's end you will be ready to die for him if needs  be.<br />The chapters increase the pace, bit by bit. The epilogue is truly  stunning. It sets you up with royal hopes for the remainder of the books in  the series. Alas, that path is strewn with disappointments :(
6304578482|5.0|This is the best high school movie that I have ever seen! I started having all of these memories of when I was in high school as I was watching this  movie. So much of the stuff that happened in this movie has happened to me  throughout my high school years. It is the first realistic high school  comedy that I have ever seen, and I recommend it to anyone. For an R rated  movie, it really wasn't that bad. There were a few &quot;F words&quot; and  some very mild sex talk, but that was it. It could have easily got a PG-13  rating if it had had some trimmings here and there. Anyways, great movie!  Rent it! I know that I will BUY it!
068818071X|5.0|I read this book a few months ago after much internet hunting trying to  find it so I didn't have to wait for its US release. <br />While Keyes'  previous works have also dealt with serious subjects, they were underlying,  not at all the main topic in the book.  This book, however, takes a hard  look at addiction.  While she does it with humor, she doesn't necessarily  sugarcoat it.  I especially appreciated that it was the main character's  point of view the story was coming from.  This book is written in first  person, which I like, but at first you may find it rather disconcerting.   The story coming directly from Rachel helped me to relate to what addiction  is like, how hard it is to overcome.  In the beginning, I actually found  myself truly wondering if she was an addict.  That kind of scares me.  It  told me why addicts have such a hard time overcoming.<br />I don't want to  scare anyone off in making them think that this is an depressing, deep book  filled with sorrow and woe.  It's not.  It's very funny at times.  I love  the way the family interacts.  I think they're a lot like most families,  just most families would never admit it.  If you've read Watermelon then  you've already been introduced to the family, if you haven't, read it.  It  doens't really matter which one you read first.  Just enjoy them.
6300208591|5.0|Most critics consider the soulful &quot;La Strada&quot; to be Federico Fellini's masterpiece, but for just plain entertainment nothing beats  &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. From the opening shot of the hovering Christ  statue suspended from a helicopter blessing the City of God to the final  close-up of the Umbrian angel gazing after the debauched hero (literally  stranded very much like Zampano in &quot;La Strada') &quot;La Dolce  Vita&quot; has one scene after another to fascinate on the first viewing or  to anticipate time and again. I'm sure everyone has his favorite sequence:  the sex goddess wading in the Fontana di Trevi, the giggling children  leading a gullible crowd to a&quot;vision&quot; of the Virgin Mary, or the  beach house orgy which climaxes this study of jet-set corruption.  Corruption is the key word here, and the movie was critized for saying  &quot;tsk tsk&quot; to its characters while exploiting their depravity. The  cast (or type-cast) is headed by Marcello Mastroianni as Marcello, a  bachelor who is catnip to females. Anita Ekberg, a Swedish-born American  movie star, plays ... a Swedish-born American movie star! On a sadder  level, Lex Barker, a washed-up Tarzan, plays a washed-up Tarzan. The plot  consists of Marcello's affairs with a succession of beauties, including  Anouk Aime as a jaded heiress who drifts in and out of Marcello's life,  and Yvonne Furneaux as his mistress, pathetically attempting domesticity in  an unfurnished apartment. Between beds, Marcello wanders around viewing  Roman fever in various locales: a Renaissance castello, a tacky night club,  and the Via Veneto, crowded with celebrities and sports cars. Rarely has  decadence looked so attractive, photographed in black-and-white wide screen  and hopped- up by Nino Rota's nervous music. (Incredibly, I can't find a  video cassette in letter-box format.) Marcello is a journalist who  specializes in tabloid scandal stories. His sidekick is a ruthlessly  aggressive photographernamed Paparazzo -- his plural is  &quot;paparazzi&quot;. An intellectual acquaintance named Steiner  (hauntingly played by Alain Cuny) encourages Marcello to pursue more  serious writing, but it is Steiner's incomprehensible act of destruction  that finally sends Marcello over the edge, causing him to fall headlong  into the sweet life which becomes increasingly &quot;acida&quot;. Fellini  shows the lassitude and futility of these beautiful but blank lives, the  characters bored and, yes, basically boring. So why is the story so  engrossing? I think it's because the director never repeats himself; every  sequence is a variation on the same theme. Fellini, fascinated by the  circus, knew how to hold an audience's attention; and in &quot;La Dolce  Vita&quot; he has all three rings going at once: a tremendous life force,  degeneration, and (in the closing shot of the innocent girl's face) hope.  All you have to do is sit back with a glass of Chianti and enjoy the show.
0671034065|4.0|Jaine Bright has lived in her new home for two weeks and considers her next door neighbor the blight of the neighborhood. So she refers to him as  &quot;the Jerk&quot;.  She thinks he is a surly, nasty drunk and sparks fly  when they encounter each other.  So she thinks of his attitude when she and  three of her friends put together a list of requirements for &quot; Mr.  Perfect&quot;.   Jaine and her friends meet every Friday at Ernie's, a  local restaurant, for dinner. After a long and difficult work week, the  friends kick back and discuss their imperfect love lives.  As the  conversation picks up Marci writes down the list of requirements.  An act  that will come back to haunt them.  Thinking no harm will come of an  innocent funny list, Marci shows the list to a co-worker and on Monday  morning, &quot;the list&quot;, as it becomes known, is printed in the  workplace newsletter.  It spreads like wildfire throughout their company  and shows up on the Internet.  It is picked up by local newspapers and  eventually the national news.  What's starts out as an innocent joke turns  deadly when one of the friends is murdered.  Jaine turns to her  &quot;jerk&quot; neighbor for help. Turns out &quot;the jerk&quot; is a  police detective named Sam Donovan. I was delighted that for this book,  Linda has returned to the style of writing that made her so popular.  This  romantic suspense has enough romance to keep readers of the genre  interested.  Sam Donovan and Jaine Bright are two of Linda's most likeable  characters.  Sam is brash, cocky, arrogant, smart, sexy, sweet and not too  shy!!  Jaine is gutsy, intelligent, cute, and a smart mouth with a great  sense of humor.  Oh, and desperate to stop cussing!!  The sparks fly  between these two and their dialogue is often very sexy.   Linda has added  a new element to her writing and it is humor, which works well in this  story.  Now my reason for the four star rating--I was disappointed with the  love scenes.  I have come toexpect very sexy, sensual and erotic love  scenes from Linda but they were not to be found in this book.  I felt the  few scenes she did include in her story were too rushed and not of the  classic standard as in past books.  But that aside, I found this book well  worth the hardcover price and definitely a keeper.

0679746048|4.0|Susanna Kaysen  in Girl, Interupted provides several fascinating and  thought-provoking ideas and thoughts on the anatomy of near-madness, in a  the form of this slightly jumpy book.  The skips from time to time and  subject to subject between chapters in a slightly unorthodox way of telling  a chronological tale can be a teensy bit difficult, but are well worth it  for the insight and general good read provided.  At times funny, at others  serious, Girl, Interupted shouldn't be missed, if only for the candid and  refreshing takes on diagnosed insanity it provides.
B000001ZS4|5.0|As far as electronic music and all of the derivates this album represents  a significant point in time. This is the album I would recommend as a  lecture number one for everybody who is new to this genre. For me this was  a revelation. Up until then I was never really able to say what kind of  music gives me the thrill. Jean-Michel Jarre`s Equinoxe gave me a whole new  perspective. This is the kind of sound that I was strongly attached to both  mentally and emotionally. Highly meditative and thought provoking, creative  and inspirational, this album maintains its value even in the techno era.   Finally, the most important thing about Jean Michel Jarre opus is that you  can observe it and find details you have never heard before, years after  listening to it for a first time.
6305905401|1.0|Polanski, probably one of the most talented directors of the 20th Century, draws you in to this Demonic tale with sheer brilliance.  It's not until  the end that you realize that the ride was hardly worth it.  Kinda like  riding a rollercoster only to realize that the cart detatches at the end.   Depp  is not nearly as evil as he can be, plus the characters that surround  him, though intriguing, are downright as confusing to the viewer.  It's not  a secret that Mr. Polanski has made some great films, as Rosemary's Baby  STILL looks good today even when it shows up on late nite TV.  Also, the  $100+ pricetag? Forget it.  Buy &quot;Rosemary&quot; and go out for a  dinner instead.
0453007902|5.0|This review goes for the audio cassettes.  Gary Sinise's voice is really  incredibly versatile and convincing.  I was amazed by the emphasis in his  Crook's monologue &quot;Books ain't no good... A guy needs someone to be  near'm...&quot;.  Also George's &quot;Guys like us are the loneliest guys  in the world...&quot; and of course Lennie's and old Candy's.  Such  different characters and he can display such a variety and richness of  detail in the voices for each of them.  Really something to hear.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is one of those albums that you hit play and you don't touch the cd  player until its over, only to hit play again. It is impossible to get  tired of hearing Brubeck's delicate style of piano accompanied with  Desmond's honey sweet sax solos backed up by perfect tempo of the swinging  drums by Morrello and the most sticking bass lines around by Wright. I am a  huge jazz fan and if you are too, then you know what I am talking about and  if your not and have an interest towards jazz, start it off right with this  album.
B00004XMVL|5.0|We are always intrigued by the idea of life on other planets, but what if we found a planet that has 3 suns and only gets dark once every 50 years?   What if you come across a human settlement that, during the last eclipse,  everone just disappeared?  What if the next eclipse is within hours of  finding this settlement?  What if, during these periods of darkness, the  inhabitants of the planet come from underground in search of food?  What if  you are the food and there's nowhere to hide?  What do you do?<br />Pitch  Black is full of great special effects, high action sequences that puts you  on the edge of your seat and scares you out of your chair.  You'll be  chearing for the bad guy and booing the good guy.  You will also find that  running and hiding wont save you.  It's a great twist to see a movie done  almost entirely in pitch black surroundings.  If you purchase or just rent  this movie, make sure you can see in with surround sound and watch it in  the dark.  You'll get a feel of actually being there!  I haven't had a  movie make me jump like this one did since the first Alien came out (saw it  the 2nd week after it came out).
B000002J1B|5.0|I loved this record from day 1. Gates of Delirium is like nothing else  ever made in the history of Rock. (If you can call it Rock)Headphones and  loud volume are a must to catch all the subtleties of the song. Every time  I listen to it, the song sounds different.The bass line, the guitar,  keybords all seem to be doing something different that somehow blend  together admirably.<br />Sound chaser and soon are also very  good.<br />Definitively, one of all-time rock masterpieces.
B000002KAT|5.0|I first purchased Astral Weeks about 15 years ago, when it started showing up on critics' lists of the best albums in rock history. The descriptions  that drew me to it -- words like &quot;unique&quot; and  &quot;unconventional&quot; -- turned out to be both right on the mark and  woefully inadequate. <br />Even the word &quot;masterpiece&quot; doesn't work.  Try &quot;transcendence.&quot;<br />I've always felt that you have to listen  to this album all at once. It is most definitely a suite; a ride through a  strange, twisted neighborhood, and your tourguide is a very observant but  slightly disturbed Irish guy. This album definitely takes you somewhere  else, and when it's over, the good feeling usually lingers for a while. In  that way, it's sort of like an audio narcotic. Shoot this in your ears and  get ready to take a ride.
0792844882|5.0|Calling Showgirls &quot;poorly acted&quot; or &quot;sexist&quot; completely misses the point; it's like accusing Britney Spears of not being  a &quot;real musician,&quot; as though you've discovered something.<br />Of  *course* Showgirls is exploitative and demeaning to women.  Almost all  Hollywood movies are demeaning to women.  Almost all of them are  male-written, male-directed male fantasies. But most of them cover this  fact with a thin veneer of &quot;empowerment&quot; and  &quot;sensitivity,&quot; making perfunctory, surface concessions to  political correctness.  It's hypocritical, dishonest and has horrible  long-term effects on the psyches of young impressionable girls (and boys).   The brilliance of Showgirls is that it gathers all of the worst Hollywood  masculine excess and throws it unapologetically in our faces. The movie is  straight-from-the-id, primal, brutish male fantasy.  Every woman in the  movie is a laughable caricature who advances, if at all, by deceiving other  women and becoming a sexual object for men.  The &quot;heroine,&quot; Nomi,  crosses every line, sells every shred of dignity, physically assaults her  female competitors, sleeps with her boss (in the most over-the-top sex  scene in cinematic history), gets her best friend raped... and at the end  of the film, claims that she has gambled and won &quot;herself.&quot;  This  tragi-comic nod to empowerment is a slap to the face of anyone who's been  paying attention.<br />Whether Esterhauz and Verhoeven intended it as such,  Showgirls is at once a camp classic and a sly satire, an example of  everything our culture at once wallows in and disavows.  Sure, you can  react with righteous indignation, waggle your finger at the movie, and pat  yourself on the back for being so enlightened.  But maybe you should take a  look around, at the billboards, the commercials, the sitcoms, the movies,  the music videos, your own prejudices... and think about whether you can't  find a better target.

Mr. Albom captivates the reader from the beginning &amp; never lets  him/her go.  Definately the best book I have ever read.  The movie was also  a very well-written adaptation of the book...everything I imagined it to  be.  A difficult feat to accomplish for most books-turned-to-movies.

B00000IOSU|5.0|Though I have listened to what I consider folk music and singer/songwriter music such as David Wilcox and James Taylor, I would have never really  considered listening to music by Sarah.  I had heard a few of the songs on  the radio and though I thought they were good, they didn't rate with the  likes of Mr Wilcox and Taylor.  Then, a very good friend of mine sent me  this CD, thinking that I would enjoy the words to her music and could find  some solace in them.  I can say now, that I am a true fan.  The stirring  emotions of &quot;Hold On&quot;, and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;, are  truly hypnotic!  Simply put, Sarah sounds like she cares about what she is  singing, not just trying to make the words fit.  I recommend this CD to  anyone who likes music that will touch your heart.
B00003CWLF|4.0|I don't like the way this movie ends. It changes its point of view. At first we follow Anna's moves. And in the end, it was the Prince's 1st  person monologue. I don't like it. I felt uncomfortable. It's the way of  story telling is unnatural.<br />Chow Yun-Fat's Thai is too slow. Everyone  around him speaks slow Thai. I guess many of the cast are not Thai  actually. A native Thai told me he couldn't comprehend what they were  talking.
B00004U8PA|5.0|The Rocky Horror Picture Show is entirely different from the earlier musical films that have stretched out since the thirties, and the only  comparison I can think of is Ken Russell's Tommy (1975) a rock opera with  music by The Who. Rocky Horror looks and feels like a budget film and the  only piece of music that stands out is the Time Warp, the  reason being, is  that it has more melody than the other numbers. Tommy on the other hand is  full of quality songs sung not only by The Who, but also Elton John and  Tina Turner. But this is the reason why Rocky Horror has become a cult film  because of its lack of sophistication and the attitude towards the older  horror films and Hollywood musicals.<br />         Despite making fun of Flash  Gordon, King Kong or the earlier Hammer classics we know this is just leg  pulling and not a definite statement that science fiction films are  rubbish. In this film it is obvious that Jim Sharman and Richard O'Brian   really love the Frankensteins and the Esther William's swimming ballets  because although they can see how corny these characters and stars appear   in 1975, the campy acting of the present cast brings out the absurdities of  the older heroes but doesn't belittle them.          A sophisticated  audience can sense this and the public themselves probably made fun of the  plots and overacting of these fantasy films. Maybe over a few pints in the  pub the picturegoer did an impersonation of Boris Karlof or Christopher Lee  and when they heard that Rocky Horror was doing the same thing the grouped  audience maybe felt some camaraderie and it wasn't long before the word  spread and the local flea pit (cinema) became the place to go on Saturday  evenings after the last call \\"Time gentlemen please,\\" was shouted out by  the publican at 11 P.M..<br />    The person who becomes a Rocky Horror addict   is the type of individual that also can watch Casablanca countless times,  and fill in all the appropriate punch lines. These people need a sense of  belonging and instead of tearing up the London Underground trains after a  football match on Saturdays then they instead, let go of their inhibitions  by dancing and singing in a Rocky Horror cinema.  Personally I need a few  years break before visiting a film again. Having seen the live version and  comparing it with the film, there is not much difference. Fortunately to  appear in Rocky Horror does not take a genius because any mistakes can be  quietly covered up just by the amateur campy acting.<br />    The makeup  artist that turned Tim Curry into a really good looking woman is who I  would call the main star in this film. Tim's lips have a dark outline  around the red lipstick area that I don't believe  was in vogue in the  middle seventies, so Doctor Frank-N-Furter was away ahead of his/her time.  Tim Curry looks a lot like Ruby Wax an American interviewer that has her  own show on the BBC, only he looks much better. This transvestite character  doesn't have much of a chest, in fact quite flat and that's not the only  place he is flat, ouch!<br />   Although this is a ridicule of Hollywood  musicals and horror films, it does have its part in musical film history  because it does include nearly every cliched scene for example the swimming  pool shots, the unbalanced choreography routines, and the Fay Wray Empire  State Building finale'. Unfortunately one has to be experienced, to put it  tactfully, to recognize these classical scenes.
B000001FFJ|3.0|To be honest, I like 2 songs on this CD, Downtown Train- greatly saved by  G.E. Smith's guitarwork- and Hang Down Your Head.  Tom Waits's music is a  bit too strange to work on any sort of pop level and for that he became a  cult hero.  His lyrics are certainly an avant-garde poetic interpretation  of urban streets and are worth a second and third look.  How he puts it to  music is certainly tough to handle at times and even how he sings can be  really rough.  Still, Waits is a treasure, a special songwriter.  He can  weave through his rough vocals a certain storytelling quality that is  undeniably strong and charismatic.  Downtown Train is electrified through  Waits vocals and Smith's guitars.  It is hands down better than Rod  Stewart's version.  This album may lack a certain rock-pop quality, but  what it does contain is a genuine character telling some great stories.   Tom Waits is amazing, I can tell that just by this album.
6305014140|4.0|The story of Ninja Scroll is not the main interest point here.  Neither is character development.  The main crowd pleasers will be the gory action,  the excellent animation and the cool bad guys.<br />The movie is gory and it  is not cheap in it's blood letting.  Limbs are ripped off, bodies are cut  in half and faces are pounded.  However, this is the appeal of anime.  They  can realistically (for a cartoon) show the fantastic that live movies  cannot.<br />The animation is far above par here.  The forests, characters,  shadows are all drawn with a slickness that is found in great anime such as  Ghost in the Shell.  It is amazing to see how much anime has improved over  time.  Watch this, then watch Black Magic M-66 (1988).  You'll notice how  much better this 1993 film is.<br />The characters are all video game nature,  and that also will appeal to most anime fans.  From the 7 demons (which  include a rock creature, snake charmer, bee-keeper among others) of Shimon  to the wizard like government spy (who looks like the video character  Nico-tine from Samurai Fighter), they are all individualistic with their  talents and look.  It's just too bad, that most of them have no real  personality.<br />The movie avoids the anime pitfalls, which include cute  furry characters, a confusing (trying to be deep) monologue about the  nature of things and a woman who is so eager to be loved by a man  that  she'll do anything.  <br />Good Fun and a memorable viewing  experience....Rating B+
0553278223|4.0|That is the single word that accurately describes this &quot;novel&quot;.  Of course, there's a plethora more, but need I say more? I would have to  say this is one of my top 10 fav books of all times. There aren't any main  characters, main plots, and only minute description. By now you're probably  thinking: What the hell? Well, it would have been a mistake had I not read  this book, for it was referred to me by a dear friend. There are so many  numerous plot twists in this book the sheer size of it boggles ones minds,  and tests ones imaginations. I can clearly hear the distinct sound of  KoRn's 'Dead Bodies Everywhere&quot; echoing through my mind as there is  the scene of the shootout with the renegade spaceman. This book is endowed  with a mass of surreal scenes, that takes one to his/her limits. Read this  book ASAP.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I really liked this cd, if you like rap, you will enjoy this cd, however  it does have rather strong content, so if you don't like foul language  don't get this cd.
0425170349|4.0|This book was very good, but in this review I'm going to post negative  aspects of the read. 1. The book is strongly biased in favor of the  militant right. 2. Supports the myth that Americans are of course, the very  best. 3. Supports the myth that terrorists are nearly harmless. 4. Openly  bashes the vegetarian and environmentalist lifestyle. 5. Openly bashes and  secular movement in the USA today. I hope that should prepare you for an  other wise great read.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I first saw them in concert in 1982.  I must say that I have everything  that they have ever put out.  I have also met them and seen them in concert  a couple of dozen times.  THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST Maiden album ever.  What  else can you say?  There is not a weak song on the disc.  I love them all.   My standouts are Nomad, Blood Brothers, Mercenary and Dream in Black and  White.  If you love metal; even if you've never loved Maiden; you must get  this CD.  Three lead guitars, amazing. UP THE IRONS FOREVER!!!!!!!!
B000001ESF|3.0|As a fan of other (competing) prog rock bands of the 70's such as Yes,  ELP, King Crimson and Jethro Tull, I must state that Rush is different from  all of them.  They add a metal element that most prog rockers (except Tull  and Yes at times) shied away from, and that is what makes 2112 stand out  from the rest of 70's progressive rock.  However, though the album  (especially the title track) is an enjoyable listen it often lacks  something that some of their competitors had, especially those with  classical influence.  Rush has a problem with continuity in their epic, an  impressive 20 minute piece of sci-fi prentension.  the song is a great  song, but it seems to me more like 7 different short songs than a single  epic.  Transitions are often sloppy, and while I know this doesn't bother  many people it bothers me slightly.  However, the musical ability is not  lacking, even without keyboards (a normal staple of progressive rock), and  though it takes a few listens to get accustomed to Geddy's initially  annoying voice after a while one comes to appreciate his tremendous range.   The other songs on this album are mostly filler, the only other songs  besides 2112 that are really worth listening to are &quot;Something for  Nothing&quot; and &quot;Tears.&quot;  A good album of metal prog rock that  holds its own, but if you're looking for a more overall fulfilling (and  equally pretentious) experience I would personally recommend my all-time  favorite, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; by Yes, one of the masterpieces of  progressive rock.  You will not be disappointed with 2112, however, since  the title track pays for the price of the CD.
0792140923|5.0|This movie is probally in the top ten of my favorite all time. Hanks gives  a breathtaking performance as Forrest Gump, as does Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan.  The soundtrack to this film is great old fashioned rock n roll(which I  like). The movie is very sad in many scenes, but there are also many scenes  of joy and humor. Why am I explaining this? Who has not seen this movie  before? Bottom line is that if you want to see a movie about a simple man  accomplishing every thing imaginable, this is what this film is. My  favorite part is when President Nixon asked Forrest to stay at the Water  Gate hotel, and you can guess who is responsible for discovering the  scandle in the hotel. A definite movie to buy, but if you have not seen  this, you better see it as soon as possible. I mean now!
630588255X|5.0|Being a member of the unofficial Harold &amp; Maude cult classic fan club,  I was so excited when I read that the film was released on DVD.  I've had  the laser disc for years and was disappointed from day 1 because the  quality of the recording was terrible.  The full film credits were not even  included, and apparently must have been lost since they don't appear on the  DVD either.  But that is not an issue on the DVD, since the video quality  is noticeably better and with the crystal clear 5.1 audio track, it's like  listening to a new Cat Stevens CD.<br />The story is timeless, the acting  magnificent, and the uplifting effect it gives me every couple of years  when I revisit it never faulters.  Truly one of the best movies of our  time.
0671034065|4.0|This book is great and wonderful.  It is simple reading and once I picked  it up I could not put it down.  Starting reading it at 9pm and finished at  3am.  Wonderful and suggest reading it.
B0000009RT|5.0|A combination of do-woop, psychedelia, entertainment music, jazz, social  critcism, etc., this is a true avant-garde masterpiece! Songs like Go Cry  On..., Motherly Love, anyway The Wind Blows, etc. show the sheer commercial  capability that the band could have used if they wanted to sell big time.  But they clearly didn't. Instead, they were the most innovative band of  their time, setting ground to such classics as &quot;We're Only In It For  The Money&quot; or Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. A true masterpiece,  and historically very valuable release.
078322737X|5.0|I wasn't fortunate enough to be around when cruising was at its prime, but  after this movie, I wish I could have been. The cars and the atmosphere are  something to behold. DVD does the movie justice with high quality sound and  clear film. The bonus materials are also a pleasure with a surprisingly  long making of the film. No matter how old you are, I think there is  something for everybody in this film.
6303421563|5.0|While most of the action directors settle for some german-speaking  muscleanimals and godawful acting, it is sheer pleasure to witness the  releasing of such a true masterpiece as this. While most of the actionstars  aren't really actors at all, it is a pure joy to watch such a prodigies as  Jean Reno, gary Oldman or Natalie Portman bringing true soul to the  characters. Luc Besson has managed to create actionstars with humanity and  true characteristics, something which is adying form of art these days. And  not only do the characters impress me, but also the artistic quality is  very professional, making the action-scenes enjoyable. A definite milestone  in the history of action movies.
B000002KH3|5.0|This album is so in your face, so hard, and so angry. Van Halen brought  rock'n'roll back to the youth. Eddie revolutionized the meaning of guitar  god with Eruption, and Roths primal Ugghh scream in You Really Got Me still  sends shivers up the spine. There is not a weak track on the album. These  boys were hungry for fame. They rocked like no one else had ever seen. One  of the greatest reord debuts ever. From I'm the One to Little Dreamer and  Ice Cream Man, Van Halen hasn't lost its edge in 20 + years.
B000000WA4|4.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness has, surprisingly, earned my seal  of approval. This was a CD that my brother bought. My brother is into  alternative music, which I detest. But listening to some of the songs on  this album, I couldn't help it but tell myself, &quot;Hey, this stuff is  good!&quot;<br />The songs are very poetic, some of them containing remarkable  imagery. They need not have music to make them good, they're well-read as  poems.<br />The artwork on the album is also pretty cool. John Craig, the  illustrator, did a great job in conveying many of the songs' imagery into  art.
0783242808|4.0|I enjoyed the movie for what it is...a new version of the traditional teen movie concept.  The neat part about it is that it's an updated measurement  of what teens go through in this day and age... with the funny  computer/webcam scene...and newer clothing and music.  It's about teens  wanting to get sex...a concept done over and over...and this probably is  one of the more visually-appealing ones made.
B00004LN16|5.0|I'm not agreeing with those who think this is the greatest AC/DC album  ever (That title would have to go to High Voltage, or Highway).  But this  certainly is a decent return to their heyday (and a decent AC/DC album is  worth 5 stars).  And as for that reviewer who says the 40 year olds should  save their money, this 15 year old bought it and thinks it's great.  Long  live the gods of Rock.
6305750750|5.0|This movie did what it set out to do... entertain the fans.  Surely the  producers could never have lived up to our ideals of what the new  generation of STAR WARS movies should be like; our ideals have been 20  years in the making.  George Lucas is an entertainer; and this movie was  down-right entertaining.  The effects were just aweseome; and the story  moved fast and furious, most of the time.  Do we really need to take a  whole movie to establish characterists of the people, when we already have  known them for 20 years?  This is a time of trouble in the galaxy, as soon  as the opening credits roll, and the characters are on a mission to avert  takeover by the Trade Federation.  Over 2 hours of bouncing around the  Galaxy ensued, and during that time we were entertained by the God of STAR  WARS.  There are at least 2 more movies to be made, and I expect to be  treated to over 4 more hours of great entertainment...this movie opens the  groove for the new trilogy...the original STAR WARS movie (now called  Episode 4) was ridiculed for having a dumb story...and now it's beloved.  Probably things will happen that way for this movie too, in time.  Until  then, just enjoy the visual feast and be happen that STAR WARS: THE NEW  (OLD) GENERATION is underway!
B000002L68|5.0|Prince took the style that he had created on 1999 and polished it to perfection making Purple Rain the masterpiece that it is. This album is a  display of all of Prince's talents from his vocal pyrotechnics to his  musical versitility. Prince is at his peak here in creating melodies that  complement his outlandish lyrics perfectly. &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;  begins like a sermon with Prince doing a little preaching behind a raging  organ only to kick into a full blown rocker that never lets up. &quot;The  Beautiful One&quot; is about a man confused and broken hearted because his  lover is with someone else and he can feel the ominous end. This song is  set to a slow pulsating groove culminating in a plea of passion. &quot;DO  YOU WANT HIM OR DO YOU WANT ME.&quot; &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; is a little  tale about a woman in heat who can't get enough set to a seductive beat and  melody. It's a wild and sexy ride that lingers in the mind long after its  over. Some other highlights include &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, which was  Prince's first number 1 hit,&quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;,the furious funked  out &quot;Baby I'm A Star&quot;,and the title song which features guitar  playing that is passionate and inspired. Anyone who tells you that the 80's  was a worthless decade for music should pick up a copy of Purple Rain and  become enlightened. This is timeless stuff.Get it. To quote the Purple  one... &quot;We're not going to let the elevator break us down oh no lets  go!&quot;
B00003CXFG|5.0|A must for every true sci-fi lover. Very different form the usual Hollywood stuff. Expect lots of excitement.
B00000DFMN|5.0|I have searched for this particular CD for years.  I first heard this CD 7 years ago.  I was in awe of &quot;Moments in Love&quot;.  This song had  moved me to feel, imagine, and dream like no other.  This lengthy, melodic,  relaxing classic is a magnificent piece of music.  I am very thankful for  Amazon.com!  I still can't believe I found it!  This song first hit the  airwaves in clubs and quickly became the fave slow jam of every evening.   When it became available to us clubkids on tape, it was sensual and  hallocingenic.  I was saddened when I lost the tape!  I am so overjoyed to  have found it!  Thank You!
0553573411|4.0|With the second volume of the Farseer trilogy, Robin Hobb has certainly written a compelling saga strong on characterization.  The first volume saw  young Fitz growing as a boy and learning the ways around the court of  Buckkeep, the capital of the Six Duchies.  It seems to me that once Fitz  was able to grow into his teens, the author finally has more freedom in  making him the center of the happenings.  Whereas Fitz was mostly a  spectator in Assassin's Apprentice, he now tries to direct the action in  the court; whether he is cleverly manipulated by others or truly acts on  his own is an interesting question.  This novel is less a novel of action  or of epic proportions.  It is obvious that Robin Hobb has no interest in  becoming another Tolkien or Jordan.  This is a novel of court intrigue,  machinations, moves and countermoves.  And Fitz finds himself with far more  to deal with than he can chew.  The characters are even livelier and  interesting than in the first novel.  I found it remarkable how Fitz seems  to grow from page to page as he becomes more observant and active with the  daily activities around him.  From a boy, he becomes a man, with the  unfortunate resulting consequences.  The only drawback I found is that the  underlying moral seems to be that the more resposibilities you shoulder  upon yourself, regardless of your intentions, the more ruthless your  enemies will act toward you.  And, goodness, are they ruthless.  Perhaps i  was hoping for a traditional hero, and Fitz tries his best to be one, but  Hobb yanks him back again and again.
0140177396|2.0|The story is about two gays that are looking for any job. All that time while they are looking for a place also to stay, they pass trough lots of  bad and good things.    They always help and got each other,&quot;I got  you, you got me&quot;said George, one of the principal characters, and this  shows de people who read this book, that when you have a friend that is  passing a bad moment, you have to support him , and that is a good example  for children. Also, the main theme of the story is loneliness, this also  help people to trie to get lots of friends, for not being alon ein the  future.    Story statement by Jhon Steinbeck, is a very interesting book  for all ages, who wants two know about two gays that pass unforgetable  moments and that one of the two lives will end in the ranch, where they  finally lived and work.
6305910103|3.0|A wonderful movie, acceptable transfer, but overall a mediocre DVD.   Paramount, yet once again, provides a premium DVD without the extras we've  become accustomed to--deleted scenes, director commentary, behind the  scenes, etc.  All the more surprising in this case, since it's well known  that ABC ran an extended-length version of this movie, featuring Scotty's  nephew, in the 1980s.  Paramount should get a clue from the X-Files  releases (including the movie), rather than simply milk a loyal fan base.
0140177396|3.0|In our opinion Of Mice and Men is a book that represents the life of itinerant workers.  As we read the book, we started realising how hard life  can be when youre living and working on a ranch.  We also realised how  important it is to have dreams and someone to share them with.        'Guys  like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world '  this  frase, is what we think what the whole book is based on.  There are several  characters in the book that feel recognised by this frase.  Such as Candy  and Crooks.  Candy was an old man that had only one hand.  Ever since his  dog was killed he started feelling empty and lonely. After coming to an  agreement with George and Leannie, he became part of their dream.       Violence was a key point of this story.  There were many scenes of violence  and agression.  for example:  the last one when George finds Leannie in the  bushes and then kills him because Carson and Curly were eventually going to  kill Leannie since he had previously killed Curleys wife.      In our  opinion this book was very well written.  You couldn't put it down for one  second.  We hope that we will read another book by John Steinbeck.
0553478117|5.0|Having heard all of the BBC Radio adaptations of Christie's work I can say  without reservation that this was among the very best.  Of course, much is  owed to the fact that Death on the Nile ranks among Christie's finest  stories, both with respect to plot, dialogue, and character development;  however, what makes this radio play extraordinary are the superb direction  and acting.  This play is so delicious you simply won't want it to end.   Don't miss this one.
0140177396|2.0|In this classic novel, John Steibeck tells the story of two friends in  1930s California. George and Lennie are Itinerant farm workers.They work  for making their dream come true, having a farm of their own with animals,  etc.The story develops in a farm, where we know many characters, all of  them, have dreams.The main theme on the story is dream, But also violence  and loneliness are important. All of the characters, are, in extreme  situations, where the only salvation is work, and dream. I did not like so  much the book,I find it a bit dense, but the story, theme, and how the  story is tell, makes the book, a good book, only suitable for Steinbeck's  fans.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I don't understand music these days. Is it thoroughly IMPOSSIBLE for an artist to come up with *original* and *new* material? Britney Spears has  got to be the most artificial singer around, and I'm not just talking about  her &quot;assets&quot;. Britney as an &quot;artist&quot; is a manufactured  Barbie-like rip-off. Anyone who's old enough to have lived through periods  where *real* music existed (until approximately 1993) will agree that  Britney is an almost carbon-copy imitation of Debbie Gibson. But I suppose  it doesn't matter anyway. Most Britney fans are probably too young to  remember her.<br />As for the songs on this album, they all sound familiar and  overly-produced. like amazon.com's review stated, the chorus in &quot;Oops  I Did It Again&quot; sounds like a complete Streisand/Barry Gibb rip-off.  Any one of the ballads on the album could be mistaken for those of the  likes of, well, anyone. Originality? Where?  And Britney's remake of  &quot;Can't Get No Satisfaction&quot; will literally make you cover your  ears and frantically reach for the &quot;skip&quot; button on the stereo.  Mick, I'd sue.<br />Britney may have a talent for mutilating classics to their  pulp, but the talent of singing is still one she has NOT mastered. The  irritating combo of a raspy voice, &quot;baby&quot;s and &quot;uh uh&quot;  sounds are enough to give you a splitting headache..and I speak from  experience. Someone get this girl some lessons..QUICK. <br />Nowadays lots of  critics keep saying music is dead. Well, they're right. Britney has killed  it.
1559408855|3.0|Yes, it may be disturing and it may be shocking and it may be disgusting  and we may not like to think about these sorts of things, but they do  happen and pieces like Salo serve to remind us of the horrible people that  we are capable of being.
6304618344|5.0|I love this movie. It has good actors, with a good script,good special  effects, and best of all John Woo. John Woo is one of the best  directors...in fact the best. He revolutionized the action movie genre with  slow motion and diving with guns akimbo. Without him the greatest movie  ever(The Matrix), would probably not have been the way it was.
B00003CXGG|2.0|Romeo Must Die was a let down. While entertaining to a degree, the movie  suffered from the typical ridiculous plot (most of which had nothing to do  with 'Romeo &amp; Juliet'). Like most Hong Kong movies, the fights had alot  of wires stunts. But with all the hype and money put into this movie, I was  expecting better quality, not bad acting from Aaliyah, over the top  computer graphic fight scenes and a terrible ghetto rap soundtrack. Skip  this one.
6303430570|5.0|I love this movie! It is very original and very funny. It is really witty  too. Kevin Smith is a really great moviemaker and this is his best  movie...his other FUNNY movies include Dogma and Mallrats.
B000000OU6|4.0|Picture the scene. You're bombing down a narrow country lane, late, and  you know that the forces of nature are going to tap dance on your soul if  you're not through thte front door of the pub in five minutes flat. The pub  is ten minutes away. Greens merge to browns bathed in honey yellow sunshine  flickering like early cinema through nets of leaves vaulting over the road.  You are vaguely aware of the view which occasionally solidifies as you slow  down enough not to plough through the hedge perpendicular to the direction  you're desperately trying to turn in. Your tires scrape to a halt on the  gravel. You get out of the car. You're thirty seconds early. Out of the pit  of your stomach a warm, fuzzy relief. As you reach the entrance to the pub,  collect the first murmurings of the crowd inside which wash over you like  the first waves breaking on a pebbled shore, you're conscious of something  else hardening and defined along the edges of your relief. A vague memory  perfecting into a realisation in sharp relief. The first glimpse of your  one true love is accompanied by the awareness that you have just driven  through one of the most beautiful pieces of countryside you have ever  encountered. As minutes pass and the first taste of real ale slides  deliciously down your throat, you begin to see the trees, the fields. Your  girlfriend asks...&quot;Why are you smiling?&quot;<br />Try not to look at  this album with preconceived ideas about the quality of music informed  simply by what you like. Let the final chords settle and take a walk in the  sunshine. Believe me, your girlfriend too will be asking...&quot;Why are  you smiling?&quot;<br />For the record...it's good.
B000003BDJ|5.0|If you're new to the Rolling Stones, or have limited income and can only  &quot;sample&quot; this remarkable band, then this is the double album to  buy. Disc one is especially strong and showcases the Stones at their  lyrical and creative peak in the 60's. This compilation holds its own  against the famous Beatles red Greatest Hits album, and the Stones early  music is not as dated as the Beatles work in the period 1963-64.<br />Disc one  also priminently features the Stones greatest ballads, not a genre in which  they have traditionally excelled. &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Paint  it Black&quot; remain fresh-sounding and interesting both lyrically and  musically.<br />This will give the novice a good compass from which to gauge  the Stones and you can branch from here. This represents some of the  classic tracks laid down by anyone in the past forty years. No filler songs  on this collection, it's magnificent.
0137549202|4.0|As others have said, this is the DSP bible.  I have worked in the field of  DSP as a post-grad student, lecturer (\\"professor\\") and an R&D  engineer for over 15 years now and this book is in my \\"must-have\\"  collection.  It is the book I learnt my DSP from; it is the book I have  taught DSP from; it is a very good reference book for the  practitioner.<br /><br />Having said that, I should also point out what I believe  this book is not (and why it gets only 4 stars) :  it is not a good book  for self-learning. If this is what you are after, I recommend Rick Lyons'  book \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" (five stars from  me).<br /><br />If you are a mechanical engineer learning DSP, I suggest asking your  local Bruel & Kjaer representative if he'll give you a copy of Bob  Randall's \\"Frequency Analysis\\" published by B&K (ISBN 87  87355 07 8; \\"only\\" 3.5 stars, but 4.5 stars if you're a  mechanical engineer).
6304813759|5.0|That this movie was such a massive hit at the box office shouldn't surprise anyone who has seen it.  Made on a shoestring budget, shot in some  dismal locations, and with the actors and crew probably only being paid the  minimum wage, this movie has the heart, the energy, and the emotion that  highly overbudgeted and overrated Hollywood blockbusters lack.  When the  lead character, Gaz, (played to droll perfection by Robert Carlyle) is  faced with losing rights to his son because his child support is in  arrears, he comes up with an easy way to earn the money and have a bit left  over - by recruiting his best friend, their ex-boss, and 3 others to join  him in a &quot;Chippendales&quot; act, where for one night only, they will  go &quot;The Full Monty.&quot;  (Hence the title).  But as it turns out,  they will not just be ripping their duds off for money - along the way they  will learn about friendship, caring, togetherness, and self respect,  without which no human being can survive.  Alternately side splittingly  funny and deeply touching, this is a film which can be enjoyed by those who  like a dose of humour and sensitivity kneaded into the same dough.
B00004TVV1|5.0|This set is a fan's dream and anyone else who enjoys great music. I'd  write pages for a review, but to sum it all up just make sure sure you hear  this recording!  Should be in your collection!
B000000WJZ|5.0|I bought this album for the hell of it, because it looked really popular.  I don't even like this kind of music.  But, i like this album a lot, very  much like the hit track &quot;disarm&quot;.  If i didn't own it, i'd have  to buy another copy for myself.  This is really weird.  You need a better  stereo to play this album properly - the album is something like 50%  harmony and 50% acid guitar riffs.
630588255X|5.0|From the opening scene where Harold hangs himself, to one of the best  endings I seen, &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; is wonderful.  The story is  about a young man who, in an attempt to get his aristocratic mother's  attention, commits phony suicides.  When he's not doing that, he's  attending funerals, and one day he meets an elderly woman named Maude.   Maude is the exact opposite of Harold, joyous, energetic, lover of life.   The two become friends and form a close bond between each other.   Meanwhile, Harold's mother, who is completely oblivious to who Harold is as  a person, starts to find women for Harold to marry, but he scares them all  away, because the person he really loves is Maude.  If this plot sounds  pretty off beat, it is.  I would recommend this movie for fans of &quot;The  Graduate&quot;, &quot;Rushmore&quot; and &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;.  This a  fantastic film that everyone needs to see.
B00003CXFG|4.0|After paying 8$ to be disapointed by Supernova a few short months before pitch black graced the big screen, I felt that the year 2000 was going to  be filled with empty, super-flashy fx, bad acting and down right diluted  sci-fi. Pitch Black was refreshing and made me look forward to the comming  releases in 2000 with renewed vigor, it was an exciting, fast pased  thriller, that kept you on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next  creature to come out of no where. Though it has many elements that make you  feel like you are watching another Aliens movie, it is still able to make  your skin crawl and make you long for the next sceene. It even had a nice  plot twist to boot. To any sci-fi fan I recommend this film for your  collection.
6303149200|5.0|Before beginning this review, I thought it worth commenting on the previous reviews. <br />As is typical of modern-day liberal-socialist  'pagans', they feel compelled to flirt with the glamour of witchcraft  (itself a 20th century invention) and historical paganism (often  interpreted by christian scholars), whilst distancing themselves from the  darker aspects of the same. For example, &quot;this is possibly the most  accurate portrayal of the Craft ever put to celluloid .  .  . aside, of  course, from the last ten minutes&quot; or &quot;I feel that to some people  this may give rise to ignorant prejudices against 'alternative' religions,  especially Wiccans and other pagan groupings&quot;. And of course the  little darling who saw fit to bleat about the &quot;Witch Burnings&quot;  whilst review a film which had nothing to do with witch-burnings. It should  be obvious to anyone that human sacrifice was and is a part of genuine  heathen practices, from the various Celtic peoples, to the Teutonic  peoples, through to Minoan society, and to Aryan India. Need I mention the  bog people? The practice itself is continued in modern day times: The  Clapham Woods 'Friends of Hekate' phenomenon in the late 1970s, and the  Shropshire Order of Nine Angles in the mid-1990s. Of course, modern pagans  would distance themselves from such practices because it destroys their  good-guy image . . . thus, they are little more than New Agers - The  'Melting Pot' pagans - thus failing to understand that heathenism was - and  is - a complete Weltanschauung, and instead inthralled with  abstractions.<br />I have gone into this at rather torturous length because it  is necessary to appreciate this film at its deepest level. I feel that  &quot;Wicker Man&quot; is, in a small way, one such aspect of the 'Second  Coming of Wotan'  predicted by Carl Jung in his brilliant essay  &quot;Wotan&quot;. This implies a deeper understanding of our Origin and  Future, and the re-integration of the Folk'scollective Shadow-Self. Jung  wrote this essay in response to the rise of National-Socialism, expounding  this in often religious terms. He saw the Hitler Youth solstice rituals and  the Volkisch Movements as being evidence for a nation possessed -  poetically - by Wotan, the great Norse God. I would recommend that every  one have a read of this essay. <br />I have yet to see such a startling and  vivid portrayal of Heathenism in any medium. Everything, from the  landscapes to the music, was sublime, interwoven with an immanent surreal  and threatening atmosphere. The final scene was one of the most disturbing  film sequences I have ever seen, and has haunted me ever since. <br />Much has  been said of the Jungian aspects of the film (the all consuming force of  the policeman's anim - Willow - and its potential to save him from his  eventual sacrifice) and the raw, eroticism of the film (Willow dancing  naked around the adjoining room singing, &quot;say 'How Do'/To the things  I'll say to you/ A stroke as gentle as a feather./Hey Ho..I am here./ Am I  not young and fair?/ Please come, say 'How Do'/ To the things I'll show to  you.) The recurring motifs of cycles (The Maypole Song) and regenerative  powers (the classroom scenes where the children discuss the phallic nature  of the maypole) are worth noting, as is the symbol of Man's empathy with  Nature in the Green Man (c.f. The Green Man/Knight in the legends of King  Arthur, and some of the poems of Seamus Heaney, as well as the old  &quot;Blood and Soil&quot; slogan) in opposition to modern-day  abstractions. <br />However, the part of the film where I thought it lost its  way was with the garbled mythology of Ouarda, The Fool, the six swords, and  the various offerings prior to the sacrifice. Also, the dubbing of Britt  Ekland's performance is jarring at first, but Edward Woodward's powerful  performance more than makes up for this.  <br />All in all, this is definitely  a film worth watching. It may involve some effort to track it down, but you  won't regret it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is/was/will probably always be my favorite Disney movie. It's more raw, more emotional, more realistic, and more jarring. Unfortunately, it's also the last of the &quot;great&quot; Disney movies,  followed by such tripe as &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; and  &quot;Hercules.&quot; It's Shakespeare with a beastly twist.<br />Simba is the  heir to the lion's throne-ahead of his scraggly uncle Scar. The boisterous  young cub bounces around the savanna with his best friend (and fiancee)  Nala, as well as spluttery rhinobird Zazu and his majestic, kindly father  Mufasa. Mufasa is no distant &quot;king of the forest,&quot; like Bambi's  dad-he has an active and excellent role in his son's life. Good role model  there.<br />But when a freak stampede kills Mufasa, Scar tells the traumatized  Simba that it's his fault. The cub runs away from home, hounded by hyenas  into a waterless wasteland. There he is found by a meerkat and a warthog  named Timon and Pumbaa, both outcasts. The duo becomes a trio, and years  pass by... until the hunger-crazed Nala appears, telling Simba what has  happened while he was gone.<br />A warning: Timon and Pumbaa's cutie gross-out  antics get old quick. Just tune them out, except for the &quot;luau  dance.&quot;<br />Aside from the gorgeous musical score, the animation is  truly spectacular, combined with excellent voices. The scene where Mufasa  speaks to Simba to urge him back ends with a heartfelt, &quot;Father, don't  leave me...&quot; that moves me to tears. Excellent and dramatic is the  &quot;Circle of Life&quot; song at the beginning, the battle with Scar, and  the glorious shot of Simba climbing Pride Rock, roaring, and being saluted  by his subjects.<br />This movie will make you cry, laugh, and show you  strength in the making. Don't miss it.
B000002GF8|5.0|Although The Police were like the anti-power trio of pop music, this album  is a stunning tour-de-force; its not only one of the most brilliant albums  of the 80s, but definitely in the top ten of all rock music.   The  instrumentation is stark and exotic, sometimes eerie.  And the production  values are outstanding; Hugh Padham proves he was up to scratch with both  this and Genesis' eponymous 1984 album.  the A&amp;M Audio Masters Plus  edition is, to me, one of the best-sounding CDs that I own.  Its a  gorgeous, brooding, perfect-sounding masterpiece.<br />The music, to the five  or six people on the planet who haven't already heard it, forms the basis  of the most consistently engaging album of the Police's too-brief career.   The hits are all there, but its the deeper cuts that demand your attention.   The unjustly misaligned &quot;Mother&quot; (admittedly a frightening song)  is a brilliant rubric against the underlying musical simplicity, it takes a  few appreciative listens to realize that in fact Summers is playing a  cleverly-disguised basic blues chord progression!  The eerie percussion of  &quot;Walking In Your Footsteps&quot; might be Copeland's finest moment,  creating a prehistoric musical collage with Summers' sparse distant guitar  swatches.  And I  could write a whole book on &quot;Synchronicity II&quot;,  the most epic song around 5 minutes ever written.  I love everything that  Andy Summers does on this song, from the menacing feedback solo, to the  rapid fire picking that fades in at the end of the song.  <br />Sting has  written even more beautiful lyrics on some of his solo works (like  _The_Soul_Cages_) but he's still on top of his form here.  The dark lyrical  images in &quot;King Of Pain&quot;, and the contrasting verses in  &quot;Synchronicity II&quot; capturing perfectly the hell that is the  modern industrial workspace, with the frightening allusions to the Loch  Ness Monster shadowing a dark Scottish cottage, are the finest moments.   The smash hit &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is a study of contrast, the  gentle soft-rock arpegiated chords belies the dark nature of Sting's  lyrics; its essentially the anthem of a stalker.  The album is so  cosnsitently brilliant on so many levels you can even overlook Sting's  intellectual pretentions on songs like &quot;Synchronicity I&quot; -  &quot;If we share this nightmare, Then we can dream   Spiritus Mundi&quot;  or &quot;Walking In Your Footsteps&quot; - &quot;You consider me the young  apprentice, caught between the Scylla and Charbydis.&quot;  Or you may  think its also pure genius, I don't know.  <br />A lot of music critics were  polarized by this album, I think the controversy was hogwash.  The fact is  that it not only holds up to the music being created at the time, but it  transcends the pop niche and explodes into the popular consciousness of  rock music.  Truely deserving of the word &quot;classic.&quot;
6305508550|5.0|My boyfriend and I picked it up as a rental, and didn't know much about it  except that Jennifer Aniston and that &quot;Swingers&quot; guys was in it!   But it was HILARIOUS!  Anyone and everyone can relate to the story.  We  have since made our friends watch it and everyone is rollin'!!
B00003CXFG|5.0|For a horror movie, the director does an excellent job of setting the scene for character conflict, action and overall plot development. Don't  get me wrong, it isn't a masterpiece, but when you add the visual content,  this movie becomes a clut flick... And even if you don't agree with my  critique of the plot, just the imagery and flow of the movie alone make it  a must see. Best seen in Dolby Digital surround with a large screen. If you  watch it on your 15&quot; kitchen television with no additional speakers,  you'll ruin the movie completely.
B000005J56|5.0|Disappointed that it's not salsa? That's like being disappointed that  Mozart isn't disco. Don't you get enough salsa dance music from the myriad  commercial performers being foisted by the record companies? No, this is  art. Performed by artists. If you have no art in your soul, better stay  with your commercial music.<br />If you do like art, and if you're open to new  experiences, this is a deeply moving and rare collection. This music was  denied we Americanos Norte like forbidden fruit for so many years.<br />The  only criticism I have is Ry Cooder. Why couldn't he be happy in his role as  producer. Why did he have to play on the album? Most of the parts he plays  sound completely out of place. What is a country-boy slide guitar doing in  Cuban son music? Fortunately, the performances of the other musicians are  so strong as to make this a minor fault.
B000004747|5.0|I have over 40 discs by Rahsaan and it's hard to give any less than 5  stars. This really has a number of good tunes and just romps and rolls.  Probably one of his more tongue-in-cheek records next to 3 sided dream.  Feel free to email me about Rahsaan.
B00003CWPQ|3.0|Eyes Wide Shut is a very frustrating film.  As Stanely Kubrick's last movie it shows what the director was capable of but is rather lacking at  the same time.  <br />Despite what many have said about the film, it isn't a  porno movie. Sorry.  It is a series of adventures into a intresting dream  world.  Every scene is very well shot and unique.  In fact it's fair to say  that the whole isn't the sum of it's parts.  While all the different  encounters Tom Cruis's character has are well-done and intresting, they  don't fell connected and the story falls apart quickly.  Also, the audience  never really gets a sense of Cruis's or Kidman's character.  <br />The film  also feels rather incomplete.  Many times it apears the story is heading  toward an interesting confrontation only to have the plot abandon the  situation and head in a completely different direction.  I still recommend  seeing Eyes Wide Shut but the film could have been so much more.
0316777722|5.0|What a fantastic book! I couldn't put this one down.  I highly recommend  it!  The essay about the family pet was VERY AMUSING and reminded me of my  own family.
B00003CX59|5.0|A classic children's tale masterfully turned into an edge of your seat thriller - Tim Burton has done it again! I loved every moment of this  movie, from the queer and melancholy town of Sleepy Hollow, to the  background music that seems to just jump at you at all the right moments,  to the never-lifting fog that blankets the woods where the horseman  (Christopher Walken) rides. Though those of you with a weak stomach may  want to fast forward some parts because Burton doesn't leave anything out,  please note that!     And the cast? Well, I won't ruin the movie for you  but will tell you that Depp and Ricci light up the screen. Johnny Depp  plays an irresistible, though dismal, and convincing detective named  Ichabod Crane who travels from New York City to Sleepy Hollow to use \\"his  methods\\" to solve some grisly be-headings. Christina Ricci  - who seems to  be a perfect person for these sorts of movies - plays Katrina Van Tassel, a  quiet character and seems to take more notice in Crane than others. There  are other cute little cast members, and oddly frightening ones, but to sum  it up, I could not think of a better cast for Sleepy Hollow.      Aside  from the fact that Burton twists Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy  Hollow (though in the end I'm very glad he did) and nobody can resist  fainting in this movie, if you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, this  is a must rent movie! You should be very pleased!
B000002P74|5.0|This is the album that catches everybody's attention, with songs like the  popular Sweet Home Alabama, Call Me the Breeze, Workin For MCA, Ballad of  Curtis Loew,the hard rocking Needle and the Spoon, Don't Ask Me No  Questions, and for a great bonus song Was I right or Wrong. This album does  have the best guitar work overall. I highly suggest this album, no wait if  you don't have this album then you don't deserve to listen to music.

B000002P48|5.0|This has to be the best definded rock album there is to talk about. It has  something from everything from folk like Things Going On to slow rock  ballads like the famous Tuesday's Gone and Simple Man( my personal favorite  ) to the great hard rock of I Ain't the One, Gimmie 3 Steps, and the ever  so famous FREEBIRD. You can't go wrong with this album at all!! Trust Me,  I'm a SkynyrdFREAK!
B000002J09|5.0|This is a wonderful album, though it is not my favorite by Zeppelin (try buying their third LP, it really shows off their diversity with great folk  tunes like Gallows Pole and Bron-Y-Aur Stomp). I'm writing this review to  cancel the review of a prejudiced and unfair Thomas Gragdy P.H.D.  I would  think with his education he would critique this album based on, well, the  album.  Instead he has concocted in his mind a Led Zeppelin fan base of  unemployed, unkempt, ignorant high school dropouts.  Okay, Doctor, let's  get out the crowbar and open our minds a few centimeters.  I am a  17-year-old devout Led Zeppelin fan.  According to your logic I should have  3 neglected toddlers (the fourth little 'un is on the way) and I quit  school after they started talking about multiplication tables.  If I had a  job (which you probably believe I don't) I would barely have enough to  sustain my crack cravings.  Only the misfits of society can like Led  Zeppelin.  Well, in reality I'm graduating first in my high school class,  maintain a job that pays much better than McDonald's (this despite the fact  I'm taking six AP courses and one college course as a senior), I took  Calculus in my junior year and received a 5 (the highest score) on the AP  exam, and I speak two foreign languages (after reading your review for Os  Mutantes I figured this, at least, might impress you).  I do not mean to  brag, though I know it comes off that way, I would just like to point out  that there are intelligent people love Led Zeppelin.  You don't, I  understand that, I disagree with your taste in music obviously, but I do  not judge it as trash that only drug addicts can tolerate!  I hope you may  now feel free to insult the album based on the music itself, not an  uninformed opinion of the band's followers.<br />Now that I've said my peace  to the doctor, I would like to praise this album.  It starts out stron with  Black Dog (named after a dog that visited the studio during recording in  case anyone was curious).  This song provides a great opportunity to  appreciate John Paul Jones's bass guitar work.  <br />Rock and Roll is better  live, but the studio version still keeps the album moving.<br />The Battle of  Evermore is my favorite song.  I love J.R.R. Tolkein and this song  incorporates a folk, yet mysterious sound that creates a fantastic  atmosphere for the allusions to LOTR.<br />As for Stairway to Heaven, well,  this song made them legends.  Wonderful song, though they have done much  better in my opinion.  I still love it.<br />Misty Mountain Hop (more LOTR) is  a fun song and it is carefully placed after two slower, more serious songs.   <br />Four Sticks, with its fragmented rock and roll sections is really a  beautiful song with many aspects.<br />Going to California - yet again this  song was placed perfectly.  Misty Mountain and Four Sticks were relatively  fast-paced and involved and this simple ballad brings a relaxing and  soothing facet to to album.<br />When the Levee Breaks is not only a great  rock and roll/blues song, it is the best song to sing on rainy days.  Humor  me.  It really is a good song.<br />All in all, do not buy this album if you  are only interested in Stairway to Heaven.  The BBC version is far superior  to the studio version.  But if you want to listen to a variety of music  styles and enjoy other classic rock bands, then this is a must.  It is a  great introductory album to those starting to listen to Zeppelin.  Do not  buy the greatest hits volumes (Why, Jimmy, why! ).  They leave out  good songs and are not arranged with the care that was put into the  original albums.
0684857219|5.0|this is an excellent book written by the guy everyone associates with the  sport. it has great information on the history of bodybuilding and tips on  competing. but you don't have to be a bodybuilder to enjoy this book. i'm  not. i'm just a guy who goes to the gym to keep in shape and have the  physicality i want. and arnold's book can be a great help, especially if  you are like me and get bored with certain exercises easily. the part of  the book that really makes it all worthwhile is the section(s) that deal  with the different exercises for each body part.
B000005EJL|3.0|First of all, I think most of the lyrics on this CD are too cheap to be true. All cliches are used, and feed my suspicion to guess that the  songwriters lacked inspiration, to say the least. The rhythm is okay, but  the rime is lousy. Moreover, there's a tendency of tawdriness in all  arrangements, the jingling little organ, the harmonica of Toots Thielemans,  the awful synthesizer in the background for lack of decent accompaniment of  strings (which is often almost as bad). The nice thing though, is the  ironic use of musical styles, every dancestep passes by and when you listen  closely you can't help grinning, at least there's some inventiveness here.  The number \\"Some things never change\\" is one of the better on this CD.  It  bears reminiscence to former Supertramp songs, there's change of rhythm,  and there's a nice flutesolo, plus a nice guitarsolo, rather hypnotizing  drums, some of the ingredients former Supertramp work made so irresistible.  The only thing I miss is the use of a real piano. The trumpets at the end  are superb.<br />The overall impression: rather nice popsongs, but a lack of  inspiration causes no real surprises. The HCDC recording is very good,  although a bit loud in parts.
B000005ILF|5.0|In light of the huge success of Brand New Day, let me pontificate on the  delights...well, admirable qualities in light of the somber mood...of  Mercury Falling.<br />One of the reasons I became so addicted to Sting was his  amazing ability to craft insightful, intelligent songs with his lyrics.   For example, everyone and their brother has written a song about lost love,  but what artist has said, &quot;I spend all my days/In the search for dry  wood?&quot;  The winter metaphor in &quot;Hounds of Winter&quot; could be  easily turned into a cliche, but there's just something about the spin of  his words that makes it moving.  &quot;I Hung My Head&quot; plays on its  title, creating different, increasingly more disturbing meanings.   &quot;All Four Seasons&quot; is sort of like Billy Joel's &quot;Always a  Woman&quot; with a liberal dash of humor.<br />I have a friend who can tell  you volumes about the musical genius of the album.  Unfortunately, he's not  around to outline them.  I was an English major, so I'll stick to what I  know.  And I know that Sting's masculine-yet-silky voice wrapped around his  fantastic words makes this one of my favorite albums.
B000001F76|5.0|This is the collection anyone should start their Hank collection with as  it contains 40 of his most popular songs.  There are well researched liner  notes with this set, the music is great and Hank is the &quot;Hillbilly  Shakespeare&quot; and that nickname says alot.  You will hear the reason  why his music is often covered and why his spirit appears in many of  country's biggest hits to this day through this collection.  As I said,  this collection is only an introduction unless you aren't a huge fan.  If  you want more or are a huge fan, than you should invest in either  &quot;Original Singles Collection&quot; or &quot;Complete Hank  Williams&quot; depending on your budget for a definitive overview of his  career and liner notes that are even more thorough than the liner notes in  this set.  The version of &quot;Weary Blues From Waitin'&quot; that appears  on this set is the version with the overdubbed instruments used on the 78  rpm single.  The version on the boxed sets is the undubbed demo recording  so even if you buy the more complete collections you should keep this set,  but for many listeners, this will do just fine for a collection of Hank's  hits.  Also this set is more compact for travel purposes than the boxed  sets are as many travelers don't want to bring that much Hank music on the  road so this set will serve the purpose for Hank fans on the go.
0805017305|3.0|I hate to tell you people this, but if the white man hadn't of come onto  the scene, then the US, the greatest land on earth, never would have  existed.  I certainly don't think breaking treaties is honorable, but the  INDIANS KILLED A LOT OF AMERICAN SETTLERS who came here, in cold blood.  No  one ever talks about that, they always talk about how innocent they are.   Read the Declaration of Independence, in which our forefathers talk about  being attacked by the &quot;savages.&quot;<br />And I hate to tell you this  also, but the so called &quot;Native Americans&quot; emigrated here from  Asia Minor.<br />So people can say whatever they want about the horrid  &quot;white man,&quot; but the horrid white men formed this country, not  the Indians.  <br />After years of being slaughtered by Indians, the horrid  white man decided that he had to fight back.
B00000BKE0|4.0|I realize that I am in the minority when Isay that this is one of my  favorite Maiden albums.I love Janick Gers's guitar playing.His solos on  &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; and &quot;The Assassin&quot;(my 2 favorites on  it)are nothing short of unreal.Yes,Adrian Smith is sorely missed.His  contribution to the maiden sound is undeniable.However their sound,although  different,is no less powerful than it ever was.My only complaint(4 stars  instead of 5) is that Bruce's voice clearly needed a rest.A few months off  before cutting his vocal tracks would have done him a world of good.His  range is not there,and he is obviously struggling to hit the notes that he  does hit.There is not a bad song on this cd.Give it a chance,and keep an  open mind.Yes Adrian is gone,yes the sound is different,and YES they still  sound great.
6304466498|4.0|I've wathced this movie at least 15 times, and each time i still laugh! it  has a lot of replay value because there ar lots of little funny things that  you do not notice when you first watch it. Example? at the end just before  you see our 2 hero's in the bar you see ships parked outside and if you  look closely you'll see the millenium falcon!
0767903854|5.0|I've been to Australia, and honestly wish this book was out before I went.  The tales he has are funny, and true. Simply a wonderful book. As for the  poisionous things. Watch out.
6305537798|4.0|I thought this movie was great, lots of funny and romantic moments. This  is the best Teen movie i ever watched, and believe me i've see tonnes of  them and didn't really like most of them. This is why it took me a while to  decide to rent this Movie. The Soundtrack that comes with this movie is  also really good. They play the right songs in the right moment which makes  the viewer pulled into the story.
1559408855|1.0|Do not listen to the other reviews on this page unless you like to see the sexual torture of innocent children.<br />This film is beyond art. Pasolini only did this movie to get attention for his political beliefs. Andy Warhol has better film work then this.<br />Watch it once, feel very sick and dirty, then take a shower, and be a better person for understanding that you dislike the movie.
B000002HRE|4.0|Okay, I have one message: It's not as bad as everyone tells it...I admit it is disappointing to some point-but not as disappointing as Load, which  is the worst album next to Garage, Inc. Clearly, I think TRUE Metallica  fans have been sold out. They almost make me sick now, because of the stuff  they've shown now...and yes I have been a fan since the day they started.  And their best album is ...And Justice For All-no matter if the sound is  shoddy or not, it has all the songs on it. Master Of Puppets will also go  down in history too. Ride the Lightning and Kill Em All are REALLY good,  also...but I really think Metallica has really sold us TRUE fans  out...peace
B00003CXHJ|3.0|I cannot believe someone would make such an excellent film about a 'fictional' US submarine event when this actually took place during WW2  involving a British submarine. I think the recent Hollywood war films have  been fantastic, but little or nothing is ever mentioned about the British  war effort especially in this film which I think is a slight insult to the  British servicemen who actually captured the Enigma machine from the  Germans. Still an outstanding flick with some convincing special effects.
B000001FDQ|5.0|That was my impression of some of the work on this album by neo-classical  metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. I first heard of Yngwie when I was in  Media Arts class in high school. A student had brought in a video of  various guitarists and when Yngwie came on, no one knew who he was  (including me). The teacher said that this guy Malmsteen is one of the  fastest players in the world. I thought &quot;cool!&quot; then never gave  it much thought for a while. Then one day, I read in a cd club magazine  that he is, again, one of the fastest players around. That made me think of  what my teacher had said, and I decided to order the album &quot;Rising  Force.&quot; Boy was I impressed! &quot;Black Star&quot; starts it off and  sets a tone for the last song &quot;Farewell.&quot; &quot;Black Star&quot;  starts off with a nice soft intro and then goes into some very impressive  and heartfelt melodies, while maintaining a hard edge. &quot;Farewell&quot;  is a nice extension of the intro to &quot;Black Star&quot; and is a nice  way to end such an awesome album. &quot;Far Beyond the Sun&quot; is the  song that really blew me away. It is the perfect example of Yngwie's  speediness and control. I was amazed at how he can unleash these lightspeed  bursts of notes at any time. This is a simply amazing song! &quot;Now Your  Ships Are Burned&quot; also features some great playing, but is  unfortunately marred by typical goofy 80's metal lyrics (this song and  &quot;As Above So Below&quot; are the only songs with vocals, thankfully).  &quot;Evil Eye&quot; is somewhat similar to &quot;Black Star&quot; and is  no less intense. &quot;Icarus' Dream Suite Opus 4&quot; is incredible. It  has strings, acoustic playing, great drumming and is just amazing. It is  hard to describe so you should check it out for yourself. &quot;Little  Savage&quot; takes a while to get going, but gets pretty cool after a  minute or so. Well, Yngwie himself is amazing, but so are his bandmates.  The drumming issuperb, as are the keyboards, which provide an excellent  compliment to the axe hero without going overboard. This is a great album  that deserves more recognition than just in guitar mags. It is absolutely  essential for any guitar fan and neo-classical fan alike.
0679746048|2.0|I've read many books that have a similar style to this one and this was  the worst. I don't even remember half the book, that's how uninteresting I  felt it to be. If you're looking for memoirs of mental patients and things  of that sort, read &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (Sylvia Plath) or &quot;Prozac  Nation&quot; (Elizabeth Wurtzel).
B00000I924|4.0|Jeff Beck has come a long way from the Yardbirds days, that's for sure. I really didn't expect this one, as I thought it would be more blues oriented  (though there are some blues tracks, such as the mutant blues &quot;Blast  From the East&quot;). It is very heavy at times and uses all the modern  tricks of the trade. As a result, this is a very hip album that even  younger listeners will enjoy in this age of alternative. The album features  his signature style, of course, but is very modern in its beats and sound  effects. They could play some of these songs at a dance club and everyone  would love it. It is nice to see an artist advance like this, like Joe  Satriani has done with his latest album &quot;Engines of Creation.&quot;  &quot;Who Else!&quot; is very cool and just begs to be played loud. Good  work, Jeff!
B000002J09|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews submitted to this sight and for the most part  agree with those who feel this album is great.  Is it the greatest of all  time ? No.  Is it one of the best albums of it's time ? Yes.  For those of  you comparing this album to Pink Floyd or The Stones or The Doors or  another super group, there is no comparison because each one identified a  different type of music.  This Led Zeppelin album strikes a hard chord with  me because nobody else at the time of its release was producing the kind of  rock it contains.  NOBODY.  Were there other great rock albums ? yes but  not like this one.  I give it 5 stars for creativity, musicianship, color,  depth and tightness.  I can go into Bonham's polyrhythmic drum parts on  Black Dog or Jimmy's lead on the same song or Robert's vocals on Stairway  to Heaven John Paul's simple but effective keyboards on Misty Mountain but  its all good. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do....
B00004SCX6|4.0|I don't say this album weaker then the first.  This one has more of a pop beat to it and is a better listen, IMO.<br />I'll go through each track, so   you can see the comments<br />1) Oops!...I did it again- I'm sure everyone's  heard this, so I'm not going to go into it.  It's just a nice pop  beat.<br />2) Stronger- Definatly my favorite song on the album.  It got me  hooked the first time I heard it and I love it.<br />3) Don't Go Knockin' On  My Door- This has it's good and bads.  The beat is a little 'different' and  it didn't really appeal to me the first time I heard it.  It grows on you  though.<br />4) Satisfaction- I never really liked the Rolling Stones version  of the song, but there's something about the beat in BS's that makes me  enjoy it.<br />5) Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know- I don't really like this  song, not for a certain reason, it just doesn't have that catchy of a  melody.<br />6) What U See (Is What U Get)- This song reminds me partly of  'Baby One More Time' in its jive.  This is another favorite as this is the  kinds of songs I bought the album to hear.<br />7) Lucky- A nice ballet that  I'm sure you've all heard<br />8) One Kiss From You- The worst track on the  album, I still don't like this song.  The 'Soda Pop' from this album.<br />9)  Where Are You Now- My favorite ballad by BS! It doesn't sound like Pop at  all this song, and it's definatly one of her best.<br />10) Can't make you  love me- Like track 6 in its tempo, a nice beat makes it a good song.<br />11)  When Your Eyes Say It- Not a huge fan of this song, its not bad but it just  doesn't have the same feelings of the other songs.<br />12) Dear Diary- The  2nd worse song, this one just stinks.  Doesn't even sound like her type of  music.<br />Also, there are little talking parts after songs that lead into  the next song.  A big mistake in my opinion...<br />A good listen, but not a  well rounded album
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album is amazing. Fiona Apple is just so talented. Her songs are just  so brilliantly written. She really knows how to sing from the heart. Alot  of people say the best song on the album is Fast As You Can or Limp. I  think the best song is Get Gone. Her voice on the song is just amazing. Buy  this album. Even if you don't like music like this, you will like this  album.
B00003CXFG|5.0|who ever doesn't buy this movie is missing out on some really good acting and THIS movie. it's all fresh and original and i must admit that the story  line seem familiar but what story line hasn't? so just go now and order.  it'll be worth your money. i guaruantee it.
0451167716|5.0|Mario Puzo has forever gained my respect for writing this gorgeous novel and the movie that was the result.  Two of the most beautiful pieces of art  in this world.  One a life of words and the other an epic.  Both  breathtaking.  I saw the movie before reading the book, but I belive they  complimented each other.  In the book you get a little background on some  of the things that you didn't know about it the movie, hey that happens all  the time, but here the movie is almost word for word of what this book is,  almost a direct translation.  I know I am reading a truly good novel when i  feel an emptiness in my heart upon turning the last page.  This is such a  wonderful book.  Please if you haven't read or have at least seen the  movie.  Get the hell outta here and do something about it, yeah you, you're  doing yourself such a diservice by just sitting here.  God supposedly (I am  an atheist) made beauty, so get the freak out there and go experience it.   Buy the book, it will make a worthy addition to your book shelf, trust me,  just take a chance. Capisce?
630528069X|5.0|Die Hard is action film director John McTiernan's ( Predator, Die Hard With a Vengeance, The Hunt For Red October, Last Action Hero) best work and  is certainly one of the best action films ever made. Followed by two lesser  but good and entertaining sequels, Die Hard 2: Die Harder and Die Hard With  a Vengeance. The basic plot of Die Hard is that NYPD cop John McClane (a  great performance by Bruce Willis) comes to L.A. to visit his wife when her  office party on the top floor of a 40 story building is crashed by  terrorists. Willis must play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with the  terrorists to rescue everybody, a plot that has been re-used in several  films with different settings (battleship, train, plane, etc.) including  Under Seige, Under Seige 2: Dark Territory, and Air Force One. <br />Alan  Rickman is really good as head baddie Hans Gruber, a cold, ruthless,  calculating, slick, desperate, and ultimately cruel villain. In my opinion  he and Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) compete to be the best Die Hard villain.  Though there are too many supporting characters, they play their parts  well, including Hart Bochner as  a smooth-talking hostage who tries to  negotiate his way to freedom, William Atherton as a slimy reporter, and  Bonnie Bedilia as McClane's wife, Holly. Others include James Shigeta as  Joseph Takagi, Reginald VelJohnson as Seargent Al Powell, De'voreaux White  as as Argyle, and Robert Davi (Licence To Kill, Maniac Cop 2) as Special  Agent Johnson and Grand L. Bush as Agent Johnson (no relation). <br />The  skyscraper is an excellent setting, and the explosions and gunfights are  nothing short of spectacular. They include a rooftop and helicopter  explosion, an armored car being taken out by a rocket launcher, an elevator  shaft/first several floors bombing, a rooftop gunfight, a top floor  gunfight, and an office gunfight, plus several chases. Oscar nominations  for Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best  Visual Effects by the visual effects maestro Richard Edlund (three Star  Wars films, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghostbusters, Alien 3, Plotergeist I  and II, and 2O1O). No wins for Die Hard.<br />The music is very well done, the  cinematography is great, the screenplay is good and has some funny lines,  and the makeup is especially outstanding and realistic, showing how it  would be if you got shot. Overall, a groundbreaking action film that is a  real treat to watch.
B000001IQH|5.0|Some people just don't get Rancid. Whether it's Tim's slurry vocals or  Lars' uber-harmonies, their sledgehammer early punk or their saccharine  sweet ska lamentations, some people just get lost in the mix. It seems way  too easy to criticize Rancid, no matter what style of music you listen to.  Critics of Rancid miss out on probably the best music ever made. No matter  what the style, Rancid hits you with all of the emotion, love, loss and  pain that you've ever experienced, in one neat CD package. This is by far  the best album they have ever made. Not to say that anything else (past or  future) is great; anything by Rancid is by definition ten times better than  any other band. But on &quot;..And Out Come The Wolves&quot;, everything  just falls into place. Many people say Rancid is trying to be a later-day  Clash; I disagree. While the Clash were amazing, their music dealt with  issues that were distinct to an era that I missed and a country I never  lived in. With Rancid, every song speaks straight to you. And that's  something you just don't get in any other band, punk or otherwise. This is  the best album you will ever own. Period.
B000002A6U|5.0|Janis Joplin's 1971 release &quot;Pearl&quot; is the best album by Janis.   Even though it's not a finished album but it never will be.  She died  before she had time to finish the album. Thats why  &quot;Buried Alive in  The Blues&quot; has no vocal, because she died the night before she was  suppose to record that vocal. The rest of the album is Janis at her best  vocally and musically  &quot;Move Over&quot; a song penned by Janis is the  lead track and probably the best song on the record. All the songs are  great and very emotional. She left this world too soon but we do have her  music. What little there is, but go get pearl it is her best.
0062502182|5.0|This book reminds me somewhat of an artpiece, lots of people look at an artpiece but rare are those that look into it. There is nothing  materialistic, nor political nor sexist about the simple lines that  cunstruct this story. Don't take it in its first degree, there is a quest  in this man's life like in all of ours. We aren't different from him under  this aspect, but in this beautiful story Coehlo shines the beauty of  destiny and casuality in life. We're all going in one direction but the  routes that we take to go there differ. All of us might have experienced  some coincidences that have opened new doors or put us right back on track.  This book is all about it, a man inspired by a quest and guided by fate, in  which he believes. Simple and beautiful.....
0671034065|3.0|As a die hard Linda Howard fan, I could not wait for this book.  It did  not quite live up to expectations.  If this was another author I would have  loved it, but it did not quite make it worth buying the hardback.  I have  already traded it in to the used book store.  I did not feel that we  really ever got to know the characters.  It all happened way too fast and  was entirely to predictable.  You have the murderer picked out in the first  chapter.  You can even guess the order that they are going to die in. It is  a good read, but I would wait for a library copy.  It is not one of her  keepers.  There were some funny scenes, but I think after reading other  reviews that I expected them to be more.
B000002H97|5.0|This album only heard once took me to a diffrent kind of rock and roll this mostly soft rock but in my opinion lightyears better than kill em all  but as good as re-load.The best tracks on the cd are the god that failed  and my friend of misery.if you dont have a metallica album and want to get  one start with this classic CD and if you just like softer rock get this CD  also.This well always be in my greatest hits collection.
6301966562|4.0|I saw this movie on cable about 13 years ago, and I have been wanting to  own it ever since.  Most people haven't even heard of &quot;Electric  Dreams&quot;, which is a shame because it is such a great story! A  &quot;nerdy&quot; architect falls for a beautiful cellist in the same  apartment building.  The romantic element of the movie manages not to  become sappy because of an ironic twist: the architect's computer falls in  love with the cellist as well!  At first, the computer helps the awkward  fellow woo the girl, but quickly decides to sabotage lover boy and win her  for itself!  Getting the audience to believe that the computer is alive is  quite a feat considering the limited special effects...but it works.  I was  alternately rooting for one and then the other, and even cried at the end.   I would LOVE to own this movie, especially since I can't even find it to  rent anymore.  However, until the price comes down...
B00003W8NM|5.0|First rule of Fight Club?Watch it at least three times.Second rule: Do NOT talk about what it's &quot;about&quot;.Third rule:Accept that all your  preconceptionsabout &quot;hip&quot; contemporary &quot;classics&quot;are  tired, conformist and badly in need of a wake-up call or, preferrably, a  smack upside the head if you do not dig this true masterpiece! Other  rules to viewing and appreciating and enjoying Fight Club:There are NO  rules to it!  This movie should bombard you with images, sounds, ideas --  and many of them will probably be UNACCEPTABLE to you.  Which is the point.  Fincher &amp; Co. pull no punches here.  This movie gets in your face and  under your skin.  You might hate it at first.  Work on that reaction. In  every way a one-of-a-kind moviethat, a few years from now, will belauded as  one of those &quot;seminal&quot; works by the solons who ignored itin order  to rhapsodize about hackneyed &quot;boomer&quot; fluff like American  Beauty. (And yes, I am of that hypocritical generation!)Fight Club is the  real McCoy.Accept no substitutes!

0425107469|5.0|With a mix of horror,sci-fi and drama, this book has it all.  Great  characters, great plot, total suspense, funny,sad, an emotional roller  coaster.  Easy to read, impossible to put down. One of my all time favorite  books.  I have re-read it several times and still get the same effect as  the first.  Fantastic!!
B00003CXFG|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie, I didn't even catch it until it appeared at the second run theater at my school.  It actually turned out to  be a great movie.  Vin Diesel(Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room) put in a  great performance, very convincing, as does the rest of the supporting  cast.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat through most of the movie, and I  highly recommend it.
B00004XPP0|1.0|You all know the plot to the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot; so I won't waste my time so I'll just cut right into the review. The Special Edition  cuts (which are being included in this trilogy boxset) are worse than the  original Theatrical Cuts. Lucas, himself said all other copies of the film  will be the Special Edition from now on. I say don't waste your time on  buying this set and try to find the original theatrical cut VHS copies of  this film.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Personally, I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  While it did nothing to scare me, the plot kept me thinking well after the movie  had ended.  It got better every time I saw it.
B000002MG1|5.0|this album is brilliant.  i got it because it had everybody hurts on and i  love that song.  when i first heard it, the first song was tremendous -  drive, problys my favourite  on the album.  then i grew to really like all  the others like try not to breathe, monty got a raw deal, man on the moon ,  and find the river. theyre all really good. this is my 2nd fvourite alum  behind one from the modern by ocean colour scene.  after getting this rem  cd i gotmonster which is good but outa all rem cds this one supposed to be  the best
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is different from Nevermind, if thats the only CD youve heard by  them...the songs are alot more sad and angry.The songs have more singing in  them unlike Nevermind, where it's mostly jamming on the guitar and  drums.But, if youre a true fan, you'll really love this one.<br />FAVORITES:  Heartshaped Box; Very Ape; Milk It; All Apologies
0670880728|3.0|Our book group picked this book to read.  It was a fun summer read.  I  haven't been single for so long, it makes me think, \\"Is this really how it  is or was?\\",  pretty \\"bizarre\\".  I liked the ending.
B000009QPO|3.0|Not bad but a little on the repetitious side. Its like the same song over  and over again. Simple is good, I like simple  music, and the mood of this  cd is consistent, which is also a good thing. Its just kind of mediocre all  the way through. On the surface its catchy but that wears thin fast. It  never takes any chances or breaks any rules. If you're looking for   something new and interesting look elsewhere.
6303269869|5.0|When I first saw the title of this movie, I was thinking that this was  going to be a romantic comedy.  But, to my surprise, it was so much more.   <br />Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia are good as Alice and Michael Green.  I liked  the fact that the movie dealt with Alice's alcoholism.  She realizes that  she has a major problem with alcohol.  Eventually, she goes into  rehabilitation.<br />I'm glad that they didn't stop the movie with her coming  out of rehab and life will be all wonderful and fuzzy.  What happens is  that with Alice sober, Michael doesn't have anyone to rescue anymore.  It  is good to watch how their relationship changes with Alice's new found  sobriety.  Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia do a great job in showing how  alcoholism can effectively mess up a relationship and family.  <br />It's been  a while since I have seen this movie, but there are some wonderful  supporting performances to mention.  Tina Majorino as the oldest daughter,  Jess, is astonishing.  She shows a lot of emotion for the daughter of an  alcoholic.  I think that she could have easily been nominated for a Best  Supporting Actress Oscar.  <br />Also, Lauren Tom as Amy, the Green's  nanny/housekeeper, is incredible.  Her character does not really like  Michael Green very much.  The scene where Michael begs her to come back and  help the family is great.  Amy definitely does not make it easy for  him.<br />This movie is definitely not light-hearted fair.  In fact, I would  really not recommend this for children.  But, for adults, I recommend this  movie because it tackles alcoholism head on, especially with some not so  pleasant views of Alice's alcoholism.
B0000028VT|5.0|This album is Mariah's best before her downfall into hoochie-ness. Here,  she combined the perfect balance of melody and soul to create one of the  best pop singles every written - Dreamlover. Now, she's got waaay too much  soul and not enough melody.<br />In contrast to the high spirit of Dreamlover,  the remaining tracks on this album that never made it to the radio waves  are incredibly deep and filled with the misery in getting over a loved one  - Music Box, Now That I Know, Never Forget You (go Babyface!!!!), Just to  Hold You Once Again, and All I've Ever Wanted. Each and everyone of them  are unique and fine-tuned in their own way.<br />This album is a must for  every person who has ever fallen in love.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I loved this movie! From the opening credits right down to the supplementary footage included in the DVD, I was entranced. David Fincher  really does stay true to the spirit of the book - with the exception of the  ending (READ THE BOOK). The DVD has deleted scenes, director commentary on  just about everything, and tons of information on how the special effects  were created. <br />Also, Edward Norton gives a spectacular performance  opposite Helena Bonham Carter opposite Brad Pitt in this somewhat violent  ride through the life and times of Tyler Durden. <br />I didn't see this movie  in the theater due to the poor ratings and rumors of it's misogynist  portrayals of women, but how can you expect some ancient closed-minded  critic to understand this movie? <br />I don't want to give away too much, but  lets just say that nothing is what it seems. Nothing. <br />Sure, this movie's  not for everyone, but would you rather watch one of those post-menopausal,  coming of age, mid-life crisis movies? If so, go rent Steel Magnolias. If  you want a scathing attack on consumerism and a look at the perils of  conformity, then you need look no further.
B000023VR6|1.0|When I first listened to this CD, it was alright. But when I started  overplaying Still D.R.E., I was getting sick of it. I don't like the songs  &quot;What's The Difference?&quot;, &quot;B_ _ch N_ _gaz&quot;,   &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot;, and &quot;F_ _ _ You.&quot; The only good  song on this album is the one Dre dedicates to his brother. Bottom line is  though this CD is not worth buying. If you want to buy good Dr. Dre albums,  buy The Chronic and N_ _gaz 4 Life.
B00000K0DT|5.0|I am not sure that a 1,000 words is enough for me to make my feelings felt about this movie. Until this movie, none of the stars of this movie were  household names here, but now they feel like part of the family.<br />Brian  Singer has constructed a masterpiece, in which the punchline resides where  it should, in the last shot! This movie keeps you guessing, and I am  finding it very hard to review without letting some of the better shocks  slip! <br />Baldwin, Spacey and Byrne play career roles in this movie, for  which they will all be remembered. The filming locations are very good, the  musical score superb and the story, although slow burn, moves along at a  perfect pace. The use of flashback, which is a very hard tool to work with,  is used to perfection, with the viewer becoming so engulfed in each scene,  it is a genuine surprise when you are back with the key characters.<br />I  implore anyone reading this review who hasn't seen this movie, to beg,  borrow or buy copy of this from Amazon, and please please please, do not  listen to anyone who would spoil the ending. One thing is sure, when you  watch this movie, you will go to bed asking &quot;Who is Keyser Soze?&quot;  To which the answer is.......
067960085X|4.0|While most people have picked up this book for the short novel  &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot;, they would do well to continue reading.  &quot;Breakfast&quot; is a powerful and fabulously constructed story, rich  with characterization. As a reader, you can't help but fall under her  spell, not unlike the supporting characters in the novel.<br />While the  middle stories are well written, they don't have the punch and pizzaz of  &quot;Breakfast&quot; or the other story which bookends the novel, &quot;A  Christmas Memory&quot;. As strong as &quot;Breakfast&quot; is, it's power  is like that of a cool breeze in comparison to the hurricane that is  &quot;Memory&quot;. It's a life changing story, one that is guaranteed to  reduce to tears even the hardest cynic. The story of a young boy and his  elderly cousin, demonstrates the inherent power of love and family.
B00003CXGG|3.0|This film was given to me by a friend of mine, as the movie doesn't come out in the UK until October at the theatres. I have to say the plot was  pretty good, and Delroy Lindo is excellent. Jet Li is unknown here in the  UK, apart from a role in Lethal Weapon 4. <br />From the trailer, I was  awaiting a kick arse action movie, but action was few and far between.  Flo-Mo wasn't used to good effect, and the movie was a good 20 minutes too  long.<br />Not a bad movie, but one which could have been much better with  very little effort
0783240236|5.0|Excellent. Sharp images&gt;
B000002UCQ|4.0|George, please, please, PLEASE re-master this, your greatest recording!  These songs are just way too good to leave buried under a pile of Spector  mush!!<br />George rocks out on &quot;Wah, Wah.&quot; I love that tune.
0316777722|5.0|In his previous collections, Barrel Fever, Holidays on Ice, and Naked, Sedaris' works have been sometimes hilarious, sometimes disturbing and  grim, and sometimes all three.  His best works, though, were always the  funny essays based on his own life.  (Fortunately, he's weird enough that  this works.)  And in Me Talk Pretty One Day, he shows that he's realized  where his strength lies.<br />The first portion of Me Talk Pretty, prosaically  named One, contains more of his reminisces about his family.  These stories  are often funny, usually with an underlying tension, and their conclusions  are usually wry or bittersweet.  &quot;Go Carolina&quot; is a perfect  example of these, talking about Sedaris' years in speech therapy as a  child, and suggesting that perhaps his parents, teachers, and therapists  were trying to fix something other than just a speech impediment.  <br />Deux,  the other half of the book, concerns Sedaris' life in France, especially  his attempts to learn French.  Most of the essays in Deux are truly  hysterical.  They're the kind of thing where, after a few minutes of  reading, your eyes are tearing up from lack of oxygen and your loved one  has awoken from a sound sleep (probably because the bed was vibrating with  your laughter) and is threatening to call an ambulance or suffocate you  with a pillow.  <br />Deux has attractions in addition to the humor in the  stories.  It's nice to see that Sedaris can write - and write well - about  something other than his screwy childhood and screwed-up history.  Sooner  or later Sedaris is bound to run out of humorous anecdotes about his past,  and Me Talk Pretty is an indication that when he does, he'll still have  good stuff to write about - his present.  In fact, if this book is anything  to go by, Sedaris' works will only improve on that day - in the distant  future, of course - when he puts the past in, well, the past.  <br />(Caveat:  do not read this book in public places unless you enjoy looking like  someone with a major nervous system disorder and a bronchial problem.   Books like this are best enjoyed either by yourself or in the company of  people who have to love you, no matter how strange you look.)
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is undoubtably my favourite Blind Guardian album, and also my  favourite metal album.  It is a grandious project, and in a similar  concept-vein to Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime.  And like Mindcrime, it  could be impossible for Blind Guardian to top!<br />Nightfall is one of the  best heavy, singalong songs I've ever heard.  Whenever I listen to it I  just have to scream it at the top of my voice!<br />If you are a fan of Iced  Earth, Gamma Ray, or Helloween (or if you are a metalhead who loves Tolkein  novels!) you MUST BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00000273M|4.0|There are probably artistically superior Bangles CDs, but that's not  really what Greatest Hits albums are about. For me this album will always  evoke memories of this one particular summer. I was away at art school and  trying really hard not to cheat on my then-boyfriend, so I decided to run  10 miles every day on the indoor track to burn off excess energy, and i  always listened to this album while running. I've always appreciated the  way that the &quot;walk right down your street&quot; song has a rhythm  track deliberately designed to mimic feet hitting pavement...bounce bounce  bounce. Anyway, my strategy completely backfired and I ended up having a  huge crush on this adorable boy in my illustration class, and the Bangles  only exacerbated it. These songs just have that fluttery crush feeling.  &quot;Oooh, I've had sleepless nights...tossing, turning, wake up burning  for what you inspire...&quot; One day illustration boy and I were the last  to leave the classroom. We were gathering up our things, pretending not to  notice, and then our eyes suddenly met and... (cue &quot;Eternal  Flame.&quot; Then flip to &quot;In Your Room.&quot;). I know this sounds  irredeemably cheesy, but if it's been awhile since you last fell in love,  you should buy this album.
B00004T9UF|4.0|After reading all of the negative reviews of the marshall mathers lp, I  had to share my thoughts.  Eminem, whether you like him or not, is one of  the best rappers and lyricists that I know of.  Check out some of his  freestyles if you want proof.  I mean, the depth of his lyrics don't  compare to the likes of Outkast, but they are extremely clever and  perfectly delivered.  This disc is better than the Shady LP in that he  comes out and blatantly tells everyone that he is only kidding.  Come on,  if you can't tell that he is kidding, that's just sad.  Yes, the lyrics are  &quot;dirty&quot;, so no, parents should not let their 12 year old listen  to Eminem.  That's just what Eminem says on this cd.  Everyone just needs  to lighten up and enjoy the music for what it's worth.
0671027344|5.0|A moving handbook of teenage angst, The Perks of Being a Wallflower throws  every emotion from love and anger to hate and pity in the air like a  feather in the wind. The first time reading this book left me floating on a  cloud. So did the second, third, fourth, and fifth time....without a doubt  the best read yet. I highly recommend this darkly comedic drama about a  young boy to any teenager, adult, or senior citizen. This is the one book  out there that will etch in your mind for a lifetime.
B00000163G|5.0|I remember the first day I bought this CD (the day it was released) a chilly february morning in 1996 in uptown Manhatten. When I saw Tupac  throwing up the &quot;Westside&quot; on the cover, I thought it was true  that he had sold out the east coast. I had seen 'Pac at several clubs in NY  and he always had mad love out here but was now claiming Westcoast... When  I popped in the CD though, it became clear that although jail hadn't turned  him into a saint, it had put his music on a whole new level. This is the  album that changed hip hop music almost 180 degrees and every album after  this has tried to match this first rap double CD of original material. This  album is perfect and can be played all the way through- it has 27 tracks of  slammin beats and lyrics. Tupac talks about everything with the best rap  skills ever laid down on record. You've probably heard the singles on this  double CD- California Love, All About U, 2 of Amerika's Most Wanted, How Do  U Want it, I aint mad at cha, etc.... but they are only the beginning of  why this CD is so excellent. Remember I said I bought it the day it came  out-- I still bump it. If you buy one rap CD ever- buy this one. If you are  some new kid that listens to rap and think that DMX and Jay Z are good-  listen to this CD and find out where they all got their ideas. Except  unlike their cds- 2Pac never has a wack song. Too bad he's gone and isn't  still coming with new music.
B000000OUJ|5.0|What can you really say about this album?  It is probably the best of Wu  solo projects to date (maybe that ever will be), focusing heavily on the  essential elements that have brought the Wu-Tang to the forefront of  underground hip-hop.  While most critics favored Raekwon's &quot;Only Built  4 Cuban Linx&quot; for its raw and edgy style, GZA brings quick,  intelligent lyrics on nearly every track.  Just about all the other members  collaborate on one or more songs, and each song tells a small part of the  larger story that is &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;.  You can almost see the GZA  mentally cutting apart all the flash and fakery that has come to dominate  today's rap world - leaving a cold and honest view of his reality.  Various  sound clips that have become a Wu trademark enhance the album, the fitting  quotes from Shogun Assassin illustrate the GZA's lyrical stance.  RZA's  production has never been so tight and mysterious.  Highly recommended.
6300182282|4.0|Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn star as two people each married to other  people who have an affair with each other on one weekend for 26 years.  (Is  there any other way to describe that ?)  Both stars are very good, and have  great chemistry, although Alda's constant whining can grate on some nerves.   As their affair continues, the years pass, and other events in their lives  affect each of them more and more, their own relationship exhibits its own  changes.  A very smart, sweet and touching film, adapted from Bernard  Slade's play.  Listen for the haunting piano theme that is performed  through the film; it will definitely stick with you.
B000002MTU|4.0|Having smoked enough cigarettes to sound legit, EC finally recorded the  blues album.  When I first put it on I was a bit nonplussed.  I had never  heard the over-the-top vocals before out of Clapton.  I had heard most of  the songs by the artists who originally recorded them and I have to admit  that EC does a pretty fair job covering some heroes.  He didn't attempt  Howlin' Wolf (you can't smoke enough to ever get that sound!).  But having  a go at Otis Rush, Elmore James, and Muddy Waters is ambitious enough.   <br />Favorites?  Sinner's Prayer, Groaning the Blues, and Reconsider Baby.   None of these improve Ray Charles, Otis Rush, or Lowell Fulson but all are  very good.  Least favorite is 'Five Long Years', which I thought sounded  goofy coming from Clapton (he was rich at 24 years old!).  If you want to  hear a truly blue Clapton the record is Layla.  A bluer man and bluer  record is hard to imagine.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd rocks!! I bought this cd when I was attached to Limp Bizkit and  rapcore, so I wasn't sure if the whole death-metal genre was for me. After  listening to the first three songs I was blown away. From the constant  screaming in &quot;(Sic)&quot; to the the melodic &quot;Wait and  Bleed&quot; to the fasted paced rap of &quot;Spit it Out,&quot; it's  obvious that the members of Slipknot have gone through intense emotional  torture. At least it came across that way. The band seems to have put most  of their energy into the first six songs, which is why I think they're the  best. Don't get me wrong, I like the rest, I'm just fond of the intensity  of the beginning tracks. It's definitly not for everyone (ex. Britney  Spears fans), but fans of metal won't be disappointed.
B0000025OP|5.0|recorded in 3 or 4 days with admirable support from The Band, this record  has some very strong songs.  Dylan had yet to form the perspective of his  experience that would lead to the next release, Blood on the Tracks, but in  some ways Planet Waves may be a more direct expression.  The goodbye songs,  'Going Going Gone' and 'Forever Young', are as bittersweet as anything  you'll hear.  'Tough Mama' is a terrific rock'n'roll take on playing  around.  'Never Say Goodbye' is one of Dylan's minor masterpieces.  Then  there's the schizophrenic perspective of 'Dirge' and 'Wedding Song'.   <br />Dylan's harp playing fits in surprisingly well with Garth Hudson's  keyboards, which are evocative as always.  Robbie Robertson plays some  great guitar, both acoustic and electric, and was probably the real  producer.
B00004SCX6|3.0|While some of the songs are better than others, clearly as the front insert Brittney has turned into a fake underdressed sex simbol.  What is  the world comming to?  The outfits are an atrocity and most of the lirics  are apalling, but some of the tunes are catchy and make you want to listen.   I agree that in this album, Brittney has sunk to a sub-atomic level.  Her  voice is pretty much that of a machine and all the implants, tatoos,  earings and such have made her a bad example of what a young lady should  look like.  Is this what we want kids today to see?  Someone showing off  their body and singing about sex?  I think not!   In her first album, she  was the girl next door now well I don't want to say it but I will.  She  looks like a prostitute out for a hot evening.  Can't they even find a  shirt to fit her?  I really think Brittney will not make the classics like  the Rolling Stones, Elton John, and Celine Dion.  Her knock off of the  'Satisfaction' song was enough to make the Rolling Stones and Beach Boys  turn over in their graves.  Brittney is just a mechanincal voice and a sack  of silicone not a quality pop star.  She will not make it for another album  unless she fixes her reputation and right now, I really don't know if her  reputation is fixable.  'Pop stars' have turned into shapely blondes with  no voice and sex pushers.  If you want to know the reason for the rise of  the AIDS and other STD viruses, just listen to the pop stars.  Personally,  unless she gets her act together, I will not buy another of her CDs.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|This movie is the best I ever seen in this type. The action is incredible. The sound effect is impressive. There's suspense from the beginning to the  end. The performers are really professional. It's a GOOD MOVIE. I LOVE IT.
B00004W5UA|4.0|I thought this movie would be another hollywood flick where you get a guy girls will drool over and he beats up poeple...WRONG!This movie is so much more than that.It's pretty weird.It's hard to go into the  storyline without ruining the ending.Be advised that some of the fighting  is fairly graphic though.But it brings up a lot of good poins about how  messed up our society is.We rely on TV and Calvin klein ads to tell us what  we have to look like.But we're never gonna be in those ads.We'll never be  tv stars or rock stars.This movie is about a group of guys rebelling  against what society has made for them.Go rent it!

0316777722|5.0|They say that laughter is good for your health.  Read ME TALK PRETTY ONE  DAY and you'll be feeling healthier!  I read this book when I was having a  very bad day and I felt myself starting to guffaw!<br />David Sedaris'  experiences in France and learning to speak French and feeling stilted and  awkward made me laugh!  Thirty years ago I studied French and I remember  the French people correcting me in such a way that seemed humilating at the  time, but pretty funny when I read about David Sedaris' similar  experiences.  I felt like calling him up and saying, &quot;I know just what  you're talking about!&quot;<br />This is the first book that I read of his,  but I'm going to get the rest...  FUNNY!
6300270432|5.0|great movie - i own it on laser disc and would like to get it on dvd and  am ordering on video. great insight into the traditions of the east versus  the west and how the right spirit can move between and through both worlds.  the interweaving of worlds and their mingling throughout the plot is great  to watch unfold. black rain was a poor replica of this. please bring it to  dvd.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I highly recommend purchasing this DVD, especially if you consider yourself a serious film person. There is a 75-minute documentary included  on the second DVD that will teach you just as much about film making as a  class at USC. My opinion: Magnolia is one of the greatest and most  important films ever made. It breaks all conventions, it writes its own  rule-book, and it demands you to accept it upon its own terms. Magnolia is  nothing short of a masterpiece, and like all art that is ahead of its time,  it will take decades for the film to be widely appreciated. As I listen to  some critics harp on about the length and self-indulgence of the film (like  it's a bad thing!), I am reminded of dialogue from the film  &quot;AMADEUS&quot;:<br />Mozart: So then, you liked it? You really liked it,  sire?<br />King: Well, of course I did! It's very good! Of course now and  then... just now and then... it seemed a touch...<br />Mozart: What do you  mean, sire?<br />King: Well, I mean, occasionally, it seems to have... Oh, how  shall one say... How shall one say, Direktor?<br />Direktor: Too many notes,  your Majesty.<br />King: Exactly. Very well put. Too many notes.<br />Mozart: I  don't understand. There are just as many notes, your Majesty, as are  required, neither more, nor less.<br />King: My dear fellow, there are in fact  only so many notes one can hear in an evening. I think I'm right in saying  that, aren't I, Court Composer?<br />Salieri: Yes. On the whole, yes  Majesty.<br />Mozart: This is absurd.<br />King: My dear young man, don't take it  so hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. There are simply too  many notes. Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.<br />Mozart: Which few did  you have in mind, Majesty?
6305910103|5.0|Boy, it's nice to see the original crew in all their glory. Still in good  shape, at the height of their acting powers.<br />Star Trek II has action,  intrigue and a nice tip of the hat to the original series featuring the old  villain, Khan, played by Ricardo Montalban. I hadn't seen this film in  years when I bought the DVD and I was amazed at how well the special  effects held up. We've become a bit spoiled with digital effects these days  and it's nice to see that we weren't just kidding ourselves when we thought  the effects in films like Star Trek II and Aliens were good. They are!<br />ST  II is one of the more heart-wrenching of the Trek films as well. For those  two or three of you out there who haven't seen it or know about it, I won't  spoil the ending.<br />The DVD's special features, while not plentiful, are  good. And the reproduction is top notch. I highly recommend this version of  the film.
B00004U8H4|5.0|What really impresses me in this movie is the main character. Ever since Ive red the book I`m completely in love with Patrick Bateman. Hes the  hottest guy ever!
B00004VVNB|5.0|Yes, Logan's Run is a bit dated. Most movies don't stand the test of time. There are too many contemporary cultural references in most movies to avoid  this. And Logan's Run is no exception.<br />However, for quality of story,  acting and action, Logan's Run is still excellent. The characters are  engaging and they develop depth as the story proceeds. Many of the themes  are timeless. Our youth-oriented culture, ecological disaster and fear of  government are just a few of the elements presented here.<br />Up until Star  Wars, Logan's Run was in select company as far as science fiction went.  Perhaps only 2001 surpassed it prior to 1977. I still count this film among  my top 20 or so favorites of all time and very highly recommend it.
B000002AP1|5.0|Although it's not The Stooges best, Raw Power is better than a lot of  Iggy's solo material. Very essential stuff here. &quot;I Need  Somebody&quot; and &quot;Penetration&quot; are the best.
B00004U45G|5.0|Lo, these many years past...I attended Robert Plant's first solo tour  performance in support of his newly released, &quot;Pictures At  Eleven&quot;. The warm-up act was someone I'd never heard of before, but  someone that I had heard Robert rant and rave about in interviews. It was  the Black Crows! Back in the early 80's!<br />Both Jimmy and Robert were into  these guys LONG before anyone else was. Not only is it not surprising that  these musicians pool their talents to produce this incredible piece of  work, but it also attests to how, since Zep landed in 1980, these two major  influences in modern music lend a hand to help the new kids on the block.  <br />At far as &quot;Live At The Greek&quot; is concerned, this is a  remarkable recording, from the audiophile's point of view. The bottom end  of it, the bass and drums, will shake you to the point of liver quiver.  From a Zep or Crows fan point of view, it's staggering. Jimmy took the  Crows under his wing and whispered in their ear, &quot;C'mere guys...I'm  gonna show you how to grab the keys to the kingdom&quot;. Because this is  as good a live recording as you're ever gonna hear, it points to the fact  that Jimmy had their complete and full attention. When Jimmy Page takes the  time to choose YOU from everyone else to educate.....it's in your best  interest to listen. They did......and this is the result.<br />Of course,  Jimmy is gonna keep the spotlight. He nails each and every piece to the  deck. Every single one. The tracks off Physical Graffitti never sounded so  good, better than the originals. &quot;Shapes Of Things&quot;, that great  Yardbirds tune knocked me out and made me laugh out loud. What a great nod  to past material. Selection of material on this disc...as pointed out in  earlier reviews is excellent. &quot;Black Dog&quot; or &quot;Rock 'n  Roll&quot; would have raised this recording to the &quot;legendary&quot;  level. But as it is...do yourself a favor. Obtain this recording and write  your own review. I bet it sounds a lot like mine!
B000002MZ9|2.0|Before I got Mirror Ball, the only Neil Young cd I had was After The Gold  Rush. I was interested in his rock music, so I got this. I was expecting a  grunge masterpiece like everyone was describing, but I got a  disappointment. If you've heard one song on here, then you've basically  heard all of them. Sure there are plently of people who like this album,  but check out the other reviews...maybe you will turn out to be one of the  people that will be disappointed with Mirror Ball. Buy Neil's other albums  before you think of getting this. It's not all bad...&quot;I'm The  Ocean&quot; is really good, but the album doesn't live up to just about  everything else that Neil Young has done.
B000002HPV|5.0|If you listen to music for complete emotional engagement ... if you easily tire of the same old styles rehashed and monotony ... if you are looking for music that drifts into your mind like a friendly little space probe exploring all different angles of Life... and if you enjoy listening to that same music over and over again: listen to Björk.<br />Since \\"Debut\\", her music has definitely stood in a class completely separate from her work with the Sugarcubes (which I liken to fun and zany party music not unlike the B-52's). So, if you disliked them, please note: her solo work is NOT the same animal.<br />\\"Homogenic\\" has a more homogeneous sound than her former albums due to Mark Bell's influence.  This less-eclectic sound thread initially makes for a more minimal feel than the fan used to \\"Debut\\" and \\"Post\\" first expects. This is her first less-hands-in-the-pot, more-Björk influenced album; and, her conscientiousness toward the music is in clear evidence:  it's unusual and thick.  The sound is darker, mysterious, extremely emotional, cathartic, and achingly beautiful ... with no regrets.  This is an album about emotional pain (such as on \\"5 Years\\") -- but also healing, as special tracks \\"All Neon-Like\\" and \\"All Is Full of Love\\" well communicate.  Other standouts are \\"Joga\\" - a beautiful song about an intimate friendship, and the oft-\\"Bolero\\"-compared, prowling \\"Hunter\\".<br />The explosive \\"Pluto\\" is packed with power.  I initiated laughed at it because of all her screaming.  However, I was quickly converted and it's now one of my favorites she's ever done!  Each time I listen to it, I envision the ecstatic and intensely creating-and-destroying nuclear reactions within a fast-spinning star - or even a supernova. Talk about opening up and exploding off everything that's outworn and stifling and becoming something precious, perfect and new. Mythically-speaking, it's purely Plutonian! And, it's swiftly succeeded by the ambient \\"All Is Full of Love\\" = think of color andhyperbolic swirling shapes, spherical shiny sparkles slowly drifting in midair ... Anyone who thinks they need drugs to see these kinds of things needs to sober up and listen to Björk!<br />But to find satisfaction in these songs, you must be willing to take a bite ... will you?
B000001ESP|5.0|I just put this on again a few weeks ago through my new B.I.C. Venturi speakers, and could not believe the sound.  This production job is incredibly warm and clear, and compliments the playing and writing to a tee.  \\"The Camera Eye\\" is Rush's best song ever--bar none. YYZ, Red Barchetta, Limelight, and Witch Hunt are also among their best.  The whole album smokes with the proper intensity of a rock band not just \\"on top of\\", but annihilating, their game. One of the most amazing albums EVER recorded.  Enough said.
0792156684|3.0|Cuando vi la entrega de los oscar y asombrado observe como se llevaba tantas y tantas estatuillas esta pelicula pense que debia ser algo  extraordinario, algo que te dejara impactado despues de verla, algo digno  de ser contado y recomendado a tus amigos. Es cierto, uno tiene sus gustos  y el mio tira para el lado de la accion mas que para el romance, pero  pueden gustarme peliculas de muchas clases si me llegan al corazon. Sin  embargo luego de gastarme casi 3 horas (sino recuerdo mal) mirando esta  pelicula realmente me di cuenta de como el negocio puede muchas veces mas  que el arte, porque una pelicula que en algunos puntos (no en todos por  Dios, tiene muchas cosas muy, pero muy buenas) es estremadamente cursi e  irreal.<br />Bueno, es una pelicula que hay que ver, porque debido a la gran  (y exagerada) cantidad de estatuillas que gano es ya parte de la historia  del cine. Sin embargo, estoy bastante ofuscado por haber gastado dinero y  haberla comprado en DVD, si la hubiese visto antes sin duda no lo habria  hecho.<br />Al mirarla y ver como Braveheart (siempre la uso como ejemplo  porque me encanta) gano solo 5 estatuillas me doy cuenta que el tema de la  entrega de los oscar es algo falso y que se mueve mas por el dinero que por  la calidad de los films.

B00003CXFU|4.0|I liked Erin Brockovich.  Julia Roberts and Albert Finney gave excellent performances and Steven Soderbough did a terrific job directing.  the  script was excellent.  i just don't know what it was about the movie.   there's something missing to it.  it's the something in a script that makes  a best picture winner-a best picture winner.  if u read some of the other  reviews you will see the same thing. As for the film itself? It was  enjoyable.  Julia Roberts will be walking home with an academy award  NOMINATION for her dazzling performance as Erin Brockovich, the bad mouthed  and trashy clothed mom who desperately goes for a job at a law firm.    while there she seeks information on a case involving water contamination.

B000002MIF|5.0|This album came before &quot;the Queen is Dead&quot; and really does show  how good the group was as a singles band, with some of the best songs of  the 80's found on this album. There are many songs on this that appear on  their eponymous debut album but these versions are much more direct and  nervy, it also contains many tracks found on no other Smiths album.  While  &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot; feels like a progressive album, one that  creates it's own shape as it goes along, Hatful of Hollow takes you on a  rollercoaster of styles and tempos that just delight your pallete and  frankly, without the track listing, it's very hard to predict when the  album will actually finish.  What makes this album so appealing however is  the brilliance of the famous &quot;Morrissey and Marr&quot; duo which  creates a vivid image of an adolescent childhood we can all relate to at  one time or another almost listening to our most painful tales of  lonliness, frustrtation and feeling of abandonment.  As &quot;how soon is  now&quot; says:  &quot;so you go and you stand on your own, and you leave  on your own, and you go home and you cry and you want to die&quot;.  How  many of us have felt like that i wonder?  But apart from the imagery, the  music is quite brilliant with jangly guitars the main order of the day with  flashes of girl group styilings on &quot;heaven knows i'm miserable  now&quot; the sweet rush of &quot;william it was really nothing&quot; and  the masterpiece &quot;how soon is now&quot; which can't fail to touch every  one of us in some way. What also appears in this album is the very  competent playing of Andy Rourke on bass which helps support Marrs ringing  guitars perfectly.  It's not quite as cohesive or as vivid as &quot;the  Queen is dead&quot; but nevertheless contains some of the best music of the  80's by any band at all.  A must have.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|If you are searching for one heavy metal album this year to buy, then your  search has ended.  Iron Maiden has once again come forth with a great new  album, and the band have really put alot of time and effort into it. First,  let me just say that I am very proud that Bruce and Adrian have come back  to the band.  Out of prior singers Paul and Blaze, Bruce is without a doubt  the greater of the three.  Adrian is also a master of soloing, as he has  performed on Bruce's solo albums 'Accident of Birth' and 'The Chemical  Wedding', and I am very happy that Iron Maiden now has three smokin'  guitarists.  Before I get into explaining my opinion of 'Brave New World',  I would like to say something to all of the fans out there, new and old.   Iron Maiden, over the last few years (or since 'No Prayer for the Dying',  anyway), has caught alot of criticism from people because of guitarist  Janick Gers.  You all seem to want to beat this man for one reason or  another, and some of you even think that either Dave or Adrian are better  guitarists than he.  This may be true, as it all depends on how you see it,  but you disrespect the band as a whole when you point fingers at other band  members for taking him in.  I would think that Steve wouldn't have accepted  him into the band if he wasn't that good, and yes Janick does like to act  cocky when he is up on stage, as I have seen with my own eyes, but just  accept the fact that he is with Maiden, and he is a superb guitarist. Now,  you wanted my opinion of 'Brave New World'. First off, if you are a  die-hard, life-long fan like I, and have listened to their entire catalog,  you will notice that there are some similarities between their older  material and 'Brave New World'.  Alot of the chords that they use are  somewhat similar to ones used on previous albums, such as the first track  'The Wicker Man'.  Here is a song, a great one at that and also their first  single off of the album, that can be compared to other songs such as 'Aces  High' (from 'Powerslave'), 'Be Quick or Be Dead' (from 'Fear of the Dark'),  and 'Tailgunner' (from 'No Prayer for the Dying').  The chords in any of  these songs are played quite fast, and the soloing moves at a pretty rapid  pace.  If you listen to 'Blood Brothers', this one reminds me of 'Sign of  the Cross' (from 'The X Factor').  It begins with a slow moving chord  segment in a clean sound, and then as it is played a little faster, the  distortion is turned up, and the boys start to rock.  My reason for the  comparison of these two songs is that they both start off slow, pick up  during the vocals, and then drop the noise and then head back to a  ballad-type feel.  The title track, 'Brave New World', is like 'Blood  Brothers', using the same format of going from single-noted ballads to  crunching power chords.  I like to think of the track 'Dream of Mirrors' as  sounding like one of Bruce's solo songs entitled 'Change of Heart' (from  'Balls to Picasso').  'Change of Heart' uses mainly acoustic guitars while  'Dream of Mirrors' uses electric ones, however the two sound the same in  terms of playing style, as the two are moderate songs.  The song that I  really like the more I listen to it is 'The Nomad'.  This is a great tune  that, if you've listened to the 'Powerslave' album before, you can hear  some similarities.  The track starts off with several smashing chords  played behind a catchy solo.  I like 'The Nomad' because it goes from a  hard-hitting sound to a soft melody. 'Brave New World' is an album that can  be played over and over again, but you won't tire from it.  There are maybe  one or two Maiden albums that I consider my favorites, but in my mind  'Brave New World' is on top.  The way the entire band works together in  accomplishing this album was phenomenal.  Some may say that it is just like  some of their older material, which may be true.  However, you can tell the  difference between this and their older material.  You might hear somesame  chord changes and progressions, some solos of the past, or a prior drumming  technique(s).  But with 'Brave New World', they have gone and done  something unique.  They have taken some older material, mixed it in with  the new, and the result was a deadly album.  I highly recommend it to  anybody, those who have been with Maiden since the early days or those just  starting to get into Maiden (because it will give you a feel of what they  are about).  I also recommend seeing them live if they haven't passed by  your state yet.  I went and saw them at Madison Square Garden on August 5,  2000 in New York City, in front of an audience that bought the entire place  out after just a few hours of ticket sales.  Rob Halford, former vocalist  for Judas Priest opened for them, followed by Queensryche.  All three bands  put on a spectacular show. I would like to thank Iron Maiden for creating  some of the best music of the last few decades.  You guys may have not been  noticed by many people in the U.S., but keep in mind that you have  thousands and thousands of fans who will always continue to support you.  I  wish you luck on the rest of the Brave New World Tour 2000, and keep those  great ideas of yours coming.  I am highly anticipating your next album.
B000002J09|5.0|Considering there are only eight songs on this album, it's simply  astonishing how much purpose and importance this album had to modern music.  Even though &quot;Stairway to heaven&quot; is the obvious favourite track,  the album would be nothing without consistently brilliant tunes which  interweave between the multi-layered &quot;black dog&quot; the bombastic  &quot;rock and roll&quot;, into the eiree folk of &quot;the battle of  evermore&quot; with haunting vocals from sandy denny, i need say nothing  about the next track. &quot;Misty mountain hop&quot;, revels with hippy  satire, &quot;four sticks&quot; is simply funky to the core, &quot;going to  California&quot; is a truly great folk song, especially one that comes from  what is not essentially a folk band and then there's the urban blues of  &quot;when the levee breaks&quot;......and that's it. it ends as soon as it  begins, before you know where you are the album has come to the end and  frankly you just wish that it could go on for longer, but alas, the  greatest albums are the ones that make you beg for more and this my friends  is such an album.  A modern masterpiece
0060920084|5.0|I rather like Bill's writing style and lets face it when it comes to  humourous travel writing Mr Bryson is a genius.  Before setting out to  comment on this book I read a sample of the reviews already penned and what  a disappointment!  I note the reviews are mainly by Americans who, some of  them it would seem, have taken it all a little too seriously, have lost the  plot, and quite obviously dont take to criticism.<br />The human race and this  rock we call Earth is diverse and varied and Mr Bryson has had the immense  fortune to have swallowed a large chunk of it.  This book is penned in his  own inimitable style and reflects his own personal views/opinion, which we  are all entitled to give and should respect.  I like the way he seems to  stand back and with time seemingly to have been slowed to an imperceptible  pace he captures all the myriad foibles and characteristics of the American  way of life.  So what if America is loud, brash and over commercialised,  dont ya just love it! I'd love to see the waitresses with beehive hairdo's,  the awful, mind numbing television shows, the small town tacky museums, the  endless plains and digitless/limbless farmers of Iowa - all so I could say  &quot;yup Billy boy, yer were right&quot;.  I rather think dear old Mr  Piper got a hard deal seeing as he is now pushing up the daises but maybe  the good lord thought that the Brysons had suffered enough.<br />I am  fortunate to live in Yorkshire, England where Bill lived for 20 years and  is quite obviously where he got his zest for life.  I have been enjoyed  America's enchanting character many times and I love her just the way she  is - may she never change.  This book is a dammed good read, it kept me  gripped from the word go and its a crying shame that any criticisms appear  here at all.  Buy the book, dont have any preconceptions, read it through  Mr Bryson's eyes and enjoy the finest piece of narrative I have digested in  a long while!
B000002JSN|5.0|In terms of the feel of this album, this is the pole oppisite of ZOSO in  almost every way. However it still remains zeppelins most powerful  statement and probably the &quot;must have&quot; of their collection  (personally i beleive that all their albums previous to this are  essential). The first side shows zeppelin at their most wildly adventurous,  sounding like they are enjoying their place as rock gods somewhat, playing  with both ease and conviction throughout the first side like no other band  could dream of doing.  &quot;Custard Pie&quot; is a real rootsy blues song  with a tihtly wounded riff, sounding like something from &quot;Led Zeppelin  II&quot; with a little more sprawl.  &quot;The Rover&quot; is truly the  song that shows zeppelin are consolidating their position as the leaders of  rock with a classic, pulsating, adventurous rhythm matched by Plant's  poingant lyrics.  &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is a very well constructed  &quot;pop song&quot; (there is said it) which nevertheless sounds lean and  tough thanks to the brilliant playing on the song.  &quot;Trampled  underfoot&quot;  shows zeppelin stretching out their funk roots where  &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; (the album, not the song) left off with a  little more character than what it's predecessor showed.  And then there's  the undeniably classic &quot;Kashmir&quot; which puts zeppelin at a peak  that they would never reach again.  The Eastern influence in the song with  the carefully worked out composition makes it probably the most adventurous  song that they ever did, but adventurous doesen't always make for a good  song, in this case however, it succeeds in a way that you can't  imagine.<br />The second side is a different kettle of fish altogether though,  the ordering of the tracks is not as tight or as thoughtful as on zeppelins  earlier releases, but then again that was kinda the point of it,they were  essentially cleaning out the vaults with some very fine inclusions within  thenine songs on the second side, none more so affecting than &quot;ten  Years Gone&quot; which is heart rendering and emotional in a way that was  unthinkable of zeppelin at the start of their career.  The rest of the  second side moves almost as well and does give a fully rounded listen that  makes for a sprawling, definitive and ultimately classic piece of work.   Zeppelin never made an album as good as this again and stands alone as the  most ambitious and rewarding piece of work that they ever did. A  masterpiece
0553269631|5.0|Quite beyond the fact that Carson McCullers was only 23 when she wrote this, her first novel, she must be congratulated for having constructed  such a diverse group of entirely engrossing characters.  Several earlier  reviewers have lamented the lack of &quot;meaning&quot; in this novel.  If  meaning is what you look for in your literature, then perhaps &quot;The  Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; may not be for you.  If, rather, you read  novels for the emersion into other worlds and introduction to thought  provoking characters that they can provide, then be sure to pick up a copy  of this work.        The novel follows several characters in the deep South  of the early 1940's (before the US gets into the war).  Though these  characters have almost nothing in common:  Jake, a drunkard and frustrated  Communist, Biff, the observant owner of the New York Cafe with a soft spot  for &quot;freaks&quot;, Mick, a reclusive and thoughtful girl at the cusp  of puberty, and Dr. Copland, the town's educated and ideological black  physician, their lives are each intertwined with that of Jake Singer, a  deaf-mute whose silent understanding allows each of the four to attribe to  him the character that he or she desires.      The novel, being written in  1940, also provides the reader with some insight into the attitudes of  Americans to the rise of Fascism in Europe in the thirties and the  conditions of African-Americans in the period just prior to the civil  rights movement of the fifties and sixties.  Altogether an easy and  enjoyable read.
B000007T1M|5.0|It is the best hard rock I have ever heard. THE BEST. Their beat and lyrics are really powerful  and I have never heard anything like it. I can't wait till they release  their next album.   SUGAR.
B00003Q43A|3.0|Ah, if it only had a brain.  The extended cut does make a couple of things a tiny bit more sensible, but they still don't wash, they really don't.  Best to just lay back and let this spectacle roll over you -- if you get  critical, then you miss the fun elements (and there are plenty) and you  might as well ditch this and go watch a Bergman or Woody Allen flick.  It's  big, it's loud, it's stupid, and people love it for exactly the reason that  they love the circus, or fun fair, or roller coasters, or even  Disneyland.<br />Contrary to another reviewer's comments, the picture quality  is excellent, with superb mastering, a high bitrate, smooth seamless  branching in the special edition, and even a blipless layer switch on my  Toshiba SD1200.  The sound is terrific, with rock-the-house lows and some  marvelous surround work.  The extras, meanwhile, are okay -- disc two is  more so-so than I'd like, but does have some good features.  I would have  liked an isolated score track on that second disc, though -- that was a  highlight of the Patton set.  The Emmerich/Devlin commentary is a hoot,  because neither of them are po-faced about their work, and the irreverence  is refreshing.  The visual effects commentary is quite the opposite -- a  serious and engaging discussion that should be listened to several times by  aspiring VFX techs, wannabe directors, and even screenwriters aiming to  create a blockbuster sci-fi (as opposed to science fiction) event.  In the  real world, as part of a seminar, that second track would cost you serious  money.<br />Why three stars?  Because the DVD rates about a 4 and the movie  itself around a 2.  I think I'll keep mine for a while, and not just for  the kids, either.
0780626478|5.0|I had never heard of this movie and chanced upon it at a local video  store.  What a find!  Brendan Fraser is such a great actor, and his  portrayl of the winsome, wholesome Adam Webber is another pure winner.  His  boyishness and naivete is so charming you almost wish you could meet  something who has been hidden from the &quot;real&quot; world for 35 years  yourself.<br />Like some of the critics I was disappointed in Alicia  Silverstone's performance but ultimately it did not detract from the  enjoyment of the movie and Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken were just  fabulous as the parents.<br />I won't elaborate on the story as most of the  other comments seem to have already done this but all I can say is if you  are looking for a pure fun movie, this is thorougly enjoyable and the dance  sequence is a classic.
B00001X590|5.0|I have the old one, the one without the extra tracks.  I fell in love with  Joe's music watching Woodstock, then bought this album. Someone ripped it  off in 1970 (broke into our apartment on Capitol Hill), so I bought it  again.  Then I bought the CD.  Jimmy Page's solo on Bye Bye Blackbird is  haunting.  Windwood's organ on Dylan's I Shall Be Released blends  beautifully with  Henry McCullough's guitar work.  Every track is good. You  will not be disappointed.
0767817478|5.0|i like godzilla <br />godzilla is king of monsters past and future
B00003CXFG|4.0|I went into this film with NO expectations, and was very happily entertained.  Pitch Black echoes many, many other sci-fi movies, but has a  unique tone that sets it apart. Vin Diesel has a definite screen presence  that the director exploits to good effect.  The final half hour has some  nice tense moments.  With the scarcity of good, serious horor/sci- fi  nowadays, I highly reccommend this one to genre fans.
0316779237|5.0|The holidays bring out something truly special in David Sedaris, making this more a &quot;best of&quot; than a mere holiday book.  It's simply  brilliant and, as many reviewers have experienced, one of those rare books  that may cause you to laugh out loud in spite of yourself.  Its only flaw  is that it's a short book, but in content it's a giant.<br />Avid NPR  listeners will instantly recognize the first essay in this book,  &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;; the author's reading of that story is their  single most requested encore.  His description of becoming a Christmas Elf  at Macy's is a true guilty pleasure; scathingly unkind and screamingly  funny.  If you ever held an undignified job, this is somehow your story -  even if you never (pardon the pun) stooped so low as to play an  elf.<br />Sedaris writes like a post-modern Mark Twain, with a dry and  piercing wit that drips with charm and cynicism in equal measure.  His is  the kind of writing that makes me go back to re-read a sentence, a  paragraph, even a whole story hoping to savor some particular gem I only  wish I'd written.  His tone is often dark, even bleak, but there's a wry  quality in his stories that lets you know he's really doing it all for  effect - setting you up for an even bigger laugh because you know he's  enjoying every minute of telling his sad, hilarious stories.<br />Get in on  his story now so you can savor the feeling of waiting impatiently for his  next book - and there's no better way to start than to read Holidays on  Ice.
B00003Q438|5.0|I positively love this movie, perhaps because of the love story that runs  through it, perhaps because of the notes of hope and sacrifice.  Sure, some  of the SEALs plotline is a bit tedious, but I don't care -- there are so  many moments that are breathtaking.  I am nowhere near as impressed by  Cameron's TITANIC or even TERMINATOR 2 as with this film.<br />The extras are  well worth the investment, too, with behind the scenes pieces,  documentaries, easter eggs galore.  Picture quality is close to excellent,  sound quality is superb, and the seamless branching works smoothly on both  my Toshiba SD1200 and my Creative Encore player.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Limp Bizkit made it's blank debut in the alternative music world with their first CD Three Dollar bill Yall$.  They went unnoticed and ignored  for about a year and a half.  Nobody really ever paid much attention to  Limp Bizkit, until they released their power metal cover of George  Michael's humdrum hit Faith.  After the song got proper airplay, people  started to listen.  The first CD is packed with cussing sprees, screaming,  loud hard rock, and tons of bitter ranting.  Significant other contains  some of the same.  Only now, lead singer Fred Durst's sprees and rantings  are boosted by scornful reasoning and a new powerful punch.  He is now  driven by a bitter motivation, that which was not present in Three Dollar  Bill yall$.  On this CD, Durst &amp; Company ditch much of the useless  screaming and mind muddling noise that made them one of America's most  hated groups.  This CD is a rap-metal masterpiece in all it's gloom and  punching.  Nookie &amp; Break Stuff contain earth-shaking choruses that  will rock your mind till' your brains rot out and die.  \\"It's just one of  those days\\" says Fred Durst on Break Stuff, the song we can all relate to  in multiple forms. I'm Broke offers a hilarious stab at a college  poster-boy antics anthem that gives all of the depressed teen couples a new  retaliation device.  Show Me What You Got &amp; No Sex are also tracks that  illustrate this masterpiece LP.  With everything from alternative pop  ballads (re arranged &amp; no sex) to lyrical mosh anthems (show me what  you got &amp; break stuff), this CD has it all, and the good words don't  stop there (they never will).  The biggest problem with Significant Other,  is that there is not enough of it.  However, this CD offers no optimism to  all the Bizkit haters present in our growing society today, especially the  easy-listening battle lords feeding off of mellow sideshows like The  Pretenders, The Sundays, &amp; Abba.  But for many (such as myself), Limp  Bizkit prove thatthey really are worth all the hype and glamour that has  been bestowed upon them.
6305922748|5.0|This Is Spinal Tap was released in 1984 and is an excellent protrayal (and hillarious look at) the rise and fall of a rock band. Nigel Tufnel, David  St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls (Spinal Tap) are documented for 1 year. From  18 inch Stonehenges, to combusting drummers...this &quot;rock or mock-  umentary&quot; is one of the most hillarious films of all time. It is being  re-released on September 12th and is a must see.....You'll just have to see  it for yourself to discover one of the greats in movie history.
B000002JEV|2.0|I am a 15 year old and just discovering Led Zeppelin.  The first music of  theirs' I purchased was the three cd remasters set.  I loved it and still  do, but I was curious to know how they sounded live.  It's completely  different and I don't like it at all.  Stairway to Heaven is my favorite  song and this version butchered it!  There are certain types of music that  sound a lot better live, but Led is not among them.  Stick to studio  albums.  I can see how more hardcore fans might enjoy this, but it's not  for me.
630476524X|1.0|The only thing this pathetic film has in common with the first 'Crow' film is the name - And it insults that name. Stupid plot and stupid acting make  it a complete disaster. Avoid this thing.
B000002AGE|5.0|Weather Report was one of the first fusion bands.  The founders, Joe  Zawinul &amp; Wayne Shorter both played with Miles Davis on some of his  fusion efforts.  They released a few very good albums, but hit their peak  with Heavy Weather.  Combining jazz, rock, soul and latin rhythms, the  album reaches out to many different audiences.  It has a strong commercial  appeal, but it doesn't compromise any of the band's musical integrity.  The  playing is smooth and easy, with bassist Jaco Pastorius particularly  standing out.  His bass provides the album's backbone and shows why he was  truly one of music's best.  Listen to his work on &quot;Birdland&quot; and  &quot;Harlequin&quot; and you'll see why.  Heavy Weather is a must for any  jazz fan and is a great introduction for anyone not familiar with the  artform.
B000000H64|5.0|as the cover shows you, fear factory has a backbone, unlike alternative,  which is slowly dying off. if you have a backbone, listen to this and   pitch all that spineless alternative into the  nearest dumpster where it  belongs. the future is here in METAL!!!!!!!!
B00001NFCY|1.0|Creed led by Scott Stapp are swimming in between hard rock, religious  rock, and pop music, and that is bad news.  Their major label debut My Own  Prison was much more impressive and actually passed off as a good CD.  What  If is the heaviest packeged song on Human Clay with a tediously reptitive  chorus that doesn't seem to have a meaning at all.  What if what?  He  doesn't actually say that in the song, which is extremely dissapointing.   When Higher first hit the radio I was ready to give Creed another chance.   Then, I realized how shallow the music was that I was hearing and I could  tell that this CD was going to be a party pooper.  You have to give Stapp  credit for With Arms Wide Open, a song he wrote for his son, Jagger.  It's  a nice idea, but in the end it's a bad one.  Creed's failure doesn't stop  there.  The song lyrics, the guitar tones, the licks, and drum beats sound  alike too much of the time.  The overall effect is Marilyn Manson &amp;  Godsmack if they were actually religious.  A little Creed never hurt  anyone, but too much of them will make you puke out pity.  Scott Stapp  should save his voice for his son, because that's much more important and  is not a waste of time.
B00001QEE2|5.0|This movie is enjoyable from the Charleton Heston opening to the final word from Hades.  I loved almost every aspect of it.  The music is  fantastic, especially Meg's song, though gospel haters will be covering  their ears.  The art is very stylized and unrealistic, which fits the plot  and setting.  With the exception of Hercules, all of the characters are  interesting and three dimensional.  (Notably the first Disney film to have  an interesting heroine, in my opinion.)<br />Special note to adults: There may  be a fair amount of slapstick, but there's considerable subtle humor as  well.  Keep your eyes and ears open.<br />If you try not to compare Disney's  version to the more traditional Hercules accounts, you'll have a good time.   I heartily recommend this movie.
6303972810|2.0|I wanted to love this movie, but I just couldn't. The brainchild of Mr.  Star Wars himself, George Lucas, 'Willow', while certainly ambitious,  struck me as anemic and derivative. I think the thing that surprised me the  most was the seemingly clumsy steering of [director] Ron Howard. Perhaps he  was overwhelmed by the scale of the story, I don't know. So anyway, Willow,  farmer and dwarf, finds infant Elora (babies Ruth and                          Kate Greenfield as &quot;Willow's&quot; most believable performers)  abandoned at the river's edge --                         she's being hidden  from wicked Queen Bavmorda. Willow's mission (other than inducing                          listlessness) is to deliver babe to the good castle of Tir  Asleen, where she can fulfill her destiny to                         bring  about Queen Bav's downfall. Willow gets help from two Lilliputian-sized  Brownies (Kevin                         Pollak and Rick Overton),  less-willing help from cranky swordsman Madmartigan (an                          enthusiastic but unoriginal Val Kilmer) and resistance from Bavmorda's  Nockmaar army. Of                         course a big finale with Queen B.  breweth. <br />Obviously, Lucas reworks his own myth as well as integrating  The Hobbit and The Bible into this movie. The special FX are decent, but  the story is way too formula no matter how well the sets are dressed.
6305252521|5.0|Just amazing methaphore about life, reality, our fears, frustrations and  struggle for redemption... Im speechless. Jim Carrey shines, Ed Harris is  brilliant as excentric Cristof, Peter Weir does an excellent Job as  director. Cant believe it wasnt even nominated for the Oscars, one of  best films of 1998.  And the ending is deeply emotional. Watch this movie!
1559408855|5.0|It's no wonder that this movie stirs up passions.  It's very graphic and  it's not for faint-hearted.  But in my opinion it's less cruel than some  Terrentino movies, like Reservoir Dogs, for instance.  In terms of graphic  representation of cruelty, it's not even close to some modern movies. The  difference is that it has that horrifying suspense - you don't know what  will be in the next scene; it's a very sophisticated movie.  Also, this  film contains an important message - that everyone there is a victim - the  governors, the guards and not just the victims/youths.  There are no  positive characters; maybe only 2 youths who got killed earlier in the  movie when trying to escape or for praying to God.  I think the purpose  was to show what lower depth a human being can reach,  torturers with  inventing new tortures, guards being stone-hearted and &quot;just doing  their job&quot;, and victims themselves who gradually turn into obedient  sheep where there is no human dignity left.  They try to fight for favours  from the governors/torturors and any trace of pride is gone; they've turned  into animals as well.  It takes a while to stomach this movie and to  decide for yourself what the author wanted to say.  It is not a simplistic  film where all thr answers are suggested.  It's not a romantic kind of  movie, too, so skip if you look for pure light-minded entertainment.  By  the way, it was not directed by Pasolini, but by his long-time assistant.
B00000JW8C|5.0|This cd is one of the best session cds ive ever heard. The music is mostly  albert's material, with pride and joy sung by stevie.The music is great and  the playing is fantastic they had a deffinet chemistry together, one that i  wish could have continued, had fate not taken over.In my oppion they where  simply the best at what they did. BUY IT NOW AND ENJOY.
B000002KGT|5.0|In the past, I've felt that I've been justifying in never awarding any  record five stars. This is due to the fact that many great albums do  contain a lot of silly, inane filler. Even some of the all-time best rock  albums ever, such as Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and  &quot;The Wall,&quot; and The Beatles' &quot;White Album&quot; contain  ridiculous tracks that I find myself skipping past time and time again.  &quot;Rumours,&quot; however, is one of those rare accomplishments where I  can actually listen through the whole album (and I find myself stringing  together the two 23-year-old vinyl copies I have to listen straight through  without having to flip the record over).<br />The underlying concept of the  record is pretty simple. Three relationships between band members (or  others, in the case of Mick and Sarah Fleetwood) were breaking up around  1976 and 1977. The album records the experiences of the band's members  throughout the relationships and the subsequent fallout. It's not a totally  dark piece of breakup rock a la Husker Du's incomparable &quot;Candy Apple  Grey,&quot; however. Songs like Christine McVie's &quot;Songbird&quot; and   &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; go far toward explaining the significant  upsides a relationship can have. Also, Lindsey Buckingham's &quot;Go Your  Own Way&quot; does away with quite a bit of the bitterness one would expect  after a tumultuous breakup.<br />Still, two songs in particular speak to me  and cement &quot;Rumours&quot; place as a truly great album, namely Stevie  Nicks' &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and &quot;The Chain,&quot; a  collaborative effort among all the band members. These songs testify to the  sheer emotional trauma created by the end of a relationship. Certainly  anyone who has ever been hurt by someone he thought he loved can understand  what Nicks was saying when she wrote: &quot;Did she make you cry, Make you  break down, Shatter your illusions of love? Is it over now, And do you know  how, To pick up the pieces and go home?&quot;<br />Ultimately, anyone who has  ever been in a relationship, and especially anyone who has ever been hurt  by one, ought to buy &quot;Rumours.&quot; It's a good investment.
B000001IPL|5.0|Myself being a punk rock fan, I have a wide knowledge of punk music, and I  must say that this has to be the best punk album ever.  The great guitars  and bass mixed with Dexter's really cool vocals make this a winner.  This  was the Offspring's breakthrough album, and not many people know this, but  the Offspring have been around since 1987.  While Dexter's voice isn't all  that great, it certainly adds to the overall effect of the album.  Noodles  guitar playing is superb, and Greg K's bass thumping adds to the quality of  the music also.  Standout tracks on this album are the three singles,  &quot;Come Out And Play&quot;, &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Get  Away&quot;, as well as &quot;Bad Habit&quot; and &quot;Genocide&quot;.   Even the &quot;departure from the album, &quot;What Happened To You&quot;  is pretty funny and cool, resembling &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job&quot;  from &quot;Americana&quot;.  The lyrics on this album are also very good, a  weak point on most punk albums.  This album appeals to all rock fans,  whether they be fans of punk, metal, ska, or whatever.
6305358613|1.0|There is an excellent review by a reviewer Robert Jefferson, on the next page, I cannot add much to the points he made.  This movie, in the worst  tradition of Holliwood, is similar in approach to &quot;Shakespeare in  Love.&quot;  I always wonder why the producers need totake a historical  personage totally of of the context of their time and create these soap  operas?  Bread and circuses - yes; masterpiece - you're kidding yourself!  The public seems to care little for history...just schmalz, violence, and  sex, and overacting. This movie has plenty of the later. But as a classic  or as history..it is pure Trash
0767819594|4.0|I actually watched this with my teenaged daughter or I would have never  chosen it to watch.  However, I found myself totally lost in the plot and  really loving it.  It was just one of those movies that you didn't have to  really try to analyze, it was just basically about two spoiled rotten  people who would do anything to get what they want.  I really started  liking Sebastian towards the end, when he decided to come clean!  I thought  the acting was great.  Just one of those chic flicks that would be fun to  watch with a couple of good friends.
6300182355|5.0|This is my favourite film of all time. Now I KNOW it's not the most worthy  film ever made, but it is more fun than a bouncy castle in spangled  hotpants. If you prefer some shallow but pretentious movie like Star Wars  to a classic like 'Flash Gordon,' you take life too seriously. Watching  Brian Blessed bellowing &quot;Oh well, who wants to live forever, bwa ha ha  ha ha!!&quot; and that Queen soundtrack kicking in makes me want to go out  and have a spectacular and heroic death right now. Man! Go watch this  movie, and you will understand...
B00004U0OQ|5.0|With &quot;More Human Than Human&quot;, it alone makes this CD a top buy,  but the whole CD is solid White Zombie, pure hardcore Zombie.  One of my  favorite CDs, no doubt.
B00003CXFU|5.0|I was deeply moved by this film, not only because of the wonderful performances by Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, and the numerous other cast,  but because of its unbelievable accuracy. My family and I have personally  been victims of this tragedy and are happy to see the truth revealed. I was  thrilled to learn Julia Roberts would be portraying Erin and feel she was  compassionate and outstanding in her role.  Her language and manner of  dress were quite &quot;colorful&quot; but..that's the real Erin. I hope  that when people view this film, they will learn that this monstrous  company has devestated many, many families. True, the film may have  predictable moments, but they are moments of truth. And there are  undpredictable futures for these victims. It's not over yet....pay  attention to the ending and please.. keep all of the men, women, and  children who are ill today because of the willful wrongdoing of this  company, in your prayers.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Sabotage is the best Black Sabbath album and is the defining work of their  catalogue.  This album truly captures the essence of Sabbath, from Ozzy's  wailing vocals on Hole in the Sky to Iommi's masterwork on Symptom of the  Universe, this album has it all, including some overlooked gems like  Supertzar and Megalomania.  Don't be fooled by others, Paranoid is the most  &quot;radio friendly&quot; Sabbath album but this is their heart and soul.
052594527X|4.0|The Girl with a Pearl Earring was an enjoyable read, but as a lover of sophisticated and surprising endings, I thought the book lacked a great  conclusion.  Up to the resolution, the story was well-written: the  characters were vividly described through the eyes of the protagonist,  Griet, with clear similes and her private thoughts about them.  It was easy  to imagine Catharina (Vermeer's wife) with her capricious, selfish ways,  strong, level-headed Maria Thins (Catharina's mother) and her business  senses, Tanneke ( the other servant)and her fickle-minded mouth,  mean-spirited Cornelia and her hatred towards Griet, and Vermeer's quiet,  lonely, alienated lifestyle.  Almost like an arist herself, Griet leaves no  details and events untold in the story, taking the reader through the first  encounter with the Vermeers to the harsh life of a maid, and the beginning  of a special bond between Griet and Vermeer, always remembering to voice  her opinions and thoughts.  The ending, though, was lacking, predictably  drab, and anticlamatic.  It was too realistic and harsh, when in fiction  you can idealize and romanticize a bit to make.  Still, this is only my  opinion.  For those down-to-earth, practical people who don't mind some  dullness, the Girl with a Pearl Earring will suit you.  <br />Also, this novel  was a lot like I, Juan de Pareja, which is a story about a slave named Juan  working for another big artist, Valezquez.  Both books talk about how a  painting got to be like it is in the present.  Juan, like Griet, narrates  the story and uses a lot of details to create intense images, but he later  on has a happy ending.

Eminem does a  great job relating to the average person by recognizing that drugs/alcohol  and dysfunction happen to people on a daily basis. Keep up the reality  Slim!
B000002LQQ|5.0|This is the most experimental album by Dire Straits. It covers almost  every musical style. It has 12 tracks enough to give us a trip of what  western music is all about. CALLING ELVIS: A straight forward rock n' roll  number dedicated to the king of rock n' roll. It has name of some Elvis's  songs in its lyrics. ON EVERY STREET: A surprizingly mellow number  revolving around a theme, in the last few seconds it bursts off. WONDERFUL.  WHEN IT COMES TO YOU:  It's basically a ballad, but not purely. M.K. is  mixing things up. FADE TO BLACK: This track has a bit of jazz. M.K. guitar  speaks differently. Wonderfully played by the master of guitar. THE BUG: A  very fast rock n' roll. You can listen it when you are feeling happy or  sad. the result? feeling great!!! YOU AND YOUR FRIEND: This track again  great playing (as usual) and also good vocal (emotion in M.K.'s voice). One  of the alltime best track by Dire Straits.    HEAVY FUEL: Rock n' roll  again. IRON HAND: A song with lots of thing that can make one emotional.  Uncomparable guitar work and god, M.K.'s improved vocal. TICKET TO HEAVEN:  A wonderfully written ballad. This is the best ballad by D.S. ever. MY  PARTIES: It is hard to describe this song. It is strangely beautiful song.  It will make anyone dance. A variation from the usual rock stuff. PLANET OF  NEW ORLEANS: A slow rock song.  HOW LONG: Nice and simple country. Simply  great.<br />- This is a must-have album for anyone who likes dire straits and  also for anybody who doubts their talent.
B000002KET|5.0|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath moves more towards a prog rock sound rather than  the standard metal album.  Sure the title track is classic Sabbath, but  tunes like Spiral Architect, Who are you, and Looking for Today point  toward a shift in the bands musical stylings.  By this point Iommi and Ozzy  could not even co-exist so this was really one of last great Sabbath  albums.  Killing yourself to live is such a great song and the lyrics speak  to anyone who hates getting up everyday and slaving away at a mind numbing  job.  This is definitely worth adding to your collection, no bad songs, a  little lighter than most other Sabbath albums but more intriguing.
0140288503|5.0|Mark Bowden's &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is described as &quot;A story of  modern war&quot;.  It tells us about the Battle of the Black Sea in Somalia  on Oct 3-4, 1993.  The Somalis refer to it as Ma-alinti Rangers (The Day of  the Rangers).  All Most Americans remember are the images of dead U.S.  soldiers being dragged through the streets by mobs of Somalis. That is an  image that stays with most Americans.Mark Bowden describes in incredible  detail the operation to capture top players in the Aidid clan, who the UN  felt was responsible for much of the turmoil in Mogadishu.  Minute by  minute narratives take the reader along with  the men of Task Force Ranger,  Delta Force, and the Night Stalker crews.  This book takes any glamour out  of war some people may see.  While wars are sometimes necessary, they  should be a last resort.  War is messy and people die grotesque deaths.   But when war is necessary it comforting to know there are soldiers ready to  go anywhere, anytime into harm's way.This book goes into some of the  fingerpointing you'd expect, but Bowden keeps the story on tract.  This is  a story about the men at ground zero, not what was happening in Washington.   He is diligent in covering the Somali point of view even though there have  been criticisms to the contrary.  There are lessons no doubt, to be learned  from America's involvement in post cold war conflicts such as Somalia.   Books like &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; create healthy discussions that may  not answer all the questions, but at least ask them.  The Battle of the  Black Sea was a tactical success but is perceived as a failure.  Even  though 18 Americans died the mission was a success.  Read this book to  honor those 18.
B0000017CA|5.0|even though acid bath has been disbanded for 3 years now, they still live  on. they released 2 cds(&quot;when the kite string pops&quot; and  &quot;paegan terrorism tactics&quot;)and even though they were never  mainstream-thank god-they have made an impact on the music world like bands  like limp bizkit and kid rock never have and never will. dax's lyrics are  extremely awesome and his vocals are breathtaking. sammy and mike have  excellent guitar skills, audie(r.i.p) was an extremely talented bassist who  left this world too soon, and jimmy was a great drummer. the 1st album is  my personal favorite, but the 2nd is just as good. from songs like  &quot;the bones of baby dolls&quot; and &quot;scream of the butterfly&quot;  to others like &quot;jezebel&quot; and &quot;cassie eats cockroaches&quot;  on &quot;w.t.k.s.p&quot; to songs like &quot;bleed me an ocean&quot; and  &quot;dead girl&quot; on &quot;p.t.t.&quot; acid bath has very diverse  music that anyone can fall in love with. if you like acid bath, you should  check out agents of oblivion(dax and mike's new project)and  goatwhore(sammy's new project... sammy is also now in crowbar). i  definitely recommend both acid bath albums to anyone's cd collection.
B000002KYB|5.0|This album differs from other D.S. albums in its use of keyboard, keyboard  plays a very dominant role in this album starting from &quot;telegraph  road&quot;- This is real good rock track. This track has its lows and  highs, all composed in a very smart way. Wonderful playing by everybody.  &quot;private investigations&quot;- It is basically an instrumental track,  somewhat a little bit dramatic. &quot;industrial disease&quot;- a pretty  fast track with a wonderful keyboard dominated theme.  &quot;love over  gold&quot;- Wonderfully composed. It is the best track of the album. One of  the best by Dire Straits. &quot;It never rains&quot;- This contains great  guitar works by the master guitarist, otherwise it is not anything  exceptional.<br />- This album offers dire straits at their peak. Highly  recommended.
B000002KB8|5.0|People talk about the Beatles bringing Rock to the States, but how about  Sabbath CREATING metal with this ingenious release. There are no songs to  skip on this album all are classic Sabbath, from the heavy riffing of NIB  to the hidden gems Wicked World and the Wizard, Black Sabbath truly was a  groundbreaking album. All of the compositions are long, a trend that  Sabbath would lessen from album to album, but nevertheless this is an  essential album to own.  Black Sabbath is heavy metal.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a great introduction to the psychology of creating  wealth.  If you're a financial genius, this isn't the book for you.  However, if you're the average person who needs a little nudge in the right  direction, this is a great primer!<br />This book reads more like a novel than  a financial manual because I believe the author wanted to make finances  interesting for the masses.  What I got from the book was a concise  understanding of how to make money work for me and the motivation and  confidence I needed to take action.  Since I read this book, I have  enrolled with an online stock broker.  The motivation I've gained more than  pays for the price of the book.<br />Highly recommended for financial novices!
055321263X|5.0|This is a book of letters, journal entries and other personal memories  composed to tell the facinating, alluring story of the Woman in White, on  of Wilkie Collins' best known novels.  I personally very much enjoy his  style of multiple first person perspectives, and the mystery of the story,  from the title, to the description to the characters actions and words  keeps the pages turning and the readers mind entranced.  Basically it  begins with a young art teacher hired to tutor some young girls out in a  country estate, and on his way, he encounters The Woman in White, a  creature of mysterious beauty, who is apparently an escaped mental patient.   But all is not as it seems, and many many twists occur (in plot, and in  narration) before everything becomes clear.  It may sound cliche, and I  suppose to an extent it starts out as being so, but it's so well written,  and with all the twists and surprises, and with such *real* characters,  that one hardly notices.  This is one of my favorite books of all time.
0679777547|5.0|This book is full of thrills, twists, and intrigues. I really thought it  was an interesting and fun book to read. It never made me feel bored at any  part in the story which is a great thing because most books do have their  boring parts. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in  mystery, suspense, rare books, travel, or Alexandre Dumas. Overall, I  really enjoyed it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|You all know about the hit songs, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;,  &quot;Otherside&quot;, and &quot;Californication&quot;. There are other  great songs on this CD, like &quot;Around The World&quot;, &quot;Parallel  Universe&quot;, and &quot;Emit Remmus&quot;. This truly is the Chili  Peppers's best CD.

067158037X|5.0|I bought the cassette version of Angela's Ashes to accompany me on a very  long trip.  The trip passed so quickly that I couldn't believe I was at my  destination!  It was like having a storyteller sitting in the seat next to  me.  His Irish brogue and the way that he sang the songs of his father made  this much more than just a &quot;book on tape&quot;.  I heartily recommend  the audio version.  When you hear it as a story, you do not think of it as  having &quot;bad grammar&quot;.
0385474547|5.0|I dont really feel like sitting here and telling you what this story is  about...you can read the other reviews if that is what you want. I am just  here taking time out of my day to type this for all the prospective readers  out there in order to tell them that this book is really a great novel.  There are not to many books out there with such a wholesome story. Just  read the book, that is all I have to say, you won't be disapointed.
B000002J23|5.0|Yes suffered the loss of Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman, but they managed  to survive. And they did it pretty well! Substitutes Trevor Horn and Geoff  Downes really make a nice performance, and the rest of the band also  achieved a high standard.<br />Beginning with the long &quot;Machine  Messiah&quot; they produced well balanced and rythmic songs that remain as  favorites, like &quot;Does it really happen?&quot; or the frenetic  &quot;Tempus fugit&quot;.<br />Sometimes the keyboards sound old-fashioned for  1980, but they fit well in the overall plan of the album. Maybe you could  also miss some of the great guitar solos by Steve Howe; he rather focused  on developing a new style, but plays as a master.<br />It's not the best Yes  album, but it's got still the &quot;progressive&quot; sound and rythm that  they eventually lost.
0385334206|5.0|This book was really good. The whole story has an underlined meaning. A  really good book if you are feeling down and want to laugh at how silly  other peoples lives can be. One of Vonneguts' best novels!
B000002J1C|5.0|Eventhough this is neither the original nor the definitive Yes lineup,  this record stands as the finest Yes production ever. The music, the words,  the emotion, the FEELING, are just outstanding. This album captivates your  ears since the very first chord, and keeps you astonished even after the  last note is gone away. All the songs have a kind of optimistic mood that  really makes you happy, and &quot;Starship trooper&quot; boosts your  imagination to the stars; it is one of the deepest and more moving songs by  Yes. Steve Howe shows his great skills in &quot;The clap&quot; and  &quot;Yours is no disgrace&quot;, and Jon Anderson sings like an angel.  <br />It's almost 30 years since this record was released and I don't think  anyone could surpass its quality today.
0385333846|5.0|I just wanted to take some time out of my day to tell all the prospective readers out there that Slaughter-House Five is a really good book to read.  It has a serious meaning to it and a certain humor to keep it a fun book.  One of my all-time favorites!
B00003CWL6|3.0|Well, the film doesn't move me as much as I thought it should.  It begins nicely with moments of black comedy that bring the great 1989 film  &quot;War of the Roses&quot; to mind.  But it gets more and more somber and  ponderous towards the end.  The performances are an odd mixture: Annette  Benning, Kevin Spacey, and Mena Suvari are energetic and satirical, while  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper are so low key and deadened it seems  they belong in a different movie.  The various scenes involving voyeurism,  teenage drug use, homophobia, would-be patricide just don't come together  in a cohesive, meaningful whole.  In the end, the film, like the characters  in it, simply gropes around for a resolution.  The film does have brilliant  performances by Benning and Spacey, and some memorable dialogs (&quot;Our  marriage is just a commerical for telling people how normal we are&quot;).   But a tighter and more focused narrative, and more satire and irony  throughout would yield better results.
B0000399WI|5.0|How do I write a review for this phenomenal movie without parroting the  words of some of the other viewers? I don't think any of us can really do  it justice. <br />I too was skeptical about paying money to see a film based  on a Steven King story but this film is a testament to his talent for  creating characters and situation that demand the empathy of the  viewing/reading audience.<br />All I can say is that SHAWSHANK is simply one  of the best American films ever made. It is flawlessly cast, scripted, and  photographed. Even after six viewings this bittersweet story about  injustice, cruelty, and friendship still retains it's meaning.<br />Tim  Robbins and Morgan Freeman deserved Academy Awards for their portrayls of  convicts struggling to survive and maintain a sense of hope and  dignity.<br />The added bonuses on this DVD version is well worth the price.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I went into this film with low expectations, and came out absolutely thrilled.  Of all the movies I've seen this year, Pitch Black has the best  payoff.  Not terribly original, this is a classic &quot;guess who gets  picked off next&quot; horror flick, but rather than an axe-wielding psycho,  we're treated to some incredibly interesting (though purely derivative)  flesh-eaters.  See if you can pick out the &quot;red-shirted security  officers&quot; before people start getting chowed upon.<br />Watch it with the  lights out.  Pitch Black'll make ya . . . jump! jump!
B00004VWAF|2.0|Originally released in 1972, this record has been hailed by some as a  precursor to hip-hop, trance, jungle, and a host of other currently  fashionable musical styles. To these ears, it's a repetitive mess that  never gets off the ground. Davis' trumpet is buried in the mix, and there's  no real melody to speak of either. The best track on the album is \\"Black  Satin,\\" a cut that Bill Laswell remixed with superior results on the  excellent Panthalassa CD in 1998. The sound quality on that album was far  superior, and the song worked much better within the context of that CD.  Here, it just serves as the theme for the last half hour of the disc. On a  historical note, this was the first Miles album to utilize overdubs and  multiple tape machines.
B00003CXGG|5.0|I thought this movie was great... Not good for those people who want to  think their way through a movie but pleanty of good action!
B00004TJKI|5.0|Hollywood's most distinguished actor (let the record speak for itself)  listed this and &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; as his two favorite  films.  That comment really made me take notice, especially after  considering Mr. Smith, Vertigo, Rear Window, Philadelphia Story, etc., etc.  And I think he may be right.  His character is a more mature, moderated  version of George Bailey, but the role is especially challenging because  the parameters of belief and subsequent disillusion must be so much more  contained.  Add to Stewart's performance the others by this perfect cast,  along with a steady directing hand but the often erratic Preminger and Duke  Ellington's best movie score, and the result is the ultimate courtroom  drama--not to mention a great movie.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This c/d has to be one of the best i have ever heard. it's 10 times better than '...baby one more time'. The best song on the c/d has to be ' Where Are You Now' This c/d captures so many human moods, and captures them  beutifully. buy this now!
0380788624|4.0|It's a somewhat sad comment on litarary reviewers that Neal Stephenson had to move a bit out of the SF field with this novel to get taken seriously by  reviewers. Nevertheless, this novel feels like a more mature work in  several aspects: It's the first novel by Stephenson that has a halfway  decently written ending, the characters are reasonably aware and afraid of  their mortality, and the writing in some scenes borders on the subtle (e.g.  when Turing comes on to the elder Waterhouse).<br />The plot, some sort of  combination of Pynchon's &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;, Buchheim's  &quot;Das Boot&quot;, and a stack of WIRED magazines, starts off as a  somewhat slow read but becomes more and more compelling. <br />The core idea  which the book explores is the interaction of the world of information and  the world of physical interaction -- bitspace vs. meatspace, and Stephenson  resists the temptation to facilely declare (as many a WIRED author would)  that meatspace &quot;has become irrelevant&quot;, nor (as people like  Clifford Stoll would) that bitspace &quot;is not real&quot;. Rather, he  shows that interactions go both ways: Decrypted bits *do* sink ships; a few  corrupt cops  *can* seriously cramp the style of a hacker cruising  cyberspace.
B000007SPT|5.0|This is the most beautiful song that I never heard : &quot;SONG TO THE  SIREN&quot;. You must have this CD just for this song. THAT'S HEAVEN IN THE  VOICE. Lyz Fraser thanks.
6305165912|5.0|This movie, is one the funniest, and most clever movies, that I have ever  seen.  The Coen brothers have done it again.  I really could live my life  by this movie.  It probably wouldn't be a great life, but I could do it.   No movie beats this one.
6302878527|3.0|Hepburn and Finney act well, and their chemistry is obvious. Though the film's portrayal of romantic love is a bit shallow and completely  sex-driven (mirroring the social changes of its time), the way in which the  plot's timeline is scrambled is clever and provocative. Mancini's score is  gorgeous and elicits the romantic idealism and nostalgia which colors the  entire film.
0790742314|5.0|Gremlins was the movie to see back when it came out, at the time I was only four but somehow I convinced my mom to take me to see it.  I had  nightmares for weeks.  But it was worth it.  The story about a unique  Christmas gift with only a few rules to follow is one of my favorites, and  who doesn't love the cute, funny antics of that innocent little Mogwi,  Gizmo?<br />The gremlins were hilarious in their mischievous invasion of  town.  And their deaths were just plain gross.  But that was half the fun.  The best part, however, was Gizmo, he made the movie.  Parents might want  to watch this one first before letting really small children sit down in  front of the tube, it might just be a little too intense for the wee ones.  Anyone over 7 should be able to handle it though, but be prepared to check  under the bed, in the closet, and in every conceivable crevice before your  child will let you turn out the lights after watching this.  In my opinion  this is a kiddie horror movie, that's just as fun to watch now as it was  back in 1984.  A great addition to any video collection and one that is  sure to have repeated viewings.  But remember to follow the rules...
0060926317|4.0|A wonderful journey in the Australian outback that pictures the journey  that every man should do within himself. The search for the Holy and the  respect for Nature.

The  Aboriginees may be &quot;primitive&quot; but they have a lot to teach to  everyone.
0783219172|5.0|The Frighteners is a must see movie, especially if you are partial to  Horror.  Michael J. Fox plays Frank Bannister, a psychic investigator in  cahoots with the very ghosts he is paid to exorcise!  But when one of his  clients dies a most mysterious death all suspicion falls on him. And then  more people start to die. A dark shrouded figure, carrying a scythe is to  blame, something from beyond the grave.  With the aid of several spectral  friends (watch out for John Astin as the Judge!) and a little human  detective work all his own Frank comes across a most dark and disturbing  episode in his town's history. And more than once crosses pathes with the  true culprit, putting himself at the scene of the crime.<br />Relying more  on comedy than anything else the scares are few and far between, but when  the come they pack a wallop!  The special effects (especially those  involving the Reaper) are awesome, the story is unique and entertaining.  And the acting is above and beyond what is expected in a Horror movie.  The  Frighteners is one hell of a ride, from beginning to end.  A must have for  any Horror fan, especially if you fear the Reaper.
6305372411|5.0|This series is a fitting tribute to those who went miles and miles before us.  It is also a reminder that we have miles and miles to go.  All I can  say is well done, Tom Hanks and cast--for their fine work, they all should  have won Emmys!
6305426651|5.0|Never in my life have I seen a movie that has so deeply effected me.  It  took me several hours to even speak- literally even speak- after seeing it  with friends of mine who bawled uncontrollably throught 90% of this epic.  It was days before I could even tell people that I saw it.<br />I have seen  CITIZEN KANE; I have seen CASABLANCA; I have seen E.T.; ALL ABOUT EVE; THE  GODFATHER; APOCAPSYE NOW; Olivier's OTHELLO; IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE; and so  on, and so on... this is the greatest movie I have ever seen; bar none.  I  never knew the love a father has for his wife and son could be portrayed so  incredibly, in the context of prevailing against the ultimate evil and  madness.  It's European way of refusing to tell you how to feel, but  allowing you to witness the uncontrollable flood of your own emotions as  you bare witness to that which is most frightening and most beautiful in  being human just has to be seen to be understood- there are no superlatives  I can think of that could do it justice.<br />This movie has changed me,  and changed the way I see the entire art form of cinema- its value to  society, and the possibility of its capacity to reveal truth.<br />I have  not seen the dubbed version, and I would suggest to any who have not seen  this in the theatres to find the version with English subtitles.  Dubbbed  films, in sacrificing so much in the translation, tend to muffle the soul  of the actors' perfomance; to big a price to pay, I believe, for the  convenience of not having to look down and read while looking up and  experiencing this in its purest, most complete sense.<br />As far as I am  concerned, this is the greatest movie ever made.
B00000IAU3|5.0|After hearing clips of Here With Me as the theme song for the TV show  Roswell, I knew I had to have this song. Then upon hearing the entire  album, I was lost. Dido's blends of classical, acoustic and modern  electronic are addictive. The lyric's are hauntingly romantic. Easily a CD  that will be listed as a classic. With this much talent on a first CD, I  anxiously await the next.

B000002U8G|5.0|I do understand that if your IQ is below average, you will more than  likely not enjoy this incredible music. Today's music, for the most part,  is so &quot;on the surface&quot; that it becomes boring within minutes. Not  so with this album. Especially Echoes. And especially the Live version of  Echoes! If you have never heard the live version, get Live at Pompeii.  There is a certain quality and sound which is not present in the studio  version. A certain depth and ambience which is more raw, more real, and  more ambient. Dave's guitar solo is much different, and it feels great!  Nick's drums far more powerful and apparent, Rick's piano far more  penetrating, and Roger's bass much deeper. This song rocks! But I'm not  supposed to be reviewing a video, but an incredible  album called Meddle.  Get it!!!
079284632X|5.0|An infamous classic and extremely shocking piece of cinema - Wes Craven's directorial debut is both mean and upsetting, but with almost solid  performances throughout, deserves 82 minutes of any horror/thriller fan's  time. <br />David Hess gives an all-too real performance as the evil Krug,  leader of a group of convicts, who escaped from Jail - even as the film  starts and introduces the audience to this group of four, we learn that  Krug was locked up for the rape and murder of two nuns and a priest! As the  plot develops, they kidnap two girls under false pretenses, rape them and  ultimately torture and murder them. They then go to the nearest house (the  one of the title) and unwittingly stay with the parents of one of the  girls. The parents work out what has happened and all hell breaks loose -  the ending is quite a treat and almost more violent than what the gang do  to the two girls, though slightly justified.<br />The film was made with a  small budget in 1972, which does sometimes reveal itself, but mostly it's a  real 'tour-de-force', a shockingly brilliant exercise into extreme tension.  The MGM re-release is slightly cut to trim some of the more excessive  gore/violence, but this makes the film in some ways more effective as then  more is left to the imagination.<br />Watch this film - hate or love it, you  can't help but atleast admire such a bold effort from a very young Wes  Craven.
B0000025ZK|1.0|It is quite evident that David Gilmour will never, has never, and will  never compare to ROGER WATERS(whom I might add wrote a large majority of  the songs David Gilmour still plays with the so called Pink Floyd.  This cd  is plop.  All you have to do is listen to &quot;Blue Light&quot; or are  have the unfortunate bad luck of seeing the video.  In most cases he does  not even write his own lyrics.  So please, listen to the real Pink Floyd  and don't waste your money.
0679721037|5.0|This book is NOT fiction - unfortunately the events and the people in this  book are very real. &quot;Hiroshima&quot; follows the lives of six  survivors of the atomic bomb from the hours preceeding the explosion on  August 6, 1945, to the decades afterwards. The survivors detailed in this  book include a housewife, a German priest, two doctors, a young working  woman, and a reverend. The details were superb, and I learned a lot of  facts of which I was previously unaware. The story tells of the physical  intensity of the bomb, the horrible, crippling symptoms experienced by the  victims both at the time of the bomb and afterwards, and of the treatment  experienced by the victims of the bomb.  One of the things that most  shocked me was the treatment of the &quot;hibakusha&quot; by their own  country based on the  Japanese government's reluctance to take  responsibility for these victims.  Everyone should read this book and  educate themselves about this historical event (especially those of us who  were not alive during that time period).  It is sobering and frightening to  think that it could certainly happen again anywhere in the world due to  increased nuclear capabilites by many countries on this planet.
B000009HF2|5.0|I just finished  watching ''Behind The Music'' on VH 1 about Peter  Frampton and I thought it was one of the best ever. It brought back so many  great memories from this  incredible album/cd. Along with Fleetwood Mac's  ''Rumours'', The Eagles ''Hotel California,'' Boston's first and Bob  Seger's ''Night Moves,''this was 70's rock at it's finest. It's a real  shame he could'nt continue with great follow- ups although I thought ''I'm  In You'' was underrated. For all of you ''babyboomers,''go out and buy this  cd and rediscover again what a great cd this is!
B00000J7JO|4.0|I just bought their CD and it was pretty good. my favorite are  &quot;Around the World&quot; and &quot;Easily.&quot; I like most of it in  exception of some songs that weren't as good as other. They have a  different sound on most every song which i'm pleased about.

0784010501|2.0|Alek Keshishian's vision was indeed a noble one. This could have easily  become a true &quot;rockumentary&quot;, if Madonna had not become aware of  the camera and tried to be cutesy and show off. The beginning of the film  is wonderful...telling Alek to &quot;get out&quot; of her business  conversations. Later in the film, the &quot;candid&quot; moments appeared  very contrived. The bed scene with the dancers and singers? C'mon! Are we  to believe this is candid? It's probably a good movie for the hardcore  fans, but the rest of us are left with an empty and cheated feeling.
B00004W5UA|5.0|fight club. what can i say? a brilliant, hyperadrenal shotgun blast into the face of dead end, ant farm, postmodern american pseudo-culure that  never forgets to satirize when it proselitizes. this film puts the black  into black comedy with some of the most mean spirited and hilarious comic  touches of all time. seamlessly directed and flawlessly acted, fight club  is a movie everyone should see. and this includes women. most of the women  i know who've seen it didn't care for it, and i don't feel particularly  surprised by this, since the film is overbearingly testosterone edged. it  most certainly is told from the perspective of the immasculated male, and  is clearly targeted towards same. however, at the same time the film deftly  pokes fun at just that kind of mentality, sometimes with subtlety,  sometimes, quite frankly, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer  (including an undeniable and roaringly funny homoerotic subtext that made  me laugh so hard i very nearly vomited). many will tell you that, contrary  to what you may have heard or gleaned about this movie, it does not glorify  violence. well, actually, this is a half-truth. the film neither glorifies  nor condemns violence but simply approaches it with an intelligence and a  simpathetically honest eye toward the impulse to destroy, and be destroyed,  that you almost never, ever see in movies anywhere; rather than getting its  rocks off with it or, conversely, succumbing to the pressures to indulge in  a sappy, saccharine, PSA mentality that tries only to deny the violent  impulses within us all. i am jack's renewed faith in cinema.
6303589170|3.0|In a joint venture by the governments of the world, a space probe is launched into the farthest reaches of the Galaxy bearing a message from the  United Nations, as well as \\"Greetings\\" in fifty-four languages; it's  purpose is to attempt to contact any extraterrestrial life and proffer an  invitation to visit us here on Earth.  In \\"Starman,\\" directed by John  Carpenter, Jeff Bridges stars as the alien who responds, only to be met  with a less than cordial greeting once he arrives.  Encountering hosts with  a militaristic, if-you-can't-identify-it-shoot-it-down attitude, Starman is  forced to take refuge and elude the very ones he has traveled so far to  see.  The burning question of course is, why?  And, unfortunately, nobody  seems to know.  For his striking portrayal of Starman, Bridges  deservedly received a Best Actor nomination from the Academy, and it proves  to be the highlight of the film.  From the outset, even as he is  transformed into the vessel he must occupy during his stay with us ( a  terrific sequence), his presence on the screen is captivating.  He truly  creates a unique character, distinct in form and substance, from the  physical gestures that define him, to the subtle emotional depth he so  aptly demonstrates and uses so well to convey to us who this being really  is.  It is through him that we are drawn in to this story of the travails  with which he is beset during his sojourn upon our world, and with him we  can only try to understand the motivation of powerful men who seem to live  their lives in fear of the unknown or diverse.  As Jenny Hayden, the  young woman who through circumstances beyond her control becomes involved  with Starman, Karen Allen adds just the right touch of sympathy to  underscore the emotional situation in which Jenny finds herself ensconced.   And there's just enough chemistry between her and Bridges to make this  special relationship between their characters work effectively.   Ultimately, how they relate to one another, and the tenderness with which  they pursue their objective, becomes the real thrust and focal point of the  story.  Carpenter, in fact, would have been well advised to have stayed  more within the parameters of that relationship and explored the workings  thereof, rather than divesting the story into other, less fruitful areas  and surrounding the main characters with a plethora of stringent  stereotypes.    While an entertaining film, \\"Starman\\" is surprisingly  lacking in originality and imagination, both in story and direction; not to  say this isn't a worthwhile endeavor, because it is, and it's definitely  worth seeing.  But it just seems that Carpenter could have mined the  emotional depths a little more, developed the connection between Starman  and Jenny more fully.  Had he taken that path, this could have been a truly  exceptional movie.  As it is, it's a good film, better than the average  sci-fi offering (especially for it's time, 1984), but given that Bridges  brought so much to this with his creation of such a memorable character,  the movie as a whole could have been so much more.  The supporting cast  includes Charles Martin Smith (Mark), Richard Jaeckel (Fox), Robert Phalen  (Major Bell), Dirk Blocker (Cop #1) and M.C. Gainey (Cop #2).  Although it  is not what you would call a \\"great\\" or \\"classic\\" movie, \\"Starman\\" does  succeed in making us take pause to reconsider some of our possibly  preconceived notions of the way things are or should be; in the end, it's a  call for understanding and love between all people everywhere, and a  proposition put forth for universal peace.  And with a theme like that,  combined with the terrific performance by Bridges, you could do a lot worse  for an evenings entertainment.
B00003W8NM|5.0|One of the most often repeated critiques made about director David Fincher's FIGHT CLUB is that the movie presents the apology of the violence  and, among other ideas, defends the theory that today general aggressivity  can only be controlled by letting people expressing verbally and physically  this violence. In a way, we could become a new generation of Romans  watching without guilt hyper-brutal movies in the same way than the ancient  Romans were applauding the gladiators. Well, I admit that maybe some  limited persons can feel an intense pleasure while watching the fights of  FIGHT CLUB and what ? If only these scenes could prevent real incidents by  offering to some of us the possibility to let our adrenaline flow freely,  why not !<br />But FIGHT CLUB deserves a lot more than sterile discussions  about this peculiar aspect of the movie. Firstly, director David FINCHER,  along with his art director, has created a unique artistic vision of Edward  Norton's sick point of view. From the beginning of the movie, the story is  told from Norton's point of view which slowly deforms the reality and  presents to the audience a world filled with the obsessions of the  insomniac employee. Fincher, with a few arty effects and very good  monologs, is able to create very quickly uneasiness and tension.<br />With the  apparition of Brad Pitt, the movie, little by little, gives up his critical  and social dimension and becomes the repertoire of our most hidden fears or  desires. When the Fight Club is replaced by the Mayhem Project, you are  thrown into the world that director Don Siegel had so well described in  INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, a world where paranoia is the only  rule.<br />A DVD for your library. If you dare.
B00000JCOV|2.0|Okay, since people talked about this album sooooo much, i decided to get  it.  Well, I will say that they have talent and originality, but I still  didn't like it.  Too much swearing and too much screaming.  And from what  I've read, it's all an act.  The evil they portray themselves as is nothing  but coverups, like lets say, the masks?  If you like fast-paced hard music  or noise or whatever, than I recomend it.  But if you like music with more  of a melody to it, look somewhere else.  I've got to admit, some of the  sounds they used were pretty cool.
6303187064|5.0|this is one of the best movies in the world to me and it has a great  story. I like it because it has something for everybody action, love story,  and the coolest special effects i have ever seen, this movie should be seen  by everyone and I know for a fact that you will enjoy it.
B00000IQBM|5.0|hey there, this movies one of the greatest movies i've ever seen, the  shooting, the acting, the music, the story and the production everythings  just great. u know its the kinda movie that leaves back a kind of a trace  in ur mind. but the only thing i hate about it is that now i'm too chicken  to read the book!!!
B00000JGOH|5.0|This movie was great, and I am glad that it got the Oscar for Best Picture! It was a wonderful romance story and I think everyone should see it. It is about Shakespeare, and he has a bad case of writer's block until this beautiful girl comes into his life! Geoffrey Rush, Gweyneth Paltrow, and almost everyone else give great performances! Rent it!
B00000J7JO|5.0|the albums smashin, i couldn't stop listening to scar tissue and the  lyrics in californication were excellent, road trippin was tracing bet some  of the songs r meaningless 4 example (getontop) what kinda music is that???  or right on time???!!!! but anyway its a good album. thanx if ur listening.
6302378648|4.0|I bought this movie the other day at Suncoast because I am a big fan of  Robert De Niro and I had never seen it. I watched it later that night, and  I found it to be very good, but also very, very disturbing. It is about  this convict that has just been released from prison after 15 years, and he  decides to take revenge on his lawyer that put him there. He starts  stalking the lawyer (played by Nick Nolte) and his teenage daugter and  wife. This version of the movie is quite different from the original in  many ways. In the original, the family were so happy together. They were  like the friggin' Brady Bunch. In Martin Scorsese's new version, they are  very close to being torn apart. Sam (the lawyer) is fooling around with  another woman, and his wife suspects something is going on. Dannielle  (their daughter) is well aware that her parents are having problems and  often locks herself in her room, cuts up the television and calls a friend  to get away from her parents constant fighting. The family is in trouble  throughout the whole movie. Also, in the original, Max Cady's attacks are  not shown, just implied. In this version, however, we witness each one of  them in graphic, horrifying detail. There are alot of changes, but I guess  the director felt that it made the story more realistic. THIS IS NOT A  MOVIE FOR CHILDREN OR PRE-TEENS AT ALL! Overall, it was a good movie, but  it is definitly not for everyone, especially the squemish.
B000002U82|5.0|i've never seenanyone like them, gilmore and waters play the guitar like  spelling they're names, one good things about them is that they have good  imagination. and they're lyrics r sooooo good, i tell u, they're musicians.
6305212112|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a small child over and over again. I  remember how I always wanted to visit the small town of Whistle Stop, and  how I had watched the movie so many times that I felt like I actually knew  every single one of the characters. I remember the special feeling I always  got while watching this movie, and I remember the message of friendship  that this movie shared with me, and many other people who have had the  privalege to see this wonderful film! I highly recommend this movie to  anyone who is looking for very special &quot;feel good&quot; film...a film  that they could love forever!
B000002KE2|5.0|I've liked a song here and there of Black Sabbath through the years, but  this one takes the cake. This one isn't hard and fast (although &quot;Snow  Blind&quot; kind of rocks), but it is nothing if not classic metal! The  music is awesome, the vocals are excellent and the music just flows!<br />I  liked the whole Disc. This to me, is Black Sabbath's greatest hits!
6305212112|5.0|In 1991, a film was released that introduced the world to some of the most beloved characters to ever grace the silver screen. That film was Fried Green Tomatoes, which was based on Fannie Flagg's novel, published in 1987. The film is now on DVD.    The film opens a ghost train rolls through the sleepy town of Whistle Stop, Alabama. The wind blows as the train whistles off into the distance. Evelyn Couch sits in a car next to the railroad track waiting on her husband Ed, as he talks away on a pay phone. She has just witnessed this paranormal event, and is awestruck. After a minute, her husband climbs back in the car. \\"Did you hear that,\\" she asks him. \\"Hear what?,\\" he replies. \\"A train,\\" Evelyn whispers.    They make their way to a nursing home, where Ed's aunt resides. When they arrive, the elderly woman violently objects to Evelyn's presence, and so Evelyn sits in the lobby to enjoy a candy bar. This is where Evelyn meets Ninny Threadgoode, and kind elderly woman, all too eager to sit down and chat. The two begin making small talk, until Ninny mentions the Whistle Stop Café. This peaks Evelyn's interest, as the ghost train is still fresh on her memory. Ninny asks Evelyn to settle in. She'll tell her all about it.     Ninny tells Evelyn of Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison, two fundamentally diverse women who became best friends during the Depression. When we first meet Idgie Threadgoode, she is a full-fledged tomboy, wily and rough around the edges. After the death of her brother, Buddy, Idgie becomes distant from her family. Her mother begins to worry, and summons Ruth, Buddy's ex-girlfriend, to counsel Idgie. At first, Idgie and Ruth clash, but as time goes by, the two women become an inseparable force. They see one another through every trial, and eventually open the Whistle Stop Café, which brings the small town to life. Ninny's story inspires Evelyn to change her life, and the two women form a strong bond, as Evelyn continues to visit Ninny day after day,longing to hear more about these wonderful characters. This film has everything: nostalgia, good food, good people, and good music - even a murder mystery.     I saw this film in theatres when I was very young, and I have never forgotten it. I have seen a lot of films in my lifetime, but this one has definitely become a part of me. I love everything about it. Out of all of the characters in literary and cinematic history, Idgie and Ruth, Ninny and Evelyn, Sipsy and Big George are some of my absolute favorites. I feel like I know them. When a film can draw you in, when it allows you to become a part of the world that it creates, that is very unique - and rare, especially today. I simply cannot remember the last time that a mainstream drama affected me so deeply.     Jon Avnet's direction is beyond superb. He captures the look and feel of the novel, and puts it right there in front of you. The performances are extraordinary. Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary-Louise Parker, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Cisely Tyson - as well as the rest of the cast - collaborate selflessly with magnificent results.     Thomas Newman's score for the film is unlike any other. This score evokes so much emotion, from joy, to fear, to bittersweet sadness. One of his best.     This film is one that will stay with me for as long as I live. I cannot imagine my life as a film buff without it. A true classic.     PG-13 for language, adult themes, and scenes of spousal abuse. 137 minutes.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This one has some of the best songs Fleetwood Mac ever did. I've bought a  few &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums where the only song I recognized was  the only one worth listening to. Not the case with this one! Every song on  here is excellent! <br />The only other song I really wish they had put on  here was &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, but I can't complain... I left  this CD in my player for a month solid after I got it!
0783223161|5.0|I first saw this movie last summer at a friends house, and I immediatly  went out and bought the movie! It is one of the best movies that I have  ever seen. <br />It is about a woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is  on the run with some stolen money. She drives off, leaving her job and her  home. She ends up at the Bates Motel, which is ran by a creepy manager  named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman notices that she is wet and  cold since it was raining outside, and offers to make her a sandwich and  get her something warm to drink. He goes into his house to get the food,  and Marion overhears Norman yelling at someone, who turns out to be his  mother. Marion starts to worry, and apologizes to Norman that she got him  into trouble. He tells Marion that his mother is not quite herself. Marion  eats her food, and talks to Norman, and then she goes into her cabin to  take a shower. Someone comes into the shower and stabs her to death. Norman  suspects that it was his mother, and cleans up the mess, and drives  Marion's car into a lake. Anyways, a detective and Marion's sister and  boyfriend end up investigating the scene....and thats all that I am saying!  Rent this movie! It is great, and I highly recommend it.
B0000025D0|5.0|I just realized that it's very hard to write a fair and levelheaded review  of something that has had such a large impact on my personal life. This  album, together with Nebraska, is Springsteen at his absolute best. And it  feels like it has been a close friend for quite a long time now.<br />Dark.  Angry. Powerful. Deep meanings and implications about love, family and  everything in between. But at the same  time -- and this is what has always  drawn me to his  music -- accessible, listenable and extremely enjoyable.  <br />Songs as &quot;Badlands&quot;, &quot;The Promised Land&quot; and  &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; are among his best ever and they  deal with important and serious issues. Feelings of abandonment. Of  loneliness. Of not feeling like you're a part of society. But unlike the  Nebraska album, there's also very much hope buried inside the stories of  Darkness on the edge of town. The characters have not given up although  their life is difficult and they are searching for, I guess they are just  searching for, something.<br />The short story is: this record rocks,  lyrically and musically.
B00003CXGG|5.0|When I heard that Jet Li was going to be a lead in an action movie  produced by Joel Silver, I was very excited.  Before I give a review, I'm  not biased to Jet Li because our crew interviewed him and promoted his  movie online.  I'm not biased to liking this movie because I have been a  big fan of his work.  I loved this movie because it features wonderful  action scenes, an interesting focus on using the African Americans and  Asians working together and it features a lot of cool people in the movie.<br />The storyline is pretty cool and purists of Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Chow  Yun Fat are going to be angry at the US movies because such movies don't do  justice to what talent they have demonstrated on the HK movies they have  been in and I truly understand that.<br />Another thing is people might feel  the MATRIX style fighting hurts this movie.  I don't think so.  Personally,  some fight scenes are a exaggerated and I agree with that but a lot of the  other fight scenes are very awesome such as the scenes in the stairs, the  football scene, the fire hose scene...awesome!<br />Others maybe upset that  the interracial relationship was not strong enough and were upset there was  no kiss scene between Alliyah and Jet.  We asked Jet about that and he said  that in the end (without spoiling the movie for you), after a bad situation  happens to a family member, should you be kissing a girl you just met.  So,  Jet had a good reason for that. [Note: You can our interview with Jet Li at  AsianConnections.com]<br />So, however you felt about the movie, to each their  own.  I really enjoyed it!  In fact, at the theater in San Jose/Santa  Clara, it was packed and people gave it a standing ovation.  I'm happy to  see Jet's first debut in a lead role for an English movie.<br />What didn't I  like about the film?  I didn't dig the use of the X-RAY scenes in the  violent parts.  That was the major thing I didn't like but everything else,  I enjoyed.<br />Now, the DVD.  The colors were very beautiful for this movie.  I don't recall any major artifacting.  The audio for the film is very good  as well but what makes this DVD shine is the special features.  Not only do  you get the regular trailer, the international trailer but you get two  Alliyah music videos, the making of the music video &quot;Try Again&quot;,  you get many short documentaries, the HBO featurette and the  behind-the-scenes vignette.  The insights to how the film was filmed is so  interesting, if you are a Jet Li or Alliyah fan, the extras are also a  major reason to buy this DVD.  Really interesting information from each  actor and from those who worked behind-the-scenes.  So, the DVD will  definitely keep you busy for awhile.<br />So, you can't go wrong with this  DVD.

068484267X|5.0|This portrayal of Frank McCourt's childhood/early adolescence is in a  class by itself.  The writing style from a child's perspective is  tremendously honesty giving it a unique freshness and dignity.  His  childhood experience was one of extreme poverty which is something most of  us cannot relate to but it reminds us that regardless of socioeconomic  status, we all can relate to the basic things in life - relationships with  siblings, parental embarrassments, learning life's lessons through  whispered conversations with friends etc.  This book has something to offer  any intelligent reader.  I absolutley loved it!!  READ IT.  If you were  once a confused child, you will relate.
6305922756|5.0|A brilliant comedy by the master of subtle and accurate comedy.  If you like VH-1's Behind the Music, this is the documentary, er, should I say  Rockumentary that started it all.  You'll love it!
6304765231|4.0|The Crow is one of my favorite movies and not because it is the greatest  movie I have ever seen (it isn't) but because it holds a very special place  in my heart.  The good guy gets revenge and is reunited with his love and  the wrong things are set right... what more could you ask for?  I am  writing this review to let those who wish to buy this DVD know that the  sound is excellent and the picture is outstanding.  When deciding to  purchase this item I read a review which said that on the DVD the dark  shadows of the film were grays instead of blacks and the sound wasn't of  the highest quality - well, both those things are false.  So if you have  read the same review, don't fret because the shadows are still black, the  picture is clear, and the sound is exceptional.
0440180295|5.0|When I finished the book on the Lexington Avenue Subway line while commuting home from work I nearly cried.  This ranks as one of the best  books I ever read (100 Years of Solitude, Razor's Edge, Power &amp; Glory).   Vonnegut smacks the reader upside the head with the horrors of war while  you're laughing and crying with Billy Pilgrim, one of the saddest  characters in 20th Century literature.
B000002KIE|5.0|I've been listing to rock and its variations since 1962.  I was born in  NYC and prefer rock from the U.K. to most anything from the USA.  Forget  the history, forget the reasons, forget the times, forget the genre; this  is singularly the greatest rock album ever produced.  This album is the  album The (early) Who, the (early) Stones, the Doors, and any other true  &quot;punk&quot; bands wished they'd put out.  Raw, meaningful, heartfelt,  brass tacks, no frills, rock.  The collection of songs moves you to  manifest your most base animal desires and isn't that what true rock was  meant to do? Anarchy is an attitude more than a political persuasion and  this album drips with attitude. Don't forget:  anger is an energy.  It  helps if you understand their perspective but only if you want to go  between the lines.  Otherwise, all you really have to do is close the  windows, turn it up, and thank your God you were smart enough to buy it.
1570428654|5.0|I wish that I had purchased the tapes because part of the enjoyment of  David Sedaris's stories is hearing him tell them.  I still enjoyed reading  the book, but found myself trying to hear his voice reading it to me as he  does on NPR.  I was amused by every story and often laughed out loud.
B00002E233|4.0|I saw this movie when it came out in the theater and was really surprised  at how good it was.  This move kept me at the edge of my seat throughout.   I watched this movie again on DVD, and was extremely delightly with the  action.  I recommend you to buy this movie and watch the move with the  commentary of the director and Samuel L. Jackson, his commentary is very  funny....Enjoy.
B00004XMVH|4.0|This movie, which features some nifty, surprising and explosive war-time effects involving WWII submarines, has an old-fashioned heart and style;  it's a throwback to the testosterone, military-themed movies that sprang up  during/after WWII.  While Matthew M. is not especially effective with his  leading role, the rest of the cast is superb, and the thrills are gigantic,  the suspense truly terrifying and deafening.  This movie should have made a  much bigger splash, if you will, during its recent theatrical release -- it  is heads and tails better thanmost action thrillers, and creates a tension  and mood with a tight, engrossing story.
0767802659|3.0|Starship Troopers was known for one thing, and that was the gore.  However the main meaning of the movie was lost due to that.  This movie is a social  commentary/satire of war propoganda that was so evident during WWII on both  sides.  <br />While Verhoeven used this to much better effect in Robocop (the  media campaign where the public is swayed to accept the brutal methods of  law enforcement by Robocop in a series of PR campaigns).  However, it does  have some impact here, but it is used too straightfowardly (there is little  deception from the media) to be truly effective.<br />The story revolves  around a group of preppy rich kids from Buenos Aires (yeah right) and the  journey from teenagedom to responsible citizens.  That part of the movie is  fairly derivative and the characters are all cardboard cutout, Melrose  Place types.<br />However the special effects are out of this world.  From the  Armada fleet scenes to the spider like creatures, the EFX team deserve  kudos for their fantastic efforts.  The set designs and cinematography is  also top notch.  Just don't expect a story to go with the eye candy  though.<br />The DVD is exceptionally clean and thesound is excellent.  There  are many features that make this worth buying, from the Verhoeven voice  over, the deleted scenes and the scene tests between Casper Van Dien and  Denise Richards.  For extra's, the DVD proves it's own worth. <br />If  Verhoeven could have taken more control of the story writing and character  development, rather than relying on special features to keep the audience  interested, this could have been his Robocop for the 90's.  Instead this  movie gets a....Rating: C.
B00000DC7L|5.0|Just to prove that there is life after Queen, Brian May has come up with  an absolutely wonderful album. The full range of his undoubted talent is  here for all the world to see, from the traditional Queen-esque rockers  such as Business and China Belle to the hauntingly beautiful Another World  and Why Don't We Try Again. Brian has emerged from Freddie Mercury's huge  shadow to become a solo artist in his own right. His delicate and emotional  vocal style is perfectly complimented by his stunning guitar work - the man  is a musical genius, do yourself a favour and go out and buy this album  ..... your ears will love you for the rest of your life.
B00000IQMT|4.0|The music in StarWars has always been an experience to listen to.  It was always fitting to the scene and really makes to serve up an epic.  Some of  the music is in a tone of dispair (such as Qui-Gon's Noble End) or joyous  celebration (Augies Great Municipal Band)and even an odd sounding  interlude.  The music ingenious of Williams has never ceased to amaze me,  especially with the last track of the CD; horns and drums beating with a  child chorus in the background.  It is this type of music that keeps me  interested in his work and he always finds new ways in which to keep his  fresh and new.  But alas, there is a downfall to this soundtrack, some of  the tracks are just too subtle and slow and really don't keep me  interested, but that is too little to really make it bad, but I did mark  down a star for it.  If you like Starwars or just good music, get this  Soundtrack today.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|These moves tell the tale about a young boy named Luke Skywalker which his life takes a dramatic turn when two robots are bought by his uncle. Little  does Luke knew about the adventures he was about to have with his  companions C3PO and R2D2. Pirates, smugglers, aliens from different parts  from the galaxy along with fantastic special effetcs fill out one of the  most dramatic movies in history.
6305750750|5.0|The Starwars series have always been a great series in the eyes of many kids and adults alike.  It has suffered from some harsh critisism from  people who don't like it, but the Starwars series has more staying power  than most things in the world.  Episode 1 was a treat in the graphics  department, but also a change in the mood you get when you see a Starwars  film.  As you should know, the first three to come out (New Hope, Empire,  and Jedi)were the last in the series; Episode 1 is the first in the  timeline of Starwars.  To many people, this could have proved to be a  letdown, as it is more plot intensive, rather than starfighting and  Imperial blasting fun.  However, it does answer many questions pertaining  to the series and it shows just how sweet Anakin Skywalker (AKA Darth  Vader) really was before he turned to the dark side.  It also answers many  questions about the Jedi, Imperials, and plot surrounding the first three.    The excellent acting and fight scenes were a major plus in the film, not  to mention the amazing visuals in the movie.  Most think Starwars Episode 1  was just a test to see what we could do, but that is just not true.  A  Starwars film has ALWAYS stived to be ahead of its time, no reason why this  shouldn't do the same.  With acting and story to the tops, there is no  reason why you should not buy this movie today. As with the package, you  get a nice little strip of the film negative and you get a nice book  featuring some cool concept art and cool designs/layouts of many places.   Also, you have a cool box with a great art picture of Theed in the  background, so it is a fringe benefit you could say.  The box series is  definatly suggested for Starwars fans; other people who just want to see  the movie, stick with just the movie.
B000002JSZ|3.0|This CD is very good. It opens with the thundering &quot;Rising  Power&quot;, a true AC/DC crafted tune. It has &quot;Guns for Hire&quot;  and &quot;Bedlam in Belgium&quot;, and, believe me, the lyrics are not so  ridiculous as others albuns by them !!! Unfortunately, Phil Rudd left the  boat soon after the recording. After this very good release, a true AC/DC  album, nothing was the same.. After &quot;Flick&quot;, came their worst  effort ever, &quot;Fly on The Wall&quot;.
6303481272|5.0|this is just amazing with a good story line and brutal yet beautiful  fighting scenes that make you say ouch.i believe this is the first in a 3  part series but i have never seen the other 2,but if they are anywhere near  as good as this then i would be in shock because this is a masterpiece in  animation and a landmark story-later
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is a perfect movie. Everything about it is astounding. The script and acting are phenomenal. There is not one actor (leading or  supporting) who is not brilliant--and I mean BRILLIANT. It is also  virtually flawless cinematically, and your eyes and ears will love you for  watching it. Watching Lester (Kevin Spacey) transform from a compliant peon  to a person of system-bucking defiance is thoroughly entertaining, and  seeing the relationship develop between Jane and Ricky is a reminder of  what it's like to have your heart engulfed by someone else.<br />So the movie  itself is absolutely PHENOMENAL; but it's disappointing that the DVD does  not include the alternate ending (which focuses on Jane and Ricky after  Lester's murder). It seems likely that it will be released on a later  version, but this movie is SO great, that you may as well have two copies.
6302038308|5.0|man the first time i saw this movie i damn near peep in my pants i laughed  so hard,and i still cant tell if they wanted it to be really scary and  failed or if they wanted funny from the get go but it is most definately  the latter.there must be something here to spawn 3 films,(although the  first was really bad)a video game, and action figures.if you havent seen it  go RENT IT NOW OR BUY IT AND PREPARE TO PEE YOUR PANTS-later
6303022901|5.0|I fought hard not to be subjected to this movie... and I'm glad that my  protests went unheeded.  This is one of the most enjoyable movies that I've  ever had the pleasure to watch.<br />I don't know any of the performers names,  so I can't give a run-down, but the ensemble cast as a whole really  delivered in this one.<br />This movie managed to mix American and Japanese  traditions and lifestyles in an amazing way demonstrating the struggle in  culture and generation gaps.<br />This movie has a lot to give in the way of  enlightenment and entertainment and I would strongly recommend it to  anyone.
B0000028RR|5.0|i have owned this cd for almost 8 years now and it will always have a  secured spot in my cd case,rage will always be a favorite in my book as  well as many others im sure.they have inspired numerous bands and will  continue to do so as long as their recordings are accessible.one of the  main reasons for their success is tom morello who has recieved a law degree  from harvard and is one of if not the best guitarist in the business(settle  for nothing contains the most beautiful guitar solo ive ever heard)and  zachs ability to express himself with violent screams and aggressive  lyrics.anyway if you only buy one rage cd ever let it be this one as its  their best,with a good release of anger towards the government.politically  charged lyrics with           semi-funk-punk-rap-metal.and if you get a  chance to see them live dont miss it because they put on one of the best  live shows-later

0192100289|5.0|Wilkie Collins is considered by many to be the &quot;Inventor&quot; of the modern mystery. I state this not as an absolute, rather as a commonly held  literary opinion. Other reviewers often refer to Mr. Collins in a review of  a Charles Palliser Novel, or many others who are at the top of the Mystery  Genre today. Mr. Collins was also a contemporary, literary collaborator,  and business partner of another rather well known writer, Charles  Dickens.<br />This book later would influence the novel that Charles Dickens  was never to complete \\"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood\\" due to his death in the  midst of writing what was his final novel. There was a common denominator  in these novels and it related to a drug, Laudanum. Mr. Collins was a user  of the substance however I have never read of Mr. Dickens also having used  the drug. When preparing for the book he was never to finish, Collins took  Dickens to the opium dens of London, whether or not Dickens participated is  a mystery along with the ending of his final work.<br />Laudanum is a key  factor in the mystery of the \\"Moonstone\\" that the book revolves around.  Collins wanted to write a story that would be directly impacted by the use  of the drug on a person or persons, with or without their knowledge, and  how their behavior would be affected during a dramatic event while under  the influence.<br />Mr. Collins as mentioned was a consumer of this drug, when  he set out to write the book he stated, \\"he would write the story as it  would have happened, not how it may have happened\\". He was referring to his  own experiences with the opiate, which takes an already complicated plot  and adds the altered behavior Laudanum can have.  The book is as complex as  Palliser's \\"Quincunx\\", but I find it easier to follow \\"Moonstone\\".<br />To the  extent you feel a familiarity with the Author it may be because so much of  what is written today is derivative. The \\"Diamond\\" that plays center stage  in this work during the England of Queen Victoria was astonishingly \\"new\\"  when published. I believe were it published again today under a new title  and Author, it would be found again on the Bestseller Lists, as it was over  a century ago,<br />Mr. Collins writes with an elegant hand, which immerses  the reader and binds him or her to the characters and the roles they play.  The book is not brief as this was a time when Authors wrote as much as was  needed, not what was allowed or could potentially be shown at the local  multiplex.<br />From the moment the diamond is found, and the story unfolds,  clearly for some, less clearly for those who may have been influenced by  something other than the dinner wine, the book will delight any reader of  Mysteries. If Mr. Collins was not the absolute first to write a modern  mystery, he certainly has yet to be surpassed by any other's pen.ueen Victoria was astonishingly \\"new\\"  when published.

014028009X|5.0|Unputdownable.  A great book to make you feel your life isn't so bad.   While reading I just couldn't stop laughing.  Every woman should own a copy  (and make all her friends buy it too)!
B000002NHN|5.0|I first hear about Loreena Mckennitt when I bought a Celtic Christmas CD  from Windham Hill Records, which comprised among other songs one entitled  &quot;Snow&quot;. I was astonished by her angelic voice and for that matter  only I started looking for more of her material, as far as I didn't know  anything else about her.<br /> The subject of religion and spirituality  interest me a lot. I spend hours reading about it and as much as I go  through this experience, it makes me understand better my own role in this  existence. Lately I have been reading a lot about the Celts, their  religions and traditions as well as their influence on generations of many  people in the world.  <br /> Throughout the ages, humankind has been  misguided by the religions about its role and relationship with the  creation and its creator. This statement sounds an amazing paradox as far  as one would expect from them exactly the opposite. The word religion (from  Latin, religare) means the re-establishment of an apparent missing link.  Passing the eyes through the history of religions one could easily realize  that the orthodox religions did not accomplished its task of helping men in  re-establishing that missing connection. <br /> Where religions failed,  science, philosophy and arts in general succeeded in terms of helping  mankind to move towards self-knowledge. I see Loreena Mckennitt's music  under this perspective. She is taking the art of music to a level where the  listener finds a glimpse of a new world: the inner world. Her music has the  ability to put us in touch with a new realm, the spiritual realm. <br />  Taking the Celts and its rich cultural and religious tradition as a  springboard for her music odyssey, she gives us the best and makes us  understand that music has a wider function other than just entertainment.  Everything that Loreena has produced until now is overwhelmingly rich and  pleasant. This rendering &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; is a masterpiece.  All thesongs in it have a divine beauty and an inspiring touch. The song  &quot;Skellig&quot; inspired by Thomas Cahill's &quot;How Irish Saved The  Civilization&quot; makes chills run up one's spine. It throws you in a  delightful journey into the past and makes you understands the reality that  we are all searching for happiness and progress. As the Chinese proverb  says &quot;A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intend to  arrive&quot;, I hope Loreena's journey goes far in time and then we will  have the opportunity to enjoy and learn more about our past and build our  future towards peace and understanding.

It offers very good lyrics,  really original music and sound effects, and it has the advantage that its  in german, a far more superior language when creating such atmosphere. You  should also have to try Herzeleid (their first album) and Live aus Berlin,  the live album. This is a band you will be happy to have heard of.  Guaranteed!!!!!

0767811070|4.0|Some very powerful performances make this by Cuba Gooding Jnr and Lawrence  Fishbourne make this a movie that makes you think. It shows contrasts  between different sort o teens in the hood. Tre(Gooding) is a good kid in a  bad neighbourhood trying to stay out of trouble. Ricky is trying to make a  better future for himself and his family by going to college playing  football. Doughboy is a thug in and out of prison and with no prospects. If  you like hood movies you'll love this but buy Menace II Society first.
014028009X|2.0|I thoroughly was bored by this book.  There was little insight involved in  constructing this narrative.  I felt like i was reading someone's diary who  was too obsessed with the typical, mundane conception of what it is to be a  woman.  If you need to reassure yourself that you have the same neuorses as  other women then go ahead pick this book up, but if you are a woman who  doesnt define yourself by a physical description nor by what  society and  magazines dictate then DONT BOTHER.
158234082X|1.0|This book is boring and even though the author provides some tips about  &quot;what really happened behind the closed restaurant kitchen  doors&quot;, it is done in a very arrogant way.  The book is more about Mr.  Bourdain personal life than  stories about the culinary world. As a  profesional cook I find that the author is a very near minded person and  does not aknowledge people with different taste than his.  Being a  professional cook is to know to satisfy anyone taste with good food without  criticism.  Waist of time and money.
B00004XPP0|5.0|This is a must for your video collection. I can never get tired of watching these movies. It's a classic, with romance, adventure, comedy,  suspense and something more.  This collection is for the entire family,  kids love it and so do grownups. These movies take you to a place where you  become so attached to the feelings of the actors that when something  happens to one of them, you can feel it too. This is a collection that your  grand grand kids will thank you for having it at home. I consider myself a  movie fan, I have seen them all, but only a few of them are in my private  movie library, and the Star Wars Trilogy is my proud and joy. Get it! I  recommend it.

B00003XB8K|1.0|After all the hype and reviews of this CD, I finally broke down and bought  a copy. I'm afraid I can't agree with most of the reviews here. I found  myself thinking about how awful this music was; I found very little  innovation or SOUL in this album, perhaps it lapsed into some kind of  formula, but, nothing sounded as fresh and exciting as the earlier albums.
B00003CWLF|5.0|I thought that this movie was absolutely magnificent...The ending made me cry, and I enjoyed watching how a powerful love affair develops between two  very different people.  I saw the movie three times and I will definitely  see it again.  The movie displays beautiful scenery, architecture, and  costume design.  The acting in the movie is powerful and moving.  I have  never seen a more touching film.  It captivated me the entire 147 minutes.

The catchy tunes of &quot;Rent&quot; and  &quot;Heart&quot; sticks to your mind for long time. By the time you listen  to the &quot;King's Cross&quot; (the last track of the album), you could  not wait to purchase all the PSB's album.
0451169514|5.0|To start off I do have to say that most of the people who don't like this  book are taking it for something it's not. What it is, is a horror novel  and a damn good one at that. It's designed to scare the hell out of you. It  certainly did that to me, I was afraid of sewers for about 2 months after I  first read this book. The horror aspect is enough to have made me read it  the first time but what Stephen King added with the Lucky Seven is what  makes me keep reading it again and again every 6 months or so. I will just  remember a really good part to the story and will have to read it over  again. It's almost like it's part of your own past and you want to relive  it.     Now for the bad part, the only thing I didn't like about this book  was the ending. It didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book. The  other King book I read that seemed to have to same problem to me was Bag of  Bones.      One last note, everyone who said the movie was better then the  book either is too young or too ignorant to really enjoy the depth of the  book, but I suppose a book is like a song, it's never the same to 2  different people.     In summary, definatly give this book at least one  read, if you can handle the 1000+ pages that is. Oh and don't see the movie  before you read the book, it will ruin a few good plot twists in the book.
B00000BKE0|2.0|THE BAND: Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Janick Gers (guitar), Steve Harris (bass), Nicko McBrain (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1990) 10 tracks clocking in at just over 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet that contains band pictures, song credits/titles, song lyrics, and thank you's. Recorded at Steve Harris' Barn somewhere in England on the Rolling Stone Mobile. Cover art by Derek Riggs. Label - Epic. *The digitally remastered version (on Sanctuary Maiden label) released in 2002 offers more in the way of liner notes and videos for your PC.<br /><br />COMMENTS: It's hard for me to write this review, since I've been a fan of Iron Maiden from the beginning. I have their entire collection on disc - Iron Maiden has so many great releases. Some of those (\\"Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Powerslave\\", and \\"Piece Of Mind\\" to name a few) are all-time British metal classics... as well as all-time heavy metal classics. However, there are so many things wrong with \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\". What the heck happened after 1988's \\"7th Son Of A 7th Son\\" (less than 2 years prior)? The sound (production) is flat. Much different from previous albums - Steve Harris' Barn and the Rolling Stone Mobile I'm sure has something to do with it. This was a first for the band recording here (most of their classic 80's material was recorded in the Bahamas or France). Guitar wizard Adrian Smith is gone... working on solo projects and beckoning Dickinson to join him (a few years later he got his wish). For the most part, the melodies are forgettable. And most importantly, the lyrics are silly, or don't fit with the song. Several reviews here trash Dickinson's vocals. I disagree - I think he sounds fine, but the lyrics just don't go with the guitar licks and melodies... leaving an awkward feel to most of this album. \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" is also missing a trademark epic song. It doesn't have to be a 13-minute \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\", but something lengthier than \\"Mother Russia\\" (the longest song on the album at 5:31) would have been nice. Steve Harris is an amazing bassist, but the questionable bass playing on \\"Run Silent Run Deep\\" simply baffles me. The original album cover artwork features Eddie reaching out and choking a man... on the remastered edition, the man is gone and (background) colors are slightly changed. The band's most recent \\"live\\" albums (\\"Death On The Road\\" and \\"Rock In Rio\\") feature NO songs from \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\"... what's that tell you! On the plus side, the songs \\"Holy Smoke\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter\\" made it to their \\"Essential\\" (2005) and \\"Edward The Great\\" (2002) best-of compilations. The latter of the two also made it to \\"Best Of The Beast\\" (1996). While these two songs are easily the best songs on the disc, that's not saying much... they're both weak compared to anything the band did in the 80's. The 3rd best song is \\"Tailgunner\\" - good tune with unconforming lyrics. I've kept the original disc and opted not to trade in for the remastered version - even with better sound quality, it's still an album I won't listen to much. In my opinion, Iron Maiden really struggled in the 90's... two sub par albums with Bruce (\\"Fear Of The Dark\\" was the other one), and two with sad replacement singer Blaze Bailey (\\"X Factor\\" and \\"Virtual Xi\\"). I've tried repeatedly to get \\"into\\" this album over the years... and I simply can't do it (2.5 stars).other Russia\\" (the longest song on the album at 5:31) would have been nice.

B00000IAU3|5.0|Like many I first heard Dido on the beginning credits of  &quot;Roswell&quot;, singing &quot;Here With Me&quot;. From that moment I  simply had to hear more from this new singer I had never heard of before.  The vocals on &quot;Here With Me&quot; were beautiful, and the way the  music builds to the end is an emotional high.<br />The next time I heard one  of her songs was on the radio. The next thing I did was go and buy her cd,  I have not been disappointed. It has fast become one of my &quot;can't live  without&quot; cds.<br />Her style is smooth, soft pop to slightly folky  blues. She has been compared to Sarah McLauchlan vocally, but I would have  to say she is kind of a cross between Sara and Sinead O'Connor. No  mistaking though, she has her own individual style.<br />The songs very a  little on the disc, from sleepy slow to bounce around. There are some  upbeat tunes with a driving beat, like: &quot;Take My Hand&quot;. And  slower tunes like &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot;. It's an incredibly soft song  with the sound of gulls and waves, you can almost picture yourself in a  beach house with the smell of the ocean. My personal favorite is  &quot;Thankyou&quot;. She sings about a bad day where everything goes  wrong, but all she needs is to look at her love's picture or see him smile,  and suddenly she must thank him for the best day of her life.<br />In my  opinion Dido is a very talented singer, with one of the best debut albums  out there. Jump on the bandwagon and become one of her fans that was  &quot;there from the beginning&quot;!!

B000002GOZ|5.0|Bryan Adams , the phenominal force of Rock/Pop Genre since early 80's , is  till date one of my favorite entertainers in the world of music. Yes , the  most low profiled and soft spoken person , Bryan Adams even today can  deliver a smash live performance. Which brings my attention to his album  &quot; Bryan Adams - Unplugged &quot;. I first saw the unplugged show on  MTV , and after every song i was like wow..Unplugged sounds so good..and it  especially sounded good cuz the music versions were completely different ,  soft , giving a new and improved life to his previously hit tracks such as  &quot; summer of 69 &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; , &quot; cuts like a  knife &quot; , &quot; im ready &quot; , &quot; when you love someone &quot;  , &quot; the only thing that looks good on me &quot; , &quot; lets make a  night to remember &quot; etc etc.<br />The album has a collection of his  classic hits performed live with totally new beats and instruments such as  flutes and violins . It also contains a couple of uptempo tracks such as  &quot; the only thing that looks good on me &quot; which is far more better  than it's original album version. <br />If you're looking for an album which  has good beats , good music , great songs , with a spice of classical touch  too. Pick this one. <br />I Think this one so far is the best Unplugged album  ever. No Other artists can beat this. Personally , as for me , i think this  album is truly a masterpiece. The Best Bryan Adams Album ever. A  collector's item. <br />Let me put it in more simple terms , Its Bryan Adams .  Quality rest assured ! :)
B00000JGOH|1.0|First of all, I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow was nearly good enough in this  movie for Best Actress.  She shouldn't have even been nominated!  Cate  Blanchet on the other hand (she was in ELIZABETH.  Came out same  year--1998) was far better than Gwyneth!  I love to watch movies that take  place during Medival or Renaissance times.  Shakespeare in Love proves that  not all of them are good.
B000002WYT|5.0|I got this CD after listening to both &quot;Before these crowded  Streets&quot; and &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; and I was  impressed.  While this CD does have a few slow points like &quot;Cry  Freedom&quot; which wasn't like I expected, it has several wonderful songs  such as &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; a personal DMB favorite, &quot;Crash  into Me&quot; &quot;Drive in, Drive Out&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot; amongst  others.  It seems that on this CD they found the balance of lyrics and  music.  On &quot;Before...&quot; the music was good and for the most part  so were the lyrics but on &quot;Under the Table...&quot; it was a mixed bag  at some points.  They've taken basically the high point on this second  outing and it shows they've learned a lot since their debut on  &quot;Remember Two Things&quot;<br />While this isn't anything compared to a  live concert performance, it's still highly reccomend to any DMB fan.  And  a non DMB fan should try this too, there's a good chance they'll start  liking the band after listening to this album.
