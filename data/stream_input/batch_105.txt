B00FMOHB06|5|Received these as expected for use in just finishing Polar Vortex storm. Kept my feet nice and warm in the -13 deg temp and -39 windchill.  Fit was correct.
B0007OF2QQ|1|This deserves no stars because I didn't get my hat when I should have.
B00AMB2QFE|5|I love the way this jacket fits. The leather  is very soft and the double zipper gives it a little extra style.
B00E6EOLMY|5|I purchased this for a recent beach trip. We didn't leave our baby exposed to the sun for very long lengths of time but the time he was in the sun this worked perfectly to protect his skin. I purchased this in the 9-12 month size, my son is average size and isn't quite 9 months yet. Depending on how much he grows I'm not sure it will last us for the entire summer. I'm happy with the size I purchased but if you're child is larger than average you may want to size up.
B003RANA3E|4|Looks good. Since it isn't fitted, there are some areas that don't conform to the body as well as one might like. But for an online purchase/gift, it gets the job done.
B00EFEPIEA|4|The shirt fits nicely but the description said that it was either a 2 pack or a 4 pack, but it was neither. I only received one shirt.
B00G56DA0U|5|It us a beautiful dress, fits perfectly an the cilors are simply great
B00QT4ZYXO|1|nice and roomy as described.unfortunately fabric is of poor quality and &#34;pilled&#34; terribly all across the front on my first wearing, prior to even washing garment. i will be returning for a refund.
B00HGEML3M|2|Almost seethrough
B0018OHQ9K|4|as expected even better than I thought, thank you .. very good quality product ... thanks for fulfilling my expectations ..
B001ELJMNA|4|Normal
B00L12C8J2|5|Love the fit & look.
B005MESR7M|1|Not what I expected at all.  I am returning it.
B00J9QRA4A|5|Still works for a little Farm Princess.  Warm.  Little John Deeres all over.  Love it.
B008FVRI4C|5|Who knew you could get a great tie for so cheap? Pattern great, quality really not so shabby at all. I bought this for Gold Cup -- my boyfriend didn't own anything nearly preppy enough. My roommate said he would hire me to go tie shopping for him, and my bf wants a million more just like it and he had never liked skinny ties before. I will be looking at their other patterns!
B000ZFRJN6|4|I made the mistake of ordering according to Asian-Size which made it come very big, however, the material is great and the it is very warm. Perfect to wear in cold weather.
B00551OSG6|5|Fits good
B005ZZBIBK|5|I got exactly what is shown on the picture. I got a little scared with other reviews about sizing, but in my case, the fit was perfect - and I would even dare to say they are a little too comfortable (for reference...I am 5.5' and I weigh 160lbs - I ordered the Large). When I use leggings, I like them to be really tight, and the large is not as tight as I want them to be, so I might be getting a medium as well.<br />The zipper on the ankle gives it that sexy edgy touch, and quality seems to be really good.
B004AALWFS|5|Usually by shirts from Express in size (S).  to get the same fit from this shirt i ordered a (L).  Very Tight fitting shirt, great material, always feel like im gonna bust out but the quality says NO.
B00DQXRQOG|5|fit great
B00DBVBK4U|4|the color is great. the material is light and warm. its perfect with jeans and for cloudy and raining days
B004M6UDC8|5|love it!
B00I1CFL4Y|5|I ordered two long black coats from this company.  They arrived as promised and I've already worn them.  Very soft!  Worth the wait!
B002GHC2XI|4|This jacket is a great value.  The external Duck fabric is tough but not rough.  I bought this and the Arctic lined jacket at the same time.  The quilted lining seemed warmer, so I kept this one and returned the other.  Other than the lining, both jackets are exactly the same. Below are a few key observations:  Pros:  1.  Durable  2.  Warm  3.  Nylon lined sleeves keep shirt sleeves from riding up when putting the jacket on  4.  Lot of jacket for the money  5.  Wind resistant  6.  Quality zipper  Cons:  1.  This runs small.  I weight 160 and the medium is well fitted.  It also runs short.  2.  As another reviewer noted, the front hand pockets are small and unlined.  They will provide no warmth in the winter.    3.  Stiff at first  4.  Attached hood can get in the way
B00WXPCWY2|5|There's not much to this wallet... which is the point.  It holds the cards I need (six, currently, but could take a few more) securely and takes up as little space as possible in my pocket.<br /><br />When I first got this a couple of weeks ago, I told my son he could have my old wallet if this one worked out.  Looks like I'll be handing the old leather one off to him soon.<br /><br />Edit on 6/15/16:  I've been using this wallet for almost a year now.  Still loving it.  I can't envision ever going back to a bigger, bulkier wallet.  Still 5 stars!
B009HUPZIQ|5|These are supper cute! I love the little same colored sparkles and the trim at the bottom. I am 5'3 and 155 pounds and size 10 was very comfortable. Even after I wash them their not too tight and don't loose their shape. I love that they aren't love rise and go up to my belly bottom or just below. NYDJ are a terrific brand!!!
B004G9OIU4|5|Best pair of Levi's jeans I have bought!
B000PBRAE8|5|this bra gives me plenty of support and lift.  I even exercise in these bras.  and I love the option in color.  being DDD, the stores don't have much selection on color and it's great to change it up.  really great support.
B00D9AFRE2|2|This is more like a Hoodie style T-shirt.  It's 100 % cotton, but still thin.  As for sizing, it runs somewhat small.<br />Will be sent back.
B0029F1WWE|2|I waited until the week before Halloween to order this, so I guess part of the blame is mine.  But I paid for overnight shipping and I didn't expect to receive anything other than the item I ordered.  Boy was I wrong.  The uniform top that showed up in the mail was nothing like the item description from the manufacturer.  The logo was not \\"embroidered\\" as stated.  Instead, it was a cheap plastic pin-on.  The size was relatively small and it was poorly cut.  All those issues aside, I need a costume in 3 days and would have kept this, but they SENT ME THE WRONG SIZE!  The package had clearly been opened before I got it (it wasn't folded like it would have been from the manufacturer.  While the outer packaging stated the correct size, the contents were a different size.  As a result, the outfit is unusable.  The Amazon rep I spoke with to process the return was shockingly nice and spoke clear english - I think she might even have been IN THE USA!  Crazy, I know.  Still, she couldn't ship me a replacement in time for Halloween...  Avoid this item - it's not as advertised!
B0038AB5Y4|3|The bra itself is a little constraining so I would recommend getting a size larger. It is also very hard to reach the clasp, I have to use a mirror sometimes. While exercising it does a great job of holding the &#34;girls&#34; together. I like this bra, but not enough to buy another at this time.
B00MY4MDBE|5|Sherpa lining almost makes this a replacement for a winter coat.  Thick lining that is very soft
B00ADJE7K2|5|Had looked for a swim shirt but did not like the heavy weight of others I had tried on (Lands End).  This one was perfect.  It was lighter weight and less restricting.  It has a tshirt fit so it is more comfortable.
B00A86S1UW|2|Returned the dress because it runs really small and the material shows every lump or bump on your body (not the good ones)!
B009L5AY3S|5|This is really cute.  My daughter in law loved it.  She wore it to work as her costume and got big tips all night.
B00GW12R48|3|The shorts are okay. A little longer than expected but not baggy or below the knees. The main issue I had is the material is made of a course fabric that tends to snag if it brushes up against anything. The Puma logo is also cheaply applied, basically just a plastic sticker that will probably tear off over time.
B00902ZQWQ|5|I needed some lined cargos for winter and I found these to fit well and are a quality made product!
B009U759BY|3|Fly tends to open slightly during the day. Fit is good and comfortable, enjoyable to wear but again the fly tends to open some so you end-up with some &#34;exposure&#34;.
B000UK0XUM|5|I loved the pants ,but they were bigger than expected. I should of listened to the reviews. I wear a 20. I bought a 2x.I am returning for a smaller size. Great feel and material is solid.
B00DSQSBYA|5|My husband loves these. He now owns 3 pairs because they don't give him a rash and they stay down
B00D89Y2J0|2|I should have listened to the reviews when I bought this shirt. It was entirely too small. Fit really goofy. I won't be wearing it. Ever.
B00CX2JQFS|5|For FR pants these are 5 star! They are definitely lightweight compared to normal Wranglers and working in Texas heat that's good. The fabric is the same as normal Wranglers, just thinner. .
B008Z9FDS2|4|This shirt fits like a glove, feels good on the skin due to quality of material, and looks great - I've had good feedback from friends
B0055NV87G|5|Looks good .
B004HHO8AK|3|I bought my normal size in these shorts (28), but they were slightly big so I returned them for one size down.  The size 27 fit fine when I first put them on, but within an hour, they were sagging in the rear (though the waist was okay).  I would not purchase these again.      If you want denim shorts that hold their shape and are super stylish, go with J Brand instead.
B000V9FNWU|5|The service was very good and what I expected recibir.Muy good, keep it up, thank you
B00IWXQGLY|5|This bra is high quality. It fits well and is very comfortable. I am very satisfied with it. I recommend it. I wish it was available in black.
B005GYGEWS|3|They are fine.  They are a soft stretchy material.  They are not tight at all.  I actually prefer more of a compression/tighter capri for my workout shorts.  That is the main reason they only get 3 stars.  They are really comfortable because they are so stretchy though.  They feel like I'm not wearing any shorts at all.
B00B73O2TE|5|I bought this for my aging mother to prevent leakage from diapers.<br />Works as described. Very happy with the purchase.<br />Would recommend.<br />Anna B
B003NX8DJ6|5|I GAVE THIS TO MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVES IT.  IT FITS PERFECT.  I AM THINKING ABOUT ORDERING ONE FOR MYSELF.
B0000863HK|5|This is a must have, particularly for ladies who are \\"very\\" blessed! The straps are not flimsy, they help provide solid support without cutting your shoulders. It's comfortable, doesn't feel like a Silence of the Lambs Harness!<br />I didn't buy my first one ..., but at this price I will be buying the next one ...! Well worth the price of admission!
B00LIWP3PQ|2|My daughter 15 months... It is said  can use in 24 months but it to small for her
B00K5PD7XM|4|Excellent Levi, finally good to have a pair that fits so well.  I wore khaki pants for a couple years and they were either to shiny type no iron or regular which got all wrinkly all the time.  The Levi 559 fits well wears well and looks good all the time, they feel great and make me feel good.  Thanks
B00BEU1QSA|5|Bought 17 masks, everyone in the family wore them with Grinches shirts, so funny, thanks for the prompt service.
B00N7JYC9Q|5|Good quality and look just like the pictures.
B001JBNDLM|3|good deal, but the leg openings stretch out over time and get loose.
B0055X23IY|3|size is smaller than normal. looks great on a sexy Girl Friend. purchased it as a cool surprise and it did the job
B00SFK7UIC|5|It is just perfect in every way--he won't take it off !!!
B00E4J50GC|5|Santa got this for my mother afters she returned to the cold weather and she loves it. Nice color and very soft.
B00J6IKUTI|5|Awesome
B0042L6D90|5|The hat is perfect!
B00DRZUMUS|5|This top is comfortable and layers well with other clothing. I live in a cold climate, but some places where I go are often overheated. This is a great layer for indoors in a warm room, and looks good with jackets. I'm very glad I bought it. The color is true to what it shows on the picture, too.
B004YZ848W|5|My almost 4-year-old daughter has been complaining of wedgies ever since she was potty trained at 2 1/2. She wore the thick training underwear for a long time because they didn't ride up, but they were bulky and not so easy to wear with leggings and skinny jeans. I found these for her, and when she first put them on she broke out in giggles and danced around the room. Now she has fun, colorful underwear that fits nicely under her slim fitting pants without giving her wedgies. Just for reference, she is about 37 inches tall and weighs 31 pounds, and they fit her perfectly. Very happy with this purchase!
B00EDQ79BU|5|Freaking awesome colors!!! Best top i have bought in a long time! Buy the thong too!!! I'm a 36D (natural) fits amazing!
B009980QPI|5|a little on the heavy side for some
B00HHKLPQO|5|Great shirt
B0077KKELQ|5|It looks good.I love it so much.It is a gift for my friend .Hope he will love it as much as I do.
B00K8O1CDC|5|Muy bueno
B00K44JEQI|4|Warm and functional.
B008D3BMOY|5|is a product of very good quality, brand and price. I recommend it to all people who are in search of something. Besides, it is very nice, I loved it.
B0040C1QUC|5|For my son's wedding I wanted a dress that was carefree--wouldn't easily wrinkle or stain, wouldn't require heavy undergarments or a personal fitness trainer, would be completely comfortable, yet I would feel beautiful and feminine. I saw this on line, ordered it, and after trying it on---didn't look at any other dresses.<br /><br />I am 5'8'', 165 lbs, (large-boned, size 11 feet) long in the legs but short-waisted, wear 10-12tall jeans, 38C bra. Because other reviews said the dress runs large, I ordered size 10 and it was perfect. (If I'd been 10 lbs lighter I would have needed to go down a size however) I wore the dress to my son's June afternoon wedding. The dress fits so well, and the cummerbund waist is so supportive, that I could have skipped the bra. I purchased a &#34;backdrop necklace&#34; from an online Bridal jewelry shop, to complement the deep v-neckline in the front and back. The outer layers and draping change colors as you move, almost irridescent. I received dozens of compliments, and would definitely consider buying other colors or the knee-length version. Amazon price was HALF of the Nordstrom's price!! Thank you Amazon!
B009FETG3O|5|We had our sons 1 year pictures taken in this hat and they turned out amazing!!! Looks super cute on!
B00CZ6LFZ6|5|The jeans we received are made well from durable fabric. We have laundered them multiple times and they continue to look good. They also  fit my daughter perfectly.
B001FFOE8S|5|It's perfekt
B00US7DGAG|4|Shirt was much larger than expected, but my grandson kept it.
B007MS52OC|5|Nice
B005CJZ0XG|1|It is to small....
B00K000A6Y|4|Feels soft and made well.  I'll buy mire
B00SU6IIEG|2|Too large another fabric feels a little cheap. I am returning it.
B00KR9QHN8|3|The dress was beautiful but in order for the dress to fit nicely I would have had to go up like 2 more sizes due to  lining. I had already gone up 2 sizes and it still didn't work and my normal size is a 14.
B00HSQ6256|5|Got compliments from other RVN veterans on the looks.
B00KAGTK96|5|Fit great; stay on baby's feet!
B00F0K53QG|5|Love it
B00K5LKTLO|5|Good quality, warm, serves well what it's built to do.
B00D8XAO7K|5|First of all. this item from M.O.D. is selling in EU - Deutchland for cca 285 € - cca 385 USD /EURUSD 1,3555/ VAT included. I have bought it for without shipment cost for a 155 USD which is 114 € which is 60% discount. In EU the discont price for this model is 225 € - 304 USD but not for this collor /just orange-brown/. I have expected lower quality second-class - item was brand new, but not first-class. I have discovered 4  2mmx2mm small surfaces and 1 bigger surfaces cca 1cmx1cm without collor. On these surfaces collor was rubbed - I do not know why -  it is possible via transport or seller has exported second-class item or used-returned item. Textil surfaces was partially polluted from collor and beeswax. I have repaired these imperfections within two hours overpaint surfaces with mixed collor white-brown-green by me and properly waxed with my beeswax - now it is good!! In Slovakia many sellers are incorrect and sell second-class item for very high price and we have learned, that sometimes the return it is not the best solution. I am actually proud, that I am inventive man. I want actually not overpay shipments cost. The amazon price policy is 5 star. Because I have bought this item for 156 USD, but I have received item from EU department of amazon - so I have to NOT pay VAT -which is difference between /30USD/ 156 USD and current price 126 USD. It was very correct. For this price it was very good deal. I love amazon and *b*y and al**x*r*ss :-) they save my money.
B004DMYMU0|5|Product just as described
B000SKHOTC|1|you get what you pay for...cheap price, cheap product.  Looks nothing like the picture on the package.  You'll look more like Delta Burke than Elvis!
B00ACIGRNO|5|Great fit very confortable and so far they appear to be very durrable.  If they hold up I will be purchaseing additional.
B005FXE9WM|5|I bought it for a costume, but it has become useful for working underneath the car or banked derby track.
B0040MKFVI|5|Good job!!!
B01481JCRI|5|This is lovely especially for a nice family bike ride and it has a great speed safe for the children's ride this on family trips and hiking trips it rides lovely
B00TFCM06G|3|pretty but a little skimpy on the size - wearable but not totally comfortable
B004UULOWY|5|Overall, I'm sold on this costume. First of all, the fabric quality is good and the embroidery is rather impressive. Secondly, the price was reasonable (under 30 bucks, not to shabby). Lastly, love the colors. A nice shade of red and olive green do mesh well together. I have a garland that will give it a oh-so-nice touch. Definitely RenFaire worthy and looking forward to wearing it. Needless to say, five stars in my book. BTW, even my hubby is impressed.
B00KRM0WUE|4|lightweight and great for using after the hot tub
B00NXKI3S0|3|Material neither stretches nor stays on. Very poorly made. Vendor did not examine workmanship closely. Whoever made it should not be allowed to sell this to anyone. Will keep as inside-boot liner. Nobody will see.
B00IJJFRD4|4|Looks cute!
B00HWFCL94|3|These shorts are comfortable enough although they lack pockets. The material is soft and lightweight. If these had pockets, I would give them a 5/5 but since they do not, just a 3/5
B00N54S1SQ|4|im satisfied for the price I paid...:)
B00K8QAEKM|5|Nice quality. Fit as expected
B00AECT1ZE|5|Fits perfectly. I have a size 14 foot and they fit great.
B00NSS480O|3|these seem to run a little big.  they slide down some... I find I keep having to pull them up.  I wore them for a workout routine but I could not wear them running.  I wont be buying anymore of these.... not really impressed.
B001HS4L8Q|4|The charger works well. I'm very satisfied with the purchase. The blue led light is sometimes very bright at night, but besides that it is a good product.
B003YHOJEY|5|I ordered this shirt then went back and saw it says Young Men's.  Well I am not young anymore but it is a Men's shirt so it will fit.  I recieved the shirt yesterday and love it.  The colors are awesome and I know that if you are as big a fan as I you will love it too.  Great seller, Fast shipping, I will definately buy from the seller again.
B0035JKVJS|5|I purchased similiar shorts in a Vanity Fair outlet last year.  I really like the style and length.  Their not too tight or too loose.  They do run fairly true to size.  I don't like bermuda style shorts or daisy dukes so these were just the perfect length.
B007HRWJD0|5|The fit is good. This fabric is cool and doesn't require ironing
B001VNY6GE|5|Well had and true to less wrinkle claim good quality and great price.
B000XZTLHU|5|These shorts are 100% cotton and a very nice style, with a comfortable wide waistband and a perfect length.  The sizes run generous in my opinion.  I normally wear a large or even extra large on some of these less expenseive brands of gym-type shorts, but I had to return my size Large and exchange for a medium.  I would highly recommend these.  Also, Amazon's customer service was amazing.  Free shipping and free return as well!
B007BLNMWE|4|Good shirt for the price
B00GOG5XM4|5|Slim just like stated
B001A9YQVE|5|Came super fast. Shipper was awesome. This company definitely had urgency with grtting their customers their product. I love it thank you.
B00HVWSQG0|1|These are so thin I can see my skin through the fabric. I'd have given a negative rating if that were possible.
B00EOIESSO|4|I have to give it a 4 stars. the black polo is kinda too big for 17 months old. The Shirt fits perfectly and the pants he only uses it few times beacsue it has gotten small on him.
B00H9WV1K0|3|Very thin and not very long, color is beautiful.
B004FEEZ80|4|This hat is very light and breathable- a necessity especially in hotter climates. Washes very easily and dries quickly. I am not a fan of the design but my husband said it was cute. Has two strings to tie it under the chin. My daughter simply rips this off her head so not sure how much use we will get out of this particular hat.
B00HZSBOO6|5|Wonderful. The heel grip is perfect.
B000SV8OWM|5|These leggings really complete and outfit. They are well made and add pizzaz to skirts or under pants. My granddaughter loves them.
B00PH40PTK|5|It's perfect!!!!
B002U37R1K|5|Purchased two of these scarves as gifts.  They are much more rich-looking and beautiful than shown in the photograph.  The length is nice, and they have a very silky feel to them.  I would highly recommend them to any music lover.
B004QC0F3U|3|medium  is  too  small  large is too big
B00J8AH3G2|1|Didn't,t like design
B00DB3FV8Y|5|nice and great
B000L6RVGE|3|the shirt isnt as good as I expected... its a costume and made as such and the mask is foam
B00DSQQL2O|3|These are really beautifully-made jeans. Nice and weighty fabric, too. I sized down, because that usually works best for me in Hudson. Wow, these weren't even close! I barely buttoned them, and they are very low-rise, like below the naval. I'm not sure if the other reviewer received the same pair that I did, because they fit entirely different on me.<br /><br />If you like very low-rise jeans, order your normal size or one size up on these.
B00F4OPFYI|5|Love this top. It's the perfect weight for cooler temperatures. It fits nice.
B00NGG47ZY|4|I am 5'5 and weight 126lbs.  I usually wear a small or medium, thought it would be save to order a large knowing that the items from China usually runs small.  I actually need an X-large.  Thé style is cute and thé quality is very good for that price.
B00MG7OD2Q|4|Somewhat small
B00D74NH7Y|1|I just received these and I am extremely disappointed. They are already back in the package to be returned. Although they are somewhat cute they are not Natori quality in the least bit. They are no where near worth $70. I could buy the same damn thing at Walmart for a fraction of the cost. I don't shop at Walmart for many reasons, one of them being I want better quality. These pajamas are very thin and the material is poor quality, it is not even soft. The sleeves and legs are not even folded over with a hem, they just end. I can just imagine how quickly they will fray after washing. I certainly wasn't planning to keep these but including this information in case someone is still considering purchasing them. This is the first time I've purchased Josie by Natori pjs so I'm guessing this is a lesser quality line. I will not purchase in the future. I love Natori quality and will stick with that. For the money and quality I would have been better off to purchase a second pair of Natori Feathers pj set. I highly recommend these. They are very soft and very comfortable and a high quality fabric.
B009FG8FMU|4|Dont panic when you first receive these socks, they are enormous!  But, they havent been preshrunk.  Just wash in hot and dry once (I used high for this occasion), and voila. Normal size.
B00JXRRWWA|5|My Dad loved it.
B00I1D9202|5|Nothing better then Stance!
B00OG6STDO|5|These gloves fit nicely and they help me keep stable on the mat when doing yoga so I'm not constantly sliding forward
B00SCWSWRQ|4|Being that Jessica Simpson is relatively busty, I was surprised how snug if felt at the bust &loose at the waist. Still a very cute dress. It has pockets!<br />I love dresses with pockets.
B007XD50QQ|5|The back of this shirt  is really pretty. That's my favorite part of it. I Love it Is Gorgeous .
B00AMTJ0VO|5|Perfect fit for me. Delivered to my door quickly. All my Alfred Dunner pants have been great. I wanted these for my 4 day cruise. Can't wait to wear them. Thanks.
B009SZFJH2|2|This is a very light weight sweater.  The lines and details (like the zipper pull fob) are very nice.  However, XXXL is WAY smaller than it should be.  I placed it over an XXL t-shirt and the t-shirt was about four inches wider than this XXXL sweater.  Could have been mis-marked, but I'm not going to bother trying another.  I returned this one.
B000783WV4|4|I purchased these socks three months ago; while they are very comfortable, recently some of them have started ripping at the heels. If you are quite physically active, I recommend buying cheaper socks that will last just as long. If you have a more sedentary lifestyle, these are fine.
B0058YHKDI|5|Great rain coat. I normally buy large when it comes to jackets although the medium fit me like a glove I thought it might be too snug if I wore something a little bulkier underneath so I purchased a size large. The large was more generous and accommodating to additional clothes but the hood was huge! If I use the rain hood and tighten it to fit me more snuggly it covers my eyes completely. I have to wear a knit hat if I want to use the hood and still see otherwise I'm constantly adjusting the hood so I can see as I navigate the crowded sidewalks of Manhattan. I don't have this hood issue with the medium sized rain coat.
B0018OXGZ8|3|These are great jeans overall, but my son is a weight lifter, and he finds these to be too small for his thighs.  The jeans themselves are a great brand.
B00063W3XS|5|Just what I wanted. Wish I could have gotten it in white.
B00JZLX85Y|4|I typically wear a size 1x or 2x depending on how the garment is made (I have big boobs).  I ordered up because I wanted to make sure I had plenty of room for my breasts.  Even with ordering up the top half of the dress was a bit too small for me - the bottom half fit perfectly.  It did look beautiful on my daughter though so I'm keeping it.
B00827RTRU|3|They fit well, but the material creates constant static cling so my skirts and dresses stick to it awkwardly.
B0087D7CTE|5|Large fan and very beautiful.
B005I0ITMI|4|Great quality of Carhartt, but the size of this item run very large.  I ordered an XL, and it is huge!  Have to return it for a size smaller, and that's inconvenient.  So, it lost a star.
B00AYDNF8W|5|Great shirt.  I love the fact you can wear any color  beneath it.  I receive compliments whenever I wear it.
B00399155I|5|Yes, this shirt looks better when you get it then it even does in the picture.  One of my favorite shirts, hate to wash it cause I can't wear it till I'm done.
B00AM5MUL0|5|My first thermal, keeps me warm in a chilly house in San Francisco, loving it.
B003T9Z3K6|2|Cheaply Made....my son looked like a sperm, lol.  I wouldn't recommend it.  The thrift store didn't even want it.  Don't bother.
B00D75KZXC|1|thought was ordering kids XL not adult Xl
B002EUBBRA|3|I purchased this to wear at work for Halloween. I had to purchase a large to be eligible for 2 day shipping. I usually wear a medium but sacrifices had to be made with the time constraint. When it arrived, the body of the shirt fits equivalent to a large, but the sleeves were about 6&#34; past the tips of my fingers. The quality of this product isn't anything great (nor did I expect it to be) but it's probably not worth the $23. It is what it is...
B00CTUWA4S|5|it fit's me perfectly once I loosened the lace. it was also really comfortable and I can wear it for a few hours.
B00CB35DA6|4|I order I size up a medium but I shouldnt. I wear a 4 and the small would have been good for me.
B0089CPHAY|5|These shorts are great! Light weight and they dry quickly. Perfect for boating and water sports! I bought 3 pairs!
B00L61RIMU|4|Not Big enough.  Too Snug. loved it, but not a keeper
B00B9PQJX2|3|The fabric and the color is great.  The fit is good.  The back pocket buttons.  I stopped carrying a bag when I got my second dog so I need all my pockets to carry what I once carried in my purse.  When you don't button it, it looks weird and whatever is in that back pocket sometimes falls out.  If you don't use all your pockets and keep that back pocket buttoned, you'll like these.
B00O5Z8IO6|4|Go one size up if you are curvy and if you have a long torso do not bother. I had to give it away
B002LE85X2|2|The socks are adorable but the description says two pair, I only received one pair.
B00R27LAZI|5|soft,supple,well made
B00Q7IMEH6|3|The socks are cute. They are soft which is nice. The only issue is the socks tend to slide down so I am pulling them up quite often. They also tend to be a bit small overall; however the toes are a bit big.
B00GD3VH32|3|My little guy weighs 35lbs. I ordered him a 3t, fits pretty good by the neck hole is smaller than normal shirts. He loves bubble guppies and loves this shirt.
B000FALMFW|2|Looking for jeans that wouldn't sag in the rear.  These were too tight in the waist.
B0020BA0P2|5|It's always hard finding a good strapless bra in the larger sizes, but this one holds up very well. I have no problems with it slipping down and it's very comfortable, not to mention it looks great.
B00DTVRGIQ|5|I always wear cardigans, whether it be for casual or a more dressy look, and it is not easy to find a really nice quality cardigan that not only has a quality look, but keeps it after laundering! This cardigan is absolutely awesome!!! It's quality all over !!!! I have looked at cardigans over $100 that weren't this nice!! It is more on the casual side, but can certainly be dressed up to a mid degree as well! I had ordered charcoal & black. Charcoal is beautiful! (so is the black, but black is black) I am going to order 2 more!! I haven't been this happy w/ a purchase for a long time!!
B0051U16ZM|5|Fit perfectly and very comfortably. Nicely padded without being thick. Very comfortable.
B007MBRZOE|4|This is a very comfortable tank top - I could wear it everyday.
B005GYGGRG|4|So these aren't Lululemon like some of the reviews insinuate, but they are some of the best leggings I may have ever owned. I bought the black and the gray and the gray seem slightly less transparent than the black. They hold their shape well. I've washed them several times now, but they do get a little looser if you wear them more than a day between washing/drying. I've worn them jogging and to yoga and I find that they move easily and are absorbent. Overall, it was a good purchase.
B00HPYHQG0|5|The clothes from this company always fit me perfect.
B00A9I7NDA|4|Great deal for Christmas in July
B00S67RA3E|4|Small across chest...runs way too smll
B00E3HBKCI|5|I bought these for my husband as a gift<br />True to size<br />Comfortable to wear<br />Plenty of padding where needed
B00222U6W6|4|This pretty floral print defines your diva status. Allover print tunic with a solid round neckline, full sleeves, and designer print in the front and the same design runs straight in both side of the sleeves to give it a finished look.
B00CODM5K4|5|My husband bought one for me, I was paying for a hair style and my beautician saw mine...  long story short, I bought one for her because I am so pleased with mine.  She will love it and be totally surprised.
B00FSODOXS|5|excellent
B00S8WXTZU|5|Looks great! I enjoy it! Just a little smaller than expected, but I may have a big head hahaha
B005C9FTUK|5|Got so many compliments! Got the small and fits my petite frame but definitely enough room for stretching. So Sexy.
B006SHOBL8|3|I cannot comment on the shirt because Eddie Bauer sent the wrong item.  Even though it was their mistake, they will not refund the shipping cost and I have to pay to send the wrong item back.  So essentially it cost me around $16.00 in shipping for nothing.
B001KSXUYY|5|GRANDDAUGHTER WANTED TO BE EDWARD WAS NOT A GOOD FIT
B00J7TVR6G|2|I thought variety pack would mean variety, what I got was 4 packages of the exact same thing, there was a white pair, a solid color pair and a striped pair in each of the 4 packages but it was all the same in each package. I'm Somewhat disappointed that there wasn't more variety, I thought there would be something different in each package of 3.
B007DK4WFY|4|A very unique Stones shirt in a sea of lips and tongues, this stands out.
B003U3IITE|4|This  scarf is lighter than a winter muffler but a bit heavier than a summery chiffon scarf. The fabric drapes well and doesn't slip. Nice long length. Good value for very few dollars.
B00GBULKK2|3|Not quite what I expected a little itchy. However I am very allergic.  It was one of first purchases.  However it is very warm-so gonna wash in dreft: crossing my fingers...\\"very Warm\\" This proved to be my winter rescue from the frigid winter -17 makes 30 degrees feel like a heat wave.  Wash the garment un softner..I wash more than once a week mostly because of the make up issue.  Also I play with to change the pointed tip adjust to your liking.  Note the gloves are great however I wear another pair that match coat and give an appealing look..enjoy...
B005WXZJ0Q|5|I love this blouse, it is silky and super comfortable.  It is really low cut, so beware if you purchase it and aren't expecting that.  Other than that, it is exactly what I was looking for and true to size.
B00B93TZWQ|5|Excellent
B00ET1V3UW|5|I love these panties! It feels like I don't have any on. Will purchase again.
B002VWHURQ|5|perfect fit!
B00OBL4BBI|5|Got one of these for my spouse and one for me. We both love 'em. Lightweight and soft. Not itchy. Warm but not hot. Good shoulder season hat in Northeast, but wouldn't cut it on a really cold, windy day. The shape has a good amount of slouch.
B00NHQ4AXM|5|These are great shorts, fit well and suitable for business casual or a party with friends
B008LY6AKQ|4|The quality of the color, fabric and finishes are excellent<br />The scrubs are very comfortable and nicely carved<br />I recommend it to all those who require scrubs
B004VQ9B4A|4|I have several pairs of these pants and all have fit the same but my last order had a very different cut, the waist size is about an inch too small. I ordered size 32 as always and it was more like a 31 and really tight at the thigh.
B008ZAYL6Q|4|I bought a few dresses from amazon to wear in Vegas! I dressed two of my other friends for a night on the town!
B008NFZ5U4|1|not a all what I expected. No fringe around the rear.
B00BRE6PBG|3|The lime green eyelet dress is a good cotton eyelet material.  The color is a nice lime green.<br />However it is alittle big for a 12 month old size.
B001VNBAWM|5|Bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it. Looks super classy and stylish on him!
B000FLT8D4|4|i must concur with all the other reviews - this \\"dress\\" is very much just a long tank top.<br /><br />the material is very thin and it is form fitting, just as a wife beater would be.  another reviewer stated, \\"be sure you are comfortable with showing your body,\\" and that's very true because there is no hiding anything in this \\"dress.\\"<br /><br />i'm a size 6-8, depending on the clothes and i bought a large, thinking it would not be as skin tight and there would a little more wiggle room.  no.  i believe these may run a little small because, while the length is great (i'm 5'5' and it comes close to my knees), overall it is stuck to me like a second skin.<br /><br />i can live with it because i primarily wanted these \\"dresses\\" for around-the-house.  they're perfect for that or for a very hot day, as they are very breezy feeling.  i'm comfortable with my body but still wouldn't wear this in public. it IS see through and i don't wear anything underneath it when i'm home.<br /><br />the only MAJOR con i had with this order was the shipping.  they waited two weeks before they even shipped my order out.  it seems they could have gotten it out sometime before that!!!  if you order this dress, give yourself enough time if it's a gift or you need it for something.  you may have to wait a while to receive it.
B000NPX1K8|5|I've been wearing Victoria's Secret underwear for years, but haven't been happy with them for the past few seasons as it seems they've changed the cuts. I ordered a pair of Barely There Breathe Bikinis after reading the glowing reviews, and couldn't be more pleased. These sit nice at my waist without digging in, and they do not ride up (a major complaint of mine.) I love them so much that I just ordered several more pair. Highly recommend.
B000CGN4ZA|4|I have worn this bra style for years now.  I wear them until the wires inevitably pop through and then I order a new one.  Usually, they last me about a year.  However, the one I just received in March is already falling apart!  The wires are poking through at the chest AND under the arms and the elastic is stretched out.  I have never had this issue before with these bras.  Hope the quality isn't going downhill!
B00END3NKO|1|Ran very small. If it sounds too good to be true I learned it is too good to be true.  Runs small, cheaply made product and difficult to return. They have you keep item and you loose about $12.00 but better than loosing complete price.  We need to stick to products that are not shipped from foreign countries so we can return or exchange.
B000Z44VZG|4|Great, but a little short
B00HQOF77Y|4|Because the shirt was too big. I ordered a medium and it showed medium on the tag but it fit like a large. Also I don't thinks it's true trash talk apparel. It feels scree printed.
B00654MKWG|2|It looks great but it's really thick. It barely fits in my jeans' belt loops. The leather loop that holds the end is also cheap and coming apart.
B001GZUQ9S|4|I bought these to go with a fair halloween costume. They're gorgeous, but drop glitter everywhere! If it weren't for this, they'd be a 5 star.
B003TMLP3W|5|Thank you!
B00N53X0S8|5|Great
B00LVSB6GM|4|My son is 22 months fit him a little loose but that fine cause he can grow into it for a bit.
B00K39W8WQ|1|i feel this pair is not properly made.
B00JQRHQNW|2|No slit in front for urinal  lousy
B00N3RB9E8|5|My daughter loves it. We purchased 10/12 - she currently wears a 7/8 and it still fits, nice and comfy!
B00172SRXC|5|Wow, what a set!  This is the best deal for some really cute, unique, and awesome quality luggage.  I am thoroughly impressed.  I am a little sad that it's made in China, as I don't generally like to support the low cost labor efforts of China, but all the same, it's great luggage.  Definitely recommend.
B00ISYW9WW|5|These are beautiful.
B00K1BBJBW|5|Darling little outfit for granddaughter.  Priced just right.  Color is so pretty.  Should have purchased one also in peach!
B000OB15GS|5|i bougth 38/32 and the size is perfect also it has a littl more space at the waist but that is not a problem because i like to combine jeans with belts. The pockets are large and it comes with zip.
B004IM2AC2|1|well lady's doooooooo not order from this company ever... i received my jeans wich i ordered in a size 17 and i am a 15/16 in skinny jeans when they arived the jeans did not fit i went back and forth with the seller who told me that because the jeans did not fit that it was not thier fault and would not refund me the full price of the jeans only partial (thats a lie because the sizing chart they have ON AMAZON for the jeans is incorrect so be aware) so the rep tells me that I need to purchase a plus size uuummm last time i checked a size 17 is a plus size dduuuhhh... ok so this is the reason i threw the jeans right in the garbage.. i spent $40 something for these jeans and the company wants to give me a PARTIAL refund and I have to pay for the return... WHAT a PARTIAL refund... i remember the days when you bought something it didnt fit u return it and get a bigger size or something else of the same value or a fuuuullllll refund... so because the jeans dont fit its not thier fault and want to send u a partial refund ... so thats $20 somthing dollars they want to refund me LMAO OMG ... By the time i get to the post office and send the jeans back i would have spent more than the refund and even maybe more than the purchase price... what a scam this company is.. They do not know how to make a customer happy... the sizing chart on amazon is wrong so be aware.... oooo and this is the reason they gave to cancel the refund request...  ***Gravity Trading has closed your return request. The reason for the closure of your request is: Customer requested return cancellation  ***Seller comments: Upon being informed he would receive a PARTIAL refund, not FULL, and also that he would be responsible for return shipping, he stated he won't return.  LMAOOOOOOO....ok see how they stated \\"HE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE\\" & \\"HE STATED\\" LMAO im not a man I am a woman as i so told them and they couldnt even get that right... Please do me a favor people dont go thru it urself spare urself the painof loosing out on money in FULL or PARTIALLY and go for the another company this one has no clue on how to handle a customer order that went wrong or how to solve a problem due to thier sizing charts... BUYER BEWARE
B004ARRY62|2|Too small. More like for a size 12. Very disappointed. Wanted a loose fitting sock and this said it was &#34;non-binding&#34; and I took this to mean it was a loose fit.
B00DN138JS|5|Ordered this and was very pleased with it when it arrived.
B00889SWTG|5|Very cute and comfortable dress! My daughter loved it when she saw it online & loved it even more when it arrived and she tried it on!
B00649UZUG|5|The hat was soft and adorable! The newborn baby's parents loved it! I can't wait to see the baby wear it.
B00SZCF9YC|1|Material was not what expected and they did not fit to size
B00FXNJUG4|5|good
B00EXBNMQQ|4|great for price.
B0051PKCSO|4|I can tell that this skirt would be great for dancing, but I am using it for an Ariel cosplay and it is great. The color is a little darker than what is shown online, but still pretty close. Its really comfy. I ordered a medium when I thought I probably needed a small. I was really glad that I ordered the medium though, because the waist is rather snug. Its a nice skirt though, and I would recommend it over many others that I have seen.
B0052T0TS2|2|I bought this belt for 2 reasons,money and skinny. Not your really nice leather but a good-buy, that's the answer I thought it was a good deal and we all know that doesn't work unless your  .  I liked it so much I bought a black one. Well the belt was for some one who  had been on a starve fashion diet for months.  Barely got it around my leg. Said returns were easy paper work included, no paper work, returns extremely difficult.  Bottom line no skinny belts at least from them and the helpline got a new belt because I could not get any help. Diane
B0049MCKFI|5|I used this for after my Csection and it helped me out a lot. Especially for when I had to cough. Its one of those things you either love our hate and I love mine. It is softer than a regular abdominal binder, yet tight enough to support  you while you walk.
B00HVIT5V4|4|My grandson loved it - he likes cars so picked it out.  However, the fabric does not seem as durable as the more expensive  backpacks.
B008XD3BAC|4|a large would have been way too big.  It just fits, but it is a really STYLIN' coat!
B00C6RA24E|4|I love this shirt the fit is good and Imwould definitely buy again.
B00LCRZI02|5|These fit great on my 3 1/2 year old. He's a bit on the small side (31 lbs), so it's tough to find pants that don't sag on him. I just purchased these in a size 4, so I have an extra pair for him to grow into it. And at $12, you really can't beat that price!
B006ODRR3K|5|Awesome Condition, Love it! Glad I got the hats.  I am trying to get a collection of hats. This one fits right up there :).
B009N9N5VA|5|very nice, good quality, a bit small.
B00HVAGX1W|5|Super cute, great quality and weight.
B00J2ULUPS|5|I bought this suit for my son's communion. It was a great fit and really great quality. You can't beat the price either. I'm so happy with my purchase.
B00E0I974S|3|If you're looking for something with Lime Green in it, this is Not what you want to get! The accents on it are a bright neon YELLOW. It's a cute belt for the price, but I needed Lime Green accents as it was for a wedding with that color. I had to use nail polish to try to paint it to make it work.<br />The Yellow ball bead things are hot glued on and it's not a completely clean job, but for the price I'm not really surprised.<br />If I had had the time to send it back and get a different belt, I would have. But because of time restraints I made it work.
B00DF6FWTA|5|The colors are actually brighter than the picture portrays.  They fit well and are comfortable and warm.  This is a recommended purchase.
B00I0QZ5LK|5|Good
B005I34MT4|4|good product at a great price
B00CKIH5OO|5|These socks stay on!  My eight month old is never able to kick these socks off despite crawling, standing, etc.  Love them!
B002JLXKDW|3|The fit of this jean was as described.  What I couldn't tell from the description was where the back pockets would be on the seat of the jean.  The look of the pocket is very different on the model than on a larger size like me.  The pockets on this pair of jeans is too high--too near the waist--and that will make a large backside appear larger.  This is the only reason I returned them.
B00L5YL3NS|3|As expected, little to no support.  Good for a sleep bra or around the house.  Rib cage measures 29.5/30, and this fits nicely but isn't tight.  It is as sheer as the photo shows.  I usually wear a 30E/32DD and cup wise, this one isn't quite big enough.<br /><br />My preferred non-underwire bra is the Wacoal b-smooth seamless, with thick straps and removable foam pads.  Cup wise it is larger and fits very nicely.
B00HZ389M6|5|Arrived promptly - as advertised in quality
B00N8MRZ9G|5|Softer than an angles pubic hair.  Great fit, great durability, will purchase more.
B005BSWXRO|4|predictable useful socks.
B00E5Q1DC4|5|fits as expected- good quality material -hasnt shrunk and not faded as of yet- happy with purchase- my son loves it
B005RDXU7K|5|The color came out great the shirt fit as expected. I plan to buy from them again!
B00HHGGMUW|4|Good shirt for a classic movie.
B00V9F8Z6Q|3|looks a lot better online than in reality.  the fit and the quality was not terrible, but didn't particularly stand out either.  the collar was exceptionally awkward too because of the inside plaid made it very unmanageable.
B00GBCTRN2|5|shipping was great and these calvins are super comfy! might be a little tight at first but ya needa break em in
B00BTX7RIU|5|Gift for my husband, delivery took a while but that's because of how the weather has been lately, leather smells amazing, kinda expected the color to be a bit more brighter than a maroon/burgundy, and description definitely described everything that was included, thank you
B000BI7QL2|1|This broke almost at once when i first got it, it came undone between the belt buckel it has a place which is VERY week and any strain will snap it i HATE i went to walmart much better stuff in ref. to this.
B0046BRKHA|5|This robe is VERY soft and VERY warm, wonderful for snuggling up in during those chilly Minnesota days.  Fit was a bit larger than anticipated but it's not like I'm wearing it shopping so who really cares?!  Am very pleased with it and would definitely order this item again.
B00BJ5CI14|2|not full bang, not wavy. Very curly and not heat friendly even on the lowest setting. Overall this is disappointing. I expected more. But hey its a cheap price what else more should I have expected.
B001T2XZSW|5|I love this shirt.  The fit and quality was exactly as described and it arrived promptly.  The eyes glow in the dark!
B00N0TEIG0|5|Love these!
B00EV5GVEY|5|Just received my vest day 1 in progress fits great delivery was on time as dated product as is..will update with result in 1 weeks progress
B00R0770FE|5|Look good
B00J63E710|4|Fast delivery was appreciated. Daughter likes the style, design and color, and it fits fine. Didn't shrink with washing in warm and line drying.
B00FY7J1GS|3|Fits as described
B00GLQ4300|3|I like the material Allegra K uses for their clothing, but I can never get the sizing right with them.
B00347AFQA|5|I stumbled across a pair of these when I was first in the US 5 years ago. I wish I'd bought 10 pairs! The fabric is thick, good quality and washes really well. They fit snugly and perfectly across my back, which is often a problem... other pants gape. I love them. Amazon, PLEASE start sending things to Australia so I can leave my friend in Brooklyn in peace! :)
B006Z5TXNY|5|I have 3 and 4 year old &#34;twins&#34; (they wear the same size in everything) and those little guys are in love with super heroes.  Who isn't, right?  I was so thrilled to see a Wolverine t-shirt and a Hulk, two of the 4 year old's favorites.  So often it's always Batman, Superman and Spiderman (all of which they also have!) These shirts are soft, easy to wash and perfect for everyday wear.  In my experience they run a tad smaller than what I typically buy my boys so I bought the size 6 and they fit just the way I wanted them to.
B00HW10FT6|5|This is a great shirt--and for the price even better. What can I say other than it is colorful and nicely made.
B00Q6VFV6U|3|Great print, but too short in the length.  I'm 6 feet tall and they just aren't quite long enough.  They need another inch to feel comfortable.  The material is also a little less soft than other lounge pants I have tried. Too bad, really awesome graphics.  If you are less than 6 feet tall then these are for you.  Edit: Takle a pair of scissors and cut them off at the knees and they are the greatest sleeping shorts ever.
B000XMI4W6|3|Every thing was to big but the suit was to small.
B002AIOMWM|3|I purchased this costume for my 6 month-old son for Halloween. It had no lining inside, so the costume was much thinner than it shows in the picture. This also made the velcro snaps dangly and loose when snapped on. The cap was a perfect fit for my son - but he has a very small head compared to other babies. You migh want to get the next size if your baby has a bigger head.
B000WO89LQ|5|Fast Service!  These overalls worked out perfectly for my niece.  She is going into a size 10 girl's clothing so I ordered a 10 and they worked out great.  These are good quality overalls.  We have two pairs in our house already.  They are tough and wash well.
B00CJI9ZIO|3|Does not fit as expected
B007PYDZUQ|4|We love these shirts.  The material is great.  Does not need to be ironed.  Cannot find these shirts readily at as price as great as this.
B00068OF1Q|5|The product was absolutely as advertised and better, great quality and service from frank Bee Uniforms! <br />Thanks and I will shop again!
B000I901ZC|5|My daughter absolutely loves her new cloak. The evergreen color is so vivid and beautiful -- Reminds us of the forest! The quality is top notch and we're really loving the oversized hood and hand slits in the side. She's already wearing it around the house and says it's extremely soft and comfortable. She plans to wear it for costume attire and even riding her horse around in the colder months. :) It's pretty thick and cozy, but probably won't keep you warm in the coldest of temps. She's 5ft 8 and the cloak comes down to her ankles, which is what she wanted. A great buy, especially since cloaks like this are usually a lot more expensive. Very satisfied!
B00N1XP4V8|5|Bought for my son's girlfriend. She loved it. She wore it skiing in Colorado over the holidays. Great Quality.
B00NQDGA4I|5|Great shirt
B005V1J1WQ|5|I bought this for my friend's son and he LOVES it. He just turned 3yr...so the 4t fits him well with a little growing room:)
B00TVGFSKG|1|If you are expecting a leather belt as the description indicates...don't order!!!  It arrived with a clearly indicated mark as &#34;synthetic material&#34;.  I wanted a leather belt but was mislead by the title. VERY Disappointed!!!!
B00NJVKGFQ|2|too small for Large size.
B005V71TVG|4|I think this is the suit every big bellied woman should wear...covers the stomach and lets the cleavage be the focus...just what I needed....I think it looks good..and it's comfortable...although the cups sizes are very small for the size of the suit...The cups are totally overflowing...
B00LNN1ZV6|5|I loved it! Especially the side button and the stretchy fit. Very comfortable.
B00527MAEU|3|These appear to be knee high socks in the picture, but they're more like regular crew socks.
B00NIB3H26|5|Foster child loves when I weasr them
B00XJ42XWM|4|Took a while to get but got it before the date it said I'd get it the outfit is nice fits to size I like it and am happy with it
B000GY6P8G|5|The costume is a good quality, durable material.  When I was shopping for it, I was a little worried that you had to wear it with your right hand stuck in the worm puppet, which I wasn't all that crazy about.  But it turns out, there is a second arm hole.  And if you don't like the worm, you can pull it inside the costume and red material closes behind it to mostly obscure the hole.  So it can easily be worn either way.  This costume looked great on me.  I would not recommend it for anyone much taller than 5' 9&#34;.
B00HEQX97Y|5|Small but very warm. Excited to wear this all winter. Great price!
B007BG9Z66|1|Sizing not accurate, the large is a medium at best. The fabric is very thin and cheap. Not good value for the price.
B009L2YX6A|5|very comfortable..........and love the color!!
B00VRS6L5W|1|Gives no support!
B00NLAK9L6|5|Super Comphy and perfect fit.
B006W09IXC|5|Dress was too big for me. I ordered a 1x according to the size chart. I would have to get it altered by a seamstress. I'm 5'9 and 210 lbs with hips and a 36DDD bust and the fit just wasn't there. Hip area and waist were too big. Not gonna return it though as I'm in love with this dress. Overall absolutely comfortable and good quality. Will buy from this seller again.
B00ATFC9UU|5|Love Grumpy cat, the Tee fit perfect.  Get lots of comments about the kitty. Always satfyed with all purchases fro Amazon.
B00E45HX5W|5|Love the belt
B00DYY2AUW|5|I love this sweatshirt! The opening for the head isn't constricted like some sweatshirts and it's very comfortable. The fabric in this sweatshirt is a little thinner than some other sweatshirts, so in the long run, it might be more prone to wear like getting holes in the elbow areas, but we'll see. Not a complaint though, I personally like the thickness of this one. The hoodie part is sized perfectly. It's loose enough and tall enough that my head fits in without stretching it and I'm able to turn my head both ways still without stretching the fabric which makes driving while wearing the hoodie much better when looking out my back windows. Other sweatshirt hoodie parts were small and restricted my head turning.
B000TMBAGM|5|The shirt showed up on time, and fit's great. This shirt is sold at this store at the town about 20 or so minutes away from my house, but it never had more than just one and it was always a large. I am so happy I found this shirt here
B00EQEEQPQ|3|I ORDERED MY RIGHT SIZE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS STYLE RUNS ON THE SMALLER SIDE.  BUT OTHERWISE, VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR AS PAJAMAS.
B00719X0JG|1|Poorly proportioned.  Cheap fabric
B0000AWM35|5|I got this hat for my husband for this years Christmas gift.  He is very happy with it and the fit!  Thank you for offering this hat~~will recommend it!
B00JQ6418Q|5|Best price out there for Jockeys.
B004QJOD1S|4|These socks were actually thinner than I thought (though I have COLD feet) but they are toasty! Go for it!
B005VZKQ9E|5|I bought this for my husband as he does a lot of traveling.  It arrived on time and was exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Very well made, convenient compartment and zipper for opening.
B00P190NKM|4|Very nice product and fast shipping. Only thing is I found it to be half an inch too tight compared to all other same size shorts I own.
B004P9KJ94|5|This scrub shirt fits perfectly and I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It is very hard for me to find a scrub shirt that fits well because I am in between a L and XL. This XL shirt fit me like a glove and the black panels on the side makes me look slimmer. I love it!
B007C2PZQ8|2|sadly we didn't like it. we prefer side snap style shirt since it's easy to put on and off. However this one soon became very loose on the bottom that it didn't cover my baby's belly. Also, the arms were super tight, which is very weird. Liked the texture though.
B00GS18YZS|4|just what was ordered
B008KCK6BI|5|Fits perfect! Going to order a black one as well!
B00NP0F7BY|3|Cute dress but fit was too small.
B008MA165I|4|Exactly as expected.  Great value
B005GYFVU4|4|The Halloween costume is very nice sad to tell you that it arrived all crunshed up and on sleeve seam ripped but i fixed it
B009KBAWWQ|5|Great hat....my son loves it and it fits very well.  The brim is great for keeping the snow away from his eyes.
B005BVRP9M|5|Beautiful, bright colors! Love the fit. Not too baggy or shapeless. Comfy and many pockets! This top runs short, and even though I am an X-small, I always order a small.
B001D4LQFU|2|These blankets were cheap but not good quality really stiff and rough thinking it would scratch a newborns skin...not using it on my newborn granddaughter maybe when she is older.
B001ANLOQK|5|I have worn Jockey tag-free, V-neck T shirts for a long time. Never had any complaints or concerns. The T-Shirts last for many, many washing cycles. Plan to purchase same  brand again, as long as they stay on the market.
B00HXRUMDI|4|My daughter loves the prints. but the size seems a teeny bit too small. She won't be able to enjoy them for as long as I expected. However the price and the quality are good. I'll probably just buy the next size up to store for the very near future.
B00YBI3BJ4|5|I just got these, I thought they were cute. Once i got them I loved them! the kitties are adorable ! they are so comfy and soft. they are full length and fits great.. Definitely a great buy !!
B006UCQZ10|5|I wore this dress to a dinner with my hubby, I got several compliments on the style. What I love most is how comfortable the dress is. The lace has a little stretch, just enough for dessert.
B004YWSSGI|1|These gloves are no good I only wore them 2 weeks and had large holes in the fingers customers service is awful.
B007PYCRNC|3|It is too long.
B00M3SVV14|1|It's too short worse made dress ever
B00E0XXUVY|5|This was a gift and was exactly as expected. Great design for an Oakley t-shirt.
B00L3A4GP6|5|My daughter loves this shirt and it was long enough to be a tunic
B002JM7Z6O|5|Love this hat!  I don't usually wear this style, but saw it at Boot Barn and bought it. Then ended up losing it the first time I wore it!  :(  So this is the replacement. The fit is great and it provides good coverage, plus it's just adorable with the cute heart charm. Can't wait to wear it again!
B006R1H0I6|5|this is perfect and cute
B003Z6PE20|3|i just like it and it could be a little longer to hold the cards i have beside that i like it
B00KQ4DOOY|5|No complaints
B0007YR9R6|5|This fit's as expected and delivered on time. Thank you.
B00IV3FA7G|5|My friends Mom has been battling breast cancer for awhile now so I got his for her to support her Mom. She loves it! Says its fits great and is very comfortable!
B009H6L8UY|5|bought this for my 15 yr old daughter. Hard to get her to take it off to wash. It has stayed the same size after washing and no fading.
B00E52R0Q6|5|Ohhh my god i just cant tell you how much i love this i literally buy all the color i wear it every day its so comfy and so cool and they ship it in less than week so georgious..
B007CEWAIC|4|Don't buy this is you need it right away.  Don't order this if you need it in a couple weeks...it took almost a month to get it.  Other than that, its a cute hat for a Pokemon fan
B009DKGGBK|5|cute thick made well
B0024V67A0|5|Great patch
B00IX4JWEA|5|I love this skirt I bought it for a Halloween costume and well wear it all the time. its super sweet
B00DNUNG1E|5|10/12 size fit my 8 years daughter. :)<br /><br />Perfect and very warm could be work with -20 to -30 weather
B00KNXFMX4|1|Worst purchase i have ever done on amazon, this is second time purchasing this type of shorts and this large is actually smaller then the medium i got some mths ago.
B00HFKNSBG|4|I like these, but since I wear them almost everyday, they do seem to develop holes at the toes.
B00Q4N4HKQ|5|Good Product
B00HC34A5Y|1|Cute shirt but neck seam came apart after first wash.  I was disappointed I could not wear shirt again. Bummer
B007VDOMZ8|3|how the product feels or fits. I had to get a rufund because my item never came. I tracted my item for 2 weeks and there was no updates on the shipment. I had 3 tracking updates since I payed for the order. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of August 13. I placed the order on the 31st of July. Here it is the 17th and it was supposed to have been here yesterday. I talked to a Live Chat Rep on amazon and they was able to refund me my money since it appears to be lost. Im currently deployed in Afghanistan so this is a major pain in the a**.<br /><br />I only gave it 3 stars because customer service was so understanding.
B005LC95E4|5|I like the pants, its look like the same on the web, and the texture its fresh and confortable, you can uses for any ocassion
B00BWV86GG|3|if you're expecting it to cover you or hold you in place, it doesn't.  Its a very cheaply made suit.
B005VBXSDE|4|This bra is super comfortable and I love the quality. However, I give it 4 stars because the cups seem a bit big compared to my earlier 34B bras and I wasn't expecting that. This could certainly be my own error in thinking that the number portion is more or less your &#34;ribcage&#34; circumference while the cup size, is, ahem, how far one protrudes.
B005TF0A9W|5|Bought so I can change up my earrings to match what I am wearing. Super happy with them, could have to get more colors.
B001L52YHA|4|I got this for a Tropic Thunder cosplay; its nice. lightweight. works well. but its darker and thinner than pictured. other than that its nice
B007C2PZOK|3|no bad
B00009ND7O|4|When I saw these boots I knew I had to have them. I was looking online at UGG boots, but they were out of my price range and so backordered. So I went to my local target to pick up a pair. The size 7 was too small and the 9 too big, but they were out of 8's. So I made my husband take me to the next closest Target. It was definitly worth the trip, they are so comfy. Definitly a new winter staple.
B00BH0Q4LG|5|Very lovely!!!<br />Excelent quality, too softly! My doughter loves it!<br />I should bought more, with diferent kind of princess.<br />I recommend!
B00AKTCR2K|5|The dress arrived on time. Very beautiful material,color and design. The top material is thick and is different than the bottom dress material ( tiger print) which feels like a thin quilt. great quality and looks nice on figure . Different than the ordinary clothes you see.The contrast between the top and bottom is so appealing and attractive.<br />I recommend it highly if you are looking for something different and nice.
B004DS9MBI|2|I don't expect something like this to last for very long. However, after one use it seems to have become stretched out in a weird way. One side is longer than the other. It looked hot on at first. Now it looks strange. I have only held on to it because I have only recently purchased it, but really I need to throw it. I don't plan on wearing it ever again.
B00KYSHJZW|5|I'm a runner so I like a snug fit on my sports bras (read &#34;3 layer duct tape so nothing escapes the laws of gravity&#34;....fit.) I can't have the girls bouncing around when I'm doing 8-10-13 mile runs. This bra is up there with under armour! Wish I would've known abou this bra when I was training for the marathon. Its not very wick resistant as its a poly blend so you will feel your sweat but it doesn't bother me. I prefer good fit over wick resistance. I absolutely love the color selection. Another thing you can't get too much of in the Under Armour brand, either. Overall I would highly recommend this bra for anyone that prefers a good snug fit. I'm a 34-C and ordered a medium. If you prefer more room in your sports bra then go larger.
B005C9G8LO|5|Wearing a pair as I type this, economical, colorful, and comfortable.
B007SOMD3I|5|I purchased the small/medium and it fit great.  I am 5'3&#34; 152# 34D.  The dress is low cut as you can see in pictures but not uncomfortably so, there is plenty of room so that you don't feel like your chest is being smashed. It is somewhat fitted through the torso and hips, definitely something to consider,  but I wore body shape-wear to smooth out those undesirable bulges and it worked well for me.The color is vibrant and beautiful.  The material is full and slightly heavy (not in a bad way) with a pretty lacy edging.  It looks and feels well made.  It hangs nicely. I have had people approach me and comment on how much they liked the dress. I have washed it once by hand and hung dry.  The color bled a bit  (which I expected)  but it still looks amazing.  I will be getting a second one when I can decide on what color to get next.
B002KMJGG0|4|they are very long,,, so I'll have to get them cut to length .. but I like the look and fit..<br />probably buy the black one also....
B001H1ORXM|3|So I bought these because I thought they were tagless, as all the other Hanes have gone this direction.  But these seem to be made in some other country, because when they arrived they had what look like really old plastic-y tags glued in the waistband.  For my son, who loves soft clothes, this is not his preference.  I am giving it 3 stars because for what I paid for, I would have certainly expected them to be the most current version of Hanes, which means tagless.  These are not.
B009T4BJW6|1|its fited tight
B002ZZOP36|4|I received a navy blue shirt instead of the gray that was depicted in the photo when ordering.  However, the navy blue looked rather cool, too, so I decided to keep it.<br />Good quality t-shirt, and the Batman logo is quite vivid.
B00J2TU18G|4|Love these jeans. Can't wait to get more!!
B00LZRW4II|4|Nice product, fast delivery
B00EOIAS1A|4|The dress is really cute. But it's a little bit small. I bought a 12month old size dress for my 6month old baby thinking she'd get to wear it a little bit longer.  Since the size is quite small, the dress fits her perfectly now @ 6months. The sleeve is also quite tight.  So, better buy a slightly bigger one when you wish to purchase this dress.
B00P8ZI8K6|2|Fits too small
B00DGWRM8C|5|This shirt is...awesome!! Lol it fits well and is very soft..I love it....
B008R8WN1Q|5|Great fit and great quality. The fabric is not flimsy at all.
B00F92Q87I|5|Patty ' s pieces are so amazing!  It is such high quality fabric,  I just can't praise this clothing line enough! ♡  And the price you are paying is phenomenal!!!!
B000M18LD0|4|I ordered these shirts to wear as a uniform dress shirt.  The price and the product fit my need very well.  They were also delivered in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  I was very pleased with my transation.
B00337JXSM|4|The first one didn't have slots big enough for credit cards, and I returned it. The second one is fine, though. Thank you.
B009Z3X1HC|4|My son loved this!  The sizing was a bit tricky (was too big but it shrunk after I washed and dried it).
B000TRHGJ2|5|This coat is a nice sharp looking sporty coat.  As mentioned in a previous review, the black coat does have a gray stripe that stops slightly above the elbows, but it still looks cool.      Its warm, great looking, and waterproof fabric is great.  This is a great coat for snowboarding, skiing, or just wearing around the town.  For colder weather, its nice with a sweatshirt underneath too.  The hood doesn't give that much warmth, but its still great to have and be able to tuck away.
B009JXM2IM|5|quality made
B00EIBPPQG|5|Bought too small for my goddaughter. So my sisters hanging on to it for the next baby in the family :) it's a beautifully made Christmas dress can't let it go to waste :)
B0080JVXPY|5|I love this shirt. I will say this light gray shirt fits slightly smaller than others that I purchased but still good enough to work out in. These shirts are thin but not too thin.  I bought 4 and love them so much that I asked for 4 other colors for my birthday. :-)
B00946GMEY|4|These are socks have a variety of colorful pictures and designs which makes them pretty fun for a 3 year old boy. They are a great deal for the price.
B004X639O6|4|Handy, quick on & off, work around the house & garden dress.  Like the free form of the dress and the roomy pockets.  Quite practical and with a little fun sewn into the sleeves and hem.
B00JEXLBA2|5|Love them!  They get a little sweaty inside boots for a whole day, due to fiber content.  I love them though and they're very soft!
B004FZY16A|5|Excellent. Specially keeps your ears covered.
B00AU52WVK|5|I have always had an issue with form fitting workout tank tops constantly rolling up on me, but not this one! It stays in place during my entire workout and the fabric is breathable and comfortable. Definitely one of my best purchases.
B003H2W0NS|5|The Hanes Womens Comfort Soft Waistband Boy Briefs are soft, \\"breathe\\" well and come in a nice spectrum of colors. This was a great introduction to Boys Cut Underwear. I had never purchased them before and intend to buy them again. Hanes definitely does good underwear. Recommended.
B00VX2CXQS|5|This was a great belt!! Got it for the last accessory for a Cruella de Ville pin up I did, and will be used for many things.
B005DN07TS|5|Domo fingerless gloves! He loves them! It was nice to find a gift idea to surprise my son with. They are very soft, fit well and FUN!
B000XRPWU8|3|I had high hopes. Don't we always say that about bras, only to be disappointed again and again? This one has the wide straps for comfort, no underwire and a natural shape. Unfortunately, the extra pieces of fabric sewn to the band and partially into the cups are horribly irritating and scratchy. It also fits as tightly as most without supporting the actual sag unless it digs into the shoulders. Is it just me or do bra designers need to get back to the drawing board entirely?
B002SARWSI|5|I have several tucked away just in case they stop making this bra. It gives me lift and support, and maintains its shape through repeated machine washings. The cups fit perfectly, and most of all, they are sewn, NOT molded. They  keep my breasts separated, looking natural, and are very comfortable. Molded cups don't look natural. So if you want just some thickness to mask your nipples, and still have a  natural looking chest, this is the bra for you!
B00HK50EQI|5|Got with in a week of ordering and are perfect to wear with school skirts. My foot is 9womans but I think its one size fits all
B00DH8NLQ2|5|I love the pockets on leggings. My picky daughter wears them without a fuss so they must be comfortable. Good quality cotton.
B00DS3GLCC|5|I bought this as a gift & I was very satisfied. It's adorable & was packaged nicely. Still had the hangers & everything.
B00B93UV0G|3|It's cute, but I can't make the asymmetric shoulders work. It looks great in other reviewers photos.
B00R8L3FWY|1|This sweater is so cute, that I want to love it. It's awesome seeing Mickey on the front and back, he has a cute quizzical expression, and the sweater has a fashionable acid-washed look that almost convinces me it's okay for a wife and mother to wear a shirt with a cartoon character on it...but.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />This thing will bleed its red dye out, like the Beast's petals fell off his rose. It stained my skin red for DAYS after one wear. And then it lost all color in the wash, until it was an ugly pink-stained bleach white. And ultimately, it ruined itself (and the whites my sweet, sweet Beast put in the wash with it).<br /><br />So, I love you, Mickey. And your quizzical little expression. And this sweater's overall cuteness. But it, in no way, is worth $20 (or even $2). This sweater will seduce you like Ursula the sea witch, then steal your voice - er, stain your sheets. Buyer beware.
B00K6I9LZG|5|Nice
B001PO6MKC|3|The chemise is TO DIE FOR but it sucks majorly that i can't fit my humongous size F breasts in them. I wish they would sell them by breast size and NOT by clothing size.Oh well. Back to the gym i go...
B00P6WGNVW|5|Bought this as a graduation present for my Vet Tech classmate. It was a hit! Great quality shirt and fast delivery!
B00KHNDBN8|5|Fits as expected and well made
B00BYQQYOU|4|The leggings fit as expected, they are just shorter than I thought they would be. I would have liked for them to come to my ankles like in the picture.
B00E3P6T6M|5|High quality shirt.  I was very impressed with the weight of the material; very nice and a great price.  Beautiful colors available, too.
B00PUHLRLE|4|cute
B00D17AYXM|1|Again, when ordering from a foreign company, remember to size up a couple of sizes if the look pictured is what you are going for. The fit was too small.
B003ZFJWQ0|5|I am always a bit skittish about buying stuff like this over the internet, since bras never seem to fit me right unless I try on a ton of them. This fits like a dream. Of course, if worn for a long period of time, it will be uncomfortable, these things always are. I bought it to wear under a bridesmaid dress, and it performed beautifully. And my husband loves it :)
B00IWJI3D2|4|The color looks a lot dimmer than what I received.  The green is more bright and dark apple green color, along with the pants too.  I like the whole outfit.  It is very nice and soft and so far no complaints.
B00IR70SH8|4|These is more pink in the package than what is pictured here, but otherwise these are great.  The bands have a nice amount of stretch, and seem like they would not pinch, or feel too tight when wearing for a long time.  For instance, after 2 hours of wearing our daughter does not have a ring around her head when we take them off, yet they stay in place as long as she doesn't grab them.
B00JUMHS2C|3|Looks better in the picture than in real life.  My husband didn't care for this one.
B00AJ1AUEG|5|Producto excelente, colores Excelentes, y Calidad de Primera, y esta muy bien empacada Para El Envío, llego el Producto EN MUY BUEN ESTADO, un Pesar de La Distancia y El Tiempo de envio, excelente pára Un regalo y un this Muy buen Precio
B004YT4UTU|3|Very cute and fits well,but the green has come off on some parts from sticking to itself. This would be easily fixed by adding tissue paper to the packaging.
B00CEHKPL6|5|Love the colors, love the cut, wish I had it in 30 different colors.  Perfect softness and weight of fabric.
B011ACNJ9U|2|I love these, but they are way smaller than they should be. I ordered 2 sizes larger than I usually wear in leggings, but these still don't fit. They also aren't even long enough! I'm not particularly tall so I'm puzzled by the fit of these. I'll keep them and maybe wear them with boots in the future, but won't be able to wear them on my vacation in a few weeks like I wanted to.<br /><br />These are also made out of weird fabric for leggings. My other leggings are much softer and smoother feeling, stretchier, and hold their shape better. These are kind of rough and don't feel like they would hold their shape very well, and they certainly don't stretch as much as other leggings. These do feel like they would be cooler/breathe better in the summer time, but the sizing is way off.
B00C93U4SO|5|Happy with this bra. Nice colors and size was right on
B00EGSC1TK|5|Fit perfect minus the fact I'm short and had to order an xl but the draw sting bottoms on the legs make them fit great. Or if I was wearing them hunting in summer I could make them capris with the draw sting. Not saying I would my white legs would scare the elk and deer away. Lol
B00HCNBK5C|5|Great support! The best sports bra ever! Love the adjustable straps!
B00284B6M2|5|This bra has been wonderful and I was so surprised at the great job it does!  I had my doubts since every sports bra I've had in the past has been less than adequate.  I am so happy with this and just ran my first 5k wearing this!  Pure comfort and support the whole run!
B002D4YXZY|5|nicely made and so soft!
B00JB68NV2|4|nice but smaller than i thought
B000H22KZO|5|if only the jedi costumes have such great quality as this. I can use this numerous times. the jedi costume is embarrassingly cheap. But this robe is fantasic
B00QJD3D7Y|5|Fit fine, and awesome design, will buy more.
B003WC7B1E|5|This scrub top is very stylish for a scrub.  It's perfect for guys who feel their masculinity is being compromised when wearing scrubs. Be aware that they do run on the large side.  I bought this for my boyfriend and he usually wears a 3x t-shirt, and I'm constantly having to worry about stuff shrinking.  In this case I got him a 3x and it was kind of huge.  Overall,  I would buy another one,  but in a smaller size.
B0067NMXCW|5|Since there's no review yet for this very awesome product, I'd like to write a few words.<br /><br />I bought the tie because I have seen Chad Cherry from The Last Vegas wearing this one or a similar one on stage and I instantly liked the idea of wearing one like that. And this one here is the only one I found actually. The picture looked good enough and on top of that is was pretty cheap. Considering the quality it's a steal.<br /><br />So, when it arrived I was pretty surprised to see that the embroidered anarchy symbol was actually of excellent quality. Didn't expect it to be that good for that low price. Very nice details in that one. The tie itself feels very nice and is not shiny like so many other skinny ties. With that comes a nice side effect which is very important for a tie: after you tie the knot, it actually stays that way because the surface is not slippery. I've had others that I never wore again because the tie would always slip out of shape. Not with this one.<br /><br />This one goes nicely with a black shirt and vest and vastly enhances every rock or punk styled outfit :) Get it while it's still available. I love it.<br /><br />(I'm German, so please forgive me if my English sounds a bit strange sometimes :))
B00MGIOTCO|5|I was going to return this due to the material, but seeing that I have to pay just as much to return decided to keep it. It acutally is a nice shirt to wear after all, glad I kept it.
B00GYTHNKQ|5|Received on time, fit amazingly, beautiful dress. Tons of compliments
B00EPG715C|3|Looks really cute, but it's just a bit too wide across the body. Our son wore it on Halloween night just as an easy costume for a young baby, and it worked just for one night. I wouldn't have him wear it as a real, everyday outfit though.
B00JZNML3C|1|their shipping service ain't s***, this is fake.
B00ATDOS5G|3|When I received it there was a small tear in the seam on the left hip. Wish this would've been in the description, but now I have an expected alteration cost :(
B0037YWVDK|5|I ordered this for my son and it looks really nice on him and is exactly the right size.  Everyone says it makes him look classy.
B003IC7V9U|4|Just what I was looking for! The shirt fit as expected, the hat was tiny and required bobby pins to stay on my head. Upon washing, I was happy to see the shirt did not shrink or bleed colors.
B004D2BB7M|2|so much small
B00CZEO29O|1|Ran very small and it's basically see through its so sheer.
B00HQ73TGM|5|Very Good
B005GVJO0U|2|They were great at first, but I was shocked at how much they shrank in length. At least 3&#34;. Now they are &#34;high water&#34; and look dorky.
B00559VT4M|4|Great pant with good coverage. Fabric is thick, not see through. Sizes run small.
B00HVW9JQG|5|The picture does not do it justice.  It looks so much prettier with the right top.
B00S723UBY|5|A bit big, thought it would shrink more. But it fits fine. I like looser shorts when I run. Great fabric. I love it. Ha ha
B000VW2QJA|4|if these pants were thermal there would be some wool or cotton content. don't wear below 28 degrees wearing jeans over them brrrrr!
B00BP1Q3NG|5|I actually ride a Triumph, and this T-Shirt is of much better quality than anything I've seen at the Triumph shops.  A classic design to showcase a classic brand, and the tiny patch on the sleeve is a nice touch.
B00C7SQESA|5|Just enough embellishment.  Very comfortable and I'm a 22W.
B00MTFKW52|5|Great sweater, have received lots of complements on it!
B009HPBH42|5|excellent product very good quality, excellent material strength in its elaboration, recommend it to anyone who wants to buy it.
B00ADZ1H8G|3|Its a well made t shirt.  The only slight issue I had was the print of Led Zeppelin and the old man are darker than the Amazon image.  It looks as if its been copied from an original and so has got darker.  Since the t shirt is black the image needs to be brightened some way.
B00OKLNQ7O|2|Description don't say it's a slim fit model.
B0085TFQL6|4|This product was great quality and fit great! Our son was happy with the purchase - will purchase additional ones!
B000GF64XQ|4|These are nicely warm and very soft.  Really enjoy them.  Just be sure to check them when they arrive, as my first pair had a hole in them (not surprising given the fabric type).  No issues with my replacement pair.
B00RLNC1SI|5|Great product. Looks like shown on the picture and great price. Highly recommended!
B00K11PZYE|2|too small as the specific size
B00UCO3KS8|5|So comfortable. Love it!
B00MY4ROJA|5|Too cute
B00FXXV77O|5|Looks great! feels pretty good, seems to be pretty well put together.
B004GFK1J0|5|Very nice sweatshirt at a good price!  The sweatshirt is thick and soft.  My daughter likes black hoodies so I knew I couldn't go wrong.  Quick shipping!
B000WO4F6E|5|We used these overalls as a costume in an eleborate New Orleans Mardi Gras Ball. The boys were decorated as TOM and HUCK.  The crowd loved them.
B0000C0Z7W|5|I am not a surfer girl and I love this perfume.  Guys always ask me what I am wearing when I have it on.  It is a really fresh, floral fragrance and I highly recommend it.
B00DYVTXSM|5|Nice jeans nice fit fast shipping.
B00JDMYBQK|1|This was a disaster of a purchase. I ordered the 3x/4x, and the torso was way too short, even with the straps extended fully, and I do not have a long torso. It was impossible to put on without contorting yourself into odd positions, and by the end I didn't feel sexy, just frustrated. The fabric is cheap and scratchy, to boot. Definitely would not recommend, especially for the cost.
B00D0SQNRI|4|The suit is great, but it fits a little bit smaller than i expected.  It works for now, but I will have to buy another one in another month or so to replace it.
B008VONIFQ|1|I have purchased and worn this brand for years.<br />They seem to be no longer available in the stores so I ordered on line.<br />These are not the same quality and very disappointing.<br />I'll be returning these.
B00GMVXWV0|5|As soon as I get the parcel, I immediately destroyed the packaging and tried on this pants and as soon as I wore it, I got a commpliment from the husband right away!<br /><br />Im a medium built, 5'5 weighs 165lbs. I normally fit on Large. But since this is high waisted, I assumed that it can be a little bit uncomfortable if I order just the right size so I ordered XL. It fits somewhat large so I suggest you guys get just your exact size. I didnt bother replacing it with the right size cause it still looks good anyways.<br /><br />I love it! I paired it up with a crop top and Im amazed how It makes me look so flattering.
B007513OUU|5|I bought this to help smooth out my tummy area for my sister-in-law's wedding (I was a bridesmaid) and it did it's job PERFECTLY.  When I went to put them on and I had to work to get them on, I knew this was the right product!  They stayed up all night and didn't slide down, the legs stayed put, and it makes me look fabulous!
B00374LSBG|5|Great skirt. The zipper doesn't lay flat in the back, but maybe with a little ironing...
B004HWF5AM|3|A little long, The legs are too wide also but I have to get the size I order because there is no other option.
B00GD9M6AE|2|Holy cow!!! It is huge!  I wasn't going to pay to have it shipped back to the UK, so I had someone take it in for me.  Seriously if you want a tent order it in your normal size.
B006MGRQJE|5|This is definitely my comfortable, every day shirt. It's fits well and the blue is a gorgeous shade.
B00AMPXWSU|5|My favorite pants!!
B00SMKEJVQ|5|Fast shipping! Fits perfect! This is my 31 month old in 2t!
B00EOYKEEA|4|Exactly what I needed and is affordable.
B007GB8EYK|5|I love it very cute
B0069KH4F4|5|I have at least 3 dresses with open back and it was a pain to wear them. I needed something invisible and at the same time something wich holds good. Backless bra are not good, they are not providing the support. When I put on this body suit I immediatly fell in love with it. I feel myself like I am wearing the ordinary bra and my back is really clear! If you are not going to make love in the restroom of the restaurant it is more than comfortable to wear, put on and put off. But first you will need to adjust it for yourself.  Can't wait to wear it at my vacations in Miami next week.
B00KN6BFPU|4|Cute, but very thin material.
B00HAZAJEA|4|Love the way they fit.  But I am short and they are way too long.  But,  for this price I can get them hemmed .
B00M9YAF5A|4|A little heavy, but all in all pretty sweet.
B004A2XW4U|4|Very Cute.
B00F9A0RSG|2|Ordered it larger and it still did not fit.
B00GY8KP70|5|This dress is sooo hot! It's a little see through, so if you're the modest type, you'll probably want to steer clear of this dress. I'm 5'4&#34; and 107 lbs. This dress hugs the curves and gives way for enough cleavage. Highly recommend this dress!
B0033WWQ04|5|Jacket fits really well and feels really comfortable. I am using it for hiking with my dogs, and surprising to its light weight, it keeps me warm from all of the strong cold winds.<br /><br />Both side pockets have zippers, which is really helpful to keep your valuables secured while enjoying outdoors.
B00HQA3GAS|5|A little long but overall good
B002QYKUDU|5|This Bathrobe is soft, warm and comfortable. It is a Great Robe for the price. Great for this long Canadian Winter. Highly recommended.
B00C3YKWL8|4|Nice pants.
B00KPHTFE0|5|Be careful washing it- shrinks!
B005P4UQ3C|5|good item
B004NNUWDA|4|quality great, re-ordered medium
B008YCTNEA|4|This picture in no way depicts the capris that we received.  The picture is a  lovely sand color....the pants we received were an industrial looking khaki.  Hoping we can find other capris that look a bit more feminine before my granddaughter has to go to the National Junior Leadership Conference.  Outfitting her for the conference is expensive and certainly want to get items that she can wear after the conference is over.  She would never wear these again.
B003YDHF9E|3|Good fit, but a little thinner of material than I was hoping for.
B00GYX4CQA|5|I really like this t-shirt.  The material feels good and it is easy to get on and off.
B00C1EOA7C|5|Arrived on time....loved the pattern....love the fit, very comfortable....I ordered 3 extra to lounge in and in case one is in the laundry.
B00V7JXZU0|1|This dress arrived in a sealed plastic bag. Upon opening it I was hit I. The face with the disgusting smell of I showered bodies. The smell of the worst B.O. ever! All sealed into a little bag! I couldn't try it on. I did note that there were no tags on it.
B0066YKMNY|3|I ordered these for my cousins first day of school. However the expected arrival date was like a month. They didn't take that long and ended up coming after she got home from her first day. A little annoying. If you need these quick then pass on this. They do look nice on her and she said they were comfortable. Not cheap looking or anything. Sizing was accurate. But decide if you can wait that long,
B00374HRWA|5|Exactly what I wanted.  I'm 5'3\\", size 8/9, and the large fits beautifully.  It's stretchy, but not cheaply so - as in, it's completely opaque, but it has little bit of its own slimming power, which makes the whole thing sexy.
B00AARJN0Q|5|I am vertically challenge and this pants just fits right. The petite scrub is what i just needed without the extra cost of getting it hemmed for my height.
B00IAC14TG|5|Great shirt for the price!  Fabric is thick and feels durable, graphic seems to be of good quality.  The fit seems pretty true, I usually take an XL in most cotton T-shirts so that's what I ordered and it fits.  It might be a little narrower in the shoulders than some XL shirts I've seen but it has plenty of length so all in all a great shirt.
B00BQN9BB4|5|Yes, it's thin. As it should be. This is not a legitimate piece of warming outerwear. It's just an accessory. The color is beautiful and I got a size larger than typical because I wanted to make sure it was big enough and it fits me just how I like so I do recommend that if you are like me and wearing this just for modesty to hide your arms in sleeveless tops!
B007FI0GRW|5|Great quality and perfect fit! This was a Christmas present for my 10 year old daughter and she LOVES it. Gotta love it when you get it right :)
B000EZT5I4|5|this product is great for me.
B006PGGJOE|2|I don't like carrying a purse around so I carry my wallet in my pocket. This thing is nice and smooth and slippery. I have to continuously have to check my pocket to make sure it hasn't slipped out. Maybe thieves can't scan your credit cards, they don't have to, just wait till you sit down and then they can pick the wallet up off the floor and have the whole card.
B00LVRMI2E|5|Fits perfect- very comfortable
B004SF82J4|5|we needed colorful wigs for a stage production and the color was bright and looked great on stage would order again.
B001FB4NAG|1|Disappointing Christmas Gift for my wife. Not only did it not arrive on time for Christmas, it was shabbily wrapped. Would not order from this company again. When I complained to Amazon, they claimed \\"ignorance\\", and did not want to take responsibility.    Charles Greenhalgh
B00IZA5WE6|4|Very nice and comfortable, beautiful on .
B00JMXQUW8|4|Very nice for the price,
B001GAP904|5|Seriously, these are the best trousers I have ever worn. Comfortable for days off, but dressy enough for work. They fit perfectly around my waist and seem to be holding up well after many washings. A+ product and the only dress pant I will be buying from now on.
B00EW7VSF8|5|Outstanding product, Fast Shipping, zero problems with order.  Would recommend to all!
B008G55TD4|5|I was looking for a pair of comfortable shorts to replace my really worn out pajama shorts. These shorts go below your knees by a little bit - I am 5'10\\", and can be warm during the summertime, but otherwise they are very good.
B00RK0WZGA|5|This is an awesome prop for photos! I love it!
B00VXXJ3EW|1|the size not perfect
B00NHBS2B8|1|This may be considered &#34;oversized&#34; if you're a pygmy... I wanted a large oversized sweater to wear with leggings, and this doesn't even cover my waist. I even ordered it a size up from what I normally wear, but I assumed the product description of it being oversized would ensure it would be large enough. Keep in mind I'm a mere 5'4&#34;, 115 lbs.<br />In addition to the fact that my dog could fit it, the sweater came with snags and loose threads everywhere. Oh, and I waited a month and a half for shipping. Apparently this thing came from the bowels of China, but I don't see anywhere on the information page where they say it's being delivered by horse and buggy from a foreign country.<br />If I could give this piece of crap zero stars, I would. It went straight into the trash.
B007BSHJZ8|3|Like My Pants Until I Noticed There Was A Sensor Tag On it That Had Ink In It And I Got It All On My Hands Thank God Not Too MUch On My Pants And. I Looked At The Price Tag And There Was What Looked Like A Price Sticker Was Ripped Off Of It.<br /><br />Honesty Would Get You 5 Stars And A Good Review And Also Next Time Take The Damn Sensor Tag Off
B003V4AKJI|1|Fake.This belt is not a 100% leather. I cut a piece of it to make it shorter. It consist of brown tissue substitute,inner layer is leather and black layer is from tannery muffled waste.  Here is photo of it [...]
B00GM23QF6|4|These shorts are well made and they are great quality and a nice style.  I like that the length can be adjusted to make them shorter or longer depending on your preference. I'm 5ft 6in, 125lbs  and the size 26 fit perfectly.
B00AEE7F7S|5|Thick and warm. Love  them.
B00EZUMZ2C|4|This is pretty much what I expected. The tie straps are placed for a slighlty larger build and there are a couple places with fringed  thread coming from seams but that is the worst criticism I can give it. It doesn't have a label that marks it as actual silk but based on the feel of the material and care instructions, all signs indicate it is silk. The image is a very clear repesentation of what you will receive. Measurements in the description are true.<br />The thread count is a little on the low side, but you are getting what you pay for and I wouldn't wear a pajama out doors anyways.
B002K6F7AA|5|I love this Lamaze sleep bra.. have tried others, but this works better because the fabric is much thicker than the other sleep bra i hav used.. plus its convenient for nursing mothers..
B001581U7I|2|I am a true 14 and when I ordered this item,there is no way this was going to fit and yes I ordered the right size, so I returned the item.  When I received the item it stated on my rec't NO RETURNS however, I did return it, explaining that this is not true to size, I couldn't wear it... and never heard back.  SO, BE AWARE order larger than you really want...
B00CJ55N0Q|4|Ordered it in the 0-3 months size.  Loved it, but thought the shirt might be a little too tight around the neck.  Unfortunately, will have to return this, but will order from Rare Editions again.
B00LA53AUG|5|This jacket is pretty good. Really soft. I did order a size 10 in U.S. Thinking its me a medium or large but when it got here it was a XL so it's pretty big and I'm 5'3. As far as shipping I ordered it on the 17 of May and it got here on the 26th. It said it was coming on the 24th of June so that made me a little unsure but it came waaaaaay early. The quality of the jack is really good and I got the wine color and it's really nice. Overall a really good jacket
B00LTMB4JO|3|it's fine but it's small for me.  l choose large even though my size is medium
B000PQMVQK|5|i wear this hat for work everyday very comfortable the material washes nicely by hand so no need to machine wash at all dries to the same fit and will be buying another soon...great product
B00AESPY5E|3|Like the weight , don't like that its not written left to right, it's up and down! Not cool! But art work is great!
B00F36IHO2|5|Hoody fits  as expected  - i ordered the xxl  and at 6' 220 lbs its still has lots of room in it, i may have been able to go a size smaller.<br />The zipper seems to be of quality construction  and the inside is soft enough that the girlfriend seems to enjoy wearing it around the house when cold.<br />  Great spring or fall &#34;jacket&#34;
B00H9YH5EE|4|seller very nice, eager to please and quick to respond to emails. i love the way these fit & the color. wish i hadn't shrunk them in the drier though. they are a little snug but i still wear them.
B00FJQHD7S|5|Very nice fitting long leggings
B00OLJP998|5|Bought this for my granddaughter for next summer so she's not big enough to wear it yet, but it is very cute!
B00ECUHF1G|4|The design is really nice and I can't wait to wear this shirt. I can't currently wear it because it's too small. I normally wear either a L or XL. I ordered an XL based on feedback that sizes run small. The XL is very tight around my chest and shoulders, so I can't really wear this shirt until I lose more weight. They really should allow for more room in the shoulders. Unless you're a scrony person, you'll need maybe 2 sizes larger than normal.
B0018OHNMU|5|just as I thought
B002SQHCEG|5|I like this bra for it's minimizer properties and comfort.  Does provide decent support without underwire and the straps are wider than most.  Looks nice too.  The price is also same or better compared to local stores where it's hit and miss to find it.  I have bought many different style and brands of bras but I seem to keep coming back to this one.  Hope it stays available.
B00SCPD9A8|4|Love it! Its exactly how it's pictured. My packaged arrived on time too. The only flaw about it was there were a good amount of loose threads hanging out that I had to snip off. Keep in mind that the fabric is thin and the sizing is one or two sizes smaller than US so I'd order bigger for a good fit! I'm a Large(US) so I got an XL and it did fit me snug but it's okay. I recommend if you're a medium(US) though to get an XL for that regular amount of loose and baggy feel of a usual hoodie!
B00KFBAIDS|5|This is the second Peanut Buttons outfit I've bought for my son. The first was about a year ago and it was a Lightning Deal.<br /><br />That first outfit is one of my son's favorites. It's soft, warm, and fits his slender frame just right.<br /><br />So I decided to buy him another outfit. This one is a lightweight cotton rather than fleece like the first one I ordered. The cotton is super-soft. The pants are a slim cut and the shirts are standard 5T size. I have no complaints about this set at all. They seem well-made and they fit great.
B00GI6IITA|4|Love this!
B0012DIVAK|1|The case is just okay. The case opens easily -- too easily. The clip is an absolute joke. If you want a phone where you can clip it on your pants forget this because the clip is defective. The clip also blocks the ability to use the camera. If I knew this before I had purchased this item I would have bought something different which is now what I need to do. :(
B00YP0UMQS|5|It was a gift.
B00FGGBEL2|5|Bought these for my boys 13 & 11 years old, they loved them. A bit big for, but function as expected. As with many masks, walking assistance is needed.
B001FOR4SG|5|I find nothing wrong with this belt. Contrary to what others have experienced, it's built well. About the size issue and people saying you should add four inches to your belt size, it's more like 2 inches. So if your waist is 36, order a 38.
B0036GEPGU|3|Works well
B004XFGJFI|5|It's actually the first time I've bought a fleece jacket (I'm in my 30s). Was traveling to Europe in the winter and needed an extra layer under my coat. This worked perfectly! I loved the zippered pockets, which I could put valuables in. I thought I'd get a lot of static shock (a main reason why I never bought a fleece before), but surprisingly didn't. Now, I'm back in Cali and wear it all the time. It's the perfect light jacket that is also super warm. I often pull the collar up to keep my neck warm, thus eliminating the need for a scarf when I don't feel like wearing one.
B00ATB16NK|1|The inseam on the leggings seems to be too long and they dont like to stay up around waist. First time i wore them they ripped in the crotch area. Would not recommend. Poor quality!
B007WA3JRC|3|a lot of reviews of allegra k are really bad. I too think the pics are much better than the actual product. I thought the sleeves (stripe area) was semi-sheer but its not. for the price I can live but hard to tell when you can't zoom in on pic.
B007OTOXS0|5|Very nice pants, and I had to exchange after getting the wrong size and this was done in a timely matter
B005GN38BY|4|Got this as a gift for a roommate and they look great, quality is great bit be careful they are handmade so can be unraveled.
B0037UZC1M|5|I've gotten many compliments about the colors (gradual degrade) of this light-weight, summer scarf.  Adds to any casual dress and also can be uses to dress-down if needed.  Easily packable in one's handbag when inside a concert hall.
B00BIFGNXO|4|This fits exactly as it should for a level 4 (AKA HIGH Impact) sports bra. Those saying it's too small may not be measuring right. Generally, for the band size, you measure under your bust then ADD FIVE inches. So if you measure 34, you wear a 40 (or maybe a 38 but it will be tighter) I'm between 38-40 and based on other reviews got a 40. It fits fine, a 38 probably would too but would be tighter. I generally buy 38DDD/F or 40E, but based on reviews I got a 40F of this...I feel like it could be tighter in the cups so maybe I should have gotten either 38F or a 40E, but this will do. The cups are't as shiny as in the pics (I expected that, they almost look like armor in the picture and I was hoping it'd be less) Overall I really like this. If I buy again I might go a cup size down for better support. I usually wear bras under sports bras though, so the size I got will be fine.  Edit: realized the straps are adjustable. Once I assisted them the whole thing fits better. This is a pretty good bra, still not quite as supportive as I would expect but really good... Again fit is as expected
B00697SNCA|5|My daughter loves this swimming suit.  She loves the heart on front most of all.  The cute little ruffles are a bonus.
B000NJYTVO|5|I usually hate wearing full pantyhose (as in to the waist) because they roll down, they create bulge or \\"muffin top\\", they're uncomfortable, and they always need to be adjusted. These are GREAT (or about as great as it gets for pantyhose in my opinion). I'm not too tall (5'4\\") so they come up all the way to my bra pretty much, and they smooth everything down. You will look like you lost 5-10 lbs. They don't roll down as much and they're good quality (not those cheap pantyhose that easily rip). I bought the barely there and a touch of color - I'm pretty light skinned (not deathly white but with no signs of of a tan or olive toned skin) and the touch of color is just right for everyday use, while the barely there gives me a nice natural tan. I hate when pantyhose are too light and my legs look pale, and I also hate when they're too dark and it just looks bad, so both of these shades are great depending on what you're going for! Hope this helps!
B00525U2V0|2|Too too large.I have one of the same model, same size levi's pants.This one too large and too long.<br />I do not understand how the same size would be such a big gap.
B00ZY9IQWQ|5|[[ASIN:B00ZY9IQWQ Womens Casual Fitted Striped Scoop Neck Sleeveless Racerback Long Maxi Dress]]<br />This dress is awesome.  I just threw on a slip underneath & my flip flops and I was ready to go about my day.  You could easily wear this to the pool, shopping, doing your daily errands, going to a get together, or even throw a belt and some flashy accessories & heels & you're ready for a night on the town.  The racerback is nice as well.  The orange (tangerine lightning) color was cute.  It is made of a quality t-shirt feeling material and was super comfortable to wear.  You could even sleep in it if you would like.  I just wish I would have ordered more in different colors<br />I purchased/received this product in exchange for my honest review. As always all opinions are 100% my own. I would recommend this to a family member or a friend!
B004WI8FZI|5|I have G** & C** products from before...and let me just say WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE! I'm so glad I decided to give Disney a try. They never disappoint on quality!
B00BL9L0LW|1|To small !
B00S31HF7E|3|The bottom of this dress is incredibly flattering, despite the horizontal pleats.  The fabric is thick and lush, and the dress fits close to size.  Unfortunately, the top just looks sloppy, and takes away from the lovely skirt. Another one headed back......
B00H7UDKOO|5|I made sure to check the size chart before ordering and received a PERFECT fit!!! I love this style of swimsuits! Holds in my mommy figure and makes me feel confident and hot...ready for a family day in the water!
B00CIPHKY4|5|Ordered the Pendleton Board Shirt for my husband for Christmas.  Like the style because it can be worn tucked in or out which looks great!  Fit is perfect.  Thank you, Pendleton, for another beautiful shirt!
B00J9B7D6U|5|This is a gift and will not know exact fit until after she tries it on. Love, love the color and the garment seems to be in good condition.
B006D17RYW|5|Great deal on a hat that will stay on and keep my head warm.
B0089G4XWS|5|The shirts are great and they look good after they been washed several times very happy with this product,and will order more in the near future.
B00AWFPBQG|4|The socks do not go as high up the leg, on a size 12, as posted in the photo.
B00HJXLB6I|5|super cute, super comfy!
B00DVNXCL2|5|Very good quality fabric. Awesome design!
B010FCARWS|4|Nice
B0030H60YU|4|These gloves work very well.  I bought them for my husband after Christmas to replace the crappy \\"World's Best Heated Gloves\\" that I got from Hammacher Schlemmer.  These are better made and the battery pack actually fits into its intended pocket.  The only thing I would say is I wish the battery lasted longer.
B006RDROGC|1|they dont wash well
B00486V7WM|5|Beautiful.
B003QOQBOG|5|This shirt is perfectly fitted.  True to size.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice (cool) shirt to play sports in.  I've purchased many in this color.
B00CO2XSBU|5|My grandson loved the bright cheery colors and of course, his favorite characters.
B008H4HVTO|3|These gloves are a little weird fitting; the fingers are abnormally long, so I was pulling down the material all night so that my fingers didn't look freakish. Not sure why the hand/palm fits fine and the fingers are so long.
B003X26SJE|4|Ordered the Brown. Sharp-looking, seems to be well-constructed. Is much lighter than pictured here. It would probably better described as tan or camel.
B000QFGO8Q|5|My three year old kept using my nightgowns to play dress up so I decided to find a fancy one for her. She asks me to wash her &#34;beautiful princess nightgown&#34; all the time. She wears it so much that I've now ordered two more. It's equivelant quality to the Laura Dare stuff that cost so much more.  Whenever one of her friend's has a birthday, the first thing she says is she wants to get them a &#34;beautfiul princess nightgown&#34;. It's very sweet and really does make the girls feel special. It's a breath of fresh air from the Disney gowns!
B00AJJ64J8|2|but durable so gave it 2 stars for that
B0036410AQ|4|1. I am 5ft4 and have to roll up the ankels a bit<br />2. they are pretty thick and warm, but still dressy enough to wear as pants to a nice dinner<br />3. they started off very shiny and smooth, but after maybe 30 washings, got a little worn...
B00553XND8|5|The bra is amazing. I have a large bust (38 F) and take a few high intensity work out classes so a great sports bra is a must. My only call out is that it is a little snug around my rib cage but it doesn't bother me while I exercise. I found it a little irritating if I wore the bra for more than 4-5 hours.
B002SQJQBI|5|Love this dress.  It's comfortable (has pockets!) and the size was right on as compared to what I typically wear.  I wore this for my bridal shower.  It was perfect.  It's easy to clean and take care of too.
B0097AQTQI|5|My brother loves the sweater! It fits well and gets in the Dr. Who mood!
B00NSK63K0|4|I love the long sleeves!
B00E1LAOGE|5|loveeee
B006IX4TLY|2|They are a little long. I bought several pairs and one pair had loose threads right out of the package. The length of seem that was not stitched was around three or four inches. I was surprised such an obvious quality control issue wasn't caught. Carhartt is supposed to be a good name brand. My wife sewed them back but it makes me nervous I will have issues later.
B005PL9ZL4|5|Barney Stinson would be proud.
B002NX0UGQ|2|Got the Large Deluxe version of this shirt in the mail today. Overall everything about this shirt is acceptable (speaking as a very detail oriented, picky person). Ultimately I am returning it due to it being extremely small.  I am 6'3\\" 225lbs and the shirt feels like it belongs on a child. Every other shirt I own is a large so I figured I would be within the range of acceptability but thats unfortunately not the case. So if you are going to get one of these definitely buy a bigger size than you normally would.
B00XBL91HS|5|I love it, can't wait for Memorial Weekend! Love your shirts thanks for the fast shipping
B00J7YYGZK|5|Perfect!!!!!
B00HX9WAFO|5|My baby was 5lbs 7oz at birth, so this is still incredibly large on her, but it's super cute!  It should fit her for a while, and the quality is great, so I don't expect it to get worn out much in the wash.
B00GWZOJ90|3|I ended up  not wearing these at all. They are much shorter in the inseam than I expected. I'm only 5'9&#34;.
B00I8R3EV4|5|Received the package today and it is perfect! It looks just like the picture. The color is spot on. It also came four days before schedule!! Love it. I will definitely be ordering more.
B00IR37SPC|3|Quite disappointed here! I purchased this in the past but with a good fabric, all cotton, no polyester... But This time... Quite a Different story!
B001T8S7N4|5|fit as expected. nice comfy sock.
B00H22NF1U|5|The shopping box is very strong, but small. I would like to be taller. :)
B00LPTCCZQ|4|Love it but don't wash it too much, the writing starts to peel
B00SMABKJK|5|I bought this for my friend and she loved it. Thank you!
B00UU1CSK4|3|Dress was very pretty, but fits very baggy.  I did not think it was flattering.
B00B58TY80|5|My husband loves these shirts... all he now wears. Excellent quality and they hold up in the Construction field.
B00F3DONO8|4|I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED SMALLER SIZE, BUT AM KEEPING IT.
B0001YRWRY|5|does ok thanks
B00ASI7H5A|2|Beautiful colors, but for the price I was expecting something of better quality<br />This dress is overpriced because of the colors
B00U2Z0Q2A|5|Great. Fast delivery
B00XLEVO5C|5|great tie
B00CN7QCPU|5|An excellent suit. Well designed with high quality material. A very good purchase for me. I am sure that I would have paid $500 if I bought it in a store. I recommend it highly.
B007YBDKZK|2|the really clr looks faded
B00MPDJ5HO|1|As soon as I tried it on the buttons fell off. It was a little tight, and it doesn't really look that good on
B0018OQ68M|4|Amazon sends me an email stating my order had left.  After waiting over a week, I contact BEWILD.  Apparently WB wouldn't allow them to release the T-shirts until a certain date although it originally stated that there were plenty in stock. Other than that, no problems.
B00PUM662O|5|Pretty slippers
B00LATYMG8|3|Leg length short is still to long I need 29 in I will have to shorten them
B00BK4ZWU8|5|Absolutely adorable top! Can be dressed up or dressed down. Really cute with jeans. Soft material and super comfy.  My daughter LOVES it!
B00P828O30|5|Wonderful product. Wonderful vendor.
B000ZBMOOO|5|Nice jeans, butt... I ordered size 40&#34; waist but they were pretty tight - more like a 39&#34;. A little incentive to lose some weight!
B0000ZFH1C|3|The quality is not as good as expected.  They had pulls in them right away just by touching them to take out of the package and they bag at the knees.
B000297L3I|5|I bought my husband Metallica concert tickets for his birthday and got this shirt to go with them. He loves it! It is well made and fits him perfectly.
B00I9WKD62|2|I am 5'6&#34; 120 lbs. This dress hit me strangely at the waist...or rather I should say it hit me at the ribs in an uncomfortable way. I also didn't care for the length. I sent it back.
B00RHOIH5M|5|This skirt is really comfortable. I love it so much I bought one for a friend and another color for me! I don't know what I would wear it to, but it was just so comfortable and well worth the price that I had to buy more!
B003EGV290|3|the multicam on this pouch does not match the multicam on all my other pouches and vest, does not hold me pistol real well and very difficult to quickly draw my weapon. slightly disappointed
B00MLEWP9W|5|My husband loved the product
B00I03LMB0|5|Love these super cute and cozy! Seen to be very comfy and easy to get on and off the little one!
B00PUOURRW|3|Only 1 of the 3 tanks was white.  This is a pack of 3 different colors which is fine but I didn't know that from the description.
B002UMJ2TG|5|This pelt is a natural shape which is perfect for making a craft. I noted that the pelt was rather thin, but maybe that is characteristic of rabbit pelts? At any rate, I am still very satisfied because the fur is beautiful; no bare spots. The photo looks slightly gray-ish but the pelt I received is a rich onyx black. I would buy this item again.
B00C3AV8F6|4|Great sports bra that is worth the cost. Fits well and feels supportive. Love that it converts to racer back.
B00CHSEKEA|4|This is just what I wanted for a destination wedding trip we are taking to Mexico. It's very light weight and flowing, not clingy. My only concern is that it is somewhat sheer and I think I need to find a slip that is loose fitting as well; wish me luck! I haven't washed it yet so I'm concerned about previous comments from others that say the colors wash out.
B00CPZ249S|5|Very good shirt
B003Q50TKW|5|I'm glad I took the risk and ordered this sweater even though it only had an average rating of 3. I love it! It fits perfect, is great quality and nice to the touch. Now that I have one myself, I can only figure that the person that rated this a 1 must have purchased a different sweater. This is anything BUT cheap. It's great quality. I actually just came online now to order another one in black, since this is one of those clothing items that you love so much you need to order another one right away before you can't get them any longer.<br /><br />Just had to say. Great purchase.
B00CH4OPYE|4|Love the warmth but the bulk is an issue when washing. Not able to wash in any washer other than a commercial washer as material becomes very heavy with water saturation.
B00BWV78JC|2|I wish companies would keep in mind small breasts women. Don't get if you're under our at a 34A.
B0089IMUOY|3|I bought this mask based on reviews claiming one size fits all, nope. It will fit small to medium faces, but not a long face as I have. The eye holes sit on my upper cheeks and my chin is uncovered. So, now I have a useless mask sitting around. I wish someone would degign masks for us tall guys. Word.
B00LCVXZ8K|3|A little disappointed in this sweater, partly because I don't like how fair isle looks on me as much as I thought I did. Also don't like that the zip neck isn't roomy enough for me to zip all the way up, so it's just for show on me. But it is a comfy sweater.
B00CBTD3H0|5|I have small feet so I wear size small, and I love them.  I usually always blister when walking.  In fact any walk that was more than a quarter mile and my feet would blister.  I had tried so many different socks and these are the only ones that are so comfortable and work perfect!  I want to buy another pack of 4 b/c they are the best deal for their value.  Again I love these socks!
B00NZ4EP04|5|Big fan here
B002G9UEHM|5|Bought it for my husband who is VERY picky about hats and I thought I'd be returning it but he loves it and I love it on him ,,, the best beanie a MAN can ask for very up to date a sexy yep I said it
B001LRPQIC|5|GOOD
B00AMB04W6|5|Exelent!
B007XMQ3HC|2|My son had just turned 8 and could fit into just about any brand's size 8.  This one was very tight around the chest and the arms were way short for an 8.  Great colors and style, but I will not be purchasing Columbia items online anymore due to their variance in sizing.
B002FB8H6Q|5|There are only a relatively few items that we will replace, out of the tens of thousands of items lost in our home, due to its destruction by fire a few months ago; this great hat is one of them. Very glad and grateful that I could still get this -- &#34;last one&#34;, as I remember. Looked terrific on family member and will surprise him w/it (again) at birthday in a few months. So, don't expect any miss-fit/problems...We're going to say &#34;It's perfect!&#34; because the last one sure was. Taupe color, quality just outstanding. Thanks!
B00JQUMTZY|5|I love purses so I thought this was the perfect top for me.  It has all different colors in it so it blends with most anything.  I would recommend it.  I would normally wear a medium but some of the other customers said it ran small so I got the large.  It fits just fine.
B00K8NBFJE|5|Like all BMW gear, it is fantastic. My brother in law loved it!
B00THK6ZXK|4|This has a very nice fit
B0042LZ01W|5|This was a great dress- my daughter used it a beauty contest winner in a parade.<br />She love it and I loved it
B000CNOBXW|5|Great neck strap and one of the better looking ones if you're in IT.  Would buy one again if I needed to.
B00487J6J2|4|am very, very happy with this wallet.  only one concern:  the snap is not robust -- it is even hard to snap ... maybe they figure it's so skinny that a heftier snap is not needed ... but am not returning it ...
B007Z0WU92|5|Am happy
B00L314858|5|Love it I have 2 now and maybe one could come back as a return???
B0058J2E2A|3|I purchased this outfit as it looked cute in the picture and was a great price.  Due to the heat during the mailing time the fabric was stuck together.  Once I got it unstuck and tried it on it was extremely short and tight in the torso.  I am 5'5 so not tall by any means.  The bottom of the shirt was just under my ribs.  I immediately sent it back.
B00JDQF1EW|4|Good scrubs...not too thin or thick
B002R0ECDW|4|I purchased this as Christmas gift for my grandaughter who had an old beatup Quiksilver jacket.  We looked at it online and she decided this was the one she wanted.  It would have been helpful to know the actual length of the jacket.  I thought the jacket would be a little heavier however it is perfect in her eyes.  I enjoy the fact that she likes the frilly girl things but her Quiksilver jacket is her favorite.  It is of good quality and hope it lasts as long as the old did!
B00OROI1VA|5|I love this shirt! I'm 6'8 with long arms and this shirt fit me well. I was initially concerned with the arm length but once I received it and put it on it fit like a charm..
B00AJK3S2I|4|The color is just as seen online, and the material just as nice. Fits closer to the legs than expected, but not to the point of looking like workout stretch pants. if your child is one who does not like for their clothes to touch them, this may not be a good choice for the child, however otherwise, this is really a Great buy.
B00LGMFYTI|4|Nice, I'd like it even better if I weighed what I used to, if I were to buy again I might go with a larger size. This is just because it is clingy. Overall nice shirt and a good price.
B009KY1TYI|5|Great fabric- vibrant colors and good fit.
B0083XI7XI|3|Ok for the price.  Not a shirt you'd have for years but a reasonable price shirt for what it is.
B00TLFLNYC|2|Meh. I saw these on a blogger and thought they'd be cute. I am not a fan. I'm usually a 25-26 and ordered the 26 because that's all they had. And they fit but weren't that boyfriend ish to me at all. The butt part fit so strange. I have a flat butt as it is but it squished it down even more.. I didn't know that was possible..lol. I'm 5'5 115lbs with a short torso and long legs. Maybe it's a better fit for straight torso people?  And if you have a butt good luck! These will make it look as flat as a pancake.
B00J0EXGCQ|5|any time I can find these leggings at this price I buy at least 2 pr for my daughter
B00DN12ZZG|5|My Granddaughter looked beautiful in this dress & her pictures turned out great.
B00QJTTNXG|1|It woould have been great except it had such a bad smell I did not use it for the wedding I was attending. Will be returning....
B00OCRNBOE|5|A great product, superior to any suspenders I have ever owned.
B00LWFEHO2|5|My son love's it.
B00RGGXGWU|5|Love this top bought a small in the black and it fits perfect. It is soft and falls nicely and can also be worn a little off one shoulder for a different look. Will buy another color.
B00OV1NIXA|4|A beautiful dress, perfect for a wedding which is what I bought it for. The jacket is a little large so I chose a different dress. The rest of the dress was perfect so I debated altering the jacket. I found something else for my son's wedding however,so I sent this back.
B00KBQEC5M|5|Dress fit was GREAT!!!! Shipping was fast!!! Overall my daughter was pleased!!!!
B00GB7RQDA|2|i should order 30 other than 28.
B005OFSB7A|5|at 51, I didn't think junior pants would fit my figure, but levis woman's smallest I found were a 2, which fall off. the juniors 3 is a great fit for me!
B0009U6FSW|3|Too large should have ordered 3x
B00L60R5V0|5|Nice and warm for baby over pajamas.
B002M3WNWG|4|was a bit small for a fat guy in a little shirt.  Goes well with satchel.
B007WRLZTE|5|This costume is great!  My daughter is very excited to wear every part of it.  We already had cat/wolf ears, so we didn't need to purchase those (they do not come with the costume).  Everything else about the costume is what you'd expect from a Halloween costume.  Generally I find that costumes run small, so that's why we got the adult large.  The belt is a little large, but easily fixed to fit her.  Also, the price was $20 cheaper here than anywhere else, and I got free shipping.  All in all, very satisfied!
B005D7DZ8E|2|The material is fine...that's about the only good thing I can say. They are cargo pants with the pockets on the leg but don't try to put anything in the pockets are your pants will start sliding. I thought the pants had some elastic along with the string waist but no it doesn't...and the tie just doesn't do it
B0007QMOLU|4|Still looking for a bra with straps where they should be.  Whoever decided to put the straps way over to the outside has never worn a bra.  It is very uncomfortable with the straps sliding off the shoulder continually.
B00274LPT2|5|Fits great,looks great,has a quality feel about it .Very happy with this lid!
B00MHOX4P0|4|I just recieved these today and overall, I am extremely happy with these. They came over a week early which was great. Definitely order a size up (as stated in the description). The only problem was that the button hole was closed up, but I was able to carefully cut a small hole which turned out just fine. The jeans looks great though! They look exactly how I expected and the quality of the material is excellent (all for a fair price).
B00N0PJE4U|5|Get these high recommendation cuz if u like odd future this is the newest in the line and look good i got the matching socks,shirts, and hat its my fav outfit
B00LEEMM52|5|I agree with the above poster, I need this in black too, love it! I wore mines with one of those sticky backless bras, works great!
B00J9TAWO2|5|Amazing wallet and coins never fall out
B00MSEKJJ8|5|good
B00CJQGQAG|4|Item arrived sooner than expected and is very good for the price. My daughter loves it!
B008HQI0RE|5|Hubby loves
B00FSKE7OC|5|well made girls loved it delivery very quick.
B0079XE7NW|1|Order and pay two and sent me only one, I wonder what happened to my other article, because I pay but I sent him. Ordene y pague dos y me enviaron solo uno, me gustaria saber que paso con mi otro articulo, porque lo pague pero no me lo enviaron
B00D3OYK9W|1|I was very disappointed in this product, the padding isn't sewn in so they move around and the lining gets flipped towards the front. I also tried to contact the seller to exchange sizes actually because it was a little too big, and I still haven't gotten a reply and it's been about a month. Don't buy this, look around on this site, and spend a little extra money for something better.
B00JULYW3G|5|They are a great buy! Very durable in the wash and on as well!
B00DGF4CEQ|5|This looks better than I tho't it would, and my husband really likes it.  Even tho' it's not 100% cotton, it looks like it is, but it has a very slight sheen that makes it looks like it has a little silk in it.  I would buy it again.
B00E57W9V2|1|product okay but not for me
B00JQRQ8P4|3|Hubby's usual brand. Too bad I found for way less $ at Marshall's after the fact.
B0018VHH4C|5|Really large, if you´re S you should use XXS or something like that
B00M7UCH2K|5|It looks sharp :)
B002FSXRKA|5|We've been using these glasses, plates, and bowls for about two years with our now-three-year-old twins and we love them. They are in constant use for three meals a day plus snacks and go through the dishwasher almost daily. They look as good now as the day we got them. Many pieces have hit the hardwood floor over the years, both on accident and on very definite purpose from the hands of toddlers. Only one glass has broken in all this time, and that was when I dropped it. It must have hit at just the right angle, and it did shatter. But overall these are sturdy, safe, and attractive, and we are thrilled to have them.
B00E56ZHMQ|5|This is one of my favorite sweaters.  It's light weight enough to wear in fall, and warm enough for winter.
B00DF0TFJY|5|fits great and my granddaughter looks very cute wearing it.  Will definitely buy more of this brand...very affordable and durable.
B00L9C7PS8|4|Great dress. Arrived early. Just had to atler the bottom a little bit.
B003CN0SSG|5|I bougt these to try and I also bought others.  These are the ones i will buy more of. they are warm and they stay up.
B00LLIVQJY|5|It was small at first but you have to lay down to get it on and make it fit and once you wwear it all the time you keep going down to each hook! I made it to the very last one! So yes, it actually works!!
B00HDMWHA4|5|Fun hat to wear, especially if you're a Seahawks' fan :D
B004YXNOJI|5|My Fiance is very excited to be wearing this shirt for our wedding, fits very well and the colors are awesome.
B00F5BX1PU|5|wife loves it, has worn it several times already. likes to show it off to our friends, will be wearing Christmas day.
B0088EYPJM|5|Feels like good quality leather, reasonable size considering card storage space.
B002ANZ1ZE|3|this is a really pretty cover-up, but it's not for short people.  i'm 5'-2&#34; and it hangs down to my knees!
B00A1D0DYY|3|The fit around the waist and legs are great but the support for your junk is really odd.  I guess that's what they call &#34;No show&#34;  It is just weird.
B00FM8FDTI|3|I expected a little better quality for the price.  Be careful - it 'pulls' easily. It's just for fun, not for any time you want to look polished.
B0067NC1BA|1|sized too small
B00841VL2S|5|Item arrived as stated. This bra is amazing. For those that are heavier at the top this is really a great supportive bra and it is very comfortable. Nice straps not to wide and it is very sexy as well.It holds you up and it is really attractive.  If you haven't gotten one you should. I'm going to order more.
B00GBCU18C|5|This feels so nice and soft. Although the size I got was to large for me, I would like it tighter. The return process is made very simple and convinent. Very happy with this purchase.
B00IKCMPGM|5|I read a lot of reviews.  I found this costume to be an excellent value.  The horns were not lopsided and they stood up nicely.<br />The headpiece was made well.  I found the dress being true to size.  I received tons of compliments on this costume.  I was hesitant to purchase it because you can never tell by the photo, but I was pleasantly surprised.  What I wanted to know most were how the horns were constructed.  The head wrap is a sort of &#34;pleather&#34; material (which looks nice) and the horns are stuffed with a pretty sturdy foam material, kind of like a tightly packed stuffed animal.  The mid section of the dress felt large, but paired with a belt, it was perfect!!!
B00PN4YYXW|4|Good quality soft feel
B0007QMP1Y|5|The bra is not only attractive but well-fitting and comfortable to wear.
B006KWRZTG|4|the model showing this makes it look dress length. not so. this is a tunic. that said, it's cute and works well by itself or over a long sleeve tee. quality is acceptable.
B00EO92B2S|5|Love these jeans.  They have stretch in them and fit beautifully.
B000COZ5Y0|3|S. Californian summers are warm and so I was betting on the fabric of this blanket being lightweight and it is! The hood is cute but then when you place the hood on baby's head and attempt to bundle him, the fabric will not quite make the wrap around needed because it's rectangular-shaped instead of square. Also when you put the hood on baby and attempt to bundle, the pretty pattern is only on one side of the blanket and will face inward to the baby so you don't see the pretty pattern on the outside. IMO, it's clearly inside-out and made awkwardly.. So this is my review. I use it now as a cover for his legs when he is out for stroller walks..
B00ESMUF2O|5|Comfortable and unique colors. Everything I was looking for in a work sock.
B002ATQCOC|4|The costume is very cute, and my son loves it, but I am really glad I read the reviewers comments.  Order a size bigger than you think you need!  I ordered a size 4-6 even though my son still fits some 2T clothes, and it fits perfectly.  In fact, it will be too small next year.
B00L6995H8|5|Lovely
B00Q9NH9JM|5|I am wary of ordering dresses from overseas because I know the sizes can run small.  After looking at the pictures of the other people who bought this dress, I decided to give it a try.  It is a cute dress and a good deal for the price.  I wear a 14/16 and got the XXL size and it fits great!
B00SAHHM92|4|no way to keep it on
B00OBOP6K0|4|Seems like a well made coat. Very light and warm. Blocks the wind well.
B008K825JI|5|Great fit, nice material - there's a reason why these are spendy: feels soft yet a sturdy jean.  And can't beat Amazon's prices!  Yes, there is a little &#34;lift&#34; from the material above the butt area, but may work to an advantage to those who want a little &#34;lift&#34;.
B00IB474XI|5|Perfect fit! The fabric is a bit light but not sheer (although I'd wear a nude bra just in case). The scoop neck is flattering without revealing too much and the sides are nicely tailored. This will be a great summer shirt!<br /><br />I'm usually a size 4/6 in shirts (135 lbs, 5'6) and the small fits me fine.
B00MIV5MEI|5|Looks just like picture, looks adorable on my son!
B00FE3YH1G|5|Thanks so much for getting this shirt here so quickly. It is both a really nice quality T and graphic. My daughter loves it!<br /><br />I would recommend this company to anyone.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Cheri
B0093KV0KM|5|It is so comfortable and pretty
B00NUXOOME|5|awesome, thin-ish material but the texture and color make it so you don't notice, and it's a wonderful summer skirt for work!
B002ETVM0C|4|runs large
B00AM170BY|5|The fit is perfect and the color is vibrant.  It worked perfectly for a summer trip to Colorado where the weather changes all the time, so you have to layer your clothes.  This jacket is breathable yet warm when needed.  Somehow they've made a fabric that is Just Right.
B00B5WIT8W|5|I just got this and I love it.  I wear a size 25 jeans and bought a small -- it fits me without pinching.
B00FPQUIH4|3|Although I ordered the size according to the chart, it was a bit too roomy.  It was a size larger than I usually wear, and I should've stuck with that.  The color was almost a charcoal gray, but not dark enough to suit me.  One reviewer said the neckline didn't lay flat, which is true, but I wouldn't expect it to out of a box.  I think it would be fine after washing/steaming.  I didn't like the style on me because the deep vneck seemed to drag down my whole look.  I also noticed that the sleeves, coming down just below the elbow, seemed to curl up and hang out in the elbow crease. They needed to be longer or shorter.
B005XK86C6|5|Exelent
B0036OS6LC|3|has pockets - quality is fair.
B00IT4C27I|5|Love it! Came 3 days early. Great quality! :)
B00GIA27U2|5|Great comfy hoodie. And hilarious
B003AU5WBE|5|Took about 10 days to arrive, but it was worth the wait because it fits very well and it is very comfortable.
B00GD2QNUA|5|These wings are suitable for adults and very nice for the price. If you want to dress them up a bit you could glue some colored glass stones on them or  some other craft product or even just glitter fabric paint would do. They are pretty just the way they are.
B0058N43I4|2|The bra is very flimsy and does not seem to have that much support to it at all. Also this bra was extremely smaller despite ordering the size I've worn for years. I do not recommend this bra for larger breasted women.
B003MW6Z4S|4|Great fit do not bind
B00B79HJCK|5|There are a lot of mixed reviews on these socks. I am not completely sure why. I have worn them several times, washed them just as many times, and they fit great, look great, seem to be holding up in quality just fine, and they were CHEAP. I wear a US 9.5 shoe and these socks fit me perfectly. If you have larger feet, they might be too small. that would be my only warning.
B00BPVIUNM|3|The gift was gratefully received, but a bit undersized.  Recipient is going to try to insert fabric to make it fit, because she loved the words.
B00GN7TUSW|5|Adorable sweater!!  I recently asked for this as a Christmas present and loved it so much, I ordered 2 more in different colors.  I have it in raspberry, grape, and turquoise.  I ordered a Small and found it fit true to size.  It's dancewear, so of course it fits very snugly.  When you hold up the sweater it looks extremely tiny, like doll clothing, but don't worry, it stretches a lot and looks great on!
B00B1FT9IW|5|it fits well, didnt overly shrink in the wash, and it is Alice Cooper..what not to like about it :)
B009ZMBSAU|5|I am thin, and it fit me well:)
B00EUXAEPE|3|I have other Bahama v-necks...probably 10 years old...still worn and in good condition.  These were returned as they were somewhat small, lighter weight....a very tight fit.  I am tall and &#34;slim&#34; and only a slim person could even consider wearing the sweater. I did not think nearly the quality of what I currently have.  Of course this was reflected in the price....i think I paid quite a bit more for older sweaters.
B00EIQTRMY|5|My son loves the hoodie!
B00NNS841I|5|This is sophisticated and beautiful!
B000JJU92Q|5|These are the best I've found.<br />So very comfortable.<br />And affordable.<br />Wash well too.<br />I recommend these highly!<br />Thank you, Bali!
B00BY9DTDQ|5|Perfect for everyday wear. Lose enough to not cling and crisp enough to look good and presentable anywhere. Has survived many wash cycles and still look great.
B00H8ANOBM|5|Great quality and fit!
B0031KDCNI|5|The hoodie is comfortable, warm and is nice and soft. It fits and looks really great. I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking about buying it.
B00817DYUM|5|Colors were great so placed another order
B00B795A6C|5|I ordered the 12-18 month my daughter. She is 16 months but tiny she just over 17lbs and 28&#34; tall. The swimsuit is a bit big on her but that's what expected when I order this size. We have a pool so I wanted to be sure it would last all summer. The quality of the stitching is really good and I'm picky because I sew so that is saying a lot. The bottoms are lined but the top is not. The sleeves are long enough that she doesn't have much exposed skin on her arms which makes re-applying sunscreen easier. The swimsuit came wrapped in cute tissue paper with the companies logos. The package even came early then the quoted time frame. I'm planning on buying another swimsuit from them for next year. I would definitely recommend this swimsuit.
B008DN5HS6|5|I bought this for my husband when we found out I was pregnant... He loved it and till this day (baby is already 5 months old) he still wears it because the fabric is awesome! I would never expect him to like it so much and to be honest when I bought it I was just going for a nice surprise...
B001E6PVSA|5|I needed a Tux quickly after discovering I outgrew my own and I was going on a cruise in one week. The quality matched the one I bought in a local store years ago. I never intended to use the additional items but to my surprise I found the shirt fit nicely and was whiter in color than my origional. All in all this is a great deal at a nice low price.
B00KLI7HZW|5|Bamboo socks are definitely less itchy than normal socks, wish they had the white ones on sale here too.<br />The price is a little bit excessive as well.
B00LLTJHT4|3|Ok
B004FDWXPI|5|I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves Iron Maiden. The design on the front is not for the faint of heart and my husband and his buddies &#34;dig&#34; it! Fits true to size. I have seen no shrinking with washing and drying.
B008RJKGNM|4|I liked the matching set of pajamas and robe, ideal for a two year old.<br />I hope she will learn the nursery rhyme depicted on the pjs.  I have also purchased a book of rhymes with music so she can learn more of them.
B00C20DZPS|2|Is a very nice watch and comes in great condition. Although, when i received it the battery was dead. Had to dish out more money. It was easier to just go to the Michael Kors store simply because i ended up paying the original amount after getting it fixed.
B00EKRKSQK|5|I walk my dog all winter long.  The flannel lining keeps me warm.  They also fit true to size.
B00IN8ZC6S|5|The true size, excellent quality, Tommy, as always, did not disappoint.
B0057HNZ26|5|I got this for my niece, who loves the color orange and Scooby Doo.  She liked it so much she posted a picture of herself on Facebook wearing it!
B004RLU3JG|3|Overall it looks pretty cool. I'm a size 2-4, bought a small and it fit too big. Returning and getting the extra small. I think it's missing some straps for the body suit but I'm not completely sure. For now there are 3 strappy things on each side but nothing for them.. The goggles are also missing but I'm not too worried about them as I have my own set of goggles from a playa/steampunk outfit I have. Loved the skirt with the tail. Again, I think it's a pretty cool outfit but sizes run a little big.
B0002TOZ1Y|2|The logistics of the order were excellent, however, the quality of the socks was less then expected.  The cotton material is very thin.
B00C1KFY2Q|5|Very good quality, It's exactly what it looks like on the web.  Would recommend it to everyone.  I purchased it as a gift and they love it.
B0018P61UO|5|I have a hard time finding jeans that I think look good. These are perfect! I have wide hips, can't wear low-low rise, hate that muffin top thing. These fit perfectly everywhere! I wear a 12 in regular pants and sometimes that doesn't translate into jeans, but it did in these. Usually I am a Gap person for some reason. It sounds strange, but I always wanted Levis and they never worked for me, until this pair. So, I would heartedly recommend them. They don't stretch out the first time you wear them either, which is a definite plus.
B002GJ5IU0|3|this costume is awesome, my almost 3 year old LOVES it. but, i've already ordered a different one, and this one is going back. it's like neon blue. super bright. and the red almost looks faded... great costume, but very disappointed in the color... nothing like captain america :( i will say, i ordered the soft shield to go with it, and i'm glad. he'd be dangerous with a plastic one!!!
B00IHPLJXW|3|its nice for the cost.
B000N8TJO2|5|Saved a couple bucks and the pants came straight to my home, the next day. I will be buying my work pants this way again.
B005KD90Z8|3|these are okay certainly worth the price. a bit bulkier than a regular thermal layer.
B008NZ04PU|5|everything I wanted in a leather sportscoat fit is perfect, style is a classic very satisfied with this product,  5 stars
B00DEMETEO|5|Very flattering and comfortable for kayaking.  I would say true to size.  Looks like new, though I have worn it a lot.
B003NX8C9C|5|good qualtiy
B00JWQLZZC|1|I never received this dress or something similar! i received terrible one shoulder mini dress instead! Not sure what happened but it was ugly dress!
B00GUKD2M2|1|NICE THICK COTTON T SHIRT AND GRAPHICS. I GOT AN XXL FOR A 13 YEAR OLD SIZE 9 AND IT IS WAY TO SMALL.
B0052T0PJK|5|Love it very much. It is very comfortable. But, only three colours. I hope the ligth colour for summer. Also, I have bounion. If there is wider one, that would be great.
B00JTTWBZ0|5|I bought this bikini  the ( blue and pink lace trim ) in every size.... lol and the medium fits perfectly! Iam 5'2  and 115 lbs 34 C chest... This bikini is very well made!!! Can't believe the price!!! I also just ordered the black and pink polka dot string bikini this AM. .. THESE ARE WICKED NICELY made bikinis! !! You couldn't find anything like this @ any store!!! The customer service was excellent! !! I sent the 2 back that didn't fit and received the new one (medium ) in 5 days after exchanging the other 2.... the only issue I was having with the sizing is that it's not a string  bikini. ... (pink/blue lace) there is no give with the bottom so if it doesn't fit you end up with muffin top.....' yuck that looks horrible!  So just beware of that perticular design. ... as I said wicked nice bathing suits!!!!!<br /><br />Eve B
B00P0DQ5WE|4|I ordered the product on July 4th and received it on the 11th. Despite the holiday I felt that the delivery time was fair. I am 5'11 185 and my waist measures 36. based upon the reviews it appeared that the product ran small so I ordered a 4xl .... Way too big I was on the 3 rd row when I buttoned it up. By the way the quality of the cincher is amazing!! I was disappointed when it didn't fit but I now I have the XL which fits the way it should fit... Tight  and on the firt row. I wore it to the gym today and sweated like crazy. This company has super fast deliver and no hassle when I returned the other 2 that didn't fit.
B00AT0SH6K|5|Very nice tie for the price.  Will probably purchase from this seller again.
B005B8J04I|5|If you're looking for a clip that isn't anything fancy this is it. Practical Holds the money nice and snug.
B00CMODDR4|5|I love it, warm and cozy!!
B003N28XQU|5|great belt...!
B00NNFP252|3|Cute but WAY too small!
B00PVESHV4|5|Loved it got it for my boyfriend and he likes it
B0069VFFUE|5|This classic style trench has been a perfect summer coat.  I get compliments on it wherever I go even though it's a basic trench coat. I think it's all in the style of the jacket.  It only has a 2 button front and a rather low cut, but nothing a fun scarf can't fix.  The lining is very luxurious and makes the coat feel high quality as well as super comfortable.
B000NZTPN0|3|Nice quality construction and fabric.  My old Amandas fit perfectly, and these have a large gap in the back of the waist.  Will be fine for winter with a belt and a sweater or fleece over it.
B00BMPQEFC|3|Pros: Makes my figure look great, not uncomfortable, easy to put on.<br />Cons: Buttons on the front are cheap and fall off quickly, excessive length of strings. What am I supposed to do with all the extra?
B00B7QENMC|5|It's a great shirt, soft and extremely comfortable!  Somewhat long on me, but then I am vertically challenged, so for those of average height it would work out perfectly.  Has a subtle heather-grey effect on close inspection, giving it a more vintage look, so don't expect a uniformly solid darkish navy.<br /><br />Has worn well after a couple of washes.  Haven't thrown it in the dryer due to the nature of the print.  Doesn't matter how long it takes to dry, because this t-shirt is fantastic!
B000L2J9QS|5|I ordered 2 flower pins  -- one in pink and one in red.   They were both beautiful and reasonably priced.   They arrived within a few days of the the order --very nicely packaged.  I liked them so much that I plan to order the lavender also.
B00O4BS7BA|3|Lots of wrinkles.
B00CXLG7VK|4|Over all the fit was a little snug, compared to other Panache bra's I already have.  The cups were a tad small, causing a slight rise over the top.  As well as the snug fit around from the band.  Possibly adjust the size you usually wear to one size bigger.
B008D3CCDE|5|I LIKE THIS ARTICLE . IT IS VERY GOOD. I RECOMMENDED A LOT. IT HAS A GOOD PRICE TOO. GOOD LUCK.
B00BQA669M|5|I bought this for my 3 month old. It's adorable, stylish, comfortable, and easy to get on and off. I have lots of cute pictures with her in this outfit!
B00BCH1CLG|4|Definitely more of a summer weight pant. good looking, have had for a couple months now, and have no complaints
B003E7GUZU|5|I have purchased this model in the past.  Good outdoor hat in winter.  Nice quality.
B00EZOAQ92|4|i bought this for a ren. festival i went to. i like most everything about it.<br />pro: light weight, i wore it on a 80 degree day and even wearin mostly black i didn't feel over heated. fit as i had hoped. i did receive compliments on how it looked and for the cost i was glad i did it.<br />con:  the lacing is literally a shoestring and the edge of some of the rings are a bit rough.
B00GS5PXKI|5|Perfect fit.
B005GYGF5Y|5|excelente producto
B00G0L6XF4|3|it looks really nice, however the problem is the size..little too small for me...wouldve been fantastic if it was little bigger
B00IA8KL2Q|5|These are great tanks to wear alone or under blouses, t-shirts, etc.  Wash great and retain their shape!
B007RGMZBW|5|Got it today~ Very cute! Wasn't expecting the bunnies to sparkle, it's a nice touch. As for the fit. It fits really well, loose and comfy, but it looks great. Defiantly a great buy!
B004L5IH14|2|I would say the fabric is excellent but too tight across the bust, great encouragement to diet! Love the shirt, don't love the fit.
B00RZPYFZO|4|I like both pair of pants but they are a bit snugger that I expected.
B00LFARMS2|1|That's not the same hat I got. Ribbon was shorter and brim not as big. Very beat up looking. Has a hole in brim. Rim is a bit tattered. Very disappointed.
B00C2DJ81K|5|Awesome product
B001PS4YAI|5|This is a great t- shirt (I now have three). It is a thick cotton, a great shape and very comfortable to wear. For me it was true to size.
B002QREFOM|4|good deal
B003S2R92E|5|Great quality! very happy with the product even though it was a bit too big but that was my own fault. I was playing it safe but I didn't have to. This product is rather reasonable.
B009CCRK8C|2|I really needed good winter socks that I could wear everyday without getting cold feet. I never know what to really look for. I've heard Merino Wool is supposed to be very good so I gave these a try. In fact, after reading a few really good reviews I decided to go ahead and purchase 2 x 4Pair so it would last all week, why not right? So when I received them I carefully looked for any imperfections as I had read others say they encountered. Out of the 8 pairs that I have, only about 3 (single, not pair) socks had some type of white fuzz sticking out (small, almost unoticeable). At first I didn't think anything of it, however, after the first wear and &#34;Cold Gentle&#34; wash I put them through I noticed a BOATLOAD of white fuzzes everywhere on these socks. Out of the 8 pairs, 11 (single) socks now have white fuzz sticking out, some way more than others. It was baffling to me, I followed the instructions as far as washing was concerned, Cold, Gentle wash then hang 'em up for dry. I'm returning them obviously. Again, like I said in the title, it's a shame, because these were really easy on my feet and warm too.
B00J0SQ926|5|BUENO
B001FOO8C6|5|Love this belt! I also own the silver studded one.
B00EII4R18|4|Very pretty, holds up nicely, but lays a little flat. Wish I bought a fuller flower.
B00DDQX4HO|5|Very nice and soft.  The best part....they stay in place!!!
B003ALSQIE|3|I bought these for a wedding my son was in.  I followed the sizing chart but they were huge.  Now he can probably wear them for another 5 years but still.
B00W4Q4FMW|4|Quality is pretty low (thin fabric). The pattern if very cute. They are comfy, but they do fit small, get one size larger.
B00J682SZ2|5|they  run petite kinda so my son will be grown out of it quick and he is 6 yrs old I got a 7
B00KTPMP72|5|Update:   After having these socks for 1 year i am very happy with the overall fit and durability. I have 3 packs that i have not even open yet as im still using 3 packs from last year. Highly recommend!   They go up to your knees so there is no way they will drag or fall. Holds onto your leg snugly and very comfortable. Dress socks that do not get lose, drag or fall.They can stretch and rip if you have fitted shoes. Happy with socks but not the most durable.
B00IW3UO8A|4|I normally wear a 20-22 top. Due to reviews I went up 2 sizes to the 5x and it is too large but I'll make it work. Super cute. Can't wait to wear it to rockfest!! Gave four stars due to the care instructions of hand wash.
B0029YBPKY|3|This is a nicely made had and of heavy denim, but I think I must have a small head because it fits a bit large and there is no adjustment.
B00IGQU2BC|4|Had to adjust the hem.
B00S4ZNADW|5|Fits great!  Super transaction!!
B00421HIRQ|5|I love these sock. I maybe a guy but the help me imagine that im Oz. I wore them to an exam caught myself clicking my heels.....lol.....but I goy many compliments on social media about them. Im going to order another pair and send them to one of my guy friends.
B0030D2FBG|4|This sweatshirt fit great and looked super cute on my nephew (size 2T fit him great, he's 2.5 years).  I wasn't a big fan of how stiff the Thomas train is (it's sort of a plastic-y material), but he loves Thomas and therefore loved the sweatshirt.
B00551Q2EW|3|The cups don't separate my breasts and I don't like the lift it gives . I found it to be oddly shaped.
B00EVP9CNQ|5|need to make sure to buy a size bigger. that's what i did. washed it once and it fits perfect now.
B002LKE9XQ|5|I have been buying Carhartt outerwear for 20 years, and not once has it let me down. I have an insulated set of coveralls that I bought back in 1995...they mostly sit packed away, but when I have to spend a long time in temperatures well below freeezing I grab them and always remember the spring day I got them on sale in Wisconsin.<br />  Now that Carhartt has a presence on Amazon, I can quickly see what's available in my size (XL-Tall) and in what style. Neither Amazon nor Carhartt have yet to let me down.
B00743WXW4|4|My niece who is 12 years old, wanted this shirt so bad...I thought M was girls size.<br />It doesn't come in girls sizes. It only comes in ladies sizes.<br />I thought \\"Horse Is A Girl's BFF\\" T-Shirt sould come in a \\"girls\\" size.  I did return the<br />shirt for a size S, but it is like a dress on her.
B00AKSCK2I|5|Very nice compression shorts
B003ESRVIY|4|I just got it and tried them on. The review I read talked about getting a size larger so I did . I plan on throwing them in the wash and see if the shrink. I can still wear them but definitely need a belt to keep them up.
B005DPSUK4|5|I have always wanted this style of jeans, and am very happy with my purchase.
B00DM27FDI|3|Wouldn't work for a convention but will work fine to surprise my daughter on her birthday.
B00MGWUKZ0|4|Lightweight but fit is so huge.
B00332FJTE|5|This is what I want for XMAS
B004UULOLU|4|Constructed better than expected for the money
B00EF48Y8M|5|I actually like this scarf more than another more expensive product from another website. Very good for the price, but takes long time to arrive.
B00CIZ3FN4|3|This shirt is made very tight and small if you want it to hang like it does in the photo u better buy a huge one lol I bought a very late size hoping it would be very lose and baggy and it fits very tightly
B000PRCWCM|4|They do magnify your eyes very well, They fit fine. They came quick too! The only problem i had was that they were scratched up when i got them.
B000JIH8WQ|5|These were great bras for use soon after childbirth and for breastfeeding in bed at night. After delivery, my breasts were still quite large and often leaked so I would often put in some breastfeeding pads to keep from leaking all over the bed. The design makes it really easy to get the breast out for feeding and I quickly learned to do it in my sleep whenever the baby needed milk (we co-slept).  After a while (6 months?) when my breasts returned to a more normal (and less alarming I might add) size, I didn't feel the need for a sleep bra anymore. It was just easier to lift up my shirt rather than dealing with a shirt AND sleep bra. Or you can just wear the sleep bra on it's own, personal choice. I think it is well made, I didn't like one made by another brand (dont' remember) which had lace trim. I found the lace trim irritated my skin and uncomfortable.  I ended up buying 3 bras which worked out well.  When I got dirty and was in the wash, I still had another to use and a back-up ready in case wash wasn't done in time for the next bra change.
B0002XSV6A|3|My height is 178cm, but this size is for at least 185cm or 190cm! Too long. I like the material and color, but not the size!
B00FXVJW14|5|I couldn't be more happier with the onesie. I bought the blue and the pink. I only wish there were more colors to choose from. So cute and comfy!
B005CSOS9O|5|I love it
B006E8BTM0|5|The pants I purchased arrived a day earlier then the shipping I selected so that helped me wrap it all in time for Christmas.  The pants were so soft & fluffy both on the inside and out!  I bought them for my sister and she wore them right away.  Great for laying around the house and/or running errands.  Price was great since you get 2 pairs- can't beat that!
B00UVYPHHG|5|This is my second purchase from this seller and the items continue to delight me.
B00GUDHZKY|5|Beautiful color and shape. I get a lot of compliments when I wear this sweater. Nice knit fabric and cozy.
B00O0TOYKE|5|Fit pretty good but we're a tint bit see through around my butt. But still hard to tell. Came in a week and a half and look awsome :) I love them
B00Q78I7CW|5|Beautiful belt, I love it! A little larger than I expected, but still nice :)
B00AJ3805U|4|This wallet totally met my expectations. I had been looking for a death note wallet but I didn't want a bi-fold since I am a lady and have plenty of things to store inside of it. Everything fit nicely and snugly. I really liked the price and it arrived sooner than I had expected.
B00IQTXHUW|5|love this shirt even though was a tad smaller than expected
B00327L9GM|5|I have not seen another one like it.
B008XG4HKC|5|Fit just right. I like it. It's thin cotton. Just what I need for Florida weather.
B00QN8PG8E|3|Wallet itself and chain are fine for what you pay but leather loop snap broke first time I tried to use it. That part is really cheap. Maybe I'll just cut it off, super glue it or put a new one on.
B00O13VBC8|5|Cool hat
B00P8E7VBO|3|I just got this, but unfortunately it still too large I ordered small size. Maybe I am too it is sad:(
B00372UPKI|4|nice
B00NUAY5JY|4|I knocked a star off the rating because the fit is a little short on me, but that's okay because I usually pair with legwarmers.  These feel like sweatpants but fit like leggings.  If you're serious about keeping warm from the waist down, get these!  I ordered two pairs (navy and purple) and might have to go in for two more!  The fleece inside holds up to washing (gentle cold cycle duh) and stays soft, soft, soft without pilling like some other (ugh) fleece-lined tights.  And they look sleek as hell so no one would guess you're actually all bundled up!
B00KWEBFZI|5|Love this! I bought 1 size up just to make sure it would be comfortable and I couldn't be happier. Super comfortable and it works perfectly with so much in my closet.
B000V1K2WO|5|I received this belt buckle in an authentic John Deere package which looked great.  The &#34;hook&#34; part of the is in fact a dull hook, which I actually prefer over the pin with the ball point.  It seems to be a pretty heavy material and the brushed metal looks fantastic.
B00CX92PPE|5|Perfect! Their suspenders and do what they are supposed to do and look great!
B00R4996J6|5|Perfect
B00401R9N6|3|This is only a prop.  If you want to change the function of this prop, you can't.  It's a solid stem, but it looks good on stage anyway.
B00E1AJ2R2|5|Fit perfectly. I am extra curvy and the cinched waist was very flattering. Did not ride, is true to photo length. I debated on going up to plus size but the 16 regular was perfect. Perfect for a night out and perfect with a jacket for event/dinner.
B00HZBMLGS|1|they fit good and look good. the buttons fall off after a few times wearing them. I wish they would not have so many strings fall off them.
B000F3JGG6|4|I read the reviews and order 2 sizes up, sorry to say I have to return this item. I was to large through the torso, but very tight through the legs.(I have heavy legs.) It makes it rather uncomfortable for me. The garment looks and feel of good quality. the sizing seems to be hit and miss.
B0020017V4|4|Pretty flimsy, decent for the price.
B00JSNBK04|1|This was cheap cheap cheap.  I can't say cheap enough.  Worst thing I have ever bought.  It cost more to sent it back than it was worth.  Unless you want something that really looks cheap don't buy this item. I don't even want to give it one star but can't go any lower.
B00TJH9AGU|2|Strange material but not awful.
B007E8EM8M|5|I bought this for a birthday party, it was so much fun, not super high quality, but not meant to be since its just a costume.  Very cute and sexy!
B00CMXZH3S|5|Love, love, love 😍 summer friendly💞 perfect fit, for the modest, professional looking tailored woman who wants that finished look
B00L40XKPW|5|Love these. Fit is great!
B00GFKXL50|5|of very good quality. I would purchase this if I were you. I have the red one and it is awsome
B00ZHGG25Y|5|YAY Oh my goodness gracious this is perfect!  It's a little large, but it's what I was expecting, seeing as I ordered three sizes above my own.  It has good quality, sturdy material and comes with extra patches. The pockets are sewn shut, except a small hole at the top (don't put anything in the pockets, though- you won't get it back. The holes are too small for a hand to fit in and get what you put in it.)  It is very comfortable and worth the money.  GO VIPS!!!
B008VI65SY|5|Fit as expected. Very soft and comfortable.!
B00JSJHQP6|5|Very simple, minimalist, nice finish.
B00GN7Y1DQ|1|Omg, i order size L and usually i wear between S and M.  But it fits for a child that is 10 years old.  I wouldn't buy it again.
B0010ZC7HI|4|I love the design and the quality is terrific it also is cut for your summer tops.
B00TBCARXS|1|The product quality is not good
B0006UH444|3|I was disappointed, the bottom part of the gown was longer and narrower than the ones I had purchased before, the workmanship and quality of the fabric remained excellent, I just live with it, because I love these gowns.
B001PS4Y3A|3|Love everything about these tees except that the boat neck seems to pull too tightly across my chest.
B0011D2FL2|5|Great transaction/product. Thanks
B00PZ6CHCS|5|Nice
B00M0NIK66|4|The sizes are smaller than normal ... I wear a large and had to return it for an XLarge . All in all its OK but it waaaay too expensive . The material is not any different than a regular brand name .
B00KGIQCH6|5|Awesome
B000J9YQPM|5|Awesome fits great.  I own about 10 pairs and wear them for sleep shorts,lounging, and jogging. I would buy again.
B0045PY1FQ|5|PERFECT
B000KLI76S|3|These are great fuzzy white slippers but you can get it on sale for half the price at a discount store. It is definitely not worth paying $38 over! You should use your money for more useful stuff on Amazon such as on sale textbooks.
B00A9Z1JBA|2|Somewhat large
B003IYYEBQ|5|I'm wearing this right now and I love how I can wear it with any of my nursing bras.  It has both a hook to hook onto the bra, or a loop that you can slip over your bra's clips if the hook doesn't work with your particular bra.  I'm definitely going to purchase more in other colors, right now I just have the black and so far I'm loving how easy it is to wear under any top.
B00L5M8KPO|2|The faja is a little big for me even if Is small
B00K680L1O|5|good
B00UW1PMDM|5|Ordered 3 using their chart and comparing size to a shirt I already had and liked how it fit. Got them tried them on and ordered 3 more! Very happy with the quality and fit plan to order a few more soon. Just wish my size wasn't 3XL but that's not their fault..
B00GCPK5N4|5|Really good quality material, nice subtle print. Pleasantly surprised by the longer bottom hem and back zipper. Great value!
B00JQGLDO6|4|Husband LOVED this shirt
B007XD4UBC|4|Very comfortable and fitted. Highly recommended!
B004ZX808W|5|nice deal with you! thanks
B0002TORVW|5|Gold Toe socks are the best!  I didn't expect anything less from these.  My only complaint is my problem, not a problem with the socks.  I am not a tall guy, and I am finding these socks go all the way up to my knees.  Yes, they are advertised as over the calf, but I would like them better if they were just a little shorter.  Again, my problem, not a problem with the socks.
B001F9ST26|1|Too large
B00O8ZPA7Q|1|way smaller than I thought no way that was an American size
B009TB1DTS|5|very nice
B002X09ZZG|5|this was a great buy.  nice quality-color.  got free shipping.  easily 3x the money at the department store.  can't beat it.
B008YR3AAS|2|This dress is beautiful but even though I took my measurements and went by the size chart to order exactly what they said I needed. It was massive! Said I wore a size 14 but the dress was more like an 18. Went to order the next 2 sizes down but they were out of stock. Sending back for a refund.
B007AU3JHE|3|the fit is a little too loose for my 145lbs frame. So far held up well. The red edition wih a different design that I had purchased together fits better and is made by a different vendor for Crazee Wear. Some what pricey for what it is. Expensive shipping too. It all adds up to a very expensive work out tee.
B001TVDIFI|5|Just love the fit. It's comfortable. Does Amazon Prime not cover postage for fashions?
B0027BFEA6|5|My son asked for this jacket. He loves it. Fits perfect.
B00X44O69U|5|I love the way it fits, I need one is white.
B00PLRR90G|5|Good quality.
B009A117N4|5|I gave this to my husband as a gift and he loved this belt so much he bought two more in different colors. Good quality belt and the adjustable feature allows him to adjust as much as is needed.
B00MFEA46O|2|These socks are fine, however the description is completely misleading. I received a package with a male soccer player on the front so these are obviously not women's socks. They also don't fit over the knee. They are typical soccer socks which is fine just not what I ordered. The socks are super thin and the quality is poor. After two washings they almost feel as thin and shapeless as pantyhose.
B00NUICSF4|3|My wife likes them. But they have a very strong odor that we are having trouble removing.
B00F6NQANW|5|Leggings were exactly as described. They are lightweight for summer, but not see through. They are very soft and comfortable, especially the waistband. I bought my usual size and they fit perfectly.
B0085OJUUY|3|This very cute bathing suit and well constructed but is not true to size. After reading other reviews I ordered a sized up. Even with one size larger is still pull tight across my hips. If you have curves this may not be a good suit for you. This prices is excellent just wish it was a little larger.
B00BCK1LZK|5|I have purchased 7 Laurel Burch Purses, Large Totes, or Overnight Bags over the last two weeks.  Three for gifts the other four for myself.  I thought it was time I purchased a 'Coin Purse' to go along with the others.  She is a terrific Artist.  The creative designs and the detail put into each item is amazing!  My Step-Mom gave me the 'Spotted Cats Zip Top Travel Bag' for Christmas 2012.  I have used it as a purse EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE !!!  In fact some of the little beads are starting to come off.  Keep in mind I don't believe her bags are meant to be used every single day.  Plus, think of your own 'Everyday Bag'; what kind shape is it in???  The quality of her products are exquisite.  I love her bags!
B00FFMO7D4|5|Fits well and looks great.  A perfect style for a little boy.  Grandson loves it and doesn't want to wear anything else.
B00JVMC3TE|3|Was disappointed on the way it was shipped. It was folded and creased. I understand that it is a little large but instructions on how to remove crease and bent areas could be very helpful.
B002UWP1XC|5|I love this dress. It is so beautiful. I didnt want a prom looking dress but wanted something special. This dress is that. I love everything about it.
B00BBQNLDA|4|They fit a little small. The material is thinner than what I had expected. Stylish enough to keep in the wardrobe but it will not be among my favorite clothing articles that I'd count on time and time again in making me look awesome.
B002C069M4|5|Very comfortable and warm hat, great value
B005207OHK|2|Looks extremely cheap. Tried stoning it to give it some more life...but it just looks like a cheap bodysuit with stones on it...
B00FK55RFS|5|I think for the price, this is a great deal!  Lightweight and silky describe this scarf well, so I felt like I got what I expected.  Great to throw on with just about anything, more or less casual.  (Medium) Brown color was true to the picture.  I just love wearing this infinity scarf indoors at work during the colder months instead of wearing a sweater, for example...very satisfied.
B00AWB27JO|1|Its ok from the top, but  to small from the bottom.
B00X2B630U|5|I ordered a size larger than my normal size and was glad I did.  Very cute on!  I was expecting the dress to look cheap due to the price and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't.  I received lots of compliments from my co-workers when I wore it to work.
B00PCLHHP8|2|Fabric very thin and cheap material
B0010Z6MSI|1|Not Pleased!!  It's very very small and thin.  It's more like a baby blanket than even a throw blanket.
B0083FXVXW|5|I love it
B00J3KS79O|4|This can't be for adults, it was way way too short, I literally gave them to my two-year old cousin. It's important to thoroughly read the description, instead of merely the title, totally missed the 24-inch measurement, ha!  But these were perfect for my little LiLi, and thicker than the usually kiddie leg warmers I've come across, will definitely buy more for her, which is why I gave it four stars.
B000UVVV8E|4|Plush, soft and comfortable,also thicker than a lot of other costumes (a real need in Michigan!).  Not only did our daughter look cute she stayed warm, got extra candy and lots of compliments!  The wings were somewhat crooked, but she has kept it for play and it has held up well!
B00ABDORYG|5|Dad is happy. Nuff said.
B00KYH9ROE|5|Love love this dress! I am 5&#34;0 and 125lbs fits great!  I saw this dress a week after I order it from Amazon in a boutique store in my downtown. It was going for 58$! It was the same exact style/ fabric too. Great find! I'm happy
B00E5GAOZG|4|This bra provides good support for running. The only thing I don't like is the plastic piece used to adjust the straps. It scratches a bit but generally once I start to sweat I no longer notice it. This is my first sports bra with adjustable straps so perhaps I just need time to adjust to the different feel.
B004ZXHZ42|5|This bra  allows me to still feel sexy while giving me access to nurse! Love it.
B0091E72DE|3|Love this sleeper but the tail ripped soon after wearing it.
B00FY8Y14E|4|Nice head bands...they do run small but thats perfect for me I have a small head 😊
B00FCZDAZA|5|LOVE IT!
B00AK9L9RE|1|I wish i saw the previous review.<br /><br />The quality is very bad ! I wash all my boy cloth before first wear, this already discolored before he get a chance to wear it. I paid 13 for this, and certainly not worth at all !
B0055X1OTS|4|This garment is easy to put on--no hooks.  I like being able to wear my own bra since I pay well to have them fitted.<br />I tried shapers that went just under the bra all around, but they just push the &#34;love handles&#34; up higher.  Since this one<br />goes all the way up the back I get a smooth look, even in clingy fabrics.
B000MR3T5Y|4|The D is actually a C/D = does fit but wish I would have went with the DD, otherwise fits great
B00543ZN5A|5|This is the best all-around jacket I have owned.  it's comfortable and warm.  I've been outside on the New England coast for an entire day with it.  Be warned that they run a little large, this may be due to their customer base being larger than average, or because they anticipate you dressing in layers - whatever.  I'm 6&#34;5, 205) and normally wear an XL and I fit best in a Large Tall with this jacket. You can't go wrong.
B00AQB39AG|4|Being a plus size I hoped it would be a bit roomier but still nice quality.
B001GI1ZPE|3|It was somewhat small and didn't fit as I expected.
B00G4DEFEY|5|LOVE it! Note: if you are between a medium and a large, choose the large...the medium is a snug medium...they made no problem about exchanging the medium for a large though! Good company to do business with, and high quality merchandise! Worth the money!
B005IPKFHA|4|cooling when to warm outside. comfortable. pretty color
B00I9G4BUC|4|Beautiful hat. Color exactly as in picture. I wore it to a Kentucky Derby party and received lots of compliments. I'm petite so I found it to be a little larger than I had hoped.
B007A7KAG0|4|The hat is alright, I suppose. Mine came with a tag that says GIRLS. This could have been a mistake, I thought it would have been more slouchy. I still wear it around, it fits, it's just not as &#34;slouchy&#34; as I would have liked. Not a bad purchase though. It's thin so don't expect it to keep you warm in super cold climates. More of a 30s+ temperature type hat.
B003H7RMK4|5|My daughter loves this shirt!
B00E1YRI42|3|Cute but they smell really really horrible.  My 2 year old refused to wear.  We are letting air out in the garage, hopefully it works.
B00DS5M4Z8|5|This shirt gives a very flattering look to my daughter.  She wears a size 5/6 good but a 7/8 is ok mb somewhat loose. HOwever, this shirt runs small.  So if you want a loose 5/6 buy 7/8.  The colors on this shirt work so nice together.I would totally recommend this shirt but remember to buy a size up.
B00HQ2UILQ|5|Bought this for my daughter, she absolutely loves it!  And it glows in the dark!  Perfect fit, fits true to size.
B001AIXM6U|4|Certainly not the most heavyweight cotton out there, but the logo print is fine and without complaint.
B00MYBDLVI|5|Cute and comfy
B00M8YTS9A|4|It's a little longer than expected. More like a shorts than a boxer
B002MFT1G0|5|Good for summer time~ Easy clear,I bought three pieces of work clothes.
B00EOGGH9O|2|I love the coat but the sizing was too small.  Which it was bigger because I really liked the coat.
B00TZSI816|2|Not like denim at all.  These are okay for working out or some other sporty thing, but don't expect them to be something cute to wear as street clothing.  The fabric is soft, but too much like workout wear.
B0089FPB52|5|I am small on the bottom and large on top, I am a size 5, I got the medium and it fits very well on top and bottom.  Enough coverage up top and not too much on the back bottom.  Can't beat the price...
B008N87W0M|5|My little one loves these footy pj's.  They are a good fit and warm, but not overly tight nor hot.  The feet are not slick, so he can safely run around in them, but they are not so \\"non-skid\\" that they stick to the sheets.  Great purchase.
B008401T9E|5|Great look, great color, great size for even my large head - I plan on getting more colors - great cap!
B00QEDWO88|3|I first ordered a large, because that's what size my friend normally wears.  But when the shirt was delivered to my house, it was much bigger than I expected.  So I ordered a medium, and that was still bigger than I expected.  The sizes are larger than you'd expect them to be, so judging which one to buy is a little difficult.
B00007CNSR|1|Don't order this item if you want it quickly.  I ordered it and waited-ordered 2 day delivery-and 7 days later got a reply by snail mail that the item was not available at present.  Thanks a lot-One day to pack and get ready for cruise and no coverup to pack.  Eddie Bauer-I thought you would do better
B00FEI3GBI|4|Bought this for my husband's Christmas Pub Crawl - lots of laughs and compliments.
B00OOQMY50|5|Great Finish
B00HRUKFHO|5|It was exactly what I wanted
B00DOW5WAE|5|right to the size very comfortable and for double D CUP very reducing look beautifull color,goes along with must of my cloth,very appealing to look at,at least that's what my hobby says!!!!
B00G3KYXQ8|5|So nice and great!!
B0046MAHYM|5|I purchased these for my husband,he loves them,very well  made and great fit,very comfortable.  The colors are rich looking, would buy again.
B00HZT2Z0C|4|Very comfortable and they look very nice. I went by the size guide but they are a little small and snug. Go 1 size up.
B00BOIO70G|5|Very nice quality
B004R1GA1Q|3|Yes the wicking properties are awesome esp for a woman of a certain age. But the pink ones are a true medium and the black was oddly small across the bust. Seems not to be  consistently sized across the board. Just be aware.
B00NXEFG9U|4|Great product loved the design my only problem is the material used for the design had threat already hanging off in some places on the inside of the design, but very comfortable and adorable.
B00MJFHGHO|1|the fabric was inferior. the size was huge.
B00PIAU3OA|5|I love it. Fit as expected I recommend it to my friends.
B0053DA3WE|4|These tights are wonderful. The way it sits on your hip/stomach are is perfect. Other tights slide down or fold over so you're constantly having to pull them up...NOT WITH THESE tights. They stay in place and they're very comfortable. The reason I gave it a 4/5 is because they're not as opaque as I thought they would be. Nonetheless, these tights are still very nice.
B002EB06N4|5|It is a gift
B00K5T6D8E|3|no comments
B00BHOC3FS|5|Just as I expected. Fits true to size. Comfortable.
B002GCO9KC|5|Very Happy with The Hat. Exactly as described, excellent fit. Very well made. Hubby has been wearing it since Christmas Eve!
B00J2HACTG|5|I bought this wallet for my husband and he loved a lot. Simple and just what he need. Very good quality for a nice price. The delivery was very fast. I'm very satisfied.
B001FOR238|5|Finally found the right belt.  This belt is finely crafted leather and looks great with jeans or slacks.  Simply handsome.
B0055X1OB6|4|Love this product! The material is very soft and comfortable.  Thinking about buying another one!  Seems to be high quality and is un-noticable under clothing.
B00IBGWTMW|5|Cool!! It's not too big and it is better than I expected!
B008JRMRXY|5|THIS IS AN AWESOME  MADE LEATHER JACKET. KINDA OF HEAVY. ONLY THING IS THAT ITS FITTED. I'M PERFECTLY FINE WITH IT. IM USUALLY A (XL), BUT IT FITS LIKE (L). SO IF YOUR LOOKING INTO BUYING THIS LOOK INTO IT. OTHER THAN THAT. ITS A GREAT JACKET FOR A SOA FAN. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00OLUSSYA|4|Love this adorable dress, but it is sized very small. My daughter wears 3T, we ordered this in 4T so she could wear it for a while, but it's already too tight. Returning.
B00BQKKVM0|5|It looks as good on as it does in the picrure. It fits comfortably and looks great. Im very happy with my purchase.
B005MQNXE2|4|EDIT, 11/13/14:  added another star because this fabric responds VERY well to fabric softener.  I've washed it maybe 10-12 times(?) since the original review, hoping to shrink it, but found out that the softener, turned the velour into something silky soft, and it does NOT pick up lint now!  So now I love this outfit and sleep in it.  It needs to be lined in winter with leggings (or their yoga bootcut pants which 'berry' match the 'magenta' here).  Else, the polyester against the skin feels clammy.<br /><br />The fabric softener effect, is unique versus the other similar jog suits I have also from the same company: I have their priciest zip sets, too.  Their more-expensive sets pick up lint like a magnet, and are not responding to softener, so the velour is rougher.  But not here.<br /><br />So now I'm a happier camper.  Still, the 'way overpriced' moniker applies to both this set and all the other ones they sell (though the other ones are thicker, better quality, and cut closer to the body).  Don't pay more than $20, and order a size or two down if you want the fit to be like the picture (i.e., their S=size 12-14, which is an L in a 'normal' online department store, like Nordstrom's or Saks).<br /><br />EDIT, 10/10/14:  added one star because it washes and dries well, even if wash warm casual cycle and tumble dry HIGH cotton.  No wrinkling, wearable right from the dryer, and no immediate pilling.  It's 100% polyester, so won't shrink.  The magenta is the cheapest-looking of the colors, in person (more like a cheap-motel version of dusty rose).  But they are comfortable.  Order your true size, bearing in mind that their 'small' is anyone else's large (size 12 to 14, elsewhere) or medium (size 14 to 16, elsewhere), deliberately oversized.<br /><br />Note: their other jogging suits are better quality: this is the Motel 6 version.  I also got the one with the ghastly rosettes (planning to remove them), and the velour is 10x better.  But still, not worth more than $20 per suit.  So shop around BCO OSP direct, see if the color and size you want might be offered at a lower price.  Original review, follows below.<br />==========<br />Okay, the positives:<br /><br />1.  Colors are as pictured.<br />2.  These jogging suits are comfortable.<br />3.  Yes, the velvet is shiny (if you're into that sort of thing).<br /><br />But<br /><br />4.  the 'velvet' is more like velveteen, quite thin.<br />5.  Top is boxy, not flared.<br />6.  Material is scratchy, but washing will soften it.  Usually these things are made outside the US, and the finishing chemicals used are smelly or rough.direct, see if the color and size you want might be offered at a lower price.

B00WKI3NRM|3|I loved the color but the gown was at least 2 sizes smaller than normal that size. I did order a size larger than needed.
B00H69OTIM|5|These are great. At least twice as thick as the flimsy ones that have been in shirts lately. They hold collars nice and straight. And I love the range of sizes. Totally worth the price.
B00CO961EE|1|Collects everything to the pants. After washing them twice I couldn't wear them out.
B00J3PWJXO|5|They are so cute and soft.
B008X0E672|3|I'm 5'1\\" tall and this is still not as long on me as what is pictured here. The model is supposedly two inches taller, but that's a lie. It's still cute and a good deal, so I will keep it.
B00UV9ZEH4|3|so I paid very careful attention to the non-american sizing and even then, the size I was weird. The top bit was waaaay too loose and the bottom too tight. The back straps do NOT stay flat. That aside, the dress is nice, well made, and cute, I'm currently workin on losing some lbs so hopefully it will fit after that but be careful of the sizing because even if you follow the measurements the seller provided it still might not fit
B000TUTDBS|2|I've been checking this bag out online since August, but it was not available for purchase until October 12th.  After two months of waiting in anticipation (okay I'm being dramatic) I purchased this bag for my hubby.  The pockets are great, the interior space is great, but here's where it falls apart...the strap is HORRIBLY made.  My hubby's chest is about 42 inches wide, so when he wears the bag with his winter coat, it barely holds together.  The most annoying part is the fact that the strap is secured primarily with velcro, which in my opinion, is very limiting when it needs to be adjusted.
B00EXOO5TQ|5|I love it. Very comfy.
B00H3X4QQG|3|great for the price but plastic around the edges started to peal. Still usable though
B00BNSG68I|5|This is great quality and runs true to size.  I wore mine with a lace skirt and pearls to a wedding reception.  It was prettier in person than the picture.  Wear it to dress up or down..very cute!
B00QXAHBCQ|4|It's adorable, the colors are bright, and the quality is good.
B00GM3S466|4|This product was delivered as promised and was as described .
B00II9DB1A|1|Color is absolutely different then on picture<br />Size is bigger .Nothing special for this money.<br />Would not order again
B00F98THL6|5|A little bit big... but I have worn them for years and I love them!!!!!
B00CRQRV70|4|its the right size but doesnt cover my rear like a dress should. but thats ok i have black leggings i can wear. i love it though
B00SN2PWSW|5|Got lots of compliments on this.  Very cute.
B00GSN9HZC|1|I ordered a large and it said large . I want to know who was the model for this one. I gave it away to a friend that is a size 5 and it was still to small for her. It went to good will waste of my money. And to send it back would of cost me more then the top.
B00802QQJ4|4|Socks were great! They were somewhat tight but overall felt comfortable
B0089M5PF6|1|EDIT:  I've figured out how to fix the 'cowl'.  For its neckline plunges so low, that if you bend over, one can easily see your bra.  The solution is to pin part of the neckline UNDER the bra, or else tuck it far down INTO the (black!) bra, so that if you bend over, the neckline won't reveal the bra.  This can be done without ruining the line of the shirt, and without ruining the cowl neckline.<br /><br />The above should work even better, if you wear those shoulder pads you can affix to your bra straps.  Thus the entire neckline would be higher, to begin with.  Pity someone at Ulla Popken didn't test this shirt 'in the wild' prior to selling it, as this problem ought to be common, and should have been noticed even by the woman in the picture.<br /><br />Original review, follows below.<br /><br />==========<br /><br />Picture and description are totally misleading.  This is a VERY thin (see-through!) long jersey t-shirt, with the weirdest neckline; it won't lay rightly, so it plunges far more than the picture would indicate.  So you'll need a matching nylon slip; as the low-cut, clingy style will likely reveal your bra.  Worse, if you order this in your proper size, it will be too tight across the bust, owing to the neckline.  So it presents a most unflattering profile (sideways).  If you order a size larger than you wear, the neckline droops down even more. At best, you'd use it as a lounger, or maybe as a cover-up on the beach.  Maybe worth $5, for that.<br /><br />The arms fit tightly.  They don't chafe, but that style for the arms, clashes with the rest of the tunic.<br /><br />I bought the black one.  So the sheerness has yet some value, as it's acceptable for black to be sheer.  Even so, it hangs badly due to the neckline, and I'm not sure how to fix it.  Could pin the drooping neckline sideways and upwards, on my right shoulder.<br /><br />It does not travel well, arrived horribly wrinkled, though 100% rayon.  I squirted it to death with water, and after hanging for some hours, most wrinkles came out, excepting around that 'collar'.<br /><br />So it's way overpriced.  Shipping alone cost two weeks' wait and $11; will cost another $8 to return!  (Warning: DO use their own return shipping label.  If instead you use Amazon's to pay shipping yourself, you are still charged AGAIN for the shipping label cost, as a 'restocking' fee.  Amazon can't help you with this.)  Oh, I did buy one other thing in the order, the striped cowl neck shirt of similar design (see my review of same date), which at least was a tad playful and made of maybe 5 oz (weight) cotton.  But still with the goofy neckline, far larger than the picture shows.<br /><br />This was my first and last order with Ulla Popken.  What is it with these plus-size companies, who make shoddy clothing that is WAY overpriced, for the quality you get?

B000I2FLEU|5|Great for big guys doin' drag!
B00416CB0Q|5|I purchased these for my husband and he loves them. They keep his feet warmer than any other socks he has. Very good quality socks.
B002N34S0U|4|The ghost set is a great addition to my graveyard scene on Halloween.  I received many complements and a few people wanted to know how I made them!  (I told them I bought the set).<br />TIP:  One issue is the included plastic lawn spikes are not strong enough to hold the ghosts up (especially if the fabric becomes heavy from wet weather).  Easy fix!  The posts are hollow and I cut wood dowel rods from a hardware store, put the dowels in the ground instead of the included spikes, then slid the posts over the dowels and solved the problem easily.
B00MQ4W59M|2|The pajamas were fine--well made; however they were about a size 3 T rather than a 5.  Had to return them.
B00IZT7MZ4|5|Love them!
B00NKWH3NM|4|Excellent quality! Love the style! Unfortunately it was too small I ordered a 3x large Asian I would say with confidence it was US LARGE NOT US EX LARGR. But it looks nice on my friend who loves it. No 4x available.
B00742VS5I|1|They are big enough to fit an adult.  My daughter is 2 and a half and there are for a sumo baby. I ordered 2t and reordered 12 month ones and they are still to big. I don't have a tiny child either
B001CEIR0I|5|Pretty cool hat, 2 year old loved it and wouldn't take it off, fit him perfect. Only thing I wasn't expecting is that it is a trucker hat.
B009YX70R0|5|Good quality shirt from Tommy.I really was not expecting any thing less.I love the color too .I RECOMMEND THIS SHIRT
B001G7R0FE|4|It's just what it says it is: a stretch woven belt. Nothing fancy or dressy, just utilitarian. The color isn't khaki, though, it's much more yellowish.
B00CSIBXTO|4|These were purchased as a gift fit great . and comfortable and perfect fit .  I would purchase again great find.
B0058ZWFTQ|4|Very nice and fits well. The tissue is very nice and the size is very good compared to other brands.
B00K5N1WC2|3|you were smaller than I thought.
B00M814DC0|5|nice like it
B001N4T5C6|5|Delivery was ahead of schedule. The hat fits perfect, the lining is warm and I am happy with my new &#34;Grumpy Old Men&#34;.
B00OAS0M2E|5|Beautiful!
B00631VEBO|1|I would not order from this vendor again.  Very strange proportions.
B004IODZYW|4|These panties are fine and fit very well.
B00381AJ4K|5|Good quality, packed nicely, arrived promptly.  The blazer fits me almost perfectly and looks very stylish and professional.  A good buy for the money.
B00LKXSLGG|5|Beautiful.....love it!
B00GBPUUAI|1|Material was lovely... But WAY to small... Not for american size 12 or 14
B00IUV21U8|5|so comfy
B001E5VT0U|2|the mustache has a wire in it so it didnt fit my face at all, but i am a woman with a smaller face. maybe a childs beard wouldve worked better. wig was pretty frizzy.
B008G7NNTY|5|This jacket is very nice. I love the way they did the cuffs, my arms stay very warm, and the inside is lined with a nice material that keeps me warm in the Wisconsin cold. I'm 6'5&#34;, so the 3X Tall was a plus. I finally found a piece of clothing that fits my long torso well. Other jackets would sit at my waist and I don't find that very comfortable, this one comes down a few inches passed my waist line. Although I haven't owned very many winter coats in my life(I wear jean shorts in the winter), this coat is easily the best one i've ever had. If you're looking for something warm and comfortable that fits nicely, this coat is for you.
B00II6ZQ5C|3|This dress is lovely, and since I checked the reviews, I ordered the right size. However, when I laundered it, following the instructions on the labels, the front overskirt pulled away from the waist seam, leaving huge rips in the fragile fabric. The dress is unwearable as it is and I do not know if I can repair it. My recommendation is that if you order this dress, be prepared to hand wash it.
B00IUC19JQ|3|It was cute and warm but too big for a newborn.
B00HR0NK1C|1|Not happy. Feels kinda cheap. I would like to return
B00DP6BH8U|5|Great costume for the price. Super cute on. Does run a little small so order on the side of caution if they are On the bigger side of the sizes
B002QYMCVI|5|This is a very nice robe.
B00JM04LHW|3|I like the material but the cut was way smaller than I expected. I wish I could get both replaced with one size bigger.
B0043O8O0C|3|I have hunted the world over for pants for my string bean son - slims get hard to find as they get taller and taller.  These are regular, slim fitting pants, too small for my slim sized son.  They have to go back!  Sadly, the true to size pants are all coming from the high end stores - and I hate that!
B002AFMDD0|5|This was a huge hit for the first birthday girl.  Fit great and even the birthday girl enjoyed wearing it.
B00HJZL7DS|5|I have been using a squeem for a while, I have tried other brands. By far this is my favorite and I have been getting great results in keeping my waist tighter.
B00HF4NCE0|5|The fabric feels nice and I love this scarf. It looks great on!
B00IZYVFO8|3|Good pants - fit too big
B00936SISI|5|Very happy with my caps!!
B000Z9W33S|3|Looked better in the pictures then in person
