B003YD3O7G|4|If you are travelling long distance these are a must. I used them with bose in ear headphones. However, if you're going short distance or making frequent stops, it's a pain to put your headphone in. I did miss my other version where the speakers are inside the helmet
B00S1Z7Q1C|5|Perfect Gauges for my air regulator/ filter.
B00009PGNS|1|Motor burnt up after 10 days of use. Waste of money.
B002TIGPL4|5|Hasn't peeled even the slightest in the few years I've had it
B00OPZ3HGU|3|The antenna doesn't reach  far I have to open the hood to change the colors with the remote close to the antenna<br /><br />And  the connections become lose and one ring changes a diffrent  color  compared to the rest  because bad loose connector<br />other than that it's good for what it's selling for  very bright colors
B002MWNT84|5|The cover goes right into place and works great.
B00ZOKJVAG|3|The pros: 3 decent sized shades, very quick and simple application, great price<br />The con: not much shade<br />I don't have anything to compare these to so for all I know they could be the standard tint, however after putting these on my already tinted windows I didn't see much of a difference. The sun still managed to blind my son. I will update my review after I try a different brand.
B008Z8W5XY|4|A good car ashtray...fits nicely in the cup holder...the lid closes to smother the residual smoke...only complaint is I wish it was slightly taller
B00K691GUS|5|Pressure switch 28610-RAY-003 28610-RAY-013 resolved the MIL issue and flashing &#34;D&#34; in my 2003 Honda CRV. It has been over 500 miles since the replacement and malfunction light has not come back. Also, I have not seen the flashing D since the replacement.
B000BZJ9Q0|5|Fit perfect and solved all my running rich problems.
B000GTU4VU|5|as described, received in excellent time
B008ZNNFZG|5|I like the old skool hippie design of this one. Easy install and it looks good. I'm hoping that while I'm out on the highways and bi-ways, someone about to have a fit of &#34;road rage&#34; will see it, and have a change of heart ...
B00S68NNVG|4|Look great and work as advertised.  The installation was challenging.  On my M5 removing the air boxes really helped, it should be the first thing you do after opening the hood.  Polishing the Lenses (Mother's NuLens) really enhanced the overall effect of the installation.  New fog lamps further added a dose of 'bitchin'.  The whole outcome was well worth the price.  One thing though, the plastic notch tabs needed to be filed slightly to fit in the light assembly.
B0073W399C|5|excellent product, does all it clains

B000CEZU36|5|Perfect fit for 2002 volvo s60. so far works with no leaks like the old one...Do it yourself and save over 800.00 bucks.....You can do it....

B00380FSL0|4|******Attention Toyota Tundra and Sequoia Owners******<br />After install of the K&N Cold air intake and filter (2008 Toyota Sequoia Limited 5.7L V8) a loud whistling sound has been coming from the engine at low R.P.M.s, and when you just begin to step on the accelerator.  After extensive research and hours on discussion boards I have learned that the whistling sound is caused from the throttle body gasket's built-in screen.  The recommended solution is to cut the screen out, and apparently the whistling sound will go away???  Since my engine is old I will have to order a new gasket and remove the mettle screen (cost of gasket is around $20), and install a new gasket.  No big deal it has just wasted hours of my time searching for an air leak in the system, none, and researching<br />&#34;On The Line&#34;  looking for a solution.

B009DK09ZY|5|Good quality replacement part and easy to install. I do recommend heating up the mounting bolts prior to removal of old part.  This fit my 01' GMC Sonoma perfectly.

B004R900GO|1|This engine stand says 1500lbs capacity. BS. I purchased it for a cummins engine rebuild project I have. The stripped long block is enough to bend this thing. It is not stable. I utilized grade 8 bolts as the included ones are not strong at all. If you want s solid engine stand for serious weight, look elsewhere.

B00GZZYWDK|5|these are good, honda is crap.  this should have been a repair on a Technical Bulletin. Why am i spending 20 bucks to repair a Engineering flaw in a Honda vehicle. Removing all of the plastic covers is a bit of a challenge. go to youtube they have excellent videos expect to break about half of the clips when removing the plastic covers they are built in and integrated into the cover so no way to fix it.  the covers will snap back into place even with the broken clips, somewhat but again you should never have to remove these covers ever again, these repair pulleys are made out of metal and this should be a one time fix never to see it again.  don't let the repair get under your skin it is fairly easy but you're going to break some clips.you're going to remove a lot of bolts and try to remember where all the bolts go to a couple of really small pieces I ended up losing never to see again don't understand where they went to I never took them out of the car not that big of a deal. draw a diagram or arrows on the plastic covers to show you which way they go when replacing them I lost my head and couldn't remember which end was up or how it actually kind of snapped in that was the frustrating part other than that just a lot of bolts a lot of ratcheting and kind of in a tight place if you're a big guy it's not going to be comfortable working in that backseat but even with all my troubles it only took about an hour.
B0066SSI9K|5|Perfect Fit! W140 1993 300se (s320) 3.2L
B000VBOTSM|1|I haven't bought this from Amazon because it was cheaper somewhere else. my advice, don't buy it. it came with wheels that don't touch the floor evenly because the legs weren't welded the right way, it came missing an 8.8mm bolt (swing arm holder) (I had to buy a bolt from my local hardware store). then I found out that the one bolt that came with the stand don't go into the other hole for the other stand leg because no one bothered masking the bolt thread hole from the sprayed paint. So, to reduce the risk of finding a weak welding, I returned. Save yourself and buy a real deal stand for you beloved motorcycle.
B00WY7V0S8|1|Crap. This is not good quality.
B005GK6X0A|5|Have an old diesel engine in our 1985 Cat 30. It seemed that the starter solenoid was not working. I purchased this one after carefully comparing the model number on the motor with the numbers listed on the Amzon posting. Yep it's the one! Turned out it was not needed (some other problem causing the difficulty) but this item worked and came at a good price. Now we have a backup if needed.
B007EA6R0Q|5|Better than advertised. Very sturdy.

B00D63HKUQ|1|It did not align on my 93 civic hatchback
B00B2ASVJO|5|Work great.  Just had to put some extra bolts in as suggested in the directions.  Called the company and they were very helpful.

B00BSESK18|5|Very nice scent and lasts a long time.
B007D5480S|4|This arrived on time as expected in great shape.  Installation was easy for me - except the heat shield blocked it from aligning 100% and we had to slightly force it into position which bent the very edge of the aluminum shield (maybe 1/8&#34; at most).  No other issues, on-line instruction videos were very helpful (except for the heat shield being in the way and needing to slightly bend it for the bolt holes to align).  Borrowed an appropriate torque wrench from Advance Auto store.
B007DBVS8C|5|Works great
B000COCRXM|5|Great ship.  Worked as advertised.
B00DHQ782C|5|fits perfectly! exactly what I was looking for!
B004I16YSO|5|Before you purchase this product you might want to know that the passenger side tail light replacement requires some extensive interior trim removal.<br /><br />The actual product is very nearly i identical to the original equipment. There is a slight difference in the opacity of the clear sections and perhaps a minute discrepancy in the colored sections. These differences could easily be accounted for by the age of the original and are not really noticeable unless trying to find them. The new part fits exactly as the original. The only noticeable difference is the red plastic used on the inside of the part while the original has black with silver paint over spray. This is not noticeable from the exterior and seems to have no effect on the lighting properties.
B00CB8WM2S|5|With all the news of kids being left in hot cars my husband and I felt this would be a great tool to have in both of our cars so I purchased two of them. Just an extra safety feature to have in case of an emergency. Let's hope we never have to use it though. The quality is great...
B004GFTC0E|5|I am posting another good review for the 3M 39045 Headlight Renewal Kit.<br />This product does what it claims.<br />Caveat: you may have to spend more time depending on the condition of the light being restored.<br />Do not expect a quick fix.<br />If you do each step completely the results will be a new or close to new headlight.<br />With the inflated cost of replacing a headlight, I am very happy with my results!
B00A93S3AW|5|Looks good.  Nice quality
B001EP292C|2|Rails appear to be very sturdy, but there was NO hardware or mounting instructions. There was not a previous hitch, meaning have to drill holes to attach, now have to find the hardware to get and instructions, didn't realize rails only didn't include at least instructions.
B000C0WN08|5|cheap hose and it fit on my 2000 tacoma
B00B8ZCIHO|5|Very good!
B00PBF7A5M|5|August 30, 2015 edit:<br /><br />I went on a crazy ATV trail this weekend with my T-Dub-something I'd never done before, and after this, probably never will again.  It just wasn't my cup of tea, and it was a whole lot of work.  I dumped the bike 7 or 8 times due to my inexperience.  Boy, am I glad I had these handguards installed.  The last time I went down, before I finally figured out how to work downhill switchbacks that aren't exactly up to highway standards, it was on the right side, and pretty hard.  After I picked up the bike (I got real tired of that!), I saw that the right handguard and front brake lever were bent.  That was a good thing-if I didn't have the handguards on, I'm 100% sure the brake lever would have broken, and then I'd have been up the proverbial small tributary of raw sewage with no means of propulsion, if you catch my drift.  Anyway, well worth the money, and saved my bacon for sure.<br /><br />Easy install on my 2009 Yamaha TW200.  The hardest part was cutting the end off of the throttle tube, and that took all of 30 seconds with my Dremel tool.  They were easy to get into position, easy to attach, and look great. They're very sturdy and solid-much more so than I thought they would be. I didn't have to modify or cut my levers, either-I had read that some people did, and I wasn't looking forward to that!<br /><br />I put blue thread lock on the screws that go into the front of the plastic shields, just to be safe.<br /><br />A smoking deal, at 1/3 less than what I read about them being priced 4-5 years ago.
B000CNB3U6|5|good
B002R0NIVO|5|Fast shipping, and a direct fit
B00S7FXA2U|5|Well it came fast enough. And when I opened it, it had also come with another decal, a gold mustache. However, when I went to apply the Infinity Aloha decal the transfer tape peeled off of the decal. It's not their fault I suppose, I guess I just got one of the not so great ones. But I managed to carefully get it off of the backing and put it on to my laptop. It looks off but I still like it. The mustache went on like it was supposed to so I don't know why the Infinity one didn't come off with the transfer tape. But it's still a lovely decal.
B00KBKOAGY|4|very good- con side is there is a little distortion and there is a glare off the edge -it needs tp ne blackened around the edges
B000EQ6FI6|5|Great product
B009NOZ5C2|5|Installed as a dome light in a 2006 Accord. Fits perfectly, no obstructions, has a heatsink on the back of the LED but runs cool so far as I can tell after several minutes of on time.<br /><br />Light temp is daylight - not blue tinted but definitely not &#34;warm&#34; like the original  incandescent bulbs. I would prefer if Amazon also carried a warm (e.g. 2700K) version of this.<br /><br />The brightness is decent and provides enough light to see around the cabin, although I had hoped it would be slightly brighter than it was.<br /><br />On the plus side, as an LED it should last years and won't kill your battery in a few hours if you forget to shut it off.
B005NLQAHS|4|It's worked perfect a soon as I connected it and set up Bluetooth it picked it right up! The only con is you can't erase or check ABS and others...but does give you live data and it erased my check engine light !not bad for the price!
B005JU5U3S|5|Smooth wiping and doesn't screech like the cheaper ones. It cleans the windshield flawlessly and easy to install. Hopefully it will last a long time.
B000H4LT3Q|5|Easy to install and looks great. Down side the adhesive is not that strong so had to retape the lights but they work and look great
B00NP61VDQ|5|I am currently preparing for this year's winter. So many times in the past I have waited until last minute to look for ice scrapers and I have been left without and instead using my credit card to scrape my window. My hand ends up frozen and it as an all out horrible situation. That will not be the case this year. I am prepared now that I have this 2 pack of Ice Scrapers and microfiber cloths.<br /><br />The scrapers feel very durable in my hand and the foam handle is very comfortable to grip. I don't feel like it will slip from my hand if my hand gets wet. The scraping edge is very straight and I am sure it will do a great job once our first snow and ice storm hits.<br /><br />I like the fact that this set comes with 2 scrapers. I can put one in each car along with one of the microfiber cloths that was included. Overall, this set of Ice Scrapers is a very good value and while I don't look forward to using these (because that means we will have winter weather), I do look forward to being prepared for what may come.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B005H12OO2|5|Fit like a champ
B00NNZTCR6|5|I love them
B0001MQ7E0|1|Terrific! Cooled quickly holds a lot
B00754T6TK|3|The product didn't stop the leak on my car. But the engine sounds a lot smoother and nicer.
B00OUULOHE|4|Dye worked great! However, I had a rip so, I used the repair kit which the dye not stick to... otherwise I would have given 5 stars
B000182DPG|5|Great product
B00IJXHJTU|5|finally a reasonable slider that goes though the frame and NOT the engine mount (Bike fall + cheap engine mount sliders = BROKEN ENGINE MOUNT!!! OUCH).  You will need to drill and tap a hole but it's worth it.  since &#34;Motovation&#34; sliders are no longer available for the Honda 919 these are the best alternative.  Also on the plus side, you can pick the color of your inserts.
B004OH8XEK|5|EDIT: I originally thought the fitting on main hose leaked out of the box. When I got a replacement and found it leaking at the exact same fitting, I decided that had to be more than coincidence. I discovered that the female end I was trying to mate with was incompatible, and the new actuator had actually come with an adapter that *looked* like just a plug. Using that adapter I had no problems, and likely the original was not broken.
B00VHGBVW2|5|Great product, nice quality of cables, clamps and carrying case. Easy ordering, quick delivery, got exactly what I wanted.
B000C59M5M|5|Was exactly what I ordered,arrived earlier than expected,fitted as stated,great price.
B00HVVVEYM|5|Very good quality!!  Heavy duty zipper and the design kept all our luggage dry during rain storms.
B0091Q3NCG|5|Works extremely well and simple to use.
B008BVZ94W|5|The compact size  for key chain is excellent
B00EKEGRVS|5|Love it
B00XY6WG5Y|2|A lot of play in these. The front block does not cinch up tight to the roll bar. I wouldn't buy another.
B00GX2PSOW|1|Waste of money. Cheap ?!&$. these are stickers not etched or engraved.
B005G82C8E|4|i bought this for my Mercedes SLK230 and it does not fit. It's close, but too big to attach to the bottom of my windshield.
B00O83MCGU|4|They look great BUT.. These will not fit in a 2003 frontier without cutting large clearance holes in the sheet metal of your truck behind the lights to make clearance for the dual lamp backside..These are about 1 inch too deep to fit without unsightly gaps... This is not a 1 for 1 drop in replacement for your OEM assemblies...<br /><br /> Instructions would be nice but since professional modification is needed, I understand why they don't even bother to include them.<br /><br />After using these a while, I've upgraded the review to 4 Stars..
B00PE5HSNS|3|Awesome looking plate frame, but I have had it on my car for less than 6 months and it has rust spots already.
B003ZWG6T4|4|Good product, fit my car and on time delivery.
B000JFJLQA|4|Works well.  I wish it had a place to set an oil filter to drain.  The spout works well for pouring the used oil into containers.  A lid would be nice to keep it covered when not in use, but otherwise this is a cost-effective way to capture oil.  I like that it holds enough to sufficiently capture oil from vehicles with lots of capacity.  No more worries of overflow!
B0002MA68M|5|Great price used them on my GMC pickup.
B000JFHMPC|4|I purchased this because I needed a spark tester that I could see in bright sunlight. It does this well.The only issue I have is that I don't get a good feel for how strong the spark is. It has a sensitivity adjustment but that doesn't really help if my spec says that the spark must jump 3/8 inches. For this I need a tester that I can see the actual spark, which means do it in the shade.
B000VVSPX2|5|have used it only a few times so far. I do like how light it is but it still has a tough feel to it. Packs real small and it fits like a glove.At the price I paid if it only last a year it will have been worth it but I think it will last much longer. Could not be any happier with it. Several of my ridding buddies liked it so much they got them also. Fits just like the picture in ad, perfect fit.
B005H12SG6|5|Mirrors are great, I have no issues with it, they were easy to install, no need to take off the whole door panels either.
B0009OR94M|4|They will get the job done but wish it had the in between sizes to make sure the size is accurate
B005643YFS|1|Cheap frame and it started to crack on the side
B008ESJFYM|5|Looks great.
B000GZR30E|5|So stoked that this thing works! I no longer have to use that stupid compression release!  Best investment to date for my 2001 YZF 426.
B004Q8L894|5|Easy to use and perfect for the weekend or occasional mechanic. I needed to adjust the engine speed on my lawn tractor, and it was perfect for this task. Just stick some tape on the flywheel and/or pulley shaft. That was it.
B0022ZX9UY|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B007QQRKXG|5|Right on time they work well. Thanks
B001EAQTRI|5|Made a huge difference in extra noise on bluetooth adapter
B004ZG643M|5|100% satisfied
B0009N4F8Q|5|looks cool
B00JVHLS3G|1|Worst product ever. I bought this item and it turned yellow just after 2 weeks. It's also not an emblem but a sticker. Poor product by far.
B004W5O5R8|5|Perfect fit and great quality.
B008LP8SLE|5|Ok
B000CPJK9A|3|Shift knob has a great weighted feel, Good quality overall but I somewhat worry about the longevity of the knob far as appearance goes. The finish seems to be scratch heaven if not careful. Also if you have a short cylinder for your shift knob to screw to you may suffer from the knob &#34;jumping&#34; up and down on shifts. The bottom of the knob does not screw to a base or anything and this to me is not safe and the product was returned. The only thing holding it is the plastic adapter and it seems like sometime one day at random the whole knob will come straight off if not careful during some serious shifting.
B000NPDL76|5|fixed my car finally
B0024E6QX0|4|We have 2 of these and they work great for when our camper is parked and when it starts getting cooler out. They are really good at reflecting the sun so the camper doesn't turn into a oven in the summer and in the fall they help keep the heat in during deer camp.  We haven't had any issues with them falling out on there own either.
B00IAZ66T6|5|Just what I'd expected !<br />Thank you :)
B0002SRDEG|5|Awsome !
B00UZYIJ68|5|fits
B000E2CVT2|5|Absolutely my most fav oil filter to use in my 2012 Kawasaki Ninja 250r.
B008XB9BJY|5|So far so good! Direct plug in replacement on my RV lights, and they worked great.  Bouncing down the road 2000 miles with no issues and the color was good, light was good- and the wear and tear on my batteries- great!  Very happy and a good price too!
B000KKLLX0|5|Great product
B000CAXS1Q|5|Just like O E
B00GSAUHB8|2|Did not fit in my windshield properly therefore it hasn't been used since the first day I tried it. The corners are extremely flimsy so heat easily penetrated into my vehicle. It's been folded and on my back seat ever since.
B00FH8P1DG|4|as advertised. Its bright, and easy to install. Lets see how long it lasts.
B00EHM289S|5|Just what I wanted and speedy transaction
B002GTKAHQ|4|For $11 these are great. You have to mess with the tightening of some of the adjustment screws to allow you to swing the mirror out far enough to view the sides while keeping it tight enough that it doesn't move easily. overall I am not disappointed with these mirrors.
B004N5WHE0|5|Great car wash that keep the shine up. I use Liquid Glass polish as well.
B006LGKIM2|3|It's Ok , what I like about it is that you have your drink right in front of you, easier to grab especially if your bike doesn't have option of putting a water bottle on the frame, material is kinda cheap tho, which is why I took away 2 stars.
B002MQCYO0|5|Works Great
B0083G3AXC|5|Perfect for my chair!
B004YR49R0|5|2005 Jetta GLI (Mk IV), works and fits beautifully.
B00BB0FQLQ|5|Fits perfectly. Kind of a sticky substance on the underside of the mats. Possibly as an adhesive to prevent it from moving about (which is any partly taken care by the locking mechanism). Great buy for the BRZ giving you a piece of mind.
B00MP6U70K|5|Came packaged well and very easy to install
B000BGK22E|5|Replaced another valve.  Other valve was tight, sticking and leaking.  This one is smooth with no leaks.  Very easy replacement.  Four bolts removed, valve removed, valve replaced, four bolts replaced.
B00FSBE7MI|2|Poor quality, which was very discouraging because of all the great reviews I read about it. Seems were already fraying upon opening package. Zipper came off track on first zip up due to bad pattern design. Do yourself a favor and just buy an old camper shell for a few hundred dollars, which I have done.  I returned the tent the next day.
B00EENUGD0|5|Awesome helmet. Great fit. Looks super sleek. No more mushroom head. Fast shipping. Definite 5 star
B00HTOB0NG|3|Lights still flicker off. Never contacted seller.
B00504R7JS|5|Spot on
B0049MKQD6|5|Good quality
B002M496MK|4|The light works and fix perfect, but the bulbs on driver side was always on bright and passenger side was on dim I couldn't correct them
B006K8GKBO|5|This was for my husband. He said it worked great.
B000C40S92|5|Best price that I could find anywhere. Car rides good again, however, was missing the replacement bushings and washers in one of the boxes. Had to reuse the old parts.
B000EPSY90|5|Perfect fit for my 1986 6.9 Ford diesel. I like the extra foam pre-filter.

B00BWT353C|5|I PUT THESE IN MY TRUCK I PUT THEM IN MY CAR. HELL I EVEN PUT THEM IN MY COMPUTER  SO BRIGHT SO RIGHT!!! VERY BLUE WOW
B0090ZJPMK|1|Junk. Never worked with 2002 Dodge Ram 1500.
B004QEJ6CO|5|Great addition to my trailer. love the coiling.
B008CQFDCE|3|Great lights but not as described. It was only 18 watt 6 LED lights, not 27 watt 9 LED as described, still a pretty easy install and look good.
B003E1Q952|3|the hose seemed to kink easily, but functional, I just always struggle with water hoses, perhaps with use it will get better
B00EECM7BU|1|Installation was easy. One bulb worked and the other didn't. Swapped the bulbs to see if the not working bulb would work in the light that had originally worked. Neither lights turned on. Swapped the bulbs back to where one bulb worked. It doesn't work anymore. Neither bulb I ordered works. Pretty disappointed.
B005MZXB0Y|4|Like this very much.
B009EL6HSA|4|Feels great on my 08 grand prix base no codes jet
B000AR7KVA|4|It's OK. A little goes a long way, so I probably will never need more.
B001IN5IQ4|5|Great deliver put it on car window at first but then took it off and put it on bumper well made most stickers lose stick after removing them
B008PHIB1A|3|Fits small model cars, not mid size or larger.
B007233G1I|5|Fits perfectly on 2015 Toyota Tacoma 4 door-short bed ,TRD Sport. Product listed as fits 2004-2014. Arrived within 4 days in Hawaii.  One of few companies that ships to Hawaii.  Product arrived without any damage.  Includes Brackets/bolts/washers/nuts/ instructions. weighs 15lbs. Has slots for fog lights.  Installed within 30 minutes.  Highly recommended!!
B00771ZJU6|1|Radiator damage
B00FL2DO82|4|Good product. Bolted right in place
B000CSRE72|1|The spark plugs broke off in the cylinder after a week
B001DCEXUC|4|works well
B00EAOI8RY|5|Used this filter and no problems. I've always trusted the Fram name. Looks to me like a high quality fleece filter. I'm no expert at all, but never had any problem with any Fram product.
B00ZV19JNC|4|Great product, fits well, clicks nicely to seal all parts although I had to shave the battery housing cap to be able to seal the shell.
B008I7R36Q|1|Didn't fit my vehicle even though the listing said it would.  Had to return it.  Disappointing
B00PT18QAQ|4|I had ordered both the TireTek Pressure Gauge and the Michelin digital tire gauge,<br />and decided to keep the TireTek. I liked the construction of it which I thought<br />would stand up better to the inevitable drop onto the garage floor, the swivel head<br />which helps with fitting it on my motorcycle as well as cars, and the fact<br />that there are no batteries to replace. I had actually bought the Michelin<br />gauge previously through another online source since it was given their &#34;BEST&#34;<br />rating. However, after using it four times in three days, it stopped working<br />and I wasn't interested in buying 2 lithium batteries right off the bat to<br />keep it going. I didn't even open the new digital gauge package after<br />trying out the TireTek first. I said, &#34;I could live with this.&#34; Thanks also to TireTek for<br />taking the time to contact your customers and get their feedback. I hope<br />I'll have many years of good experiences with it.
B000UVUAFO|1|does not working
B0006O2PBW|3|When compared to the the same item purchased at the car wash it is definitely cheaper to purchase online, however I've notices the scent isn't as strong or last the time period compared to my purchases from the car wash. Not sure if this product was sitting for quite some time in storage or if it's just a knock off.
B006GZHJTS|4|The tail light is perfect for what I plan to do with it. It's quality is very high also.
B009WDX1NE|4|Good looking but bigger then I thought.
B00HCROOR4|5|As good as OEM. Installed in less than 10 minutes.
B0068VS8A4|5|Great light, I put this on my hitch mounted luggage rack for a little extra visibility.  I have it in the center, have the dim wired to the tail light circuit, and the bright mode on the brake light switch.  It works well and is fairly bright.  LED's are brightest looking head on, (they are more of a spot lens than flood)  Overall good light, I'm happy with it.
B00BITJUUS|4|just like the factory ones that came off of the car. Perfect fit and true to color.
B007CLSJRQ|5|The original Subaru wheel locks at a more reasonable price than at the dealer.
B002GZ2VUO|5|Great vision and performance for a great price. Can you ask for anything better?
B0009N0W60|5|great, got with license plate
B0037IWZVO|5|Well worth the money.  I use it all the time
B000HRF04M|5|These Ventvisors worked as promised. They were easy to install, as long as you follow the directions to put the back tabs the rear windows on the outside, where the window divider is. The fronts also need to go between the weather stripping and the black panel at the B Pillar.
B001D1X56G|5|Good parts for inexpensive price
B007AJF4JQ|5|Excellent quality and very stylish.
B0000AY69V|5|I use this to wipe the bathroom walls after shower since I don't want to use squeegee. It's really great for what I use it for. Plus, it is &#34;big&#34; for my need so I cut it in half.
B004NTIQQY|5|Easy install. Pulls the stuff
B001T7JWN4|5|A little pricey, but like al Flitz products, great performance.
B004I0JZBI|4|fits perfect for 1996 ford contour
B001V418NW|5|Very happy with purchase
B0073JI1NE|1|The finish on the chain is pretty much worthless.Day one was already chipping while in pocket.
B00BLBAVGA|4|nice
B005DUN5NG|5|nice
B001DRHNP4|5|Great quality filter and easy to install
B00S4PL6TM|2|I am not exactly impressed with this towel using it for the first time.<br />Better results with a water sprite imitation chammis.<br />Will revisit after several uses but currently no better than a old bath towel at pulling water away from the paint.
B000BNZ5BU|5|great product
B007TD1WIK|4|necessary evil in car-thick cords-well made
B003XNGLJU|5|I am very satisfied with the purchase!
B00681BE2S|4|Amazing item
B00S1ETE0O|4|These filters appear to be of good quality. They were the same or better than the ones I replaced. The only problem I had was the colored o-ring for the lower filter didn't fit. It was too big. I was able to reuse the old one, but it should have been changed. I will re-buy, just hope the rings are right.
B00FAY7QLW|5|Great fit Great product
B004BGYO5Q|5|Very nice product . Great quality . I loved it . Thanks
B000GZYP78|1|Spend your money on another product, works as advertised if bike is washed as soon as your ride is done and the bugs are super fresh
B0073G2N40|5|They work great, bright, matching colors and no flicker. I'm hopeful they will be trouble free in the long run. My vehicle has projector lenses and the light is bright, but properly focused/adjusted and do not blind oncoming drivers. I am very pleased with these lights.
B0088GZYH2|5|Didn't peel or fade after 2 years.
B00BTL9ZOG|4|Worked well direct replacement good light and verry Green
B00RYYUAQ4|5|Looks great
B007ZLO75Q|5|Great product.
B008G31D4A|5|Exactly what I needed, and the only down fall is that it does not include the inside cover.
B00DB8R6KU|4|You might wanna change screws to bolts when installing...
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Wow! Super bright and we'll built!!!!!
B00LNDXZ28|5|Not only is the light exactly what I needed, but the product was delivered with lightning speed. Its so nice to know that there are still companies out there that believe in taking care of their customers. Thanks so much for showing me the light.
B000S2QWFC|5|my friend like it!!
B000LG5ZM6|5|easy to program
B000XEBI9K|5|so good for my new car
B007TXZWPO|5|Worked liked a charm and so easy to install.  So much cheaper than taking it somewhere to be replaced.
B003KIYDAM|5|Patches are great. Instructions clear and patching completed very quickly. No issues at all.
B00GTEQXYS|5|Nice buttons
B0054CVBKC|5|Road from EauClaire Wisconsin to Boston 3,407 miles round trip and 14 days total.  The batteries lasted longer than rate by 2 hours, easy to use and very clear. Water prof and quick to charge.  The safety addition that these radios made in this long trip was well worth the money we paid!  I would highly recommend this model.  Sena SMH10D
B000H3EC1I|5|Fit great works great 35 minute install great deal
B00J7X3EO0|5|Fit perfect, amazing quality, pictures do not do it justice, fast shipping.  Tons of compliments-
B00GWEUVIY|4|Did not work right out of the pack, I had to file the inside edges quite a bit for it to be wide enough to push the clip out. Not a big deal but had to be done to work at all. Used on a 1957 GMC so this may work as is on later models.
B006WFQPH4|4|FYI I just bought this at the Mini dealership, can you believe they were actually having a really good sale on the bike rack.  I saved so much money I decided to have the dealer install it.  Everything was great till I put my car in reverse.  The reverse sensor, you know the one that beeps at you when your getting to close to objects. Well this doesn't beep beep any more, it SCREEMS! It screens like when you've actually hit the garage. This might not be a problem for most of you with little driveways but my driveway is over a 100 ft. I called the Mini dealer and asked him how to turn off the reverse sensor thinking this would be a simple solution. His answer was &#34;IT CAN'T BE DONE&#34;. So just thought you should know. Other than that it's a great product.
B008N44BAA|5|Max currently stands guard next to my tv!  Very durable and heavy plastic, worth every penny
B001KNYUAM|5|The part is well done and work like the original item, definitively a good purchase at a grate price.
B005FL5O9Q|1|I order front and back rotors but only got the front ones. and I paid $250 for this.it cost me more to ship it. I just want the rear rotors
B005FI5BBA|5|I did have to saw off the &#34;Doctor Who&#34; part of this so I wouldn't get a ticket for having the state name covered on my license plate, but it still marks me as a geek, which is what I wanted. :)
B012XIP074|5|The lights make it so much easier to see all the gauges. The bulbs are especially great since the old lights in my '76 gmc motorhome were very dim.
B00WGPFK4I|5|Seems to be working well in my Jeep. I can tell the air smells cleaner.
B0080E6UNO|5|Great, in place and performing well. Thanks
B005AWV3CW|1|Ended up not working for my bike even when model and year was put in correct
B00COYNZJ8|5|Best sun shade EVER
B000ALJ4F6|5|Easy
B000WJED8O|5|Excellent product and highly recommend
B00CO84R8C|5|lotta compliments!! hard to get them to really format the car, but sharp looking!!
B011AQOH10|5|So perfect! I see so many Grand Prix locally and many have aftermarket taillights, they have the other kind that have the led row design. I've only had them on a day, and have gotten so many compliments.<br /><br />They took about 10 minutes to install, and are completely plug and play into the stock wiring harness.<br /><br />Much brighter than stock lights. They fit perfectly and were also packaged better than any other thing I have ever bought online.<br /><br />I expect these to hold up great. They're made by spyder auto, and as usual, they have great weatherproof silicone.<br /><br />If I do not update this review, assume they were just perfect, because by the looks of them, I could not be happier!!
B002NOG974|4|Just as I expected had to bake a few adjustments but all good and works well
B002IDTWNI|5|Just what I was looking for
B00M9OK0O6|5|Matched exactly as described. Made touch up of my wheels extremely easy!!
B00BQN5SUW|4|Might need some breaking in as these are very strong at the moment (even after being on for a couple months.) Either way, better than having the darn door landing on everyone's heads! Hopefully the door doesn't go flying off now from the force.
B00CZDQU3G|5|Great Quality sticker/Decal
B007TY2HQK|5|A little loud but it it works perfectly.
B008G1XL2E|5|Items brand new, and as described!  Great deal!
B00BLPQ0IE|5|looks good
B009XIP942|5|Work well; stay in place.
B00HS5HECC|5|I repalced my stock brakes on my 03 Silverado with these and I have to say I am very impressed. Braking is so much easier, and it didn't take me long at all to replace all rotors. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B004JATRZQ|5|This fit perfectly on my 2004 Suburban. It even included the necessary gasket. It seems to have a slightly deeper tone than the stock cats, and it seems that my throttle response in noticeably improved, based solely on the calibrated seat of my pants. Significantly less expensive than other brands. I've always had good experiences with Walker exhaust products.
B005Q0TZ7S|3|Would have been 5 stars, but I don't like my cds to fly out when I turn a corner tightly.
B006GFL5UM|5|A good and solid padlock, fulfills the purpose, operates smoothly!
B00DI8Y9TE|5|This is a very nice keychain.  I also had the back engraved with my husband's name and date.  He really likes it.
B007OSL3DY|5|product arrived early...fits perfectly on the tailgate of my 2015 silverado LT...great product...durable n safe!
B00MO76COU|5|Product as described. Used on inside of a fly bridge hatch on a boat.
B000E4SMH0|5|Thank you!
B00BMUPKUW|5|The contacts were to large for My current system & power sonic sent Me adapters right away, awesome Customer service.
B00HSTX274|5|ok
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Installed two of these as the front parking and side marker lights on a 2001 Lexus LX470 after one of the 194 incandescent bulbs died. They work and look great.
B009W997X6|3|If you are looking for something that is not complex to use and can get one side of a bike up...you have found the right thing.  Trying to get a Harley touring bike up...as in both wheels up off the ground, is just slightly easier than picking your own parents at birth.  It might be better on a sport bike or smaller bike, but if you want something that can get a touring class bike entirely up then I would look at something else.
B000GV8QAO|4|Good price, very nice
B00U83BL5C|5|Very good bulbs much better and brighter than standard halogen auto bulbs. Much safer great buy.  .
B00C5RBAJQ|5|Excellent...durable and easy to install.
B009XOTRBM|1|If I could have left &#34;ZERO&#34; stars I would have. Product is very mild steel and has no reinforcing ring around where bike rack slides into. This thing got so sloppy within 100 miles I had to take the bikes off and load them inside our trailer to keep other motorists from flagging me down and telling me our bike rack was about to fall off. It does not pay to buy the cheapest one on Amazon. Do not buy this product! You will hate it. In case you were wondering I only had two adult size, aluminum frame mountain bikes on the rack.
B00M74WROE|5|Very nice. Very solid. Fits well. Thank you.
B00SDMJLQ6|3|Did not work with the seat belts in my 2015 Hyundai Sonata Limited. Seems like a nice product and very sturdy, though. Had to return.
B003HB5VNK|5|Fast shipping and great quality👌🏻 thanks alot!
B00A740VQM|5|Great
B000TMCX72|3|Nice but to large - get the 90-degree plug in instead
B000F5HUUI|1|Will not work on a Honda CRV
B000BUTD9S|5|Easy to put on and really did keep a lot dirt out of our camper!
B002L1DDKA|4|Nice kit but with issues, rag joint will not fit a camaro [1979], pitman arm taper was not deep enough[had to ream to get to cotter pin hole on center link],had to buy correct rag joint. steering box went right in and works great.The other parts have issues.
B00SJ7KYJ8|5|Great seat cover the feel and comfort are incredible will definitely recommend.
B00FY7M0CK|5|As described if buying for a SAAB note this compressor dose not have a charge port so you have to have a manifold hose assembly with a charge port on both the high and low pressure side's.
B001KW00NY|3|Not completely waterproof:(
B0051D3MP6|5|My motorcycle wouldn't start up, so I decided to look for a charger. Found this one at a very affordable price. Easy to use, and easy to read. Blinking green light means accepting charge and is charging the battery. Solid green means battery is fully charged. Hooked my battery up to the Black and Decker charger and left it overnight. Once fully charged I hooked my battery back up to my motorcycle, and started it right up with no problems. Great product, Great price, and did exactly what I need it to do. Couldn't ask for anything more.
B000TK8NN2|3|This is must have to go with any of the Air Horns.  the Wires were the right length to mount the Stebel Nautilus Compact Twin Air Horn i also bought, but only if i mounted the horn where my old horn was. My Bike is a 2012 Heritage soft tail classic.<br /><br />Wires were easy to run using the existing conduit under my gas tank, I ran a fisher wire and taped the kits wires to it and fished it through the conduit to the battery area under the seat.<br />Actual wiring took me 20 mins all the connectors were there, however, if you mess one up you will be short as this kit only contains what you need no extras.
B009DJTSQQ|5|Works great and was easy to install
B0023SWPAA|5|Very Good!
B00GTR3SFW|5|I love the way it looks. It sticks on great....
B001S30KSA|5|These AC Delco filters are the best in class, as rated by independent labs.
B005PN9030|5|Fit fine
B000AA4RWM|3|I had a set on my 15 year old trailer and they worked great. Put a set of these on my new trailer and the one on the front that gets a lot of sun exposure blew out in a month, which appears to be a common complaint. Considering I screw mounted this one, it sucks to replace it with a different model for I now have 2 holes to fill. I normally would chalk this up as an anomaly and order another, but given that I've read plenty of similar experiences, I'm not going to repeat.<br /><br />The other from the set works just fine. A good mounting strategy is to level the trailer by using a high quality carpenter level placed on the floor inside. Then it's a piece of cake to mount the level outside, but I would screw it in unless using 3M automotive tape. Once the included mounting tape heats up, the leveler can droop or slide just enough to no longer be accurate unless you use the super duper 3M automotive tape.<br /><br />For $7, its a great deal for the set minus the blowing out from direct sunlight.
B000GS1GXG|5|I love it!
B002MXUCXS|5|Got for my brother he loves them! Light weight and easy to use
B00J1C1Q92|1|Not a good product. Ill sized. Grommet holes in the wrong place. No cargo mat included for the trunk, despite description.
B008CM5VTS|5|Great for adding hardwired gadget to your car
B00DSD6SRK|5|Awesome Unique Classic Original Nirvana Rock Band sticker.  100% original and puts a smile on my face.  The Black is the exact perfect Black color.  It blended in perfect with my Black car.  It's hard to tell if it's a sticker or if it was painted on my car.  See the attached pics.<br /><br />Looking at this brings me back to the time in my life when I was a Teenager and Nirvana was a big influence to me and how awesome the music was, amongst other things.  Lots of great memories and now random conversations with people asking about it and reminiscing with not just my friends but also with just about anyone who sees it and says something about it and sharing their own stories and experience.<br /><br />Thanks to the seller for providing an awesome genuine Symbol! Hope to see more.  With there was a way to chose a seller to add to &#34;Favorites&#34; list, like Wish list
B00470U9QO|1|In my discussion with Ram, prior to my purchase, I asked them how stable this was.  They assured me it was very stable. Well that is far from the case. Yes, very easy to install, that was correct.  But once I started using it, I found it to be quiet unstable. It would shake while driving to the point of not being able to glance at the screen and see anything but a blur. After only a week of use, I had to take the shaft out and file down the clamp part, as the shaft was moving around.
B000PA48I0|5|Perfect fit for my car. Definitely recommended.
B00QAMKNYK|5|great
B004VR08E6|2|I was really really excited to get these in the mail! I placed my order knowing it gave me the &#34;want it Tuesday?&#34; Order by &#34;this time&#34;.<br />I was surprised to get the notification that the order had shipped around the time it was supposed to arrive.  Fast forward a few days and I get the package.<br /><br />Remember. These are long steps so the box is good size. When I went to move the box I has happy to feel how heavy it was.  That's where I stopped being happy.<br /><br />The steps are pretty light weight, less then a few pounds each. The bottom of the step is slotted Aluminum and the rest is plastic with the rubber section for your feet.<br /><br /> The instructions are pretty basic and straight forward but not labeled for any one truck. Can I assume the instructions in the box are for my specific truck?<br /><br />I laid out all the pieces, 4 mounting brackets on each side and the hardware to attach them. The brackets seem well made and are plenty heavy.<br /><br />The issue is the brackets bolted up to my truck in 2 out of 4 spots on each side. ( 2007 Chevy Silverado new body style) The top mounting holes for the brackets were not present on the front driver and passenger side.  I mounted the step on the brackets (only mounted to the hole in the rocker panel) to give it a look and see if it was worth drilling some holes.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I did t like the quality of these steps, the flimsy plastic shell over aluminum didn't do it for me. The brackets were not easily made to fit (in my case) and they hung down to low.<br /><br />I'll be returning these.<br /><br />2 stars because of the over all quality, cheap feel. Steps didn't fit correctly and shipping delays.<br /><br />The figment issue may not be the manufactures fault but I have to warn potential buyers some how.
B00I3U2ENK|5|much much smoother. can now feel the primers getting seated.
B003VFNZEY|5|Perfect! Good quality! Worth the money!
B003CUHXD2|5|Love it!!!! i have a f250 cutting my time in half
B00LU4JXYE|4|I thought this was going to be a lot bigger but it is actually quite a small little fellar.<br />Still looks good with three of them stacked on my work truck
B000KL18XW|3|Hace these in my 1999 f150 and they are great for keeping the mud off my carpet when i go fishing. Easy to take out and rinse off. However, they dont fit tight up against my floor panels, but its not too bad. Worth the money in my opinion
B00390BS7C|4|Worked for replacing both oxygen sensors
B0084L0YR6|5|It worked great. Got my a/c back working!!
B0009I5WS8|5|Works as described. Plug and play for my 2003 Forester.
B00J4Z9I8W|5|Was relatively easy to install to replace the old switch.  Definitely worth the money verse buying a brand new scooter!
B012XIP074|5|Wicked fast shipping. Install in my interior and license plate lights went pretty quick. Very bright lights! I love the pure white/bluish color of these leds. For the price of these wonderful little lights, this is a much needed upgrade to the standard bulbs in your vehicle now. Only time will tell if they'll last.
B002L7C3IC|5|Just as advertised and even better! Didn't realize it was metal. Very solid, better than the factory emblem which was plastic. Easy set up, I had to remove the grill but if you have small hands/arms you might get away with just removing the fan/radiator shroud and reach down in there behind the grill and radiator. That being said, removing the grill wasn't difficult and is probably the easiest way to install this emblem. Love it! Looks great on the front of my Silverado.
B00EQGDW7C|5|Good deal complete set.
B001P3VJR4|5|Great product
B0001EWCP6|5|I love being able to crack my windows even if it's going to rain.
B00BMX2ROG|5|Love this tail light for my moto looks great and I get compliments on it all the time
B00PW30ZPU|5|I have a Chrysler and this fits the best. This is literally the anti freezing mechanism that I opt for everyday. Really a nice product! The price is very affordable and the quality is really great. I would say that this is a must buy for intending customers.
B00NHMDRD0|1|Ok, for the price I really shouldn't complain, but they simply did not fit without some modification.
B00FKPJJNY|3|Started to flicker after about 9 months, but super bright, daylight white light. Not super durable looking connections.
B0006IX89G|5|works great
B0089SZW62|4|Great product,allways is usually with the dorman name on it:)
B000NWA6TU|5|Truck runs like new, always use AC Delco plugs in GM rigs
B00KKKZ5PA|3|U get wat u pay for ..
B00GR2W6CU|5|I love this decal looks great on my Macbook Pro Retina 13 inch and also the American Flag looks great on my iPhone thank you for the great product love and love to show off my American pride THANK YOU !!!
B00H9Z3GNM|4|Great! Exactly what I qanted and needed but I didn't realize how big, bulky, and heavy it was
B000BGOCPM|4|fits great. really happy.
B008GVFZKU|5|They offer several light patterns and are very bright.
B00BTLEJXI|5|Great seat covers but I had to return them as they don't exactly fit my 2015 Jeep patriot quite right. So once again trial and error. But good fabric and colors and it was made very well. A+ seller and item.
B000RL5QCO|1|Zinc Covered steel that rusted on the first time in saltwater. Returned and never went back.
B00V20SDSS|5|I bought these lights based solely on the photoshop abilities on that BMW motorcycle as well as the Mercedes SUV.
B00EYKCS8E|3|Like it don't love it - does not go far for the cost
B002R0KJDY|5|This was a perfect fit for my 99 Altima. I was able to replace the damaged light in just a few minutes. And, I saved a bundle.<br /><br />If I'm ever damaged in a parking lot again, (and paying for it myself as the jack apple that did it ran away) I'll not hesitate to buy another.
B0049LRH7K|5|As promised, at a great price.
B00HNMLQAG|5|JEFF FROM BURIEN WA, IS A &#34;BOSS&#34;
B008QDE43W|5|Excellent interim wax. Cleans off bugs with ease .
B000BRH0DW|5|Amazing product fast shipping!
B007NU5SX4|4|jacket is very nice runs at least 1 full size small
B0006H938M|5|works perfectly.
B004OFNJZ0|1|Fall out of window
B000S2ZPXW|5|Fit perfect and easy to install
B001OZJNUS|5|very nice for small jobs with lots of hose I coupled with oil/water in-line separator and &#34;t&#34; style nipple and kwik connector
B00LDNKGUC|2|One of the lights burned out almost immediately.  Had good luck with apex in the past, but not this time.
B00W0SR2JM|1|if you want to actually know your tire pressure use something else.
B00K53HC6C|5|As described and prompt shipping
B008XNZZ7O|3|This smelled delightful when I first opened it and even for the first week. It was fragrant like a fresh-cut cantaloupe or some other summer melon. However, after the first week, there is no smell left unless you either shake it or hold it up to your nose. There is plenty of gel &#34;stuff&#34; left in the can, and even some liquid in the bottom of the can, but the lingering smell is no more. I would say it is not great or terrible at odor-elimination.
B004CZJO3I|5|Perfect thanks!
B00CFQUNKE|5|Good cable, good price, fit.
B000C5GATI|1|agreed with the rest of the 1 star reviews.  This item was a total waste of money. It does not &#34;fit&#34; very well at all and can be wiggle free even after it was lock.  Also trigger my Check Engine Light because it wasn't sealing properly.
B000CP0KHG|5|Excellent product, great price.
B000CD5QNQ|5|What a difference this made in our 2002 E150 XLT! Night and day. The only compliant is now it exposes all the other issues with our suspension!
B00829HJ32|5|Aisin is top notch quality . Perfect
B000K05L86|5|Perfect, the only filter I use on my common rail.
B007ICD7GM|5|Works great
B00T9LR6BC|5|Best product ever!!! I've added it to my Bike windshield and all my glasses, helmets and goggles and it works like a charm!
B003YLXDGU|5|Love it, love it... My favorite animal
B0014JQ13Q|5|Looks like the photo and it fit the car.  What else can you say about a license plate holder?
B00P9OF04I|5|This is the best and easiest head light cleaner out there. Basically wipe on wipe off and the lights look as good as new.
B008P0ZEOY|3|Very Nice
B00FZQ1G8Y|5|Installed easily and matched my 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Maybe should have bought two so one doesn't look shiny and new while the other looks weathered.
B000RLPNLI|3|It is built well and works but I gave it a 3 because the socket needs to be turned 180 degrees just like you would normally plug into a 30 amp socket on a pedistal. I use a Surge Guard and I can't conveniently see the digital display with the socket turned the way it is. If the socket were turned around I would give it a 5.
B00VEP2NGE|5|Great item and shipped quickly
B008A8Z810|5|My son loves it!
B00F3QD0RQ|5|I won't wear anything else under my helmet. You can't feel any seams and it soaks up all the moisture. This is my second but not my last.
B004ULDW28|4|Hubcaps were as described, Silver finish with Chrome Lug Nuts. I will use them, but was really looking for full Chrome ones. I found them locally at a lower price.
B000EVWEKO|5|good price, good gauges
B00WRUIVW0|1|I hate to give it a 1 but it did not fit my 2002 Volkswagen Beetle at all.  Not even close.  I'm not sure which car it is designed for, but don't try to put one in a 2002 beetle.  I will be returning it.<br /><br />Looked OK other than the fit.
B0063CU57W|4|Very good
B00DL1K1QI|5|This is exactly the item that I required.
B001VF2UWO|5|Well made.
B0076ULE70|4|Perfect
B006TMQOZS|5|Just what I needed.
B006F8YTYO|5|Fit my sons PW50 perfectly and with alcohol in the grips they went on and have stayed nicely.
B001PNIJM2|1|OK beware again this is not the correct replacement switch for Lt2000 don't buy it
B00BJNTMFG|5|Worked perfectly and they delivered it straight to the dealership my car was at!
B004UQQMYI|5|makes glass crystal clear.
B00KJ189EE|5|I received it in time and there was no damage. I have installed it on my 4 wheeler and have taken it through some deep mud and it hasn't leaked or condesated at all... however the description didn't tell me it came with a wiring harness. Other than that it was worth my money
B00ENOP4M8|5|Fit just right. No prblems
B00KGID0ZS|5|Fit was perfect boat starting great!
B006JRJF72|5|Perfect for our RV.  Easy to install and it works great.
B0096EFVBO|3|The pad itself works, plus the name & symbol looks great . But the company that  makes theses needs to do their homework the length is to long for a 2011 G37x so it makes the belts sag. That`s if they even want to fix this problem because I had read the reviews about the same problem. It does look cool in the car. My rating is a three because of the fit.
B00COYNTNK|5|I love the Mickey sunshade. It fits ok on the Honda Pilot, just a tad small, but it works.
B0066QVESY|5|Perfect fit and easy installation.
B00IYZN3G6|5|Great chain for the price & included sprokets for the price of most chains.
B006NZTZLQ|4|Excellent adapter. Software on android is quite good, allows graphing as well which is great. Very fast communication. I think Torque is a little bit better to use because many people online share PIDs for your vehicle, this allows adding them but it's slightly different, I haven't messed with it too much. I think the app should have all the code descriptions stored (or automatically download them when the code is displayed) rather than clicking on a website. Better than my small handheld scantool I use for work.
B000SL2GNU|5|Great for the car
B00FOKOKM0|5|Saved my couches, they now look AMAZING!! would highly recommend! !
B008BE02GO|5|Very nice lights. Makes a big difference
B0016C5YF2|5|Exceptional !
B002IVER3A|5|What an easy way to tune up the old Honda generator. It had a rough idle but the new plug fixed the ie and she runs like new.
B005GHB5U6|5|Very nice,even fits my large,yet handsome head.
B000CSPEX8|5|it worked
B000AMBNPY|4|works well, without the problems I half expect because of reviews.
B006X27RF0|3|Works but needs to be adjusted regularly, before and after ride.
B00UBD55DI|5|Perfect
B009X23B2U|5|Easy to install. Works great!
B0009IQZPW|1|I personally am disappointed in this item - for $7.00 plus change for just 2, I thought this would be the same sponge applicator that I got as an applicator when I originally purchased the Meguairs NXT 2000 several months ago - the sponge applicator with Nxt wax was thin soft sponge on one side and flat (not thick sponge) on the other where your fingers to apply.  This one is soft sponge on both sides, not like original applicator of better quality.  I could have purchased 2 sided sponge applicators for a lot less money and with greater quantity. Definetly not worth asking price.
B00BFSYKOS|5|I love these things they look so great inside and outside the best.
B00E1SMDNE|5|they work great fit perfect
B00HJ1592C|4|I love it , but I had to reglue the shoes.
B009TB53Y4|4|Well designed mat for my MDX, fits well and easy to clean up. My only gripe is the material is thinner (foam like) than I expected
B0000AXY62|5|Beautiful, perfect length, fits, good value $. Installed on FJ Cruiser.
B005N00G2E|4|Looks good on my car!
B00MEUMDRM|5|Brought these for my sons 2005 Honda Element about three or four months ago and he loves them, good on gas and performance he says.
B002G38WLI|5|Perfect! Fit my Mercedes C350 2010 perfectly!
B005U80V6K|5|They thought of everything when they made these.  Love how they bolt on.  Very secure.
B00WR6ZRG2|5|Pleasant transaction excellant sale thank you
B007TY4STY|5|I installed this in my 96 silverado k1500 couple of weeks ago and it works great. It was a perfect fit and the price was very cheap compared to the auto parts store. It arrived 2 days before it was supposed to. There's also a step by step video on YouTube if needed. (Don't waste your time removing the steering wheel part can be removed and installed with steeringwheel still on)
B001812M9C|5|It works  great
B0119XYO3K|5|Awesome product! They even have a YouTube video on how to install it and how it looks before and after. But honestly you don't need to watch the video because the install is that easy.
B00VURR8CU|1|The logo is the old focus logo not the newer one, and over all quality is terrible, will be sending it back
B00FHSIYE4|5|Good product! Very good quality
B006H34BUY|5|does what its supposed to do for a decent price.
B00ARUTSZQ|5|after having someone take my driver's side mirror off, this fit perfectly. was really pleased with the product.
B00QZHPER6|4|It's a gel pad.  Obviously a one size fits most and not as implied for a Triumph America only.  Otherwise it is fine.  Works perfectly on my Suzuki S40.
B00029WYEY|5|The cleaner woks exceptionally well.  I rinsed my air filter because I forgot about the cleaner.  I thought I had done a really good job until I added the cleaner and the rinse water turned black.  The oil seems to be good quality too.  Perfect if you need to clean your lifetime filter.
B000CKGAV6|5|These Sylvania 9007 XtraVision headlights work great! I used them to replace the factory headlights installed on my 2003 Cavalier LS Sport. They work well at night, no complaints!
B00B7PT7Y2|5|Great thanks
B00199FYP2|5|PERFECT FIT !!!
B00CG0IXCE|1|This looked very cheap when it came in the mail. Didn't end up using it because of that.
B003VDX5D2|5|works very well....I am a big guy and have no trouble getting into the back of my truck now! would deff recommend!
B000MLF7CS|1|i had an older version of this scanner, so when it broke i ordered the new version.this version doesn't work on a 98 jeep Cherokee although it should. i emailed customer service and was told i need a soft ware upgrade (for a 98) i told them i would also need detailed instruction to install upgrade received none. it seems you need a program to make scanner upgrade possible. poor customer service
B00JGQM1WO|4|super!!
B000KIMHRQ|4|I'd give it 5 stars, but the connector for the thermal probe broke on first usage.  I thought it was just really inaccurate, but it must have broken when I plugged it in.  To be clear - the probe connector is two pieces, the actual probe which looks like it has sort of spade style ends on it, and then an adapter to connect to the multimeter.  The positive lead on the multimeter end of that adapter is what broke.  I guess I could send it back, just seems like more hassle than its worth.
B00BDVOX58|2|It fits my 1999 E46 328i and fixed my vacuum leak (for now), but the plastic is incredibly brittle. The first time I squeezed the locking ring it snapped. It wasn't even cold! It'd been sitting in my garage on a 75° day all afternoon. I snapped the ring in a second place while I was wrestling it onto the CCV in the engine. With two breaks in the ring there's no way to get a firm lock onto the CCV, so it's only a matter of time until it pops off.<br /><br />There's plenty of other 11157532649 hoses for around this price on Amazon. Avoid this one.
B002MQAX9S|3|Ok not the best.
B008032Q2E|2|After installing fuel pump it doesnt work. Now Its saying I cant return it.
B00BFDG4QU|5|great products, fair prices, quick delivery
B000BZ6WF6|5|If budget allows try and use timken , not crazy about the inverted notches on this particular snap ring style but bearing itself is always quality
B007LICGWY|4|Love this plain black frame but it vibrates on the vehicle because it doesn't have bottom screws. I stUck some little foamy pads behind it and it solved the problem.
B00BMRZN66|5|Wonderful pump! It's works just the way promised. No having to pump by hand. It's battery operated and even has a handle for comfort. I would buy this product again!
B00BFX29YQ|5|Great product, went on easily, has held up well through weather and automatic carwash, receive lots of compliments..especially at tournaments.<br />Love it!!!
B008WC5CQ0|2|Came cracked and didn't look like I expected. I guess that second parts my fault. But it came with about 1/3 of it completely cracked off
B010MHV00O|5|This item arrived earlier than expected. Easy to install and it fit my 32 ounce bottle in my 40 eggs this item arrived earlier than expected. Easy to install and it fit my 32 ounce bottle in my 40 ounce bottle. Worked exactly as expected
B000OAG2DK|5|Easy to install. It fit all the original shower head holders. Color a bit different but of no consequence, still acceptable. The big feature is, to be able to shut it off &#34;after soaping&#34;. We dry camp a lot and can't afford to just let the water run. It's a real nuisance to shut the taps off, then start up again with the water temp. adjustment routine.<br /><br />This shower head works well.<br /><br />WW
B0001EVUBI|5|Fits perfect and still on tight after 8 months.
B00C39D2TW|1|Trying to install this without taking off the intake manifold is insane, i did however manage to get it done after removing my power stearing pump and bending some fuel lines. The mishimoto video dosent show nearly the amount of effort required.
B00ED31Q3U|5|Cool
B006N9392I|5|Fit good.  happy with purchase
B000OC3Q2I|3|It Locked down OK, the fit was loose and sloppy.
B00KX9D8WA|5|Excellent - Valve works great and can fill the gas tank very quick
B005MZZOCW|3|The magnet is too big this is suppose to be a baseball magnet not a softball magnet
B00HNGSLFA|1|Arrived broken. Doesn't the 2004 dodge stratus coupe
B00EA2EG0O|5|Antenna x gets 5 star all the way
B0060JGXLU|5|good oil for the price of what I paid for. the service was excellent.
B002A2L5K0|5|So far so good, Exc product
B004PC28VS|5|I'm not sure why but I thought these were going to be smaller but none the less I am happy with my purchase.
B00HFWZ1NW|5|Item match description; very useful. Thank you
B005BYC0YO|5|Great product & great price
B00377ICPI|5|I placed them onto standard black 3 step pullouts that came on the camper. I removed the plastic grab handle and centered the metal mounting plate over the old location. The kit comes with 4 hex screws but the plate has 8 holes. I purchased 4 more screws. I was able to swing the upright Bach toward the side of the top step. There was a 1/4 inch hole there. I then got a grade 8 bolt about 4 inches long to replace the shorter one that came with it. I also added a spacer of 3/4&#34; so when you tighten down the wing nut is is very stable. I also painted all parts and bolt with fast dry white paint. Looks good. The product is just square metal tubing. Had on past 2 weeks while on vacation. Everyone liked them. No more worries that someone will fall!
B0002UEOKK|5|happy
B007OX5YNE|5|No problems. Fits as it should
B005UGIW86|5|The best shift boot I have bought today I have bought 3 different ones and they have all ripped within the first year cause of the weather and elements. This one is going on a couple years and still in perfect condition
B0010DPCZY|3|White box stuff with AC Delco's name on it.
B0024NWX4C|1|I had body work done on my car by a reputable auto body company, so I bought these to reduce my cost. The owner of the company said these  lights are not adjustable. Also the way they reflect does not give optimal road coverage in the dark. The lights don't project far.<br />I still have them on my car, I just avoid driving in the dark.
B000EDQR6E|3|okay
B008SCWXN4|3|It works as expected but the software is a bit difficult to use.
B00GX2ZNS8|5|Very cool
B00C0YKJ6E|5|Performs Great!
B00O7ZAD6U|4|Good for the price..no issues as of yet..been using for about 2 months. .
B00JNEBF1M|5|perect fit
B001FAGKDU|3|This is a good product for the price, but many of the pockets and clips are pointless.  I just needed a good seat cover.
B0019VZYN2|5|NGK is best choice for honda civic I think.
B00ZQHT7JW|5|Better than we expected, decent battery inside and it's great fun to entertain the kiddos and actually looks nicer than our worn oem shiftknob!
B0013G040G|5|Perfect fit and delivered ahead of schedule.  Back on the road!
B004GFTC0E|5|I read the reviews and was a little skeptical at first. I followed all the instructions and I am impressed with the results. For the price you can't beat the results. I would definitely recommend this. My best guess is that I probably have about 2 more additional uses out of this because my headlights was not severe.
B000YQKOU6|5|Kits worked perfect! I had a small wiring issue with vehicle and called seller and they got me sorted right out. Top notch service and parts.
B000E28EOS|5|Nice rack! Very well built, just what we were looking for. Plenty of tie down points too!
B004NSEDQC|4|This is exactly what we were looking for
B00VLER31I|4|The frame is a little big and it won't fit on the back of my 2014 ford focus because the bow is too big. Other than that it's beautiful
B00ADIHUVG|5|Great light. Bought additional ones after first order
B00LC06RWM|3|I really had my hopes up on these little lights(and I mean little). The reviews mentioned how amazingly bright these are but in my opinion they are just ok . My plan was to wire them in to the outside light on toyhauler and have them mounted on steps.  One of the lenses has fallen out in the three days I have tested them and now expect the rest will follow suit. I have been sealing them with some adhesive silicon to prevent and further loss of the lenses. These lights are about as bright as a 70's American car dome light.
B005ZK48TE|5|Fits great!!
B00KTITA9A|5|Another quality find.
B00IQ5X91I|2|No details on battery just idiot lights, only works if battery has min charge pre-set in 3x5 box? So you have no control or real data to work with. Not recommended 👎
B005GYI1GA|5|Worked great, easy to install, durable.
B00062YAD0|5|well worth the cost
B000CB3ZHM|5|Great, in place and performing well
B0041LN1L4|3|Looks good, provides some protection but screws were too short and had to buy from store.  Why even include short screws this short?  The frame adds a some thickness between the screw head and mounting plate on car.
B000AA4RWM|5|just like the factory, a good replacment
B00T2GT9L4|5|Haven't had the need to use it on my Hybrid yet.  but hope it will work when the time comes.<br />So far the it works great as normal power bank, love the size, and easy to store in the car.<br />has the IQ function built in, can charge any device via USB.  the flash light is fairly bright, great for emergency use. :)
B00EPDB4TO|1|Wickedly difficult to change the date, time, etc...the instructions are terrible...would not this watch again.
B00PKYX4WC|1|I am glad I bought these.  I installed them this morning on our 2006 Volvo V50.  They installed very easily (like OEM) and only took about 5 mins to install both.  So far, they work great.  Very nice and bright.  Previously (2 times) I bought some no name brand bulbs on amazon for our car and I was getting fed up with them because they only lasted about a year.  But you get what you pay for.  I hope these ones last a few years, and I am hoping they do because they are Philips.  I paid about $75 for 2 bulbs, which is 7X more than the previous replacements, but about 1/2 the price for just 1 of these bulb replacements from the local Volvo dealership.  So far so good, but I will update if I have any problems with these in the future.  ***UPDATE: Jan. 21, 2016*** I previously gave these a 5-star review.  Ok so now I feel like a sucker for buying these for 7X more than the previous generic brand I bought from Amazon in the past.  I am starting to believe other reviewers who said that these bulbs are refurbished or knockoffs. These bulbs only lasted 5 months, compared to the cheaper, brighter generic bulbs lasting about 1 year.  I will go back to the cheap generic bulbs.  I can get at least a year out of them for a fraction of the price.  Still not getting the OEM bulbs at the dealership for $180 a bulb though. I'd rather change the bulbs every year.
B000RH2NP6|1|It only lasted 2 month before it broke again, and I barely use that window. The seller I bought it from was Sandman's Auto Parts. I'm not sure if any of the other sellers will be any better.
B0072TL2VS|5|Perfect!
B00QRHDIPY|2|Length not nearly long enough to work. Not good for PWC...may be ok for other things
B00D329B8Y|5|NICE!!! Perfect-- so much better than the ones that came with my car! Here's the story: we got in a car accident and had to have our car towed. We went to the junk card to clear the stuff out of our car, but we accidentally left our old floor mats. When we went to buy a newer, used card it unfortunately didn't have floor mats. We ended up using older floor mats that didn't really fit my car. My son has autism and this bothered him immensely. I didn't buy any mats until I saw some that were just the right quality because he is so picky. These were amazing. The rubber is thin enough to be soft and pliable and they match our car beautifully and protect the entire area of the floor. Our car floor needed to be steam cleaned, but because this covers the entire floor of the front seats, I really don't need to now. I am very happy with this purchase and am sorry I didn't purchase them sooner!
B00BQGXRB6|4|Wonderful, my sister bought this for me with her card and all i can say is this awesome
B002UCAELQ|5|They fit the aluminum ceiling mounted tracks on our 29 year old boat perfectly.
B007AXQT28|5|Really good battery A+++
B002Y351VE|5|great product!! fit perfectly and is light and strong.
B00MV1V80C|5|good for your boat
B001FANRDG|5|Keeps top from blowing all over when folded
B00CP6LU9M|5|The door latch arrived on time.  My husband installed it and it works well.  There seems to be no difference between this latch and the original latch.  Happy to be able to open the door easily again.
B000OKTCE6|5|Great price for quality part,
B00UPLV2OM|5|Very adhesive and easy to install.
B00G35E0AW|5|Perfect fit for auxiliary light system on my KLR .
B000EQRROM|4|Exactly what I needed.
B00027GTPQ|5|Perfect fit for indmar 350.
B006XJ9OPE|2|The glowing five star reviewers are either shills or have never held a solid piece of hardware.<br /><br />Not impressed; at all. Would not buy again. Feels cheap, tin-ny, and flimsy. I had to tap on the housing several times to decide if it was metal or plastic. I don't expect that these locks would stand up to a single hammer blow. Seller return policy is for me to eat shipping both ways, plus a 15% restocking fee. Not worth bothering with. I'm just burned for 8 crappy locks. I should have purchased from a PRIME seller.<br /><br />Pick something else, or at least buy Prime to protect yourself.
B00E1M7EXO|4|Works very well as a hydrophobic windshield treatment.
B000TYOQVQ|5|Fit perfect on our 2001 Pontiac Grand Am
B001UFRUWU|5|works great, easy install improved ride
B00YMHEENG|5|Very good.
B002M3KSK0|5|Fit excellent.
B0097EM9U4|5|the coilovers fit perfect!
B0009TAOGM|4|Seems to be of good quality - I tow a heavy boat and replace the ball every 3-4 years regardless.  Just make sure you measure your tongue thickness so you order the correct stub length.  When completely tightened the threads should protrude at least 1/2&#34; beyond the nut.
B00YRJI3D6|4|Very nice and elegant keychain. Adds sophistication and elegance to your set. It's sleek and admirable. I have already had about three people ask me about it. It doesn't hurt that this color goes perfectly with our office décor. It's durable, sturdy and all my keys fit and go on with no problem. The leather is smooth and is well made. There's a slight shimmer to it but it isn't sparkly. It doesn't look childish, but very modern I love it. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Works so goo I bought another!
B00RW7WGME|5|These are some of the best wipers I have ever bought.
B00ECTQNF6|4|Just what my son needed for his jeep to pass inspection...
B001BCGMI0|5|Mirror was an exact match to the original factory one. Shipping was on time and completely accurate.
B000GD5FMY|2|Comfortable fit, loved how well held air from getting in my eyes. Unfortunately they are poorly built, they broke trying to put them on.
B001V8U12M|5|great for lowering my scissor socket it takes less to lower the scissor jack and more time at play
B004C6OBBC|5|Excellent product..........
B00HWI6EVM|5|Love them!! Highly recommend getting them professional installed but overall they are awesome!
B00HQHTMM2|5|Item is as described, not too big and gives a nice finishing touch to your OEM Acura rims. I installed this on my 07 Acura MDX Sport. A mini wrench is included, however do not use excessive force when tightening cap since these are TPMS and in the future when you may attempt to open the caps especially living in an area with snow can have issues and damage the TPMS.
B0072JBBFK|5|Solid replacement for my broken switch. 2001 325i E46.
B000WMCJPK|5|Had to replace one on a small trailer bang for the buck this appears to be a solid well built product.
B00UG2QYSY|5|I love the look and feel of this product; easy installation without much too much of a problem.<br />I have a FORD CROWN VICTORIA POLICE INTERCEPTOR(aka) PANTHER and after the installation , I had 1 foot left over. Since the product is clear and the color of my car is silver-gray, looking at the trim, I could not tell if the product is on my car.<br />For those who owns PANTHERS, there is plenty of trim for your car.
B00ZOT9NNW|5|Works just as described and is well made and heavy duty. Great deal at around $30.00! I'm glad I didn't spend $80.00 or more on the Chemical Guys website. I do love their soap however.
B008ROAZH4|5|Good seller would buy again
B00515NG9G|5|My truck would stutter if I floored it from a dead stop. Changed cables,  cap and rotor,  cleaned air flow sensor and still stuttered.  Changed the spark plugs and now it's back to squealing the tires and being tons more responsive!<br />I'm sticking to iridium spark plugs from now on
B00V5AY2P8|5|Great value  High Quality
B006R0IY8M|5|Great item and quote, easy to stick on the wall. For my wall it was too long so I used only a part of it.
B00MR05HD6|5|Quality product.
B0006SH4KU|5|It is the best glass cleaner we have ever used,We are farmers and we use it on everything that has windows, combines,tractors,and trucks. would recommend to anyone. the only thing I would complain about is the packaging,a little leaked out in the pakage it come in,the seal in the cap leaked a very small amound, must have banged around in the box pretty hard.
B00D6PTESK|4|Looks like a decent quality product, I've had it on the car about a month.  Some of the edges were pretty rough but you can't see them without really inspecting it.
B0054M58J2|1|The one I received was counterfeit. Numerous spelling errors on box, and no reference to Toyota.
B003UT3XKC|4|Very good not high shine though
B00OAJ5S04|5|Installed in an hour on my 2008 Sierra.  Looks great and sturdy to boot.
B00O4CV2B6|5|great item
B000QQXAGE|3|The second set in 3 years. We think it was because our shocks were shot! Moog is the best out there in terms of Rep. I replaced our shocks with this second set. We will see.
B011P4DQBY|5|This is the easiest wax I have ever applied to my vehicle. You just spray it on and wipe it off. It's that easy!  It is like wiping water off of your car. It left very few streaks that easily buffed off after going over the whole vehicle a second pass with a dry microfiber cloth. I didn't see the streaks when I initially applied it but after admirering my work I noticed a few places that had streaked and I think it was because the cloth I was using was damp from the spray. They wiped off with a single swipe with a dry cloth though. One reviewer said that they wished that it had a finer spray. I'm wondering if the sprayer was defective, because the one I used had a fine spray that covered a large area with each squeeze of the trigger. The only other thing it might be is the spray head has 2 settings one for spray and the other for stream. You just need to rotate the tip of the sprayer until it says spray on top to get the fine spray.  I didn't really notice that it was that much shinier but it did let the dry cloth glide over the surface so I could tell it was on there and should protect the paint for a couple of weeks before I need to reapply.  I have a truck so I probably used more of the bottle in the one treatment than someone with a car but with the amount I used, the bottle should give me 3 or 4 more treatments.  It was so easy to apply I will order their vinyl treatment also to shine up my dash and the black plastic trim on the exterior.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
B0081ZZXBC|1|This is a copy of a letter I sent to Jegs, they replaced 4 caps but the new ones fail and are dangerous!!!!<br /><br />to:  Jegs Representative<br /><br />I am writing this letter for two reasons.  One, to ask your company to replace the enclosed caps with new ones and two,  to let you know that the 100% failure rate I have experienced  with your gas caps is not only unacceptable but a danger to anyone using these gas cans.  I have purchased several of the gas caps and cans.<br /><br />The problem comes when filling a gas tank on a lawnmower or four-wheeler that is hot. These cracks are not easy to detect and gas can leak from the cracks and spill on a hot engine, creating a dangerous situation.  I have not had a fire yet, but the possibility of one has been there on several occasions. These defective caps indicate a quality assurance problem.<br /><br />The ball is in your court.<br /><br />With best regards,
B004LZVQI0|4|Made in China. What can I say poorly polished stainless. My last Westin was great. Still very strong though hit a 100 lb doe that ran out in front of me one night no damage to this deercatcher or the F350, deer didnt make it.
B00CNY12P8|5|with an Audi A6 and a Audi Q7, I needed this to keep other vehicles out of my spot, love it, thanks
B000NWPHDA|5|perfect fit.. its been on my bike for almost 3 weeks and everything seems good.. thank you.
B00684TIVE|5|Great price and it was extremely easy to do the programming.
B002XMSFIM|5|accurate and faster than the wind up style couldn't be happier.
B00TQ662OW|5|They work Perfect!
B00B1F0INW|5|This fit perfectly in my 2015 Rav4 XLE. It's a must-have purchase to keep your groceries from flying across the back of your SUV. I leave it strung up all the time, even when my dog is in the truck. In the Rav4's, the net hangs close to the door and doesn't stick out to where she might become entangled in it (when it's empty).
B00T1QLW0G|1|My right back tint rip upon trying to put it on.smh
B004O7C2F6|1|Only the leg included. Picture is a misrepresentation.
B004OK6A9W|3|did not conform to my needs
B00480GYSA|5|Very good set of bulb though it made in Mexico.  Light color is much brighter than stock.  Unsure how long it will last, but I like the beam focus more on the road compare to the OEM which my GF complained she can't see clear at night.  Only thing I don't like is its bluish color in the core that might get cop to pull you over.  Otherwise, it's a great performance bulbs with a little cost over the standard one
B003VCBDG4|5|I installed three of this on my 2006 F350 6.0 diesel the F-111N on the oil pan and the F-108N on the block drains.  They are of high quality and I feel worth the price paid.  The F-108Ns on the block drain made flushing the 6.0 diesel cooling system a breeze I also installed plastic hose on the block drains. You have to remove the gasket on the F-108N and reuse the O ring from the block plug.  The F-111N installed on the oil pan should make changing oil much less a mess.  None have leaked they are a little tough to operate the first couple of times, do this before installing on the engine.
B001W6LGGS|4|I had my old wireless camera stolen (probably thought it was a GPS) by tweakers. I was able to install just the camera and it picked up the existing wireless signal which was a huge bonus not having to rewire everything.  Actually is clearer than what I previously had and would buy again (but hope not to lol).
B00VMMMSMI|5|Fast shipping and excellent quality
B00CFALFXY|5|This is actually  not what I was looking for but they are excellent for cleaning. High quality and good value.
B00M391QA4|5|Excellent
B000C3DDKO|5|Great little cooler. Biggest you can get to fit in a trailblazer, pretty easy to install. No issues
B00A4H1FYO|5|. Exact replacement part. Car runs great.  We used gasket and inner orings from our existing part which fit perfect into the new part. If needed again might think about ordering new gasket and orings. But this was not necessary in our situation.
B00I87PXZE|4|used this product after repeatedly polishing headlights on a 2003 Toyota corolla. Without the solution, the headlights would fade within a few weeks. After applying 2 coats of this product, I drover the car for 2 more months before selling it. The headlights were still clear! The appearance of the car looked nice too while visibility at night was greatly improved.<br /><br />A little pricey but works well and easily applied. Does it last for years? Since I sold the car I cannot support that claim by the manufactures, but if I see the old ride on the highway locally, I will take notice and update this review. I'm pretty sure the young lady who bought it wont be polishing the headlights.
B006QH55YM|5|Battery works great now. Can't comment right now since I just received the battery.<br />I will let you know in 4-5 years how well it performs.
B00CMSPFFS|5|Fit 2015 xterra as stated in write-up
B001O0XLL0|5|Very quite brake pad set
B004ANB3PE|3|Was nice at first.
B00LS77IOA|5|Very nice and very well made. I bought this for my husband and he was really happy with the quality, nice and heavy for the key he must carry for his new Mazda. I would say that I might think of buying one for myself in the future. The company was spot on for it's time of delivery. Thanks for the great service and product.
B0084C9VCO|5|Came in 2 days. One hour to install in my 2014 Ram Big Horn. Sound is great, just a clean deep tone.
B004AU3HT2|5|Great
B0040M31H8|2|American flag license plate frame, made in China, pathetic. No where in the product description does it say &#34; Made in China&#34;. Stop buying Chinese junk!
B00ANWV6OY|1|These wheel covers are very cheap and brittle, and they also cover the valve stem, so I would have to take them off in order to put air in the tires. A total waste of money.
B000WNPUUK|5|Product arrived early and fit my v-storm as expected. I went up one cog from stock for lower highway rpms and the change is great.
B00860EZAW|5|Perfect for Jeep Liberty CRD...Replace OEM with these and never worry again..
B00VAGA2EW|5|easy to hook up, works as it should. it is not back light and hard to read in low light conditions.
B00192JGY4|4|Helpful product.
B00MUKEQD0|1|Don't buy, complete waste of money.....
B0026QXY72|5|Looks excellent under the hood
B007F0T44G|5|I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves having them in his car!! They're perfect for winter time when you track in a lot of snow and salt, they stay so much more cleaner than car mats we have had in the past! They are extremely durable and protect your floor of your car to make cleaning your car not so much of a hassle. I love that you can just spray these off with the hose if they get dirty.
B006OCAP80|4|Cheaper than thru the dealer.  Easy to replace.
B00RW1ZRE4|1|Have to reshape aluminum to fit. Not recommended for 93 kx250
B00W9792J2|1|One blew off the top of my car within 5 days.  And the 2nd one is defective.  The magnetic strip does not work at all.  The cord wire was so short I was unable to plug it into my adapter.  They were faulty and defective.  I would appreciate my monies returned to my account or send me merchandise that works.  How do you plan on resolving this matter?  This has scared me of purchasing through amazon until this situation is resolved.
B000E7YP7I|5|A bit small for my needs, but the wife loves it.  You can fit two standard grocery bags plus additional items.  Rugged, well designed, with movable partitions, and excellent rubber grip on the base to keep it from sliding.  Best finish of any similar carrier.  I expect it will last for years.
B0015CN4VY|3|item was well wrapped. easy to install. problem is rust forming at back of exhaust after a few weeks after installation.
B000V53VR8|5|Genuine. Replaced 2 years ago. Only trust the OEM products especially for FORD. (Showing picture of the new and 2-yr-old filter to compare).<br /><br />Motorcraft products provides the best endurance and protection for your beloved mechanical buddy. They are not for high performance, might not give you most output from your vehicle. But they are, for sure, the best in protecting your vehicle from getting humid or water into your engine.<br /><br />Yes, I have used all kinds of &#34;high performance&#34; products like AEM, KN's Cold Air Intake, Royal Purple stuff on my previous Mustang and P71 CVPI, they do sound better, respond faster. However, they will wear out your vehicle faster than the OEM motorcraft product. Now that I'm getting older, the vehicle is more a &#34;transportation&#34; or road trip companion other than big Ego. So I'll give it the best protection as possible to keep it running well. (Of course, I still use Motul, KN, BMC product for my Kawasaki Ninja bike ;P)
B007CLNIJK|5|Perfect
B00JJZ1SLM|5|Glad  I bought these. I have a Jeep Liberty and the window would only stay halfway up. Now, they pop up as soon as I push the button, and they stay up! Why did I wait?
B0016KFY0O|5|Great!
B00V7ZIN6U|1|we'll see how long it lasts... spent for the Gel supposed to be longer lasting.<br /><br />Update... Junk didn't last 2 months
B001GRSTRM|5|I was a bit leery at first as most 'custom fit' items don't.  I was pleasantly surprised to find these do, and fit very nicely.  I only ordered the fronts as I almost never have anyone in the back seat anyway.  I don't drive in a lot of snow but do get caught in the occasional rain storm and the day to day crud that seems to fall off one's shoes was making my original HHR SS mats look very old, very quickly.  I hate loose mats that tend to wind up almost sideways after getting gin and out of the car a few times but these do not look like they'd do that.  Both driver side and passenger side fit very well with all the contours.
B00LMQMOUU|3|Good color and brightness, but after two years I had 5 out of 12 flicker and die.<br />I used these in under-counter lights to replace incandescent bulbs powered by 12 VAC.
B000YC42RG|5|Works good.
B010CUCS3E|3|Received a bad default set of vent visors for 2004 ford explorer please resend me another set please.
B0058HZJZQ|4|Ok
B010CAEXW8|5|Goes on and off easily.
B000EQEQ9Q|1|the wire's came covered in grease and finger prints .
B00WDSVEE8|5|These are much better built than previous ones that broke.  Also, you can adjust the amount of flip-up you want, so you can see the controls on the interior of the car, while still having the protection from the sun outside.  Great product!!
B0066IUP9G|1|Most everything these days is a 50/50 crap-shoot. Even brands with previously stellar reputations are turning out some pretty lousy stuff. This Peak GPS is kinda on the crap side.<br />I've driven right past streets (very old, established roads with rusty signs) that I'm not seeing on the map. On more than one occasion it has told me my destination is on the left when I can clearly see it on the right. Apparently this unit is a socialist. Default mode is on the left.<br />The map update page is a 404 - does not exist. The Peak website has no mention anywhere of any GPS unit.<br />Connecting it to my PC results in a message that a connected USB device is not working properly and I cannot find an updated driver anywhere. Oh, and it isn't seeing the SanDisk I put in. I know they're small, but really?<br />When I've enter my next destination while I'm stopped, say in a parking lot, I have to commit to a direction and drive for thousands of feet before it will calculate a route (based, of course, on the direction I've chosen to go which isn't always the right direction).<br />There are times it just has no idea which road or ramp I'm on when there's more than one or they run parallel to the highway. (Whoa! I'm going WHERE???) It works well if you already know where you're going, but...<br />Obviously I bought it because it was cheap. Well, I saved a few bucks, but I wouldn't do it again. Next time I'll go with a Garmin or Tom Tom. Probably a factory reconditioned unit, you know, to save a few bucks.
B00IZFNJ6Y|5|Perfect little tester
B000C9MBX8|5|OEM part as listed
B004WLROZW|2|Half the hardware in parts bag is missing.Is not worth my time to return it.
B0046REPPE|4|Nice and heavy duty.  I had to return for the XXL size since the XL was a bit snug on my fingers.  I would normally wear XL gloves.
B00F6GKKQC|5|love them they are good the use and cheap to buy worth the money
B0013JDW34|5|Its yellow.  I put one bulb in my super tenere and it works good.  However 1 week later i put on a set of piaa led driving lights under the headlights and with those on you cant tell the headlights are even on.
B0002SRL20|4|Works good, but had to calibrate it by taking it apart and adjusting screw to match actual air pressure delivered.
B000BZIPRE|4|If you want this bearing to last forever, you need to add some 500 degree high temperature grease to it. Carefully pry the rubber seals off and pack some hi-temp grease in it. I use them on my endurance road racing race car and have had zero problems.
B001RBCU90|5|This is a great way for me to express my special bond I have with my dogs. I never have seen a Ying yang symbol used in this fashion before.  It's on my side window of my suv.
B003VDX5D2|4|Nice light duty but functional
B00BAZBYTU|4|Good job
B00NWF61GC|4|Worked as advertised so it was worth the extra to have a genuine GM part.  Easy to program and worked the first time.  Much less than you would pay at the dealer.
B00G9WLWSM|5|clear definition! and perfect on my Laptop!
B000JFHNQA|5|Needed this for the boat.  Extra piece of mind!
B007NNJBWU|5|great product  love it  very fast service
B005FQH96C|5|Easy install
B009MATAEG|3|Nothing against the seller on this one just the shade itself is cumbersome and awkward to roll and unroll to install.  All in all very good coverage if your willing to put up with the task.
B0057WYM6Y|5|i like this one ~~~~
B00820NOWG|5|You have to buy this tool if you are going to remove the fuel pump. This tool worked great perfect fit. I did it myself and saved over 800.00 bucks. Spend the extra couple bucks and get it now.....Do not use 2 screwdrivers and a 12&#34; adjustable wrench, or make a crazy home made  4&#34; pvc tool that is junk like the you tube videos...
B004A42MZI|1|tried it several times and it has not worked!!
B00SM0PDPM|5|Was a snap to install. And when night came I turned it back into day.This light was over the top impressive.
B002PEYXMA|5|awesome product !
B001N72FES|5|This is the best gadget ever! We had a very old suburban that the battery was always getting drained somehow, no matter how hard we tried to find the problem.  Now I just twist the knob to turn it off or on, and my truck starts every time. No more dead battery or constant use of jumper cables! I LOVE this product!
B00QB23I8W|5|Perfect! & were very easy to install
B000C9PMGG|3|I was kind of pissed to receive an item that had already been opened and was attempted to be installed had some wear marks on product  plastic was torn  Open
B00WXS2AX2|5|I have tried other whiter halogen bulbs, HID bulbs, and other LED bulbs without satisfaction. These may not be a &#34;perfect match&#34; of the angel eye halo lights on the newest BMWs, but they are the best I have ever seen. Mine look just like the advertisement picture. In addition, the round shape makes these the easiest to install. You will not be disappointed.
B004YNEYHE|5|The fit is great!  The finish is great!
B006ULI1QI|5|Pretty. Went on easy.
B00BITHRJY|5|Fit the car well and no issues.
B006HI4XCK|4|There OK
B005109IZ2|5|Love these! Will be perfect for game day, a little big for my mirrors,  but they will show that I am proud to be a RAZORBACK!
B00KTJ8FM2|3|I had to take them somewhere to get them programmed, and one of them so far hasn't lasted very long. May be the battery, but expected it to last at least a yearn , not a couple months.
B00GRISB78|5|This light is amazing. I mounted it just below my headlight on my Suzuki DR650 and wow what a difference. It's so much brighter than the headlight. It amkes the headlight look yellow it's so white. well worth the price as long as it holds up.
B000C2G5S2|4|It fit like it is supposed to
B006GFLI0O|5|I like the fit and I like the style. It does what it's suppose to do soak up the sweat and it does it very well in style.
B006UH5B0G|5|The caps fit good
B00OCEGONM|5|Just replaced struts on a BMW E36 tonight; this tool made the job easy. Throwing my old spring compressors in the trash..
B000SQFD4O|5|Conveniently sized spare plugs for my tire repair kit on my Goldwing.
B005V9OOWA|5|I was dreading replacing my headlights because it was just a cost I was not willing to spend. Yeah, new headlights would make my car look better, but my old (yellow) ones still worked-basically it was cosmetic so more like a want than a need. When I came across these, I was like WOW what a reasonable price plus the reviews were very good. I went ahead and bought these, and I cannot even explain how much nicer/better/newer my car looks!! Under $100 and they make my car look totally different… I cannot believe I almost didn't invest in new headlights! I'm so happy I did!!
B0031OYB84|5|Good fit on my 610 Mule, and the quality seems good. So far my dog's nails haven't poked any holes in it; which is what happened to the original cover.
B00XRE70LS|5|I'm pleased with the purchase.  It is very well made and feels like it would be good protection.
B0000AXRH5|5|Nice, small easy to use.
B000B7RCLM|5|Great price and fast shipping. Item is in use now.
B007TYORCC|5|Fits perfectly into the car just like the factory one on the other side! Love it!
B004AIGB4W|4|Outstanding product.  From visual inspection and initial use, it appears to be made better than the OEM regulator.  I would have given it five stars except that the Dorman regulator had three studs on the motor which required me to purchase three fasters (3 6x10mm nuts and 3 washers).  If the part would have come with this, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />Of note, the OEM part had two studs on the rail and three bolt holes on the motor.  The Dorman product used five studs and fasters instead of bolts.  This actually made it much easier to reposition and install (except that you need three nuts that do not come with the product).  My car is a 2005 Ford Escape V6 (3.0), so this part may fit perfectly on other models.  Only note I have is that before you begin the installation, make sure you identify if you need additional fasteners.
B002E53RN6|5|Just like O E
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Lights are super bright! Excellent seller!
B00469L0KA|5|Great on glass
B0028033SQ|5|Great product
B010L7N8H8|2|I am not happy with this product. They keep falling off the windows......
B002OUQI3W|4|functional but a little awkward to take apart and put back together.<br />BE SURE to take the box with you when you shop for a lock, not included.  Bigger hasp locks will not work, not will very small ones.<br />We plan to use ours with a regular lock, in combination with a cable bike lock.
B00EJS9E3S|4|Quick shipping, however it does not come with a new bolt for the exterior shaft which has proven to become quite annoying.<br /><br />The outer casing also does not match the stock one. As it only come with one side of the case, I couldn't use the other half of the case from my old motor and had to swap all the interior mechanics into the old case.<br /><br />Other than that, works great.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Great car shade! I love that it's easy to pop up and and folds back so compactly that it doesn't take up a ton of room. As a mom of 3 kids under 4, I appreciate convenience & practicality. Definitely would recommend!
B00BR05EEY|5|Perfect match, very happy!
B00IG7S768|5|fits perfect
B003B800JE|5|Very good quality parts. It's together with a rubber mallet in less than 10 minutes
B007QU4FLW|4|Looks sharp...goes on easily
B00008RW9V|5|I've used this product in every car I've owned for the last 20 years. Pro tip: keep it in the glove box INSIDE the plastic bag that it comes with. This will extend the useful life of this by years.
B00FSG8224|4|These are good.  They are more yellow than I light.  I have them in lights over the mirror in my travel trailer.  Cosmetics color are better than higher output White LED bulbs,
B00797MHGC|5|A must for the car of every CCW holder. Almost no one will know what it says because of the ancient Greek characters, but it is a great ice breaker for explaining the Second Amendment.
B00CYJF7DA|5|When Alfredo the Cat left a stain from a tummy disruption, I decided to try this when all else failed. It worked magnificently and left no suds. It is an easy clean!<br /><br />Val Lee of &#34;val lee weblog&#34;
B008FDDISK|3|Beautiful decal but it didn't last long before the stones were falling off and the ends were curling up. Needless to say it lasted 4 months before it was taken off the car window.
B003ZWHW1K|5|Worked great and better quality than the latch that was originally on my Toyota.
B00R26RCVK|5|This seat cover awesome - I ski and mountain bike​ quite a bit and my wife has always complained about wet, muddy seats.  More expensive seat covers didn't really fit well, and were more trouble than they are worth.  This cover howerver, is awesome - I just take it out of the glove box and put it on the seat when I'm wet/muddy.  It stays super well, even though the attachment to the seat is minimal.
B00U05XVOC|5|good product
B000CJ061C|4|ok
B004VGAJOG|5|very nice. saves me money
B000CIONP8|5|Best customer service. The right part, fits great.
B00MVVCI4M|4|I enjoy this steering wheel cover very much, however it comes darker than shown in the photo.
B008V2N2KE|5|Fit my R56 S perfectly!!
B0016ZBP1Q|5|excellent. water is hotter than ever
B00PQDUOSO|5|shipping was pretty slow .but works well very bright . but can not tell any difference between low and high beam
B00GBW9BG0|5|These are awesome stickers
B00RCJVMK4|5|Great all weather cover
B0097M83T2|1|Product does not fit correctly in third row of 2015 sequoia. Too small and dimensions do not fit as described by seller
B004HM1CEK|5|Beautiful, easy to use, great product!
B00O2N11UO|5|As expected
B00JFWKM2K|5|Giving it 5 stars although only had it connected for a week.  Guess I won't know it REALLY works until something happens with RV park power supply.  At least I feel like I'm doing what I can to protect my significant investment in the silver Twinkie.  Using a cable lock to secure it from quick snatch and run theft.
B00MHCWLII|1|It stop working
B01092I9LA|5|This is a great buy. Better then expectation, it took me no more then 45 minutes to install my new car seat covers. I love it!
B009Y33MH2|5|I like this a lot.  It puts the kleenex handy and out of the reach of my Havanese dog who loves to shrewd kleenex.
B00LC8AV80|4|Works great. Battery connector clip was detached, but easily put back in place. Plug and play otherwise, inserting the 'guts' from my old unit.
B008PIDTDY|5|I like it
B000CNJ66E|5|does what's it's supposed to do. easy installation.
B005Y1U9PG|5|Perfect fit perfect in every regard much recommended
B00BQYCJKI|5|The best towels I've ever used to wash cars.

B0093RRSXS|5|Thanks
B002MB2XX2|5|Nice product!
B00KXERB78|5|Works like a charm.
B000IYPSZU|5|Easy install, fit perfectly
B000BZL07G|3|It worked great and was easy to install!
B0055DQCTA|5|Worked as expect in my sons PW50
B00KZD8ME8|1|It didn't fit my 2004 Infiniti G35
B001L9KI56|2|I bought the large by accident, so my bad I still like the device, just need smaller diamter. I will either return it, or ive to a friend, and get my size.
B00FUTUYIY|3|To my surprise the kit did not include the reverse shifter shaft seal and the shift fork seals distorted when I put them in for unknown reason. Had no problems with replacements from another supplier. The thrust washers appeared to be cheap stamped steel like most modern replacements so I used N.O.S. Muncie washers in their place.The kit also does not include a countershaft which is not always needed. Otherwise everything was fine.
B001CF1XY4|5|Very happy works well
B000EDUUIA|1|It is too short and car wouldn't stop. My car easily went over it. Totally waste of money.
B009DK3PX2|5|Fit perfectly
B00MJZZ9A0|5|Gorgeous!
B005XV26RG|5|Great product
B0028321V8|1|Impossible to install on my 2008 MB R350. I had to return and pay shipping.<br />Had to go to MB dealership to buy the OMG  $100 for the set.<br />Waste my time and money on S/H. Don't buy.
B00BZ9KI48|5|Fit perfectly over my wide frame glasses and are a comfortable fit.
B00PMKWD1W|5|Carry it everywhere
B00651OAVS|4|OK
B00NOAJK1S|5|Looks good in my frs and works fine.
B0000AY69V|5|There is know other way to dry a vehicle, simply the best.
B00CP6PF52|5|Very good just what iwant it
B00D2JZ4UW|5|OEM replacement that is working well
B00BWAL7RW|5|👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
B00GUBV7D2|5|Perfect
B002UC2R8O|5|On our last camping trip my Dad did not realize how these handles worked and he snapped it right of which made it a pain to enter and exit our travel trailer. This was a perfect replacement for my existing one and did not even have to drill new mounting holes or anything. Just pay attention to what side of the door you need one for becuase there are left and right handed versions.
B000VU5IZG|4|High quality piece,with ample room for additional pieces,it lives up to the name
B008F8Q8K0|5|Fits well. Very bright.
B0014H19YY|4|Looks great.....

B0052UDMY4|4|Good product.
B000EDSSDY|4|works well for my needs
B00GULCWXG|5|This is a great accessory for your Razor if you are needing anything to stay dry.
B001O7PNS2|5|A must have in a car nuts detail box.
B0018GVUHC|5|Really really great muffler a little bit less loud that straight pipes
B0069H96YE|5|good to have  a partner for my old litle car
B011G7I26O|5|they fit perfect.
B000F6DNMQ|4|It does the job. I used a little extra tape to try to keep it secure on our smooth garage floor. I also learned quickly not to turn the wheel of the vehicle while it is on the mat, as that twists the mat off of it's mounting.
B000CAXH3K|5|Bando is becoming my 1st choice for a quality QUIET belt
B000SL4A84|5|Good deal.
B005JDQ9KS|5|Great rotors and great price
B0072GVX5G|1|Firstly, it seems that I received a seal that was returned.  It was missing one of the clips that hold the seal to the Jeep door.  There was a crimp in the seal that allowed water through (as much as than the worn out seal that I was replacing).  The crimp seemed to be caused by the seal being folded inside the packaging.<br /><br />The worst part of the seal though is that it prevents the door from closing correctly.  The seal was solid rubber right above where the door hinges are.  The stock OEM seal is hollow.  The solid rubber prevented the door from closing all of the way (imagine a solid rubber bouncy ball between your door and jeep body). I could slam the door closed, but then it was nearly impossible getting the door open again because of the pressure on the latch.  I assume this is why it was returned in the first place.
B002L7C3IC|5|Perfect
B007ZDGFPY|5|Expensive, but cool if you love your Mitsubishi like I love my Spyder!
B00ID2P60Q|5|Very good
B00681BDXI|1|Batter isn't working already
B00S4HFNXK|4|This is a great addition to my boat, helping to protect it when docked.  These make great companions to my round bumpers attached to the posts of my dock.  In the past the round bumpers have rolled out of place as the boat has pushed against them.  These square bumpers stay in place. I have been very pleased with these so far.  The only change I would suggest to make these a five star product would be to make them thicker.  Still I recommend these just as they are, a good value at the price point.
B002Y090BY|5|Best give every recieved &#34; Father's Day gift from wife &#34; love it
B00R5BHX4I|5|Makes my vehicle looks great. great instruction on how to install.
B000CIPUR8|1|Used 3 bottles. didn't work. had to replace the Cats.
B00FY0NREM|5|Since this is an OEM Part, there were no issues, all good high quality parts, and it took the shop &#34;Finish Line Performance&#34; 2 days to do the install of this plus a Teraflex Hinged Carrier to support the larger tires I was getting as well. Just make sure if you get new 35&#34; tires that the PSI is at 37 or lower instead of what some places might air it up with, like around 50 psi +.  There was no need for a front-end alignment either and the steering wheel was perfect center.  It is pricey, but hey it's mopar.
B00ZWRFPP6|4|The bulb fit in the fixture nicely and give off almost the same amount of light
B00PWJLPR6|1|Too small!!
B003S8DZ3U|5|Awesome for the money. For my 2005 ram 1500 slt hemi 5.7lt. Cost me $2.00 to have walmart cut it.  Very very happy.
B000VL9WL6|5|Just make sure you get the canvas  warm before you try to install it!  After that it takes about 30 minutes.
B000C9WL6U|5|Wix filters are the best. I put this on my 2000 Chevy Silverado. Not only is it a high quality filter, my oil pressure is better when I use these filters.
B00Y6RT0O0|1|Did not come out the way I wanted. It looks like vol&#60;SWAGen since there's no line for the letter K and no one understood it on my car.
B0030IMXG8|5|simple and removeable
B01015H5EM|5|Outstanding addition to my truck
B003U4P3U0|3|Nice shine, but leaves water spots behind.  Foams great though in my foaming gun and smells yummy!
B00F3D9T88|5|Get prouduct 2nd time around,after it was messed up on shipping packet wrong,was half hanging out box.
B000A6VC2Y|5|Best OEM filter for my Silverado. Mine was Made in USA too!
B00BMUDKZE|5|An awesome retro touch on any ride; pair with a simple thin chrome surround plate frame for a finishing touch
B00VJURTD6|5|Nice, bright lights. Good price. Looks great on my boat trailer
B003IS3HV0|5|excellent product! works as described great buy!
B00BY9XKWQ|5|awesome
B000UVGIGE|5|fits perfect 2008 g37s coupe
B000E4QM40|5|worked perfectly
B006ISY3J2|5|just like OEM Nissan. brand new as described. worked perfectly
B00AA5AX2U|1|Mayerial is pf very bad quality. The texture almost feels like a dead cat
B00A1X9AES|5|Perfect, great price something that will without a doubt appeal to those that change their own oil. This filter purchased 5 at a time is PERFECT!
B00S4UIZUA|5|Item looks and feels like original. Works good so far.
B000QR6XJ4|4|Definitely clears the odor
B006WQSDJQ|5|So far so good.
B00IZPZHBY|4|This thing is great!!! Only reason for the 4 stars, the mounting block had to be modified slightly to fit over the oil pan. Otherwise the thing works great and is pretty to look at!
B00C9Q17VE|3|OK..cool and nice graphic
B0096BH7LO|5|fits my car
B000C2AP9C|5|as described
B00A14QREI|5|Worked well on my 2011 Ford Flex SEL. Fast shipping.
B003WGM4TY|5|Fabulous product.
B00429Y8ZI|4|I like how tight the lid is. No chance of it falling off if knocked over. The solar can be charged with lights or sun. After a good day in the sun I haven't had to &#34;recharge&#34;. However I hoped the light would be better. The whole rim doesn't light up as I thought it would. It's bright on only one spot on the rim, by the hinge. The colors aren't as vibrant as hoped either.
B00029WYDU|5|Great
B002R109DS|5|Extremely pleased with the look and fit of the lights on my 07 Chevy 2500 HD
B009UHKOEG|5|My husband loved this
B001C6N78S|5|Exact replacement for ORM part.
B000BXME7I|5|Does the job!
B00877SL2M|1|This product will be very bright and easily seen when installed, but beware, these LEDs DO NOT LAST!  For me, the entire point of installing LEDs was to avoid needing to tear apart my dashboard to replace the lights again, this product provides the EXACT OPPOSITE of what I wanted, which was to avoid further maintenance on this part of my car.  DO NOT BUY.  These are crap.
B0097X6730|4|a little firmer than expected.. will need a topper :(
B00LXQZ690|4|Arrived on time, and as advertised. Customer service was also excellent.
B000C3BB6M|4|Works just great
B003LIX47E|4|OK
B004P23VQO|5|Perfect fit, great price, and looks awesome. Watch the you tube video for proper installation. I had a bikini top, but this is so much quieter, weathertight, and no water pooling on roof when it rains. This is a perfect year round top. Now I guess I'll have to sell my hardtop!
B000QGI6CM|5|Good price for OEM accessory.
B008M7IIIY|2|Seemed like a good idea until I actually tried to use them. Impossible.
B009R1EXWE|2|Not good for what I wanted ...to hold groceries in my SUV.  Too flimsy.  Need something if heavier material and construction.  Gave to a friend for clean socks and underwear
B00LHUI4XM|5|Very nice, easy to install and they do not obscure my plates
B005NLQAHS|5|Does what it's says. Works well
B000C7QKJG|4|It's the exact same as the cheaper one, so my only complaint is that I could have spent less money. Works like a charm, and the fitment was perfect, so I can't really say anything bad about it. It's a good, average product.
B000E28MWM|5|Fits can am 1000 commander
B0014DEVRU|3|the jaw likes to jam up and it dosent fit in most places ive used it. id recommend getting one with a spring built in like the mac tools one.
B00GIXFMHE|5|Excellent
B0048YKWO8|5|1994 Dodge Grand Caravan 3.8.  When accelerating onto freeway felt like engine was momentarily 'missing'.  Then speedometer went to 0 and rpm's up to 4000.  Was stuck in 2nd gear.  Limped home at 3000 rpm's (about 42 mph).  Both speedometer and odometer were dead.  Replaced the output speed sensor with this Dorman part and all was back in working order.  Shifting may actually be a little smoother than before, but too soon to tell for sure.  Needed to purchase a 25 mm socket to remove and replace the part.
B00MYCYVMU|5|I absolutely love it and the people wrote a cute little &#34;Thank You!&#34; on the back of the card which made me feel better about the product
B00124YOGY|5|Just what I wanted.
B00CPT7ODU|5|Excellent quality products from this company.
B000NOKNKA|5|Good
B00WAMMLXU|5|Everything fit fine no problems.
B001JT1EEM|3|This is great stuff if you need something to glue insanely fast.  It cures way too fast for any practical needs.  You definitely need to be a professional for this type of epoxy.
B00MWPC3VK|5|TOP SHELF HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B00NP61VDQ|5|These are really nice quality ice scrapers, I placed one set in my son's car because he heads to college in the Fall and the other in my car because it is the main vehicle used.  They are about 12 inches long and made of nice thick, sturdy material that doesn't bend.  The handles are a vibrant color with a solid grip (feels like foam over plastic) very comfortable to grip.  The bag came with two like colored towels as well.  It is a really well thought out package and will be very handy this Winter. I am anxious to see how well they work and will update this review at a later time.   I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review, the experience and opinions are my own.
B007KPERVG|5|They look great! Thanks very much!
B003UT3S6Q|5|Best I have ever tried and I have tried most of them!
B00BYH6C1E|5|Best device ever!
B00157TGXY|5|you need to be careful what you put into your RV tanks, because some other cleaners or things like bleach will ruin the non-stick coating on your tanks. this is made for RV tanks so it is safe.<br />my sensors used to read 2/3 even when emptied, until I started using this. now they always read E when cleared and my tank never smells. this stuff also smells amazing
B00JV15KN6|4|Works well and a good price.
B007KJJ2X0|5|Just like O E
B001G8AIMU|4|works as expected
B000GD5FMY|5|very very very nice !!!!
B000CQPW78|4|Good quality and price; had to return did not fit my car. Don't know what went wrong
B000C9U126|5|Just like the one that came with the car.  Love the tether.  Great quality, decent price too
B00230H508|5|EXCELLENT! Very inexpnesive way to make your original grips feel comfortable and look good without spending $100 - $200 for new grips (I have heated grips on my Harley.
B00877SL2M|5|Brightens up the whole exterior of the car.
B004A6LA9A|5|Just as well made (of the same material) as the major brands-good value!!
B00PIL6XX4|5|Fits around the steering wheel although it moves a bit. But, it does prevent the wheel from being turned. Nice visual deterrent against car theft. Looks and feels sturdy enough. Thinking of buying a pair for my parents' car.
B0070Y35OC|5|All good.. Perfect fit.. Great highly recomended...
B005345F80|5|Stays on my head at all speeds..I don't even have to pull tight...Nice fit .. no worries
B0066TPQ4O|3|When I received this in included two identical sliders instead of one front and one back slider. As shipped it would not fit into my door.  I had to dissemble and reuse the slider from my old window regulator. This required a bit of rework (punching out bolts, finding new hardware etc.).  At the end I was able to get it installed and has been working fine.
B003COTFS4|3|The winch seems solid. One of the bolts for the winch to secure to the 4 wheeler doesn't get completely tight. And the hook that comes with it is of must less quality then pictured. Better off going to Home Depot for a new one. The latch was slightly bent out of the box.
B00L2HRUN0|1|product didn't fit.
B000F5LISS|5|If you have Lucas Girling drum brakes this tool is a must, no question about it!
B0009IQXFO|5|Another reorder. Terrific for washing the car. removes the dirt and uses a minimum of suds.
B004GD1LKA|5|Absolute perfect fit! Removed two bolts took old broken light out and replaced with this one and two bolts to tighten down. Absolutely identical to stock equipment IMO.
B0041P1ZB8|5|I bought this for my 2013 KTM 300 XC-W and I love it. Sounds a little throatier than the factory and has a quieter low end. Does not have supper high pitch scream when I get on it like before. I have not noticed any lose of power with it. I also bought it so that I had a Spark Arrestor for riding on Federal property. I would definitely buy this again.
B000C2EE7Q|1|Toyota said ..it's not need gasket , only silicone...that's all
B00NGHLY4U|5|Perfect!!! Snapped right on my 09 Off-road with help from wife holding up the tailgate. No more banging my head or turning into a half closed tailgate on cold days.
B008UV5UE2|1|Very disappointed.  It didn't fit my mirror.  I even measured before I purchased it.  It should have fit.
B00M9NPR5Y|5|Love cometic gaskets. These shipped fast!  Perfect fit every time!
B004U3MYR0|5|Very high quality. Great fit and finish. Much better than the local parts store products.
B000630I5S|5|looks grate
B001C6OYVC|1|Worked alright for awhile... bought in 2015. Now the auto window switch wont work... a switch should work for longer than just a year.... would door be willing to send me a replacement?
B00I9VF5NY|5|The 10 ft covered 4 doors of my Honda Pilot.  Excellent customer service.
B000GTOOC0|3|It works, but the teeth on each side broke off after drilling about 20 spot welds.
B000EFMU4A|4|Great looking and great price
B002AMAXNA|5|I hope I never have to use this in an emergency situation, but I like all the features of it. The knife does indeed cut (I tested it on some cardboard), and it is near impossible to cut yourself with it because of the way the knife is obscured. I'm sure that this would be able to cut a seat belt. It feels comfortable in hand, and it is not very heavy. I also tried out the pointed tip on a car window and it does actually work (junkyard). I would highly recommend this product. $7 to potentially be the difference between life and death. It's a bargain.
B00CPQE4BI|5|beautiful patch  love it
B005ZLS2M2|4|As described.
B005JO1556|5|K
B006JD481Y|5|Great price....great product!
B00M7S2RL8|5|Keeps my adapters in place and keeps coolant from splashing.
B010EYQ60E|5|Great. Loved them.
B004ZF49AI|4|Great headlights. Much brighter than my old stock bulbs. I would have given them five stars but the directions suck. They consist of a very vague diagram and not much else, but after I found a how too video on YouTube it was very easy and installed quickly. I would definitely recommend to brighten up your night time driving.
B000CAXTDI|5|Perfect fit for my 1986 Alfa Romeo Spider Veloce.
B001D20X4W|1|Don't fit my honda civic 2006.....
B00F9IS6W2|5|Scootworks shipped this product very quickly. It was packaged well and contained all the needed parts and even extra tips for easy installation. It moved the handlebars to the needed length for me as I am 5'10&#34; and found the stock handlebar length had my elbows nearly locked and shoulders slightly forward. Now, It is very comfy like my 900 Vulcan was. Very good product.<br /><br />Now...be prepared to have he needed allen wrenches, metric of course, and be VERY VERY VERY careful with this product as it will scratch easily. (They tell you that in the instuctions sent with) I found that I needed to relocate my front brake line behind my triple trees...which ment I had to bleed the front brakes. Again...very good product and I will be recommeding them to fellow riders.Just be prepared to do more work than popping these bad boys and and rolling. Very important fact...read the instructions. : )
B004O844DS|5|great product made very well, easy to put together and install, great for small suv installed on a 2003 Toyota highlander
B00QQ092VG|2|Well made, seems durable. but brake lever will not fit my '08 R6, even if I could make it fit the piece is just not right, the one picture would likely do the job, but not  the one I got. It lacks the &#34;tip&#34;  that's supposed to push the brake fluid in. Don't know if you can tell the difference from the pictures but I included them in case it's of use for anyone
B003CJGR80|1|Bought to replace the clutch lever on my 01 KDX 200. Arrived and was excited to get the old curly q lever off and get the brand spanking new one on and give it a test run. So I get the old one off and take the new one out of the package to install. I find that the new one is much too thick to fit in the perch. I started the return process to find that I have to pay return shipping. After spending $5 for the label and my time to bring to UPS or USPS I have decided to bite the $10 bullet and trash it :)
B000EQ95OC|5|Fits perfect.. 1999 toyota 4runner v6
B005CO9Y9W|4|Ok product.
B00JT58QE4|3|Wrong size for what I needed
B001AVOKV8|5|Fits and works. Only con is that it is super heavy so it's not ideal for mini road racing. Should last quite a while.
B00P5YLLZY|5|Great, they were very needed
B00425QX8M|5|Much better than the plastic cap/tool than comes on a bottle of Slime when breaks easily.
B00I9XH1NO|4|It works  just takes a few minutes to install and comes with some diagnose software, that I did not use but looks ok the keygen for the software does come up as a virus because it's a keygen for a pirated program. I used scanXL Pro  and this worked on a 2006 f250 diesel 2008 jeep jk and a 2009 Mazda CX-9
B000RFSARI|5|This works great.  We are going to hook it up with a short hose to the faucet.<br />It hooks tight to out sewer hose no leaks.  This does a great job of cleaning the sewer hose.
B00EU7DV6Y|5|gave as a gift
B00CBXTBL8|5|Bought 3 pair of the &#34;old&#34; type (ones with pink stitching) Rode on back of our Harley to the 75th rally. We covered over 3900miles in 10 days. Our temps ranged from 109* to 33* on ride. These shorts kept the rash away wicked the moisture from my bum. Highly recommend now I'm not saying  my bum wasn't tired after that ride but these did what they are suppose to, keep moisture and rash away! 2 thumbs up made riding that many miles in that short a time more enjoyable...
B00QWVGSKW|5|Best product supper fast shiping and excellent seller 100%  satisfaction
B0085IJVBI|5|I was very pleased with the speedy delivery. The Ventmate fit perfectly
B011PCUCYK|1|This is only Ok product.  Small and not even fit my 2012 Honda Civic. So it is really not for Honda Cars but a shade with Honda logo. Good price for the shade.  I ended up use this on my 2009 toyota corolla.  Looks strange though.  After using this for two weeks, the black corners are not holding up the shape anymore.  I therefore adjust my review from three stars to one star.
B003BSB7PU|5|really helps to keep the drains fresh, I use it regularly, especially after the dump and drain
B0023UPORY|5|These cups work great for measuring paint or fiber resin or anything you have to measure. THANK YOU
B00KWMI5KS|4|Satisfied
B00N48OSQ2|5|excellent quality
B00TX3ZJ7E|2|These are not white.  They're blue.  If you are OK with blue lights (I'm 46 and do not want to look like a teenager going down the road) then by all means, get these.
B00GN2VROW|5|Easy installation.
B00UFQP0QS|5|Best wipes on the market.  Have one container in my garage and I use them daily.  I get so much garbage on my hands from playing around the garden, garage, yard, and basement that these wipes are a MUST.  I replaced my garage door opener and got covered in grease, lube, paint (dont ask me) and caulk and these wipes just cleared my hands off in seconds.  They are a must have for any garage and i am already looking forward to ordering another container!  I have yet to use the wipes on anything else but my hands and skin but I bet it does a heck of a job on cleaning off other material.
B008QEXV7G|5|Easy installation.
B0050EIUOY|5|Pleasant transaction excellant sale thank you
B00C7Q74N6|5|Not much better than Mahle original equipment pistons.  They came with the rings already installed!  Great price for great quality.
B004FJPS5Y|5|expected
B000HUM614|5|Great product
B000BYB1QM|4|thanks
B00X0LDGJI|5|I received the product and it matched the description exactly, I recommend buying from this seller!
B000C9JS66|5|It was a a OEM product as advertised worked great an a good price .
B000BPUTL4|5|I was a little unsure that this would work when I bought this and the hose to replace my old factory intake hose on my 2009 Chevy HHR that had many splits in it and making the car idle rough, but with a modification by drilling two small holes &#34;one up & one down&#34; at a cross angle over the inside fender wall air hole the whole assembly fit like a dream and the quality and appearance looks better than the OEM part for whole lot cheaper! And rough idle gone.
B00271ETX4|5|Every range bag  should have one.
B000CMD256|4|Works well
B000GVA5LM|2|What rockers?  Edit much?
B000M73Y22|5|Holds my two chainsaw and gas can More you need
B0002JM8PY|1|crap
B00ELHT3N8|4|Use this oil because it outperforms all other synthetics in the market.  Switched to this from Amsoil and have been satisfied.  Use it (in various weights) in my vehicles, boats, diesel tractor, home generator.
B000760FWU|5|Thank You!
B009OBVRY4|5|Great when working in small areas.
B00P03HO6U|2|They smell good but they are not strong once in the care
B002LFAP70|5|Sounds great, shipped fast great seller. Thanks!
B00VKXC5K4|5|These lights are very bright and match perfectly to a 6000k hid.
B000C53T9W|5|rides just like it did when new.
B001N2O3PM|5|Great product for the price. Looks classy and easy to install. Wonderfully priced and swift delivery.
B0019COQ6C|5|Great product!  Has had 2 other brands that did not hold up to expectations and only lasted a short time which was to me a severe waste of money.  So far this Lincoln 1162 is doing really good!  This is a must have tool for my husbands log truck since it is a weekly used tool!
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Looks great I am sure my husband will love it
B00D7N8HRK|5|excellent
B009AA2HDO|5|Replaced passenger side hub on 2007 Ford Explorer.  Still working good after 1 year.
B00ARUQRDW|3|Good fit just cheap flimzy plastic
B00BK7MX2U|5|GOOD.
B002NSGMHM|5|Bright little lights, I put them all on my girls scooter's for a taillight.  Visible from a long distance away, well built and sealed well.
B00DTVBBD2|5|Works well with the original cap
B00062ZDAO|3|They work, look pretty but they are plastic I was expecting metal. Didnt see any indication in the product description
B0053HOB96|1|Junk! As usual it's produced from Taiwan and as I should have expected the quality is not there don't waste your money trust me. If you're looking for quality go elsewhere if you're looking for something that's cheap and junky and no quality and overpriced purchase this. Very disappointing. I don't know who wrote good reviews on this piece of junk but they must have been under the influence of something when they did.
B00XAX4B9A|4|AlphaShade is fabulous, but was too small for my windshield (2016 Ford Escape).
B000B5QFE4|5|Fits perfect
B006OQ35GU|4|You have to have a clear view to ensure the flushing unit removed all debris.  This worked like a charm.  Only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't fit in the bumper.
B000C16XLC|2|fit my 2004 dodge Dakota club cab perfect. easy to install, update - 1 year later it broke , looks like others had same issue.
B00FS8365A|5|Worked perfectly as replacements for Jeep JK Backup Lights.  Requires cutting and splicing the OEM light housing.  See Pictures.  Google for detailed installation instructions in the Jeep forums.
B00KY41PNI|3|It's an okay sun shade. It fits my 2015 Corolla well but I thought it'd be a little better/snugger fit. I live in an area where it can get over 100 degrees F in the summer (with lots of humidity). It helps prevent the steering wheel from getting too hot to touch, but the inside of the car is still way too hot (I even have tinted windows). I suppose there's not much the sun screen can do if it's so hot though.<br /><br />I mostly bought this because I read reviews on the flimsier sun shades and I was worried about getting something that would fall apart in the intense heat. I've only had this sun shade for less than a month and it's holding up well. I guess in time I'll find out if it'll disintegrate like the cheaper ones but it doesn't seem like it will. It's pretty sturdy. That's good and bad. It does fold up, but it's still pretty big and bulky, which makes it difficult to store (unless you want to throw it in your back seat, but it might be hard to constantly get it from the back and throw it back there because it's not as flexible as the cheap sun shades).<br /><br />I bought this sun shade for just under $50. Would I buy it again? Maybe if it were half the price. I'm keeping it because it does work and it would be a hassle to return it. And I'm worried about a cheaper one turning into dust in the heat. If you live somewhere where it gets sunny but rarely gets over 100 degrees, then I probably would not get this sun shade. If you've had bad luck with the cheaper ones, maybe try this type. I'll be sure to update this review if this sun shade falls apart on me.
B000BGM89Y|5|This was everything advertised!  Quality construction!
B00AZOIV8O|5|I'm using these for my 2014 Honda Accord because I broke several during a stereo install. Fits great, tight, durable. The original is green and these are gray.
B001AWU6KQ|4|nice product
B00GHT7ZYM|5|Worked Great!
B003V5KKH4|4|Works well but build is a little flimsy.
B00H87W2TK|5|It was exactly what I expected thank you 5star
B00YD7U1HI|5|Product as described

B00EPA7BXU|5|Very bright
B00HCQYHYU|1|The water pump was scored across the mating surface, there was little chance that it would seal to the block. I returned it and bought another kit from my local auto parts store, where I could inspect everything before accepting.

B00029WSZO|4|Delivers just as promised.
B00GWFOPOE|5|good stuff
B002QAOBBQ|3|Works fine. A little more tape would have been nice. The fit is good.
B007V2ECU4|5|The window shade is exactly as pictured, custom fit for my vehicle (2007 Toyota FJ).  My girl friend recently bought a very nice sun shade for her Camry.  I was tempted to go with the same brand she did because it was $10 cheaper and hers is also a nice shade that you roll up rather than fold.<br /><br />I am thrilled with this one and she immediately commented on how nice it was too.  That is a huge compliment from someone who watches her pennies so frugally!<br /><br />The shade is nice and thick.  It folds and unfolds easily.  When folded, it lays flat on my backseat.  It is also custom fit for the odd shape of the FJ's windshield.  It doesn't need instructions, but it came with a helpful hint on how to slide it effortlessly into place.<br /><br />I am very glad I spent the few extra dollars for this product!
B00332GMKY|5|Great

B000CCOK48|5|Exactly what I needed
B00SS12RXQ|4|It may be chrome &#34;plastic&#34;, but accent the saddlebags very nicely. Be careful during installation - Once the adhesive touches something, it is there to STAY! Make sure you have the accents where you want it the FIRST time - No second chances!
B000H8U37A|5|This light module is indistinguishable from the OEM unit and it even comes with the light bulbs already installed! Looks good and works well.
B0079MKH6E|5|Nice addition. Easy Installation (once I figured out how to separate the old cap from the dipstick!
B0022XTDQA|5|Worked Perfectly. Easy to use. No attachments needed for my 1986 Yamaha Venture Royale XVZ1300cc v-max Entire proceedure took only ten minutes. Fantastic tool. It saves money and builds horsepower.

B003XFTUHI|5|Just love it.!!! Can't go wrong with this acquisition ..the balance between price style and quality is really good.!!!!
B006C26YCI|1|No ignition wire had to run an extra wire to my fuse box... Should really put that plain out in descpription
B000TYVKYM|5|Fit my 2002 Subaru Legacy perfectly. Was the same as my old one and easy to install as well
B00WM36XNG|5|Great product.
B000E0Z85I|5|This was an exact fit for my 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport. I had a difficult time finding the unit for my Jeep as there appeared to be several varieties that claimed to be compatible with the vehicle, most of which did not even resemble what I had. This fit well, installed easily, and appears to be working fine after proper system purging and charging per vehicle manufacturer's specifications.<br /><br />My only complaint, which I won't dock a star for, was the packaging. It was simply dropped in an oversized cardboard box rather than packaged securely in such a way that it wouldn't be damaged during transit. Mine arrived fine, thanks to Amazon's packaging, but the manufacturer could do a better job packing their products.<br /><br />The attached photo shows the accumulator off to the left in my Jeep's engine compartment.
B009CCM6CC|5|perfect fit easy to install
B00N2HQQ3I|2|I know they are labeled cotton flannel, but they sure don't feel like cotton.
B0070WAVNC|5|Fast shipping. The intake works and looks great, I can definitely feel the difference. Very easy instillation, just follow the YouTube video. Installed into a CA MINI, luckily it came with a CARB sticker to pass smog inspection.
B002M3KSK0|5|Perfect for my Volvo wagon - not too wide, very sturdy, and super easy to install.  Highly recommend.

B005GHB5U6|5|Badass looking face mask. Will be excellent for riding in cold weather. The nose underneath is fully cut out, although you wont be able to see that looking straight on at mask. Better breathing ability. Mouth has holes there, that you wont be able to see in the mask, but they are there. Also great for shooting practice in cold weather. I definitely recommend!! I wear my sunglasses under the mask. I am ver satisfied with this mask. Great price too!! I highly recommend!! Thank you.
B00XPL88NC|5|As described. Great piece of kit. Good price. prompt delivery. Courteous follow up by seller.
B000IYA6KM|4|Works great
B00029WRKU|3|Kinda tricky to put on the first time. In order to get the visual field you want, you really have to have to move them to the edge of the mirror- when you do this is makes them more susceptible to wind vibration.
B00CJA0QM6|4|Works great!
B00LNE0SPE|5|Just like original equipment.  I also installed a high output LED 1156 flat panel bulb.
B004ROPQ2C|3|The product look good quality but only came with u tire valve capts very disipointed
B00JFCAKZE|5|As expected worked great
B000NGPZRE|5|Fits the ZZ4 block under the stock black plastic timing cover.  Top gear IS the same GM part as the original that came with my fast burn crate motor.  Seems to be good stuff.  If all you need is the chain, I believe you can buy it separate and I&#34;m sure it would fit the original GM gears just fine.
B00EEMJBYQ|1|No it didn't because the top part that suppose to come off it won't so I don't have sticking to my window Cuz of the top part won't come off n when I do try n get it off the underneath won't stay sticking to the window it'll all come up
B008K3GS6O|5|perfect
B000C5BLZG|5|Fast delivery ,  no issues
B006R2RZOY|5|Nice bright light! A hundred times better than the stock dome lights in my GMT400 Suburban. Appears to be well made and fits the receptacle easily even with the extra width board. A much desired lighting upgrade and low power draw to boot!
B007G2IN04|5|works great
B003SOKEXI|5|Always nervous when ordering car parts but this worked out great!
B00FWNWT9A|5|Exact fit!
B00C3VSXL2|5|Great customer service! Looks great! Gives a new look to the rear end of my Yukon!
B00HR26X6O|1|I liked the way they look, but they are a little bit too bright for me. One night when I got In my Tahoe the lights turned on and they did not turn off when I closed the door. I couldn't drive like that so I had to take off all 6 of them. I didn't put them back on.
B000BZI4K2|5|Got rid of the yellow warning
B00BGDII90|5|Exactly what I needed..other than the bottle was dented..so it took a little extra effort to shake up the agitator ball inside..
B00G1RXJ0Y|3|Will Press in Bearings, not remove.  No Instructions included

B00EC101D4|5|Fits perfect
B001N1HEUO|5|This item was purchased as part of a first aid kit for my husband's workshop.
B000AY4NZO|5|Perfect. Exactly what we were looking for!
B000K004D8|1|This antenna didn't fix my 2005 Chevy Trailblazer at all. Now I'll have to return it.
B00HRHWHNW|5|Very sturdy and exactly what I need. Would highly recommend. Plus the price is right!!
B002FDEKTM|5|Easy to use and don't loosen up like metal on metal can sometimes do.  No corrosion and they look good.
B003VASDRS|5|great product
B000BZEIOS|5|easy install and ok price no brainer.
B00JGSZ49Y|5|Love this low profile trash container.  It is more flush to the seat than any aftermarket trash container and the strap that hooks to the bottom of the seat keeps it from flopping around.
B0002JSZ8I|5|Simply amazing. Cleans, polishes, and moisturizes. I've tried many other products and I always come back. I've been using this product for 5 years and my leather looks new. Love it
B0077T23IO|4|Decently constructed. First use, one of the rubber paddock stands chipped. It still holds the swingarm as it should, but I don't know how long these will hold up. Sturdy enough to hold the bike and me on it while adjusting suspension.
B00CG5RYEW|5|This was a perfect purchase I made for my husband. That is his personal trademark lol. He got a kick out of it, but he said he would probably get pulled over for having it on his car. I don't think so, and that was why I bought it to put on his car. Of course in an inconspicuous spot. It is humor not offensive at all. I love it. It is done in good taste for what it says ha ha.
B00RQMAOM4|5|He is looking for tail lights now!
B00QZHU0GQ|3|Not bad...you need to make sure they are tight and/or use zip ties on the end so they don't float of move to much.
B00IB1X73M|5|Very good product and very easy to install
B00O4BIRJM|5|Looks awesome ! I love it.
B00JBI8T32|1|These lights fit perfectly but is not an equal replacement because it only has 3 light bulbs. The product description is inaccurate to say the least.  On these, the turn signal place has an empty hole for a light bulb but no socket.  The instructions make you connect the turn signal wire to the halo so there's no running lights.  This is not legal in MD (and in many other states I suppose) and the car won't pass inspection.  Therefore, don't waste your money.
B00V52X7U2|5|Awesome. Great tool set.
B00J5CVMLU|5|It is very easy to use and it makes my Black Tesla P85D look better than when I took delivery.  Thanks
