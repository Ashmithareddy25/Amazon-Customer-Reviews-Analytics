B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  The author weaves a story that is interesting and not predictable.  A quick read that I especially enjoyed since I just visited Ireland and the places the story took place at.  The characters came alive to me.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Really unique. Build your personal perfect sounds and fall asleep to a different melody each night. Highly recommend. Developers did a great job. Exceeded expectations.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I've been a fan of LM since I first heard the music.  That doesn't disappoint on this Hollywood version.  However, HWood does what it always does; concentrates on stars and spectacularism rather than voices and production.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|So well written.  Such a strength in James where you wouldn't expect it.  Loved the integration of the Tao with his recovery

0790740443|4.0|If you never thought Kurt Russell was a good actor, you might want to take a look at this. A very dark and dreary vision of a possible future for mankind, strewn out among the stars where values are related to profit or military worth. The human condition is second to everything else.  Russell is a soldier that has been bred and trained from childhood to be hard and tough beyond compare, But when he is betrayed and discarded, he finds himself feeling some level of compassion for a community of dejected, discarded people, struggling to survive, who are being attacked and destroyed for sport by Russell's ex Marine comrades.<br />Kurt doesn't hardly say a dozen words, but tells more stories with a look than Zoolander. Not a fast paced action thriller, but well worth the time spent, this is a haunting look at what our future could be if we fail to retain our compassion for one another, and humanity in the choices we make.<br />Oh, and for the girls, Russell was at his physical peak here, and is quite impressive - especially if you can remember \\"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Minecraft PC and Xbox 360 edition so I hope to get this app soon! The only drawback is that it's realyyyy expensive. I'd still give it 5 stars tho, SO GO MINECRAFT!
1558908846|5.0|Have you seen the new Dredd, with Karl Urban? This is nothing like it. The new version of Dredd is dark, harsh and Karl only has about half a dozen lines. But this Dredd is like a light version, where you see more of a humorous script, interlaced with dark moments delivered by Armand Asante and Max Von Sydow. Stallone is Stallone, but it isn't quite Rocky - he does bring some believability to the character. Diane Lane does a good job as well, but really, this is a gem of a performance by Asante. Highly recommended!
B00785P2QC|4.0|One of the better games for the kindle fore. Great graphics, great concept and very much enjoyed. Highly addictive go download now!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|While the story is indeed interesting and well told, the scenes out on the pacific are breath-taking.  I do recommend this movie to those who are philosophical.

1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan has the amazing ability to take the mundane (corn, building a workshop, plant seeds) and make it fascinating. So it shouldn't come as a surprised that Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation could take something many of us take for granted and turn it into an incredible journey.<br /><br />Pollan opens the book by explaining the day that realized that all of the questions that occupy his time seem to lead back to cooking. How to improve your health? Cooking. Good way to connect with the family? Cooking (and brewing). The most important thing we can do to help reform the American food complex? Cooking. Pollan admits he has always been mildly interested in the act, but it wasn't until he realized how important it could be that he began wanting to learn how to do it in earnest. Pollan realized that though American's seem to be obsessed with cooking (Top Chef, The Taste, Anthony Bourdain, Hell's Kitchen) we seem to do very little of it.<br /><br />Pollan breaks down his education into four sections, much like he broke down The Botany of Desire and The Omnivore's Dilemma. The first section, called Fire, starts out at a North Carolina BBQ. It's here that Pollan strives to solve the mystery of \\"pig-plus-wood-smoke-plus-time\\" and what makes it so darn good. He spends time with pit-masters, learning the find art of the fire, which involves everything from Freudian theory, ancient gods and the Bible to chemistry and, of course, Big Meat. Before his fire education will be over, the reader will journey with Pollan to Manhattan, Berkeley, Spain and back again.<br /><br />From there we dive into Water, which starts out, inexplicably, with chopping onions. As any home cook knows, onions are a basic element of cooking, but did you ever consider what evolutionary advantage onion tears could possibly have for the onion? In this section, Pollan tackles water in a seven-step recipe that walks through copping, saut&eacute;ing, browning, braising and finishing. But of course, this being Michael Pollan, nothing is quite that simple. While learning about braising the reader also gets an education in chemistry and the mystery of umami.<br /><br />On to Air, which is all about baking. Pollan breaks down bread into its most pure form \\"an ingenious technology for improving the flavor... of grass.\\" Here we learn about evolution and, as Pollan spends his time with master bakers, fermentation. Any other author might have trouble linking such disparate ideas as bacteria and engineering, but this section ambles easily between the two ideas. Pollan doesn't spend all of this time in his home kitchen mastering the art of crumb and crust, however, and he takes us from the blue surf waves of the ocean to the industrial Hostess plant all in the name of understanding air (can I have his job?).<br /><br />Finally, we come to earth, or \\"Fermentation's Cold Fire.\\" As you would imagine, it is here that Pollan turns his eye to vegetables and animals, but the section starts out with death. Bacteria, mold and even Jello gets its due as Pollan takes us into the garden and into the soil for making kimchi. From there we head to the dairy farm where we learn about milk and its more popular big brother, cheese. Pollan works along side cheese master Sister Noella in Connecticut, learning the amazingly intricate ins and outs of cheese creation. This section is also the one in which Pollan address alcohol, which is right at home among the vegetables, it turns out. The story of beer and spirits is one of biology, of course, but also history and culture.<br /><br />In the end, this isn't just a book about learning to cook, nor should it be considered an addendum to The Omnivore's Dilemma. Though Pollan tackles some of the same issues (health, agribusiness and the human body), Cooked is the retelling of a journey. And the opportunity to meet these culinary superstars is wonderful, but it is only a fraction of the story. Of course there is the requisite finding of the satisfaction of making your own foods, but the bigger aspect is the author and reader's education in the nature of the world and of human culture. Whether you are familiar with Pollan's previous work or not, this is a must read for anyone who is even remotely curious about the world around us.isfaction of making your own foods, but the bigger aspect is the author and reader's education in the nature of the world and of human culture.

B00AHTYI5M|2.0|I like actor/writer/editor/whatever celebrity Affleck. He's sure has a nice image. But ARGO is a tension-less, toothless semi-dramatized docu-dramatic piece of fluff.<br /><br />When compared to Jamie Fox's 2007 film of THE KINGDOM [[ASIN:B0013IFHA6 The Kingdom]] my rating slipped from three to two stars. Argo is flat lifts of media clips of the operation, only simplified Disney-fashion cardboard to become dull renditions of the story.(THE KINGDOM showed<br />a very different aspect of how the Mid East works). Showed it elegantly and entertainingly too.<br /><br />Argo is stolid description, not drama. R-rated? It's<br />far more G-rated for its flat antiseptic presentation.<br /><br />THE KINGDOM is Real, scary, involving, believable, impact-ful, being beautifully produced (with authentic plot/people/motivations, acting, situations, frustrations, action and true to life Saudi attitudes and locations. It's so much better than ARGO.<br /><br />From now on I'll see an Academy Award<br />as a kiss of death in movie quality.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|it is awesome loved it thank you so much its fantastic & i was excited to get it thanks again
B004LP3AYI|3.0|I loved the first book. This one was so long and draw out it was difficult to hold attention. My daughter is reading the same series and is going through the same thing. This Book is a hard one to get through but it gets better on book three.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Excellent book... Lots of action, monsters, triumphs, and decisions that needed making...Can't wait to read Mark of Athena and learn how the \\"Prophecy of Seven\\" will be made and if there is peace between the two camps.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It was put on our Kindle, but disappeared.  I would very much like to get it back. Can you help?
B001E25MBK|2.0|The movie is perfect, but Spanish subtitles are not available for movie, just in the additional disc.<br />It comes with subs even in turkish! but no Spanish. Bad!
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Saw ghost live in concert with opeth and it was an excellent show. The bands first album@ was awesome this is a good followup
0920668372|3.0|Absolutely love the book! It was my favorite growing up, but I just wasn't happy with how it was packaged. It arrived all bent up and took quite a while to arrive!
B008OOYALE|5.0|its a cute game that becomes addictive. for us with O C D lol.  kids love watching the new dragons hatch.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I FEEL this book was helpful in making it easier to connect with people BY giving easy topics to start a conversation with anyone.
B00942S4OY|4.0|The CD came exactly as promised and was in new condition, playing very nicely and exceeding in all the expectations that I had. The only thing I would have to say negative about the product was the delivery, which took about a month or so to actually reach my house. Other than that, the product was perfect!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This CD is great! I do appreciate that the went back to rock and roll and less poppy music.  I like the Featured artists and I could listen to the songs all day.  I don't like slow songs, but the slower songs are even good.  Just an all around good album.  I also appreciate the fact that they went old school by putting the lyrics in the cd case.  I haven't seen that in a while, not that I often buy cds but still.  I like the cover art, and the disk art.  It is good.
B000069AUI|5.0|I had ordered this album for my dad, and needed it shipped quickly before Christmas. I loved that the CD came quickly and exactly when the seller had promised, arriving just in time for Christmas Eve. Additionally the CD was in new condition, played just fine, and included all the materials that should come with a CD, including the lyric book and such. Great buy!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a great read!  This book was everything a book should be.  It was entertaining, super suspenseful, educational, realistic...  Kidding!  I have never been so intrigued by chemistry!  Not to mention that fact that I love Mark!  We would totally be friends.  There was a lot of clever writing and unique story telling.  Even 95% into the book, I wasn't sure how it would all end.  Kudos!  One of the best books I've read all year and it was $0.99!
B00CATONCA|5.0|I've followed The Walking Dead TV show since day 1, and recently caught up on the comics. By far one of my favorite series and despite the negativity spreading around about seasons 3 and 2, they are all well written and sick episodes. I enjoy every one and can't for the premiere of season 4 in October.<br /><br />The Season 3 LE looks amazing with the floating heads, and from what I've read, they actually float! Anyone know if the case itself actually lights up or is that just for effects in the picture? Either way, awesome LE case, awesome show, can't wait.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I've heard a lot of people knock invicta, but I don't know why. This watch looks just like a Rolex Daytona! My dad has a Rolex and he couldn't tell the difference from across the table himself. The watch has got the right amount of weight to it, the clasp is nice and secure, and case and the buttons seem to pretty watertight. I almost went with the same watch but with a black face, but ended up picking this one. No regrets, the white looks great with everything from dress clothes to shorts and a t shirt. It looks great and the case is the perfect size.<br /><br />I got my watch 2 months ago and wear it almost every day. Love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read a lot of Nicholas Sparks books and I love them all, but this book I love so much it made me cry. It has Sparks sweet dreamy romance with a twist. Book keeps you guessing whats going to happen next. Simply amazing as always
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thank you to this author for writing such great stories.  I just read Slammed and Point of Retreat, and was worried this would not be as good.  Boy was I wrong. Not only was it great, it left me feeling every emotion possible. I was embarrassed, happy, elated, turned on, heartbroken, relieved, healed, mad, and in love.  Just to name a few.  And it just kept getting better chapter after chapter.  And Edward Cullen? Nope. Christian Grey?  Travis Maddox? No thanks. I will take Dean Holder any day of the week.  He is an amazing man. And just what Sky needs.  Everyone needs to read this.  Just keep in mind, it does deal with some pretty heavy and deep subject matter, but it is so worth the journey.  You will laugh, cry, and fall in &#34;live&#34;.  Thank you Mrs. Hoover!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Nice game to relax with. Great sound and graphics. Can see any age group playing. I have this on my lap top and tablet
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I downloaded the Facebook app for my Kindle Fire HD. It doesn't work correctly. I cannot use the Poke function, especially if there are multiple people to respond to. Every time I &#34;poke&#34; someone, the remaining people shift to the left. After poking two people, they have shifted so far left, I cannot see the rest of the people or click on the options anymore. There are other flaws, too many to mention. Enough to where I don't use my Kindle Fire to do Facebook.
0545305497|5.0|I love the Hunger Games Trilogy! Very addicting, I didn't want to put it down. Of course the books are better than the movie =)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It worked perfectly and i was able to put a nice sharp edge on my knife. Would definitely recommend getting one if you have a dull knife.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blitz is a must have for bingo lovers...I would recommend this to anyone who loves to play bingo...a must have...Gray on kindle fire
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just love this whole series  it is amazing. I don't know what<br /> I would do without it.  I love the hunger games!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|In general you don't expect much from a 0.99 book but I was pleasantly surprised (actually blown away - one of the better reads in a while).  An amazing read and I look forward to reading more from this Author.
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|There is nothing here that hasn't been done before and better.  The album cover speaks for itself, old and boring. it seems that Eric Clapton is just going to sit back and let someone else make music.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This movie got awards for a reason. Its really good. So many great artists and songs through out. Loved it!
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This is a cult classic and I guess I am in the cult. Especially since I got a bigger TV. The claustrophobic feel of this movie is greatly enhanced on a bigger screen. Not much else to say - if you want it all buy this.
B005EJNAK4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was a great concept and well executed. I enjoyed Bruce Willis in his typical &#34;action cop&#34; character but with an important twist. There were some interesting plot twists and turns and overall just enjoyed the movie. It's not a complex puzzle to solve but more of a science fiction action thriller that is fun to watch.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Highly recommend this Connelly thriller as its cut from the same engaging, entertaining mold that's served us readers so well.
1932735410|5.0|Worth every penny spent on this book. Very useful for  PMP exam for most of the questions in addition to pmbok.
034580404X|5.0|I read a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey a friend had. I loved it so much that I bought the three book set. I do own two Kindles but I had to have it hard copy. The books were packaged well, arrived fast and I'm already finished with the second and started the third this morning.<br /><br />I just can't seem to put it down. I'm glad that there was more to the story than BDSM, but it's worth every minute. Try it, you might like it!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This product is exactly as advertised. Great bettery life and just what I needed to keep my Motorola Bionic charged when an outlet is not around. Price was half of other chargers, great value.
0425252868|5.0|Adam Makos has captured the essence of the &#34;Greatest Generation&#34; in the story of two pilots -- one a German Me-109 fighter pilot and one an American B-17 bomber pilot. They met over Germany and their legendary encounter is wrapped in the events that brought them together, sent them their separate ways for several decades and then brought them back together as friends and, quite literally, comrades in arms. Minor technical flaws do not detract from a great story, well told. The ultimate thanks go to Lt Charlie Brown of the AAF and Flt Lt Franz Stigler of the Luftwaffe for telling their stories so well.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The headphones themselves are amazing - they're comfortable, the wireless worked fine for me, and the sound quality was superb. In fact, when I was setting them up, I thought they were not working as it sounded like the sound was coming from my stereo speakers, but in fact it was coming from the cups.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my experience was marred by the horrible quality microphone. The mic is capped at 16khz, which is very low quality for vocals. While this may be fine for some programs, even in Skype/etc the quality is notable. For actual vocal recordings - commentaries, podcasts, etc - you can forget about it.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that if you record your voice using Adobe Audition, your playback and recording qualities have to be at the same level, meaning you not only have to record at 16khz, but you have to playback at 16khz too. Needless to say, this is a horrible experience.<br /><br />After discovering many wireless headsets have this problem - due to wireless bandwidth limits, sending/receiving high-quality audio and recording high-quality mic seems to be technologically impossible right now - I've decided to switch back to a wired headset.
1452115567|5.0|Photography is outstanding and the subject, Maddie, is beyond adorable. Makes me smile and I love the relationship between subject, guradian and photographer. Lovely!
B009VMN3RA|4.0|It was entertaining. I just wonder how Shirley McLaine could be so cold at times with her daughter. She had so much but was unwilling to share it with her. I can understand letting your children make their own way but that was carried to the extreme. I have no respect for her as a mother.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Does not work on my Coby Android Tablet.  Screen id full of gibberish. I like Opera on my laptop but I cvant use it here
B008476HBM|4.0|This is a good book to read or reread when all other good books at hand have been read,  or  the reader  needs the comfort of something familiar,undemanding and charming.
6300248569|5.0|Got this as a replacement for my 100 year old mother. She had totally worn out her previous set. This one worked like a charm and brought a huge smile to her face!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The following of a family through turbulent and changing time leading to and following WWI  is a history lesson in fashion, social and political history.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|good app for reading, but kindle is much better. I have read 4 books and feel it really good. i love it
B00011D1OA|5.0|It is beyond rating this wonder. The Lyrics, music, acting, costumes, are superb without doubt, question or comparison. It has earned all the awards it gathered.
0425263908|5.0|Having read all 3 of the 50 shades books-I find that Bared To You puts 50 Shades in the shade!  Read this one, read the 2nd in this series and cannot wait for the 3rd one to be published in June.  Much more interesting story-well written and holding the reader's attention at all times.
B0007939NO|5.0|A perfect sentiment for troubled souls and times. For those seeking something different. The dancing, ideas and songs are reflective of s longing for a simpler life.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|it is definately a good time. I love all cut the rope games. relaxing after a long day and the kids love it too
B002361MLA|5.0|Enlightening giving new outlook on your inner being and accepting what is. Recommend too all, believe everyone will benefit from reading The Power of Now.
1847879071|4.0|Great book.<br /><br />It will help anyone who would like to know more how to use SPSS and also Statistics with great examples.
B0091THRCU|5.0|We bought this case for my husband's phone, and he loves it. The iphone 5 fits snugly inside, and is well protected. The faux leather doesn't even look cheap, it looks clean and professional.<br />The ONLY thing that is a slight issue: it only holds 2 cards. It would be beneficial if it held at least 3 (drivers license, CC and insurance...).<br />Overall it's a great product for the price. My husband even showed it off to a colleague, and the colleague bought one as well.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|Awesome wonderful to listen too i listen to this album everywere i go in the car in the shower in the gym its just wonderful
B008P9M614|5.0|Awesome price and speedy shipping! If you love House I defiantly recommend buying this box set, it comes with everything even bonus material.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|A great selection of songs some of which are different recordings making this really an enjoyable set. I recommend it highly if you are a Stills fan.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|To all those suffering from post-potter depression, here's the series that will help you transition to other books. All your Harry Potter fetishes are here. Orphan boy goes off to wizard school? Check. Said orphan boy lacks family but makes up for it in ability and friendship? Check. Sadistic teacher who hates the hero with a passion? Pair of friends with unending loyalty? Check check. There's a kindly Dumbledore-esqe headmaster and a half-mad teacher who would make Luna Lovegood uncomfortable. Point is, you're going to be comfortable. Good news though, it's not exactly a Harry Potter clone, so it never gets boring. The whole wizard school stuff is pretty much over in the second book, allowing you to to take off the training wheels and experience some good old fantasy adventure.<br /><br />Speaking of training wheels, this isn't a series overprotective mothers will approve of their 12 year olds reading. There's some heavy stuff here. Rape, drug addiction, torture, poverty, it's all covered by various degrees. There's even quite a bit of sex in the second book. However it isn't just some scandalous content that will make this book appeal to mature audiences. Practicalities and real world problems play a big role in this book of magic and fantasy. The protagonist doesn't have a pile of gold in Gringotts bank, in fact he's absolutely destitute. You'll see how entertaining and enthralling it is to see your Harry Potter going to a cutthroat loan shark to be able to pay next semester's tuition. And for those who loved Harry Potter's infrequent romantic endeavors, you'll find something much more substantial in this series. The love interest in this book is mysterious and troubled and her relationship with Kvothe is a fantastic mixture of puppy love and... well, we'll see.<br /><br />Read this book. Right now. Do it, you won't regret it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|If you love Barbra you will love this album.<br />Songs that are new to her collection that we all have.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Confirmation that love is all that matters. The message of the universe is clear. God is love and all are one.
B0015519VS|3.0|CD kinda boring. Sorry usher. A lot of long love ballads. I don't hate love songs but this wasn't his best work.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It's ok but why bother since Kindle has such a great email app and you can get all of your yahoo accounts in it.
B004MPESSY|5.0|Good remake of the original.  Hard to watch at times due to the graphic nature of it but I thought Sarah Butler was excellent.
B000000WFZ|4.0|Makes me want to see the movie again.<br /><br />I boght this just for the first track which is spellbinding. The clarinet snaps your nicker-elatic! Fantastic!<br />Coupla other tracks not so good. Definitely a good buy.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|This movie has been one of my son's favorite movies since it first came out.  It arrived quickly and in good shape.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is fun but it gets boring fast. It is a lot better then the first one though.You should get it if you are new at your device it is a good start.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A book that gives you hope where there was heartbreak, sorrow, uncertainy of how life were to play out  for one, who even as an adult doesn't have the power  to make things better.<br /><br />Cbornn
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|&#34;Lincoln&#34; had an Interesting story and was very well acted. Didn't fall asleep during it...which is always a good review.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|It's small and easy to loose but the powerful magnets and ability to re-use my older chargers more than makes up for it. A must-have. Made with the usual apple attention to detail and quality.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|With just a glance I can now tell battery charge. A few taps and I have battery health, battery usage, amount of time I can expect on the current charge for reading, game play, web surfing, radio, etc. I absolutely am glad I found this app. 5 Stars from me !!!  :)  I'm a happy camper !!!
B0006GQMC8|1.0|I know this move, I own the VHS tape. This is a good movie and good storyline. I was very disappointed in this DVD movie. At $29.00 I would expect a top quality disc, This disc resembled a poorly made home duplicated / copy; dark with screen flutter all the way through. Very distracting, took away from the Bronson / Marvin storyline. While this did not appear to me a commercial retail product, the quality of this disc could be the reason they did not do very well when they were released in the DVD retail market years ago; and  are so hard to find now. Recommend if you want to watch this movie, get a used one. I would not recommend this copy to anyone, even if it was $1,00 with free shipping.

B00BG4UWPC|5.0|I absolutely loved this album! I love how Phoenix had this streaming on ITunes a week before they released it. I was going to buy it anyway, but I respect the fact that they had it for free, this made me want to buy it even more.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this album!
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|If you like electronic/industrial music, this album is fantastic. It's like a less angsty, more synthetic, finer-tuned version of NIN. The vocals are still pretty simple-minded, but at least Mariqueen can sing. You can also really hear Atticus's influence, I think -- if you liked Ghosts I-IV or the soundtrack work he did with Trent (e.g. The Social Network), you will dig this album.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Great classic musical. Great music and acting.  LOVE MS. STREISAND.  Never get tired of watching this movie.  Can watch it over and over and over!!!!
B008UG0IS0|5.0|I pre-ordered &#34;Move&#34; when I found out it was available several weeks before release.  I was not disappointed.  I received it a day or two before it was available in the stores and was issued a partial refund for a price difference the same day.  Well done, Amazon!<br />This is Hiromi's second effort with Jackson and Phillips and is another display of technical brillance, creative composition and LOTS of practice and preparation.  You can tell these artists leave no measure unpolished and the spectacular lyricism is  evident in a measured and orderly arrangement.  The virtuosity of these musicians is impeccable.  The mixing and miking in the studio is obviously in the same category, lending a clarity to the sound that is a delight to hear.<br />Hiromi is such an adept composer/musician that the first several listenings to her recent work require studied attention.  This is not background music!  The more I listen, the more I hear and appreciate her artistry.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|everything's perfect, the packaging and also the quality of the disc...you won't be disappointed...you have to buy this set for real..
B007DIQC90|3.0|This came with some Mumford and Sons CDs.  My daughter loves it.  I haven't listened to the whole thing yet but the first few bars indicate it is music for a different taste then mine.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|i love the idea about animation with family theme...there's not much to say but if you miss a laugh or imagination, please watch this movie...
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It's convenient to have the app on my Kindle Fire but I usually just use my web browser because I have been having too many issues with the app.  I have had issues with uploading photos (told it uploaded successfully but no picture ever appears), with bad network connections (even though everything else that requires internet works just fine at the time), and I don't know how many times I have liked or commented on a status only to find out that it didn't post. I will be happy to update my review at a later time if these glitches ever get fixed but for now it's a disappointment.
B001G8XON0|5.0|it came up as an unusual story with mashed up popular songs....but it flows beautifully and everytime i watch the movie and listen to the songs, they are always spellbinding....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy having this app on my Kindle Fire.  You can just read as you please or choose from the many plans (devotionals, bible-in-a-year, etc) that this app offers. You can also customize the look of it and choose to set reminders to read daily if you want. It's a great app.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|i always love the music from moulin rouge movie...everything that involves the work and art of baz luhrman is sure not to miss
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I love this movie. It's fun, upbeat, and a definite classic in my book.  I enjoy the characters and storyline and watch it any time I need a pick me up.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it! ONLY BINGO GAME I play now. Easy to play, fun rooms.<br />Great chat..everyone likes to help others finish collections.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great free app! I have never had any problems with it on my Kindle Fire and the game is fun.
0439023483|1.0|Fond of self-centered, moody, spiteful, brainless, ungrateful teenagers? Read this series, 'cause this heroine's just right for you. By the time we get to the 3rd tedious volume where President Coin schemes to turn Katniss into a martyr for the revolution, I'm not the only one thinking, \\"Right on! Great idea!\\"<br /><br />I can't believe I read the whole thing. All three books, out of curiosity about all the hype. Hoping against hope that some gems of wisdom or good writing would appear. Sigh.<br /><br />Scholastic publishes the books and they are clearly marketed as \\"young adult\\", but I didn't realize the author is a teenager, too. Must be, given her weak writing style, one-dimensional characters, simplistic plot, vicious civil war with thousands of casualties yet seems distantly antiseptic, and a lack of the creativity that the current science fiction market demands. The people-hunting-people-for-sport meme is an old one, both in the real world (e.g., the Romans) and literature through the ages. \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", written in the 1920's and famous for the fictitious \\"Malay mantrap\\", is probably the best-known. Ms Collins' version just doesn't measure up.<br /><br />In her portrayal of a spoiled teenage girl's approach to life and those around her, though, Ms Collins is a virtuoso. Somehow, our heroine manages to be \\"betrayed\\" by every one of her benefactors, even as they try to keep her alive. She lives in her own fantasy world where everything is about her. She never has a simple disagreement with anyone, but manages to \\"hate\\" everyone in turn and repeatedly, especially the two boys who inexplicably fawn over her and do their best to keep her alive in spite of her spurning them. The positive attributes that have turned her into the heroine of Panem are hard to fathom: really good with bow and arrow, brave (foolhardy, really), and . . . let's see . .  umm. Her metamorphosis into the revolution's icon is entirely the work of those who surround her, most of whom get killed while supporting her unworthy and ungrateful person.<br /><br />Sheesh. What a waste of a three day's reading time. At least they're a quick read. One book's-worth, really, stretched into three. Save your money.
0061703257|5.0|Wow, I could not put this book down until I finished it. I had finals to study for but it didn't matter, I was hooked! Don't compare this to the movie, there's not comparison. Give the book a shot, it blows the movie out of the water.  It was well written, suspenseful, and the ending still has me thinking.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Unnecessarily foul language and crude humor made this movie simply dumb. Add to that the depressing characters with few redeeming qualities and it really wasn't worth the time.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|dave grohl has created a movie that not only goes into music history, but goes into the personal side of it all and really makes you care about this studio and all the people involved.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|LOVE BINGO BLITZ!!!! I play it everyday. Saves me money from going to play at casino!! And have made lots of friends!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have received this item.it is very great,i like it very much.it is very convenient.i will suggest my friend to buy it if they need.
0345525558|4.0|The characters were all united by the meanings of flowers.  Most struggled with enormous difficulties and their resolutions were a challenge to accept.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game rocks. Do not get confused with dragon story. I give this a 4 star because there should be more ways to get gems. But a great game and graphics. The prices for items are fine
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very pleased with the backpack.  Fits all my camera items nicely with room to spare!  Backpack appears to be well made and I expect it to last a long time.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I purchased this dvd because I did not get to the theater while it was showing.  I enjoyed it very much.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|loved the books, thought series was well made and stayed in character and plot with the books. hate author for not copleteing series. shame on him,still waiting
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I saw JT perform all week on Jimmy Fallon's show and enjoyed the music and the performance.  From there, I ordered his CD and the rest of the music doesn't disappoint.  I believe that seeing him sing these tracks shows how much he cares about his music and that he is having fun while doing it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is great game in which you can care for a horse and enter competitions. It is laggy sometimes and the advertisements are annoying, but still a great game nonetheless
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Great App!! My downloaded albums to Picasa are quickly available to view off my tablet. No problems and very easy to use. Well worth the minimal cost!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I got into it late thanks to Prime having it available free for subscribers.  I watched the first season pretty quickly and then totally breezed through the second too and I paid for that one!  I will say though in both seasons, there were times I had to turn away from the TV because things were too gross to watch.  I love the acting though.  Jessica Lange is wonderful, and the young actor Evan Peters was great to watch.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This author was recommended recently.  I feel I have missed not finding her sooner.  I'll definitely read more of her books.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Really my favorite show in a while.  I love the acting and the twists in the plots.  Jonny Lee Miller is quirky, funny, sexy and intolerable sometimes.  Lucy Liu is great...I really like her in this role.  It's just a good show all-around.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Love all of his books.  Definitely hold your interest and love his Camel Club.  Hope he continues to write for a long time.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The story line did not live up to the expectations of the first book. The pace was slow and less imaginative. The narration was one of the worst, there was more emotion from automated telephone calls. Good start, lousy ending.
0316227706|5.0|Underwater dogs is such a fun book to have!  The photos are absolutely incredible!  Ever wonder what your dog might look like when swimming?  Get this book and find out!
B009X01C64|5.0|I Absolutley Love it. This case is fantastic. After reading the reviews I was a little worried when some said it was hard to turn or hard to put kindle in or out but decided to take a chance...and Wow I am so happy I did. I have had no problem turning it from portrait to landscape. It was a little hard to snap it in place but I don't plan on taking it in an out of case  (and I know it won't fall out) I Highly recommend.
0679805273|5.0|Beautiful, fun, classic book that is fun to read for all ages!  My 3-year old daughter loves it, as do I.
B000VZR75K|4.0|Truly the 70's party machine music. God of Thunder and Shout it Out Loud still make me want to rebel. Truly s powerful classic production.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is the best game on my kindle and so is survival craft. everybody should get this game it the bomb.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a great game!! It was challenging and required you to think in different ways than the typical puzzle adventure games do these days. I wished it lasted longer, but that's only because I want more game to play. Totally worth the price! Can't wait for the next installment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game and highly recommend it. has many new features if you got noted with the first one there is no way you will get bored with this one. pump up the graphics and get to running.
B005IQZB14|4.0|That I read this book at all was quite by happenstance.  My son was showing me how to download books from the library to my iPad and he had just finished reading it.  It sounded like something he would like....but I was amazed that I loved it!  I was so taken by it that I could hardly put it down, couldn't wait to pick it up again.  Beautifully written.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love the show...entertaining and clean, something that you usually don't find much of! Will continue to watch and hope for it to continue!
B0074JODP8|5.0|Super music with a super Band and Super Guests. I Love It! If you get a chance to, buy this, watch it, and pass it on!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I like this app very much. I have a lot of fun with it. The only thing I have found is that although it asks me of I want to access my FB pic's it never goes to them. Otherwise it is a great tool to use for your pictures.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Suspenseful till the very end.  Not much for this genre but thought I would give it a try.  Loved it in the end!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Another series on par with the Cal Leadros series by Rob Thurman.  Again I was hooked after the first chapter and had to immediately download all of the available books in the series.  Druids are so cool and the books are adventurous, heartwarming and hilarious.
B0026RLM8O|5.0|of course I have this on vinyl, but I had to get the cd at a great price to load to my ipod.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site has great ideas for those that want to be creative and be thankful to those who thought about.  I learned from other users on the website for great cooking ideas.
0062059963|5.0|Spoiler Free Review<br /><br />What I loved most about this book:<br />1. Maxon. Duh.<br />2.The action.  We only got a small taste of the rebel attacks and fights in The Selection, but we get a bigger look in The Elite.  Cass took a risk with this book and made it darker and grittier, and it totally paid off.  I was on the edge of my seat during these scenes.<br />3. The love triangle.  Usually in a love triangle, I have my favorite picked from the beginning.  But The Elite made me cheer for both sides of the love triangle which a fun change from most other love triangles in YA.<br />4. The cover is absolutely gorgeous!<br />5. The supporting characters.  Every character is so well written, from America's family to the maids, to Celeste (even though she's kind of clich&eacute;, I absolutely love to hate her).<br />6. This book will make you have so many emotions.  There are many funny lines that had me laughing out loud.  On the other hand, I was almost in tears multiple times.<br />7. America. She's a great, well written character.  I really like that she has her own set of faults and flaws as well as strengths.  Sometimes she goes back on her word and has a hard time making decisions, but she always remains true to herself and does what she thinks is best.<br /><br />The Elite was a well written sequel that I had to read in one sitting because I literally could not put it down.  It was full of unexpected twists and turns, action, romance, and suspense.  I know that many second books are mediocre, but that is not the case here.  Everything about The Elite was better than The Selection.  Definitely pick this book up if you liked The Selection.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this on my tablet to check the weather where my granddaughters are great to know the weather and their location.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 3 year old grandson plays this game.  It is a lot of fun.  My husband enjoys playing it also.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|cute movie for girls and women who are always wondering if a guy they meet likes them. he will do anything if he like you and that takes the wondering out of it.
B005R32L66|4.0|I was really surprised that it did so well on my &#34;off brand&#34; tablet.  I would recommend it,no problem, thanks.
B00125JP1C|5.0|great action movie; some violent scenes of killing men with carrots and some nudity and cursing but, it is rated R, what do you expect? Fun movie.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This is a free game and it is awesome I do recommend this awesome game it is great and it is really fun I give it five stars although the stirring is a little bit hard to work but it is awesome again you will like it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Story teller did an amazing job. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well-written!  Character development, story development, plots within the plot are all carried out beautifully. The storyline suspense is incredible!  I couldn't put it down!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is very clear and not confusing at all! There aren't any ads that I know of and the little notices are very polite! :D Its actually really awesome!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I liked this book, it is action, interesting story line, kind of book you can't stop reading until you are done with it all.
B0096MM9GG|2.0|Not enough instructions on how to play it.  To someone new learning this type of game, more instructions aredefinitlely needed until you know how to play it.  Give more detailed tips while learning to play the game.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|So I really do love this movie.  It's not The Godfather, of course, but it's fun.  My kids like it, and I seem to like it more with each viewing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Fantastic, a must read! I highly recommend this book. The writing is so full of detail that you know each character.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft but it loses my worlds and it disinsalles it's secluded !!!! it is a pain in my button
0062059963|3.0|Take the concept of a reality show and add a pinch of dystopian class structure and you have this series.<br />The Bachelor for teenagers.<br />It is written in a very simplistic manner.It lacks the gritty substance of a YA and is geared stylistically more towards young teens and indeed I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to readers age 13 plus.<br />It is filled with the fantasy of young girls. Pretty dresses and handsome boys vying for the heroines attention.<br />Unfortunately she seems to be just a tad on the fickle side and the content of the book is a long extended game of the following. Oh Maxon likes me, wait a minute Aspen is really kind of cute, Maxon likes me, oh no wait a minute no he doesn't, uhm Aspen is cute...errm Maxon might like me?<br />Fair enough younger readers and YA/Teen category lovers will probably adore it.<br />I think the author needs to be careful not to let the series become too predictable. The next book will eliminate two more girls and so on. Whatever essence of faux fantasy life attracted readers to the first book is slowly starting to dissipate in this second one.<br />I received a copy of this book via NetGalley.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Not very far into this one but I love these stories and expect to love the next books as well.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Love this movie, and every time I listen to these music, it brings me back to the theater again.<br />Love Javert and Eponine's voices.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|wow this book was truly amazing. though a little confusing, my well educated thirteem yar old mind could easily undertand and see how great this book was:)
B008CJ0KJ2|5.0|Another gorgeous and inspired album by the venerable Calexico. I bought the vinyl LP, which came in great packaging and is pressed on flat, quiet vinyl. The production, as usual, is lovely. This grows on you the more you listen. Beautiful work.
B0011HOEYY|5.0|Still have yet to watch this film.  But I was buying every film I ever wanted at the time and I saw this copy.  Great price.
B008C20TDG|4.0|Good balance between science, personal experience, and tough love straightforwardness. For those considering this life style change it will be difficult but so worth it!
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Cheap copy of a very interesting vampire flick made by a disgusting pedophile starring one of the Manson family victims.  Very weird watching this film with the connections but it's a quirky little vampire flick.
0756405890|5.0|I happened upon this wonderful book at library book sale. I picked it up for $1 and didn't think much else about it for a few months until I ran out of things to read and decided to give it a try. I only wish I had read it sooner.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is a beautifully written story of a boys life that is told by his adult self while in the midst of yet another story wrapping about his present self. You are easily drawn into both story lines and always wondering what will happen next. So much happens from the first page to the last that you are rarely bored, but at the same time you are not rushed either. Rothfuss's timing is superb and only gets better with his next book.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting the book down once I started and seem to be having the same problem with his sequel A Wise Man's Fear. I can only suggest that you take the time to read this wonderful story. I expect great things from Rothfuss in the future.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|This is absolutely still the best Batman flick.  Bale is the 2nd best Batman, Keaton absolutely crushed the role.  And Tim Burton's view is so perfect.  I know the most recent trilogy is excellent, but not better than this, especially Nicholson's Joker.
0756407125|5.0|Once again I am thrilled with Rothfuss and his ability to bring such depth to such a story. He may have taken a while to do it, but the story is all the better for it. I laughed a lot more in this book and cried too. He managed to pull at my heart strings a dozen times in so many different ways I just couldn't believe it. I believe that it is a must read for all fantasy book fans!
B001CW7ZXK|5.0|How can you not love this movie.  Needed a copy of it, and why not go with an incredibly priced 30th anniversary edition.
B000NH7SZ0|4.0|I figured extra memory would be the best way to get large pic to print quicker.  I have not really noticed any improvement, though I must say I don't print many large pics.
B000NHQLPS|5.0|Not a big DiCaprio fan.  But it's hard not to like him in this movie.  Amazing price for a Steelbook edition of a classic.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Really enjoy the cd.I have it in the car and listen to it many times.Bocelli sings songs in many languages on this cd.
B000OTM1PO|5.0|Price was too good to pass up this underrated flick.  Still think it's a shame Routh isn't reprising his role as I think he was one of the best to play Superman.  And Spacey made you absolutely hate his guts.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|We loved this movie the first time we saw it years ago.  We decided it had to be in our Christmas Movie collection.
B000O76T90|5.0|How can you not love the most amazing Christmas move all time, and one o the most perfect actin films ever which makes his one of the greatest, perfect films all time.
1449305172|5.0|I founded openpicus.com company and thanks to this book I understood how to move in the right way during the first steps until you have \\"a plan that works\\". It's really clear and goes straight to the point. Absolutely a must read for each startupper!
B000B5XOXY|5.0|Price was too damn good for this very worthy entrant in the 90's Batman films.  Kilmer did a great job as Batman, and Jones and Carrey were great villains.  Not as good as Burton's, but still quite good.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I totally enjoyed this movie, the characters are amazing and so well played by the actors.  I'm entering this stage of my life so I am able to feel and understand the story line quite well.  Life is unpredictable, life changing and amazingly surprising and this movie reveals the magic of life in a heartwarming, positive and encouraging fashion.
B001GKJ2ES|5.0|Sort of enjoyed the movie.  The price for this was amazing, but I kind of wish I didn't buy it.  I was just ordering a load of movies at the time.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I fell in love with this album as soon as the beat drops in Tap Out. All The Time is probably the most forgettable song on the album, but I love the chorus. One Way Trigger is one of my favorite Strokes songs in a while. Then It continues with the best song on the album, Welcome To Japan. 80's Comedown Machine really changes the pace of the album, for tje better. Just when the album slows down it jumps right back up with 50/50 which is my least favorite track on the album. Slow Animals is the Strokes song that really makes you hope that they continue with this style previously used in Life Is Simple In The Moonlight. The album again perks up with Partners In Crime, a really catchy, unique, and interesting song. The Strokes really showed their range with Chances, probably the best ballad I've heard in years. Happy Endings has a originaly unique intro, and is yet another catchy pop song. Finally, The Strokes disembark from modern music and go retro like really retro, pre-50's retro, pre-40's retro, you just have to hear it. Call It Fate Call It Karma is just, wow. I really recomend Comedown Machine from a musical perspective. This is by far (musically) the best Strokes album to date. If you think they should revert back to Is This It and do two-chord rock songs then this album is not for you, but if you actually appreciate music then I can't recommend a better current album.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I left my cell phone at work (which I use to wake me up in the morning).  Its easy to use, It worked great, and the graphics are clear.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I found The Hobbit to be just a tad slow starting, but having seen all the Lord of the Rings movies numerous times, I found this to be very entertaining.  It shows Bilbo Baggins when he was young and how he found his bravery.  It shows how he found The Ring that would cause so much trouble down the line.  I strongly advice anyone who loves the Lord of the Rings movies to be sure and watch this movie!  I don't think you will be sorry.
B00011KHTM|5.0|I had to get this product because the monitor of my Macbook darkened after booting and I couldn't find a solution at the forums. But I had a flat screen monitor that I wasn't using. So why not put it to good use? I then discovered that I could connect the two with a Mini DVI to VGA Adapter. I searched Amazon and voila!, I found a vendor with a new but inexpensive adapter. It was shipped intact and now I'm using the product without a hitch. This is one of those purchases that I feel so good about!
0743270754|5.0|I saw the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; and was extremely interested in reading the book that inspired it. Doris Kearns Goodwin never disappoints me.
B000FA675C|5.0|great book from a great author.  a real page-turner.  spawned a movie. epic read. get it now, then get the rest of dan brown's books. you won't be disappointed.
B004L79VUI|5.0|performing at his  art.  Robbie Robertson has been around for a long time - he has tried different genres of music and a cd by him is always a welcome relief from much of the stuff played on the radio nowadays.  Why he isn't, heaven only knows.  He is a true American treasure who really, still isn't appreciated.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Its .99 Cents. Well worth the money when you compare it to any other game worth .99 cents. Scribblenauts for DS is still worth around $15-$20 for the game. Buy it.
B000I5X81A|5.0|These are both world class composers and musicians (Mr. Clapton more so than Mr. Cale).  I love putting this one in and settling back to relax.<br /><br />If you like good lyrics, good playing by two great artists - then get this.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could imagine and see all the places and characters in this story as if I were living it amazing!!!!
B000FQ4M58|3.0|I would award anything less than 5 stars to a Meat Loaf CD.  But I did.  This is not in the same league as the original Bat Out of Hell or even the second one.  Heck - it is a step below some of his &#34;in between&#34; stuff.  He needs to regroup and try again.  His voice is still pretty strong and he still has some good musicians to back him - but there is something that is missing - maybe he needs to try a different style?
B00000F14B|5.0|It was fantastic on the big screen where it should be viewed, but just as charming and inspiring a musical on DVD.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  Action?  Not really.  Totally accurate, historical drama?  Not quite.  But pretty accurate, well acted, great sets, great cast, great direction, etc etc.<br /><br />It is one of those movies that will be discussed years from now.  Mr. Lewis deserved his academy award for this movie.<br /><br />The ones who naysay this film need to get a grip.  This film should be watched as part of a twin-flick night.  The second movie needs to be &#34;Conspirator.&#34;  Look it up.
B00A2WM4XW|5.0|Other than Bill Paxton's extremely annoying character, I love Aliens. I always have. I think it was a decent sequel in one of the strongest sci-fi franchises ever. If you haven't seen it, you might as well do so with the HD version. Well worth it!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|A cd from the foo fighters is like a visit from a good friend.  You know you are going to be entertained and you know that you want them to stay longer.  Dave and the boys are always welcome here.  If you are not a fan, you should examine the reasons why.  If you are a fan, and you do not have this in your collection, why not?
B0094KORXI|5.0|...well, maybe after Fantasia. But nonetheless, I can't count how many times I've seen this movie. It's got to be one that everyone has seen and loved. Watched it with a couple of friends a while ago and everyone knew every word to every song and pretty much could quote the entire movie. Not hard to see that this movie is so well loved. Another Disney classic that everybody should at least see if not own.
B004GHBQ7O|4.0|I have always liked Green Day.  This one, however, is a notch below what I have come to expect from them.  Not that this is a bad CD, far from it - just, well, ordinary.  And that is a word that one does not use lightly with Green Day.  Worth the price though - they can still rock.

1451695195|5.0|free will.<br /><br />after reading some of the negative reviews, i think a few people have missed the point.  god's presence is all around us and you just have to be open to hearing it and using your free will to follow or not.<br /><br />yes dr. alexander may have had malpractice suits and bad choices during his life.  he states his deep depression over his birth mother's rejection was the root of his dark time in his life, an obvious allusion to those suits and the fallout afterwards.  for the briefest moment, i was put off and persuaded by the negative reviews of dr. alexander.  after reflecting a bit on his story i realized the following:<br /><br />my own personal interpretation of his story is that the e.coli meningitis was god's \\"wake-up call\\" to him.  god's way of asking \\"your life is beautiful, why are you messing it up?\\"<br /><br />he woke up and decided to spread god's message of love as he alone experienced it.<br /><br />this book was not meant to be absolute proof of heaven.  this is one individual's story of how his life was spiraling out of control and god's message to him that physical life here on earth is fragile, don't waste it.<br /><br />his hope was to convert skeptics, especially science based ones, that the world is more than our physical matter.  the spouting of his credentials was not to brag but rather show credence to his own earthly mind's rationale against spirituality and illustrate that he himself was the most scientific skeptic of all.  it was only this NDE that made him a believer.<br /><br />it was an individual's story of extreme disbelief turned into true spirituality and belief in god.  we can choose to use his experience as we move forward or we can choose not to.<br /><br />i for one was moved by his story because of my own personal experience with my mother's death in 1994.  throughout the years, she has made herself \\"present\\" during the most difficult times in my life.  i have most recently been painfully struggling with the idea that evil is so abundant in this world we live in.  somehow i was led to this story and i truly believe that this book was a message from my mom giving me hope so i can move forward on this path of life on earth.  i used my free will to make that decision and hope others can too.<br /><br />thank you dr. alexander for your message.
0887081770|5.0|Great book for early readers.  The reading/words are easy to follow for new readers.  It moves quickly if youi have a child with short attention span, or you can take the time and expand on ideas and stories for each page.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.  Disneynature has done it again.  Just wish Jane Goodall or Eugene Cussons had narrated this movie. Tim did an ok job, but sometimes I couldn't forget it was Tim and get lost in the narration.  Kind of like when an actor is bigger than the part or the movie.  You see the actor and not the character.  Plus, having either Jane or Eugene would have been a great opportunity to learn more about the species.  I like the personality that Tim gave to the Chimps, but a little more information on conservation would have been nice.
B0001MLMKY|3.0|The Swatch Once Again is in my opinion the most stylish among the core collection, in the sense that it looks good and will never look bad with the changing times. The watch is also very accurate, keeping within 25 seconds a month. The loud ticking might put some people off, while the case and strap are not very durable. The crystal is made of plastic, and scratches easily. The crown is a little small, as is standard on Swatch gents, and may trouble those with fatter fingers. The battery is easily accessed, and if you are the sort who likes to change your batteries yourself, this would be a good option.

B003UBTX6S|3.0|Like Beautiful Creatures, this book skews a bit young for me.  It is definitely engaging, though. I initially had not planned on reading the third and fourth books in this series, but by the end of Beautiful Darkness I cared enough about all the characters to want to know more. So, here I go onto book 3.....

B000JMKQX0|3.0|After reading so many of the positive reviews, I thought this book would be a sure bet for an interesting story. Turns out, I found very few of the individual tales from zombie survivors around the world to be gripping/emotional/scary, etc. One of the stories mentions what happens to the whales during the zombie uprising. No spoilers here, don't worry. In any case, this particular story touched me the most. A few others were notable, but I can count them all on one hand. Bottom line, I hope the movie does a better job. I was ready to get the book over with already.

On the Kindle version I have to tap the airplanes several times to get the information block to pop up. It does run much smother on the iPhone, but I love the bigger screen of the Kindle Fire HD. I would recommend this app, but make sure you buy this one and not the free one. The Pro version gives you more information about the aircraft and their flights.

Everyone who comes over immediately picks it up and comments on the photos.  It is a great conversation starter! I picked up an extra copy as a gift for my dog lover/photographer friend.
1616551151|5.0|Its a great read. Its set up more like a text book. It is broken down in sections, which makes it easy to read up on the sections you are most interested in at the moment without having to thumb through the whole book. The art work I would give an 8 out of 10 with some art being fantastic and others falling short of my expectations. Some of the images are recycled from other source material and concept art, however their is plent of new art. Content wise the book gives more depth and detail to parts of the Thedas not closely examined in the games/novels. The book as a whole exceeded my expections. If you are a Dragon Age fan I suggest this as a must buy.

B004WOJ6XC|5.0|On their ninth full-length, Rhapsody Of Fire offer few surprises. Instead, the Italian band seem content to just shell out the good stuff: Epically epic, symphonic power metal, by the barrel full. As with most any release of this kind, it is the guitars are the main attraction, here, by uncorking loads of solos that are just downright terrific. But the keyboardist (Alex Staropoli) and even the bassist (Patrice Guers) also occasionally get in on the action, laying down exceptional solos from time to time. It all makes 2011's \\"From Chaos To Eternity\\" a really good melodic/symphonic power metal record.<br /><br />Highlights on this fine album are not exactly few and/or far between. The set's indisputably biggest highpoint comes in the form of the proper record's closing song, \\"Heroes Of The Waterfalls' Kingdom.\\" This unbelievably epic number is nearly twenty-whole minutes long, and it has five different parts to it (\\"The Spirit Of The Forest,\\" \\"Realm Of Sacred Waterfalls,\\" \\"Thanor's Awakening,\\" \\"Northern Skies Enflamed,\\" and \\"The Splendor Of Angels' Glory -- A Final Revelation\\"). It begins as a serene and low-key ballad with spoken-word vocals and pretty-sounding acoustic guitar plucking. And this all works its way up to being a mightily soaring power ballad that would make any fan of Iron Maiden blush, and is complete with lots -- and I do mean LOTS -- of infectious guitar shredding (there are numerous spots of delicious melodic soloing and sweep picking present, here.) And this sprawling, yet somehow cohesive piece closes with the ominous sound of some choral-esque chanting.<br /><br />But with that said, the beginning of the album is also of note. Opener \\"Ad Infinitum\\" is a triumphant-sounding symphonic intro track with creepy, foreboding spoken-word narration. Then the album really gets underway, thanks to the title song, with its nicely melodic guitar leads, oh-so-Iron Maiden-ish singing, brisk, fiery riffing, and noteworthy bass work (there are strong, grumbling bass lines coursing throughout, except for the spot when Guers steps out from behind the shadow to uncork an excellent bass solo.) Then, when thrashy, speed metal-derived double kick drumming, twiddly melodical soloing, and memorable vocal patterns (the tune enlists the use of two different vocalists: One to chant away, and the other to lay down some low, growly vocals) are added to the mix, the end result is one heckuva powerful (and memorable) way to kick of the record!<br /><br />The proceeding \\"Tempesta Di Fuoco (Firestorm)\\" finds Rhapsody Of Fire's guitarists doing battle against the rest of the band, with its harmonic guitar intro that segues into really tasty melodic leads and wailing solo runs duking it out with the keyboardist and bassist (both of whom play a lengthy solo, here). Next up, \\"Ghosts Of Forgotten Worlds\\" is a majestically soaring, Iron Maiden-worshipping ballad with Opeth-ian melodic strings and towering guitar harmonies. It has a heavy, grumbling bass line, too, sure; but its main attraction comes in the form of a Yngwie Malmsteen/Dragonforce-worthy keyboard/guitar trade-off soloing section.<br /><br />On later tracks, such as \\"I Belong To The Stars\\" (an apt title for this song, considering how well and high it soars), and the operatic \\"Anima Perduta (Lost Soul)\\" are two very dramatic cuts with clean singing, low-key string arrangements, and accompanying, harmonizing keyboard runs. But whereas the former of these two songs has miles of memorable sweep picking, the latter substitutes in vocals and lyrics that are sung exclusively in the band's foreign tongue (Italian). And elsewhere, \\"Aeons Of Raging Darkness\\" and \\"Tornado\\" are two of the record's biggest curveballs, as both are pieces of almost pure, full-on thrash metal. The former has a Motorhead-inspired bass intro followed by a seemingly endless cascade of blistering speedster picking and drumming; and the latter has some surprisingly thrashy beats, too, including plenty of machine gun-fast double bass thudding. Another epic, and infectiously melodic solo is tossed into the mix, here, as well. Finally, if you get the digipak version of the album (and you definitely ought to), you will be treated to one final song: A very closely-covered rendition of the Iron Maiden classic \\"Flash Of The Blade.\\"<br /><br />Again, Rhapsody Of Fire do not knock many new walls down on \\"From Chaos To Eternity,\\" but they do still, nonetheless, come up with a winner of an album. Indeed, the boys do not disappoint on this 2011 release. They sure know how to come up with one mighty tasty symphonic/neo-classical/progressive/speed/power metal milkshake.t double bass thudding.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Don't think I have seen this approach since Robert Montgomery starred in (and, I believe, Directed) Lady in the Lake filmed as it would have looked through the eyes of his character, the Detective. Substitute a home movie camera and you have Cloverfield, something like 60 years later. I was taken by the Montgomery film (as I was by almost everything that pioneer star of the talkies did) and am quite taken with this one  (despite the absence of any  presence playing in the same league that he did). For the most part, I  think the cast did very well, playing people who were not supposed to be actors, and the filming, as if from a hand held camera, made for very effective viewing.<br />The set-up is simple: a going-away party is being given one of the young (20 something) crowd, on the eve of his departure for Japan for a new job. One of his friends is suckered into being the cameraman, taking statements from attendees on film to be given the man of the hour for future watching. Midway through the party, Manhattan Island (NYc) is attacked by never clearly seen monsters. The remainder of the film is devoted to responses to the attack and attempts to get all the friends to safety.<br />There is little phoney heroics. There are some unlikely actions but,  on the whole, the gimmick works and I was quite pleased with the results. I can recommend it to fans of action and disaster thrillers.

B0041VB8BO|5.0|Many people only know fun. because of the \\"Some Nights\\" fame, which is such a shame. This album is beyond amazing. When you make an album that somebody can listen to for over 3 years and not get sick of a single song, is amazing. Nate Ruess belts out the wonderfully witty lyrics while Jack Antonoff and Andrew Dost strum and hit the keys of their instruments, complimenting each other perfectly. While I do enjoy Some Nights, no comparison. Personally, my favorite tracks are \\"Benson Hedges\\" \\"The Gambler\\" and \\"At Least I'm Not As Sad (As I Used To Be)\\" but they really are all amazing. Don't hesitate to purchase this album.<br /><br />Also, check out the band \\"The Format\\" Nate's old band. Their old albums have the same great vibe as this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this whole series. I'd heard many talking about it but rarely read fiction. I'm glad I made an exception.
B0011Z3334|5.0|Hayley Williams is the only female vocalist that I listen to regularly and enjoy. The amazing thing about this album is, there isn't a bad track on it. Seems impossible, especially for a band's second album, but it is true. If you haven't yet, give it a listen. A few key tracks for me are \\"We Are Broken\\" \\"For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic\\" and \\"When It Rains\\" A great album that won't disappoint.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mark Watney has a problem.  Actually he has hundreds and perhaps thousands of problems.  He was thought lost and dead and he was left on Mars alone.  Rescue is perhaps as long as 4 years or so away and that is if it ever comes.  He will run out of food, water, air and everything he needs to live long before that.  He is alone with no communication to Earth and no way to survive long term.<br /><br />His most important assets are his education in Engineering and Botany, his NASA training, what little equipment and assets he has with him and a relentless desire to LIVE......<br /><br />This is an excellent book filled with a story of a sort of modern day Robinson Crusoe.  His ingenuity and drive help him to overcome numerous and complex things that happen when you are alone on another planet without help or proper support.  It is a masterful book that kept me in suspense and with the desire for Mark Watney to live, just like the billions on planet Earth who watched this saga unfold on TV.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely and I recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi.  Some parts of the book are filled with such tension and stress that you cannot stop reading just because you want to see what happens next.  This is a great book!
0141384948|5.0|From the creator of the spectacular Percy Jackson series, (Percy Jackson & the lightning thief made into a major film), is book 1 in the Kane Chronicles series. Witty and cleverly satirical this is a book which will have you in stitches, truly touched by such a gripping tale of inspired creative vision. Rick Riordan is a fantastic writer who brings history vividly to life in a way that is current, contemporary and refreshingly modern. I absolutely love the blending of modern and myth which makes it that touch more believable, thus making for vastly entertaining reading. Amid a gripping storyline is a host of captivating characters who are thrown into the midst of exciting fast-paced action and nail-biting drama, as electrifying as if you are a part of the story stuck in the pages.<br /><br />The Red Pyramid is about an ancient curse, two heroes and an evil that won't stay buried...One follows Carter and Sadie Kane's story as they witness that significant night in which their dad blew up the British Museum! He is an Egyptologist with a secret plan that unfortunately goes horribly wrong, with the explosion shattering an ancient Rosetta Stone thus unleashing great evil into the modern world. Whilst Dr Kane is imprisoned within a Golden Coffin, it is up to Sadie and Carter to not only save their dad but also the twenty-first century from a deadly terror. As they set off on an epic quest which takes them from Cairo and Paris to the American South-West, they discover the truth about their family connection to the House of Life: an Egyptian temple of magic.<br /><br />The pharaohs of Ancient Egypt are far from dead and buried. And so, unfortunately are their Gods...<br /><br />This extraordinarily electrifying tale reminded me so much of the film \\"The Mummy\\" and also the action film \\"The Mummy Returns\\", wherein memorable characters awaken an ancient Mummy who is intent on revenge and unleashing horrors across the world from the middle of Egypt. I am fascinated by the Egyptian myths & Legends, how they believed in reincarnation, mummifying and worshiped great Gods. They built magnificent stone temples across Egypt and were in possession of many archaic artifacts which (they say) had magical properties. It is quite extraordinary how the author mixes together magic, myth within a modern-day setting and brings it all to life with humor and intense drama that is explosive. Carter and Sadie are brilliant characters who similarly to Percy Jackson, Grover and Annabeth are likable and memorable.<br /><br />Unable to put this book down even for a moment, I was literally glued to the pages unable to tear my gaze from the addictive volume beneath my fingertips. Supremely magical, exhilarating and dynamic this intense read is so enjoyable as to have me entranced and utterly spellbound throughout! I would highly recommend Rick Riordan's Kane Chronicles to those who love action and adventure, magic and myth all combined in an epic work of sheer magnificenceian myths & Legends, how they believed in reincarnation, mummifying and worshiped great Gods.

B005IQZB14|4.0|I had read all of the reviews on this book and just wasn't sure I wanted to read it. I took the gamble and can say I enjoyed it. I think it is partly because I have that desire to want to just go off and hike and let everything go just as she had done.  It's an honest story of someone looking for something and not entirely knowing what it is you are looking for.  I would recommend the book for anyone who longs to do that special hike and just can't do it... you can get lost her story for awhile.

Today, however, after purchasing the dvd and watching it once more, I wonder how I could have been so mistaken back then.  As usual, both Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman turned in top performances as Devil's Island inmates  This is probably as good a picture on that subject as ever put out.  While viewing it, I seemed to feel like one of the unfortunate prisoners myself.  Papillon, by the way, is French for butterfly, pertaining to the huge tattoo of one on Steve's chest.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this version. It's a great form of escapism. No bugs that I can tell. I do wish there was a multi-suit option, but for free it's a good version.<br />EDIT*** just figured out how to change the number of suits while playing. This game rocks. :)
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|I love Eagles followed them all those years so I am bias , It was great to listen non stop of their music I just wish sound quality of the bluray was worthy of their music.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Love the movie. Love the soundtrack. Amazing music and composition. Not to mention great singers. Great for any Les Mis collection.
B0002C4JE4|5.0|James Taylor's voice is beautiful and the songs are eternal. This album is just as good as I remebered when I was a teenager.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Such a great story and this a wonderful adaptation! So emotional and inspiring. Something to watch again and again. This is what got me hooked on the book and musical. Phenomenal.
0452289963|3.0|This book is a contium of Toole's book &#34;The Power of Now&#34;. I didn't know that before buying this book. So if you haven't read &#34;The Power of Now&#34;, then this one is difficult to understand.
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|This could be a great app if it worked.  Using it on a Kindle Fire, the app won't let you put in a location.  It's useless to me.  Don't spend any money for an app that does not work
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I have been very pleased with the first set. I wasn't sure it would be interesting, but it's great. I will recommend the set to all my co-workers.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Great read. Hope you still aren't drinking soda, you won't be after reading this. Would have preferred the discussion of fat not spew all the myths and do a better job of separating bad vege fats from others.
B0091REZMW|3.0|i like the searches  but i dont want to have to buy energy  all the time. so i don't  play that often anymore.
0679411585|5.0|An absolutely fascinating look at the men who fought and died in the Ia Drang Valley. The book is wonderful and sad.<br />I am highly disappointed in the condition of the book, however. Pages were stuck together, the dust cover was torn and some pages looked to have been cut. 5 stars for the story, 1 star for the condition.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I enjoy the calculator especially the larger screen and the in the use of it.  I am sure it will get lots of use.

B00C2PO09I|5.0|Most viewers will regret they could not see this at the movie theaters due to a lousy distribution deal. Not a perfect movie, but definitely a one of a kind visual experience. Hopefully the Academy will get a copy and give nods to the outstanding special effects and art direction.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Lil Wayne is one of the greatest rappers ever, but damn this CD sucks!  Lyrics are awful.  Beats are awful.  Where is the Lil Wayne of old?  Lil Wayne left the building about 4 years ago... dunno if he's coming back.
B004XISI4A|4.0|The man's imagination I is incredible! The book is beautifully written. The characters unbelievable and the plot intricate beyond belief! My only complaint is that the plot I  too elaborate. It is as if Mr Martin follows the plot up to a point and then gets bored with it. At that point he either kills one of the principal characters, or introduces a new one. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating as opposed to a 5!<br /><br />The man is brilliant, and I am so hooked! I can't wait for the next book in the series!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this series!!  I recommend that everyone read the books and then watch the show!!  The show and the books follow one another very well and it is a very well written series.
B00011KHTM|5.0|This product is 100% original, the price does not compare to the one offered by Apple, and it finally works perfectly with my macbook, thanks.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book,it absolutely changed my way of thinking forever. Definitely worth a read to all those sceptics out  there (like I was) He shares in great detail his experience while in a coma,and all the reasons that it can't be a delusion. Definitely made a believer out of me.

1594204217|5.0|To state the obvious, few people can write about food and food related issues like Michael Pollan. He has changed the way our culture--or at least well-read segments of our culture--thinks about our industrial food complex. In Cooked, Pollan takes his keen eye from large scale systems and focuses it on the kitchen and cooking (while naturally showing the connections to bigger issues). I suppose, I should write \\"my\\" kitchen, as Pollan is directing us to make this intimate and personal account. To build our relationship with food, we need to cook for ourselves, and from scratch (at least most of the time). While cooking has lost much of its esteem in our fast-paced, fast-food society, Pollan reevaluates the significance of cooking in everyday life: \\"Cooking, I found, gives us the opportunity, so rare in modern life, to work directly in our own support, and in the support of the people we feed. If this is not `making a living,' I don't know what is\\" (pg23).<br /><br />In Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, Pollan pairs his sharp journalism skills with his acumen as a thoughtful analytic essayist to look more deeply at the way we transform plants and animals into food--and why a better understanding of how and why we do it matters. He observes: \\"The work, or process, [of cooking] retains an emotional or psychological power we can't quite shake, or don't want to. And in fact it was after a long bout of watching cooking programs on television that I began to wonder if this activity I had always taken for granted might be worth taking a little more seriously\\" (pg4). Not surprisingly to anyone familiar with Pollan's work, he uses cooking to help restore our connections to a healthier natural world.<br /><br />Pollan looks at cooking from an almost magically scientific perspective: \\"Cooks get to put their hands on real stuff, not just keyboards and screens but fundamental things like plants and animals and fungi. They get to work with the primal elements, too, fireand water, earth and air, using them--mastering them!--to perform their tasty alchemies\\" (pg5). Accordingly, the four elements--fire, water, air, and earth (which correspond to the essential ways we turn to raw materials into meals)--organize the book. Fire = grilling; water = using liquids to cook; air = baking; earth = fermenting. Granted, it's not a neat categorization (after all, you need fire to bake bread*), but metaphorically the organizing principles work in the sense that Pollan is trying to get us to look at food afresh and referencing the basic elements helps do that, at least poetically (and a writer as good as Pollan works on the subconscious/subtle level). Going further, he cites research and the stories of \\"deep foodies,\\" to get us to see with beginners mind. This is his gift; and it makes us care.<br /><br />Pollan looks at the process and science of cooking (barbecuing, baking, fermenting, braising/steaming, etc.) along with each method's effect on us. For example, cooking over high heat contributed to primates' brains growing larger through eating more efficient with easier and faster to digest foods. Fermented foods help increase healthy bacteria in our intestinal tract. And \\"microbiologists believe that onions, garlic and spices protect us from the growth of dangerous bacteria on meat.\\" (It's likely not just a coincidence that we are drawn to such flavors.)<br /><br />In short, this is classic Pollan (ahem) fare. Anyone who has enjoyed MP's other books, are likely to find this one well worthwhile as well.<br /><br />*Example of quote illustrating classification: \\"To compare a loaf of bread to a bowl of porridge is to realize how much of bread's power, sensory as well as symbolic, risdes in those empty cells of space. Some 80 percent of a loaf of bread consists of nothing more than air.\\" (pg. 249)

B007PVHMCG|4.0|My 10 year old is into mine craft.  He really enjoyed a hands on experience.  He only got a little frustrated once trying to follow the instructions.  Lots of tiny pieces.  Kept him off the video version for at least one evening.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The movie is amazing, the songs and actors terific, the nly problem, Digital copy do not work in Chile............. WHY?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app and it is not one you can finish in a day. It is very time consuming. I recommend it to everyone!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this game! It's so cool. I updated my game to animal and dinosaur rescue but there are no dinosaurs. But I still think it's a good game.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Of course I love pinterest! However I feel like the app freezes a lot! Sometimes the search but won't work either.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I go on YouTube everyday and just love it! But I can't log into my account that I have (but I can do it on my computer). Then it takes forever to find a simple video and then when I finally find the video that I want it says that I can't watch it and I have to download it!!!!!!! I would recommend getting this app but these are probably the only problems that you are going to have. It loads fine on my kindle fire but sometimes it doesn't.<br />So anyways I recommend getting this app but you might run into those few problems.......!!!!!!!!  :-)  ;-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Books are generally better than the movies, but these were close.  The few details that were different and the insight into the thinking of the characters that you get from the book are well worth taking the time to read the book.  It's a quick read anyway.
0446560073|4.0|The author captures the secret life of cats perfectly. The book is laugh out loud fun. The expression on the cat's face is priceless.
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|Easy to install in 30 seconds.  Because it's not bolted on, it's easy to change it's location.  Good visibility of traffic. Doesn't take up much space.  I put it on the end of my handlebar so I have maximum visibility.  You can adjust it to just about any angle.  My only complaint is that it doesn't stay at the angle you want, but you just readjust it.  I'm going to buy one for the right side.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Had reservations about picking up this book.  I was in an airport in Panama & wanted something to read on my 2 long flights home.  I was/am floored by the intelligent writing & superb plot.  I would recommend it in the highest possible terms.
0385349947|3.0|I am a long-time admirer of Sandberg, especially after her inspiring TED talk. But there was one topic so blatantly omitted from \\"Lean In\\" that I almost thought the book hadn't downloaded completely: women entrepreneurs. There is not a single full sentence, let alone paragraph or chapter, devoted to this mushrooming class of women who have decided to take control of their own fate, instead of joining in the Sisyphean task of changing power dynamics from the inside out that Sandberg advocates. Elementary buzz words (from Sandberg's own industry no less) like \\"innovation,\\" \\"invention,\\" \\"entrepreneurship\\" and \\"disruption\\" are virtually non-existent, nevermind promoted. Instead, the book is focused on increasing women in positions of power in \\"governments, corporations, academia, hospitals, law firms, non-profits...[and] research labs.\\" That about sums up Sandberg's scope. \\"Lean In\\" reads like an instruction manual on how to run on a hamster wheel of corporate or traditionally defined success when, ironically, she leads a company founded on the exact opposite of these ideals by a visionary college dropout who wanted to upend the world order (for better or worse). Her book is written squarely for women (like her) who possess the admirable patience and perseverance to log decades working for men like Mark Zuckerberg, and, perplexingly, not a call to arms for women to become the next Mark Zuckerberg.<br /><br />With the power of technology, innovation, and education, the model she advances is becoming- and arguably has become- obsolete. Her approach already feels outdated and it's hard to see how \\"Lean In\\" will inspire a revolution. Her call to arms seems to be, \\"hang on to the jungle gym bars and and claw your way towards something that resembles 'power' so we can claim victory when the face of 'power' looks more equal.\\" To my mind, increased power and victory for women will not come solely from playing nice within existing empires, but from building empires of their own.<br /><br />Every role model I have has \\"taken the off ramp\\" (in some cases quite early) and, through ingenuity and grit, created her own highway. They haven't had to elbow for a seat at the Old Boys Club table. They've built their own damn table.<br /><br />For well-educated women entrenched in and committed to transforming behemoth institutions: \\"Lean In\\" is the roadmap for you. Godspeed. But for creative, enterprising, scrappy, imaginative, restless, optimistic women of every stripe eager to carve out a fulfilling career look elsewhere. Swiss Miss/Tina Roth-Eisenberg's list of over 300 women entrepreneurs is a good place to start. They aren't leaning in. They are leading the way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having this app makes it easy to connect with God daily. The plans are really helpful with whatever you're going through. There's only 2 drawbacks: you're not able to see the previous day's verse/chapter if you miss it and you must be connected to wifi in order to read it.<br /><br />Other than that, I love this app!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This was recommended by a family member.  We find this program very interesting and we are intrigued by the story line.  The characters are great. We are hooked.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The case was a little cracked, but other then that I was very happy with it. And you can't beat the price.
B004N6369Y|5.0|This was an excellent book.  Especially enjoyed the way she weaves all the characters together.  What an enjoyable read!  Look forward to more of her s.
B002RSDW8A|4.0|I'm pretty much satisfied with this item - the only thing I was disappointed about was that it's a blu-ray, but it's in a DVD case...so my  OCD self is upset that it doesn't match with the rest of my blu-rays. But for $7 you can't expect perfection. Pleased with my purchase overall.
0525953590|5.0|I can't say enough good about this book.  It is comprehensive and so well written.  It is written so anyone with a basic interest in science and the universe can understand it.  Yet, it is also detailed enough that readers can't help but appreciate the complex foundations of our universe.  As must read as far as I am concerned.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo app I have found. The only thing I don't like is that they changed the amount of free credits you receive. I hope they change that. Otherwise I have had hours and hours of fun playing.
B00908DDZM|3.0|It's ok, but I wish I had just bought the two songs I wanted on ITunes.  There's only 2 good songs on the CD, bummed.
0062059963|5.0|I absolutely couldn't put this book down.  While I did enjoy The Selection, the second book in the series was a vast improvement over the first.  So many twists and turns and hints and things to come had me giddy and distraught and happy and sad, all at the same time.  My only regret is that the third book in the series won't be out for so long.
B008EKON56|4.0|I like it. Would recomend it. No issues to note. It works as discribed.  A nice IPOD add-on for line out volume. Great sound

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I LOVE this game but I don't really get the friend system. I cant go any further then scootaloo! I invited my friend from facebook and he accepted but it downy show in my friend list, and how do you get gameloft friends? Other then that its a really fun game but if you cant go any further in a quest, your stuck, and you cant buy hearts.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I like this game. It is taking me a awhile to learn how to play, but overall I like it. The only problem is the fact that sometimes when I click on the icon to play the game, the game comes up with the volume at full blast. This happened to me one time when I had earphones on, and I swear I almost lost my hearing.
B009AMANBA|5.0|We ordered this movie through amazon as we had viewed it at the local theater and wanted to re-see it because if was such a very good story about  one of America's best presidents. The DVD was very closely copied from the original true story so it keeps your attention. Recommend getting the DVD to any one liking Lincoln and a good re-enactment of American history. I know we will watch it every so often. Good value purchase. cga

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game just pulls you in because you want to beat all the new daily and weekly challenges!  What do you do with all the points and gems you've accumulated after you've gained all the characters and power ups?  Yet you just can't stop....I don't care if you run 2k meters or 10k, I just replay over and over and over again, especially after finally mastering the tunnel ride.  One good thing, I'll never use real money.  Please don't develop a TR3!!!!!!  Aargh!!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The movie is amazing, if you liked LOTR you are going to love The Hobbit. The movie doesn't stick to much to the book and they made it a little bite like a preview for LOTR but it is still good.<br /><br />You get in the pack 4 different copies of the movie: 2-disc Blu ray 3D version, 1-disc regular Blu ray version, 1-disc DVD version and Ultra Violet online copy!<br /><br />Amazing!

B00CDT41RY|5.0|A really wonderful movie.  The language is colorful.  I wouldn't expect less from a Quentin Tarantino movie.  I was set back at first because of this.  I did not see the film in the theaters.  I waited for video.  I'm going to add this Tarantino gem to my collection.  Well worth the watch.

B00004RFFI|5.0|HOW could any film that begins w/Clapton be bad?  I must not be as knowledgeable about \\"real\\" tornadoes as some of you.  Good plot/good actors = good entertainment.  Helen & Bill - as main characters do good.  Dusty - my 2nd favorite. Melissa my 1st - only intricate/surprising character.  Favorite line:  \\"We've got cows\\".  Melissa the one w/out suicidal tendencies.  I don't Pick at films - either like them or don't.  Yes, predictable plot & yes, fun.  Don't cha just applaud when the \\"sponsored\\" team gets swept away...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great calc app. It has advertisements but they are not much off a bother. It remembers what you calculated even if you turn it off.

B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Unfortunately, I've not managed to play it yet. Apparently it is written to an American format. My DVD player can't handle it. I'm told it is possible to cater for the American format but, I don't know how to do it. A friend has promised to show when time permits. I'm a little disappointed because of this. You see not every one is an IT expert.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It's just as good as the LOTR trilogy - probably because of the vision of the director.  Can't wait to see the rest.
1939416019|1.0|This is one of those books where the cover is the best part of the book. This writer has a long way to go to get a 5 star review from me. The story is weak, the writing needs some serious editing and reworking. I gave it one star for the cool cover.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|Really a joy to read.  Gail Carriger has a fantastic way with the text, taking the reader into a modified England where vampires and werewolves are members of Society.  It it really quite fun and fascinating.  There is romance, action, humor, science-fiction and just tons and tons of fun!<br /><br />I strongly recommend this series for anyone!
B004V6X902|3.0|it was okay. very inappropriate. i'm a huge fan of jim carrey and ewan mcgregor, they were very funny but again inappropiate.

1476734941|2.0|This whole book could be condensed down to one or two paragraphs. My first week following the diet, one pound lost, I expected better results. I'm not giving up but, I will with such meager results.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|great book, page turner. I read at least a couple of books a week and never wrote a review!! This is something else. Mr. Weir, please Im begging you keep it up!
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Seriously, I've been listening to this album non-stop since I got it a week ago. The songs are ridiculously catchy and have a more epic feel to it. They're definitely experimenting more musically, I was caught way off guard when listening to Ghuleh/ Zombie Queen and they bust out of nowhere with this awesome SURF ROCK tune. Simply amazing. This album does have sort of a lighter atmosphere, and is a bit more upbeat then Opus, but it doesn't take away from the music, they way they do it is really cool. Year Zero and Monstrance Clock are instant classics, while the other tracks are all quite good. It also has quite possibly the coolest opening track I've heard. This album is just amazing, enough said. In a scene that's been riddled with all these deathcore/metalcore whatever \\"core\\" bands for the past 10 years or so, It's nice to hear something a bit different. Hopefully their next album is monumental.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Both USB ports are way too tight. Every time I pull out the cable I feel like I'm going to break it (especially super thin cables like the Apple lightning ones).<br /><br />Edit: 3 May 2013<br />Anker contacted me less than 24 hours I posted the review above, and sent me a replacement unit. The replacement unit's UBS ports are still a little tighter than the typical USB port (e.g. on the back of my Gigabyte motherboard, or my macbook air), but they are much better than the original unit. So just be aware that the Astro2's USB ports run a little tight, and don't yank too hard on thin cables like the Apple lightning ones. In any case, Anker's customer service is fantastic.
0316228532|2.0|By far not my favorite book. It was a laborious read. Although I admire and adore the Harry Potter series, I hate to down-play a work of the famous, talented and highly acclaimed J. K. Rowling. I feel that this book wasn't worth my time for other than to satisfy my curiosity as to what else might be in her head. I hope there's more.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like this game. The makers of it just need to make sure that everyone knows that your internet needs to be great so the game doesn't freeze. I can say that they are very good about refunding if you buy and then loose due to possible problems.
1401937268|5.0|I love these cards! I have never been able to connect with tarot cards. None, and I tried many kinds. This is the only deck that I connected with as soon as I got them. I have a wonderful connection with the angels and I love how they speak to me through these cards. just like Doreen, I have been put off by the harsh energies of traditional cards. These cards are large like oracle cards so they may be difficult for some to shuffle, although they bend nicely. They have a silver edge that just makes them wonderful to handle. Basically I am totally thrilled to have finally found a tarot deck that I connect with!!
B004YCKK6Y|1.0|It made no sense.  Since I bought it for my son: age 30 I should have rated it for him....4 stars.

B00B8WXG9G|5.0|If you like Paul Anka, then you will like this. Here are fourteen duets, performed with singers who have their own unique voice, each adds his or her personal touch to the duet. Let's start with my favoirite, Do I love You, with Dolly Parton. This stands out as something particularly special here. I think it's to do with the fact that she doesn't try to blow out the song, but captures its emotion with lightness. It's the distinct way that she articulates the words with clarity and the timbre of her voice. It is also a song where Paul Anka allows more emotion through in his own singing. In addition, Dolly weaves in her delicate, but distinctive backing vocal as he sings his part. Her delicate touch adds to the song. Some of the duets seem locked in the sixties and seventies and although very polished and professional, there is a datedness to them. The Dolly Parton treatment helps the song out of this rut despite the cresendo build up at the end.I also liked the duet with Patti LaBelle, You are my destiny, I think she brings something with her excellent vocals,  though again, it has a certain period dusting it. Crazy with Willie Nelson is notable for his simplicity, remembering that Nelson penned this song which was a hit for Patsy Cline. Again Nelson adds that Country clarity, It's interesting to have Michael Jackson for the collection and he sounded good. I mention only a few, but in fact the are all excellent. If you are into Dion, Bublé, Sinatra, Tom Jones, Leon Russell, Estefan, McDonald and Benson, you will not be disappointed. Just a little comment. Duet chemistry is hard to find and I think in particular with Paul Anka, he is more of a solo singer, not a natural duet singer in the way of spinning the voices together. I think a few of the duet partners as mentioned, break that mould a little and improve the CD as a result. I give the five stars as it cannot be faulted for suave sophistication. It's what people expect from him. I bought it as I thought it was interesting to hear other voices also treat the songs.
0684857219|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for anyone in bodybuilding.  I thought it was a very well organized book taking you from the orgins of bodybuilding to about the 90's.  Arnold also does a methodical job of explaining training going from very basic terminology to advanced techniques.  Although not exhaustive the book also features a number of exercises for developing all areas of your physique and I think Arnold did a great job of choosing exercises that are both effective but accessable to all levels of bodybuilder.  That's the main reason this book is so good, it is a wealth of great information for those just beginning and an excellent refresher for those who have been building for a while.

0451196716|5.0|Stephen King's \\"The Walk\\" is the second book by him that I have read.  It was a great and quick read.  The book was an absolute page turner, as I just wanted to find out what happened to the characters, Garraty especially.  I liken this book to be the original \\"Hunger Games\\", in terms of children competing to the death, an idol figure that is looked up to and admired, but secretly hated and winning a \\"prize\\".  I truly enjoyed every minute of the book.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I had just gone through my third malfunctioning Logitech mouse and decided to switch brands. Delivery was quick as always and the packaging was flawless.<br /><br />The mouse has a good weight and feels solid. The software it comes with makes all the buttons extremely easy to bind and the speed of the pointer easy to change. The side buttons do not get in the way of my thumb; I have never accidentally brushed them.<br /><br />I only have two complaints, but I consider them very minor:<br /><br />1) The size of the mouse is not good for small hands. There is too much length between the base of the mouse and the pointer buttons. The mouse is also too high. If either the length or the height were the only problems, I could adjust. But having both issues has made getting used to this mouse take some considerable time.<br /><br />2) The customizable light color feature was appealing until I found out that you can only change the color behind the anchor logo. The speed preset lights and the mouse scroll light will remain blue regardless of your changes. I realize it's a bit picky, but I feel like it was something that could have easily been fixed. I prefer uniformity in aesthetics I design, so rather than use the color function, I just leave the anchor blue to match the rest of the mouse.

B009EHDU7U|5.0|From the opening page I found the plot intriguing. A laugh out loud story that grouped the most unlikely of characters. I couldn't help but like the hero who related so many significant historical moments in which he had been an active participant. Should I live to be 100 years old I would be delighted to be such an uncomplicated eccentric. The supporting cast of characters are just as likeable and interesting as the main character. The author managed to weave an amazing life story into a present day adventure. The book was recommended to me and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to others. Enjoy!

All I will tell you is that there is a lot of Claire and Jamie in this novel.  Yes, they do find a new home in the mountains of North Carolina.  (This made me especially happy as I grew up in South Carolina where the novel begins and we vacationed every year with my grandparents in the mountains of North Carolina.)  My favorite scene of the series so far was between Jamie and Claire.  They had an open, frank, adult discussion about relationships and death.  Claire is such a strong woman but was having a weak moment. Jamie knew exactly what to say because he knows her so well.  Part of my appreciation for this series is due to the fact that DG is writing about adults.  All of the love stories aren't between teenagers or twenty-somethings.  Claire and Jamie are now in their 40s and DG embraces their continuing love story.<br /><br />There is also a lot more of Brianna and Roger in DoA.  I cannot decide if that's a good thing.  Roger is okay and Brianna has okay moments.  She needs to grow up some more before I can truly get on board the Brianna train.  Also, I do feel like there are times that DG is planning for Brianna and Roger to be the next Jamie and Claire.  There really is no comparison.  (Spoiler alert: the first love scene between B&R is pretty awkward for me.  I wasn't a fan and it didn't compare to the worst of the scenes with J&C.)<br /><br />Brianna does go back in time through the stones (not really a spoiler since it's on the book jacket).  How hard would it be to be able research your parents' past and try to decide if you help them based on what you find?  It was heartwarming to read about Jamie's first meeting with Brianna and then see them build a father-daughter relationship.  Jamie has waited so long for this but what an adjustment for both of them!  And, poor Claire in the middle of two-hot headed Scots.<br /><br />5/5 stars for a really great story, great romance between Jamie and Claire and for including the Carolinas.  Thank you, Diana Gabaldon.Brianna and then see them build a father-daughter relationship.  Jamie has waited so long for this but what an adjustment for both of them!

B00177YA1K|5.0|This film was not only very funny, But it really introduced Will Smith to the movie going public.  The special effects were very good, and the supporting cast did a great job.  The premise for ths movie is certainly not that far fetched, as the american public is unfortunately quite used to the idea of another secret government being created to foil earths enemies.  Tommy Lee Jones was right when he said that the us citzenry did not want their everyday lives upset.  Too bad they could not see our world of the present.  All in all a very entertaining film.

Now, Logitech will not stand behind the warranty for it because the PID number is on a sticker that has worn off.

Going to buy Razer products from now on.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|This film is easily among the best I have seen in my lifetime. It is everything I stated it to be in my title to this review. The way they worked in elements of foreshadowing of what may come to be(which is done in a creative way so that if they were to do a sequel, and I PRAY they do, that they could either tell another new tale that fits between this story and the original \\"THE WIZARD OF OZ\\" movie[or the even better, in my opinion, \\"THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ\\"<br />book] or just jump right into what I assume would be a reimagining of the first tale in Baum's \\"OZ\\" series) is truly masterful storytelling! This movie is just so full of everything! It has, at its heart, a beautiful story<br />about love, compassion, hope, and courage(all<br />the while making a very profound statement that there is more to a person than meets the eye when it comes to realizing his \\"greatness\\", and that sometimes that very person is the last one to see it; and if or when he comes to this realization and sees himself as he truly is instead of who he falsely relegated himself to being, he can find his self-worth and do truly \\"great\\" things, even if those things weren't what he had envisioned for himself and his future; thus finding true happiness). All that being said, this is one heck of a fun movie! It has thrills and more than a few chills! It truly is genre-bending. Yes, at its core it is a \\"FANTASY\\" film. And I guess that maybe that is all you could call it IF you call a movie that includes elements of horror & suspense mixed with comedy, drama, action, and a dose of romance for good measure to be labeled as simply \\"FANTASY\\". The rollercoaster ride you go on with \\"OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL\\" is full of twists and turns, loops and corkscrews! One minute you're laughing, and BAM! Just like that, you're jumping out of your seat with startling fear! Or, you may be gripping your seat, gritting your teeth, and squinching your eyes as you watch on in breathless anticipation during a frightful action sequence, only to suddenly relax that death-grip you have<br />on your armrest and feel your jaw literally drop and your eyes widen in amazement as you gape in awe at the wonderously imaginitive scenery of serene and baffling beauty that is now a visual, auditory, and stunningly mind-blowing feast for the senses! As your breathing steadies and the giddiness begins to wind down, you are now treated to a delightfully charming scene that ranges from witty dialogue and banter to downright gut-busting humor that leaves you wiping a tear from your eye from having laughed so hard. Next up, for your viewing experience, be prepared to ponder and let the story just wash over you as you are treated to some of the most moving cinematic moments one could ever hope for. This is where you might be wiping away those tears again, if not from your love of the characters and their predicaments(which are presented in an honest, beautiful, and meaningful manner, never trying too hard to pry the tears from our eyes in a \\"tear-jerker\\" sort of way- this is where the major drama comes in), then a few tears may be shed for the moments of romance, that whether most men admit or not, can push those emotional buttons that can moisten even the dryest of eyes and soften even tje hardest of hearts. Now, prepare to experience ALL of that over and over again(only in varrying order). Yep, this movie is packed with  all of the elements that can, any one of them(action & adventure, comedy, romance, etc) make for an entertaining film. It's just that you get the \\"All-in-One\\" experience with this movie. The story is AMAZING due to the perfectly paced and wonderfully diverse plot elements and themes that are presented, having something for everyone to enjoy! The acting is fantastic all the way around, from James Franco's portrayal of OZ- done with dynamism and gusto(he is clearly enjoying himself here) to Mila Kunis' wonderfully eccentric performance that captures her character's(and I won't spoil just who that is for those who haven't seen or heard about it yet)somewhat unstable, but truly<br />tender, caring, loving, yet emotionally naive traits(that last one having a TREMENDOUS affect on her character's arc in the story). Everyone involved with this picture- director, producers, actors, special effects studios, et al- ALL did an<br />excellent job. Finally, it is the special effects guys<br />and gals that I would like to give my ENORMOUS<br />thanks! Without these special people, a movie<br />like this could never be made, and especially not<br />made with the INCREDIBLE talent that shines<br />through in this film, really bringing you into OZ<br />and OZ out to you! I say this because aside from<br />the \\"normal special effects\\" being amazing  the 3D in \\"OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL\\" is truly a<br />sight to behold! It is as good, if not better than any other 3D movie I have seen...EVER! And I have probably seen about every 3D movie to date. My brother & I have amassed a collection of Blu-ray 3D movies that is gargantuan in<br />nature! We have nearly every single one that<br />had been released to date. And the ones that<br />are still at the theaters or just haven't been<br />released on Blu-ray 3D yet, such as this one, we<br />have seen those too & anxiously await the good<br />ones when they are released on Blu-ray 3D<br />format. We saw \\"OZ\\" in IMAX 3D, which is THE<br />BEST way to expetience a 3D movie. The only<br />thing that compares(and maybe even surpasses<br />in some ways) is watching a Blu-ray 3D<br />film(particularly one that excells in all its 3D<br />aspects, both \\"positive\\" & \\"negative\\" parallax-<br />also known as \\"in-screen effects\\" &<br />\\"out-of-screen effects\\" AKA: \\"Depth\\" & \\"Pop\\", as well as having little or no \\"ghosting\\" or \\"cross-talk\\" or \\"banding\\" or \\"edge enhancement\\", and having an overall extremely sharp, colorful, crystal-clear picture) on a tv that exemplifies all<br />of these things. My brother's 55\\" LED LG 3D TV<br />qualifies. I am only pointing this out because<br />how good a movie looks, particularly when it<br />comes to 3D, depends highly on what kind of 3D<br />tv you are watching it on. Other aspects such as<br />lighting in the room(it should be as pitch-black<br />as possible) can also be variables that affect<br />your 3D viewing experience. As I stated earlier,<br />my brother and I saw \\"OZ\\" in IMAX 3D. If you<br />hear from someone that they saw this in 3D and<br /> it wasn't that great(3D wise), ask them if they<br />saw it in \\"regular\\" 3D or \\"REAL-D\\" 3D. Odds are that they did. Now, I have heard only good<br />things about this movie's 3D quality in ALL its 3D<br />theatrical forms of viewing. But people who saw<br />it in both \\"REAL-D\\" 3D & IMAX 3D have all said<br />that IMAX is the best. I'm saying all of this because I assume that if you are on this page and looking at reviews for \\"OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL\\" Blu-ray 3D, that you are considering buying it. I just want to give you an idea of what you are in for in terms of the movie itself, but also of the technical aspects. I have watched a movie at the IMAX 3D & then watched the same movie at home on the LG and the viewing experience has almost always been identical in 3D & picture quality- a few movies looked even BETTER at home on the LG(if you are debating on getting a 3D tv, I would say difinitively \\"YES, GET ONE\\"; but get the BEST one out there right now, and that would be the one my brother bought; after doing extensive research and comparing the different 3D tvs with our own eyes, we found that \\"passive lens\\" technology is better than\\"active or shutter lens\\" technology. All theaters use passive lens technology screens and glasses- even IMAX has converted from active to passive. Even still, if you decide to go with passive, not all passive tvs are equal. I would advise doing your own research and trying out the different kinds for yourself. But I would HIGHLY recommend the 55\\" LED LG 3D TV). But the experience of watching the \\"OZ\\" movie at the IMAX 3D and feeling TOTALLY immersed with the perfect combination of \\"pop\\" & \\"depth\\", I can't wait to experience that incredible feeling and watch the AWESOME that is \\"OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL\\" 3D!

B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I was kind of disappointed about this movie.  The actors were great - very funny delivery.<br /><br />However, the characters and story line are not believable.  Just not people most middle class folks can really relate to.  Was kinda hoping for a woman dealing with perimenopause and a flabby, fat body like most of us.  Perfect house, perfect body, perfect faces...just a drag... Yeah, they have some financial issues and, shucks,  an unexpected pregnancy (another slam for those who have to deal with infertility), but cripe, they still have it made....cry me a river.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|OK, might as well stick in my 2¢-worth I suppose:<br /><br />The violence, bouncing boobs, sex and incest don't bother me per se; sometimes they're laid on so thick it just makes me laugh.  But past a certain point, they do bore me.  I suppose they're trying to cast their net for the audience as wide as possible.<br /><br />And I, too, am irritated by pointless deviations from the original story &mdash; in which Season 2 is indeed much worse than Season 1.<br /><br />These considerations aside, this series has much to recommend it.  For a start, the acting is almost uniformly first rate: if I had to award just one Oscar, it would go to the Casting Director.  A second would go for Special Effects, and a third for title music.<br /><br />This script is crisp and entertaining, too, and &mdash; a definite benefit over reading the books &mdash; you don't have to put up with the author's appalling grammar.<br /><br />No, it's not perfect, but my wife and I both look forward to it very much &mdash; and she HATES fantasy, I had to twist her arm into even giving it a chance.<br /><br />So 5 stars from me.
B004026L02|5.0|I read other reviews carefully before purchasing these and while I do agree that they run a little large, the strap in the back seems to still keep these on my daughter's feet well, even with them being a tad big.  She wore them all day the first day they arrived with no blisters or marks from them rubbing on her feet, which we usually get with sandals.  Time will tell if they hold up but for now, we're incredibly pleased.

0684857219|5.0|&#34;The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding&#34; is a great read for anyone that is looking to get into any sort of strength building program, looking to increase your muscle size, or to gain in-depth knowledge when it comes to exercise in general.<br /><br />Some of the information is outdated, though. Keep in mind that this isn't really a &#34;modern&#34; book, but most of the information is still applicable to exercise today.<br /><br />As a Certified Fitness Trainer through the International Sports Science Association, I suggest any fitness enthusiast -- even other trainers -- to pick up this book. It'll brush up on information from the perspective of a bodybuilder himself, and maybe help you retain knowledge since it is displayed in different ways.<br /><br />There are a *TON* of pictures, and not just illustrations, either, so you know exactly what you're looking for when it comes to the literature.<br /><br />The book is well-written and contains a ton of information. If you're into exercise, just do yourself a favor and purchase this book.

B0045HCJRG|5.0|'Blast from the Past' is one of those silly little films that gets a big boost from a very enthusiastic cast. The premise is a bit far fetched, but kooky scientist father Christopher Walken makes everything seem fairly plausible. Sissy Spacek plays his loving wife with superb comic ability and timing.<br /><br />The story of the above couple who escape (from what they think is the drop of \\"The Big One\\" )to their fall out shelter buried deep under their backyard is both silly and heartwarming. The film is part fish out of water and part romantic comedy and with the help of Brendan Frazer and lovely Alicia Silverstone as a modern day Adam and Eve so to speak, this film stays entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />Dave Foley plays Silverstone's gay BFF and he certainly adds a lot of hilarity in his supporting role. It's just one of those films that really grows on you if you're into such things. The 5 stars all turn in excellent and funny performances. The DVD has some interesting extras and the transfer looks decent, but this film is due for an upgrade.

The story is long, but never boring and even though it takes time to develop, it's like a simmering pot that we all know is going to explode at some point!..and when the pot does explode, it explodes like no other superhero movie has ever done!<br /><br />First off having Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, The Black Widow and Nick Fury in one movie seemed impossible to give each character their due, but The Avengers does just that,(Fury could have been better utilized and I can't get used to Jackson playing the part.) I grew up with the scruffy cigar chomping BADA$$ white guy version from the 60's), but this film pulls off the impossible! I never once looked at my watch in it's two hour and twenty five minute length. Besides having a very ambitious story the action sequences are the best I've ever seen in a film of this nature.<br /><br />The film has many comic moments which had the entire audience roaring with laughter with the Hulk (who is properly sized for once) delivering in spades this time around ( I guess they owed the character that much after two sub-par feature films). He and Robert Downey Jr. steal the show and give us those classic moments a popcorn film of this magnitude needs to keep everyone focused in on the fact that this is a film about comic book characters. Each character is given time to shine and having origin films for the main quadrant helps a great deal. I can't imagine how they're going to top this one?!<br /><br />The Avengers rivals the very best of all comic book films including Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins and the 3D (which I usually find distracting) is the best I've ever seen. Trailers for the new Spider Man reboot and Batman films were also presented in 3D. Even if you're not really into superhero films, this is the summer's must see movie. Get a tub of popcorn and prepare for an incredible movie experience!.... and you WILL want to stay ALL the way to the end of the film as there is a false ending showing one of Marvel's Heavy Weight Villains before a funny ending scene a few minutes later. I hope Marvel reboots the Fantastic Four with a CGI Thing that could at least give the Hulk a fair battle.<br /><br />The four disc Blu Ray edition is very nice, but one small gripe, they stacked two of the disk top of each other, which I find really cheap for a set that cost this much. I mean really?, how much does a swinging hinge cost? I bought the tin collector's set at Best Buy and quickly gave them a new home in the superior case. Though the new case didn't have room for the digital copy, which  don't use any way. The transfer looks and sounds fantastic with bonus material a plenty.seen.

B000I9UA8U|4.0|If you like British movies, and I do, See the Full Monty. It is very funny. Robert Carlyle (now seen on Once Upon a Time) is a wonderful actor as were his cast mates on the Monty. See it you will enjoy it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It is awesome<br />&sect; The first time since I've got to prestige of this year ago by an average American people raise awareness about the rock and the chocolate
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I highly recomend to reed this book before you start writing your first kindle book. I wish you luck for your first publish :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really cool game but when I tried to update it it wouldn't work I would<br />recommend it though
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written, portrayed and delivered. This storyis beautifully set and depicted in turn of the century England focused upon the daily activities of a societal  &#34;upper-crust&#34; family and their household care staff. Thoroughly enjoy the contrast aspects of lives separated by &#34;station&#34; but woven together & connected by &#34;basic&#34; human needs.<br />If you enjoy &#34;period pieces&#34; (eg &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34;), this will indeed become a &#34;favorite addiction&#34;....

B007N8RULO|3.0|I like the game, but I do not like the constant popup adverts between each session.  They are hard to get rid of in most cases.  The menu for selecting preferences is also hard to find.
B009IEXKXI|1.0|First off, this is the type of book/subject I would normally enjoy a lot.  But it stinks.  A million pages devoted to growing potatoes.  I understand why this is important to the story, but it could have been told in about 1/2 million less pages.  The constant use of the \\"F\\" word is just boring.  Does the author think this makes him, or the lead character look cool?  It only makes them look uneducated.  Paragraph after paragraph devoted to body waste functions also just gets boring.  I again understand why this is necessary to the story, but not in this detail.  Did the author have trouble with potty training.<br /><br />When I read the description of this book, my first thought was this was written for me.  But it wasn't.<br /><br />I'm serious about the 929 five stars reviews.  Do this mean the review system has been hacked?  Or every one in the author's hometown was paid to write a review?  I can't belive 929 people even finished this book.  What a waste of a great story idea.  He should have sold the idea to an real author.
1936608898|5.0|This book has changed my lifestyle. I think differently about food now and since starting my reading, I've lost 20lbs in the last month as well.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I love playing the piano and taking lessons so I was very excited to get this it's really fun I play it every day. Get it u won't be sorry!
0385349947|4.0|This book is interesting, full of research and anecdotes, and is a great conversation starter. Alot of the criticism of it in the mass media has to be by people who haven't really read it; if they had, they'll know she addresses much of the issues they mention. I think Sandberg does a wonderful job telling a great story, providing tips and advice, and empowering middle to upper class women.<br /><br />Of course this book completely overlooks the plight of lower class women and, except for a few instances, neglects the experiences of women of color. It is moving the feminist dialogue away from one of social justice and empowering all women to the idea that if SOME women can make it to the top, they can then push forward all women... which is not necessarily true.<br /><br />That said, I didn't expect Sheryl Sandberg to write a book about the poorest women and their challenges. I expected her to write a book about her experiences and she certainly did that. I think this is a insightful book for men and women, especially men who manage women.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is hard but very fun, I really like this game.  Very good game you guys keep it up.
B009R659L8|1.0|I've read and enjoyed all MHC books. This dialogue is incredibly stilted and juvenile sounding.  Sounds like it was run through some type of &#34;personality stripper.&#34; Can't even make myself read it -- sorry I wasted $10.99 on this! Almost laughable
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A fascinating look behind the headlines of the lives of the dedicated SEAL warriors.  Truly a life style few of us would want to live. Not only is the operation to eliminate Bin Laden described in detail, but also many lesser known &#34;routine&#34; operations, as well as the intense training and equiping that make up the everyday lives of SEALs.  Lots of questions about how the Bin Laden operation went down are answered, except one - never did find out what the cause of the helicopter crash was.  But on the whole a very good read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Loved this game on Facebook & now love it on my Kindle Fire. Smooth game play, lots of bonuses,free 5 rounds in a daily tournament,awesome daily bonuses. I love this game!!!!!
0307346617|5.0|it feels like it really happened<br />the cronicles of a war on the zombies and many survival and failure stories
B002XBVQKW|4.0|I like this version of the musical, but if you have children, you might want to consider that it has some strong language and violent content. That being said, it is one of my favorite films!
1400049628|5.0|it stablishes the starteguies to survieve in a zobie enviorement<br />but some are also very useful tacttics for war and actual survival
0811874192|5.0|This is one of my best decorating purchases.  Everyone who comes to my home comments on how unique & pretty the paper blossoms are.  I love how I can change the pages to another floral design whenever the mood hits.  I would definitely order another one if something ever happened to my beautiful table topper!
B00BWU0S3Q|4.0|Deffentaly a movie worth checking out! Although i expected a little more out of the plot but still a must see.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|Always loved this movie.  Even the parts that look dated don't deter me anymore.  Anyone who saw this movie before seeing \\"Jurassic Park\\" knows they are fundamentally the same story:  \\"Don't mess with technology you can't fully control.\\"  It's a cautionary tale about man's hubris.<br /><br />Anyone besides me notice the misspelled word on the front-cover artwork?  Error is visible in the pic but the product itself had no such error.  Curious.<br /><br />With this new transfer for Blu-ray, the film looks sharper and cleaner than I've ever seen it.  Disc comes with a brief behind-the-scenes featurette and the first episode of the short-lived \\"Beyond Westworld\\" TV series from 1980, which starred absolutely no one from \\"Westworld\\" or \\"Futureworld\\".
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie is amazing! It is exactly the opposite of what you expect after looking at the cover and reading the summary on the back, but it is still nonetheless an extraordinary film! Filled with beautiful cinematography and a very surprising twist at the end, this movie should definitely get a nod for &#34;Best Picture of the Year.&#34;
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book was very interesting and well written.  I especially enjoyed the parts his wife wrote from her perspective.  The descriptions of being in combat were informative and gives us some flavor of what goes through your mind when people are shooting at you.  Of course I was very sad that Chris was killed back in Texas trying to help a fellow soldier.  Anyway I'm always happy to support our troops and  wish his family peace and comfort.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway is great. I learn about the city's and states all the time. And the theme is always different. It is fun but it does kind of have a bad meaning. But for an overall experience I gave it 5 stars.!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was alright, but I've read better.  Didn't like how it ended.  It was a little slow and I was hoping the story would pick up, but it didn't.  Not my favorite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. just wow.<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect when starting this but I knew I had to read it right away because I absolutely loved Slammed and Point of Retreat. It exceeded any expectations I had. Easily one of my favorite books of the year. The story was so touching and had me guessing the entire time I was reading. I was almost positive I knew the way the story was going to play out and was proved wrong with a seriously shocking and great twist. This book was written with so much emotion it was literally jumping off of the pages and consuming me. I am so glad this was released early because I was already having a hard time waiting for this!<br /><br />5++ stars. Another success by Colleen Hoover.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Tony Stark- self centered, intelligent, handsome, sarcastic, superhero. Clears up any questions one would have if your not familiar with the characters. Love the love/hate relatinship of Tony and Pepper. The rush of adrenaline.
B00AW0KGYI|3.0|I love the extra 8 minutes. The reason I gave it 3* instead of 5* is, because I could not redeem the digital copy with the code.  Can anyone help me with that?
B003719G40|5.0|This book addresses the issues most couples do not. Gary Chapman provides answers to the questions men and women don't ask, but should. If you need help in your marriage or want to get it off to a great start...this is the book!!! Great read!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love Skyfall! This is a great action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'm glad I bought it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story will stay with me for a long time.  The author really makes you question what you would do and how far you would go in defense of one you love.  It's a personal view showing us how people think, reason, and maybe even lie to themselves.  The end of the book was spectacular...leaving many questions unanswered...food for thought.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great pass time.  I play everyday for hours of fun on my Kindle Fire HD.  I recommend this Bingo app for everyone. One of the best apps on my Kindle.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|This review is from: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (Amazon Instant Video)<br />It hasn't gotten much acclaim I the states, but this film is really good.. I would recommend this product and the seller!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever read!!! I love America Singer!!!  This book is for girls dreaming of being princesses everywhere!!!  Can't wait for book three ;)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I am a picky reader.  I have no problems putting a book down and walking away if I can't get into it.  This book I read in 3 nights.  I loved the writing and stayed fully engaged the whole time.  I am kind of interested in seeing the movie...<br />Well done.  I am going to read Mr quick next book. Hope it is as good..
B0060MYM3S|5.0|You get this for DVD player and it looks like for the computer to (for those that want to view on computer/tablet/etc.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great just wish you could earn gems rather than purchase.<br /> My children love the game and easy to understand for littlle kiddos.
0857680986|5.0|Do yourself a favor & get this & the rest of the Loomis books. There is absolutely no way you will ever regret it. Long out of print, they're finally available to the wise and lucky buyer. I guarantee these books will always be among your very favorites on your shelf for a life time!
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I especially loved that I could see some footage from the 70's that I hadn't seen in forever.  Leon<br />Russell was great in this and Jesse Ed Davis and of course, a very young Clapton, and all the rest.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just love this calculator!! It is big and easy to use. It keeps the numbers<br />on the screen so that you can see exactly what you have put in.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Another gorgeous film from Peter Jackson.  Lots of details in both the characters and the scenery.  I can't wait for the next two films in the series.  I haven't read the book yet but have it in my library.  After The Lord of the Rings, I trust Peter Jackson's skills in closely following a wonderful story.

B004T32SOK|5.0|My daughter found this app for me and I am enjoying storing pictures to my kindle to show off of my granddaughters.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|This book was great. Very heavy and emotional, but one of the first novels where I have actually seen the mind of the person with disordered eating, rather than a reflection of a healthy person trying to describe it. The epilogue is perfect and positive in a way that makes real sense.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|I loved the soundtrack! The battle tracks were epic and captured each fight perfectly! The lyrics from each song were awesome as well cause they were well written and had meaning.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I liked the ending..finally happened! Too bad rand didn't stay with his women tho! Just another dead beat dad! Lol
0671434004|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves it. Now he doesn't have to borrow it from the library now.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game and so did my children we all loved the graphics I will say that my teenagers ages 15 &amp;16 both felt that the map should be placed by itself  to know where to go for the next location.
B00BO2VKBG|5.0|This band continues to amaze me, they sound like they are straight from the 70's but in a good way. If you even remotely like Black Sabbath you will love Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats. I love how they have some songs that are at a faster tempo then Blood lust, they also have a couple songs that don't fit into the Doom metal label UA&TD have been given. This band continues to evolve and not sound like 90% of the b.s. you hear on the radio. Beautiful guitars, rumbling bass, sweet harmonies, and tight drums will excite your ears. Right now my favorite songs are &#34;Death Valley Blues&#34;, &#34;Devil's Work&#34;, and &#34;Poison Apple&#34;. Until Queens of the Stone Age new CD releases or Tool (if that ever happens...) this is my album of the year! Uncle Acid can control my mind any day :).
0345803485|3.0|Does anyone know someone who is virgin and when finaly has sex has orgasme each time?  Unfortunatelly this story is no belivable on many points, the people are all good looking, Ana is THE perfect girl and all the men wants her.  Christian is VERY good looking, he is rich and can play piano and pilote an helicopter and can make women orgasme each time, and on and on...., his only problem was a s*** mother and no beeing able to be touch (but even this didn't last long)  So MR and MRS perfect end up together playing happy familly.  wished a sadder end more belivable!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game. It is my all time favorite bingo app (and I currently have 7), but this one I play everyday. I do occasionally have trouble with it freezing up, not too much, not enough to make me quit! Gotta go, I hear blitzy calling my name!!!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This CD has just about every Phil Collins song you could possibly want. Best value for your money. Excellent quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game i ever played it is fun it has the best graphics I have ever played
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|The whole argument about Silver Springs being left off the original album because of time limitations is completely retarted nonsense on the band's part and especially Warner Bros.  Even with that song included on the album would have still been barely 45 minutes long.  Someone at the record company should have been fired for allowing that to happen.  I have countless LPs that are 45 minutes and longer.  What else can be said about Rumours that hasn't already been said?  One of the all time great albums by one of the all time greatest bands.  However, it could have been even better at the time if Silver Springs was on it.  They could have at least swapped it with I Don't Want To Know if they were worried about it being too long.  That was the only weak song on here.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A spellbound romantic novel, that stands the test of time. Dirty secrets, lust, love and rich. You won't want to put it down.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Really like this game, agree it is better than the other temple games, colors are vivid to black and white, I like how you can go to different lands through a yellow, flashing tube, and the further I get the faster it goes. Continues to be challenging and look forward to playing,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thus games is really fun and good, but I really don't like the fact that that you can't update the app on the kindle fire, without deleting the app, than getting again, it really bothers me.
1400052181|5.0|I'm a junior in college, and I read this book for my class, Medicine, Healing, and Experimentation.  Never before had I heard of Henrietta Lacks or her cells, but as soon as I began reading, I could not put the book down! The way Skloot incorporates the family's story with scientific research facilitates not only an intellectual, but also a visceral connection to Henrietta.  And delving deep into the consciousness of HeLa cell researchers at Johns Hopkins, she examines how and why they endeavored to manipulate the Lacks family.<br /><br />This fantastic narrative generated stimulating discussion on informed consent and morality in research.  I suggest it to anyone - regardless of his or her affiliation with the medical field.
B000063JDE|5.0|This is a hard to find movie.Children probably shouldnt watch it,but I think most adults should watch it because it shows just how close good and bad are to each other.People should watch it for the educational value of it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This was a good book and I would really recommend this book to everyone who likes a good book because this is the one
B00002MZ4V|5.0|seller was true to their word.  Sent on time and in excellent condition.  John Williams has really created music to be remembered.  A favorite is the theme to Jaws.  Only takes two notes and you know what it is and you can see yourself moving throught the water at the opening of the movie.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|awesome price for a great complete series.  She has already started watching it and is bery grateful for the gift.
B00BEJOMIW|4.0|I like this film. A lot. The screenplay by pre-\\"Godfather\\" Francis Ford Coppola is a reminder of the 70s, when films wanted to be literature and EVERY film had to last over two hours. That said, I ordered the Blu-ray version hoping the film might get a remastering. It doesn't seem so. The DVD version had visible grain and occasional specks and flecks. So does this 2013 Blu-ray edition. So, if you have the DVD, you have the Blu-ray; this is a straight transfer from whatever source the DVD used. Still, it's one attractive film. Bonus features? None, which is unbelievable considering how virtually the entire cast is still alive and many of them are still working. I'm pretty sure no one asked them, either. Although Paramount owns the film, the Blu-ray release was produced by Warners. A guess: even with the much-delayed but about-to-be-released 2013 Baz Lurhman film just around the corner, Paramount had no plans to take advantage of interest in their own 40-year old film. Warners, I assumed, stepped in and they made some sort of bare bones arrangement.<br /><br />So, this literate and carefully-paced classic ( just short of two and a half hours long) gets a very disinterested Blu-ray release. No extras, no commentaries, no remastering, and not even a booklet/insert card. Just the film, and even that comes with the skimpiest of menus.<br /><br />Fun facts: Sam Waterston got a Golden Globe nomination for his performance - as Most Promising Newcomer.<br /><br />I'm hoping someone gets the smart idea to finally release Nelson Riddle's score - the one he got his only Oscar for - on CD.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My daughter had to do a report on this movie and she was able to do so and get a good grade!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I enjoyed the way this movie peeled thin layers away from the onion of mental illness, depression, and learning how to love again after loss. Lawrence and Cooper both put in academy award winning performances. The writing pulled you into the story in ways that were purposefully uncomfortable and engaging. The frenzy of Cooper's mania/anxiety was transmitted into my bones - I was on the verge of walking out because it was so real that it affected me in a visceral way. Progressing through the movie, the energy changed immensely and is reflective of the storyteller and director's ability to bring that story to life. Kudos.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Very heartfelt and moving performances.  The whole setting is really great and beautiful to view as it moves along the storyline.
B004RE29PO|5.0|brutal fast action take on the classic Aliens franchise. if you like sci fi and haven't seen/bought this movie you need to get this now
098357670X|5.0|Words cannot express how awesome and mind-blowing this book is.  Tom is a true artist as he teaches you to SEE as well as how to draw!  I've spend hundreds of dollars on art books in the past, from life drawing to character design to animals and everything in between.  The book seemed a bit pricey at first, but he really jam-packed value into this book!  So many pages are covered in stunning full color images, such an inspiration.<br /><br />He starts by explaining what &#34;caricature&#34; is, the subjectivity of it vs. the objectivity of portraiture, then goes through feature by feature and explains what to look for.  This is the best example of &#34;teach a man to fish rather than just give him a fish&#34; in an art book ever.  It's like a stylized version of the amazing &#34;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&#34;.<br /><br />My only complaint... why stop at caricature, Tom?  I would pay hundreds to see Tom Richmond publish books on animals, stylized life drawing, backgrounds, character design... I want to learn it ALL from this guy!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Would like to see a map of just Indiana with a movement of weather & showing how storms are moving how fast & what counties are under warnings
630587493X|4.0|i like this movie because it had a story line that realized the human condition so well that i almost missed the fact that time,technoligy and people are not at that level yet.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|\\"Excellent\\" pretty much says it all. The performance is, of course, awesome, and the video quality excellent. Who could ask for anything more?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It actually lived up to the hype. It was well written and not just some smutt like I expected. I'm excited to see what happens in the 2nd book.
B005ELQVGW|4.0|I've been a fan of Bjork since she was the lead singer of the Sugarcubes.  I enjoy this album.  It's different and experimental.  I really like the sound of all the different instruments.  Excellent musicianship.  I wish Bjork would switch things up a little though, because unlike Debut and some of her earlier solo work, the last 2 albums can sound quite monotonous, and homogenous as a whole. I'd like to hear more beats-slow or fast or anything.  Something that will make me want to get up and move.  Otherwise, I think Bjork continues to be a musical genius.
0783219733|5.0|I looked for this movie for a while. I found the other Beethovens that can after the original, but not this one. Yeah, so funny when his leash drags the bad one down the street, just as funny now as back when the movie came out years ago.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I had gotten the first in this series by accident in paperback form from our local public library and after purchasing my kindle decided to try the second one...I loved it and am looking forward to the third book coming out in June!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Happy sad terrible AMAZING!!! I don't know what to say but thank u kierra cass for writing this and hurry up on the third book I don't know how long I can wait!!!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Okay this game is FUN really fun BUT.....I had major problems with it. It is in the Kindle App store and it does not work well with the Kindle Fire the first time I played it I got about 7 ponies and the game crashed when I went toplay it only showed half the screen so I reset my Kindle....EVERYTHING GONE! So I removed and and downloaded it again by the way for some reason it would not connect to Facebook or ANYONE it would crash when I went on social. This time I got ten ponies...same thing happened again I turned it off and turned it back on screen became normal BUT again EVERTHING WAS LOST MY JEWLS MY PONIES EVERYTHING. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE KINDLE PERIOD!I did get my mony back through Amazon. It's really sad because this game was indeed very fun. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE KINDLE. My friend had problems on his ipad the same problem as mine! What is wrong with this game? and why not put it on Facebook? I would play it on there another thing it is expensive REALLY expensive so if you can afford...$60 for one pony play it just know that it may crash and you'll lose all of your things and will have to start back on level one. So BUYERS BEWARE!!!
0230749429|5.0|The book arrived well ahead of time and in excellent condition. Comliments to the supplier for their work in this . It is a great story that blends the personal with the historical, making it truly believable and very interesting. It moves along well and for over 800 pages, was a quick read which was easy to pick up from where last read up to. The characters are well constructed and their stories are thoughtfully intertwined over the years covered in the book, principally just pre,during and immediately post WW1. I am looking forward to the next in the series and am now a fan of Ken Follett. All in all a most enjoyable book.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|I loved this movie.  I had trouble finding this at local retailers and was able to find this very easily here.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book.... loved the plot and the ending .would love to read another book by this great author... well written<br />.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The story gets tedious. It unfolds so slowly and then over just a page or two, it all unfolds. I did enjoy the characters very much. I have read many of this author's books and have enjoyed them very much.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|OMG. This book may be the first one but it gets better and better the more you read.THIS IS A BOOK THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061950726|4.0|Molly Ayer is a foster kid, trying to make do with the life she's been dealt. At seventeen, she's been bounced around from one family to another; none of them a home. Her current situation is no better. Willful and defiant, she often argues with her foster parents and when she steals a book from the library, she finds herself in a boatload of trouble.  Her friend, Jack, finds her a community service opportunity helping an elderly lady clean out her attic. Molly's not too excited about spending all those hours helping a perfect stranger. But as Molly gets to know Vivian and the history contained within those boxes, Molly begins to realize that they have more in common than she thought.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating chapters and takes us from Vivian's story in 1929, to Molly's story which takes place in 2011. Vivian's story is absolutely heartbreaking. Losing her family in a fire, Niamh (pronounced Neev) is placed aboard a train of orphans. The train stops in each town with the hopes of finding homes for the children aboard. Niamh, at ten years of age is already considered too old to adopt. If she finds a home at all she is guaranteed  life of hard labor. Whether it be taking care of children or working her fingers to the bone doing mending or cleaning or whatever else comes to mind. She also quickly realizes that she won't be able to retain the name given to her by her family. Her fierce red hair and Irish descent raises an eyebrow everywhere she goes so when a family steps up and offers her a place in their home as a seamstress, she quickly learns that she'll be Dorothy. Something that she is forced to accept and a practice that is repeated until she settles on the permanent name of Vivian.<br /><br />Vivian's story is riveting, but as sad as it was to read about her poor living conditions as a child. I found myself gravitating towards her chapters more so than Molly's. Molly is difficult to like. She assumes the role of troublemaker by dying her hair dark, wearing a nose ring and playing the all-around bad girl. Only those very close to her know that she's not that way. Her friend Jack for one, and perhaps her guidance counselor, but her story did not pull me in as much as Vivian's, so I didn't feel as connected to Molly as I wanted to be.<br /><br />However, when these two unlikely characters meet, Kline does a good job of weaving between the two stories and figures out how to make them come together in a satisfying way. My only quibble, is that the ending was a tad rushed and perhaps, too convenient.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a riveting story and highly readable. I should mention that these trains actually existed. Yes, I know, it's hard to believe but it's true which of course makes the story even more interesting.dark, wearing a nose ring and playing the all-around bad girl.

B005ZUR724|3.0|I love the game itself. I would give it 5 stars but I continuously get booted out of the game. and it has a lot of  glitches.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Very clever with amazing actors. I can't wait for new season to come about and see what they will come up next.
B00BIBSTJ4|5.0|I've been a huge fan of just about every soundtrack to a Tarantino film that's been released and this is no exception. Though surprisingly this is his first film to feature multiple tracks made specifically for the film and they're just icing on the cake of an already great list of tracks. Now with this vinyl release music lovers and collector's both are in for a real treat. This version features the soundtrack laid out over two LPs that are white with a blood soaked design and it truly does look stunning. Now many have complained about the retail price of this being $45, however if you're smart you'll notice quite a few sellers on here parting with it for less. I personally only paid $30 for this and I consider it money very well spent. The vinyl sounds amazing and the presentation of the whole package is one of the best I've ever seen for a movie soundtrack. I highly recommend this release to anyone who wants a little something special with their soundtrack.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|How can you not love it, Jessica Lange at her best playing the psychotic nun.  Totally deserves an Emmy! Brava!
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This movie was a hilarious, and still gory twist on the traditional horror film. The casting was perfect and I am hopeful that there will be a sequel. The perspective shifts were very well done and refreshing!
B007REV4YI|4.0|One of the better Bond movies.  True special effects and not all done digitally!  Aston Martin fands will die!  A keeper!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was so disappointed because Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy is an amazing story.  If I would have watched this version of Anna Karenina first, I would have never cared to read the book.  But I did read it first, and this film does not do it justice by far.  The theatrical presentation of the story is bothersome.  It does not work.<br /><br />If you saw this version of the story, and you were turned off by it, I would suggest that you not judge the book by its movie.  Do read it.  You will have a completely different perspective of Anna Karenina.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|We love anything LOTR, and this movie is  beautifully shot with great background and imaginative animation that fits in seamlessly with the rest of the movie.  You will be on the edge of your seat.  It is a somewhat tamer story than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as were the books.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app for kids. Lots of advertisements.  Easy for kids ages 4 and up especially sweet for horse lover's. Fun!
1452115567|5.0|I got this for my husband and a friend all that have coon dogs.  Having a coon dog I believe all pic are real, they are the best  and friendly dogs. This book is a great table book and a great conversation piece.
0240815807|4.0|Thorough, down-to-earth explanations and a reasonable methodology for approaching the various mix steps, plus he makes fun of Morrissey in one droll aside, I found the style engaging, text is well illustrated and the downloadable examples let you hear what's being described/discussed. Senor Senior has done a fine job.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|It's a shame rem has called it a day. I think their last two cd's they were getting back to what made them great. Awesome band.
B004YJZBCK|5.0|WOW THIS IS THE BEST AUDIO FIDELITY CD I'VE EVER HEARD. THIS IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD STRAIGHT SHOOTER.THE SOUND QUALITY IS UNREAL......WORTH EVERY PENNY FOR THE COST OF THIS CD ALONE. THE ARTWORK IS ACCEPTABLE. BUT THE SOUND IS WERE IT'S AT.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS CD..........
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I was looking online for a used Seiko diver's watch and the prices they were getting for a used watch of unknown origin with an unknown history from someone on an island somewhere in the Pacific was incredible in my opinion.  It was at that point I began to look online for a new product with a company that would back up the watch if something was wrong.  Seiko watches can't be beat for accuracy and quality and come at a price point I can live with.  I've had this watch for a couple weeks now and after the first week it  lost only 3 seconds.  I had to double check so I waited another week and it lost 2 seconds.  This is incredible for an automatic watch.  I have watches that cost 5 times the price that don't come anywhere near this for accuracy.  I would have been happy with +- 20 seconds a day.  A classic diver look at a good price with unbelievable accuracy.  I couldn't be happier.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUGHT THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD RUSH!!!!!!!YOU CAN HEAR EVER INSTRUMENT IF THAT ISN'T ENOUGH THE DVD AUDIO OF FLY BY NIGHT IS UNBELIEVABLE!!!! IF YOU'RE A RUSH FAN BUY THIS BOX SET DO IT DO IT DO IT!!!!
B008P9M614|4.0|I bought this series when it was 53% off. Such a bargain, but worth every penny otherwise if you're truly a huge House fan. Every episode is listed with a little description in each case as well as in the booklet with the date it aired. Not only does this have hours and hours of episodes, it also has some hilarious bonus features. The booklet with information on the series, characters, and house-isms is a cool addition as well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this series whether you're someone looking for a good show or a die-hard fan. The only complaint I have is that I wish there was a blu-ray set!
B00AAKVXJM|3.0|First off I think the Vocals on BSCD2 are a little Clearer, However overall sound is a toss up, they both used '93 remaster as the master. I don't think the 93 remaster is the holy grail. For instance I think sony should invest the time and money on a new remaster from the master tapes, with todays technology, I thought the remastering on the greatest hits OH Yea...was some of the best sounding aerosmith I've heard.Especially the older material last child,dream on,walk this way,sweet emotion,same old song and dance etc....So that being said I feel a little short changed on the BSCD2's.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I've had the dvd of this movie since it first became available, but the discounted price of the Blu-ray version wasn't to be passed up. Well, worth the upgrade if you have the choice.
B000006N01|5.0|I RECOMMEND BUYING THIS CD IF YOU LOVE THE STONES......THE ARTWORK IS UNREAL JUST LIKE THE ALBUM, IN A PLASTIC SLIPCASE. I THINK THIS COLLECTORS EDITION IS AWESOME!!!!!!
B000683VI4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Great movie to watch alone or with friends. It is a classic to own.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|FIRST OFF IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE '96-'92 REMASTERS I RECOMMEND THIS BIG TIME. I HAVE ALL THE REMASTERS FROM 1996, I COMPARED THIS VERSION WITH MY 96 VERSION SORRY TO SAY NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE....IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND HAVE THE EARLIER REMASTERS, STICK WITH THEM, IF YOU DON'T I SAY BUY THE NEW REMASTERS FOR THE BONUS MATERIAL........
B000O179A4|5.0|Great movie! I can never get tired of it. However I loan it out and it was not returned. That is how great it is.
B00003CXCQ|3.0|The shipping was on time which was fine. I was aware that the DVD was used but on the inside, the seller had taped the disk to the sleeve because the middle part where the DVD is attached was broken, leaving the little pieces floating around to scratch the DVD. Luckily it seemed to play fine but there is a couple symbols that show up randomly throughout the movie on the top right of the screen, like it is recorded or something? Other than that everything was ok.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|It was amazing and fabulous in every way! I can't watch it without crying.  It is so touching and moving in an awesome kind of way.
B007WPM7SO|4.0|Great love story told through the flashbacks of a British Lt. Durning  WW I.  WW I seems like a distant if not forgotten war and this movie does a good job of reminding us just how insane war but particularly ww I was.  Love keeps men in the trenches in subhuman existence.<br />The British are at their best producing period pieces.  Costumes, scenery, acting, dialog this movie nearly the full package!  Great!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I grew up reading this book over and over. I loved it then and still love it now. Every child should read it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The sharpener comes with two separate sharpening pull throughs, and a sharpening rod for serrated edges. I used the device many times and with practice it gets easier every time.<br /><br />Others have claimed the device is hard to use, it may leave a burr, it has many drawbacks, etc. With any sharpener, especially one of this nature it takes time to learn to use it, become proficient with it and ultimately work out the best use for it.<br /><br />I used several pull sharpeners years ago, one specifically I liked but it didn't have the course and fine grade pulls like this one, and it didn't have the serrated bar either. This one is pretty good it will even sharpen fish hooks from what I understand and that would be good for fishermen.<br /><br />It is compact and rarely needs anything to help it work, it fits into a pack easily or into a pocket for storage.<br /><br />Highly recommend it for a survival pack or tackle box.<br /><br />The only real drawback I see is the size being so small it is sometimes hard to hold onto while you draw a blade across it.
0345803485|5.0|I never considered myself much of a reader, but once I got my hands around this literature, I felt papyrus ecstasy for the first time in my life. As my eyes feasted upon the ink of forbidden lust, I could not help but feel my heart fill with joy for the protagonist and her gigolo. Although this book as been the battlegrounds for many heated debates, it is of my humble opinion that this novel should not go unnoticed. As if if the jacket itself had wings, I could not put this down. Whether by candlelight (a storm took my power out) or the piercing rays of the incandescent bulb in my room, I longed for each page as the characters longed for each other. I would certainly go as far as to say that this author is the next Mary Shelley. Move over Steinbeck, there are some new grapes of wrath to be sown.
076790592X|3.0|I was surprised by the superlative reviews. Its ok. Well written. You can admire his attitude and approach. But in general I found the book to be hardly insightful. May be my expectations were too high.
1452115567|5.0|Once I picked up this book I could not put it down....EVERY picture made me smile and some I even took a second glance at! How on earth this wonderful rescue dog balances on things is beyond understanding sometimes! The pictures are just amazing too...they have a very fun and artsy feel to them. Theron and Maddie make ordinary things take on such a cool feel. This is one of my favorite books I own...everyone who loves a dog needs this book!  I just recently met Theron while doing research for his new book \\"Why We Rescue\\"...I sure do hope my legs make it in the book!! :) I can not wait to see what he has in store for the world of rescue dogs!!
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Just saw the movie today and felt incredibly moved by the music arrangement. The closing song with Susanne Sundfor is amazing!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use my paper dictionary all the time, but I'm taking an extended trip and don't want to haul too much stuff around. So this was a real find. I especially like the vocal pronunciation.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Once again Lee Child has grabbed me by the shirtfront and dragged me through the story, never letting go until the end. I missed two meals and half a night's sleep, living on coffee to keep pace until I finished this book. I may be a minor exception in my reading style, but Lee Child definitely an Exceptional writer!  My advice - have a couple snacks on hand, start on Friday or Saturday. Missed sleep can mess up a work day.  ENJOY!
B008OOYALE|1.0|The game is awful on Kindle &amp; androids. The constant closing is very annoying and so is the ridiculously  long times to do anything not to me to mention the cost.  To top all off its a different game for ios players you get to see them get all the perks that you have pay real money for if it's available for us at all.
B003Y3ZHUS|5.0|I loved this movie. I have been waiting years to see this. The director of Jason Goes to Hell mentions this movie in the bonus features on the Jason X DVD. I did not know that it was released in a different name. (A Bay of Blood. He referred to it as Twitch of the Death Nerve) With a little research I was able to find this movie. Thank you Netflix for having it on instant. I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon. I have read mixed reviews on the quality of the transfer but I gave it a chance. Picture quality is great! Very clear. The sound does go up and down a bit but not to the point of being annoying. The reviews on the Twitch of the Death Nerve version (picture quality and sound) were horrible. I didn't risk it. Overall happy to add this to my collection. The more Italian horror I watch, the more it becomes my favorite. Especially the older movies. My collection is going to continue to grow!
B009O2XY12|2.0|I didn't like it because you had to be on the internet to play.  Not what I expected it to be.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I have it set up to remotely use my computer anywhere see my cams around my house then log on my mom computer to run updates and check disk and all that I'm I life member now that explanation you to rock
B005K17RU0|3.0|No crashes so far or hiccups. Multiple locations can be set and there are little advisory warnings in case of flooding our extreme weather.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love it.  Should recommend to others to play with as having time.<br />Still have some problems like could not get heart gems or give it to friends
1595826971|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE ART BOOK EVER ITS SO BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL AHHHH THANK YOU! It was incredibly beautiful artwork and AMR is my all time favorite game so the book just made everything so much better!
B008393Q2O|5.0|If you are a poet (as I am), a note taker or memo maker, this app is a MUST have.  It has an easy to learn/use interface meaning all you basically have to do is open it and write, write, write--it does everything else for you.
B004G600A4|4.0|This is such a great movie.  Good for the entire family.  As an adult, I really enjoyed it as well and would recommend to all families.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Who knew there is so much to do when building an ebook?  I certainly did not, and while there are many steps to doing this, this book is VERY clear, concise and detail oriented.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Has to be one of the greatest concerts ever.  The disc is crystal clear and it sounds like you are there in the stadium.  Highly recommended if you are a fan of Queen!
1400049628|4.0|Not a bad book to each is own so i liked this book not sure if u will.  its a book to best describe it i would have to say grab a copy and see for yourself everyone has different opions on books

B0063IH60K|5.0|Couldn't ask for more.....great little app......even with all the fancy stuff out there, and mostly free also, I always come back to this one the most!
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I have BIG ideas, a loving heart, yet there was something missing that was keeping me from financial success. It was my conditioning around money. After I did the exercises, I realized that I had a FEAR of making large amounts of money and associated making money with shame based upon some early childhood TRAUMA I experienced around money. Once I realized that these limiting ideas about money were given to me, I realized that I could change my way of thinking and adopt healthy ideas, principles and practices about money that will help me to help more people and CREATE the massive wealth that will help me to do so. FINANCIAL FREEDOM IS WITHIN MY GRASP! IT'S A REALITY! IT IS MINE!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these only while flying. Super light weight so they are very comfortable, much more so than large headphones. Good sound quality. Very easy to store. Inexpensive,so if I loose them it's not a big deal.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|the only thing is the ads are kind of annoying (hey, it's an ad.) but other than that it's a calculator....no other problems.
1454901276|5.0|Good mystery against the background of the Outer Hebrides.  Characters well developed and believable.  Good exposition of local customs and environment.
034580404X|5.0|My wife loves these books. They made it to the house in no time at all, they are in perfect condition. My wife has already read the first book and half of the second... She reads while eating dinner ! When the wife is happy Im happy... Great product and great seller.Thanks Amazon and  E L James !!!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this clock app. It's easy to use, the interface isn't overly complicated and the alarm tone selection is really good.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is such a fabulous musician ...nice to capture the moment on cd as the show was excellent. I liked the cross over styles of blues/country as well.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|If you like your heroes to be the smartest guy in every room, to be virtually indestructible, and have the stamina of the Energizer bunny, then this is the book for you. If you like fast action on every page and plot twists that nobody could predict, then this is the book for you. If you don't mind that all the characters (yes even the hero) are as flat as a pancake then you'll have no trouble with this book. Personally, I need a good no-brainer every once in awhile and The Innocent  was perfect. A load of fun - but certainly not literature.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|i watched this whole season in one night. because i soon realized i could fast forward through the dialogue and miss nearly nothing except being annoyed be tedious, repetitive dialogue.<br /><br />nearly every single exchange can be summed up as some variation of, let's us two walk a little away from the group so i can say,<br /><br />\\"i can't bear any longer this depressing, horrific reality!\\"<br />\\" you need to keep fighting! for the group! for the children! for the future!\\"<br /><br />aaaand repeat this several times, slightly rephrased each time, while melodramatically emoting...then wander back to the group. and usually while people are distracted by inane dialogue like this, a kid or someone wanders away and stumbles into a zombie, even though by this time, anyone who isn't on their guard against zombies deserves to stupidly die, so we just laugh.<br /><br />one exchange that had me groaning was when the blonde chick wanted her gun, but the white beard dude wouldn't give it to her. this was when i realized that the dialogue was inane, plodding, irritating repetition. she says,<br />\\"i want my gun.\\"<br />\\"i don't think that's a good idea.\\"<br />\\"it's my choice if i want to die.\\"<br />\\"but i feel like you shouldn't.\\"<br />\\"but it's my choice if i want to.\\"<br />\\"but i feel like you shouldn't.\\"<br />\\"but it's my choice if i want to.\\"<br />\\"but i feel like you shouldn't.\\"<br />\\"but it's my choice if i want to.\\"<br />\\"but i feel like you shouldn't.\\" \\"<br />\\"but it's my choice if i want to.\\"<br />\\"but i feel like you shouldn't\\"<br /><br />aaaaand scene! of course this dialogue is phrased slightly differently each time, and spoken in varying tones of softness and loudness, but that is essentially the extent to which it moves the plot forward.<br /><br />then there's the episode where the precious kid of whom his parents are supposedly devotedly protective, spends the entire episode wandering alone and all over the place...unprotected into the woods to face a zombie alone, then stumbles upon one \\"private\\" grown-up moment after another, without any organized system of watching or protecting him. this defies belief.<br /><br />then....SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />when the white beard dude finally buys it, it's because, of course, he has wandered off into the dark field alone, and when he finds a mutilated cow, he doesn't look around for danger, he just stares at it dumbly, then of course, despite the fact that he is out in an open field alone, and has been alerted to something violent having happened, the zombie nevertheless is able to just step in from off camera (if someone is off camera, then of course the person who is on camera cannot see hear or sense their presence until they leap noisily into view of the camera. then having been so unbelievably stupid, even after all the time they've had to get used to zombie attacks, we don't feel a thing for the idiot who has just stupidly caused his own death.<br /><br />those are just 2 of the most memorably stupid moments in season 2.<br /><br />however, when the action directors take over, and a big zombie attack is underway, and there's no time for annoyingly stupid dialogue, this show really shines.<br /><br />and there were also 2 good memorable plot moments..... SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />when we think the fat guy sacrificed himself - but then it's revealed that he was actually killed by the other guy - that was actually a cool twist.<br /><br />and when the two strangers came into the bar and there was a classic western-type showdown with the tension building as you realize that these 2 starngers are the opposite of friendly even as the act polite...there's 2 good moments. but unlike the 2 lame moments i described, there arent lots more like that....there's just lots and lots of the annoying repetition of....<br /><br />\\"i can't bear any longer this depressing and horrific reality\\"<br />\\"you need to keep fighting! for the group! for the children! for the future!\\"<br /><br />also the old predictable standby of,<br /><br />\\"let me tell you a fond nostalgic story\\".<br /><br />laaame.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|using this on a Kindle Fire 1st gen, one of the recent updates causes some process to crash constantly, though the main app still functions. some spreadsheets once saved by this app become unusable by excel, even though it is in excel format. the remote storage options are a great idea, but rarely work correctly. for the price, they need to work out some issues.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of those books that really pull you in and cause you to become so engulfed in the story that you laugh, cry and get mad right along with the characters in the book. I could not put this down and I was totally obsessed with reading it. I have it a full 5 stars, this is the second book i've read from Author, Colleen Hoover, the first was &#34;Slammed&#34; which was also a good read. I love this author!!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I read this book many yrs ago when it first came out and no one had heard of the author.  It was really a good read then, and it's as good this 2nd time around!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Excellent story and intrigue! What is going to happen next is anybody's guess! Since I have to wait a year for book 6, I think I will read book 5 again!
B004GJYRA0|2.0|I didn't care for the idea behind the movie.  Too liberal.  The acting was also poor.  I didn't care for the plot.

B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I bought this cable for my travel bag so I would always have it when I went out of town. I was going through my bag today and found that the white outer layer of the cord is crumbling into small pieces, the full length of the cable. The cord may work fine without the white layer leaving the silver layer, I will try it at home. But what a mess. I received it in Dec. 2012. I have been using Kindles' since #2, and this is the first problem I have had with any Kindle, Kindle product, or their many accessories I have purchased. Too bad I really like the clean crisp look of the white, but I hate that the cord turned out to be so crisp that it crumbles.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|What a great album to listen to! So glad I bought this CD as it was well worth my money.
0670024813|5.0|Some years ago there was much speculation about the respective contributions of nature and nurture to humans' thoughts and behavior. I remember such questions as what would happen if we dressed baby girls in blue and boys in pink and gave the boys dolls to play with--would the boys grow up behaving like girls are supposed to and vice versa? That set me to toying with ideas for a book about what Diamond calls \\"the world until yesterday\\" to provide at least a partial answer. His book, even with its quite different emphasis, incidentally provides more insight into what is natural to our species than anything I might have written.<br />There was a time when Europeans used to speak of hunter-gatherers or small-scale farmers such as Diamond describes as \\"naturals\\". They were seen as living in the state of nature--their behavior being a direct expression of their natures, whereas that of civilized people was the result of deliberate design. Its very unnaturalness--rising above our animal natures--was considered a virtue.<br />Of course, no human societies live in an actual state of nature--every society has adapted to its own conditions through its own culture and no one's behavior is simply instinctual. Nevertheless, there were extensive similarities in the conditions to which all hunter-gatherers had to adapt and in the resulting behaviors and the cultures built around them. And hunter-gatherer conditions persisted for many thousands of years--a period during which the biological (and psychological) adaptations that define our species occurred.<br />What we're left with today are the kinds of peoples that Diamond describes--the few hunter-gatherers who have survived in the margins of today's world supplemented by the more numerous small-scale agriculturalists. The cultures of the latter are still broadly comparable.<br />And so the kinds of behaviors described as representing \\"the world until yesterday\\" come as close as any we're going to find to those that are natural for our species--those for which we are adapted.<br />All of the additional complexities that we know today are attributable to food surplus--to individuals being able to reliably produce more than enough food to feed themselves. This meant that there were no periods of starvation (at least for key segments of the population). It also meant that not everyone had to spend their time in food production--some were thus freed to pursue other activities.<br />A very conspicuous difference between yesterday's world and our modern states is the concentration of power in the hands of an authority with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Such an authority with police powers capable of imposing peace within the society was, of course, impossible until there was a sufficient surplus to feed those who would impose the peace.<br />The absence of peace as we know it was an aspect of yesterday's world that always struck me as particularly disturbing. At some level people must never have been free of an awareness of potential dangers that we no longer face. And of course this was the inevitable state of affairs until there was concentration of power in the hands of a government with police powers capable of imposing peace within the society.<br />One could hardly say that the attitudes and behaviors that were natural yesterday have left no traces in today's world. First of all, on the international level there is no authority capable of maintaining peace between nations, and although negotiation can play a complicating role, in the end the relations between nations continue to follow very much the old pattern.<br />Something else that has seemed to me to reflect the same aspect of our nature is the street gangs, especially in some areas in big American cities with limited police control. These gangs are engaged in a constant battle to gain and maintain respect for their ability to defend themselves and retaliate for any offense against them.<br />Another institution of modernsociety that seems to have its antecedent in yesterday's state of constant (active or latent) war is sports. It's easy to see sports as reflecting a sense of groups in a continuing contest for survival.<br />Maybe this seemed clearest to me in the conditions where I grew up. That was in an area with towns small enough that, typically, each town had a single high school, and there was a lot of town pride associated with their athletic teams. This was especially true of the football teams. Football being seen as the most \\"physical\\" (=manly) of the sports made those teams and their players particularly appropriate to be seen as the town's champions.<br />I do have to admit that other sports seem to play this role less well. What about women's and the less physical men's sports? And what about even football teams above the high school level? Certainly, teams that don't rely on players from the communities they represent but recruit from anywhere in the world would seem to have a more tenuous claim to community pride.<br />But in any case the avidity of the interest in sports seems to cry out for explanation: I would suggest that its antecedent is yesterday's warfare.<br />It's not surprising if we moderns pride ourselves on our invention of law and the police powers that support it. It might be tempting to attribute this achievement to some moral superiority on our part, but of course this achievement is to be found only in societies with a food supply sufficient to feed individuals to constitute and run a government.<br />Of course, a reliable food supply provides enormous advantages of many kinds. Moderns are likely to feel revulsion at Diamond's descriptions of infanticide and the abandonment of elders when resources were insufficient to maintain any who couldn't maintain themselves. And of course moderns may be particularly inclined to evaluate these practices in terms of morality, but it's important to remember that the effective exercise of morality presupposes adequate resources.<br />Further examples of the difference a reliable food supply can make appear in Diamond's descriptions of infanticide and the abandonment of elders when resources were insufficient to maintain any who couldn't maintain themselves. Of course moderns may be particularly inclined to evaluate these practices in terms of morality, but it's important to remember that the effective exercise of morality presupposes adequate resources.<br />His discussion of child-rearing practices is enlightening. One very general observation is that small children are permitted to experiment much more in ways that expose them to risks--such as handling sharp knives or approaching fires--than in our more protective approach.<br />Some particularly interesting observations came from children of Western missionaries who lived for some years in New Guinea societies before being thrust into schools in Australia or the US. The most difficult adjustment, they report, was that from a previous emphasis on cooperation and sharing behavior, they were now expected to be competitive.<br />Diamond takes on the challenge of religion. Religion is of particular interest partly because it, along with art and language, are institutions without apparent antecedents. They are universal in human societies but nothing in the other closely related species suggests their origin. Diamond doesn't look for antecedents for religion, but he does propose an explanation. He sees religion as having evolved along with human culture. During our cultural evolution he sees religion as having performed a total of seven different functions as it evolved with those that were most important at some stages being less so or even absent at others. I find this a quite plausible scenario.<br />He also takes on language, though not its origins. He argues for the preservation of languages and the advantages (including psychological) of knowing more than one language. I would agree with what he says, but to my mind there is a more important reason for individual multilingualism and for preserving as many languages as possible.<br />I'm convinced that there are subtle differences in reality as different languages represent it to us. However, we have never found a satisfactory way of talking about these differences. In fact, it seems to me that people are very chary of even broaching the subject. And I think much of the blame for that can be attributed to the myth of a \\"Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\\".<br />This myth was invented in the early 1950s or thereabouts by the linguistic establishment of the time who were concerned that the surge of interest in the writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf was likely to divert funding away from what was then the dominant line of research. They effectively attacked the threat by representing it as a quite extravagant hypothesis that was much too vague to be tested and thus left nothing further that could be done. The implication was that there were either profound ontological differences between languages or none at all. This ploy continues to this day to be a harmful constraint on linguistic discourse.<br />Anyway, I feel that there are subtle differences in the emphases and interconnectedness that different languages give to reality, and that the sum of all of these adds up to an accumulated understanding, an accumulated wisdom, a sort of intellectual patrimony of our species. But this matter still awaits its Darwin or Newton.<br />Of course, many more subjects are covered in this quite impressive book. Diamond is uniquely equipped to write such a book, his extensive experience with a great variety of New Guinea societies is a rare asset.  This is well up to the high standard he has set in previous works.
B00AEK9BKQ|2.0|Based on the title, I expected more from the move; I was disappointed; slow and sad movie, would not recommend!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This story started a little confusing in audio, so I switched to my kindle and read it. It starts in 2005, skips back to 2003, then 2001, then present of 2008.<br />The whole book skips back and forth from present to past, thus explaining the whole story.<br />Catherine, our heroine has OCD disorder, that gradually gets explained, through her relationship with psychotic Lee. The story of their relationship is a scary one, and also very believeable, in the way Lee manipulates people connected to Catherine.<br />She tries to rebuild her life, the only way she can, but who can she trust. In this story, that is the biggest question, because you don't know if she can trust anyone, even her new boyfriend.<br />It's a page turning thriller, that is hard to put down.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I think that the guys in fall out boy have really struck a nice balance of contemporary style with enough of their old (see take this to your grave) edge. Patrick's got such a unique voice and Pete's lyrics are absolutely cutting, really brilliant. Its worth your money.

Only problem i had was with the box itself, the Blue-ray tab that was sticky glued to the box itself is coming off but other then that no problems. Only thing they could have made better was the disk holders, if u watch them a lot and are sliding them in and out of there so much the disks are going to get scratched over time.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book really tugged at my heart. I recommend this book to people who can really imagine things they read
0062059963|5.0|My love for these books is pretty ridiculous. I just get so sucked into the world Kiera Cass builds in The Selection and The Elite. I love the drama and the competition and the characters.<br /><br />I even love the characters when I hate the characters. You guys, everyone kind of sucks in The Elite - they make terrible decisions and same dumb things BUT IT'S OKAY. Because even when I was practically shaking my book in WHAT THE HECK MAXONness, I was also like \\"Oh, this is just so good.\\"<br /><br />I just love the story of The Elite. I'm a sucker for dystopianish stories and I'm a sucker for reality shows - there's nothing about The Elite that doesn't appeal to me. I had some issues with The Selection where I felt like there was a lot of telling vs showing (I know, it's annoying that I just said that, but it's true), but I didn't get tripped up on anything like that in The Elite.<br /><br />I'm still Team Maxon. I love the idea of Aspen - and probably in any other case, I would be Team Aspen all the way because I'm always either Team Original Guy (aka Aspen) or Team That One Guy Who Doesn't Have a Chance, but for whatever reason, it's Maxon all the way for me. And I could still be Team That One Guy Who Doesn't Have a Chance - I genuinely don't know where it's going to go!<br /><br />Either way, I'm beyond stoked for book three. If you're looking for a fun and engaging dystopian series, I definitely recommend picking this up! And if you enjoyed The Selection, be sure to pick up The Elite by Kiera Cass!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book was a great little read even if it dealt with some dark topics. I understand it takes place in Ireland but the authentic Irish dialect made for difficult reading transitions.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton is my new favorite author. The way the story moved from the present to the past and back again was seamless .

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Neil Patrick Harris' Dr. Horrible aspires to be a super villain--and only the recognition by a sort of super villain hall of fame can provide him with the validation that he yearns for.  His professional aspirations, however, fall prey to both the interference of his pompous nemesis Captain Hammer and the doctor's attraction to the sweet and pretty girl-humanitarian he meets at the laundromat.  An additional problem is the Dr. Horrible is not really that horrible--and thereby lacks much of the killer instinct that would make him an A-1 bad guy.  Things, nevertheless, end up working out--and in a way that is darkly (but charmingly) comedic as well as ridiculously horrible!

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|a big thank you to amazon. this movie still hasn't come out on dvd here in australia, but thanks to amazon, i've enjoyed it many times already.<br />I read the hobbit a few years ago. i know that there are quite a few inconsistencies in the movie, but i still loved it. i get irritated knowing i have to wait so long for the other two movies... but once they come out i'm sure i'll be happy that i have more movies to love. i think peter jackson has done a great job. love the music. love the scenery. happy with the cast. martin freeman was perfect for bilbo. was fun to see some lord of the rings characters again-- in the movie and the extras.<br />at first i thought i got ripped off with the bonus dvd-- because on the extras there wasn't many choices. but the blogs were great and lasted a lot longer than i thought. would have liked to see more on the making of, but i'm sure they'll bring something out later.<br />loved lord of the rings and love the hobbit. can't wait for the other two movies to come out!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I read the follow up book first, so I had to find out what they were referring to by reading this one. I'm glad I did. This one is just as compelling as the sequel. I really enjoyed this one. It kept you wanting more at the end of each chapter. I highly recommend this one to anyone who likes mysteries.

Yeah that's what I thought also but not going to happen the game play is slow and the music is quite annoying I also find myself wishing I hadn't downloaded it. The controls on this game are ridiculously uncomfortable. So it gets 2 out of 5 stars from me because it was a good idea just poorly executed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good basic graphics<br />You can turn off the music in settings<br /><br />Cons:<br />Game play is annoying and harder then it should be.<br />Multi-player version is slow and hard to play as you have players on both sides of match and fingers get interlocked.<br />Music is pretty bad<br /><br />What do you know another amazon download of the day that's a waste of memory. Don't waste your time with this game I really don't get how anyone thinks this app is worth paying for. And now I delete it from my kindle
B005VPSEK2|5.0|I really like the songs.  way more good songs on here than I knew about.  If I had known it would have been so good i would have bought it sooner.
0060581808|3.0|This first installment of the acclaimed LITTLE HOUSE series chronicles the life of a frontier girl named Laura Ingalls.  Pa, Ma, and their three daughters have moved to the Big Woods of Wisconsin, where there are few white settlers; she dismisses by omission any reference to the Native Americans already living there also. Very talented and hard working Pa plays fiddle, sings, and calls square dances when he is not hard at work, hunting, plowing, making furniture and providing steady moral guidance. Ma works tirelessly to perform the myriad household tasks expected of frontier women: baking, sewing, preserving, making butter, cheese, soap--even to braiding straw hats. With so much work to do just to survive obviously the girls are required to help.<br /><br /> There is little actual plot (storyline, dramatic conflict) in this book because Laura at five doesn't get into too much trouble. The book relates general frontier life over one year--in gradual seasonal progression.  Most of the narrative proves to be detailed  exposition of how things are made and how tasks are performed. Thus this book, with its wonderful illustrations by Garth Williams, proves an invaluable source of information--clearly stated so that children can understand and appreciate how hard life was for children in the old days.<br /><br />  Yet life was not all grim as both adults and children found time to relax, socialize and even play.  It was of critical importance to live within driving distance of a town, and to have neighbors and even family members within walking distance. At age 5 Laura was observant as well as spunky, but she was sadly jealous of her older sister Mary, with her ladylike ways and golden curls--admired by so many. She learns hard lessons in behavior and self control from her wise but fair Pa, whom she adores.  There are incidents of unexpected bravery too, as the family has many encounters with bears and other wild animals. This charming book presents accurate information about the challenges of living in the wild, but also reminds us of the importance of family values. Even in the cold of winter one can feel the warmth of the Ingalls' hearth--a treasure which has been handed down to several generations of young readers.bout the challenges of living in the wild, but also reminds us of the importance of family values.

1402736924|3.0|Newly orphaned, eleven-year-old Pollyanna is sent to live with a stern relative in a distant town.  Aunt Polly forbids her even to mention her dead father's name, treating her like an unwanted, poor relation--which is precisely what she is. At least Nancy, the kindly housekeeper, treats the lonely child with compassion. But Pollyanna had learned from her father the trick of making lemonade out of life's lemons; she tries to be cheerful despite drawbacks and interactions with mean or sour adults. Without realizing it the little girl offers hope and cheer to others in town--in her charming, unsophisticated manner. Soon the Glad Game is being played by her neighbors--adults as well as children, for light and natural joy bubble out of her unspoiled breast.<br /><br /> Then Tragedy strikes: Pollyanna is struck by an automobile and becomes crippled. The town rallies to her support and even stern Aunt Polly---still harboring some secret grudge from the past--unbends enough to prove more human than previously demonstrated. The 1913 style, when radios were newly in fashion, is quaint by today's standards, but the spirit of optimism, although nearly overdone, provides a valuable lesson. We cannot control what happens to us--only how we react to those changes. Thus this sentimental story offers gentle moral guidance without being preachy. Truly an American classic for kids of all ages.

B000EGDC0A|5.0|Starting with &#34;Ooh La La&#34; and continuing with &#34;Lovely 2 C U&#34; and &#34;Ride a White Horse&#34;, this is almost a greatest hits album for Alison. The hits continue til the end, and it includes &#34;Beautiful&#34; as a bonus. Having only recently discovered Alison and her band, I don't have a long history with them...fresh ears and an open mind are what I offered. In return, they offer an album that features sensuous electronica and the most sensual lead singer going today, after the passing of Chrissy Amphlett of Divinyls. This is a sophisticated sexy sound, very in tune with European tastes, but it appeals to my European soul. Sample it, and if you don't like at least a couple tracks, it's not your taste. But I love the taste, and I play my copy regularly, especially the autoripped mp3s, which I greatly appreciate. Two thumbs up.

It also is a nice-looking piece that is an excellent value.<br /><br />The only things not perfect with this Seiko are:<br /><br />1. the design wastes a whole small dial (upper right) to tell me if it's am or pm (the 12/24 hour indicator); wish it counted hours;<br />2. in a related issue, the stop watch function is limited to one-hour maximum (the stop watch just stops when the hand on the small bottom dial, which counts minutes, hits 60 minutes).<br />3. as others have noted, the 20 mm strap width is a bit narrow to stabilize the heavy watch; replacing the original with a 22 mm NATO band helps a little bit;<br />4. the rotating bezel is too easy to move;<br />5. the minute markers do not line up exactly with the minute hand on the lower half of the face (when the sweeping seconds-counting hand hits \\"60\\" on the small dial on the upper left).<br /><br />The lume is okay, much better than other non-tritium watches, but nothing like a Luminox (I am reluctant to buy the newer Luminox models after the original SEAL models - see my other reviews on the Ultimate SEAL and Pointman Recon).<br /><br />A plus is that the bezel and crystal are scratch-resistant thus far.

B006DGHYJK|5.0|This is an excellent movie and the Redux in Blu-Ray with surround sound is even better. I am quite pleased with my purchase.
B001H1SVO8|1.0|I heard a lot of people talk this movie up.  So I thought that I would try it.  IT TOTALY SUCKED IN MY OPINION. Dumb
1451695195|1.0|This book is anecdotal bunk and the reason I canceled my subscription to Newsweek, which used this book to make a claim on its cover that heaven existed. It's not science. It's one man's opinion, one man's experience as if we humans know all there is about the human brain and the storage of information in the body itself and that his experience is fact..is science. It is not science. I have seen this book debunked by physicians with similar credentials as his. The human brain has had at least 250,000 years to prepare for death. It's not something the human wants to do. So we invent the soul, we invent heaven, and religion etc etc.  We now know that the subsconscious consumes 75% of the brain's energy. We know it can do strange things that we cannot control. For example, following a double hernia operation, every time I saw someone fall  on TV or in a movie, or in real life,  my knees would hurt...for an instant. It still happens 3O years after the operation. Can't stop it.  That's my anecdote.  We have had less than 100 years to really begin to understand the brain. Not a helluvah lot of time considering how long we're been around.  We think all memory resides in the brain. I'm not so sure. We have some information in every strand of DNA. People who have had half their brains removed saw the remaining half take over the functions of the removed brain. Perhaps the doctors brain was wired a bit differently...perhaps he has a real need to live on. Perhaps he's too arrogant to even think he might die...so his brain conjures up this crazy dream..and he writes a book!? All these comments are reasonable. I am no doctor. I also know that too many doctors make too many mistakes. They are just like you and me. Humans. Frail. Not gods. This book will make the doctor a fortune...at your expense. Do read it. Go ahead...but it proves nothing...no matter how much you want ot believe his story it's still not science.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love the way they tie in all of these different characters.  I love anything fantasy!  This is a show that really grabs my attention.
B008PUF3VS|4.0|My students are excited to finish the book so they can see the movie. I have it on my Kindle but allow the kids to read it from the projector. Goes great with the audio book.
B0000046W9|5.0|I was in Nashville when I first came across this collection where I'd become afraid of turning on my radio for fear of hearing yet again another trailor-park view of life.  Stan Getz brought cool bossa nova into my life, and I survived with less pick-up trucks, not that there's anything wrong with that.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|bbc  got it right, this is so good hope they keep making this show. just wish it would be even longer episodes
B00AO686MY|3.0|Silly and inane on this level doesn't entertain as much these days for me.  The side story about the elimination of public transportation in L. A., a tragedy on so many levels, needed more emphasis, I thought.

1451696191|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I enjoyed the format very much.  I could relate to the main character.  It was a quick read.  It was both fun and at times heavy.  I am looking forward to watching the movie as I have heard it follows the book closely.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|Lean In is well written, humorous and truthful. It is thought-provoking and provides a good starting point for group discussion.
0062127241|1.0|This is the almost worst rock bio I've read. Admittedly, I've only read a few. George Harrison's bio \\"I Me, Me, Mine\\" was brief and similarly uninsightful, but this one is also pathetic and written from the perspective of the arrested juvenile development that apparently Townsend never grew out of. He seems intimidated by stars who perhaps weren't better musicians (The Stones), deluded that readers care about pages of boyhood pictures, but most tellingly, never seems to collect any of the incidents of the band into a coherent, meaningful process. It's all a scattered collection of Post-It notes. Townsend is the opposite of a \\"word man\\", he doesn't write well, doesn't have a command of the language, and leans on half-baked semi-cliches ... picking from a random page here ... \\"their respective doors were open\\"?  ... \\"the park stretched like a green lake\\"? ... \\"As I started to fall between heaven and hell\\"? ... \\"As the ghosts in my dreams came to life I was being beaten by two Mafia-style thugs\\"?  The back cover is adorned with an inspirational moment apparently Townsend takes pride in: Smashing a guitar on stage. Too bad he didn't consider that his great PR accomplishment was at the expense of local music stores. He stole the guitars. Making hay of smashing up other people's property. Now that's art. Not.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|What I like:<br /><br />The finish of this watch is really nice, the things that hold the strap are made from metal and this is awesome because on traditional watches of plastic or lether this piece is the first to fall off at least in my experience.<br /><br />Things I dislike:<br />I only bought one, should have order at least one of each color.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is way more fun then I expected border line addictive, great art work on the cards and challenging opponent's. Join us and have some fun.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|(WARNING! Plot Point & Last Quarter SPOILERS Ahead!) My two cents?  Absolutely brilliant, thrilling, disturbing, exhilarating, hilarious, violent, expansive, and beautiful......until after the Candy Land massacre.  A muddled last quarter finale not helped by Mr. Tarentino's lame vanity acting. Most of what came before was actually believable and exciting, but after losing two of the main characters it seems Quentin was at a loss at how to end it.  Although Jamie Foxx was excellent, contrary to some reviewers, Leonard DiCaprio and ESPECIALLY Christoph Waltz were so dynamic that their loss sucked the life out of what happened afterwards.  Worth seeing and worth owning but more of a three and a half star film raised to four by DiCaprio and ESPECIALLY Waltz.  That's my two cents......<br /><br />For further study: [[ASIN:B0016LFG4M Mandingo]], [[ASIN:B001GLUTD0 Buck And The Preacher]], [[ASIN:B005J7K9DM The Birth Of A Nation]], [[ASIN:B0072V394E Django]], [[ASIN:B000IZXHQQ For A Few Dollars More]], [[ASIN:B00000IXPN A Boy & His Dog]], [[ASIN:B001B2JHVE What's Eating Gilbert Grape]], [[ASIN:B006RXQ9UO Jackie Brown]], [[ASIN:B002T9H2LA Inglourious Basterds]]
B00CBKXGPI|1.0|This is a &quot;demo&quot; of the game that can be purchased in-app, and as such will let you play for about 10 minutes before cutting you off.<br /><br />What I was allowed to play I found rather boring. It might get better if I upgraded, but I'm not taking the risk. Too much roulette wheel and &quot;find the difference&quot; and too little intelligent gameplay for my taste.<br /><br />Too bad.
B000WTNCQI|5.0|This is specifically the 2007 double LP reissue on vinyl that I am reviewing here.  And my focus is on sound quality as the musical content has been thoroughly covered!<br />I love this double vinyl reissue and my expectations were surpassed for it.  Not sure who did the pressing but my copy is beautifully pressed with excellent sound.  From what I can tell reading online, this is the digitally mastered source used in the cd issue.  As a vinyl fan, I find the sound very pleasing, very clear and still very `organic' sounding.  Even if the source is digital, to my ears, vinyl provides a better soundstage than cd in this case.<br />As a double lp presentation at the normal 33 1/3 rpm. speed, the tracks are set up as follows:<br />Disc 1:<br />Side 1 - Original tracks 1-3<br />Side 2 - Original tracks 4 and 5<br />Disc 2:<br />Side 1 - Original tracks 6-8<br />Side 2 - Original tracks 9-11<br />This leaves lots of vinyl groove space for maximum sound reproduction.  I wasn't sure from the cover if it would be 33 1/3 or 45 rpm. but it is the former.  Yes, this means getting up more often to change sides but I was surprised to find this advantageous, not only in sound quality but it made me pay more attention to what I have previously considered the `lesser' tracks on this record - #6 - 11.  They are the ones that perhaps benefit most from this presentation as there are some terrific production touches that I have missed before and now standout on this crystalline vinyl sound.  Until know, I have not appreciated the left turn taken in mood with the final 2 songs `Exit' and `Mothers of the Disappeared'.  There is a ghostly atmosphere provided by the Eno/Lanois production that is revealed better than ever here.<br />Also worthy of mention, `Bullet the Blue Sky' has never this good to me.  The drums are rock solid while the Edge's guitar slithers menacingly between the speakers to capture the harrowing feel of this song like never before.<br />I got tired of the Joshua Tree after listening to it so much when it first came out, much like Rumours by Fleetwood Mac (which has also been reissued on great sounding new vinyl in 2011).  However, with the new and improved vinyl sound of this reissue, I am reconnecting with it on a new level of appreciation.<br />Anyone wanting to know if this reissue is worth it, I would emphatically say `Yes'.  I don't have an original UK pressing to compare it to so searching the audio forums may help if you want that comparison.  However, this is definitely a sonic gem for me and you will be especially in for a treat if you have only owned it on cd before.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was  a amazing book, I was impressed with the writing style and I can't wait to watch the movie! I recommend this book to ANYONE :)

B007VYDFMS|5.0|I am a Trinidadian, but being from the West Indies as a youth when I was growing up I heard alot of Bob Marley's music. I must say that his music had some influence on my especially his more \\"conscious\\" lyrics. I'm a cable technician by profession and was in a customer's home when we go to talking and he was \\"going on and on\\" about the movie. He knew much more than me. Then I saw the preview for the movie and thought that this is something definitely worth seeing. I thought I knew Bob Marley but after seeing this movie I barely knew anything. This documentary is the real deal. I enjoyed it quite a lot.<br /><br />\\"Its all good\\"

B002JVWR4U|3.0|Eliza Dushku is on the cover of these DVDs and gets the most screen time in most episodes. However, Dollhouse's greatest strength and weakness is that it's not really about Eliza Dushku or her character. Let me explain.<br /><br />The concept behind the show is brilliant. A company programs people to serve clients in whatever capacity needed, from prostitutes to criminal investigators. The show really shines when it tackles the moral and ethical questions around this. Joss Whedon is very good about never portraying the company behind the Dollhouse as \\"evil\\". The characters running the Dollhouse are flawed but realistic and even at times sympathetic, yet they are engaged in this practice of servicing people. Fortunately, most episodes show us enough of this to make the show interesting.<br /><br />As for Eliza Dushku, she is \\"Echo\\", one of the programmed \\"dolls\\" in the Dollhouse. As such, she's generally not a character who makes any important decisions or engages in the compelling ethical drama described above. Rather, pretty much every episode she is brainwashed and made to serve a new client. This is where the show sometimes gets bogged down into a \\"client of the week\\" format. While Eliza Dushku can act, her acting isn't dramatic or overwhelming enough to make every new version of her character interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, this also means she doesn't really show any character development over the course of the series - after all, she's a new person each show.<br /><br />Eliza Dushku and her character \\"Echo\\" probably take up most of the screen time in Dollhouse, which is a shame. Her story - to the extent there is one - just isn't that interesting. However, there's enough of the other material to make Dollhouse worth your while.  When watching the show, I'd recommend paying attention to what seem like the \\"background\\" characters more so than Eliza Dushku. Some of them, such as Amy Acker's \\"Dr. Saunders\\", are absolutely brilliant. In a way, to get the most out of the show, you have to shift your focus from Eliza Dushku to everybody else.<br /><br />Recommended - 3.5 stars.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I am so glad that this was recomended to me.  I could not get any thing done until i finished both seasons. I enjoyed every thing about this movie.

0440241901|4.0|Okay, I know.  As a strong, independent career-minded woman I should have found this book totally offensive and shallow.  The truth?  It's fun.  I don't go into \\"chick lit\\" books expecting Proust.  I know that the characters are one-dimensional and usually fall under the category of \\"neurotic career girl with loyal best friend that falls in love with stupidly hot and utterly unattainable guy.\\"  Emma Corrigan, our heroine in this particular foray into the modern woman, is no different.  On a plane trip from Scotland to England after a particular dismal business meeting, the plan encounters turbulence and, in fear, Emma compulsively spills all of her secrets to the handsome man sitting next to her.  She thinks she'll never see him again until she turns up at work one day and finds out, gasp!, that he's her boss.  Wackiness ensues.  It took me awhile to get into the book, but once I did, it was a good read.  I was looking for escapist literature, and that's exactly what I got.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|If you are not a political buff or really interested in freeing the slaves, you won't enjoy this one.  I honestly fell asleep after an hour, thought about watching it the next day but nah.  Not sure why it got so much hype.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Man, I have been a modern combat fan since i brought mc2 on my blackberry playbook back in 2011 loved black Pegasus, so i brought a kindle fire and brought mc4 loved it so much i brought it for my iPad along with mc3 but mc4 is comparable to console first person shooters in my book and when i hook it up to my Apple tv wireless ly it's really like a console. I know there's still some skeptics out there but buy it you will not regret it. And if it's too hard to control at first the controls are customizable.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Wonderful music but the movie is very sad.  I really think it should have remained a play.  Love the music, though.
0345803485|3.0|I first bought the trilogy not too long after they came out, but I never had a chance to read them. I have heard many praises about the trilogy, and it was apparently so good that it is being made into a movie. I read the story when it was a fanfiction, and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />However, after reading the first book right now, I'm sad to say I was not that impressed, and I'm just a bit relieved that I'm not the only one who has found the story so far, lacking. Here's what I found wrong with it:<br /><br />-First of all, the characters are way too similar to the Twilight characters. Of course, we all know that Anastasia Steele was Bella Swan, however, almost all of Bella's traits have carried over to Anastasia, making her seem like a cheap copy instead of a character unto herself. The constant blushing, lip biting, brunette, brown eyes, thinness, paleness, and clumsiness are what Isabella Swan is famous for in the fanfiction world especially. Ms. James could have given Anastasia red hair, or blonde hair. Or even black hair. Christian Grey was Edward and it too shows, with the messy copper hair and being an expert piano player. Kate Kavanaugh is obviously Rose (Rosalie) because of the personality and gorgeousness. Elliot is Emmet, with the curly hair, jokester personality, and the name. Jose is Jake, and so on and so forth. None of these characters have original qualities and traits. Even if I had not have read the story as a fanfiction first, I would have been of the same opinion that I am now.<br /><br />-The setting of Seattle is very reminiscent to the usual setting of Twilight fan fiction.<br /><br />-Some of the situations in the book were the exact same as in the Twilight universe.<br /><br />-Most of the writing was redundant/repetitive and at times somewhat juvenile, or amateurish. Ms. James should have done without the \\"Breath [name].\\" After all, that line is a famous Edward line in the Twilight/Fanfiction universe: \\"Breathe, Bella.\\"<br /><br />HOWEVER, the story does have potential. There was just enough originality to it that kept me reading. I would say a good major revision is in order. Then maybe this book would be deserving of four and five stars.<br /><br />I'm now going to read the other two books and see if anything maybe improves.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was very happy with this book. The main characters were refreshing to read about. Their constant banter and how easy it was to understand their standpoint in life. I absolutely loved that the main character was not just a girl who was absent-minded about her surroundings, or about life. She is smart, sexy, and compassionate. Her love interest is the same and keeps you wanting to read more just to know what he will say next, do next, and try next to allow their lives to un-fold together. A very funny, sexy, and relatable book. :)

Cause the truth is, honey, there's no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love, well, you haven't lived a life at all.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Very well done story, wonderful music production vy T Bone Burnett. Inspired by a book title from the film Sullivan's Travels with Joel McCrae and Veronica Lake.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I purchased this watch because I wanted a casual automatic. This Seiko was reasonably priced and the clarity of the dial and overall appearance caught my attention. It is light weight and comfortable to wear and very easy to read at a glance. I selected the super saver savings shipment, which at times can be as quick as a few days, and as long as too many. The watch showed up 3 days before the estimated arrival date, perhaps setting the stage in a positive way. The watch has a day / date display with rapid set feature. It does not have a manual wind feature, but is easily kept wound with a few minutes twice a day when not worn. Stays powered overnight and during the day with just a few hours of ware during the evening. So far this Seiko 5 keeps good time, within a few seconds a day and a minute per week. It does not have a hacking movement, but can be set to the second with slight counter clockwise pressure on the crown to stop the movement in second (time setting) position to accomplish the same result. If you are looking for a nice light, easy to read automatic at a good price, then buy this one. I purchased the green one, but it comes in other colors that I am sure are equally cool.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|A factual based fiction novel that is fun to read.  Gives refreshed view of why it's great to live in a democracy.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I read this book in two nights.  It's a very easy read and very informative.  Matthews doesn't offer anything particularly new if you're already familiar with training, however, what I found interesting about this book is Matthews' emphasis on diet and of course the compound lifts.  Also, Matthews goes against the grain a bit by recommending working in the 4-6 rep range, as opposed to the usual 8-12 rep range.  This is a good book to start with, but I'm not sure I agree with the authors training a bodypart only one time per week; he offers examples of workouts such as a 5 day training plan where you work a muscle group one time during the week, and he also shows a 3 day training plan where once again, you train a body part once a week.  This may work for some, but doesn't offer a lot of individualization and does not take into account variability in recovery between workouts, etc.<br />Not a bad book by any means, but in the end, I think the best thing is to take the information and design a program that works best for you.
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|Interesting read. I could relate with alot of the subjects, but at other times it just got wordy and a little boring. Good book overall.
B00BAVCD8A|2.0|I've been a big FOB fan for years, was excited about the new album, and even got tricked by the title into believing there would be actual rock from FOB this time around.  Alas, it wasn't to be.  I won't bore you with a breakdown of my complaints about Save Rock N Roll, but will just say this is not the Fall Out Boy I became a fan of.  (Hell, I even stuck by them after Folie a Deux).  But this is just too much evolution away from what was cool about them years ago.  I'm not saying the rest of you can't love this rock n roll version of Rihanna that FOB has become, but not I - I'm done.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, FOB should leave the Illuminati marketing s*** to Kayne West; it is so overdone and not cool anymore I can't even express it.  The Illuminati FOB pyramid was just sad.  I wonder if Kayne told them how to market themselves this time.  Guess the Jay-z pyramid hand symbols stupidity will be next.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|i was trying to open 2 different excel files and the program freezes up no matter which one i opened or how many times i restarted the app....don't waste your time or money!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I'm a biased Eastwood fan so there is little this man can star in that I would be disappointed in.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This computer bag is awesome and can hold more than it looks.  Pockets everywhere enable a lot of extras to be stuffed in the bag!
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Constant action in this film, even if the things they do aren't possible, but that's the job of Hollywood.  Sure there will be a sequel.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a no brainer game.  Totally stress free and fun.  I almost hate to turn it off when I know I haven't finished building the village.  The little people are so cute!  Sometimes I get impatient when I can't finish a level after I have taken a bit too long.  But I prevail and build another building for my little people.  This is good for all ages.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|The last 30 minutes of this film had some nice suspense but overall it's a pretty cheap rip-off of a much better movie called Spartacus. (No, not the new Spartacus but the old one Starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Stanley Kubrick.) Do yourself a favor and watch the classic version.
B007IK44CK|3.0|It was good, but not great.  I watched it because it was free to stream with Prime, not sure I would have paid money to explicitely see it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like this game.  It was so engrossing, I was able to play thru the free game in an hour. I am giving it 4 stars because even though I really like what I have seen so far, I haven't played the full version and I will rate it again then.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Got this for my daughters, they love it!  They watch it every weekend.  I would recommend it for a girls movie night.

B007ZTLLMK|3.0|This is supposed to be a simulation of flying rc helicopters but in reality at least with my older electronics it was not much help.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|doesn't really do much.... I got bored fast.  There should be more to it than just matching blocks like maybe hidden treasures...
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is amazing! I made my bf watch it and he was &#34;surprisingly entertained.&#34; I don't think you can give a glee-type movie more praise than that!
B000VHKFU2|5.0|The phrasing is very good and the quiet meditative character of the fourth movement of Mahler's ninth is well done.  Usually one gets more than a part of a movement but the rest can be obtained.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Mom asked for this for Christmas, bought it and had it sent straight to her.  She said thanks for the DVDs, so I guess it worked out alright.  I've never seen the show, no PBS for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and it was free. I like it better then the first one<br />I recommend. trying it I am sure. you will have lots of fun playing this game.
B007N8RULO|4.0|liked this one a lot but it is slow to deal and respond.  however, it doesn't force you to make extra moves but sliding things into the wrong space.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story of slavery and not just the black people.  Also the love and devotion among them all. the abuse and ignorance of the upper class
B009NYF2GQ|2.0|I really like the actual movie but was very disappointed in the quality of the case & cover as it was supposed to be a special 40th anniversary edition & if anything it looked cheap & nasty
B0017SWPXY|4.0|written form the perspective of a dog. normally I don't care for animal stories but this was very enjoyable reading.  Makes you think about how much dogs really do know.
B0031R5K68|4.0|This book is a great read, its thrilling and keeps you on edge. If you like Dan Brown this is the book to read.
0062059963|5.0|I just...<br /><br />I...<br /><br />Ugh...<br /><br />After starting The Elite late last night (yes, I checked-checked-and-rechecked the Kindle app on my iPad, waiting for the novel to download [12:27am?!?!] and finshing at work this morning (shh... who needs to  know?!), I feel a tremendous sense of relief along with an even bigger sense of anticipation (Spring 2014 for the next novel?! NO!!!!).<br /><br />To start, I feel Kiera Cass did a fantastic job of `nailing' the way many teenagers would have behaved if they were in the same situation as America: impulsive, hopeful, uncertain, unpredictable, jealous... it's all there. So the good news is: America's not perfect. In fact, if you want to experience some cringe-worthy moments, take a literary walk with America. I certainly had moments where I wanted to reach through the pages and shake her self-indulgent shoulders! Unfortunately, and as it happens all too often in reality, the protagonist, America, only has herself to blame for many of the trials she is about to face in the next novel that I am on the edge of my reading-seat waiting for. Despite the twists and turns of the predictable love triangle found within The Selection and The Elite, I believe Kiera Cass does another fantastic job of finishing this 2nd novel by giving the reader a clear understanding of what to expect on the horizon. If America finally begins to embrace her strengths and rises to the occasion of the opportunities that may  still lie ahead of her (fingers crossed!), my reader-prayers will have been answered. I feel--- and hopefully I am reading the signs correctly--- that by the last few pages of The Elite, the reader should be moving away from the question of \\"who\\" and more toward the question of \\"how\\"?  That leads me to an internal debate I am having about whether or not the original love triangle really needed to go on as long as it did, and my hope that it won't be a central focus in the next novel. For this relationship to work (and it has to work!), our two star-crossed characters won't have it easy. Delving into the dynamic of the two of them originating from vastly different castes, accepting how the society's structure came to be, surviving rebel attacks, understanding the rebels' motives (gotta cheer for rebels who are also book-lovers!), and becoming a united front for all to see... there's enough fuel there for a whole lot of emotional exploration regardless of love triangles and competition.  Ultimately, our headstrong protagonist's powerful shoulder-shrugging response to Prince Maxon at the end of the novel had me hook, line, and sinker. America has had two novels to mess around within, so now it's time for her to grow up and show us all what she's made of.<br /><br />If I were to offer any suggestions for improvement, I would start by addressing the length of The Elite. Is it \\"short\\"? No, but The Selection was longer. In my mind, if I have to wait forever (it sure felt like forever!) to read a novel within a series, I want the next novel to be equally as long or longer(!) than the previous novel. That being said, I hope Kiera Cass will make the wait worthwhile for all of us by making sure the 3rd novel is at least as long as the 1st. Along those same lines, I think Kiera Cass would be wise to continue releasing novellas that offer the perspectives of different characters regarding some of the more powerful scenes found within this novel. For instance, who doesn't want to know the details of Prince Maxon's discussion with America's dad? Or how about some opportunities to see what the King and Queen are saying to each other privately about their son and the contestants? Why was the Queen so moved to try and offer America a bit of motherly advice after Halloween? Better yet, why not a glimpse into how the maids and guards feel about the Prince and the competition? As with all good stories, there are many layers here and I am hopeful that Kiera Cass will invite her readers even further into understanding the nuances of the world she is creating for America and Maxon.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I never wanted to put this book down. The characters and their stories of survival were incredible. It read like it really happened.
1476733953|5.0|This book was more than a pleasure to read.  It was a good story in the hands of a gifted author.  I could not put it down!  He tempered the slow parts perfectly against the depth of characters and action scenes.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Divergent or Hunger Games, this book is another one you will likely in enjoy.  I'm surprised I haven't heard more about it, it was so good.  Pick it up and read it.  You won't be sorry.  If you're still not sure, download part one here on Amazon for free.  I bet you'll end up buying parts 2-5.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These three books are attention grabbing from beginning to end! So amazing! Can't believe that I did not read these books sooner!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story was so unexpected and amazing! The writing is wonderful and everything happens at the perfect moment. What a story!
0062059963|5.0|I read The Selection almost a year ago, and since then have re-read it more times then I care to admit. (Yes I am one of those people who can read a book over and over and still enjoy it every time.) Let me say that I have been anxiously awaiting The Elite and counting down the days till its release.  I was not disappointed!<br />I was drawn in right from the beginning. The book downloaded at midnight and I finished it at 4am.  I could not put the book down.  When it was over I just wanted it to keep going. It was well written with enough twists and turns to keep me interested and intrigued.<br />Usually with love triangles you always know what is going to happen, but this story is anything but predictable! I loved every minute of it. Kiera Cass writes some of the best characters; they have depth and real life qualities that everyone can relate to. (Even the prince!) I can't wait to read it again!!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I literally could not put this down! What a wonderful insight into the life and situations that teenagers and young adults go through and all through the eyes of one of them. Having two narrators was amazing because i connected with them both and never thought that would be possible.

B009RWRIZ2|5.0|The 3D version of &#34;Pina&#34; is a new kind of experience of home watching. The dance, the sound, the images: it's all perfect and working in harmony.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|It took me ages to finally decide to read “Dracula,\\" but, since that first read-through, I have not once regretted it. I've only ever regretted the years wasted in not reading it sooner. One of my favorite book \\"pairings,\\" if you will, is “Dracula\\" followed Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot.\\" Holy good. Spine tingling, thrilling, not to be missed out on.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Only 20 years old, &#34;Schindler's List&#34; is one of the most daring movies by Steven Spielberg and is so deep that can already be considered a classic.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Good Story line, not done as well as the comic book for us nastalgic baby boomers but with the computer graphics and cinematography it was better than I expected.  After seeing it at the theater I bought it for my DVD collection
B000XA5K4I|4.0|That's a good movie to entertain and laugh with a lot of dark and violent humor. Everything is so absurd, but works fine for its proposal.
B002BWP49M|5.0|This series is a must for any collector.  The story line is great the cinematography is fantastic and will enjoy for years to come even my grandkids will enjoy

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really don't know what they are talking about the game go stole from temple run and called it subway surfers other than that it is a good game
0765356139|3.0|The action scenes are excellent (per usual with this author), but it isn't enough to overcome the oddly sexless (both figuratively and more literally) romance between the books two main characters.  It never felt convincing and since major plot points relied on it being so the book felt flat.  Oh well, I might dip into the third book of the series to see how things end
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I loved this book. The story was beautiful. Though it was fairly long it was definitely worth reading. The characters keep you invested the whole way till the end.
0765365278|4.0|I typically am frustrated by fantasy books - sometimes the world doesn't make sense or the characters are irritating - but old B. Sanderson seems to be able to pull them off.  I've read one and a half of the Mistborn books and will say that he's really matured as an author.  Looking forward to the next release!
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|The book began as the story I am familiar with and I enjoyed it but then every chapter was about a new animal. Stories were decent but I would of rather it be about one event than several completely different ones.
0385491026|5.0|it is an acceptable copy for required high school reading. The library ran out of copies and this was certainly an inexpensive solution.
0307744434|5.0|As with The Princess Bride, character development is NOT the thing.<br /><br />I loved The Night Circus. I can't understand why some reviewers are grumbling about issues that are irrelevant to a perfectly good telling of a fairy tale.<br /><br />The story is nicely balanced. It certainly keeps your interest throughout. It offers unique and magical settings and concepts.<br /><br />It is a good story and it is good story telling.
B005D6O13S|5.0|I love these crocs.  I have a few different styles, but keep going back to these.  They are very comfortable and look nice and neat.
B00133KFGW|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worst, sappiest, melodramatic, illogical movies I've seen in a long time.  I mean, we're going along and its sappy and teary and all.  OK, fine.  But then we come to the part where the kid finds this old guitar in the attic or something and immediately starts playing like Kaki King.  That's where I lost it. There is just no way this is going to happen no matter how much innate talent the kid has.  Kaki King plays her unique style on a finely tuned, custom-made instrument.  Nobody is going to pick up an old guitar and immediately sound like this.  Anyone who could believe this knows absolutely nothing about music.  There is just no way.<br /><br />If you want a sappy love story with no basis in the real world, then this might be the movie for you.
0812548094|2.0|I'll admit I didn't finish reading this book. I got to a part depicting a dark, perverted ritual performed by evil witches and just gave up. As far as I read, the book consisted of tedious conversations between the romantic leads (\\"I love you because you're so smart and wonderful.\\" \\"No, you're even more wonderfuller because you see how smart I am.\\") interspersed with the obscene activities of the villains. I've read books with graphic violence or sexual content; if your characters feel authentic, gritty descriptions can help bring them to life. Goodkind's characters all appear to be cardboard cutouts, neatly categorized as despicably evil or incorruptibly good.<br /><br />Plus, most of the new concepts he introduces in this book appear to be unashamedly ripped-off from the Wheel of Time. After finding \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" a mixed bag, I've given up on this series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game. Downloaded and installed fast!! Game had an interesting story line and nice graphics. Works great on my kindle fire hd. I have never written a review before but I have found many of them helpful.
1452115567|5.0|I found Maddie and her owner on Instagram.  The pictures are not only adorable and interesting, they are sometimes Amazing! How does she do that??  My coonhound (also a rescue) is not this talented.  The whole family has all loved looking at it (and yes, anyone who visits must also look at the book!).  Best part is the connection you learn between the author and his dog...and the world around them.  I wish more people were like this.
1594204217|5.0|COOKED is Michael Pollan at the top of his game.  With his genial, humane style he takes us through four main types of cooking: roasting, braising, baking and fermenting, and introduces us to masters of each of these culinary arts.  (The portraits of the masters are wonderful--among the high points of the book.) Pollan has taken in a world of information about cooking and about food--and he's made it all fully his own.  The result is that you learn a tremendous amount from a teacher who is modest, kindly,fully informed--and terrific company.  One of the pursuits Pollan excels in as a writer is showing us the wonder that exists in what we had thought to be commonplace.  He's done it for gardens and buildings and now he's doing it for the art of cookery.  The book has an edge, though.  Taking control of cooking means pushing mass produced food out of the picture (at least a little further) and doing one of the very best things you can do for your welfare and your health.  A wonderful book: highly recommended.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|The world of Star Trek has so many stories to tell.  For years we have always looked forward.  This time we move backwards.  Interesting to see a story (done so well) about a young crew.
B001383XT8|1.0|I ordered this distortion pedal as a cheap alternative to the costly Boss foot pedals.  When it arrived and the Behringer 9 volt adaptor I also ordered wouldn't plug in all the way, rendering both items useless, I realized that you really do get what you pay for.  I'd advise everyone to save themselves a headache by steering clear of Behringer pedals and stick with the tried and true pedals made by Boss.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw the old version of the movie, I did not watch it yet, I will  update this after I did
0767836286|1.0|This film is hilarously awful. We've had 9/11, the London subway bombings, the Lisbon bombings, and just lately, the Boston Marathon bombers. Not ONE of them was a right wing conservative, but if you watch this trite piece of crap that the only kind of conservative there is. Everyone involved with this film should be embarrassed, but Hollywood libs know no shame.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Doyle's Holmes is an advocate of righteousness through problem solving, while the Elementary Holmes is obsessed first with the puzzle of who dunnit, ultimately to bring criminals to justice – a slight reversal.  Still, both treat the resolution of matters as a game.  Both have a drug problem which they think brings clarity to their observations and conclusions.  The later version of Sherlock regards his conclusions as statistical probabilities, whereas the earlier Sherlock seems more certain.  The earlier Sherlock demeans and avoids the police inspector, while the new version is willing to work more closely with the police captain.  The spirit of the superman detective remains the same, but each character is well placed within the epoch in which it exists. Doyle would probably enjoy the new version of his foundational Sherlock.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Love this show. Twists and turns abound. And, the title says it all. Kind of makes me think that this is what really happens in the world. Pessimistic I know, but food for thought.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game has replaced every single bingo game on my Kindle Fire HD.  The challenges are endless, the gameplay is nervewracking and fun and the people I have met from all over the world have been just 3 of my favorite things about this bingo game. It is bingo like no other.  The different rooms to play, the htg's, the slots- I am addicted to Bingo Blitz and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Matching type game with straight forward play. Fairly easy at first, but some levels are much harder than others. Strategy on levels with breaks is a must.
0880794968|4.0|I have another deck I think is much more beautiful, but this one is nice, and the tarot book I really love (Tarot for Life by Paul Quinn, http://www.amazon.com/Tarot-Life-Reading-Everyday-Guidance/dp/0835608794) uses this one, so it is more convenient. My other deck is bigger, more opulent, and has gilt edges, but  this one is less bulky in size and weight, so I just end up using it all the time.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|great game. if you like match 3 games you will enjoy this game. and its the right price. I'm sure to play a couple times a day. when time allows.....you lose track of time playing.  ;)
B000089RV6|5.0|This is the first album after Bon Scott's death; and followed their best album to that time, Highway to Hell.  The new lead singer, Brian Johnson, steps up admirably and the Young brothers never sounded better.  The album is filled with AC/DC's hard blues based rock at its very best.<br /><br />Brian Johnson's lyrics aren't as off the wall funny as Bon Scott's were, but there's some dark humor in this album, especially with \\"Have a Drink on Me.\\"  Overall a great album, and the first AC/DC album you should buy.
B001FOPODS|4.0|I ordered this movie with overnight delivery so I could show it at a music class I was giving at my son's elementary school the next morning. The movie is perfect for 4th graders. However, when I popped the DVD into the classroom player I was absolutely stunned at the inappropriate previews that showed up. 29 fourth graders got to see men beat each other up in a boxing ring followed by an appearance by a scantily clad woman as I fumbled to try to find the fast forward button. It is absolutely and totally inappropriate to have these kind of previews on an animated movie clearly created for young children.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When my children need help with their homework they go and take my kindle and work with it.Also I can pay the bills peacefully.They don't need to ask me what's the<br />answer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Since I am not a huge fan of mystery psychological thriller type, I thought I'd switch it up and try something different... plus almost everyone I know has read this and it came highly recommended.  I love the style of writing... the detailed play between the sections bouncing between Amy and Nick and the dance the writer does between them.  I love the setup, you think you know one thing for about 100 pages or so, then BAM! Something else happens.  That element was what kept me going and made me want to keep reading, the surprise, but also the play and dance the writer does.  I have to admit, the book just put me in a crappy mood.  Honestly.  I guess that means it did something, when writing touches you to your core and makes you question who you are and it just leaves you changed when everything is said and done.... but it definitely has sent me back to my 'happily ever after' type books.  I'd definitely recommend it on the suspense alone and the craft of writing.  She's got talent that Gillian Flynn.  I would absolutely read another book of hers simply based on her writing alone.  I don't think I'd revisit this book since I know the tosses and turns it puts the reader through... but if you're looking for a thriller suspensey type - worth every penny.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love the game, but when I had to get a new phone data didn't download from SD card had to start over
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Ok, here goes... I love this game, but I don't like to wait until the next day to get more credits. You can either buy more or wait. I'm not wasting money on a game, so I have no choice but to wait. It's very addicting and it's the last thing I do before I go to sleep. I even met a nice lady from New Zealand with whom I chat with regularly. Sometimes, the game freezes, and there's no way to get your credits back, especially if you didn't purchase them. Overall, it's a great app!
B00006JQU1|5.0|This is a great recording.  Podger brings warmth to these pieces; yet each seem to have a dark, haunting beauty.  Even though it's an album of solo violin the tracks don't sound thin at all, in fact they feel full of music.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I was skeptical at first that this was just another twist on &#34;The Client&#34;, but it was rather good and the plot kept you guessing right up to the end. Tomei is always good! Really liked it.
B00C5ZLIFO|5.0|I understand the previous reviewer's inability to connect with this recording, although I wonder why someone would buy a recording by Craig Taborn (even on ECM) and expect something else. Anyone who has listened to Chris Potter's group over the years, not to mention Craig's solo efforts, would expect the angular lines, dense harmonies, and forward thinking by this artist and his trio (Thomas Morgan & Gerald Cleaver). Regardless, this recording fully lives up to Craig's growing legacy and continues his journey on the offramp.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|A great lego builder, it was appropriately challenging, and a great set with a lot of features.  He loves it still, and enjoys playing with his Ninjago characters with the building.
B001CDLATE|5.0|NO dialogue but this film has a lot to say about the human condition.  This is the 4th in a series of films, all of which are simply incredible.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I was very happy when I received my cover within 48 hours...I had expected a longer wait time. It makes ready and watching videos easy and very comfortable.
B000002KKD|5.0|This album really shouldn't work.  Kate Wilson and Cindy Wilson don't sing well at this point in their career (Fred Schneider still can't or at least doesn't.)  The instruments sound cheap and campy.  Yet somehow everything fits together.  The hook driven, danceable songs all fit together with all their weird elements and it's hard to imagine the songs being done any other way.  The album sounds like a fun, non-stop party.
B003NHRIUW|4.0|I gave it four stars and not five ONLY because I purchased the Two disc blu-ray/dvd combo but only received the blu-ray disc. Not a big deal but I paid for both and expected them both in the package.
B00BD62X14|5.0|Saw this album on CBS Sunday morning, liked the sound of her voice so bought it.  I'm so glad I did!  I love to listen to this at work, on the weekends, anytime - her voice conveys love, laughter, a lovely flirtatious wickednes, pure fun!  Count me a fan!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|great game! yugi-oh meets magic the gathering. lots of fun, deck possibilities.,  and good race and class choices . cards are great and game play easy to learn
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|My son has been an avid lego builder most of his life.  He enjoys a challenge and this was a tasty little morsel to build.  Its April 4 months after Christmas and we still enjoy viewing it on our breakfast table.  Our family has history with the Shuttle program and we acknowledged the 32nd anniversary of the launch of STS-1 on 12 April.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This was my first book by Susan Kiernan-Lewis and I wasn't really impressed. It was a slow read and it didn't keep me interested. I will most likely not read another.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|The mortal instruments series has definitely captured my imagination. I wish that I could live in this world, if even for just a month or two.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I'm done. I'm 100% done. This was just so good and I can't even handle it. Thank you, John Green.

0316743003|5.0|if you are an aviation enthusiast, very detailed account of Lockheed's \\"Skunk Works\\" during the cold war. Ben Rich does an excellent job describing what a CEO goes through dealing with labor unions, the federal government and suppliers to make these amazing aircraft.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun! Easy to play. Really like the tap feature. Would recommend this app for anyone who likes a good game of spider.
1451695195|3.0|I haven't read a life after death book in many years. Because this was a neurosurgeon, I guess my expectations were too high. This was sort of vague like all the other life after death books I have read. A little boring and long-winded as well. I hope his experience is real, but I wasn't impressed with this book.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I was very happy when I received this product, and happy for the fast service.<br />I looked for this pluggable USB in many stores like, Fry's electronics, Best Buy etc. and I found it but the prices were really high. As soon as I got it I plugged all my cables to my computerized telescope and now I'm having a great time with the space! Thank you. I highly recommend this product and the seller, I got my product in great conditions.
B000W1V44I|5.0|Huge BSB fan. collect all their cds. definitely worth buying if you are the ultimate BSB fan! love these guys!<br /><br />Although I was a tiny bit disappointed because Kevin is no longer with the group, these guys still sound awesome! This cd is full of dance songs and melodies that make your heart melt!<br />Love the song &#34;Unmistakeable&#34;!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Excellant movie! Fell asleep at first but upon waking up Oh my goodness. The movie was fantastic made you think!

0142407542|5.0|The grandson for whom it was intended, turning 7 years old, absolutely loved &#34;The Gruffalo Book&#34; and &#34;The Gruffalo's Child&#34;.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If your a fan of truly original stories than this is the one for you. My jaw dropped repeatedly during this read. It is one of my favorite books of the past 2 years.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. I getvso involved. I look up and have been playing for hours trying to top my score and time. The graphics are clean and vivid. I love it.
B003954I9C|5.0|When I bought this album, I was a bit optimistic about it. I am a HUGE BSB fan, but I wasn't sure how this would turn out. After listening to this album, I was definitely glad I bought it! It was awesome! Love AJ's voice. so many good songs. Bit of a departure from BSB, but not a bad thing!
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Didn't see it yet. Kids were to loud and wasn't able to see it must rent it when by my self
034580404X|4.0|It was very different but interesting.  I could hardly put the book down because it was so intense.  Keep up the good work.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Good game alittle variety to birds. My granddaughter says. 'lets play birds papa '.just like the other games alittle different.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the writing in this book, the metaphors, similes and characters were beautifully written and in new ways. The way it was written including the voice of the narrator is fresh and interesting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I recommend The Hunger Games trilogy 100000%. The books are so captivating that you can't stop reading! I haven't felt this way about a certain series since Harry Potter. I'm obsessed now and I can't wait until catching fire comes out in theater's!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun, free &amp; hard to put down.  so addicting.  some instructions are not as clear as they can be.  I just kind go with the game.
B004IDG97S|3.0|Good movie! Wanted my daughter to see the original she showed no interest. Didn't know what to expect when I first purchased but was very please and didnt want the movie to end.
1452115567|5.0|Such a delightful book! Very creative and brings a smile to my face each time I pick it up:) Great book to have set out for guests/friends to browse through.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|you have to get this game. I love Pps and this game is perfect. me and my little sis challenge each other by seeing who can collect the most pets. super fun! get it. its free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I rate this a 5 star book because i love reading and I love it! I like action so I choose this book
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A perfect movie for watching in 3D!  Great colorful movie for the family to watch.  Rich detail and good storyline.
B002Q4TKAY|4.0|but this album has some super good songs on it and though I wouldn't call myself a &#34;victim&#34; I am a fan.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Wanted to see in 48FPS but this was the only time I had to see it. Good movie a little long but they had a story-to develop.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive I have it on all my devices. It's fun racking up your score to win against friends.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Fast, slick, perfect condition, works fantastically, sexy, love it, could not have asked for or gotten anything better than this.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Jimi Hendrix<br /><br />People, Hell and Angels<br /><br />Jimi has been dead longer than he lived so it's no surprise that the material here is familiar.  Still, Jimi's playing is always a treat and, considering that a few cuts here are variation of out of print albums, it is worthwhile to get this CD.  There are no great revelations here, but still a very entertaining experience.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|All I can say is this is an outstanding game. I have enjoyed this so much. When is the next one coming out? Such a mind stimulating game. The best game in a long time. Bravo well done!!!! I look forward to everything you produce. This is a must have game.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|no problems buying used products, everything about this purchase was just great. I highly recommend buying like this to all my friends.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this app is perfect but needs more customisation. besides that it is perfect. I would recommend this solitaire app over any of the others in the amazon app store.
B0099116AY|4.0|Hope Springs was well written.  I enjoyed the movie very much.  It made you think about the relationships in your life.
B009X01C64|1.0|The case I received doesn't fit the Kindle Fire 8.9 I paid for and received.<br />It's too small!! Good quality, but I lost my money on this one.<br />Was I sent the wrong case?<br />James
B00AYHK7RU|5.0|David Bowie<br /><br />The Next Day<br /><br />This is an excellent `comeback' album.  Every song here is solid, entertaining, and begs for repeated playing.  It does have the feeling of revisiting the themes and style of the Heroes album, but certainly in the guise of decades on maturity.  This is a great album and belongs beside his classic releases. Welcome back!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00001OH7V Heroes]]
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I read all the books and they have been doing a wonderful job over at HBO producing a great representation of the series... loving Season 3 so far as well!
B008220D5K|1.0|First off, while I like Paul Rudd, I do not always like his movies. Judd Apatow is horrible and I keep wondering why people find him funny. But Knocked Up wasn't half bad and I liked the Paul Rudd character so I thought I'd give this one a shot. Also as a 40 year old father I thought I might be able to relate. One other thing, in the preview, there is this funny scene where Rudd is dancing in his underwear with a funny voice while his daughter is Skyping to embarrass her and I definitely wanted to see the rest of that bit, but guess what, NOT IN THE MOVIE (maybe in the unrated version, but I would not want to sit through this thing again to find out). Assuming that companies release trailers that show \\"teaser\\" funny spots to lure you in to the movie and then cut that part from the movie seems like bait and switch to me, but I digress. Okay first of all, I have tolerance for language and have unintentionally cursed in front of my kids to some degree, but when did f$#% become every part of acceptable speech. I feel like I am watching more Eddie Murphy Raw than a comedy about family and relationships. Then, Leslie Mann's character and voice seriously made me homicidal. Not to mention, when the daughter went off on her tirade even if you don't believe in hitting your kids, you would slap her across the face. Oh yeah and then, these people constantly worry about not having money, but go on trips for the weekend and drive BMW's and Lexuses (Lexi?). Also, they get along great on their romantic weekend but then go back to normal (for them) the second the kids start griping. I have kids and yes some time away can be good, and yes kids are difficult, but if they are driving you to this level of insanity maybe you should not have had them. Also, WHO HAS THESE KIDS MOST OF THE TIME? Never since Ritchie Petrie have I seen kids that seem to disappear when not convenient to the plot. Bike riding, private workouts (how much does that cost btw?), dinners out, weekend trips, all without kids and we wonder why they are such out of touch parents? And I apparently am the only adult who doesn't do drugs. Why does every movie have to circle back to this? When did the entire US become Amsterdam? Bottom line, skip it or bootleg it, but don't pay for it, watch it on the Netflix :). So to all of you approaching 40 and possibly a little frightened, as an average person let me assure you, THIS ISN't 40!
B004G6009U|5.0|This is a great modern take on the classic story of Rapunzel.  The musical numbers are really good, the animation is wonderful, and the story is bright and interesting, keeping the children engaged. There are a lot of humorous little moments and witty comments which are fun for the parents!
B000002H33|5.0|A must have CD for your Heavy Metal Collection. Great sound quality. Its Metallicas finest works enough said. Buy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|like it because there is more characters than temple run. i love ti for my kids.i lov lov lov lov it
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis<br />30 #1 Hits<br /><br />There are only three sets that I needed to get all the entertainment I wanted from the Elvis catalog.  This CD is one of those three because it includes his greatest hits from the 60's and 70's (along with a few of his best 50's hits).  The other two sets I felt were necessary include the \\"King of Rock N Roll: The Complete 50's Masters\\" box set (because his Best work was done in the 1950s), and the DVD of his great \\"1968 Comeback Special\\".<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004VW5A The King of Rock 'N' Roll: The Complete 50s Masters [Box Set--Slipcase Edition]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000G7PO6W Elvis: '68 Comeback]]
B0012GMUI6|2.0|...there are a few Pros here and there, but not even Clapton's guitar and Sanborn's sax and Kamen's orchestration (and a fetching cartoon girl on the cover) can save this thing.  I realize this is supposed to be a real time, early-morning, emotional & confused, waking-dream hitchhiking sequence (and all of the chaos and intensity that naturally come with it).  However, and not surprisingly, it just doesn't come off that well as a listenable piece of music.<br /><br />I've tried and tried to like this thing for literally decades now.  And try as I might, I just can't fully get into it.  Sorry, Roger:  as much as I hate to say it, this album is basically The Cons of Hitchhiking.<br /><br />For die-hard fans of Mr Waters only.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I think this is one of the better ports of the game. Not only do I get to play a great game again on my phone, but I get to show my son what fun older games are!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|My wife and i really enjoyed this CD it had great change of pace and a great flow. We listened to it start to finish and found no songs that i didnt like.
0307887898|4.0|after investors came into our company upper management was told to read this book, we are a fortune 1000 company, about to make the 500 list.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|For me this movie musical even improved on the stage version. I loved the closeups during the singing. Intensely human, and universal in scope. No wonder it's the world's favorite musical.
0790729709|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. After Whitney's death I decided to finally buy it and watched it again. I cried, watching her singing - God blessed her with an amazing voice.<br />And the story -- great romance. Still one of my favorite movies.
B00004RJPW|5.0|It was great to buy this tape i love it thanks for sending it to me after I bought it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a great series of books - held my interest the entire time, great story!  Moving on to the prequels now!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Great tips in making any up loaded publication look professional and have the perks like Table of Contents, Chapter heading that you can jump too, etc. Answered questions i was looking for
0307888908|4.0|if you need some inspiration, pick up this book, it will give you the spur to start your entrepreneurial dream or enough of a boost to see it through.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I liked this a great deal but it could have shorn 20 minutes off without much loss. Loved the universal theme of devotion to home.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I loved this book. I have heard of Lee Child before but never really paid any attention until the new movie came out with Tom Cruise, which caused me to take a second look. Lots of action from the get go - I was never bored, was always on the edge of my seat, and couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read more Jack Reacher novels!
1452115567|4.0|Maddie on Things is simply a beautiful book. I found the photos a profound journey into Theron and Maddie's world, but also into myself. They help remind me to see the world in a clearer way, with openness, joy and presence. The remind me to also go on things whenever possible!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun and addicting color game. Slightly different than Bejeweled but very fun. Compete against your Facebook friends. You will spend hours playing game.
B008CX2A2I|4.0|It did what I needed it too do it is easy to use and I would suggest it to others also just great
1451695187|5.0|ORIGINALLY DOWNLOADED THIS TO MY TABLET READER AND ENJOYED IT. SINCE THEN I HAVE GIVEN TWO HARD COPIES TO FAMILY MEMBERS AS GIFTS, AND WILL LIKELY SEND COPIES TO OTHER LOVED ONES. THERE IS A GOOD LEVEL OF COMFORT THAT THIS BOOK PROVIDES TO EVEN THOSE WHO ARE SKEPTICS.
0545128285|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my nephew. He loved it! I personally have not read it or any of the Harry Potter stories.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|5 stars for makeup, wardrobe, props, sets and special effects.<br />5 stars for quality of Blu-ray transfer.<br /><br />2 stars for the film, its screenplay, content and themes. I was emotionally exhausted and empty after watching this film. There was nothing to reflect upon afterward, emotionally or intellectually. It didn't even fall into the \\"fun\\" films category like Beetlejuice, Rango or Depp's Alice in Wonderland. The frenzied pace of non-stop action begins within the first few minutes when the dwarves show up for dinner and continues without respite for the remainder of the film until the credits roll. The overwhelming bulk of this is back-to-back chase and battle scenes weilding axes, arrows and swords. It's the cinema version of the World of Warcraft MMPOG - emphasis on \\"massive.\\" The utterly unnecessarily complex screenplay is grossly bloated to create the first in a planned trilogy of full length feature films from a single, medium length novel. The novel's major underlying \\"Bildungsroman\\" themes - Bilbo Baggins' evolution - achieving worldly maturity through overcoming the trials of his journey - with his growth in understanding and grappling with the struggle between egocentrism and greed versus altruism - are completely lost - reducing it to nothing more than a fantasy action film on amphetamines.<br /><br />LOTR needed to be a trilogy to adequately cover Tolkein's 3 novels. The Hobbit novel could have - and should have - been adapted as one (likely long) feature film. But wait, that wouldn't milk the franchise cash cow that another blockbuster trilogy could with 3x or more box office receipts. The original novel is a much more worthwhile and satisfying story than this film.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game out there. It can be addictive and expensive , but that's how good it is. Keeps you wanna keep playing
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Limited by daily ticket amounts unless you choose to spend money. Once you get higher in game more tickets come.
B0067R0APK|4.0|It did what I needed it too do it is easy to use and I would suggest it to others also just great
B000ZN802W|5.0|This movie is wonderful. Coming of age and coming to life. Self exploration at its finest and most intimate at times. I highly recommend this movie for those who have the desire to find themselves and their place in this world.Intense, complex and enlightening.
0395389496|5.0|I remember reading this story as a kid in school. I've always loved it. I purchased it as a part of a holiday project I wanted to do with my own children who had only ever seen the movie and not read the book. I purchased it at the beginning of November and it did not arrive to me until Christmas eve. At that point I had already filed a claim since I had not received it and there was no tracking info. Either way the book is a classic. My children enjoyed it and I still enjoy it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall was a great movie and Daniel Craig carries the series on as a great successor to Sean Connery.  Super!
B005P89F1C|5.0|my bteloved boyfriend suggested i should buy this cd because he was'nt able to be under the misletoe with me last year:((!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great story, lush scenery, beautiful sets, gorgeous costumes, intellectual soap opera, addicting, education about the time period, free Mr. Bates!
B000IDEORY|4.0|It is a super movie great cast and characters I watch it over and over I would suggest it to others also just great
B000KIPD5E|5.0|The switch works exactly as advertised;  well built, low noise and good features.  I like having gain controls on the two inputs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read all three books three times already and they are just as good as they were the first time I read them!
B00471JSR4|4.0|Prior to GI2, I ordered this flick to see with my brother. Movie was so-so. Added bonus was the discounted ticket for GI2
0670020745|5.0|i had a stroke 6+ years ago and this book came highly recommeded to me in my stroke support group!  in fact, this is a replacement one!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game! It's somehow calming and stimulating at the same time. I have no complaints, lots of levels and I find it challenging. My only problem with it is that I'm ignoring Words with Friends because of it!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The controls are a little bit hard to control on this game, but my daughter still seems to enjoy it even though she dies pretty quickly.
B00BCV3HGU|1.0|If this album does anything at all, it will be from leeching off of the Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus fan bases. Most songs are unoriginal and if they're not legally sampled, they are stolen. Save your money and listen to what this thief and wannabe \\"producer\\" calls music on YouTube.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm twelve years old and my mom and I loved playing this game together! We hope they make more Room games very very soon!!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I love this game!!!  It's one of the better match 3 games I've played!!!!!  It's challenging and fun!  Good game to spend some lost hours playing!  Especially for a free version.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|season 2 was just as good as season 1.<br />i don't get to watch during the season.<br />i can hardly stand the wait for season 3
078322933X|1.0|i have to say i love reese witherspoon and like mark wahlberg.but this movie did not do it for me.maybe if i had watched the complete movie my rating would have been different.so you may want to rent it first before buying.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|A good racing game that requires good hand eye coordination.  I like that you can adapt the controls to tilting the kindle in the correct direction.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series .its all i have been reading when I get the chance.almost better that 50 shades but its comes in at a close second and I have now found a new author to look forward to reading .
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I've been a long time fan.  This new album takes me back to clutchs earlier stuff.  Me likey a lot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game I'm so happy I got it for my kindle fire!!!!!!! I hope they come out with subway surfers 2!!!!!
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|I LOVE Justin Timberlake. I was super excited to get the vinyl album! I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone that likes to listen to records. The case is awesome too!!
B00B22IJXK|3.0|I thought it was fun, although, it was not what I thought it was going to be. You cannot do what the pictures make you think you can. That's why I gave it a 3 star rating.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but when I first saw the movie in the theatre I didn't like it.  It seemed too opulent, particularly coming right during the recession.  My husband insisted, however, that it was much better than the first movie, and was much closer to the series.  On second viewing I must admit that I agree with him and was really able to enjoy it for the frothy, sexy, silly, awkward, punny experience of it.
0765325950|5.0|Anyone that's made it this far into the series needs very little preamble: The Wheel of Time is amazing, from start to finish, and it's well worth the trip.
B005CMSDLE|1.0|I love the movie Hanna, it has to be one of my top favs, but when i got the disk and put it into my DVD drive on my computer, it almost short circuited my entire system. Why? Because the company pulled off a sticky label of sorts from the top of CD and it was getting stuck on my player inside my computer. No i have to find a way to seal it up so i can watch it. I wasn't impressed with the 15 minutes i had to spend trying to get the disk out.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|Not up to These guys standard, or maybe nothing can be better then Dragon trainer. I had some bad luck that the disc was faulted in the middle of the film, like hacking, when reading
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run two is by far the best of the temple run series I hope you creaters make temple run three even better than this one good job
B0007P0XNC|3.0|Great movie...I wish there was a language option so I could see it in Italian with English subtitles as the dubbing version is kind of poor... At one point the image gets distorted...but I'm sure it's more of an hassle to return it than to just hang on until it goes back to normal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It s great and I really like to play the game. It's a great pastime you should download this game so stop reading this and download this game supper fun now!!!!!!!
1616960922|5.0|The Emperor's Soul is very short- it barely broke 100 pages if I remember right- but Sanderson still manages to tell an interesting story and hint at a larger, rich world in a minimalist format. If you need a shorter book to keep you busy through a short plane ride or something similar, this one would be among my top recommendations.
B0073U2FB2|5.0|Still really like this movie! I wanted to punch the blonde one in the face soooo many times but yeah:)
B004BSWC8A|5.0|Ive seen this film before and its still a very good film. Actors play excellent. Buy it if you havnt seen it
B005J4TLN4|5.0|Attack the Block was an entertaining and original sci-fi<br />movie that showed either alien or manmade-black razor<br />teeth dogs, attacking youth on their block after they killed<br />one of their own.  Leaving the scent of animal odor on<br />Moses, the youth are hunted down, and I mean hunted<br />down.<br /><br />P.S. Richie Spice nailed the the song Youths Are So Cold too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had a very detailed description of everything and a great ending i am dieing to buy the third book, cant wait!!!!
B00AIJP9BS|2.0|When I got this game I was thinking that the other team would be controlling them....... BUT NOT!!! Other than that I think it's pretty good. So get this if you want to but don't say that I didn't tell u so!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Liked the game so far. Im not sure how far you could go without actually spending real mony to purchase stuff. It might get to a point that real advancement beyond the basic elements might not be possible but its been fun so far. Good graphics and nice execution. Give it a try
B000093BDX|5.0|Dyanmite CD!  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  Wish I could jump back into time and hug those guys!  If I could, I would give this a 10 star rating!  Yes indeed!  Thank you for letting it be available! :)  That's a smile face!

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I appreciate the quality of the acting and the writing of period pieces produced for PBS whether US or UK.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Season 4 leaves you saddened after Dexter's lovely wife Rita is murdered by the Serial Killer he is stalking.  He takes the blame and rightfully so as he had opportunity to kill him earlier several times.  However curiosity got the better of him wanting to understand this killers life and when get got too close and too involved he paid the price.<br /><br />This season he gets a side-kick the question becomes is that good or bad or will she end up like Rita in the end.

1401223176|5.0|This work is a tour de force, literally a \\"feat of strength.\\" It is a monumental accomplishment in the comics genre. It's an excellent addition to the rich archives belonging to the Batman family of stories (and that's coming from a guys who's mainly a Marvel fan, folks!).<br /><br />Writing---Excellent, excellent. The way Jeph Loeb tells this story is simply brilliant. You often get three things happening at once, (A) Batman's thinking/narration, (B) Batman's speech, and (C) the speech of other characters. Now, I would normally think that's a recipe for disaster, but Loeb pulls it off like a pro. It becomes almost symphonic. And the dialog is brilliant.<br /><br />Pencils---Jim Lee's artwork is amazing. He was brilliant with Marvel \\"back in the day\\" on the X-Men titles and such, but in this volume, \\"Hush,\\" you can see that he has grown in all facets of his illustrating prowess. If I can single out one thing in particular, it's this: Jim Lee has become one of the best story-tellers with his illustration that has ever been in the comics business. His Batman is second to none.<br /><br />Inks & Colors---just spectacular. Enough that the artist personally thanks them in a couple pages at the end (at least in the single-volume, paperback edition I have). Sometimes loosely monochromatic, sometimes vivid and colorful, sometimes dark and moody---they made all the right choices on every single friggin' page.<br /><br />Lettering---Yes, dangit, even the lettering is superb! Batman's thoughts/narration are in a nice blue thought cloud, in contrast to speech. Also, the lettering is characteristically \\"out of the way,\\" for lack of a better term. It doesn't hide the brilliant artwork.<br /><br />I am so glad I bought this volume. It has a rich selection of characters, a super story, brilliant art, and is loads of fun.

B00005V0X5|4.0|The creation of Megadeth is, in many ways, a comic book story.  One Dave Mustaine, guitarist and lyricist extraordinaire, has a nasty time with his bandmates in that other band, to the point where he is booted out before their first album is released.  Mustaine, not being known for his capacity for civil discourse and amiability, vows vengeance.  In a cutaway, we see his visage darken, and a hidden figure behind him whispering, \\"You're gonna destroy Metallica!\\" and waving the devil horn sign.  But instead of fusing cybernetic enhancements to his body or attempting to melt the ice caps, Mustaine set out to compose an album that would make Ulrich and Hetfield whimper.<br /><br /> Despite Dave's best efforts, that didn't really happen, but what did come out of it is an uncontestably good debut for one of the longest running thrash bands out there.  Killing is My Business... And Business is Good set the template for the Megadeth style - namely, blistering, guitar-centric speed and acrobatic solos sprinkled liberally throughout.  Dave's somewhat obsessive fixation on overlong album titles and ellipses notwithstanding, there is a great deal of amazing stuff here that stands with the band's best material, even if it is largely forgotten nowadays.<br /><br /> The first thing this album makes clear to the listener is speed.  Leaving aside Slayer, Megadeth is the fastest of the Big Four of thrash metal, so this fact alone doesn't come as a particular surprise to anyone.  However, the enthusiasm with which Killing is My Business... I'm Out of Breath steps on the throttle, cuts the brake line, and generally does its speedy-as-a-really-speedy-thing routine may come as a surprise to those who haven't ventured far before Countdown to Extinction.  Most of the appeal of the album comes from this relentless pace, but is further bolstered by some very catchy Motorhead-style riffs to drop in the occasional mid-tempo section.<br /><br /> While the quality of Killing is My Business... And This Title Goes On? is definitely high, Megadeth's time at bat has rarely been perfect, and there are a couple misses among the hits.  Gar Samuelson is criminally underutilized on some tracks, particularly \\"Chosen Ones\\", which is absurd considering how talented he was.  And unlike some other thrash bands of the day, Megadeth's compositional skill wasn't all there.  They could lay down riffs with the best of them, but didn't always have the ability to craft a song that would stick with the listener.  While I can remember most songs off of Kill `Em All - this album's closest relative - and recreate them riff for riff in my head, Killing is (Screw it)... tends to blend together during its 30 minute running time.  Rather than memorable individual tunes, there's just that overwhelming sense of speed that's amazing while you listen, but doesn't stick with you long afterwards.  While that is in no way a bad thing on its own, it does explain why this isn't exactly a well-remembered release.<br /><br /> And that's a shame, because under its slightly tarnished surface, this is a record that should be on any thrash fan's all-time-great list.  \\"Last Rites/Loved to Deth\\" is one of the best openers Megadeth has ever recorded.  With a ludicrous number of riffs laid down in the short, but blistering four minutes of its running time, it's amazing that it doesn't fling itself to pieces from the sheer centrifugal force of playing it.  Against all odds, though, it holds together.  The same, unfortunately, cannot be said of \\"Looking Down the Cross\\", which has a number of great ideas that simply don't come together in the end, and ends with a whimper rather than a bang.<br /><br /> All of the other tracks hold up well, always playing with a new catchy bit and bob, and just generally wreaking havoc on the notion of manageable beats per minute, right up and through \\"Mechanix\\", a song from Dave's pre-Metallica days.  Personally, although some may prefer Peace Sells or Countdown to Extinction, this is my second-favorite \\"classic\\" Megadeth record, right behind Rust in Peace.  It left a lasting influence on the band, too - remnants of this style can be heard in later songs like \\"Good Morning/Black Friday\\" even as they were tightening up their sound.  It's not perfect, but if the goal is to \\"rattle your goddamn head\\", it will more than suffice.ion, this is my second-favorite \\"classic\\" Megadeth record, right behind Rust in Peace.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|I remember clearly where I was when I first heard this album.  My buddy and I were in his basement playing ping pong when he put the album on and said....&#34;You've got to hear this new band.&#34;  After listening to the debut album, I went out the next day and bought the 8 track AND the album.  I was eighteen.<br /><br />Now at 56 I've owned this album in a ton of different formats including cassette, the first pressings of the cd version, and when I found out that Tom Scholz had remastered this in 2006, I thought...where in the heck have I been?  For the most part, I'm pretty fed up with buying the same album in every new format that comes along, but this is an exception.<br /><br />Scholz does a great job, and why wouldn't he, on remastering this compact disc.  It sounds great.  I loved the liner notes.  I'm an old school guy, not much into MP3's or Flacs or Kindles,  I like holding something in my hands to read when I'm listening to my music.  It's a throwback to the old album days when you could read the album covers, read the lyrics, look at what musician or guest musician played a respective instrument.  And this has it.<br /><br />It felt like I was 18 and in that basement again hearing it for the first time.  Love the remaster!  Sorry so late in picking it up.

B0090SI4LU|1.0|The Host is the type of movie that every viewer will go into view with an opinion already formed.  Fans of the Stephanie Meyer novel it is based on will go in hoping for a faithful adaption of their beloved story.  And if internet backlash can be believed, a not-insignificant portion will also go in deriding it as the blackest scorch mark on the face of cinema and literature yet seen by mankind.  You already know which group you fall into, and film version of The Host will not change your mind at all.<br /><br /> For my part, I land firmly in the latter camp of Host-decriers, perhaps not with the same fiery and virulent hatred that some possess, but still pretty firmly put off by the two distressingly long hours of its running time.  It's not a particularly long film, but watching it is a small eternity filled with nothing but unintentionally hilarious melodrama, painfully dull set-pieces, nonsensical plotting, interchangeable characters, passionless romance, and occasional offensiveness.<br /><br /> Gleefully rubbing salt in the wound is the fact that the opening ten minutes is actually fairly compelling.  Our protagonist Melanie is in a bit of a tight spot, hunted down by mere shells of humans, their bodies controlled by small aliens resembling fuzzy slugs.  If this was the `90's, this would have been an action movie called Animorphs, but these are the teenage years of the 21st century, and we instead get an awkward romance called The Host instead.  Thanks, Hollywood.  Admittedly, it's one with rather high stakes - humanity as we know it is all but gone, with nearly every person alive taken over by aliens.<br /><br /> Melanie brilliantly escapes by jumping out of a six-story window and putting herself in a coma.  The somber alien-men scoop her up from the crater left in the concrete and slide a new slug-alien into her.  This alien - Wanderer, as she likes to be called - is meant to help find the last of the human resistance using Melanie's remaining memories.  As they soon find out, though, Melanie's mind is not snuffed out like most humans.  She stays around, now effectively a disembodied voice sharing a body with the meek and unemotional Wanderer.<br /><br /> How exactly this works is never made clear.  The Host has as much internal consistency as an unblended smoothie.  Sometimes Melanie can take control, other times she's completely helpless and unable to even make herself heard.  Melanie eventually tricks Wanderer into leaving the safety of the alien society, and meeting up with the human resistance.  From there on out, the film turns into a romance between Melanie's boyfriend from before her assimilation, and another boy Ian, who falls for the alien in her head.<br /><br /> And that's it.  I'm going to be honest - no matter what anyone says, as a concept, The Host has an excellent premise.  Besides the huge potential for backstory and setting - it's our own world, run by an entirely different species - the concept of two intelligences sharing the same body could make for some seriously compelling science fiction.  What relation does the intellect have with the body?  Are we only what others see us to be?  Are we all, to some extent, a prisoner in our own minds?<br /><br /> But no, we'd much rather see some ham-fisted romance, corny dialogue, and senseless plotting.  The larger overarching questions about the fate of humanity are never answered over the film's running time.  Neither is the \\"sharing a body\\" element ever used in any thought-provoking manner, other than to set up the film's awkward love-quadrilateral.  It's a massive missed opportunity.<br /><br />  Beyond that, the implications here are seriously problematic.  As Wanderer is gradually accepted into the human resistance group, everyone involved seems remarkably uninterested in the fact that her people have essentially committed genocide on a massive scale.  Not to mention the burgeoning relationship between her and Ian.  It's a fluffy, insubstantial love story that one would expect from a teen movie, where emotion springs from nowhere and passion is a synonym for idiocy.  But factor in the fact that Melanie is watching helplessly as Ian kisses Wanderer with her own body, and what would have been only eye-roll inducing is now borderline sickening.<br /><br /> Hyperbole is cheap, and The Host has had its fair share directed its way.  But it is, without exaggeration, an embarrassingly bad film.  There simply isn't enough space to list its problems - sets that are completely indistinguishable from each other, lackluster performances, gaping plot-holes, and a shockingly poor grasp of basic science (growing crops in a dormant volcano IN NEW MEXICO) only brush the surface of all that's wrong with it.  Perhaps - as several people have insisted to me - the book is much better.  I would call that damning with faint praise, but by all means, stick with the book and avoid this one like you would a fuzzy white pocket-lint alien slug.tory that one would expect from a teen movie, where emotion springs from nowhere and passion is a synonym for idiocy.

Like any great kids movie it deals with very heavy adult issues and it does so in a way that is easy to explain to children.<br /><br />The use of 3D hasn't stood up as well as the story however.  While there are good uses in a few scenes Up does not stand up well against Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc. which were converted to 3D a few years later.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality movie that both children and adults can enjoy, look no further.

B00B4804KS|5.0|It's more than a little uncommon for a film to visually impress two times in a row.  What made for spectacular viewing the first time becomes old news by the second.  And with the rate at which the technologies used at the movies advances, these former special-effects heavyweights begin to look dated very quickly.<br /><br /> That makes it all the more impressive that Jurassic Park 3D - a classic celebrating its 20th birthday this year - is still eye-poppingly amazing to look at.  The special effects alone have aged like a fine wine, due in no small part to the film's reliance on animatronics over computer animation.  Whereas CGI tends to leave everything looking just slightly \\"off\\", the dinosaurs of this park feel as real as they come.  There's none of that oddly shiny, too-perfect look of modern movies.<br /><br /> Someone at Universal deserves a pat on the back for the job of converting this movie to 3D.  The original was obviously never filmed with 3D in mind, but the new sense of depth is completely convincing.  It is, in a word, awesome.  And in a movie that has the awesomeness of the natural world as a major theme, that really helps to sell it to you.<br /><br /> Behind Jurassic Park's new bells and whistles is the same excellent Spielburgian film it has always been.  John Hammond, a visionary scientist, has had a jolly old time playing around with genetics.  The fruit of his labor is a private island filled with creatures long since extinct, which he wants to make into an amusement park.  He invites three scientists - the couple Alan and Ellie, and the eccentric ladies' man Ian Malcolm - for some academic cred, as his investors are having some trouble believing that resurrecting long-extinct T. Rex's is actually safe.  The opening act allows us time to soak in just how incredible this prehistoric wonderland really is.  From the huge beasts, to the hatching of a tiny infant raptor, the world of Jurassic Park is wild, but seemingly controlled.<br /><br /> Controlled that is, except for the park's malicious computer programmer, Newman - err, Dennis Nedry.  In an attempt to steal dinosaur embryos for a rival genetics company, Nedry inadvertently shuts down the park's security, releasing the hordes, including one hungry T. Rex.  The delightfully carefree and safe dino zoo quickly turns into a prehistoric nightmare, with the scientists, Hammond, and his grandchildren all fighting to survive.<br /><br /> Jurassic Park knows what it wants to be - it's a science-fiction thriller, and it does that well.  There are more iconic scenes here than a raptor has teeth.  Beyond that, though, it's effective as something of a pseudo-nature documentary.  When they aren't trying to gobble up the heroes, the dinosaurs simply go about their business - running with their herds, finding a meal, and nesting for the night.  It's a grim reminder of humanity's dualistic relationship with nature.  Sometimes we live in harmony and mutual wonder.  Sometimes  they eat us instead.<br /><br /> The acting is mostly excellent, particularly with Jeff Goldblum as Ian.  His sarcastic skepticism plays off of the other scientists' straight-man performances hilariously well.  Richard Attenborough also does a wonderful job as Hammond and his rapidly-decaying ego.  Despite the fact that the entire park was his idea, you do feel sorry for the man as his dream crumbles to pieces around him.  While the characters are not the centerpieces (Jurassic Park is much more War of the Worlds than ET), it helps the film immensely to have such engaging performances.<br /><br /> Jurassic Park is definitely worth a second viewing, especially in 3D.  The added dimension fits the film perfectly, as if it were shot that way all the way back in 1993.  And if you're somehow lucky enough for this to be your first viewing, than enjoy.

B00C1XZ2LQ|2.0|I've been a fan of M83 ever since the summer that [[ASIN:B0016CS0IK Saturdays = Youth]] came out. Their music felt like something I'd been searching for my whole life. Reminicent of 80's synth and shoegaze, M83 was a sound that felt like it could have been the soundtrack to my teenage years. When I heard that Anthony Gonzales, the creative mind behind M83, was tasked with scoring the next movie by Tron Legacy's director, I could not have been more excited. I'm a huge fan of Tron Legacy and I grew up loving the original. While many don't agree with my positive sentiment towards [[ASIN:B004R63MWQ Tron: Legacy]] the film, everyone pretty much agrees that the Daft Punk score is one of the the best done for any movie. So the prospect of a band I love working with the director of Tron Legacy on his new film was like a match made in heaven...that is until I walked out of those theater doors earlier today.<br /><br />I write this review mostly for the purposes of letting people know that this is NOT the next M83 album. It is a score for an action/adventure sci-fi movie starring Tom Cruise. Although it is composed and orchestrated by the leader of M83, this is not an M83 album. A majority of this score isn't reminicent of him in the slightest. A few tracks feature some synth and drumbeats that sound right out of an M83 album, but a lot of it is just generic sci-fi movie orchestral music. The moments where M83's sound shine through are the highlights of the score, but they're few and far between.  Where Daft Punk was able to create some great orchestrations mixed with their techno/dance sound, M83's influence is sparce at best. While watching the movie I pretty much forgot that the guy behind M83 was responsible for the score.<br /><br />From a few interviews I read with Anthony Gonzales, he had a little creative control over the sound of the score in the end. While he still created the music and orchestrations with Joseph Trapanese, he said studio executives steered him to make it sound a specific way, leaving little to no room for M83's sound. In his interview for Pitchfork he even says that he wanted to leave the M83 moniker out of it and be credited solely as his real name. Though due to his recent popularity with \\"[[ASIN:B005NNWGDS Midnight City]]\\", the studio wanted to put M83 as the composer as part of the film's marketing. It is apparent that Gonzales did approach this project in a different way than an M83 album, and it's a shame that an expectation has been set with it because marketers wanted to associate the score with \\"[[ASIN:B005NNWGDS Midnight City]]'s\\" accolades. Had he been given more creative control, it could have been something epic. That said, the movie itself is pretty mediocre and it would have been a waste to have such a brilliant score accompanying it.<br /><br />This isn't an M83 album, and if you buy this solely for that reason, you'll be dissapointed. My going in expecting a score sounding similar songs like \\"Don't Save Us From The Flames\\" or \\"Moonchild\\" probably have something to do with much of my dissapointment. Though even then, looking at it solely as a movie score, it's still a pretty mediocre work. It sounds too similar to Hanz Zimmer's work with Christopher Nolan in many parts and even reminded me a bit of Tron's orchestral parts too. The final track is probably the best part of it, though it would barely pass as a B-Side on an M83 album. Though it's not offensively bad or anything like that. It's definately something I'd just have on in the background and not really seriously listen to. No doubt it won't get nearly as many plays as [[ASIN:B004EI3ON4 Tron: Legacy]], [[ASIN:B004WHOIKK Moon]], [[ASIN:B003U9TDII Inception]], or the Dark Knight  Trilogy scores on my iPod.<br /><br />In the end, this not the next M83 album, it's a score by Anthony Gonzales for a Tom Cruise sci-fi action movie. That's not to say that action sci-fi movies can't have quality scores, it's just this one should have been betterbecause of the caliber of musician behind it. While it doesn't seem like Gonzales is fully to blame for the final product, it's sad to see his creativity cut short by studio execs. I'd ask them, why even hire someone like the man behind M83 if you're not going to let him do what he does best and create a stellar score? I look forward to the day that a studio lets Mr. Gonzales have full creative control over a score. I just hope that when he is allowed such creativity that it gets paired with a movie that is not a boring mess like Oblivion.because of the caliber of musician behind it.

B008JFUNPK|1.0|At some point during the pre-production of The Croods, someone had to have said, \\"All right, we've got a large male caveman character, who performance mostly involves grunts and yelling loudly.  Who do we cast?\\"  At some point, someone suggested Nicholas Cage.  There's a joke here, but it's so obvious I'm not going to bother making it.<br /><br />In all fairness to Cage, his brand of overacting is perfectly suited to this cartoon.  The Croods problems lie with the film itself - it's simply boring.  Despite some amazing animation, and a talented group of voice actors, it meanders as purposelessly as the Cro-Magnon's in the starring roles.<br />The Croods are the last cavemen in their world, surviving only by following their credo, \\"Never try anything new\\", the irony of which seems to be lost on Hollywood.  By day, they attempt to scrounge food up from whatever source they can, and hide in their cave by night.  Eep, played by the talented Emma Stone, is sick of this lifestyle, and sneaks out at night, meeting the intelligent human Guy.  Guy plans on high-tailing it out of the gorge, as the world is evidently ending, rather spectacularly and for no particular reason.<br /><br />While father figure Grug (played by Cage) is initially against the idea of escape, a couple landslides is enough to change his mind.  According to Guy, a distant mountain represents safety from the impending volcano-landslide-flood apocalypse, so he and the family set off in that direction, with a jungle full of weird creatures the only thing in between them and survival.  The creature design is competent, but often seems a bit too garish compared to the often stark beauty of the prehistoric world's landscapes.  If Jurassic Park has starred large cartoon chickens instead of dinosaurs, it would have quite closely resembled The Croods.<br /><br />Unlike other movies of its persuasion - Ice Age comes to mind - The Croods resembles more of a series of vignettes than an actual plot.  The invention of shoes, an encounter with swarms of birds that eat like piranha, tar pits - it's all there, but not much of it really ends up mattering.  It's a loud movie rather than a truly funny one, which makes it clear the young audience it's targeting.  If you're older than 8, The Croods is not for you.  Those caveman toys that those 8-year-olds are going to expect you to buy them, however, are.shoes, an encounter with swarms of birds that eat like piranha, tar pits - it's all there, but not much of it really ends up mattering.

B00BUADSMQ|2.0|Oh, McClane, how far you have fallen.<br /><br />It can be difficult to judge the latest film in a series on its own merits, because it will inevitably be viewed in comparison to the legacy of the films before it.  In the case of A Good Day to Die Hard, what could have been a decent Bruce Willis-fronted action blockbuster on its own crumbles under the weight of the prior, superior films.  In a vacuum, the film is perfect for an hour or two of brainless fun, but when everything accomplished here has been done better in prior films, it leaves the diehard Die Hard fan cold.<br /><br />Where the first film was an excellent pastiche of the disaster movies popular in the 70's, and the then-contemporary 80's action hero, A Good Day to Die Hard plays out as more of an awkward blend of the recent James Bond films and the excesses of modern action video games.  The film still stars Bruce Willis's John McClane - the classic \\"cop who's seen a lot\\" - finding himself in way over his head, but that's where the similarities end.  This time around, our hero travels to Russia to reunite with his prison-bound estranged son (played almost begrudgingly by Jai Courtney).  Much to McClane Sr.'s surprise, though, his son is not a deadbeat criminal, but a CIA agent undercover working to smuggle a person of interest out of Russia.  McClane manages to quickly derail the entire mission, forcing Jr. and Sr. to team up and find another way out.<br /><br />There is more plot beyond that, but the film loses coherency so quickly that it isn't worth recounting.  Instead, A Good Day to Die Hard throws action scene and setpiece one after another at the viewer in an increasingly thickening flurry of action, like a budget-rate magician trying to disguise the fact that his bag of tricks has run dry.  Cars are driven recklessly.  Guns are shot.  Expendable henchmen are killed en masse.  Half-hearted jokes are made.  Callbacks to previous films are made and forgotten just as quickly.  The meat of the film is this unrelenting pace of frenzied action.  And when all is said and done, it's fairly satisfying.  Leaving aside some occasionally clumsy cinematography, the fights spare no extravagance and are generally entertaining to watch.<br /><br />Less than fun is the truly clumsy exposition and half-hearted acting by the main cast.  The shamelessly convoluted plot of the film serves only to hide the fact that it has more holes in it than McClane's assault rifle has bullets.  This only gets worse as the film goes on.  Courtney seems to only want to collect his paycheck and leave, and Willis appears simply incredulous that he's actually managed to end up in a fifth Die Hard movie at all.  The only halfway interesting character is the mysterious Yuri Komarov (played by Sebastian Koch), the person of interest the two McClane's are attempting to save.  Unfortunately, his character is given little to truly do, and rarely ever allowed to be more than a pawn.<br /><br />In the end, A Good Day to Die Hard is not disappointing because it's big, loud, and dumb.  It's quite good at that.  It's not even that it is inferior to the other films in the series.  What is bothersome about it is that it has no respect for its source material.  The John McClane of this film is not the same one as that of the earlier films.  Instead of the original Die Hard's subtle and mostly realistic world, A Good Day to Die Hard opts for a comic book universe where these men can shrug off a hailstorm of bullets and hundred-foot falls and walk away with a swagger.  The winking references to earlier films come off as cheap and unfunny, and almost ironic, as if the film is ashamed of its much better predecessors.<br /><br />In the context of the larger series it is a part of, A Good Day to Die Hard is a very weak film.  Taken on its own, it's a fun, brainless way to spend a little under two hours.  With that said, one viewing is really all this movie is ever going to be able to offer anyone before they box itaway in the attic and watch Die Hard With a Vengeance again instead.  See it, enjoy it, forget it.away in the attic and watch Die Hard With a Vengeance again instead.  See it, enjoy it, forget it.

B00C5W3SBE|4.0|Oz fans: how well do you remember the thrilling world of the original 1939 film?  Was your favorite part the amazingly realized world of L. Frank Baum's novel, done entirely without CGI?  Perhaps it was the gentle, subtle, Carroll-like satire it had?  Or maybe Judy Garland's career-defining performance as Dorothy?  How would you see all of that come together again in a new Oz film?  Assuming you answered \\"Heck, yeah!\\", the good news is that Oz: The Great and Powerful has all of that.  The bad news is that it contains a significantly smaller dose of each.<br /><br /> To its credit, the film is not a thin parody of the classic it was based on.  Many reboots of beloved films often take on a slightly cynical bent, paying lip service to their inspiration, but also putting on a thinly-veiled mockery of it.  \\"Isn't it cute how innocent and earnest these old movies used to be?\\", they seem to ask.  Director Sam Raimi (The Spiderman Trilogy) thankfully avoids this entirely - the new Oz is clearly in love with the old.  This is seen no clearer than in the opening ten minutes - the film begins in black-and-white in a 4:3 aspect ratio, before becoming a fully colored fullscreen when the story reaches Oz.  Not only does this mirror the first film, but it also acts as an effective homage to Hollywood's golden age.<br /><br /> We're quickly introduced to our hero, Oscar \\"My friends call me Oz\\" Diggs.  Oscar is a sleazy stage magician, who happens to moonlight as a heartbreaker.  Likeable, right?  Unfortunately, James Franco is neither charming enough to make us like him despite this, nor is he particularly convincing at it anyway.  He over-acts when he should under-act, and he does it a lot.  Ironically, Franco is at his most convincing when playing his stage magician persona, where his hammy performance is actually intended.  After wishing to become a great man (incidentally, something you should never do if you don't want the General Film Law of Protagonist Motivations to suck you into a dangerous adventure), Oscar is brought to Oz in a spectacular sequence by tornado.  The cinematography here is wonderful, quickly immersing us in the fantastic world of Oz without being disorienting or overwhelming.<br /><br /> Oscar meets the witch Theodora (played by Mila Kunis), and quickly learns he is prophecied to be a wizard come to save Oz from destruction.  The opportunistic conman that he is, Oscar accepts this title, and, bafflingly quickly, manages to romance Theodora.  While Mila Kunis is an excellent actor, she's clearly out of her element in the land of Oz, and later plot developments only serve to make this more obvious.  While saying more would venture into spoiler territory, the film destroys the potentially interesting character developments she begins to go through in an uninteresting second-act twist.<br /><br /> And that is largely the source of the film's problems.  Raimi's vision of Oz is spectacular, and the supporting cast is strong, but Franco and Kunis simply aren't the likeable main cast a film like this needs.  Judy Garland provided an excellent role in the first Oz, not just because of the skill of her performance, but because the audience identified with her.  She was a stranger in a very strange land, just like the audience, and that helped to center the movie.  Oz: The Great and Powerful, unfortunately, does not have its own Judy Garland.  Franco simply comes off as a charicature at times, and Kunis has been forced into a role that doesn't suit her.<br /><br /> In the end, it's a coin toss whether any one movie-goer will find this to be a worthwhile Friday night.  I enjoyed it, but that may have been from comparing it to the even more mediocre Jack the Giant Slayer.  This is a very visual movie, and begs to be seen in 3D.  Otherwise, it's most likely a rental.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: While I viewed and enjoyed the film, I did not purchase a DVD copy for myself, and thus cannot comment on the quality of the tangible item.As many reviewers have stated, there does not appear to be a 2D/3D combo pack, and that should be taken into consideration before one makes a purchase.As many reviewers have stated, there does not appear to be a 2D/3D combo pack, and that should be taken into consideration before one makes a purchase.

B00BEJL3IY|2.0|The fantasy genre has been in a bit of a rut for the past 5 or so years.  The young adult fiction genre is rife with a glut of derivate sword-and-sorcery series looking to piggy-back off of the success of Harry Potter, and they are largely becoming more and more indistinguishable from each other.  A great deal of the film industry's material, unfortunately, also comes from this tired pool of bland teenage protagonists, rehashed plot points and settings, and frequently embarrassing attempts at edginess.  It takes a stellar fantasy film nowadays to be able to be noticed as a gem among slag.<br /><br /> Jack the Giant Slayer is definitely not one of these films.  It has neither the enthusiasm to be a faithful retelling of the fairy tale, nor does it have the talent backing it to make it an intriguing retelling.  It simply exists, a film that doesn't particularly seem to care if it is watched or not, just as long as it makes Warner Bros. some money.<br /><br /> While it's doubtful that anyone needs the plot summarized for them, Jack the Giant Slayer stars the titular hero Jack, who does numerous tedious things, meets tedious people, and slays surprisingly few tedious giants.  He is played (tediously), by Nicholas Hoult, who has mastered the art of \\"green-screen face\\", the act of staring blankly past the camera with a look of slack-jawed not-quite-amazement.  I suspect the producer was dangling his check in front of him.  As you might expect, Jack is given some beans by a monk, the purpose of which is to keep the out of the hands of the nefarious Lord Roderick.  Roderick also happens to be well on his way to marrying the princess, Isabella, and becoming heir to the king's throne.  Despite his all too short amount of screen time, Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job as Roderick, adding some much needed hamminess to a film that takes itself much too seriously.  He's arrogant and outrageous in the classic style of Disney villains, and his scenes are where the film shines brightest.<br /><br /> The role of love interest is taken by Isabella herself, played by Eleanor Tomlinson.  Much like her co-star, she plays a character as bland as sawdust, leaving no doubt in the viewer's mind that these two tedious characters will likely fall tediously in love, have a tedious wedding by the end of the film, and likely end up with more than one tedious child.  Her dissatisfaction with being made to marry Roderick brings her to Jack's dump of a home, right before he manages to accidently get one of the beans wet, growing a massive beanstalk that carries her away.  Poor guy.<br /><br /> The king is understandably upset, and sends Jack, Roderick, and Ewan McGregor (playing not-Obi-wan Kenobi) up the beanstalk to retrieve her.  Roderick is all too happy to volunteer, as his plans involve taking control of the hundreds of sky-bound CGI giants, and using them to conquer the kingdom.  While this second act should have been spectacular, considering the expense taken to render the massive environments of the giants' world, nothing in particular really sticks.  Forests and rocky caves are the name of the game here, and there's never anything truly new to look at.  Even the sense of scale is lacking - being in a giant's world should be fascinating to see characters interact with, as even the simplest tasks can be impossible when they suddenly struggle to scale one stair-step.  But despite the fact that this world is built for beings 20 times larger than they are, this size difference is rarely even noticeable.  The film simply doesn't emphasize it, perhaps in an attempt to be as boring as its main character.<br /><br /> I'll give the film credit for a fine example of faithfulness to the culture and dress of the time period.  Beyond that, the finale is well done, and much better than the boring hour that precedes it.  But none of that can make up for the fact that this is, really, a boring, pointless film.  The story of Jack and the Beanstalk has been told numerous times, from the classic and lovable Disney animated short, to the odd and overlong, but fascinating Jim Henson movie Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story.  Jack the Giant Slayer, on the other hand, has neither charm nor a worthwhile thing to add to the story, and no real reason to exist.
