B00009Z574|3.0|Tormato (1978) is much different than previous Yes releases. While progressive rock is obviously more complex than straight rock, this album manages to feature complex arrangements and an array of sounds, as well as long-winded lyrics. This album is definitely an acquired taste, and unfortunately I'm not one of those who can listen to this album and adore it as one of my most prized possessions. There are, however, some gems on this album. I really like DON'T KILL THE WHALE, as well as ON THE SILENT WINGS OF FREEDOM, with its excellent bass and percussion. For something very different, give CIRCUS OF HEAVEN a try; this song is long-winded lyrically, but the music triggers the imagination. The rest of the album is filled with lesser efforts, though ONWARD has a nice touch, and is okay. This album is decent, but not where you want to start a Yes album collection. Instead, start with Fragile, Close to the Edge, or The Yes Album.
098478280X|3.0|I bought this book for my campus onsite interviews. As many reviews have pointed out, detailed explanations of interview processes, wide range of problems, and solutions with Java code. Studying it very hardly for two weeks actually gives me a very clear picture about what the interviews I will encounter. However, as I advanced to the next round of interviews, I found the problems in this book, although really classic, needs to expand to a deeper level. For example, the interviewers will sometimes ask similar questions in this book as opening questions, after that the follow-up questions are usually much difficult than previous one, and the technique mentioned in this book mostly cannot be applied in solving such problems. My classmates and I encountered such awkward situations over and over again; probably because this book is positioned as a introductory book for interview instead of a book you can learn techniques for hard onsite interview problems and practice. In conclusion, if you need to know what interview is and knowing Java well, this book is an awesome choice as a starter; after that, you definitely need find more substantial one for you to advance.
B008OOYALE|5.0|There are so many facets to this game, the main ones being the breeding, hatching, care and feeding of dragons. You have to provide specific habitats for each kind of Dragon, evolution chambers, breeding dens, nests for hatching, farms to grow food....there is also a social aspect where you can add \\"friends\\" and \\"play\\" with their dragons so they can earn coins ( you need coins to purchase the items you need to raise raise your dragons)..and to gift gold to them for purchases..  Then they return the favor to you. You can also chat if you like.  And one of the best things about this is that you play at your leisure. I highly recommend this game.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I watched this movie not once, but twice, it was so good, I highly recommend it, on my scale, I give it A two thumbs up
B005K17RU0|5.0|To me this is much more useful and convenient than weather apps put out by other sources. It has all the info I need at a glance. If I want more info it is just half a swipe away. Very quick and easy to use and their reports have been very accurate for my area. Radar maps are included as well as the option to add other locations. Works great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00005JMXX|5.0|global warming, fact? or fiction?<br />this movie bring to life the cataclysmic events that could happen, and may in fact happen<br />it really makes you wonder, should I burn another tank of gas, thinking eh, maybe they're wrong, but what if they're not?
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I'm not going to be a movie critic in my review.  Product was delivered as described and everything worked fine.  No complaints.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't get what all the fuss was about.No stars. I won' be buying the next books. bye from me.
B00C2IGQFG|4.0|This well acted and intenseaction drama exceeded my expectations. It was cast well, writen well, and the actoes delivered on their roles enough to make you, like in Heat, root for the bad guys. My one star deduction was geared more toward that reason. While original in setting and the dynamic and drive of most of the characters it bares too much resemblence to Heat, and is shot in what is either flattery or ripoff of Michael Manns style. While good, and carried out well, I think it leans a little too much on heist movies that have come before it, and should have stood up on its own accord.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Me and my family and friends like to play guess the emoji it is fun my hold family really like this game
B005LAII4E|3.0|Well, if you are looking for a flick to watch and just enjoy with your brain shut off, while enjoying some decent wit, big explosions, and a lifelike version of the classic cartoon, then you will not be let down. Now, if looking for plot, development, or anything in the way of appreciative cinema... you might wanna skip it at the Redbox. Removal of almost the entire original team, dismissal of one of the main villains AND heroes without a single reason, and horrific writing that resembles a rough draft on a cocktail napkin. It is dumb fun, worth a rental if a fan of the franchise or toys, but if not in the mindset going in, have a lot of not liking it to do.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'll probably eventually take this off my Kindle Fire as I don't check Facebook that often anyway.  I find it a little confusing to use and not much shows on the screen. For people that post a lot and and/or don't have regular access to a laptop it's probably fine.
0385535147|5.0|After being seriously disappointed by,\\" The confession\\" I was very wary of reading another Grisham book. So glad I did. Loved the racketeer.. Wow.. just could not put the book down. Total page turner and totally unexpected. Totally recommend this book for someone looking for some good suspense, great twists. Perfect summer read. Highly recommend it. Go Grisham!!
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|I surprisingly hadn't seen this movie before.  I had heard about it and seen clips in documentaries so I was aware of it, but just never saw the film in its entirety.  It was fantastic!  I loved it and actually found it to be pretty creepy and scary.  I don't scare easily, but this grew to be an uncomfortable movie to watch.  And that's a compliment to the genre.  It starts off light and as the movie progresses it grows more sinister and dark.  Definitely recommend if you haven't seen this yet.
0439813786|5.0|I picked this book up at my local used bookstore after flipping through it and admiring the illustrations throughout its pages. Visually, the presentation of the book was like nothing else I've seen before.<br /><br />I sat down to read The Invention of Hugo Cabret, and I was instantly in love. Through the combination of text and scenes \\"told\\" through illustrations, Selznick's book has easily become one of my favorites that I've read this year.<br /><br />It's hard to find just a few things I enjoyed about Hugo. The story touched the heart so effectively. It's about an abandoned, talented young boy. It's about an old man with a troubled past. Finding friendship and much more. There's also a fascinating tale surrounding the automaton and the history of inventions similar to it.  I think the fact that there is real-life history behind the story helps makes this book even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Even though this is a book written for a younger crowd, I feel that I appreciated it more in my mid-twenties than I would have if I had read this when I was younger. A child will love the story, and enjoy the pictures, as well. For me, this is an experience that doesn't depend on one's age. It's all about the magic created within this book. It knows no age.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Addictive. Great way to pass time, but frustrating when energy is gone but just go out come back once it's renewed and the fun continues
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Loving it!!  I wish the free tokens came more often!!!  It brings back super memories from childhood,  great job bringing this to kindle was a great idea!  Hats off to you!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|purely purfect. I love it. I had played it on someones ipad and I was soooooooo excited when it was free app of the day. it only took me 2 days to complete it all.:( it sooo needs a update
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is funny and addictive, can't stop playing it. Is just like Mario Bros but with Minions!  For an adult is easy to use, but for little kids... mmm.... can get hard. Every body should play this game!
B007TK77QE|3.0|I had anticipated this on the basis of a good friends review. Sadly it is one of the very few books that we will have to disagree on. Whilst parts were insightful the depth was lacking as the story covered too many characters with a similar level of intensity, so no one had any greater depth or meaning in the story.<br />It will try another book in due course, and perhaps her HP success created an unfair anticipation.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible App I have found. I love the versatility of the different reading plans. It comes in handy when sharing Christ with others because I am never without God's word.  It is so easy to movie about in the Bible that I use it more than my printed versions. God bless the people who made this possible.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Plan on playing your game many times. I'm a old time gamer and lost myself in this format. Finished in one day. PLEASE Bring more. You have a new fan thank you for the fun.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just as the title says, it's a breath taking book. So detailed  and moving! I felt as if I had known the characters in reality and it brought me to tears in some parts of the book. When I read the reviews, didn't believe I would cry since I've  never cried when reading a book before,but when I read this I has to try my hardest not to cry. It was so deeply written it got to me. Despite the sadness, there were parts that actually made me laugh out loud, which I've never had a book do to me! SPOILER ALERT: I literally could not stop laughing when Augustus told Issac's previous girlfriend's mom that a blind man was egging her daughter's car and to step back into her house. I definitely recommend this for young adults and teens because of the huge vocabulary needed to read and understand the book. There are 2 or 3 sexual scenes in the book such as SPOILER ALERT when Isaac was trying to arouse his girlfriend in front of the church, and another scene when Hazel and Augustus were in the bed. This book will definitely go on my shelf, and it is my favorite book. It really has changed my look on life and has moved me so greatly. This also inspired me to start a long forgotten book of my own. Thank you a million x infinity John Green for making this extraordinary book I will favor for life.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|Didn't enjoy playing this one, unfortunately.  Thankfully it was free, so I don't mind.  But it took too long to open and didn't entertain me enough to keep on my Galaxy S3.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!! It is very stupid!!!!!!!!!! This book should be burned!! I hate it and it is very bad i recommend for no one to read it!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Kept me busy for a while.  I like the challenges they offer, because it keeps you wanting to play more and more.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love it, it's better then the regular one they had that wasn't were you can play or connect to Facebook.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Some games were backwards.  Some games would close the app when I tried to play.  Some games worked but were poor graphics.
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|I recorded a very special story on my phone - but couldn't send it because it was a file type not read by some computers, whatever (I am NO techie).  The program I downloaded from Amazon converted the file from .3ga to MP3 with NO problem.  Hurrah.<br />Along the way I also downloaded ES File Explorer (free) because a prompt said it might be necessary to have some sort of file explorer program to make best use of the sound converter.<br />I am VERY happy [[ASIN:B0083B3KOQ File Converter]]  I am sure it does lots of other conversions, but haven't tried those yet - the MP3 conversion went flawlessly
B004SYP5WC|2.0|Didn't end up using it.  Don't know why... I guess it didn't have the look I was looking for in this kind of app.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|this was a great game.it was really fun and I love the fact that it was based on Alice in  Wonderland one of my favorite books.  it was challenging but not too hard a very good casual game.  it ended with out resolving.  personally I like to have some kind of resolving at the end of a game.  there are ways to resolve the game and still leave room for the next game in the series.  this is really just my personal preference.  if you like Alice in Wonderland you will like this game.
B005GVF95O|4.0|Downloaded for my cousins to play when they steal my phone.  They seemed to enjoy playing it :)  No complaints.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is very engaging and fun. Just wish it was longer. Great game to keep you interested for a long time.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Downloaded for my cousins to play when they steal my phone.  They seemed to enjoy playing it :)  No complaints.
B00000HZH7|4.0|If this has been remastered because I found a burned copy of it that I had in my collection and some of the songs on it seemed to be buried in the mix and the vocals were sounding as if they had been recorded either in a bathroom or a very airy sounding warehouse because they were buried in the mix, so can anyone let me know if the vocals have been improved upon. I don't know what happened to the original, I guess it got lost somewhere but I've been wanting to buy a new copy of it. I'm wearing the Possessed Seven Churches t-shirt right now and I'm 50 years old but love the s*** out of some of this old thrash. - Exhorder is another great thrash band of the old school variety.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I was addicted to this for a while.  Good puzzles, good graphics, good challenges.  I would recommend it to people.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A true &#34;coming of age&#34; story. Light and easy to read.  Something I've always wanted to do. Definitely one to read if you enjoy outdoorsy true adventure stories. Found it hard to put down...

B003Q6D2BE|5.0|a very enjoyable film everybody clicks they make the action so realistic their zimmers never once clash such professionals thumbs up for this movie i hope the sequal is as good.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|Rented this movie, trailer looked good.  Disclaimer - I like to mock movies, if this is fun for you then that may be where the five star reviews are coming from.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is hard to buy as an action star at his age.  People in the movie are continually doing things that make no sense, kind of like the people who run upstairs in the horror movies.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot, you will constantly be asking yourself \\"How did the bad guys get into their superior position when they can't think of the simplest way to solve problems?\\"<br /><br />+5000 to comments about a poor script, not a bad idea for a movie but just so very very bad plot execution.<br /><br />If you must, please please please only rent this forgettable catastrophe.
B009MO5960|4.0|i didn't enjoy this as much as the other films in the series the story is missing something the body count is many as usual
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We received our Chromecast a few weeks ago and have really enjoyed testing it out.  It was fairly easy to set up but be aware that phones and browsers on computers need to download a Chromecast extension, which is not mentioned anywhere in the installation guides.  Set up is otherwise fairly easy if you know that tidbit.<br /><br />Thus far, YouTube has been the easiest to stream.  It decreases your reliance on a cell phone and the image quality is great.  We tried streaming from Chrome browser and with a laptop using wifi, we experienced a substantial amount of lagging to the point we though it was unwatchable.  From a computer using an ethernet cable, that lag time was a non-issue.  With so many TV shows doing online shows, I think this is going to be great.<br /><br />We recently received our free 3-month NetFlix code.  We anticipate that's going to be MEGA.  We've tried streaming Amazon Prime videos but that has been unsuccessful as it appears Amazon has blocked Chromecast.<br /><br />For $35, it has a lot of practical value and even if it doesn't, it's not that expensive of a toy.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|a great brother and sister act,loads of action,the witches are so beautiful i'm in love.great special effects i don't want to spoil it for you so put your fingers in your ears and keep reading well it happened one day i can't type too well with my nose ahchoo.
B009NH6AOQ|3.0|there were many great episodes in season 3 and many slow episodes, the 3rd season seemed to loose its momentum here and there. I have not bought this from Amazon yet because I just don't think the price has come down low enough for a season as mediocre as this one was, and when I do buy it, I may just skip over watching certain episodes.<br />Andrew Lincoln is one of the greatest new actors I've seen in years and the rest of the cast that are still alive are almost as good.<br />I hate to be another one of the complainers but I thought the season finale was terrible, the episode with Merle and Michonne was fantastic. The season was just too inconsistent, and when you have to wait a week to see 45 minutes  worth of your favorite T.V. series, it's a let down if an episode just seems to be filler to get to the next episode which is another 7 day wait for another 45 minutes worth of material.<br />I'll never stop watching this show until they take it off the air but I'm hoping the new show runner Scott Gimple who wrote some of the best episodes in season 3 will correct these problems.<br />I've seen the season 4 previews and it looks like this season will be the best yet.<br /> The walkers are going to become much more aggressive as they starve and decompose and theirs going to be some kind of new threat from the new group of people within the prison, also no one knows what the hell happened to the governor, though he's not of much interest to me in this show, good actor though and seems to be a nice guy when interviewed.<br />Can't wait for season 4!<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!

B0089XH38M|1.0|did not like. so i removed it from my tablet. why do i have to write 10 more words to say that i don't like it.???
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Even though this book did not have the fast paced action of the first three, it was heavy on character exposition and rich in details. This is exactly what I loved about this book and many people complained about the lack of action and the slow moving story. But there is still a great story to tell and worth reading about. Frankly after main characters were killed off in books one through three, it was time to pause and introduce new characters in the world of westeros. So to me it made a lot of sense that the author took this route in the arc of the story and expounded on the iron born and the people of dorne. I am completely enthralled with this story and the fantasy world which the author so richly and deftly describes. It feels very real and almost like you are reading historical fiction. On to book five!!!
B004478AS4|4.0|This book made me laugh, cry, and nearly throw fits of rage. I have to read lots of books for the summer, but I was glad to read this. However, there were a few misspellings, such as \\"fu-fu\\" being spelled \\"foo-foo\\" all in all, a wonderful read. Much better than another book I am forced to slog my way regretfully through, \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\".
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I love this game but last time I got these games I have fun with them for a while but then I get board with the game bit I still love the game :{)
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It was different... kept me wanting more, lots of action. All the \\"you'll find out\\" & \\"stop asking questions\\" wasn't as bad  as allot of ppl said it was, at least not for me... looking forward to the next one :-)
B00COCY67A|3.0|Not impressed with the sound. I have never cared for the dull original mixes of this material. Some of the outtakes sound pretty good, but Elvis' outtakes ALWAYS sound better than the masters because they are not doctored up for AM radio and public consumption. For my money I would rather have 1999s Promised Land expanded and Essential Elvis Vol 5 Rhythm And Country. The mixing and mastering on those two CDs kick ass!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Definitely a nice app for 99&cent; Always spot on with my battery temp, speed and remaining life. 5 stars for sure

I though yepy!!!! candy cursh so after I down loaded it on to my kindel of corse I opened it I must have reed the label wrongs because it wasn't I'm so freakin angry about this so called &quot;game&quot;
B00COCY67A|5.0|Why I love Elvis and a need to buy this?:<br /><br />I'm a Big Elvis fan for many years now, since I was 7 (just a little bit before he left us) I saw the 1973 Hawaiian special rerun and that got me hooked!  Funny how that works ?  It's the same principal as the movie \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" no one understands unless you get shined on by that alien light and gives you a artificial red tan (or maybe not so artificial, anyways) and you get this uncontrollable urge to visit the alien landing site OR to love Elvis. For example, In the med 80's in Los Angeles (not the deep south) Elvis even influenced my marriage to my future lovely wife, unbeknownst to me, she was a huge Elvis fan and of course I fell in love with her at first sight and dedicated word for word in a letter the song \\"I want you, I need you and love you.\\"  She felt it was odd since almost no one our age liked Elvis. That got me to first base and a deep conversation on how Elvis affected our lives!  That produced a 5 year courtship and a blissful 24 year marriage and the rest is history. There are so many other reasons why I love Elvis!  His legacy is so amazing and sad, that it can literally touch the hearts of everyone in some way or fashion, but that is the magical unicorn or mythical dragon that is Elvis!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great song selection for those who love 70's Elvis, especially the out-takes.<br />2. Has a good not great - 42-page booklet with some photos, plus notes by Roger Semon and Robert Gordon on Stax sessions.<br />3. Hay - It's Elvis!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Not so very flattering album cover - they could of done better!  Plus, the CD's needs to be encased better.<br /><br />All in all good buy and the other positive reviewers got it right!

B0090SI582|4.0|When I first heard of plans to release another standalone Wolverine film, my initial reaction was why? X-Men Origins: Wolverine mostly mangled the mythology of its characters and, though Hugh Jackman carried the film well, it was ultimately a clunky, second-rate experience with one of the fakest looking final fights I've seen in a modern blockbuster (see Wolverine's battle with Deadpool, or don't for that matter). Furthermore, though it included a priceless cameo by Jackman, the fantastic X-Men: First Class seemed to take the franchise in a bit of a different direction. As a result, I was thoroughly surprised by the return to a solo Wolverine venture for the series' next outing. That being said, The Wolverine (they seem to be taking hints from The Fast and the Furious franchise with these titles... next up: Wolverine!) is for the most part the film Origins should have been. Smartly, The Wolverine tackles the title character almost exclusively, learning from the mistakes of Origins and limiting the number of other mutants to a select few. Though we get a few flashbacks here and there, this is also not an origin story, instead following Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to Japan after he is summoned by the dying CEO of a major tech corporation (Hal Yamanouchi), whom he saved from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Quickly, Wolverine becomes embroiled in the family's power struggle and must go on the run with the CEO's daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from Yakuka thugs and the viciously seductive mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova).<br /><br />  Solid performances all around ground The Wolverine, particularly from Jackman in all of his vascular glory, Okamoto, and Fukushima, who plays the expert swordswoman Yukio (almost needlessly turned into a mutant for this outing). The only character I didn't really buy was that of Viper, who's basically Poison Ivy + shedding... she just wasn't that strong of a villain. On the other hand, James Mangold, director of great dramas like Walkthe Line and 3:10 to Yuma, has a fantastic grip on the dramatic side of the film, imbuing it with a sense of reality and a dark edge. Furthermore, the action sequences are pretty impressive. Though the film didn't end up with the R-rating it was on the verge of getting, Wolverine's numerous encounters with sword-toting ninjas and Yakuza thugs make for tense, visceral, and incredibly staged action sequences. Wolverine's loss of his regenerative capabilities, something that could have gone awry if handled incorrectly, only ups the stakes during these sequences.<br /><br />  What's also great is that The Wolverine is an almost entirely self-contained story, taking the character to a new environment with new characters. That being said, though, The Wolverine doesn't ignore what's come before it. Since brooding anti-hero is the new cool, Wolverine struggles with more than a few of his own demons. Effectively, anyone who's ever meant anything to him is gone at the close of X-Men: The Last Stand, so Logan is haunted by visions of Jean Grey and tortured by the events of The Last Stand. As are we all. A fanboy geek-out moment after the end credits also ties the The Wolverine into X-Men: Days of Future Past., so be sure to stick around for it. Though suffering from the usual plot-holes, The Wolverine is still miles better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine and functions well as a nice, focused solo outing to placate the ravenous fan in you eagerly awaiting Days of Future Past. I can only wonder, though, what the brilliant Darren Aronofsky would have done with this film had he stayed on to direct.<br /><br />See it:  If you have any affinity for the Wolverine character or the X-Men franchise as a whole, for The Wolverine is a worthy addition to that cinematic canon and a thrilling bit of summer fun, albeit one that lacks a particularly strong central villain and climax.<br /><br />Pass:  If sharp objects and bone claws aren't your thing, or if you're a staunch conservative when itcomes to how Hollywood adapts your favorite, comic book story-lines.<br /><br />Go to moviemusicmania . com for more great film and film score reviews! Happy viewing!

B008JFUO4U|4.0|I missed seeing this movie in the theater where it would have been the best viewed but the blu-ray is stunning. If you are into sci-fi, you will enjoy this movie. Also, if you are a Tom Cruise fan, you will love it as he dominates the screen throughout the movie. The story is good, the acting very good, and the cinematography and music is outstanding.<br />As we enter the digital age, we may see the end of blu-ray, dvd, etc but if Hollywood wants to continue to sell physical medium, then this is how you sell a product. The blu-ray menu is nice, the features very good but what makes this blu-ray standout is the isolated soundtrack. I love that feature and I have only one other movie like this which was a dvd. You won't get this with a digital copy. The movie studios should continue this and if they could bundle the soundtrack on CD with the movie and charge an extra $5.00, I think that would be a great idea. One of the Ghost In The Shell movies came bundled with the soundtrack CD and I was impressed. This movie is diffiently worth the current $20.00 price.

B00CFA222M|4.0|From the opening scene,a young boy begging his father for a bedtime story to the pleasingly surprise ending, Bryan Singer has magically transformed the telling of \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" into an incredible cinematic adventure with all the action and thrills imaginable! Utilizing today's CGI (ingeniously but not too overdone), good old fashioned acting (believable dialogue laced with humorous reparte between the characters, void of the tiresome clich&eacute;s)lavish costumes, believable locales and sets, and an ensemble of fresh new faces (Nicholas Hoult as Jack, Eleanor Tomlinson as the Princess) we are taken back to a time of Kings, Castles and the myth of a banished race, the Giants ......the story does not stray too far from its original telling but focuses on those elements that beckon the return of these gargantuan creatures (each so grotesque in their appearance and evil in their intentions, masterfully portrayed in this story) and the Fairytale romance between a Princess and a commoner, the Farmer's son.  The Beanstalk itself, a spectacular design of special effects, is an unbelievable enormous growth of twisted, tortuous, twining tentacles that ascends from one magic bean- growing upwards into the clouds as the portal into the land of the Giants. Here we see a hierarchy within the Giant culture...a simmering conflict between the two headed (ingenious!) leader and his rival who desires to be King of the cretins.  There is a clever use of overlapping dialogue that stitches one scene to another into brilliant, believable conversations and surprises! Subtle colors, candlelit interior scenes add to the frightening and ominous events that occur thruout this spectacular film....the action scenes almost rule the film but for the Actors (the King, regally played by Ian McShane-what a scene stealer! the Protector, Ewan Macgregor-dashing, fearless and a potential suitor for the princess, the General-monacled and reminiscent of a German Kaiser in uniform and demeanor;and, of course, the Giants themselves-each markedly different in appearance and mentality with just enough humor to allow viewing by younger audiences) Oh yes, there is somewhat of a surprise ending with a twist provided by Mr. Singer-- remember the evil Lord Roderick? I was thoroughly entertained and treated to feast of deliciously devilish villians, creatures and a believable plot.....you need to experience this wonderful film....how about this weekend?  Perhaps a gathering of pillows on the floor, a large bowl of popcorn, all the kids and SHHHHHHH! the movie's starting........
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read through all of these, and I followed Katniss' tale from the beginning. There was no better way to end this book, and if you decide to read it, you will not be disappointed.
B000I186FW|1.0|V for Vendetta is about the idea that bravery will bring down a dictatorship. It tries to demonstrate this with four plots. The main plot is about the revolution to overthrow the fascist government, which succeeds. This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore. Society's rise to arms is demonstrated by two internal plots: that of Evey's growing bravery to the point of being willing to die to protect her freedom and that of the inspector general refusing to carry out orders for an oppressive government. Evey's arc is also accompanied by her growing love for V.<br /><br />The story ends with society taking up V's call to arms and marching on parliament to overthrow the government.<br /><br />The movie has numerous references to Nazi Germany and tries to make a point that revenge for its own sake is not the end goal, rather, overcoming fear to stand up for what's right is paramount. This is highlighted by the ending whereby V does not blow up the parliament on his own but leaves it to the people.<br /><br />It's a great idea.<br /><br />But the movie didn't work for me. Mostly because the beginning raised the stakes so much that the turning points leading to the end felt inconsequential or unbelievable. We go from the first 10 minutes where:<br /><br />Evey goes on a date past curfew, whereby she is:<br />Harassed by the police with threat of rape, whereby:<br />V saves her by beating the police up, V goes onto blow up the courts<br />From there, the movie gets to work to lay out each of the plots. The problem for me is the first 10 minutes setup a world where hyperbole rules. This fantastical setup presents an extreme world that makes the rest of the movie's twists and turns hard to believe since the beginning setup two omniscient parties: the government and V.<br /><br />Great idea, just didn't work for me.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I've had this app for a few months now.  I do enjoy using it to play music.  I never was too pleased with iTunes, this is a bit better IMHO.<br /><br />I have about 7,600 songs in my library.  I've downloaded about half to my phone.  When I try to shuffle that, it blows up the app and force-closes on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  It seems that it cannot handle the shuffle of that many songs.  This is a big bummer and my primary complaint with the app.<br /><br />The other thing that bugs me is that it seems to be missing the ability to add songs to playlists at various parts of the application.  For example - if you're playing a song, you can't add it to a playlist from that point.
B007Z58RLC|5.0|This novel is akin to a journey without direction, destination or mode of transportation.  For those who seek to find- you shall be most disappointed for there will be nothing for you to find here, but for those who do not seek, this book will provide everything you could hope to find in a mental stimulation medium such as this.  My advice for those who wish to truly enjoy this, go into it like Harry Potter entered the chamber of secrets, don't &#34;expect&#34; to get anything out of it and you will find that this work is far more rewarding than you can know.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|MINI-REVIEW: there's a lot of action scenes in this flick as adult badass versions of Hansel and Gretel go after not just witches but a coven upon coven of witches. The dialogue is a bit modern to relate to modern audiences but whatever. Barring a few plotholes this is an above average tale with good to very good special effects, action and colorful costumes. Starring Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton. Some of the minor witches were the most memorable characters. Based on Grimm's \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" with a ton of liberties but still good enough fun. OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: B.<br /><br />SPOILER: so Hansel has this injection he has to take every few hours or he will die and yet he gets caught up in a tree and knocked out. Assuming he wasn't up in the tree that long why was this even in the tale? Methinks it was from an earlier draft and somebody thought it would be cool even though there was no payoff.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|The first 2 movies in this blu-ray set has to be the gold standard on how to transfer movies to blu-ray.This was a steal for $20 although the 3rd and 4th movie are absolute crap.The blu-ray transfer on the first 2 movies (Alien and Aliens) is stupendous. You know that the transfer has been done meticulously when you see the dark portions of the movie. Especially in aliens when they are moving in the dark with their mounted flash lights. Deducted a point because Alien 3 got stuck in a few places .I had to reset the blu-ray player and skip the portions where it got stuck and would not play. ALIEN Resurrection played well though.Buy it just for the first 2 .The classics have become classier :-)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|3.5 stars if I could...I had heard many things about this book....I didn't think that it was badly written and enjoyed the emails/texts between the main characters...it was a very good summer read and I am disappointed to come to the end as I feel invested in both characters...

B001QWBM62|5.0|I really love this handheld, and we use it extensively for capturing audio for film projects. We did run into a catastrophic situation with audio failure that we have now attributed to the use of an incompatible SDHC card. In my research, I stumbled across this site:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Someone else apparently experienced the error that the audio was irretrievable. There is a list of tested and approved SD/SDHC cards within that blog, however it is sorely outdated (2009). At this point, I don't know which card we used that contained the irretrievable audio.<br /><br />We will stick with the Zoom H4n and limit our SD/SDHC selection to only the cards included on the old list. If anyone has access to an updated list, please post it!

B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I thought this was a good movie, to me it was similar to the Matrix with some Tom Cruise spin to it. IT had a good balance of action, it kept my attention. I would recommend it to those who are into SciFi like movies. I bought it to watch on a train ride, viewed it on a Kindle, didnt kill my battery watching it.

B00D3LA5WG|4.0|While I wouldn't call this film \\"An American Classic\\" like one critic said, I did feel that it was worth watching. The storyline was interesting right off the bat, and kept me invested until the end of the movie. Yes, Matthew M. does give a strong, nuanced performance, but the young teen boys are the ACTUAL stars of the film. The emotional range they portray is impressive for such young actors, and I believe they each have a long acting career ahead of them! The one puzzling aspect of the film to me was why Reese Witherspoon took the part of Mud's ex-girlfriend? The script gave her absolutely nothing to do but stand around with a \\"hangdog\\" look. Mostly I felt that this film was worth watching, because it is such a great portrait of how some people are chaos-junkies and create endless drama for themselves and others. All of Mud and Juniper's problems were brought on by themselves. (Don't we ALL know people who can't seem to keep the negative drama out of their lives?) I found myself liking Matthew M.'s character in spite of the fact that I had no sympathy for him and his manipulations.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is obviously a woman that I would love to have as a friend. She is intelligent and over the top amusing. I already have enough great female friends, but in her case, I would make an exception and welcome her into our circle (if she'd have us!)<br />The book is incredible because it sheds light on what I believe to be her true character, self deprecating yet self accepting at the same time. Love that. I feel exactly the same  way. Of course, she is famous and that makes the self-deprecating part all the more exceptional.<br />I only wish that the book hadn't ended so quickly. I hadn't had my fill of getting to know Tina Fey.
B002NS2HBM|5.0|Dang, this show is entertaining. Thrills, chills and Jennifer Garner in high heels. My favorite part of each episode was seeing Sydney Bristow's latest disguise. It's uncanny how Jennifer Garner looks good in every conceivable haircolor and bizarre outfit! Victor Garber is wonderful as the humorless Jack Bristow, while Lena Olin is mesmerizing as a Russian spy- (even though the constant slurring of her S's drove me nuts). I think the cutest character of all would have to be Marshall Flinkman, the bumbling and socially inept genius. His drum solo marriage proposal had my daughters and I rolling with laughter! \\"Carrie....we had SUSHI\\". The \\"Rambaldi\\" storyline gets a bit old, but the writers did a good job of weaving the story throughout the seasons. This show makes you want to become a spy!
B000TSIK14|4.0|This release is very solid. The production is top notch and as close to perfection as you can get. I have to admit I did not like this on first listen as it does have a more modern sound that takes some getting used to. By the second time through I was completely hooked!! What the Scorpions have achieved is the closest thing in my mind to The Uli Roth days with a super modern sound. Sort of a cross between both Scorpions eras and some of the most unique and addictive songs they have ever released. The hooks and melodies here are inspiring and Klaus sounds better than ever! Excellent songs include: Hour 1, The Game of Life, We Were Born to Fly, The Future Never Dies, We Will Rise Again, The Cross, and Humanity. The last CD from the Scorpions I had purchased before this was Crazy World.<br /><br />Now for a few negatives, I did edit my original review from 5 stars to 3.5 (rounded up) for a few reasons. There definitely are some filler songs here so I cannot say the entire album is perfect. While the new sound is interesting I could not help but wonder what this would have been if they had really extended much of the guitar solo work. The chorus repetition is also a little on the heavy side. It is still catchy as hell and sounds great but it is one step off of perfection and missing the old time rawness and creativeness of the the 70's Scorps. This is still the best modern era release for them as it blows away Sting In The Tail (which was horrible!) and it is clearly better than Unbreakable.

B002BWQ6H6|4.0|Reading this novel was like looking at a masterpiece painting. The language was beautiful and depicted characters that you loved and those that you didn't like so much, but wanted to keep reading anyway. The story of all of these diverse lives woven together with the impact of a moment. I will keep reading this author.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because, although it was beatifully written, I've read books that I like better. So, 5 stars for technical and 4 stars for story.

B0084IG8TM|3.0|I liked this movie.  I loved the book.  While the movie parallels the book, and doesn't leave anything out, the book is told from Katniss' point of view, whereas the movie is told from an onlookers perspective.  This takes away from the movie, somewhat, as in the movie you don't know what is going on, the inner torment that Katniss is dealing with, regarding Peeta, killing in the Games, Prim, Gale, and her father...  Therefore, it is miles behind the book.

0439023513|5.0|The only thing that I didn't like about this book was that it ended an incredible series.  The characters that you've learned to love from The Hunger Games through Catching Fire, only make you feel more for them and fall even more in love with them in this book.  This book is incredible, I only wish that it was longer, because when it was over so was this series...  Suzanne Collins, please write more.

Catching Fire picked up right where The Hunger Games left off, filling in all of the missing pieces.  The biggest thing I can tell anyone who reads this book is that they should have the 3rd book on hand because you WILL HAVE TO read Mockingjay immediately after.  Suzanne Collins is an amazing talent.

B00BWWS81S|5.0|What a difference there is between this album and the last one, which is like a thick soup that gets boringly overwhelming after the third sip. KT Tunstall has finally found her \\"voice,\\" I think, with this album. The sound is consistently spectacular: a bit of Nora Jones mixed with instrumental experimentation, the kind you see in Hilary Hahn and Hauschka's album Silfra for example. KT is not playing with strange instruments, of course, but you can feel the keen attention she pays to every single sound she and each instrument produce together. I give this album 5 stars because it's so beautifully done. I'm surprised by KT's ability to keep being creative after all these years without being completely washed out by the industry. However, I do think there's more room for growth. I still want to see that honesty that is so clear in her first album: the innocent boldness that is the advantage of not having expectations to be aware of. That being said, she's making very good music in this album and should be commended.

B00CUIVGZS|4.0|Much to my own regret I had long ago stopped following Chick Corea's career with all that much vigor. It had nothing to do with any lack of appreciation for the technically and fluidically gifted musician himself. But because of the fact his musical journey seemed to be going around in circles somehow. Aware as I am of fusion being a more neglected musical genre than a lot of people might think, Corea has basically maintained that style since starting Return To Forever. His new band includes sax player Tim Garland,guitarist Chares Altura,bassist Hadrien Feraud and drummer Marcus Gilmore-with percussionist Pernell Saturnino joining in as well for this assumed musical rebirth.<br /><br />  \\"Galaxy 32 Star 4\\" opens the album with probably my personal favorite number on it-a tune filled with some strong rhythmic exchanges and Corea's trademark gentle melodic flamboyance on the electric piano. The spacious \\"Planet Chia\\" and the soulful groove of \\"Portals To Forever\\" are not far behind it-with Garland letting go on some spirited sax solos throughout. \\"Royalty\\" is actually another favorite of mine-a swinging affair that finds  Gilmore and Hadrien on some slippery bass/drum interactions. \\"Outside Of Space\\" is the sole vocal piece,featuring Gayle Moran of course and very typical of the kind of tune she and husband Chick Corea do together.<br /><br />  Featuring Ravi Coltrane's sax and old hand Stanley Clarke \\"Pledge For Peace\\" is an easy standout to me. Its full of the rhythmic and melodic meditations and spirituality that characterized John Coltrane's best work. Its clear his son has more than the talent to realize this in his own right.  \\"Legacy\\" ends the album in the instrumentally collective melodic fusion that began the album and,as a result on a very strong not. While an instrumentally flawless and very impressive album for a group of people who are just starting to play together,the few flaws of this album lay with Corea himself. There's a mild sameness and lack of memorability in his compositions here.  While musically this album strongly celebrates instrumental imagination as its intended, the compositions don't always live up to their strengths. In the end this album serves to remind me of both the positive and negative side of Chick Corea's talents.morability in his compositions here.

All their CD's (The Way of The Fist, War Is The Answer, American Capitalist & Wrong Side of Heaven...) are outstanding. FFDP will rock you on all levels of Metal, Rock and everything else in between. This CD will give you a taste of Metal that will keep you coming back for more. Remember to Dot your Eyes and Cross your teeth. Thank you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great series from PBS.  I would recommend it to anyone, but make sure you start with Season 1!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I couldn't put it down, from the moment I read the sample, until I finished the full book. It provided me with a compassionate view of the author's fellow inmates and really got me wondering about the purpose of incarceration for many offenders.<br /><br /> After reading the book I watched the Netflix series, which I admit I enjoyed, in a different way. The book feels more realistic, with situations that are not taken to dramatic extremes and much more introspection.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I thought it was going to be a five star movie considering Alex Jones called it an Illuminati tour de force.  It is true that is the potential we face in the future (and now):  government deception and a war on humans and terra farming a planet for resources.  I and others liked the film, but something was missing.  Something I can't put my finger on.  So, I'll give it four stars.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game. Play everyday. Are there more levels? Are there other ways to get coins other than spending real money?
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The game has nice graphics and enjoyable gameplay. Recommend if you have some spare time. The puzzles can be repeatative sometimes but this game offers some hours iota enjoyment.
B00CA4S37G|5.0|Well done remastering of a classic zappa record. A must have for those of you who have worn out your old record and want a new replacement. was delivered fast too!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is a really good book so far. I decided to read it after i watched the series on Netflix's.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Except I deleted something that one of my games was using and have to start over. Other than that I am most happy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book made me love, hate and cry for the main characters all I the same book.  Well written story, heartbreaking and lovely all in the same book.
0790731509|5.0|this was a gift for my husband.  he loves this movie and i am very glad i could find it there.  thanks.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|A very interesting approach to telling the story of Jack and the Bean Stalk.  I would definitely watch it again.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|thanks this game has given my granddaughter lots of fun.  she loves it and has gotten me to play it with her.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is such a fun game I played it for like<br />Five minutes then rated it and going in<br />The time machine is awesome if I could rate<br />Six stars I would
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|Bought this for the wife's D5100.  She hasn't shown me any videos she's shot with this mic attached, so I can't comment on sound quality, but she is really excited about having it so I have to give it 4 stars.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|This game offers a lot of flexibility and plenty of challenge.  It takes a little getting used to, but once you get familiar with the conventions of the game, it's a lot of fun.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It had the perfect balance of action, fantasy, and suspense. I cant wait to read the sequel.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the overall concept of this app, its got everything i usually need to find. But its sssooooo glitchy, it hangs and crashes all the time. I keep looking for updates where it will be fixed but it only seems to get worse. I like the press and hold to pin things, that is quite handy. It even had this section that would show you the boards most recently pinned to. This new version crashes when i try to pin things andthe sorting thing doesnt work properly
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|trailer basically gave the whole story away...along with all the witty lines.  I had such high hopes for this movie but ended up just leaving it on in the background since all the good lines were already in the extended trailers....<br /><br />such a disappointment!
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel after picking it up from a second hand book store for under 5$. Since then I have read it, alongside lirael and abhorsen, multiple times. The perfect characters, alongside the absolute evil in the kingdom, sabriel is never your classic good vs evil story line. Garth Nix does an absolute amazing job of letting the reader relate with the characters and takes you on a journey that i will always remember.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is an  brilliantly written action packed novel that I could not take my eyes off  of .
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. I love playing games like Battlefield 3, C&C and Deadspace. I bought this mouse on impulse and am glad I did, the software that comes with the mouse makes it incredibly customizeable. I have four different settings saved and can change to any one I want with the simple click of a button. The color options are really cool too along with the adjustable weights given.<br />Lastly, I bought this mouse 6 months ago and am just now writing the review. It hasn't hiccuped once. Very good buy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for all ages and I'm 13 and I think it's fun. There are games similar to this but those aren't as fun as despicable me minion rush. I get board a lot with the other apps, when I saw this app I knew I would love it ,and I do, because I love the despicable me movies 1 and 2. It's an awesome time waster! F you don't get it I might cry!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome app! I love it. Super fun and keeps me entertained. Can be challenging at some times, but hey, that's why it's so fun.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It came in protective packaging and it was in great condition and i love how it has a dvd and blur ray inside
B005LLSZNM|5.0|My wife an I are addicted!! All the characters are kick a**!  So stoked to see what's gonna happen in the 6th season!!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Not quite the page-turner as the first book but still really good - definitely worth the time to read it
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This story deals with two women, Amanda, a Hollywood producer (Cameron Diaz), and Iris, an English journalist (Kate Winslet), who stay in each other's home for the holiday season.  As each adjusts to her new environment, they meet new men as well.  Amanda meets Iris' brother, Graham (Jude Law), and Iris meets Amanda's friend, Miles (Jack Black playing a normal person, for a change).  The relationships deepen till each woman is faced with a choice: take things further or just go back home.<br /><br />I found this film better than your average rom-com.  The movie was funny.  The cast and acting were good.  The writing deserved better than to be dismissed as &#34;chick-flick.&#34;
B0047S1KMS|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice. very scary! rare
B008I34ZFW|5.0|A brilliant send-up of the insidious nature of politics.  The cast, actiing and story were great.  I recommend this film to anyone.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|this is very decent movie one of the better types, great to watch, good to have as many types of movies as possable.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I never bothered seeing this film at the theatre.  I am glad I watched this DVD.  The plot was more complex than I initially gave it credit for.  The casting and acting were top-notch.  It is one of the few films I have seen that made smartness sexy.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|this is very good movie one of the better types, great to watch, good to have as many types of movies as possable.
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|My 4 year old daughter really liked this.<br /><br />But there is a LOT OF WEIRD things going on in this movie.  At the end SATAN appears, and the human ponys grow wings and tails and no one seems to notice.<br /><br />The worst part is the forced love interest from Twilight Sparkle towards Edward Cullen, totally unnecessary and pointless and out of character.<br /><br />Rainbow dash is very much a jock, rainbow power girl.
B005LAIH54|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I loved the format that you used to use. This new format isn't easy to look at and tell the weather's feels like, rain percent, and extended forecast
B002TZS5GU|3.0|this is ok not awfull or anything but cheap and a good watch, good to have as many zombie type movies as possable.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate the new upgrade! Hard to see through all the &quot;stuff&quot; on the screen and not easy to use. I will be uninstalling it.

B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I loved it. They definitely did an amazing job in getting really good actors, and then matching them to the role that they could be best at.
B004LWZW24|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Love The Shield. Great actors, acting & writing. Could watch over and over. Not your normal cop show, like all the others on tv.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great true story, great acting. I love it when they make movies out of declassified government documents, or little know stories from our past. Would definitely rewatch.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! its one of the top possession movies out.
0345529057|5.0|If you like to take and adventure into your imagination and read, then this is a book for you. Sucks you rite in and will not let you go once you start. I couldn't put it down. Great story with twists and turns that are obvious, but when the time comes it's like you never say it conning. Love it. Recommend to anyone.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Considering the types of movies that Tom Cruise sometimes chooses, that it was nice to see him do a movie that isn't what he normally would do.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There should be more updates like making red stone work and make hunger bars if they can add villages and wolf's that would be great but an epic game

0307949486|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson is a crime thriller masterpiece.<br /><br />  The story follows Mikael Blomkvist an investigative financial journalist whom works for a newspaper company. After he receives a sentence of libel for publishing a scandalous story he receives a strange offer from a prominent Swedish family to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vengar, one of the heirs to the family's company, whom had disappeared over 40 years ago. The story also follows Lisbeth Salander an investigator who is a genius but is a social outcast, appearing from the outside to fit in more with a group of anarchists than the stuffy corporate world.<br /><br />  The novel is written in such living and breathing detail and grips you from beginning to end that you will find it hard to put down. The book does a fantastic job of leaving you guessing what will happen next. It takes you along for a thrilling roller coaster ride, but be forewarned the book pulls no punches. At times I found it difficult to continue reading due to the graphic nature of some events in the book. However those who can make it through are rewarded by a story rich in characters and mystery.<br /><br />  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys thrillers, mysteries, amazing character stories, or just to try something new that is very original.
B0053FANT0|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|Having piloted the real thing, I find the flight dynamics realistic and the graphics outstanding (as much as they can be on a Kindle).  For a free application of this type, I think it would be hard to find much better. I love the features, particularly the replay video and the change of view angle &amp; zoom. That's quite a bit to pack into such a small app.<br /><br />What's not perfect? Controls are a little sluggish but given all the stuff going on, I can live with it. Also, those looking for an arcade action game won't find it here. This is definitely in the &quot;simulation&quot; category.  Nice work.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! at least twice.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!! Great story of redemption, finding and accepting love and self worth. I enjoyed so much learning about the meaning of flowers and was surprised by some of the meanings of flowers that love. The dictionary at the end is great and will be used!!!
B0053TWVDC|5.0|the original and best of all the children of the corn movies, this ones a must have, i love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The games really fun just wish that it had the free coins for watching videos like the IPad version has other than that love it
B002ZG980U|5.0|this is very good movie one of the better types, great to watch, good to have as many types of movies as possable. very rare and awsome!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Keeping the franchise alive with this sequel and definitely making it better than the second.  A good concept for the storyline and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are still great together.  Check it out.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This is one of the really cool puzzle games. My one problem is that i cant get any more pearls. I have one more puzzle to finish the game and i just solve this one. All i need is one more pearl but i have no idea how to get one. If the pearls were a more frequent reward this would be a 5 stars.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Keeping the Indiana Jones movies going with this sequel might have been a stretch.  From finding Godly relics to aliens, not sure this was the right direction.  The storyline is good but the action scenes make for good entertainment.  Good idea with bringing in past faces but just not digging the alien story.
B002ZG994U|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Full of action and I love Liam Nieson movies anyway. Love this movie!
B0082Z447U|5.0|In my opinion, &#34;The Women In White&#34; was a great mystery novel, one of the earliest of the genre. I came across the name of the 19th century author Wilkie Collins when another of his novels, &#34;The Moonstone&#34; made a recent &#34;Top 100 Books&#34; list, I decided to take a flyer (in both Kindle & Audible formats!) on that one, along with this other of his once runaway best selling novels. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />I found the book to be extremely well-written, with an intricately planned out, frequently suspenseful, airtight mystery, and full of interesting, well-defined characters. Marian Holcombe, Laura Fairlie, Walter Hartright, Anne Catherick and Sir Percival Glyde were among the major characters, and their stories were very engrossing and compelling. Other lesser, but no less interesting, characters bolster the story and add to the suspense. But two characters who stood out most for me were Frederick Fairlie, the inimitable master of the Limmeridge House and the larger-than-life Count Fosco, whose actions drive much of the mysterious doings right up to the very end. I found myself absorbed in the tale, trying to identify who was friend of the protagonists and who was foe and attempting to guess where the well-constructed mystery was going next. And I was never disappointed.<br /><br />One thing I do think worth noting for potential readers is in regard to Collins' writing style. As is typical of the era, the writing is full of the Victorian love of detail, minute observations, and elaborate literary flourishes. (A print copy of the book would clock in at over 700 pages!). His is almost the complete opposite of the sparse, bare-bones style that the work of writers like Hemingway have made us accustomed to today. (It seems to me that Collins says nothing in 10 words that he can't say in 30!) So I do include that caveat to those who may prefer quick read done in a modern, fast-paced style; this novel requires some patience. And fwiw, along the lines of eras and styles; with the story being set in 1850 England, &#34;The Woman In White&#34; also provided me with a detailed glimpse of those times, how people lived and how that society thought, something I personally always find interesting and enlightening!<br /><br />In conclusion; for me, &#34;The Women In White&#34; very worthwhile experience.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I love this movie Comedy and love story all wrapped up in one! Great movie and great cast! I could watch it again.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I THINK THAT THIS IS TRULY A FANTASTIC IDEA. I USE  THIS APP ALL THE TIME..THE PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR  THE APP THANK YOU
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! It's fun and there is alwasys some challenge to finish whether it be the daily words or missions which makes it very addicting. Sometimes when the runner gets really fast my kindle somewhat glitches and freezes . It's not a huge problem, just annoying at times. I do prefer this game over Temple Run and other games of this nature. Overall, wonderful game.
B00DW475CC|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie after 'A Christmas Story' and I have to think about that,LOL!  Far superior to the remake. You just can mess with classic movies. That we've had to wait this long for the Blu-Ray version is a shame. I have it on my Wish List.
B00004RFFI|4.0|When I moved into a small town in Iowa and bought a house, I knew that legend had it that the entire town had been leveled in a tornado of the 1890's. I knew about tornadoes from The Wizard of Oz,  but I rather scoffed when I discovered that my porch was, in  fact, the reinforced concrete roof of a tornado shelter section of the basement. I remained skeptical until the first tornado that came our way. Seeing the first very ominous signs of the approaching storm, I joined my co-workers in walking to our nearby homes and getting into their shelters. (Iowa is on the more northerly path of those twisters coming up from Texas and Oklahoma.) Aside from reminding me of those days, this picture gives a good idea of what some of these look like and the damage they can do. On that score it is worth seeing. As for the accompanying love story, well, I guess they had to have something besides the storms. Its ancient, uninteresting, irrelevant and immaterial. She (HH) Loves Him and tornadoes, He Loves Ms. X and tornadoes, Ms. X Loves Him but Not tornadoes, He and Ms. X visit the tornado zone where HH, who is his current wife, is to have the divorce papers signed to dissolve their marriage so he can marry Ms. X, a tornado comes  on the scene...... Well,  figure it out for yourself.<br />The acting is competent, with a good cast limited by the needs of a storm-centered movie and the traditions of same. The script is unexceptional, the direction competent. The Tornadoes and what goes with them is what you are coming to see. If you have no desire to see such storms and the surrounding conventional stories, this is not the picture for you.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a good game. Really additive.  Just wish life would fill quicker. Not really fond of the dark scenes either.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|great family move would watch it  again. One of the best movies made. would be a good movie for familly night
B003O86FMW|5.0|Sad ending!!!!!!!!!!! I love this book it is very good for ages 10 and up not any younger please it is sad
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a good game its like temple run bet with minions and more Despicable ni perfor people to get this game its fun SO GEET THE GAME!!!....no presher
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Many thanks to all men and women who serve as they do it selflessly.  God Speed and God Bless.  K
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It seems like this app is more about the ads and the background image. The weather seems to be an afterthought.  It is slow to load even on fast network. You would expect more from the Weather Channel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is fun to get to the next levle and defeating vector and Mallissa's it is alsome over all baaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnaaaaaaaannnnnnaaaaaaaaa<br />I love bananas I love bananas
B0090P98Z4|5.0|it pretty gd since i just started  the first couple of bosses r easy it simple and fun and i really like it
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Surprisingly educational, fun, and the best game of its kind. My only negative is how long it takes for an update for new content (special diseases, etc.).
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|On trying to open this program, the game crashed before even getting to the main screen. I tried several more times and it crashed each time within seconds of opening it. I tried a force stop, which did nothing. I uninstalled, re-downloaded and reinstalled it, with the same result. Looks neat, but is not playable.<br />Samsung Galaxy 10.1
0307719774|5.0|I write in this book every day.  I keep it in a common spot in the house that I visit every day!! Asks a question, and I always have an answer to jot down.  It is a fun little book.  I really like it.  You will probably discover things about yourself you never thought about!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love the game! Only reason I gave this game four and not five stars is it could have used a demo level.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Use this app daily in my math centers. Students like the visual cues and large buttons as they compute and solve word problems. Appreciate ads are classroom friendly.
1401207529|3.0|I was disappointed how much recycled material is in this book.  If it was only meant to be a compilation, perhaps with refreshed art, I didn't catch that before buying it.  There's a sequence with a pre-Catwoman Selina Kyle that's ripped straight from a Catwoman graphic novel (which in turn may have been drawn from individual comics, I don't know; I'm not a comic expert by any stretch) with no art changed at all.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Heard about this album through Radio 6 and the BBC proms, it's amazing! And now she gets to play it with the LSO, can't wait!
B0000DJYPB|5.0|Purchased it as a birthday gift; my brother absolutely loved it! Got it for a great price and fast shipping too!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun game and simple concept.  It's entertaining to advance to the next level to see your arsenal of plants or newest zombie foes.  Visually, it's still pretty nice on a phone or tablet.  Highly recommend it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and challenging! My kids love it, too.  My 4 yr old can do the early boards, and I'm sick in the top ones.  Love it!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The acting was absolutely phenomenal.  I give the story maybe 4 stars because it was good but a bit slow moving at times.  But that doesn't diminish my praise for the movie and high recommendation you see it.
0064471837|5.0|I had lots of great memories of the Abhorsen trilogy, but I wasn't sure how they'd hold up as an adult. So often young adult SciFi/Fantasy that I enjoyed when I was a kid doesn't age well. When I listened to the books again recently though I was amazed. These books are just as incredible as I remember them, if not more so. When I worked in a bookstore a year ago, Sabriel was one of the few books I insisted on keeping stocked and would try to sell it to anyone looking around the YA section. I hope a new generation of kids reads these books, and I can't wait for \\"Clariel,\\" the long-awaited next book in the series.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been lifting for years, read dozens of reports, tried hundreds of routines.  The information in this book with out a doubt will change your mentality and help you gain muscle mass.  I wish I could have read this YEARS ago!
0553801473|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series and his book did not disappoint. It focuses on all the characters that are not heavily featured in Feast for crows and adds new characters. If you enjoyed the previous 4 books there is no reason not to get this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love Sylvia Day. Going to try to wait patiently for the next one!!!! Don't make us wait too long please!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't get a better free app. It's awesome. Bananarific!!!!! My girls love it! Kids and adults who want a laugh should play this game. We love minions!!!!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game is really fun you should get it but I wish that the dog would kill the zombies fast but it is really fun
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Downloaded it to my kindle fire and can't get it to work work tells me I don't have the correct operating system
0810996596|5.0|this book is amazing it has kirk in it and all of his collection and it has stuff ive never heard of and it has some of my favorite movie things like A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th i love it
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The game reminds me of skyrim and diablo :) the only thing i would change is the healing potions could be unlimited,not just three of them. Other than that, you should get it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read The kite runner and A thousand splendid suns. LOVED both of them. If you previously read his earlier works, just know that this one is different. It's not the same style. It makes you think, you have to concentrate, because he jumps back and forth in the timeline of events. Loved it. I just wish Khaled would write more often and produce two novels a year. I would buy them! (I read the kindle edition)
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like it but there was only one mini game I didn't like everything else was great the characters where a bit much I thing and I kinda wish it was a little longer.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like a lot about the new Weather Channel app. However I took a star off for complicated and what happened to seasonal pollen updates. If it's here that just adds to complicated.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|was expecting more of a storyline, and it was just basically videography.  Nice landscapes, and whatnot, but no real story.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I was very skeptical of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.  It just seemed like a very odd fit.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to see how well it turned out.  Great movie.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Found it a bit boring but still read the whole thing cause I love zombies. The movie didn't do a good job either lol
1933308087|5.0|This book will not disappoint. It is the most complete book of quilting block design and pattern choices for creative quilters ever compiled. I need ten lives to make all that I want to now :-)
B0067TQQI8|5.0|It is easy to use and I like it 👍<br />Thank you very much and I will order 2 more.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am looking forward to seeing what ties this series together with all the others.  Hoids role and etc....  hurry....
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is definitely a five star movie.  The dvd worked with no problem.  The movie is of course worth watching.  Even my husband who dislikes fantasy and science fiction movies enjoyed this movie.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I don't think this book is as good as his other two, but it was certainly worth reading and I would recommend it to anyone. I love the author's style of writing and is descriptive passages enable the reader to &#34;see&#34; what he is writing about.
0312965788|4.0|If you like James Herriot, you will like this book.  I liked his cat stories better.  This one was a little too long winded
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I wasn't super-thrilled for the first couple stages (levels), but once I was familiarized with the controls, I really loved it! Thanks for adding to my bubble game addiction.  :)
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|If you grew up in the 80's playing video games, playing with computers, and watching shows like Family Ties you will love this book. It like Willy Wonka wrapped in the Matrix with a splash of old Japanese robots. Very entertaining!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Good game lots to do challenging and you don't need friends to play or advance and have not spent money to play like other games
B0091THRCU|4.0|I was a bit worried about buying this case because of all the complaints about it being overly snug. It was at first but I have about a months worth of use with it and it pretty much broken in now. With this said, my iPhone 5 and Cards don't slip out and they still fit in perfectly. I am using about 2.5 cards in the slot (Sheets gas card, Debit card and my business card) and that's all I need in a wallet.<br /><br />The reason why I am giving a 4/5 is because after about a month of use, the 'Leather' is starting to peel around the edges of the pull strap slot but I think that should be expected since it constantly being used and the strap is rubbing the case every time. Also the pull tab is showing brown from peeling I'm guessing. I have uploaded some photos for examples:<br /><br />Strap slot peeling<br />[...]<br /><br />Pull tab exposed under leather<br />[...]<br /><br />This doesn't bother me since I considered the pull tab side the back of the case. and I never notice it in practical use. I mainly wanted to warn other people who might be concerned about the quality. If that pull tab wasn't there the case would look mint even after a month of use.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really, if you're a fan, it's great, characters are full and real and wonderful. Everyone should watch Downton Abbey. You'll be speaking with a British accent and looking for your ballgown to wear while you watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and time passes very fast and it has places from the movie and you can defeat people from the movie
B009FBX5M0|4.0|This CD has no music from Adele.  We don't need pop music on this great and powerful soundtrack.  Do not miss this CD one of the better soundtracks I have heard.  Stands on its own super sonic blockbuster to test your stereo system out.<br /><br />Get it now while you still can.
B0063IH60K|2.0|It's ok for the price but I am glad I did not have to pay for it. The ads are tedious. Amazing how many pairs. appear.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|The way they do the learning and the intelligence of the apes and gorillas is crazy good! This is a MUST-SEE
B007J7LFTW|3.0|It seems like the reviews for this album are either great or terrible. As a lifelong Tull fan, I find that I can see both sides. It's not a great album by any stretch of the imagination, and if you're not a Tull fanatic I would advise you to pass. But I find myself going back to listen to it more than I thought I would. On paper, the negatives would seem to more than outweigh the positives, but there IS something going on here.<br /><br />First, the negatives. Calling it Thick As A Brick was already setting expectations WAAAAYYYY too high. It never approaches that groundbreaking level. It's not a Tull album anyway, but a solo project.<br /><br />The band is competent but not outstanding. Clearly, this is Anderson's show all the way.<br /><br />The album is much more of a concept album than the \\"original\\", yet the \\"concept\\" is as subtle as a flying mallet (to quote another favorite artist). Basically, it's about all of the possible life paths of Gerald Bostock, the fictitious poet from the original Thick As A Brick. The lyrics are often embarrassingly bad, and some of the spoken segments (just in case we don't get the idea) are nearly cringe-worthy. Anderson has very little sympathy for the various Bostock lives he created: the wealthy businessman is a greedy crook, the shop keeper is a boring dolt with a barren wife, the man of religion is, well, exactly what you'd expect from Ian Anderson. There were possibilities for some real emotion, some depth and introspection: why couldn't the shopkeeper have given up a promising career for love? A priest could certainly have some painful decisions before deciding to pursue his calling. But Anderson took the easy way out: all of the personae are black-and-white, mostly black.<br /><br />And yet.....<br /><br />The band SOUNDS like the old Jethro Tull. No synthesizers, no world music. Guitars, keys, bass, drums, flute, that same sound, just like the glory days. Not as much flute as I would like, but it's there. And Ian is in possibly the best voice in years.<br /><br />Parts of the album actually grab you and take you back to those glory years. Not entire songs, but bits and pieces, snippets here and there. My two favorite songs, as entire songs, are Adrift And Dumbfounded (not actually new) and Kismet In Suburbia, but there are parts of other songs that really capture that old sound and feel. There's a fair amount of crap to wade through, but those few good parts are really good, and a good bit of the rest is at least decent.<br /><br />Maybe it's not the album itself. Perhaps listening to it makes me think that maybe, just maybe, Ian Anderson has one more really good album left in him. Maybe even, dare I say, a great album? And maybe just the fact that that possibility even exists is the best thing about TAAB2.
B0060FXDCG|4.0|The special effects and the battle scenes are great but a few places get lost in huge views and you can't determine what is really happening.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This is a great SF movie that kept me guessing to the end.  The story line is compelling and the visuals are stunning.  Sound effects are amazing!  I have no idea why critics on rotten tomatoes knocked this one:  I guess it has more to do with Cruise then the film.  Go ahead, rent it but you may want to watch it at least a second time!
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|In my opinion is better than the first, but the first one had more humor.  Lot more action too with new characters.
B00003CXD5|5.0|We are huge Humphrey Bogart fans. This is a break from his traditional detective\gangster roles and he did an amazing job. Our only regret is that we weren't around to see it when it was playing at a theater.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season three is a dramatic powerhouse. So cool, so stylish, so fine. The HD version here at amazon is a visual feast every time.
0767827791|5.0|It was an xmas gift for my mom and one of her favorite movies. Although I think she watches it when its on tv more than on dvd.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A joy to suspend disbelief and get lost in the Night Circus. Whimsical. Delicious. Tender. A wonderful fairytale. More true than fiction.
B0000549B0|5.0|Because of this movie, our cat has a name. Such a well done movie with great acting. Do not watch the remake, it's terrible! Stick to the original.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Awesome movie, even better than I was expecting.  A lot of blood and killing as expected but way funnier than I ever imagined it would be....... Don't like Leo as a bad guy though.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I think this book brings up some very important topics such as weight loss which isn't predicated on low carbs. It discusses the effects of wheat. The author did a great job on this. Another book you could read is [[ASIN:B00EBXO5DA How I Lost 60 Pounds of Fat The Real Science Behind Rapid Weight Loss 10 Steps You Can Make To Achieve A Healthy Body (Healthy Lifestyle Series)]] This book also highlights the different weight loss techniques which may be helpful. Brandon Ruse talks about rapid weight loss and healthy choices. I enjoyed Wheat Belly!
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|Very amusing.  I've never watched a LEGO movie before but since I am a Batman fan thought I would give it a try and was happy I did.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I really liked this movie. It was much different from the book I read as a child; but, technology and modern times makes it better.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I watched episode one and was hooked.  I don't buy many tv shows but this one was a must have, cannot wait until season 2.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Who would of thought such a thing being electronic and easy to follow.  I love my bible app, and I get different bible verses on a daily basis.  It beats carry the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's actually a lot of fun to play compared to other games out there! I definitely would recommend it to my friends and family. I just hope that the other rooms hurry and get loaded so I don't have to wait for them that would be the only downfall about this app other than that I really like it pretty good app!!
B002JC9RMY|1.0|If your a DB fan you should pretend this movie doesn't even exist, there is nothing in this that even relates to the anime/manga other then the fact the lead character's name is Goku
B00A83075M|5.0|My boyfriend & I watched this in theaters for our 1-year anniversary. I'm getting him the DVD for year 2. That's love.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not at all the powerful ending I was hoping for.  It seemed like she just got bored with her own story. I guess I just didn't see it ending so abruptly.
B00CATSONE|4.0|i loved this book!!! i read it in just an hour because i couldn't stop. i had no idea who was this man and i am amazed of all his discoveries and inventions, he lived ten lives in one. thank you so much for this great book
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's like the Sims (kindle free edition) for my inner thirteen year-old self.  It's a fun way to pass the time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is a great way to teach children to plan, budget, and. design the world around them. Lots of fun.
B008DM4OTA|1.0|I thought I'd give this company a shot & let my 20- month-old try the free version. BIG MISTAKE. I'm so grateful she was looking away when I opened the app because in the top center is a big button asking if you want to play the full version. This button takes you straight to Amazon's 1-click purchase page. This isn't buried in a parent's menu, it's just there. According to many of the reviews of the game- both positive and negative- children who are old enough to understand what that button does will be bored silly by the game. It's designed for very young children, and its designed to trick them into buying the full version & other games. This company & devs should be ashamed & embarrassed for praying on the innocence of children. Be aware parents, and beware of this company & their series of apps.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of those books you just can't put down. It was totally believable. Well written, making you want the heroes to survive.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really like this it helps.clean up my Kindle Fire H.D.and it helps speed it back up again to by cleaning up stuff I am.not using anymore .I think you would be happy with this download
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I don't know because we never found him.  It was way to difficult for my 4 1/2 year old granddaughter so I had to uninstall it.  We never found Waldo.
B001XVD2Z0|1.0|The Amazon app on my Blueray player repeatedly stopped playback and returned to the Amazon menu.  The playback was jittery.  Fast forward and rewind were nearly useless.  My advice is stick to Netflix or iTunes.  Those worked fine.  If there was a way to request a refund for this rental, I would.  It is not worth the time.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book was just alright for me. Maybe it was because I knew it was the last of the series, it just didn't fill the need I had to wrap everything up with a tidy little bow.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is a really good working app. i love that you can set a time once and it can turn on by itself whenever u need it to just by setting it to do that.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Tremendous biography of one of the greatest innovators of our time!  Definitely recommend this book to anyone who owns a cell phone, computer or music playing device:-)
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is the best I have used it simple to control and understand the basic. This a great app
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|A *real* sci-fi movie!  Not the dumbed-down stuff we normally see in a movie of this scope.  Very, very refreshing.  Great cinematography, very well acted, all around just such a nice change.  Also, major points for not being overly graphic.  This movie was very story-driven but at the same time really draws you in with its visuals.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great graphics free roam so worth it I bought thinking it was gonna be a other sucky game but it was awesome
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show that i never knew about.  I would definitely recommend the series to anyone no matter what type of shows they enjoy.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Bruce still has it going on even with no hair. He is one handsome devil :)<br />Just need to add a scene with him riding off on a horse :) LOL
B00513HXE2|5.0|This is one of the best Star Wars books out there. It is a combination of a political thriller, and serves as an intro into the world of Episode 1.  A must read for any Star Wars fan.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|I've been following KT Tunstall since Black Horse and the Cherry Tree made it's debut, and to be honest,  that rhythmic upbeat tempo was what I liked so much about her music for the longest time. I have recently started paying much closer attention to her slower, more introspective songs and have been amazed at what I'm hearing.  IE / CM is an entire album of introspective, mellow tunes. This album is a must listen with headphones because there are a LOT of subtleties that would be easy to miss otherwise. I have been listening to it at work - it's great work music because it is stimulating, but not distracting. The way she layers her vocals (and vocalizations) is fascinating.  This would be a great album to listen to on headphones with the lights turned off and a few candles burning. Yeah,  I know.  That sounds kind of hippy dippy, but this album is mesmerizing.  Highly recommended.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics and puzzles in this game were wonderful! Well with $2. I just stay there was a little more to the story line. Can't wait till the next one comes out!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I could hardly stop reading this novel. As someone who has never lived in a war zone and a woman in a country where women are not treated like property, it was eye-opening. Khaled Hosseini is a brilliant author and weaves a story of two women and their lives in war-torn Afghanistan. While the characters are fictional, the stories are completely believable. The story also gives a good summary of recent history in Afghanistan apparently without bias. It will make me more compassionate towards Afghan refugees and makes me want to learn more about the region and the current events there.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Froze CONSTANTLY!!! Don't waste your time on this app. Never made it through a video. Deleted this as soon as I discovered TubeMate.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great utility. Consistently reduces memory usage on my Kindle Fire HD by at least 35% .  Also does a great job cleaning out cache and other unused disk files.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I use this so much, it's great. Nearly identical to YouTube on the computer. Can't get my playlists to Play All, but maybe I just haven't figured that out yet.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So this little bad boy just came in the mail today, and I was all kinds of excited. I took it out of the box, plugged it in, and five minutes later I'm watching music videos from YouTube in HD on the Screen. It looks great, and was super easy to set up. Unfortunately I do not have a Netflix account, and the free three months doesn't come for another 5 days per Amazon's e-mail notifications, so right now, all I can do video wise is watch YouTube. Funny cats, and people falling down are funny and all, and Ted Talks are interesting, but sometimes you just need a long movie to cuddle up to. Then I get this great idea. I have an Amazon Prime account, and I can watch movies on my computer, why not try and Chromecast it! I am a genius! Thousands of movies streaming to my TV and I don't have to wait for Netflix! I'm even more excited now, so I figure out I have to get a little Chrome add on called Google Cast, and I get ready to watch the first movie that pops up on the screen, The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Too bad it doesn't work, or at least it doesn't yet. The screen on the TV pops up, but the video doesn't play, just a black bar, and it just continues to play on the computer.<br /><br />I really hope that Amazon gets on this. I've been refusing to pay for X-Box Live account to watch my Prime movies on my TV for quite a while now. I shouldn't have to pay Microsoft to access the internet when I already have the internet, you know what I'm saying? I know you PS3 owners do. Anyway, Amazon needs to step up, and jump on this bandwagon like they have with X-Box, and eventually Playstation 3. It would be a huge value added to me, a loyal Prime customer for going on 3 years now, and will definitely keep me from cancelling my beloved free shipping to get some movies in my room on a decent sized television for less than $100 a year.<br /><br />The Chromecast gets 5 stars for the ease of setup, and how great the video actually looks, but gets 3 stars on launch titles/ products. Thewhole thing feels kind of Beta, which makes me swell with nerdy pride, but I'm 30 now, and really just want as much value for my dollar, rather than the latest greatest thing to come out of a tech company.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Awesome.  Not just for kids.  I started last week  and I admit, I'm hooked!  Love to win win win!!!!!! Two thumbs up
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|Okay, I'm probably in the minority. But I am a huge fan of LOTR and own four versions--theatrical DVD and Blu & Extended DVD and Blu. So I'm allowed to opine. Despite all the terrific special effects and fine performances, The Hobbit is simply too long winded for its own good. There's probably a decent two hour movie in there, but the theatrical Hobbit is nearly three hours long and the extended apparently a bit longer. Not only am I not the slightest bit interested in an over-overblown extended version of the film, I would pay money for a cut version of about 2 hours. P.S.After just viewing the movie again on the Theatrical Blu Ray, I can allow that there's much entertainment to be had here. But it just drives me nuts to see these ridiculously long and utterly impossible chases where our heroes are bouncing hundreds of feet down off rock faces and such, yet emerge pretty much unscathed at the bottom; I'm thinking mostly of the battling rock monsters and inside the lair of Mountain King Goblin. Do different rules of physics apply in Middle Earth? What those dwarves hobbits went through should be fatal.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is fun and addictive it's only flaw would be it takes to long to get upgrades.  All in all though fun game with amazing graphics.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|This was very entertaining.  The only thing wrong is I ran out of puzzles! I hope<br />they create some more.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Headset works amazing, even refurbished I bought it came like-new everything worked perfectly battery (with constant 100% use) lasts me about 6-8 hours, without using it constantly I haven't even ran it out, it lets you know when you have less than an hour left on the battery so you can plug it in without it randomly dying, the voice mods are hilarious and fun to use, the software it comes with is super lightweight and it very helpful and easy to use, would buy again!!!
0525478817|4.0|In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar one Roman nobleman says to another: \\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.\\" John Green, in his little modern romantic epic, argues otherwise: There is plenty of fault in our stars.<br /><br />A tragic teen romance with existential philosophy, in the hands of an amateur, is a terribly self-indulgent combination. But John Green, having spent ten years and hundreds of drafts to find his story, makes no mistakes.<br /><br />Hazel is sixteen, with terminal cancer, when she meets handsome cancer-survivor Augustus at her Cancer Kid Support Group. Hazel is fascinated with a novel about cancer called `An Imperial Affliction'. But she is puzzled by the novel's ambigious ending. To find out what happens to the book characters, Augustus makes it possible for them to travel to Amsterdam, where the author lives. Along their journey to love they grapple with the questions: Is life fair? What is the point if it all ends - not just in reality but even, eventually, in memory?<br /><br />While on the surface, a story about a girl dying of cancer may sound unappetizing YA reading, Green makes it funny, bold, insightful and irreverent. Hazel, Augustus and their friend Isaac play video games, go shopping, get drunk and wonder about kissing just like normal teenagers. They hate sympathy and being defined by their illness, even though their lives are circumscribed within their rapidly diminishing physical capacities.<br /><br />Due to their medical condition, the teenagers are forced to grapple with the reality of their own temporariness and realize that being temporary does not mean being unimportant or meaningless; that forever can exist within numbered days. At one point, Gus says to Hazel, \\"I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\\"<br /><br />As author John Green explained to a reader: \\"Every single human being alive on the entire planet is going to die, including you. The question for me is not why we die; the question is what constitutes a full and well-lived life. I wanted to argue that a good life need not be a long one.\\"that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\\"<br /><br />As author John Green explained to a reader: \\"Every single human being alive on the entire planet is going to die, including you.

B006M9NJFG|5.0|Just went on a week long backpacking trip with the canteen cup as my only cooking utensil, worked like a charm on a little stove I made from a can, the rubber handles help keep it cool to the touch, wouldn't recommend using it in a fire unless you have handles away from flames, other than that cleans easily and everything it came with seems extremely durable, 0 complaints here!! would buy again.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Beaurifully written. Amusing, thoughtfull an excellent read.Anyone who has known an austic person will relate to this story with a positive edge.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Enjoy the medical terminology, description of skeletal and anatomical analogy, and analysis of situations in the storyline. What I do not like is the profanity that Authors seem to feel necessary. My mother taught me that usage showed lack of vocabulary.
0312330537|5.0|I have given a 10/10 on my scale to a Pepper Steak I had at a Spanish restaurant in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia - and to SHANTARAM. How one man combines such a brutal physical self with that level of intellect is beyond my grasp. Love, respect, friendship and the keenest of observations are the constants in this masterpiece, along with superb penmanship. I've said it once and I'll say it again: if given the chance to have a beer and a talk with anyone - dead or alive - I'd choose Roberts AKA \\"Linbaba.\\" Just the thought of the Standing Babas, Arthur Road Prison or the secret passageways of Madame Zouh's Palace gives me a reason to want to continue exploring the universe. SHANTARAM IS A MUST-READ!!
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|A most beautiful story for everyone to enjoy!!  This certainly shows how much easier our lives would be, if we could practice love and forgiveness daily.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Be there for others. They were there for us and even if they were not, mentoring is the right thing to do.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Makes me want to do more reading and research about prisons and prison reform.  The people were described with detail and humor.  I can understand how it became a televised series.

B002KVCA1O|4.0|This album I got for the $5 begining month special. It doesn't have all their greats but the one's it has are good ones.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Personally, I have not been a big fan of this movie because when I saw it for the first time some years ago I was so tired that did not pay that close attention that it really deserved. Based on that, I decided lately to give it a try, so after purchasing the  3D version of it and watching in its REAL DIMENSION I could finally understand the REAL VALUE of seeing such a fantastic  film that takes you to the REAL PANDORA and embraces you un a unique breathtaking journey that worths every dollar you have spent for this!<br /><br />Plus, I invite any doubtful purchaser to get enchanted with this Combo pack due to you can see it through different formats everywhere you want.<br /><br />Unfortunately it does not come with any extra material ( deleted scenes, interviews, making of, etc) but it does not matter that much since you can purchase the other EXTENDED VERSION  as well for you to complete your enjoyment.<br /><br />NOTE: there is no 3D version of the extended version just in case, so the fact of watching THIS movie in 3D motivated me to have it and I do not have any regrets at all!!!!<br /><br />So TAKE THE JOURNEY TO PANDORA IN 3D!!! I WARRANTY YOU WILL &#34;LIVE &#34; THE TRIP THOROUGHLY!!!!<br /><br />:D
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|this is an awesome game and i like that you get to play with real people but you have to pay to play meaning you have to buy coins so you can play a game

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This room was awesome. Waiting for the next. Can't recommend any changes to the game since this is the first of its kind I've seen. Can't go wrong if you like this kind of a challenge.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I am a huge gaga fan and i haddddd to have this this thank you fast shipping i give them a A+
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|So, did you watch \\"Cloverfield\\" and wish there was some way we could have fought back?  \\"Pacific Rim\\" is your answer.  It's not overly complex, it's not \\"deep\\" in any way, shape or form (nor does it try to be).  It's just plain fun, a real rollercoaster ride from start to finish.  Visually stunning, fantastic CGI and oh...yes, there is some acting in there too :)
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|for valentines day and she loved it we are both HUGE Pretty Little Liar fans and she loved it :)
159463176X|2.0|Nothing at all like The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Was boring and jumped all over the place. Very confusing and did not keep my interest.  Best part of the book was probably the first 15 pages:(:(  really like this author but was very disappointed!!!
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS CD PRIMARILY FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND LIKE USUAL...I AM LOVING IT MORE THAN HER.  THIS ARTIST IS JUST SO....TALENTED!!!!<br /><br />SHE IS PERFORMING @ A SMALL VENUE IN NYC ....SHE SOLD OUT IN 3 HOURS!!!!  AMAZING!<br />ONE MINOR DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE CD - THERE IS ONE SONG THAT IS A DIFFERENT VERSION<br />THAN THE VIDEO I HAD SEEN ELIMINATING HER FEATURED GUEST, BUT AN AWESOME SONG, NONETHELESS!!!
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Was just disappointing in every way, was not at all what I was expecting. This movie was just a big failure
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|The game is just like playing when I was a kid. It is also a very good time waster. Wish they gave you more tokens to play more frequently though
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I love N Sparks books and storys since I was a teen and he never fails to make one great love story! This one keeps you on your toes
B000PMLFRA|5.0|They looks absolutely stunning.  Unlike other older movies converted to Blu-Ray, it really looks like it was shot with modern cameras.
B008Y7EYSK|1.0|Was so un scary and just one mess of a film. I cant believe D Radcliffe was in this movie! Was he depressed after Harry Potter ended? IDK
B007PVHMCG|4.0|There are lots of small, single pieces in this set, which makes it a bit of a challenge for younger kids.  My son, who received this for his tenth birthday, knocked it out pretty quick'y, doing about half, taking a break, and coming back to do the other half later.  Instructions were clear and easy.<br />You might want a separate container for this set considering all the small pieces.  Great LEGO quality as always.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Far better then the original Swedish version. Keeps you on edge and on your toes wanting more! Pretty scary also. Not a Twilight movie!
B00634GHJA|3.0|This could be a useful app IF it had a better interface &amp; it gave you a personal URL you could share for computers that aren't connected to the same wifi (like for sharing pics with friends.) My main complaint about the interface that really pissed me off was that I didn't realize it only let you choose multiple pictures from within a single folder. If you choose pics from 1 folder &amp; then try to choose pics from a different folder it won't work. Also, I'm not going to complain about only being able to send pics &amp; videos since that's obviously what the app is made for but it would've been nice if the interface was more tailored for video and picture files~ it'd be nice (for ppl who have many folders with pictures all over the place) if it showed thumbnails on the folders instead of just having a bunch of plain blue folders that you have to click through to find pictures. I kind of liked that it puts multiple pictures in a zip file but I want to choose which folder to send it to like you can do with wifi transfer pro or wifi file explorer pro. It does the very minimal of what I expected it to do 2 years ago but it is still the same basic disappointing app after all this time. So many apps have come so far since then, it's sad to see this app is still the same after all this time. Oh we'll, it can still be useful for some people (at a high price for such a basic app)
B00634GHJA|2.0|I've had this app since it was the FAOTD a few months ago and have used it frequently. My only complaint is that using my KFHD and my SGS3 makes  me use the manual entry because the devices won't recognize each other and its only works going from SG to KF and not the other way. My devices are next to each other and although the upload is fast it takes a severely long time to find the manual address. I hope there is an update soon.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. They have out done themselves. It is the best gameloft game ever.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Really cute game but it would not work very good on my kindle fire it slowed it down a lot but , i also don't play alot of games.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. Some of the scenes are so dark it is hard to find what you are looking for.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have an iPhone 4S and a 2009 G37. The phone would play through the Infiniti adapter but would not charge. Now it does.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After waiting almost 25 years for the final book, A Memory of Light doesn't disappoint!! No spoilers here, but Mr. Sanderson has finally completed the Wheel of Time series in fine style, having taken Mr. Jordan's epic story to an exquisite end!  My only wish is that there be more stories of the Dragon - and the remaining cast of heroes - in the future!!  Don't miss this book!!!!
B003DZX44I|5.0|This really is the ideal copy of Beauty and the Beast to purchase. The Blu-ray/DVD combo gives you the flexibility to use it on different machines, even if currently you only have one. The best part about it is that you can choose between watching the extended edition and the original theatrical edition. The difference is mainly in the inclusion of a song called &#34;Human Again.&#34; For those of us who grew up watching the VHS and want what we love, it's great that we can choose the original version. The previous DVD release included the extended version only. So this one is definitely the one to buy if you want the flexibility of having multiple formats and multiple versions.
0345529057|5.0|I like the way the autor narrates the story. The places involved and all the magic that takes place in te history.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno  and this app is the best I play it all the time blab blab balboa Blake dhdiznsj sjsusnd sjsksns
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Best game ever I loved it was going to be the best game ever I mean the first one was going on in a happy mood and the first time I played I love it
B004ISVH7U|5.0|I happened to catch the last 1/2 of the documentary The Harmony Game / Songs of America on TV and it was so good that I had to see the rest of it.  The packaging and write-ups about this product are not clear, but the DVD does in fact contain this documentary and it is so, so good.  It gives me an appreciation for both of these guys and their personality/skill that I didn't have before.  I always loved their music but this brought that love to a whole new level.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun and challenging for  all ages you should get this apps peeps because you have more this to do since the fruit ninga  got upgraded  and it is so cool
B000001DVD|5.0|I used to own this on album and tape, and since I cannot buy Def Leppard on iTunes, I went ahead and bought this CD. It arrived quickly and was in perfect condition.  Great to hear the good old songs again!
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Overall pleased with it but it should have been more clear about which devices it supports. Lightning adapter not included. Also - no A/C adapter included?<br />But the battery capacity seems good and it's easy to use and compact.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is my favorite time killer, I play it every we're, plus it's free, no point in not trying it out for yourself (:
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Awesome way to upgrade the sound output from your Airport Express.  Just don't plug the USB power input of this thing into the USB port of your Airport Express, unless you want to &#34;hear&#34; your network traffic as odd sounds over your stereo.  Use the included plug AC adapter to power it and you're fine!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|So obsessed with this show. cant wait for the next season to start! I highly reccommend everyone starts folllowing this series.
1401924751|3.0|As a former career counselor, there is a big problem with this deck. Virtue only presents a very limited amount of \\"purposes\\", all of which are \\"New Age.\\" What about the (many) people who see their life purpose in science, or business or other areas. Not every one is \\"called\\" to work with crystals, flowers, music, etc (which are specific cards in this deck). I think this a a major error and seems more reflective of Doreen's personal interests, not the wider world.
0062238868|5.0|A fantastic story of a amazing hero. Bought this book for my husband to read while traveling to military training. He loved it so much we ordered the next book wrote about him by his wife. Truley an American Hero!
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Her artistic ability is mesmerizing to watch on screen.  Highly recommended action drama with a dash of sci-fi from BBC America.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|need the real candy crush app. 1 star unroll we get it!! please make this happen and I will change star rating to 5
1452126577|4.0|I thought this book was cute. I read it in about an hour.....and found it quite funny.  I had never heard of the Grumpy cat before buying this book. He is right-on with many of his sayings pertaining to cats.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot better than subway surfers because subway surfers it is the same thing over and over. But Minion Rush there is more different things.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It work for a week then it would not work for 2 months and then It leap freezing  I'm done with this stuipd app.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I am using it on a Kindle and not having any problems at all. I like the variety of puzzles within the puzzle.  Highly recommend. :)
0374203032|5.0|After watching a TV interview with the author I thought it was worth taking a look. It is an excellent read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series really kept me interested in what was coming next. LOVED IT. The way the lawyers figured out their next move was brilliant.
0739370642|5.0|I really couldn't put this book down until I finished it. Loved it.<br />The other two are not bad, but this is by far the best one.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I would like more animation with the characters but that being said, I don't have any more complaints.  am enjoying the game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game for everyone. My whole family enjoyed it. Only negative is need to purchase the game after a certain level
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love love love this game I think it's awesome definitely a 5 it just can't get any better. So yes I would recommend this game to a friend
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for people that like to care for animals. It's great for any age level especially 8-13 years. You should trust all of the 5-star reviews including this one.  GET THIS APP!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter and I both have this on our kindle and we both love it. The graphics are spectacular and its a game anyone can play. Lots of fun not too difficult.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|some of what the author says is certainly true, and maybe if you'd never read a book about women advancing in the workplace you would be surprised.  but, really?  not worth the price, it is perfectly mediocre
B004T4KKSA|5.0|Great read, especially for a young engineer entering the industry. Highly recommended for anyone passionate about energy and interested in an unbiased opinion about the history of the most energy dense liquid fuel.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was as well written as the last 2 books of his that I've read.  I saw a couple of the other posted reviews, and I think that the lack of &#34;punch&#34; they are responding too isn't lack of punch, but a story told about families in a much more sweet, sensitive way.  No real horrors, just real life and how it affects us.  Still had me in tears at the end, although I suspect it's because it hit close to home for me.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|The game over all is amazing but the problem is that there isn't alot of guns in the game I know it just started our but they should add more especially free guns we can use in the game. [...]
B006TVQU6C|4.0|Very well constructed, easy to install components. One thing I dislikes was the SSD enclosure was very different than pictured.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's a very good game. There are so many hybrid dragons to create and very many beautiful and cool dragons to discover. To me I think it's almost a stress-free game but there are some hard parts like saving up coins and waiting for dragons to need and hatch. At first the quests seem hard but once you know what you're doing it is a piece of cake. The point is that it's a great game. I would suggest it for kids and adults. If you do download it I hope you have fun and find my review helpful and good luck.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Pre-previews I was really expecting so much of this movie.  Having read the reviews I wasn't expecting much.  TBH, while I'm glad I didn't spend the $10 plus to see it at a theatre, Oz G&P on line way better than I expected.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! I am wowed by it! It's fun, it's totally addictive, and I find it better than temple run! The only down side is that reviving takes a lot of tokens.
0062064304|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moN3MZDEU8W9N1]]A very nice art book from the film \\"District 9\\".  Weta Workshop created many of the designs, props, and technology used in the film - they also worked on films like Lord of the Rings and Avatar.  The design work from Weta is always top-notch, and in this book we get to see a lot of cool concepts.  If you thought that \\"District 9\\" was a great film like I did, then I'm sure you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />What's included in the book:<br />- Conceptual art and CG models of the Aliens<br />- Alien Technology and Weapons<br />- The Exo-Suit<br />- Alien Mothership designs<br />- The alien's written language<br />- MNU logos and Anti-Alien signs<br />- MNU trucks/vehicles
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun on the go for me and my family kids Thanks So Much &lt;3 I'm 29 lol but Love This Game.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Love this game but why does it show all the goals I've already done almost each time I open it.  It's like it runs through each and every goal there's ever been.  It's kinda annoying.  Also it keeps telling g me there is a weekly update how do I update the game.  Thanks.
0393343405|5.0|Excellent service but please, don't force people to write recommendations.  It's counterproductive, offensive and annoying.  If they would like to write something, they should. Forcing people may lead to unfair and damaging reviews. I am writing a good one here but... I may not be so kind the next time around.<br /><br />Update: I just checked that I had to do the same for the other products that I purchased and of course, I decided not to do so.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in our Stars..... What can I say about this FANTASTIC book? One of the best of 2012 I can tell you that! This is John Green's 4th solo book and I have read 3/4 of his books. All I can say about Mr. Green is that he is surely one of the best authors of our generation. This book is about a 16 year old girl who is a survivor of Type 4 Thyroid cancer and it has spread to her lungs. Hazel , just wants everyone to accept that we are ALL gonna die. Until she meets Augustus Waters that is , a sexy , funny 17 year old , who himself osteosarcoma( common to bone cancer). They experience some crazy stuff together. The stuff teenagers experience , but so much more pure and pulling at your heart. If you want a fantastic read that gives you all the emotions, PLEASE I beg of you pick up John Green's The Fault in our Stars. You will surely not regret it.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Great first book in the Harry Hole series.  I think these are better than the Dragon Tattoo series. Happy Reading!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|That app works awesome on me Kindle Fire. I can listen to local radio or stuff outta China if I so choose. I use it all the time and haven't had any problems with it.
B00BFPX132|5.0|I'm not sure why this is, but with the possible exception of Slayer, the Big 4 in various ways have seriously stumbled in recent years and are hardly worth their attention any more, especially thanks to the racist hate speech of Dave Mustaine, Metallica's total selling out and Anthrax hardly putting out any new material, \\"Worship Music\\" the first in what, 12 years?  Now I haven't heard it so I won't comment on it, but I've read tons of reviews that state Megadeth's latest is absolute shit.  Your opinion may vary.<br />  Not so with the Big 3 out of Germany.  Kreator, the kingpins worthy of the Slayer crown have stomped us with \\"Hordes Of Chaos\\" and \\"Phantom Antichrist\\", Destruction have released two equally ferocious latter albums, \\"Spiritual Genocide\\", the new one, and \\"Day of Reckoning\\".  Sodom, the third band in this trinity of the heaviest thrash out there, have done the same thing, following up the excellent \\"War and Pieces\\" with their new slab \\"Epitome of Torture\\".  Age has certainly made no impact on these bands' music - if anything, they're getting heavier all the time.<br />  That said, Sodom have really come a long way from the first album, one so terrible it got them a record deal, if you believe the hype.  Actually, it was more attitude than musicianship, but many debut metal albums were the same way and are classics.  \\"Obsessed With Cruelty\\" was a slop job, but had the spirit of Venom, early Motorhead and Slayer in abundance.  They believed in the music and recorded it in much better form later.  But Kreator's first, \\"Endless Pain\\" wasn't much more polished, either.  And we all know the rawness of Venom's \\"Welcome To Hell\\" or \\"Motorhead\\", the first album after Lemmy left Hawkwind.  It's that spirit that real rock and roll loves to live in.<br />  So Sodom have switched lineups many times, with bassist/vocalist Tom Angelripper the only constant.  They have stayed with the current lineup for a couple albums now, and the cohesiveness shows.  With the superb guitarist Bernamann and drummer Makka, Sodom have never been tighter or more powerful.  \\"Epitome of Torture\\" doesn't let up, and in fact flirts unashamedly with death metal, showing how close the two genres actually are.  We would not have great death metal bands like Death, Autopsy or Suffocation, to name a few, without thrash's influence.<br />  This CD is a work that requires listening to it all.  No single track outrocks the other -  in fact, it's punishing and brutal throughout.  Along with Destruction's and Kreator's latest, Sodom demonstrate that the real Big 3 are far heavier and keeping it up better than most U.S. bands.  Only Exodus, Lamb of God and some of the better known death bands reach the intensity of Sodom and their buddies.b guitarist Bernamann and drummer Makka, Sodom have never been tighter or more powerful.  \\"Epitome of Torture\\" doesn't let up, and in fact flirts unashamedly with death metal, showing how close the two genres actually are.

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|It's been 26 years since I graduated from high school, but Rowell's descriptions of what it feels like to fall in love for the first time, of the physical sensations that grip young hearts and bodies as teens discover one another, instantly took me back to 1985, and times with the boy I thought I needed in order to breathe....<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved both Park and Eleanor as characters.  Eleanor's home life was so abysmal, and the story became a bit tedious just having to drudge through it, but in the end, this was a well-told story, with characters who are easy to root for, lightened up a bit by the 80s time frame.  Who knew that this 44 year old could so easily be transported back to high school and get lost in the experience?  Well done, Rainbow.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|The Withings pulse is the best fitness / sleep tracker on the market with a pulse taker as a nice bonus. Fits nicely within the Withings ecosystem.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|As a child of the 80's I LOVE this movie and all the references to the games I played as a child.  My kids loved the concept.  It was great for both boys and girls a like!
B003O86FMW|5.0|So much more intense than the first. It's one unexpected turn off events after another. I was dying to pick up the third book as soon as I finished the last sentence.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This was a good movie.  I enjoyed watching this one and have watched it already a few times. I didn't see it in the theather but wasn't dissapointed by watching it at home.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Why not five stars?...Hey, this IS a happy, feel good, cut'em up, beat'em up, shoot'em up, and blow'em up movie. In the quest for \\"world dominion\\"....there are always the sane, and the insane...the good, and the evil.....as the \\"Joes\\" enlist the help of \\"the General\\", ( Willis)..the game is on....great characters, fight scenes, effects, soundtrack. It's a nice escape from the actual real world news, where nothing is done about anything....I liked this movie.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I expected more out of this movie.  The ending fell flat for me.  I mean come on, the ending was a little lame for me.  I think I just expected too much.  Entertaining though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is way awesome. very addictive. even the kids can play and have fun. would totally recommend this game to friends.
0064471837|5.0|Set in a world split by a magical wall, with technology on one side and magic on the other, Sabriel is one of the best books I have ever read, and one I'm proud to own. The plot is compelling and driven, carried along by strong characters including Sabriel herself. Raised mostly in the technology fueled country of Ancelstierre, Sabriel is suddenly thrown into her father's role of Abhorsen, a necromancer whose duty is to keep the dead down, when a sending informs her that her father needs her help.<br /><br />I first picked this book up eight years ago, but it still continues to be one of my favorite books. Nix's unique take on Death and magic, as well as military and civilian scenes are as wonderful to read today as the first time I read Sabriel.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great app use it all the time! I use it on my kendle so its easy to read and always handy.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|This release has totally surpassed my expectations.  I like the old school metal sound with huge riffs and this CD has plenty of them.  If you want speed metal, look elsewhere.  If you want heavy in your face power metal, then do yourself a favor and pick this one up!
B008L5G4I8|5.0|It is amazing that there was once a world without Hercules Peroit and Captain Hastings. This book introduced these two characters, set in the World War I era of England, with a murder no one else can solve. What a delight to reread this twisted plot and the interesting characters!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun to play. The essence of the crazy little minions is in the game. Listening to the minions giggle and talk is just as funny as in the movie. Great game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've constantly wished for a better way to manage all the news sites and blogs I follow while on my first gen kindle fire. I found feedly to be an awesome answer to my needs. I can browse daily feeds by subject or all at once. Adding new feeds is simple thanks to feedly's search function. It's simple and easy to use. I love it.
B0000714BP|5.0|thank you so much! i love and will be back for more! perfect gift for anyone! have a great one
B008CUVOKK|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read! Keeps you on your toes...I can't wait for book 6! These books are not easy reads, but are worth the time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is fun,epic,awesome and whats more its suitable for younger children.<br />WARNING CAN BE ADDICTIVE<br />Have fun :) i know i love it <3
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Strong story about hope and man's inhumanity against his own kind. Loved the ending. Made me feel like I was a part of the story.
B007SGM084|5.0|LOVED the series! It was a great book find and I enjoyed reading it. Hope everyone reads it and enjoys!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is great for wasting time. Me and my family love it. I just think maybe we should get more coins for solving the puzzles, but other than that we absolutely love it!!!!!
B0097C8XL0|3.0|it was just so much fun at first and then now when I go on it I can only go to 510 . it just glitches
B0012ZQ3OE|3.0|Not a lot to say about Elf.  Not too funny and not too sad.  I'll type six no three more words to get to submit.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I've only been playing the game for a short period of time and I love the challenge. The graphics are beautiful!
B00338QENI|5.0|Who knew? Not me that's for sure. For decades researchers have used these cells and how many of us asked where they came from? How much money was made because of the uniqueness of this young woman's cells? And not a dime to her family. Typical of the world we live in.  Extraodinary story!
B007NWCZR4|3.0|As a not so much known CD for me, it's the standard quality level from PSB. Anyway, it's good to have in your shelf.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|my last bumper case from poetic and the official bumper case had wear and tear on it. im just replceing it becuz it gives my device more of that premium feel to it. also i can show off the back of the device at looks so nice. who wants to hide that.
B00000DQSV|4.0|Hearing DD again brings me back to my university time, with bands like DD, Information Society, Erasure, PSB... and so on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Totally fun and way less boring than the original. More options, costumes, and the actions of the minions are cute and funny.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|As I was here in São Paulo for the show, I'm suspect to give my opinion about PSB. I hope they remain on the way still for a long time.
B003CYKCHW|5.0|I have had this mouse for over two years and its still working great<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Great feel, this mouse may look like a transformer with its jagged edges but it does not feel like it looks, it fits very well in my hand, even before I found out that its palm rest is variable, now after I have adjusted it, its even better. The mat finish gives it a good grippy feel as well.<br /><br />2. Durable, other reviewers may have had issues but I have not. My mouse has not had an easy desk life, I bring it with me to school, to work, anywhere I may use a computer I bring it with and it has performed brilliantly.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Only two programmable buttons, not that i want 100 buttons on a mouse but if you are looking for more that a forwards and back button you may need to look elsewhere *cough* rat5 *cough*<br /><br />2. While durable i have had a problem with the fabric wire sheathing on the USB cable, the fabric kinked the cable so i carefully cut the fabric so that it would not damage the cable. Now there is a section of cable that is exposed. While not damaging the function it did damage the ascetics.<br /><br />3. The ability to change the position of the palm rest was not mentioned anywhere in the documentation for this mouse though it should be because it is much better now that I have adjusted it, it just takes an Allen wrench and a Philips head screwdriver<br /><br />Summary<br />Great mouse for the price, but if you want a more buttons not for you.
0316069884|5.0|This book is interestingly written and concentrates on being factual rather than emotional.  The arguments are persuasive and thoughtful.  I have read other books on the subject, however, this is the book that finally changed me from being a 'waffling' vegan to a real vegan.  After reading this book, it would be very hard to ignore what is happening in the production of animal products for consumption.
B001NN4162|5.0|I've seen this movie a couple hundred times.  My daughter loves this movie.  It really doesn't get old.  Its like Finding Nemo.  There isnt much violence and it has a happy ending so it's a nice introductory movie.  The Lorax is another good one.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Watched the movie with my wife, and although I don't like animated movies much,I expected to be regretting it.  I really enjoyed it. Great for all ages! would recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its a cool app that I enjoy.  It keeps you interested and I'm looking forward to more.  Cant wait u til there are more levels
0307346617|5.0|World War Z mildly grabbed my interest when I first saw it, as in \\"I should read that someday.\\" Then I reallized that Max Brooks was the son of Mel Brooks (of Spaceballs, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, and History Of The World: Part I fame) and my motivation to read it jumped quite a bit. Illogical? Sure, just because I'm a fan of his dad's films doesn't mean his writing will be any good. Nevertheless, I wanted to read this. When they released the film, I downloaded the ebook....and promptly didn't read it until about a week ago. I wish I'd gotten around to reading it sooner, but oh well. My \\"to be read\\" list is truly epic.... I'm told that the audiobook is full-cast and includes such stars as Nathan Fillion....kinda wishing I'd gone that route, honestly. But even just the book was great.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely. The premise is that of an oral history, post zombie-uprising, looking back at the war. The format is of multiple interviews with various survivors, from soldiers to sailors to an astronaut, all around the world, all their individual stories adding up to the big picture of the rise and eventual fall of the living dead. The degree of research that Brooks would have had to do for this book is phenomenal, and very impressively done. The realism lent to the book by this concept is perhaps the most chilling part. Brooks knew where he wanted this to go--a worldwide outbreak--and so studied viruses and how they spread, deciding where to set his \\"Patient Zero\\" cases. From there, everything plays out believeably, from governments' reactions to how the military would react, both initially and later on after the problem was better understood, to how individuals would cope with a world where the dead walk again. If you have read Brooks' other book, The Zombie Survival Guide, you'll know he has a subtle sense of humor that occasionally comes through. Less so in this book, but it's definitely there in certain characters.<br /><br />Content: Violence. This isa book about the Zombie uprising, after all. Language. Some of the characters interviewed are foul-mouthed. Mild sexual content. I honestly don't remember any....
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Reminds me of when I played with my friends back in the day. It has gotten to be a bit addictive lately
B002ONV5E6|4.0|I've enjoyed the series and hope Damon returns for a few more. An action film with solid acting and a plausible storyline.<br /><br />As you can tell from this summer's bumper crop, that's no easy feat.<br /><br />So sit back, relax, have some popcorn and get lost in a good movie.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I Like this app very much. It is easy to read and understand .my has a great look. No regrets with purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I prefer this version better than the other versions but google play has the other versions however amazon does not have the othrsThere is a demo however you can only get it through Google Play
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|While its free, I must say, you shouldn't go on line without it.  It is the intergal part of transferrin information and pictures from one person to another.  It makes large files manageable and readable.  Otherwise everything else would be like reading Greek!
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is adorably cute.  The bouncy kitties when you win are great and their disappointed/crushed faces when you lose are actually really sad to see, so kudos to conveying the appropriate emotions.  But there were several things that bugged me.  One of them was that the currency to do the puzzles (I think they were lightning bolts) didn't continue to add up beyond 5...unless you bought more, since this thing also has micro-transactions.  I did not.  So even when I went on a huge winning streak, my &#34;bank&#34;, as it were, never reflected that.  It reflected my win/lose record *just fine* when I lost and then suddenly I had no more lives, and it showed how much gold I earned, but that's it.  I guess the silver lining is that you get a certain amount of those lightning bolt lives (I really don't know what to call them) for free after a few hours, but who's got time to wait that long when you want to play *now*?<br /><br />The upgrades you can get are pretty nice, although the only one I consistently used was the one that improved your aim...but I stopped buying it when it started costing the purple gem currency, something else that you can also purchase for real money.  As far as I could tell, there was no way to increase the starting amount of those without buying them, which was disappointing.<br /><br />Other than the currency gripes, the gameplay was actually pretty nice.  It was colorful and energetic and there was a pause button, which is always a HUGE plus, believe me.  It's not timed (also very nice), but you do only have a certain number of moves with which to work, which can be a problem if you get stuck (that's not as huge of a deal as it sounds).  The color rotations are random from puzzle to puzzle and even if all you do is one puzzle over and over because you like it, the colors are still random--this can make it challenging, which is okay by me.  You just don't always win.<br /><br />This is, however, another one of those games where solving it quick is not the goal--it's getting as many points and combos as possible while you're tossing bubbles that's the real goal, so you can get a 3 star rating.  SO ANNOYING.  I'm not even sure that perfect rating is necessary, but I felt compelled to attempt it and I don't even know why.  Crazy.  It bugs me when I'm forced to effectively mess up a good move in order to set up a crazy arrangement that might give me more points.  I'm not sure how the scoring system works, but it seemed a little off.  I suspect that there are achievements to get perfect scores in everything, since the counter on the puzzle island seemed to indicate so, but I was never able to get a perfect 3 star rating for everything (I had problems with one of the puzzles consistently not scoring high enough, even after multiple attempts different ways) on the first island, so I don't know for sure.<br /><br />All in all, it's easy, it's mostly brainless, and if you don't mind having to wait a few hours (it was quite a few hours, actually) for some free lives and otherwise don't plan on beating yourself over the head for a perfect score, then you'd probably do all right with this game.  You do have to grasp the concept of where things go because of angles and bouncing, but it was easy enough.  I kept it for a while, but deleted it after realizing my number of lives wasn't going up after winning and that in order to get the bonus long aim thing, I'd have to spend a ridiculous amount of money to purchase a ridiculously priced item.  It was fun while it lasted.

1442359919|3.0|Not what I was expecting from a writer like Stephen King, but it is an easy read, and a warm story line of an older man's recollection of what the world was like when he was 21.  Spooky it is not.  Exciting? Not really, but I certainly enjoyed it, perhaps more so than the gruesome horror story I was expecting.  I guess it's true, that you cannot tell a book by its cover (or its author)!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I earned big brownie points with my wonderful wife when the series were delivered. She watches the reruns and new shows and laughs out loud. i'll have to get her the current series as they come out.

B0099116AY|5.0|Real life is so funny that they continue making movies about it. This movie really is entertaining and the message is delivered by 2 stars that we have all seen in many roles. it is not just a run of the mill flick. Check it out.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This is fun &amp; educational but locks up a lot freeze phone &amp; kindle and runs slow many times.  Becoming not so much fun anymore.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Movies about true stories are always rated by how close to the truth it represents, well the oscars did the rating and the movie speaks for itself. Ben Afflect pulled off a tough movie and did a great job capturing the truth.
0062073192|3.0|I just had to get this book because I love Supernatural so much and now that I'm impatiently waiting for season nine (more Cas! Bobby's back! I can't handle it!!) I needed my little fix during the summer. While some parts of this book written in journal entries were awesome and cool to read, overall it was a little disappointing. There were major information dumps, which I understand because it's written to be like John's actually journal, full of information about creatures out there in the world. But all of that just wasn't as interesting as I think it could have been. Instead I liked it more because I got to read little entries that talked about Sam and Dean growing up. The sad part of the journal came from seeing how John was falling apart as time went on and he spent more and more years searching for the thing that killed his wife.<br /><br />If you're a Supernatural fan I definitely recommend you look into this book. There are a few cute moments recorded here that happened to the Winchesters before the show started and it all leaves off exactly before the start of the first episode. I'd say not to get your hopes up but don't get down about the surplus of creature information, either! Who knows when you'll need that entire formula for an exorcism.<br /><br />Okay, chances are, you won't need it. But it's interesting to learn more about these monsters the Winchesters are battling.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|When watching a movie about the history of our country it is always left to interpertation of ones presentation. I've studied Lincoln in school and found this movie as close as it can be to much of what i read. It was done softer than the real history but close enough. A man that took a stand during a time in our country that many accepted or fought against.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Now I can easily do jigsaw puzzles without worrying about my cats knocking everything off the kitchen table. Lots of puzzles and difficulty levels. I do all 4 sizes starting with the largest size as nd most difficult, then we don't way down to the easiest a nd smallest. Makes you almost feel brilliant.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|It's like one long zombie movie, and it's a great show. Very suspenseful, really keeps you interested. Can't wait to see more.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I'm a Bruce Willis fan.  I like the Die Hard series.  But this movie was just awful from start to finish.  The lighting was terrible.  I couldn't see half the scenes.  The picture was gritty and ugly, and the camera work was terrible.  I could shoot a better picture with my Android phone.  The acting was horrendous.  The story was predictable, and poorly written.  I have nothing good to say about this movie.
B0008ENICU|5.0|...and this movie has it, in spades, and then some.  Need I say more?  By the way this dvd edition does have some bonus features that are very interesting.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|This movie had nothing to do with the first one.  Way different.  I just wasn't interested to see it in the theater, and glad I waited for Digital release.  Should of waited even more for HBO.

And help text, don't show up after you enter flight the first time.. after a while I could navigate without the text.  All of the ads is my main complaint. They have the purchases in app to make money off of. Why all of the full screen ads.<br /><br />Xoom
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this on Facebook and was pleased to see it on my Kindle. I have connected my app to my Facebook account and it works just as it does on the pc. Easy to use and set up how you want it, I have the in-game chat and the music turned off. I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to daub the numbers using my fingers on the touchscreen of my Kindle, but so far, I haven't had a problem. Enjoyable game, if you like bingo, I'm sure you like this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. Its very fun and a great game to play when you get bored. I spend hours beating missions and trying to beat my own high score. I really recommend it.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|I've read and enjoyed every book written by Michael Connelly,including this one.  But this book and the Lincoln Lawyer were not page turners like all of the Harry Bosch novels. I had no problem putting the book down and going to sleep.  Not so with Harry Bosch...can't put them down without reading one more chapter...and then...okay just one more before I get in bed!
B0053KWDES|5.0|I found this unit to be astounding.<br />I paired it with a 7th gen iPod Classic, along with FiiO's own line-out adapter for iPods. The cable included with the unit wasn't quite long enough for what I wanted to do, so I made my own.<br />I attached this unit to the back of the iPod with two pieces of Velcro. The included rubber straps (mine came with 2) are a bit too tricky for my liking.<br />Believe it or not, this unit uses a Nokia BL-5B battery. Look around for an official Nokia battery, mine seems to run much longer off of it than the FiiO branded battery it came with. These batteries are extremely common, so it shouldn't be hard for you to carry around a couple spares. Beware of cheap chargers though!<br />The battery life is really good, but as other reviewers have said, it just cuts out entirely when the battery is too low, which is pretty jarring when you're rocking out.<br /><br />I mainly  use this with some Sony MDR-V6 headphones, and it drives them to painful volumes without any issues. I haven't needed to use the high gain mode or the bass boost, it puts out plenty as it is. I haven't done so yet, but I might just run it in the lower voltage mode next time I pop it open to take out the battery.<br /><br />The volume knob on top is stiff, and if you can't get two fingers around the knob, it's very difficult to turn the unit on or off. Part of why I used Velcro is so I could have the volume knob go past the top of my iPod.<br /><br />Probably the most surprising thing about this unit is the benefit it provides. With the line-out on an iPod, you're completely bypassing the built in amp, and when you do a side-by-side comparison, you can very clearly hear why that's important.<br /><br />The FiiO amp produces a much fuller sound. I'm not sure how to describe it... you can hear so much more detail, everything just has more of a presence. The iPod's headphone output sounds dull and flat in comparison. The difference is really astounding.<br />I showed a friend of mine, and he was blown away too... this is someone with very untrained ears even!<br /><br />Really incredible amp. If you have higher end headphones, this thing is great. It can drive them and give you the clarity your music deserves.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack reacher is one of my favorite characters.  I'd probably buy a Lee Child  book with blank pages if Jack reacher's name were on the cover. I've read and enjoyed all of the Reacher Novels.  Can't wait for the next one!
0060936223|5.0|I would read this over and over again.  She is inspiring, truthful, and makes you feel like you are there with experience she shares. Tearful by the end of the book, not only because of the story, but because you want her story to go on..and on..and on...
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I've read all of the Reacher novels and can't wait for the next one.  Lee Child is the master of suspense and a fantastic story teller.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game please make more types of this game I'm a huge arcade game fan especially bubble games so thanks for making this one
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|My first thoughts when I saw previews for this movie was, \\"Cavemen, really?\\" But I was pleasantly surprised. The story is original, it's well thought out, it's hilarious and heartwarming. We saw it in theaters twice then I came home and preordered it in Amazon. Great, wholesome fun for the whole family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the Minions and so do my kids. Downloaded the game on a whim and was really impressed. The kids love it too.
1932907009|3.0|Snyder is in the family comedy business, and this is a book aimed toward selling a screenplay to studios by making the broadest possible appeal. Snyder scoffs at movies like Memento and praises actors like Vin Diesel and Adam Sandler. He knows how to make a sellable screenplay, but adhering to his write-by-numbers approach confines you to a pretty basic structure that is best for beginners. Snyder confuses the difference between a &#34;good&#34; script and an easily salable one. His basic advice about loglines and titles is broadly applicable but brief, to the point that it could likely be found online, distilled by a more sophisticated source. I bought this book as a curiosity after reading an article about how it has shaped screenwriting and came away equally entertained and frustrated by Snyder's premise and practice.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Fantastic book.  I decided to read it after watching the HBO series, and it doesn't disappoint.  It goes into so many other details than the show does, and you gain a much better insight into the characters.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|first of all those of u who give this movie 1 star obviously have no good taste in movies. thumbs up to lawrence and i cant wait for the second movie!
B00634GHJA|2.0|First, it does nothing other than copy/paste, which can be done via shares or any number of other free ways.<br />Second, here's my list of issues i found.<br />1 there's no option to select all or select a folder. You have to click every file to select it. Time consuming to say the least.<br />2 there's no cancel button to stop current transfer<br />3 there's no overwrite confirmation  in case you transfer the same file twice.<br />4 even though you paid for it, it constantly pops up a nag to rate and share with your friends.<br />5 it fails on some photos without telling you which one, claiming a network error as if it lost connection with the other device, which isn't true.<br />I recommend using a file manager with network share capability and simply copy ans paste your files.
B000001FMC|5.0|After hearing Swing Out Sister in concert this summer at NightTown in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, I found that its signature album of &#34;It's Better to Travel&#34; still can hold its own among today's jazz contemporaries. In fact, the SOS live performance was an experience right out of the recording studio. I only have praise for the signature album and its standing among jazz greats.
0345495004|5.0|Admire Wrights work but surprised how he really was in life. Told in a great style honestly. Never knew about the fire set on his home/office and tragedy. How didn't I know THAT?  The man was a genius but certainly TILDED. Might not have had the interest if not in the interior design business but think anyone that loves and admires his works would and should read this with a smile.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I am 53 years old.i don't even listen to the radio. but I love the first 3 seasons of glee
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This a thrilling, funny, pull-your-hair-out-in-suspense show anchored by the astonishing and charismatic performance of lead actress Tatiana Maslany (who was robbed of an Emmy nomination, by the way). It's best to plunge into the show knowing as little about it as possible, so I'll keep this short. The first episode is eerie, dark, and a little more slow-paced than the rest of the season; it's also - for plot-related reasons I'm unable to reveal here - a little less weird. So if you find yourself thinking, &#34;Eh, that was okay, but I've got more compelling TV to watch,&#34; just trust me, you're wrong. Give it to the third episode: if you're not hooked after that, let it go.<br /><br />Also, Tatiana Maslany has incredible hair.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it good for kids and get you to want to play everyday has no problems with freezing or anything I would recommend it
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I actually regret that I didn't finish it. It was a slow burn, hobbled by the fact that it felt like we'd seen the premise play out before, and that the characters continually insisted on doing exactly the opposite of what they needed to do to protect themselves. But I went to bed that night feeling super creeped out (which is a good thing!) and I later read the plot summary on Wikipedia (no spoilers!) and I wish I'd finished it. I think it would have scared the bejeezus out of me.<br /><br />So, in sum, I can't 100% recommend you buy this movie, but if you do buy it, FINISH IT.
0765325950|5.0|I was very excited that the final book was here. I started to read it and then after a few minutes I stopped. At that moment I realized that it had been almost 2 decades since I read the first book and all of the subsequent books in the series as they came out.  With this being said I decided to re-read the series from the beginning. The series was better the second time. There were many parts of the series that tied back to earlier books that I hadn't caught the first time through.  Then I got to the final book.... It was good, kept a fair pace, and didn't leave any threads unresolved. The problem for this book is the same problem for all good series; how do you finish when everyone wants to get to the end to see what happens, but, the same people that want it over would like to read just a few more books just to see their favorite characters develop just a little more. Good book, glad I started the series.
B009CGARZG|5.0|One of my favorite movies of my teenage years. Looks great in HD and sounds awesome.<br />Buying on Amazon instant worked like a charm.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|The SuperTooth Buddy was a snap to pair with my phone, my caller's voice is loud and clear, callers can hear my voice easily, it is simple to operate, easy to install and very inexpensive. It holds a charge a long time, and can be charged with a Kindle charger or the included car charger. Family members are so impressed that I have just ordered three more. Out of perhaps half a dozen bluetooth devices over the years this one is the best and by far the cheapest.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I cannot get enough. This show is addictive and makes you keep wanting more. The sets and costumes are brilliant and the acting is the best I have seen on a television show in a while! I cannot wait for season 4!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game, just need more levels. Awesome! It's very challenging and keeps you guessing. A good brain teaser. Thank you
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|The whole family is geared up waiting for season 3.  We even rewatch Season 1 & 2 in anticipation.  The actors and actresses are so good.....the characters they play are so interesting.  We watched 'modern' vs 'tradition' and love love love Maggie's role as the matriarch of the family.....<br />And then what happens.....oh yeah...if something good happens, something very evil must happen; and not just once but twice...and what's left ?...No details.  I don't want to give it away but then I should so others don't watch it....my son and his wife were so totally bummed that they are not ever going to watch it again.  My husband and I then proceeded and I had to take some time off because of grief #1 and then the 'finale'.....did the writers forget that we love these characters and without them...the show just isn't the same.  Also, is there no imagination left to continue a story...if that's what happened then Season 2 should have been the end.  We are all disgusted with Season 3 and the lack of imagination and the removal of the 'heart' of the story.  If the writers would ask me, I would tell them that it isn't tragedy that makes a good show...it is the characters...we are interested in the characters and all the actors and actresses were playing their parts excellently.  They make the story.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Really tired of poorly tested apps being released too soon.  Had issues with it locking up, not opening, etc.  Tried to download it to reset it, and it won't download.  Also had the issue with the famous little green ball which means you're screwed.  Not worth the frustration.  Sadly, if this worked like it should it would be the best version of the game I've played.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, free game.  Not overly challenging and short but very cool for a free game.  This is a great game for Point and Click Adventure game lovers and lovers of puzzle games alike.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Good product for lower doors to floor. Not big enough for my wood floor. If you have carpet this will work
B000VSFPOM|5.0|It is an interesting allegory. We need to protect our flower. Some young readers will find it hard to understand. The book is in easy to read print with graphics.
B00CHMBQRA|3.0|The Bourne movies were tremendously successful, so it's no wonder there have been a spate of wannabes. This is a very watchable film but, at the end of the day, it doesn't rise above he fray.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart) is ex-CIA now working with a a security firm in Brussels to troubleshoot their products. He comes up with an odd finding regarding patents. Now he finds the office he reported to is gone as though it never existed. No recent record of him exists and soon he finds himself on the run with his daughter and fighting for his life.<br /><br />The beginning of this movie is actually very good. You get to see Eckhart as an adviser, his testing of products and the results he gives to his superiors give the viewer an insider's view of what the high stakes security industry involves. When he starts asking questions though you know something's afoot. Then, when his co-workers begin showing up dead, and he hightails it with his daughter, it devolves into a rather typical cat and mouse outing. The Belgium settings give it that 'international intrigue' bit of flavor and help show off Eckhart's ability to move and make things happen. This is shot well, acted well enough (Eckhart isn't digging deep here) and generally well executed all the way around. The story moves at an even clip and much of it makes sense (save for the cheesy, terrible ending) but it has some tough acts to follow. You don't put Lucifer's Friend on stage after Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />This is a steady, entertaining watch. But after it's ended you won't be rushing in for a second viewing.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is a true soul sister to those of us who feel undervalued by the mainstream, a voice for the not-really-ugly but alternately intelligent and hilarious ducklings inside us all. Her honest account of her childhood, its literal and figurative scars, her journeys and ascendance to the comedy throne through improv is at times side-splitting, and at other times groan-inducing, but always authentic, original, candid, and the funny best friend we all both need for ourselves and aspire to be for others.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My wife and I loved this movie, we rented it on instant video and then we loved it so much we went and purchased the DVD. The movie is really funny, the minions are so cute and just make us laugh. The story is good and keeps your attention. We can not wait to see the second one. If you are a fan of anitmated movies or just looking for a good laugh this is a perfect choice.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I tried to download this game twice. The first time, no dice, but I got it to go the second time and I ACTUALLY played it for a couple of days. I was getting really good at it too until a few days ago it just up and shut down on me all together. I tried to open it a dozen times because I really did like the game when it worked properly. I uninstalled it. I am very disappointed. Oh and I have a kindle Fire HD in case you are wondering which device it is not working on.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was a fun, easy read!  I learned a lot about Tina Fey and the comedy business in addition to a lot of laughs ;)
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The product works very well. The phone charges fast. I used it with Samsung S3. Earlier the rate of discharge was higher than the rate of charge while using GPS and bluetooth(for music) while driving. But now, the rate of charge is greater. I am happy with the product.

B0031QVW2U|1.0|This is such a simple thing that the $16 price tag borders on extortion.  Luckily there are alternatives.  Just search \\"underarm strap\\" in Amazon.  I found a similar looking Gino brand strap for only $3.84 with free shipping from Hong Kong.  Since this strap is not directly supporting the camera's weight, I don't see any quality difference being that important.
159514188X|5.0|I though this book, this was simple and heartfelt and as the book goes on I could tell why she was losing control. And why she wanted this boy to listen to the tape. I wish there was more insight into about depression and suicided and not so much the drama but I liked it. And I would read it again. =)
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Pleasant story.  The voices are annoying and the acting amateurish.  Fortunately you can skip the dialogue.  The scenery  is beautiful sand the games fun,  if not a bit hard for my old eyes to see on my Nexus  screen.

For an album to listen to straight through from beginning to end, Life for Rent has few equals. Dido's voice is as clear and melodious as any I have heard. It's simply a pleasure to listen to her. Her lyrics are a cut above as well -- thoughtful, even clever, not just routine pop stuff.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I liked this book for the strong character buildup and good storyline. This was true to the style of writing I have come to expect from GILLIAN FLYNN. the book keeps you turning groves unable to put it down.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this app works on my Kindle Fire. I frequently have trouble falling asleep. Very stressful job. This thing has been a life saver!  I put on the headphones and am out in a matter of minutes. Not sure about the binaural beats feature...if the research supports it or not, but &quot;hey&quot; it seems to work for me and that's all that matters. Like the &quot;favorites&quot; feature and the fact that you can create your own and save them. Not perfect, but has really helped me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome,would recommend to anyone who has read any of the other books in this sequel. Go get it now while you can!
B001BTG3OQ|1.0|I received this product fine. The packaging was good; however, when I finally tried the flash, it have me the indicator that the bulb was burned out. Never buying from this seller again. I do not recommend this seller especially if you're buy pricey products.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first section a while back and found it thought-provoking and engaging. I saw the further sections as they came up and decided to wait until they were all available. I'm glad I waited! It would have been painful to wait for each one to come out....<br /><br />The setting is original, which is hard to do these days. The characters are not two-dimensional, which is a relief. The story arc makes sense and there are enough twists to keep you wondering.<br /><br />Now I need to try some of his other work!
B004USRKX8|5.0|I had an old scratched lp version and loved it. Now I finally have a clean sounding cd. What a talented bunch of artist involved here: members of CSNY, The Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Joni Mitchell etc.<br /><br />Surely recorded in a hazy of drugs and alcohol that has been a serious problem for Crosby but the sound is mellow and honest. It speaks to the talent and closeness of the group, who one can imagine singing together around a beach bonfire at Big Sur.<br /><br />This is a great album to mellow out to, like some of the best James Taylor's old stuff.<br /><br />Enjoy the trip!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|this was a perfect fit for my Kindle. Thank you so much.<br />I charges it up when I plug it in
B00B69UQJY|4.0|I really like DM and find their music intoxicating. Not every album and not every song, but they have cornered the market on Electrogoth. They are fantastic in concert.<br /><br />There are some instant classics here like Welcome to my World and Heaven (which is seemingly a simple chord progression...). The album is produced by Ben Hiller and mixed by Flood (U2) so you know the sound is rich and you can feel Gahan's voice throb in your stomach.<br /><br />My only criticism is that they have decided not to add much guitar to the mix. I enjoyed what they did on the albums that came out after Violator. Maybe they wanted to get back to their original style.<br /><br />Good stuff, especially when you consider the competition.
B00BB8Q1RQ|3.0|Thought the acting was really good but I should have known how a liberal agenda would be pushed when I saw the producers name Harvey Weinstein at the beginning.  I couldn't finish the whole movie out of disgust about the abortion issue.  At least they did refer to it as a \\"baby\\" and not a \\"clump of cells\\" or \\"tumor\\" or \\"parasite.\\"  But to ask someone if they want to keep this baby and if no then just kill it, easy, done, no problem!  The girl had the abortion and at certain points I kept thinking it looked like it was going to portray how depression usually sets in as she kept looking like that at times, but no, they show her happily going on her way with no problem whatsoever with what she had done.<br /><br />What's desperately needed is a producer to make a movie about the many options a woman has besides murder, options that are a lot safer and emotionally easier especially later in life.  A movie that portrays doing the right thing for everyone involved.  A movie about the value of human life, regardless whether they're still in the womb or out.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Alot of different family members you have to remember how each connects. So if you like stories that bounce from one person to another in a story you will like this book.
B0007939NO|4.0|What can I say? I'm a Gene Kelly Fan. Lots of great dancing and music.  Not much acting but the story was a good background for the performers.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it. Got it on shark week and it has been amazing.Would recommend it for anyone. Go shark week!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love the updated version. i recommend it to anybody who is having a tuff time trying to find a good app that you don't have to pay for.
0887307280|5.0|classic,<br />provide helpful information for business owners, no matter how experience we are, ready this book can always help us to find new ideas to improve my business
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Overall it was a great movie.  I am a fan of Colin Firth and thought he did a great job.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I really liked the practical examples used, the descriptions of actual relationships with different couples, anyone can relate to these scenarios. Inciting and very interesting.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I like the feature that brings the battery up and displays the level of charge when you plug it in.
0064471837|4.0|Other fantasy lovers read this book and had a hard time with some of the plot points. \\"It dwells too much on death\\", \\"it comes in feeling like we should already know the story\\", etc. Let me be the first to say that I bought this book in seventh grade (about 1998) and it has held up gloriously over the last fifteen years. (I bought a hardcover copy in the spring, hoping that it will last another fifteen to twenty years!)<br /><br />I remember picking \\"Sabriel\\" up at a book fair and thinking that it had an intriguing cover. There was no description on the back, which was annoying--especially since I'd never heard of Garth Nix back then. But I took my chances and it was well worth it. Magic, the Dead, mysteries locked in a nearly abandoned kingdom for at least two hundred years...and you say \\"Sabriel\\" is BORING?! I recall that before I was even a quarter of the way into it, I was crowing to my favorite English teacher about how magnificent it was--never mind the fact that it was my first (nearly) 500-page book!<br /><br />Although \\"Sabriel\\" is not my favorite book in the series (that honor goes to the Clayr-filled \\"Lirael\\"), it is--without a doubt--an integral part. It's possible that \\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsen\\" could stand on their own, but it's so much more enlightening to have \\"Sabriel\\" available to explain the nuances of the Charter and what exactly an Abhorsen does.<br /><br />Is \\"Sabriel\\" \\"high fantasy\\"? No dragons, no unicorns, no scheming wizards (not in the traditional sense on the latter, anyway). Is it a door that opens onto a path leading into an unexplored world filled with monsters, magic and a tough, newly-minted high school graduate saving her father's life? Absolutely. I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for \\"Clariel\\" to be released in September 2014...as I have since it was announced in 2011 or so.<br /><br />Some other \\"NixNerds\\" have cemented their loyalty by getting charter tattoos. Me? I was the one who chose the less painless route of adding two Clayr names when I legally changed mine in 2007.<br /><br />I remain: Dayanara SANAR RYELLE ;)names when I legally changed mine in 2007.<br /><br />I remain: Dayanara SANAR RYELLE ;)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've enjoyed this app, but sometimes it freezes and then freezes the kindle fire as well causing me to restart the kindle. The ads that pop up are also irritating and do not match the wholesome-ness of the game. Other than that it's great fun.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised as I was looking for something to hold me over until True Blood Season 5/6 came out on DVD. I treat myself to DVDs in order to watch them over in case I should miss something. It's a lot more relaxing to watch them on your own time too. The show is well cast and keeps you guessing. Love that. Superb action, acting, costumes and props for the modern horror fan while managing to maintain the classic wolfman genre. Actors & actresses are all what you would call hot. But their talent is what is so amazing. Derek is the epitome of what (I think) a wolfman should be. Aaaaaaaaaahrooooooooooo! Pure entertainment!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Mix house and alias, add eye candy, remove killing and vicodin, and shake well.  Lots of strong, well developed characters and story lines that make you think.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|My interest in life after death is driven by my spirituality.  I have always been a fundamental  Christian.  This is the fifth book on NDE s that I have read.  Dr. Alexander's experience has been the most compelling.  I have always believed that there is a state of consciousness that is beyond dreaming.  I have felt it without being able to explain it.  I know it is genuine, just as surely as Dr. Alexander's experiences were genuine.<br />I recommend it.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. It makes you think. always good in a sci-fi. there is a lot of recycling of old scripts these days but Oblivion was a new concept and was a very refreshing watch. recommended.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|This collection I have been reading non-stop, you get lost in the  multiple story's going on, and your mind is blown by the end of queen of the damned. Worth staying up late to read, and getting places early to have 15 minutes of reading time.
B00338QENI|4.0|At times especially the middle drags a bit because the family has suffered so much and so much pain and anger doesn't make for a fast-moving story. However, this book raises a lot of stimulating tough questions about science and research and it's also a tender tale of a daughter discovering the mom she's missed so deeply. Both moving and infuriating. Well done.
B00076OMW4|5.0|This is probably my favorite recording of the New World Symphony, and the CSO under Fritz Reiner really did the music justice.  I have a well-worn vinyl disc of this work, and have to say the SACD version sounds better than I remember the vinyl ever sounding.  If you love classical music, you might want to hear how good some of these old warhorses can sound through a high definition medium.  Granted, the engineers had a great sound to begin with, but they did an excellent job of transferring this to SACD DSD.  Highly recommended.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Best game ever it's so awesome. I love it. Try this game it's so very awesome my sister love's it.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|I don't know how many copies of this work I have, a couple on CD but most on LP.  My favorite is the Reiner with the Chicago Symphony, but I've owned it since RCA first issued the vinyl and it's getting pretty worn.  So I'm upgrading some of the music that's near and dear, and this SACD DSD is superbly done.  Great playing and great sound with a perfect hall perspective.  I love this work, and BMG's engineers did a good job of transferring this piece to the little silver disc.  I think all the &#34;Living Stereo&#34; LP's were three channel recordings, so if you listen to these in 5 or 7 channel mode you won't have any surround or back channel information.  The recording is so good, though, that I really didn't notice -- the sound just fills the room, and it's great sound.  This is some of the best sounding violin I've heard outside of the concert hall.  Highly recommended.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I love this book, I've read it at least five times. I'm in middle school, but the first time I read it was in the 2nd grade. Being a more mature student, I'd suggest it for maybe say 4th grade in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I am having fun playing this game with the children...... I play even when they are<br />not around :)<br />I would definitely recommend it to my friends
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|VERY ADDICTIVE AT FIRST I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PARS WERE AND THEN I STARTED GETTING THE HANG OF<br />IT.....REELLY COOL GAME..I BROUGHT TH  FULL VERSION!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I would mostly recommend this book to preteens entering middle school.<br />I liked this book because of the action and the details the author put into it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I both like this game! There is so many things you can do with your horse or horse's
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was lucky enough to score one of these early on, with the free 3 month netflix trial. $35 for the chromecast,  minus 3 x $7.99 netflix is a cost of just $11.  - Brilliant.<br /><br />I should mention this was a short lived offer, and no longer available.<br /><br />Anyway, it arrived last night, and this is a first look review.<br /><br />Box - nice small square box and sleeve, contains the Chromecast, an HDMI extension (about 3 to 4\\" - In case your TV has an awkward HDMI port), USB to Micro USB cable plus a power adapter, and some instruction.<br /><br />It's an HDMI dongle that plugs straight into the TV. Nice and simple (unfortunately it also requires power - wouldn;t it be fantastic it was also powered by HDMI too!). My TV happens to have a powered USB port, so I'm able to power it without unsightly wiring. Very neat little device.<br /><br />I used a PC with chrome browser to set it up, and connect it to my network. - just go to the website that's displayed on your TV on the chromecast channel. Chrome will download the widget / app that you need.<br />Very easy to set up - you will need the WIFI password to your network.<br />I did try to do this first directly from my Iphone, I was unable to get it to work via this method. - But via PC it was a breeze.<br /><br />Once installed I was able to hit the \\"Google Cast\\" button that is now in my browser, and it displays directly to the TV.<br />So anything you can view in a browser, I think you can have on the TV - ie HBO GO  etc.<br /><br />Right now there are few apps available, netflix being the largest. - but others have hinted at being compatible soon - redbox, hulu, pandora to name a few.<br />Being a bit more of an open platform than Apple, I think we will see some interesting things quickly.<br /><br />I then pulled my nexus 7 out, and that was also an easy install. - download the chromecast app, and then netflix, movies etc were able to be played from the internet.<br />Seems the main difference form appletv, is that the nexus is not sending/mirroring the info, but your content is being pulled directly to the chromecast from the cloud. ie I had a movie that came with the Nexus 7 - Transformers, I have previously deleted it. - It started to play directly on the chromecast, and left the nexus as a remote.<br /><br />So far, I like it, I will likely buy a few more for the other TV's in the house.- I mean, I can buy 3 for the cost of 1 apple TV. Great
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I've read and reread this book a few times. Every time it ends I'm sad. Love love love this book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OMG i love this game!! The minions are so cute!! Fun for everyone &lt;3&lt;3  I would 100% absoluetly recommend this game to anyone!!
B009PMB3CI|5.0|I think that this game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!I think that if they included a few more features such as, picking different breeds than this would be the perfect game!!!!!!! I don't quite understand the music part, but overall this is a great game for someone who has lost a pet.
B0052HLSHA|5.0|Although the movie has too much violence, it is based on an interesting idea. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it. B. Cooper does a great job of changing from a failure into Mr. Success. For sure, with all the designer drugs out there, someone is trying to make a drug like this one. The story takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride and that is why I watch movies. DiNiro does a great job, too.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have allwase loved my little and theism was a big the In the my little pony world (next to the movie) I just love the game!!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Family members and friends have been talking about Game of Thrones for years now. I was just sure I would not like it because, as a rule, I never care for fantasy. However, I got a premium channel for free and decided to watch episode l of the first year. I was hooked and watched the entire season in one day. Needless to say, housework and cooking did not get done that day.<br /><br />I've ask myself, Why is this so good? Characters, action, setting, suspense--it just all works. Cannot wait for the next season, but I will have to.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I bought this movie for myself for Christmas.  I thought it was the best of the Transformers movie.  The action was unbelievable and kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was terrific and a must-see.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|This movie is not for everyone. It is definitely not escape fiction; topics are way too heavy for a fun night at the cinema. Clooney does a good job of appearing to be a man who has been somewhat of a failure as a husband and father. He has definitely passed the sex pot, leading man role and seems to have embraced roles that fit his age and station in life. His character's life takes a hard turn and he is forced to cope with what is left. I absolutely hated the character played by the Bridges brother, but loved the setting. Kind of an odd movie. Not one I would totally recommend, but am glad i saw it.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|I bought this book for my stepdaughter for her birthday.  She has read all of Alice Sebold's books and really seemed to love them all, especially The Lovely Bones.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I Love this show!  It hasn't lost any appeal to me in the Six seasons, and I can't wait to get this on DVD.  Yes I saw the series on T.V. but I want to have a marathon and watch it again!  SPOILER to those who haven't seen it... Sheldon spanking Amy! I about died I laughed so hard!!!!<br /><br />Can't wait for Sept!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have read the first two novels that Mr. Hosseini has published and they were excellent reads.  This one was a little difficult to follow and the author assumed that when he changed time and places in the novel that the reader were be able to keep up.  I did but it was not a good flowing read if you know what I mean.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Loved this game would have liked this to be free and buy additional levels. My hope is that as new levels are introduced they will be free. I hope I'm not asked to pay more.<br />Puzzles are challenging yet not impossible. Loved the music too. Very well designed interface.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My is better but next up is this it is my second favorite game i n American it is rqelly fun
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Strange movie but I liked it after I got into it.  The boy/tiger reminded me of Tom Hanks/Wilson in Shipwreck.
0375842209|5.0|The written word as a symbol of resistance to oppressive Nazi rule is the principal theme of this powerfully written historical novel. The involved third party narrator, in the person of death, tells the story of Liesel, an orphan living with a poor family in a small town close to Munich, the heart of Nazi power. Liesel's compulsion to read, and to steal books to do so, is an act of defiance against the written propaganda efforts of the Nazis. The family also honors an earlier promise by harboring a fugitive Jew, also an act of defiance in the face of omnipresent danger. Consistent with the main theme of the story, the fugitive writes stories for Liesel. They become friends and find solace and inspiration through their shared love of reading and writing.<br /><br />Death as the narrator provides a unique but wholly appropriate perspective. Unique because he summarizes plot lines at the beginning of each chapter and uses major foreshadowing to reveal the ultimate fates of major characters. The overall structure of the book is established so one can concentrate on character development and the manner in which the story line is resolved. Appropriate narrator? Yes, after all, this is wartime and he is very busy transporting the souls of the departed.<br /><br />There are so many accolades for this novel as an \\"important book\\" that one approaches it with some reluctance; you must read this because it's \\"good for you.\\" Despite all that, once engaged I found myself unable to put down what is at its most basic, a well written page turner brimming with suspense, irony, humor(yes), inspiration, and ultimately life affirming tragedy.<br /><br />This is a novel that not only has a lingering impact, but one that also affects your mood during the reading experience. That's indeed high praise. And yes, you will cry.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Many shows are great through season 5 -- then initial writing contracts expire and the shows take a turn.  Big Bang Theory is still excellent.  While we know the characters -- they still surprise and hold our interest.  Great show.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game. There were several challenging moves which made you think. I love these type of thought provoking games. I could play them for hours on end.
1416562605|5.0|This is one of the books where the story's so wacky, you just can't put it down! And I didn't until it was over
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|This game is fun to play, but once you run out of irons, you have to buy more at a cost of $19.99,<br />so I only gave it one star
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This is an amazingly smooth, deceptively simple one-button side scrolling platformer that has you controlling Rayman as he runs through various levels using his skills (jump, hover, wall run and jump and punch) to collect Lums (yellow sun-like creatures along the path.) Anyone can play as the game runs on its own and the button for jump, fly, punch, etc is the same one so even young children can button mash their way to completed levels. But for those of us who like challenges, there are multiple paths based on timed jumps to collect Lums (or not) to get up to three stars at the end of the level. This is a really fun game for people of all ages.<br /><br />NOTE: this game plays well on all operating systems (in case you have Windows or iPhone). I bought this for Windows Phone 8 (on sale for $0.99 this week) and it plays exactly the same as on Android and iOS. Very well made game.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great story of a family separated by tragic circumstances and how the connections continue in spite of physical separation.  The perspective of the little boys toward the end of the story is especially powerful.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My 4 year old daughter loves it. I however am quite disappointed that Gameloft requires real money to purchase some ponies and that trophies are earned through social network. I think this game would be more enjoyable if it was actually geared towards kids and not towards a parent's pocketbook.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Just downloaded the game and played for awhile.  Not real challenging but a fun way to pass the time.  Great for de-stressing after working in a doctor's office all day.
0812975219|5.0|Using his trademark aphoristic bent, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: \\"Arrogance in persons of merit affronts us more than arrogance in those without merit: merit itself is an affront\\".  I've come to realize that some people find Nassim Taleb's arrogance quite repugnant, but, personally, I find it rather charming.  I suspect that the same people who find Taleb's arrogance off-putting are the people who wish they possessed a shred of his erudition.  Nietzsche was certainly on to something; it's hard to avoid being offended by your betters.<br /><br />I think I first read \\"Fooled By Randomness\\" circa 2006.  Recently, I felt a longing to reread Taleb's first non-technical book again.  Wow, what a wise decision that was!  I actually digested more from the rereading than I did from the initial reading (and I digested quite a bit from the first reading).  Both times, I focused on reading the book very, very slowly.  Obviously, the fact that I spent the time to reread this book is indicative of how valuable I think it is.<br /><br />Known for his great wit, the baseball pitcher Vernon Louis \\"Lefty\\" Gomez was fond of saying that, \\"I'd rather be lucky than good.\\"  This phrase, in essence, is one of the central themes of the book.  Although it sounds like a hackneyed platitude, Gomez, understood the role of randomness in our lives.  However, due to myriad biases, we humans often tend to attribute our successes to our skill and blame bad luck for our failures.  Is your rich neighbor or your boss really as skilled as she thinks she is?<br /><br />Parts of the book are also about the hindsight bias and the narrative fallacy.  We humans are great at fabricating post hoc narratives about our world.  It's how we understand (and misunderstand) the world, but we must remember not to take our stories too seriously.  \\"A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact,\\" writes Taleb, \\"but in the light of the information until that point.\\"<br /><br />One of Taleb's favorite philosophers is Karl Popper.  However, Taleb wasn't always enthralled with the man who espoused the beauty of empirical falsification.  Prior to rediscovering the great philosopher, Taleb went through a self identified anti-intellectual phase early in his career as a trader.  He feared becoming a corporate slave with \\"work ethics\\" (a term which he interprets to mean inefficient mediocrity).  \\"Philosophy, to me,\\" Taleb writes, \\"became something rhetorical people did when they had plenty of time on their hands; it was an activity reserved for those who were not well versed in quantitative methods and other productive things.  It was a pastime that should be limited to late hours, in bars around the campuses, when one had a few drinks and a light schedule -- provided one forgot the garrulous episode as early as the next day.  Too much of it can get a man in trouble, perhaps turn one into a Marxist ideologue.\\"  As they say, the dose determines the poison.<br /><br />Speaking of poison, another interesting idea that Taleb espouses is that being too attached your beliefs is poisonous.  As he puts it: \\"Loyality to ideas is not a good thing for traders, scientists, -- or anyone\\".  I like to think about it this way, there are times we shouldn't trust experts precisely because they are experts.  This is because they are no incentives to be brutally critical of your own ideas.  A scientist or a preacher who has built their career on a certain idea obviously has a lot invested in that idea.  How likely are they to be critical of their own position when their livelihood depends on it being accepted?  What if they are putting out pseudo-scientific nutritional guidelines that cause harm, but help them keep their job?<br /><br />According to Popper there are only two types of theories:<br /><br />1) Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected (he calls them falsified).<br />2) Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong.<br /><br />If you accept Popper's epistemology, like I also do, you can never claim that you know a theory to be true.  In other words, we can only gain knowledge through proving that things are false.  For instance, when I accidentally find myself in a theistic debate, people often challenge me to tell them how the universe came into existence.  When I say `I don't know', they become infuriated.  How dare I have the gall to dismiss some of their religion's claims as not true without projecting my own claim to reality?  Yet, that's exactly the point.  I gain knowledge through knowing what's wrong, not through making claims about what I think is right.<br /><br />So what should we make of Taleb's extreme and obsessive Popperism in a more practical sense?  How does he recommend we apply to it our lives?  I think it can be summarized in the following passage:<br /><br />I speculate in all of my activities on theories that represent some vision of the world, but with the following stipulation: No rare event should harm me.  In fact, I would like all conceivable rare events to help me.  My idea of science diverges with that of the people around me walking around calling themselves scientists.  Science is mere speculation, mere formulation of conjecture.<br /><br />The following thought experiment really helped me internalize this message.  Assume you participate in a gambling game that has  999/1000 chance of winning $1 [Event A] and a 1/1000 chance of winning $10,000 [Event B].  Using some straightforward calculations the expectation of a loss is roughly $9 (multiply the probabilities by the outcome for each event and then sum them)  Which event would you bet on?  I suspect that most people consider the frequency or probability in their decision, but this is totally irrelevant.  According to Taleb, even people like MBAs and economists with some statistical training fail to understand this point.  The magnitude of the outcome should be the only relevant factor in the decision.  Think of a trader who focuses on event B, sure, he is likely to bleed slowly for long periods of time, but when the rare event happens the payoff is astronomical compared to the losses.  Most of us, however, are schooled in environments that focus on games with symmetrical outcomes (e.g., a coin toss).  The great psychologist and father of behavioral economics, Daniel Kahneman, also reminds us that we are loss averse and psychologically struggle with idea of bleeding out small losses for extended periods of time, even if there is eventually the opportunity for a huge payday.<br /><br />Once you realize that life is full of scenarios with asymmetrical payoffs, you're thinking (if you're anything like me anyway) will be permanently altered.  In fields like, say, writing, the outcomes are asymmetrical.  In other words, there is not a linear relationship with the number of hours spent writing and the amount of income one makes.  One may spend a long time writing for free and then finally catch a huge book deal.  For me, this is somewhat of a moot point because I'd write for free without any other justification other than the fact that it's fun and makes me happy.

Most of us, however, are schooled in environments that focus on games with symmetrical outcomes (e.g., a coin toss).  The great psychologist and father of behavioral economics, Daniel Kahneman, also reminds us that we are loss averse and psychologically struggle with idea of bleeding out small losses for extended periods of time, even if there is eventually the opportunity for a huge payday.    Once you realize that life is full of scenarios with asymmetrical payoffs, you're thinking (if you're anything like me anyway) will be permanently altered.  In fields like, say, writing, the outcomes are asymmetrical.  In other words, there is not a linear relationship with the number of hours spent writing and the amount of income one makes.  One may spend a long time writing for free and then finally catch a huge book deal.  For me, this is somewhat of a moot point because I'd write for free without any other justification other than the fact that it's fun and makes me happy.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|First off, I love this series!  I believe out of all my DVDs this series is my favorite and I have to put my Miss Potter DVD second which I truly admire and if you love tradition and any history you will really like this DVD.<br />The men and women in our family love this DVD.  My husband listens to it while he is playing on the computer which I find very funny!  And I have to say that he is the one who told me when to expect the Fourth Downton Abbey to come out!  He has been snooping online to find out!<br />Considering the English history, these series describes in detail how the aristocracy started to have a heart and how the under class seemed to emerge with some success.<br />The suspense on how these people stick up for each other and stick it to each other is incredible.  I love every character, the actors, Mr. Fellowes and everyone of the DA staff have done such an incredible job.  Most of all, it is a decent movie to put on in front of children and family.<br />I have purchased several complete sets of these DVDs for my family as gifts.  And we are as swept away with this show and look forward at family social functions just to discuss what will happen next.<br />I am all over the road with this write up but I love the Downton Abbey series and I think that anyone who purchases it will not be disappointed.  But by all means purchase Downton Abbey, then DA Season 2 before you purchase Season 3 first so you can be caught up with the rest of us!!!!

B005CWRB44|5.0|I had this flashlight for about 2 years now.  It's bright enough but does not drain the battery. There are a few complains that you have to uncrew the head a little more to prevent it from turning on.  It is true but in order to turn it on \\"accidentally\\" you really need to press it in really hard.  This is not a flaw for me. It has a steady enough beam for its size.  It's water resistant,  I completely dipped it in water and switched the modes.  Main reason I have it is because of the size,  I have it on my keychain with micro multitool and its not too bulky.

0316066524|5.0|Early on during my attendance at the University of Montana in Missoula, I attempted to read this book. I had been impressed by the phonebook-esque length, the tiny, crimped font, and enticing plot described on the back ever since I spotted it on a shelf at Hastings during my high school years. My copy had been purchased in 2006, the ten-year anniversary of the book's publication, and it had been marked down to $10 versus the typical $16 price tag; it had also been stamped as a special &#34;anniversary copy.&#34;<br /><br />Sadly, a few pages in, I just didn't get it and resigned, eventually giving away that particular edition to a local used bookstore. The narrative described a plethora of details that seemed unnecessary to the plot (what plot? har-har) and I stopped reading once I encountered a sentence that made zero sense to me: &#34;I would yield to the urge to bolt for the door ahead of them if I could know that bolting for the door is what the men in this room would see.&#34; Like, huh? What else would they see, Dave? I just couldn't bring myself to read another word. The book had already stopped playing by one of my cardinal rules, which was to always make sense to the reader, always.<br /><br />In a couple of years, things changed. Because of my college English lit classes, I was soon subjected to a barrage of mind-melting literature capable of completely changing the way I looked at fiction, especially the one-two punch of massive prose bricks Ulysses and Gravity's Rainbow, both of which had been paired with separate books written by scholars just devoted to explain the avalanche of random references and symbols. It soon became apparent to me that just because a book didn't always make sense or hit the usual narrative notes, it didn't always mean that it was an inferior work. Both Ulysses and GR equally frustrated and astounded me depending on which section I was reading, and they both eventually made their way onto my &#34;favorite books&#34; list due to their complexity and inimitable composition.<br /><br />And but so I went ahead and gave IJ another chance. For a college graduation gift, I had received my requested present of a 2nd-generation Kindle. I downloaded a free sample of IJ and found that it was the longest sample Amazon had (and still has) ever sent me - it hit close the 70-page mark in the physical book. I started reading and kept on reading until the end of the sample. Like a spaceship gravitating toward a gaping black hole, unable to turn itself away from the hole's crushing pull, I was compelled to outright buy the book and read the rest of it.<br /><br />I won't bother to waste my words here on the peculiar and sprawling plot, as it frequently defies description (and can be summarized in other reviews here). Same goes for the unconventional structure: most people know about the voluminous collection of footnotes, but there's far more intricacy to it than that. Instead, I will keep it brief and to the absolute essential of what you should know about this book: It is amazing. It really is. Ever since I read it, it still remains the best novel I've ever read. And a lot of people (including those who choose to read it as a part of &#34;Infinite Summer&#34;) feel or will feel the same way.<br /><br />A lot of times, when I read a book for a certain length of time, I start feeling the itch to just hurry up and finish it as soon as possible so I can get onto the next book. It must be an addiction to novelty and newness or something, but it happens with almost every book I read: a desire to read every last word so I can soon stand in front of my bookshelf, twiddling my fingers with glee whilst weighing the options of what I'll read next. With IJ, that never happened. During the three months that it took me to read it, I had the sensation of feeling like 1100 pages were just not enough. With characters and concepts this unique and compelling, I needed at least another 2200 pages, minimum.<br /><br />Oddly enough, even though this is my favorite book as yet, it is by no means perfect. As hinted at by the &#34;bolting for the door&#34; line above, DFW does not always make complete sense and sometimes leaves you scratching your noggin, wondering what he meant. Nor is every single passage golden and hallowed: some sections go on and on to your detriment and consternation (I'm thinking specifically between the long-winded, philosophical conversations in the desert shared between Marathe and Steeply, easily the worst and most boring sections of the book).<br /><br />In addition, the book ends on an apparently random and unsatisfying note, leaving a lot of unresolved plot points and likely serving up a cold helping of dissatisfaction upon the first read-through -- the opposite of the warm and fuzzy feeling avid readers have of closing a book and thinking, &#34;There was absolutely no better way that could have ended.&#34; (I'm planning on reading Chris Hager's lengthy and reference-laden undergrad thesis which defends and explains IJ's ending -- I just recently found it on DFW website &#34;The Howling Fantods,&#34; but I haven't got the time right now to plow through it and underline important points with a pen.)<br /><br />Despite these downsides, however, there is so much stuff that just works: the chilling, deadly methods of the Wheelchair Assassins; Poor Tony Krause's nightmarish drug detox in a public library bathroom; Joelle Van Dyne's attempted suicide in the bathroom of a party; the apocalyptic Eschaton match; a hilarious description of the rise and subsequent failure of video-phone technology; Gately's robbery and accidental murder of M. DuPlessis early on in the book; and so much more. Joelle, Orin, Mario, Pemulis, John &#34;No Relation&#34; Wayne, and especially my main man Gately are all ranked among my favorite fictional characters ever written.<br /><br />One thing I dislike about some post-modern authors is their apparent clinical detachment from their own characters; while everything is beautifully and eloquently written, I often get a sense of coldness, as though the writers do not feel very much for or through their own characters. In this, there is a heavy lack of what I think of as &#34;heart.&#34; (I sensed this frequently throughout Don Delillo's &#34;White Noise,&#34; whose characters seemed kind of flat and emotionless.)<br /><br />DFW, on the other hand, put so much heart in this particular work that it's sometimes too much to take. Whether it's addressing the pain of addiction, the heartbreak of losing a loved one, the horror of child abuse, or the pure inability to connect with others or experience happiness, it's clear that DFW surely channeled many of his own fears and insecurities through his fictional creations and put much of himself down on the page as a result.<br /><br />In contrast, there are also many parts of the book that are simply and uproariously hilarious. DFW boasted a very sharp and immediate sense of humor along his skills of prosaic manipulation. The edifice of Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House[sic], Don Gately's shrewd but uneducated observations & criminal upbringing, and the overall world of consumerism gone horrifically wrong as encouraged by the rampant rise of corporations are all fertile fields for the novel's more humorous sensibilities. There were many times that IJ brought on a spate of giggling in me so pronounced that I had to just put down the book and allow it to pass before I could continue.<br /><br />Now, be advised that this book is not for everyone. Lord, no. Just because I and others enjoyed it so greatly does not mean that everybody will feel the same way. It's a very challenging and demanding work, and it seems designed for a very particular audience. Anyone hoping for a nicely-defined plot or simple themes will find him-or-herself quickly thwarted. Others looking for some kind of a point to the apparently pointless ramblings of admittedly inconsequential details or conversations that pack hundreds of pages, a lot of them enjoyable but ultimately unimportant to any overarching theme, will also go bananas with vexation.<br /><br />IJ was never designed to nab a Pulitzer or a National Book Award, never designed to go down in the annals of literary greatness as one of those books that speak volumes to whoever reads it over the span of centuries. I think that it will connect most with collegiate types who grew up Gen-X and beyond, the ones who have, as children or young adults, especially experienced the constant bombardment of unconscious marketing by huge conglomerates, as well as the ubiquity of &#34;the entertainment&#34; whether through television and video cassettes or (later on) DVDs and the Internet. Anyone who has grown up in this age of easy access to non-stop stimulation will likely understand what DFW intended to lambaste with this particular book.<br /><br />Now down to brass tacks: I own both the Kindle copy and the regular paperback edition (obtained at a used book sale along with a copy of Michael Chabon's The Yiddish Policeman's Union for a $1, probably the best used book purchase I've ever made). Given the size of this beast, I would heartily recommend the Kindle format for a first-time reader if you've got the appropriate technology. The Kindle version makes flipping back and forth between the main text and the footnotes a breeze, and let's face it, do you really want to lug that huge book around? (Unless maybe you're trying to broadcast to other people what it is that you're reading so you can more easily strike up a conversation with someone who has parallel literary tastes to you, to which I say go right ahead and get the door-stopper, then.)<br /><br />We lost a genius and heartfelt mind in 2008 when Wallace committed suicide, but at the very least, he has left behind this amazing and one-of-a-kind labor of love that continues to inspire and confound the people who read it long after he left us. Not sure if you'll enjoy the book or not? Try downloading the free sample. As far as I know, it's just as long as it was when I first began this massive undertaking, and it'll give you a very good sense of what you're about to experience for the next couple of months. If you're not the intended audience, you can always put the book down. But if you are, you'll find that you too can't stop reading, and your life will likely be as irrevocably changed as mine was by this extraordinary book. Welcome to Infinite Jest.
0871403633|4.0|EOW refers to Paul VI & [[ASIN:0898707285 Humanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI]] (HV) twice. [pp 192, 252-253]<br /><br />In doing so, EOW demonstrates or enacts part of his own thesis about group selection: Group competition often involves stylized exhortation of the Excellent Us vs. the Demonized Them. [See, e.g., pp 57-58] Specifically, in his remarks about HV, EOW is like a politician flattering an appreciative crowd of his own New Secular Science Party while insulting the Old Religious Ignorance Party.<br /><br />Fair enough. However, ...<br /><br />Unfortunately, in his harangues, EOW betrays the values of his own Science Party: accuracy, objectivity & fairness.<br /><br />Specifically,<br /><br />1. After accusing Paul VI of ignorant, unintentional omission of \\"some important factor or other,\\" [p 252] EOW drastically (but unintentionally?) misrepresents Humanae Vitae, virtually chopping it in half; but,<br />2. Ironically, upon examination, what Humanae Vitae has to say about what's good & right in marriage (albeit founded upon entirely different metaphysical grounds) is strikingly similar to EOW's claims.<br /><br />Put differently,<br /><br />1. EOW sets up a silly strawman to insult & rail against, committing the very sins he accused Paul VI of; but,<br />2. Amusingly, the real opponent looks a lot like EOW himself.<br /><br />Those two points I will demonstrate below by: (1) summarizing EOW's caricature of HV; (2) summarizing EOW's own position; & (3) comparing EOW's position to what HV actually says.<br /><br />[It might be useful beforehand to make a short list of what I am NOT arguing, what I am NOT saying:<br /><br />* That EOW's misrepresentations of HV undermine his arguments about group selection.<br />* That either EOW or Paul VI is correct. Or not.<br />* That I am a good Catholic myself.<br />* Etc.]<br /><br />I limit myself to the two points above: (1) EOW gets HV wrong, making the very mistake he says Paul<br />VI made; & (2) EOW's position isn't all that different, practically speaking, from HV.<br /><br />EOW's Caricature of HV<br /><br />EOW paraphrases the reasoning of HV as follows: \\"God, [Paul VI] posited, intends for sexual intercourse to be limited to the purpose of conceiving children.\\" [p 253]<br /><br />Yea, but ... That \\"leaves out a vital fact.\\" [p 253] It involves such an obvious omission that one wonders if EOW has even read HV! [IDK. I guess I'm willing to call it ignorance, an unintentional omission, to use EOW's words.]<br /><br />EOW's Own Position<br /><br />EOW goes on to say: Science, \\"has revealed that there is another, additional purpose to sexual intercourse. ... Both men & women, when bonded, invite continuous & frequent intercourse. The practice is genetically adaptive: it ensures that the woman and her child have help from the father. For the woman, the commitment secured by pleasurable nonreproductive intercourse is important ... [during the] ... long period of [an infants'] helplessness ... [in the] level of support ... she obtains from a sexually and emotionally bonded mate.\\" [p 253]<br /><br />(Although EOW doesn't say so explicitly, one assumes that his description of \\"nonreproductive\\" savannah sex has nothing to do with artificial contraception. [Unclear. IDK what scientists have been unearthing with the spear points, etc.] I assume he's describing a period of infertility when young children are nursing? That is, I think he's describing something like an australopithecine \\"rhythm method?\\")<br /><br />Now, Compare EOW's Position to What HV Actually Says<br /><br />§8 Husband & wife make a mutual gift of themselves, developing the union of two persons (personarum communionem).<br />§9 Which leads to long-term fulfillment of husband & wife. (ut coniuges veluti cor unum et anima una fiant, suamque humanam perfectionem una simul adipiscantur.)<br />§9 And it is also fecund, going beyond itself, leading to new life.<br />§11 On the other hand (obviously), \\"new life is not the result of each and every act of sexual intercourse. ... wisely ordered laws of nature and the incidence of fertility [ensure] that successive births are already naturally spaced through the inherent operation of these laws.\\"<br />§11 In fact, conjugal acts \\"[do] not ... cease to be legitimate even when, for reasons independent of [the couples'] will, it is foreseen to be infertile.\\"<br />§12 Nevertheless, there is an inseparable natural connection between the unititve & procreative significance of conjugal acts. (unitatis et procreationis)<br />§17 Prophecy (looking forward): Without the prospect of procreation, without a prospect of shared child-rearing responsibility, men tend to ignore the dignity of women, to view woman instrumentally.<br />§18 Natural history (looking backwards): We shouldn't so disconnect our understanding of our own lives from the long centuries of our forbears. That is, given our long history, it doesn't make sense to say that real human flourishing, the true human good, has only emerged with a recent technical expedient, a new trick, viz., affordable artificial contraceptives.<br /><br />Bottom line, common ground between EOW & Paul VI: It is a fact of human nature that sex is both unitive & procreative.<br /><br />So what? What difference does it make that EOW did not do justice to Paul VI & HV? Not much.<br /><br />However, a few observations:<br /><br />1. EOW is very clever in choosing his targets. I don't think it's a coincidence that EOW insults the one target, a faithful Roman Catholic, despised by both (a) the old-time Protestant folks back home in Alabama, & (b) the sophisticates in the Ivory Tower. It's not easy to please both those groups at once. In fact, a certain bad attitude about Catholics is probably the only thing they have in common.<br />2. Apparently not one editor at the venerable Norton & Co. had enough knowledge of HV or Catholic moral teaching to see that EOW's statements are silly distortions.

0307477479|5.0|After finishing this book and deciding that it was one of the best novels I'd read in 2012, I perused Amazon's review section, wondering what people thought of it. I was pretty shocked to find a very polarized response. Some people absolutely love it; others despise it and write it off as pretentious dreck. How could one book inspire such a divided response?<br /><br />Personally, I thought Jennifer Egan's \\"A Visit from the Good Squad\\" was a terrific and beautifully-written book. While technically a collection of short stories that can be experienced and enjoyed individually, the book's interconnecting characters and themes culminate together to create something that feels more like a novel - one that comes together in a powerful way, weaving storylines together like a tapestry to communicate a solid message. The constantly-shifting perspectives and jumps in time allowed me to experience the characters' dashed dreams and heartbreaks, everyone eventually ravaged and robbed by time, that greatest and most savage of all thieves and murderers.<br /><br />\\"Visit\\" employs a variety of techniques to tell its stories, mostly relying on straight prose but sometimes getting experimental, including a story written as a footnoted magazine article, as well as the notorious PowerPoint chapter, told as a series of slides complete with text bubbles and graphs. In the latter example, Egan seems to bridge a gap between generations and create a narrative that can potentially appeal to multiple age demographics. The sting of the wounds that time can inflict on a person over the years will more likely resonate in older readers, while the utilization of PowerPoint slides to structure a story may more strongly appeal to a younger person such as myself, who was often mandated to use such computer software in my formative adolescent years.<br /><br />This trans-generational direction happens in other ways, too. Those 40 and above will probably appreciate the depiction of the downfall of analog musical recording and the rise of digital playback, recording more frequently taking place at home and sold as MP3 files instead of in expensive music studios where albums were once immortalized en masse onto vinyl. Conversely, younger folk who grew up in this modern age where marketing execs aggressively and relentlessly target younger and younger audiences will feel the satirical bite Egan takes on toward the end of the novel, when infants are given the power to make their own purchases with electronic devices, now perceived as a major buyer. This concept seems frightening, sad, and just a little too plausible to be written off as a concept restricted to the fictional world.<br /><br />So, yeah, I'm pretty surprised at the mixed response \\"Visit\\" has received. I've read other novels or short story collections way more pretentious and overblown than this one that have gotten a significantly higher star rating. What's the deal? I suppose I won't ever really know, but I will say this: Give this book a shot before you dismiss it based on the varying reviews. You may be one of those people who love it and come to enjoy its place on your bookshelf. (Note: I read the paperback edition. I have read in other reviews that the Kindle version is extremely difficult to read. Consider this before buying.)
B00138CYD4|5.0|I liked this album simply because it has the hits from the radio that I remembered Santata so well for.  This collection is the music that I grew up with.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I absolutely loved this DVD!  I am now a huge Richard Armitage fan.  I have also downloaded and read the ebook.  John Thornton is giving Mr. Darcy a run for his money in my affections.<br /><br />  From a teacher's point of view I can use it in the the classroom to show the impact of the industrial revolution on society, the rise of labor unions, and working conditions.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I really found this movie great even though some people didn't. So what if they use a word that has been around a long time
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is a fun game i want more the puzzles are challenging and most really work your brain and all challenge you
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really a little better than temple run 2.do you think its a little better than temple run 2?  (Yes  or. No)?
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I've read about six Reacher Novels, in no particular order. I liked this one a lot because he was still in the service. It gave me some background for future reading. I gave it four stars, but it deserved 4.5
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Paid for this app but recent updates added adverts. Sorry, love the game but once a company pulls this, I am done. They are never to be trusted again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Weather Bug is ok but I am still grieving for my old Weather Channel app.  I absolutely loved it and checked it several times a day.  I had to delete it though.  It became unrecognizable and indecipherable.  Weather should be simple y'all.  Please bring the old version back!
B005LAII4E|3.0|visual effects were ok but a lot of the plot was very cloudy and was easy to predict,some acting was a bit hammy
0425263916|5.0|This is the second book in the Crossfire Series and it was fantastic. Gideon and Eva are two very likeable characters. Their lives together seem to always be haunted by the past. It is soooo much better than Fifty Shades!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I feel asleep instantly! Even with my grandma's tv blaring! Some of the sounds sound bad in the free version but it was only like two... the new version is great! I suggest getting it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have to say this book is WAY better than the first I cannot wait to see the movie and read the next book!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|In many ways I very much enjoyed this book.  The research is impressive, the theories interesting.  I was never bored.  One thing puzzled me. Initially it seemed that the author would approach the historical Jesus from the perspctive of standard biblical criticism.  The reader is instructed that the authors of Matthew and Luke draw from the book of Mark and a mysterious source known as \\"Q.\\"  Rather than first hand witnesses to the events, these authors depend on earlier religious traditions. How then are we to know the real Jesus?  The author solves this problem by shifting between a mindset of biblical criticism and a fundamentalist of sorts. In places, Jesus is quoted with confidence, absent then are reminders that we are reading pieced together and often undependable early traditions. Mr Aslan presents actual quotes as though we know Jesus said them. Perhaps he did. But that is a matter of faith.  Mr. Aslan does a splendid job giving us historical context. The book presents a persuasive argument that the early church was deeply conflicted.  I found the conflict between James and Paul to be fascinating.  But these conflicts highlight the danger that any of the quotes could be suspect.  Mr. Aslan views Jesus as devoted to the poor.  I share his view, but based upon faith.  While the book includes much wonderful scholarship, I do not see the conclusions as scholarly.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is the best but the big problem is that sometimes when i make a world or load a previous world and people try to join over wifi their world is completely messed up compared to mine... please fix it
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This is a fun 'popcorn' science fiction movie with just enough substance to keep it going.  It's not deeply entrenched with dialog and heavy a plot line.  I wasn't expecting this to be very good but I was quite surprised how much I liked it.  You could get lost in the atmosphere, visually stunning with a sense of isolation.<br /><br />Give it a rental, grab some popcorn and have a good ol' fashion sci-fi for dinner.
B001TOD9VI|4.0|This Movie is very well done and is surely worth the price and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed how Lifes change and his experience helped him find the difference between the two worlds that most people back home don't understand
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|This is a great movie, it is very long but good, Love that it is a Criterion collection version makes it that much better. One of brad Pitt's greatest Roles.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved the entire series. This last installment brought all the loose ends to a satisfyingly dramatic conclusion. Definitely recommend this book!
B001PPGAIK|4.0|It is a very long movie but is well done and worth the buy. Im very glad i bought this movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easeier to read than ay items- a little too big for my mobile device-crowds the screen.  It did rate the scores and that is what I like.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers.  Baldacci is a great writer I like his work as much as Pattersons.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well I love this but I think they should make it so that you can mate animals I need it seriously like. I can't stop. Playing it I love it!!!
B004F57CFW|4.0|I don't like every song on this album but all his hits are here. Great collection of Michael Jackson songs.
B00004RF8J|5.0|this is a funny odd old movie, just needed to add it our collection of movies.  funny movie in a twisted way.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|The Hard Way does not disappoint.  Although the Jack Reacher books are somewhat formulaic, they are always a great read. Lots of suspense and action. I figured out the puzzle before Reacher did, but that made it all the more suspenseful - how would Reacher fix THIS problem?  As usual, Reacher gives the bad guys what they deserve and rescues the women and children- and a couple of men.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Wow!! What a good read this was. Gregory does this type of writing so well. It drags a tiny bit in the first few chapters but as always Ms. Gregory has a way of pulling a reader into the story.<br />I've read many narratives of the war of the roses. This one is somewhat different in that there never appears to be any love between Elizabeth and her husband King Henry VII...I mean NO love. Henry comes across as a man who I really would never like to know let alone be related to!<br />Alot of speculation in this book about the two princes in the tower who disappeared. It appears that this telling supports the fact that one of the princes was smuggled out of the tower by Queen Elizabeth (at the time) and saved for later. Regardless...its sad to think of two small children being killed in that manner.<br />One thing that comes blaringly clear is the relationship between Henry VII and his mother Margaret..its smothering, and chokes the life out of anyone else who comes near them.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|I figured I should watch this movie since I've passed by it for many years. For some reason, it has survived as a cult classic and managed to generate a meme or two. What a turd of a movie. It's one street punk battle after another, set in motion by a weak plot and story. If you think you'll like the aesthetic of this movie, just watch Escape From New York instead. It actually has a story. The Warriors just has sweaty punks posturing and punching, swinging and strutting. This should have been a 30 minute movie at most. It's a shame, too... I thought the opening premise had some potential.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I was very upset with how this book turned out. I was rooting for the main character up until half way through the book. The more and more I read the more frustrated and angry I became. She finally is getting her life together and she has the baby and talks about how beautiful she is and has this unconditional love for her child.So what does she do with this \\"love\\"? She leaves a 2day old baby ALONE in a bassinet twice!!!! Not to even mention that the second time she leaves a new born over night by herself then she proceeds to take her to he  fathers an  leave  her there again ALONE. I don't understand how this book could get more than two stars I am absolutely in aw of the selfishness the main character display s
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I've enjoyed PlayFirst games in the past, but this game just got deleted before I've even had a chance to open it to play.<br /><br />The first couple of times I'd find the game open, I thought perhaps I had inadvertently touched something to open it. But the last three times I was in the middle of doing something else, when the screen went black, and up popped an ad to buy the very game I had installed, and closing the ad left me in a game I never wanted to open. Whatever app had been interrupted by this maneuver had been shut down.<br /><br />I looked around in settings, and turned off notifications, hoping this would stop. Tonight it happened again, and for the last time, as I deleted the game in disgust.<br /><br />PlayFirst has just permanently lost this customer -- the only good thing is that thankfully I got the game as a FAotD, so at least I hadn't paid anything to have my Kindle hijacked on a regular basis. Whoever dreamed up this sales tactic needs to find a new job, preferably not in marketing.
B00A27X972|5.0|I thoroughly loved this book. I enjoyed one of Haig's previous books (The Radleys) and so I had high expectations and he did not let me down. This was as clever and intelligent. It was also inspiring and heart warming. I wore out my Kindle highlighter reading this book...so many great lines and insights.
B002HK9I04|5.0|South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is one of my favorite comedy movies and I LOVE South Park and Family Guy. This movie is so hilarious and I laughed so hard at the Terrence and Phillip scenes. This movie starts third graders Cartman (my favorite character), Stan, Kyle, and Kenny went to see their favorite Canadian actors: Terrence and Phillip in their new movie A@#es of Fire. After the movie, the boys started to mimic the bad language of the movie at their school and it angers their mothers. The final straw for the angry mothers of South Park is when Cartman made a $100 bet to Kenny to make a fart fire, but Kenny lit himself on fire by his own fart, is killed, and sent to heck. The mothers of South Park ask the government to declare war on Canada, put a V-Chip on their children, and execute the war prisoners Terrence and Phillip. Satan made a sign that he will rise above Earth when Terrence and Phillip are killed and rules Earth. Will the boys save their home and Earth before Terrence and Phillip were killed and explain the freedom of censorship and the freedom of language to their parents. If you are a die hard South Park fan, BUY THIS MOVIE AND THE SEASONS.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Long and involved clearly a read for the summer. A plethora of characters, motives, and plot tangents make for an engrossing and entertaining read. Waiting for volumes 6 & 7.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I would. give this 5 stars but realms is not working I thought. everying will be. working but besides. that every thing is good but I wonder why TNT is not blowing up in creative. mode but yea FIX REALMS
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very different from any other game I have played but still interesting and fun glad I got it you should play it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|love the game!!!  its very addictive! !!  great to keep my kids busy when I need a few minutes to get things done.  only problem I'm unable to use face book
0679805273|5.0|Ordered three books.  One for my son.  I ended up giving the other two to a close friend for her two daughters.  I shared the idea of having each teacher write a message for my child at the end of each school year.  She loved it and decided to do the same with hers.  I'll be ordering two more.  One for my yet to be born daughter and another for my friend who recently birthed another baby girl.  Looking forward to sharing each book with each of my children in some not so distant future and reliving all the memories of their childhood.  So special.
0525478817|5.0|was very pleased to find this wonderful book on amazon for a great low cost! its not everyday that you are able to save money.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK SERIES SO FAR IT IS EPIC YET IRRITATING AT THE SAME TIME I MUST FINISH
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use pinterest when I'm researching ideas and design work for my books. I search the internet for the imagery and pin it to my boards. It is a very personal use....and it is cool when other people like a board and follow it. I don't pin for others, really, I pin for myself.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is super great and entertaining. The only issue I keep running into is sometimes when I open the app, the keyboard comes up and I can't make it go away. I end up having to restart my kindle.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Love this series and this was a great buy!  Recommend to anyone that wants this series, Blue-Ray is amazing!  Bazinga!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is totally awesome I love playing it it just get my mind working and going hard it's so cool
B009DKFSUA|4.0|I love Pitbull, but don't necessarily like the explicit version -- and would have ordered the<br />tame version (if there was one).  My bad...but love the sound and the album despite having to deal with the language.
1878424114|5.0|I am not very religious. This book has helped me find a sort a meaning. I have suffered anxiety and depression throughout my life. I think this book has really helped me put things into a more positive perspective. It helps you focus essentially on loving yourself and becoming a better you.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It's OK.  The puzzles are limited and needs to be played on a Kindle not an i phone.  I might try another puzzle game.

B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is awesome<br />Very good for a free game. Mashed the time go by so fast. You won't be disappointed
B00CATSONE|3.0|This book is a very easy read. I suggest you pick it up if you are looking for a light read and curious to know the politics and backstabbing that tesla had to go through in the 19th century . Don't expect to know every detail of tesla's life in this book as this is not a biography !
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really like the game. I like the puzzles and the length of it. I kept thinking that the game was going to end soon but then there were extra tasks to it that gave it more depth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Everyone at my house loves this game.  It's a bit hard for the kids but they have no problem trying again.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is awesome.  Thrift Shop is my least favorite song on the album.  The beats are great on every song.
B0086700CM|5.0|I find this game VERY highly addicting. I find myself saying &#34;Come on, you can do better than that&#34; and restarting. Ha ha. I try and beat my own score..
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this for everything. Reminders, , journaling, work, this app does it all! So glad I got it :-)
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It was ok for the first few rounds which presented a challenge, but id like to be able to win a couple rounds...?
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I knew this would be the outcome, but I had to...I just had to! G.I. Joe was one of the first cartoons I watched in English back in the late 80s. Its funny, I think the cartoon had more depth, character, and better acting. This felt very much like the cartoon. The bad guys had really cool stuff, but they pretty much sucked everything. The story didn't flow, the acting was horrible (I think they paid old Brucie to be there), the &#34;badass action&#34; just got ever so uninteresting...<br /><br />If there was any redeeming quality, is the delightfully attractive Adrianne Palicki who's red dress appearance will stop many hearts for some time to come. But really...this movie is a terrible mistake. If you want to get your &#34;goo Joe!&#34; kicks, find a pair of destitute children, buy them two GI Joe-toys, and film them play. It will likely be more interesting, your film might actually have some emotional or intellectual depth, and you can enjoy some good karma fall-out.<br /><br />Garbage!
B005HSL626|4.0|Very addicting/ catchy. If I ever feel bored, its always back to this game, and it lures you in to buy their bombs and deflects. I also am addicted to FlowFree
B00DW39B2K|1.0|This movie is some weird attempt to wha tmake the bosnia war americas fault?  Hollywood has gone off the deep end now.  Europe was too lazy to help and the USA jumped in to stop genocide.<br /><br />Now about the movie itself:<br /><br />Wow 0 effort made on any front:<br />1 plot = stinker<br />2 story = stinker<br />3 does wily old cogger use brains to outsmart stronger younger enemy? naaaaa<br />4 are there at least funny line? naaa<br />5 does it make fun of itself its so bad? naaa<br /><br />Does end with a bang? naa
B004SBX112|3.0|Angry Birds Seasons<br />Fun to play does work on problem solving but a waste of your time. Kids like it to play
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I just loved this movie. Looked great and was interested from start to finish. I loved the 'unique' twists and turns. A very fun ride with a lot of depth.
1451648537|5.0|There is much to admire in Jobs' approach to business:  devotion to quality; seeking long-term profitability and market dominance as opposed to the short term obsession with the next quarter that has destroyed so many businesses; the courage to try to define a new market as opposed to being a slave to focus groups and market research; brilliant product-launch marketing; and dedicated hard work.  Isaacson does an excellent job of showing these redeeming qualities of Jobs, and hopefully Jobs' example will be instructive to others.<br /><br />But it is Jobs' darker qualities that dominate the book.  He's a narcissist and control freak who abuses people.  He's cheap.  He denies reality and takes credit for other people's ideas.  Most of all, his zen-guru notions that he was putting a dent in the universe, and preventing oppression by enemies like IBM and Microsoft, and changing the world all ring a bit hollow.  He seems to be in it for the power and the control, and all his talk about higher purpose is so much rationalization.  As Adams wrote to Jefferson:  \\"power always thinks it has a great soul.\\"<br /><br />To Jobs' credit, and illustrative of the complexities of his personality, he put aside his control-freak tendencies and gave Isaacson a free hand in writing the biography.  In the end this did serve his higher purpose of cementing his standing as cultural icon, given the tremendous success of this book.  Jobs was certainly complex and despite being a complete jerk, was weirdly likeable and effective as a leader.  He had the best and the worst ideas as well as the best and the worst qualities -- our job is to be able to tell the difference.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I didn't know anything about this album before purchase (other than being familiar with White Stripes and other artists/projects JW has produced) and after just a few listens, there's not a bad song in the bunch.  There are a a variety of styles along with everything you would come to exptect from JW...even a few surprises.  Again, GREAT album that gets my highest recommendation.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Both my 6 year old daughter & I love this game.  We &#34;take care&#34; of the zoo together.  It's a lot of fun!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Jason Newsted, founding member of Flotsam and Jetsam, played in Metallica, started another project with Echobrain, became the bassist for the legendary Voivod, and now...Heavy Metal Music. I will keep this review short and sweet. This is an awesome album. The guitar work is nicely done and of course you know Newsted will be killing it on bass. It holds a major resemblance to some late 70s and really early 80s heavy metal. More along the lines of Judas Priest and Motorhead if anything. Jason has always had an impressive resume with metal bands. This album should be no exception.<br /><br />The production is heavily distorted but that helps in this case. The bass is incredibly overpowering, but you can still make out the drums. And the guitar riffs have that classic heavy metal feel. I will say Jason's vocals, not the best, but holds a small resemblance to Lemmy in a way. Overall, Heavy Metal Music is a must have for 2013. This is a great record that can compete with some of the best of Jason's career. Keep it up!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the only game on my Kindle that I play everyday.  It's just like the computer version.  Simple but entertaining.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is a awesome CD and the shipping speed was excellent! I love all of Linkin Park music! My favorite song on this album is Leave out all the rest.
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|Bought this at Amazon with free super saver and it was here in no time. Many friends told me it was a must watch video and it was as good as recommended!!! If you love a good movie of good -vs- evel and you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend it! Great flick!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its the closest thing i get to an actual horse.it makes me all happy inside. love it so much. hi.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book kept wanting to read more and it had slot of good twists I would refer it to other people
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I was a nice case, but with a nine-year old (who isn't as gentle on electronics as I would like him to be), the little bands in the corners finally gave out and one broke after four months.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I LUV THIS GAME I have it on my kindle fire and iPod but my sis wouldn't know what this game was like cuz she can't get the app!!!! She Has IPad 1 and it says she needs some gyroscope thingy old WHAT that is or how to get it but please make this game available for her iPad first gen she wants to play it sooooo super bad!!!!!!

B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|There wasn't enough action to this an action flick.  It had long interludes of boring that didn't reach into the soul or move you.  This was boring.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|awsome realy awsome this has to be one of the best series i've read in a long long while Love it!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is always a great way to get the time by and for being bord and when its a rainy day.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I got this app thinking it would be fun,but have not used it very much. I only found one friend I knew that tweets. I probably will not use it much.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this poignant story and learned the language of flowers as well. I would definitely recommend it for groups also.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is just like temple run but better!!! It's so fun and u will never get bored with it. I recommend this app.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|such a well written book I wanted to keep reading and then I didn't want it to end will be reading more of this author
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is a wonderful movie about mother/daughter relationships.  Merida is a great role model for young girls, as she defines her own life.  It's great to see a story for kids where the protagonist is a girl who is not waiting for a prince to rescue her.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game helps the time pass by when your bored. My baby niece likes playing. A good game overall =) You should really try it.
B000I55YV2|5.0|This movie is always a fun romp.  As caper movies go, it is one of the better modern ones.  The characters are well developed for an action movie.  It's a great popcorn and beer flick for a Friday night.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Used to like them it got boring I only recommend this game to people with patience wich I don't have u have to mine alot wich can be pretty time consuming and boring so if u want a time killer and u like the thrill of chopping at at a wall this is for u. If not then i highly recommend kingdoms and lords it is a game where u build up ur kingdom and army and fight against friends and in the story mode against evil. Not that I don't like it it's fun sometimes but I'm an actiony kind of guy and I like action games like cod2.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This submits from my iPod classic very well.  I just need as good a bluetooth receiver now.  Size wise it is tiny, about the size of a long postage stamp, so not losing it is key.  Also, it will drain battery, but I don't use it exclusively, so It is fine for the four hours or so that I need it to work.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this game is awesome! It would be better though if you can change your character I think it would make the game a whole lot better.but besides that it is a game I recommend to everyone.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This movie was a fun reboot of the original series characters.  I love a good sci-fi action and this is one great one.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is boring and for nerds that don't have a life black ops 2 on the other hand is for UN nerdy peeps only and if it a nerd don't play it.  No it's not nerdy it just gets boring after a while
B009HNDCC4|4.0|The last season of MF was okay, but in Season 4 episodes like The Butler's Escape, Arrested, and The Future Dunphys show how the show has taken to laughing at itself.  This season worked well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed this  game. Other puzzles were hard to do and you get stuck quick but this one was doable yet still challenging.
0596805888|5.0|Gift for daughter - She loved it uses this book every time she bakes -  It was a great gift to give her -
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I enjoyed the book,  but having first watched the Netflicks drama I couldn't help but be disappointed . Usually the book.<br />Or reality is better than fiction, but in this case it was lacking the drama and the list of characters the show had. I thought I was going to gain some new insight since the show was only on season 1. That didn't happen for me. The only good thing is in reading this I rather go to the prison in the book than in the show. The characters were easier to live and get along with. You felt you could survive if you got yourself locked up.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Really super read--the way he intertwined the stories & characters was phenomenal!!  Just didn't like the ending.  I had something else in mind other than the way it finished.  Otherwise--You Must Read This!!
1250006341|5.0|These were the perfect item for our production of the musical comedy, &#34;Nunset Boulevard&#34; which I directed at our community theatre.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Just like playing Uno with my students. Ton of fun! I like how you have the chance to challenge a particular group again.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|I have watch this show so many times I cant count.  This is a classic movie and I will be watching it many more times in the future.
140006922X|3.0|I was very much looking forward to reading this book and I became increasingly disappointed as I did so. I enjoy being a Christian, and I am one who rationally contemplates and evaluates discrepancies and differing opinions  - that is why I wanted the book! However I found the approach to this book to be unsophisticated and more aligned with the literate disabilities of Dan Brown.<br /><br />Why a three rating? From my horizon the book would be a one. From a person who wanted to dispel the notion of Christ being a messenger from God, you would give it a five. Thus I went in the middle with a three.<br /><br />The author oscillated from providing an interesting account of everyday life at the times (which I enjoyed) to criticizing the life story of Jesus Christ. I found this up and down presentation to be irritating. A few of the particular drawbacks to this book were:<br />(a) The author pointed out the inaccuraccies and failings of the bible. Knowledgeable and evaluative Christians understand this. But, the author then continually uses statements from the bible as literal interpretations to justify the points he makes. What an incongruency.<br />(b) Certain historic details about Jesus, from non-biblical data are not known by the author, or purposely left out. Either situation is not flaterring to the writer's credentials.<br />(c) A lot of personal conjecture is introduced unverified, presented as factual, and then the writer moves on quickly to use this \\"fact\\" to build on a next point.<br />(d) The writer presents a definition for a zealot which clearly illustrates that Jesus was not then a zealot. The title?<br /><br />My antcipation and hopes for this books quickly did a complete turnaround. The writing, from both literature and academic standpoints, discredits the writer.<br /><br />The writer describes his spiritual path as going from a quasi-Muslim, to a Christian evangelist, and then back to a devout Muslim. Sadly, I feel his spiritual journey clearly reveals the intentions of his writing.

B004XN3FHA|4.0|Have been trying out the TK 41 U2 for the first time tonite as a security guard on graveyard. This is an outstanding light but not that impressed after having used a pair of the Feit 500 lumen zooming lights for several weeks. With the Feit on wide beam you get a big perfect circle of light that has no bright center good for just walking along on patrol. Then if you see something of interest, you can focus the beam in a very tight square pattern that is the same shape as the LED mounted in the head. I patrol the perimeter of a very large property that is surrounded by a cyclone fence. Wih the Fenix if I shine the light through the fence from 10-15 feet away from it I can see a hundred yards or so across the property but there is a lot of bounce back light from off the fence that cuts down my night vision. But if I zoom the Feit into a tight beam and do the same it cuts right through the fence with very little bounce back.I really think the Feit will reach farther than the Fenix even though it is 500 lumens compared to 860. But I would really have to compare the two side by side and right now I can't because the weak point of the Feit is that they are fragile and if you drop it from only waist high it will stop working. I am sending both of my broken Feit flashlights back to the company for replacement. This is one light that really needs a lanyard if you are a butterfingers like me. I put the lanyard on the Fenix right away but the loop that goes around the wrist is very large so I made one small improvement by taking one of those round plastic pieces with the little tension button like you see on the draw strings of the hood of a jacket and placed it on the lanyard so I can close the loop up tighter.<br /> Also as some have mentioned the switch for the modes on the Fenix does not work well. It will click but not change mode and I found you need to push it harder to get it to actually change. The 4  brightness modes on the Fenix does make it more versatile over theFeit with only 2.<br />So if you are on a tight budget and don't want to spend over a hundred bucks for a flashlight get two Feit lights for half the price of one Fenix you will not be disappointed.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|what else can I say? It is quite a solid effort front to back. It is a solid buy for anybody.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like this game but don't like having to purchase things through the app store.  Sometime objects are impossible to see without using items from your inventory.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I just discovered this game and I am really enjoying it. However I wish there more opportunities to gain investment points.
0345350499|4.0|the middle of the book, Mainly section 2 named High Queen, where the story is then dedicatedmostly to the telling of Gwenyvere, almost ruined the the story for me. Fortunately, quarter into the 3rd section it starts to come back to it's earlier brilliance and the 4th section is a heart palpitating finale, in which I found myself heartbroken at the fact that I will be forever be putting down this book to rest; I actually wept in the end. Just for that alone, I would recommend this novel to any who love the Arthurian legends being told in the points of views of women that shaped the rise and fall of Arthur's reign.<br /><br />The pure imagination of this novel is something that I have not read in a long, long time. It reminds me of when I read Homer, albeit in a much easier verse.  I have to admit though in the beginning, I really had to get used to the difficult task of accepting the second point of view characterization, which is my least favorite to read. Often, this point of view is fickle and moody. Which comes to my next point, do not expect the typical descriptive writing you would get from other fictions. It is not descriptive, it will not set the scene and describe background, or the myriad reactions of characters in detail at all in which you come to expect in other novels. Instead, the writing sets a mood, transient emotions, often volatile, fickle and moody; hence why you get the feeling of abruptness in events and conversations. It is also why the writing does not give you platitudes and does not neatly solve and give you all the answers. It leaves you frustrated, questioning, confused, and on edge. But that also gives rise to the enhancement of the novel's plot. You just kept wanting to turn the page as if you could not get enough of what was going on.<br /><br />Had the author just gave a fair amount of pages to Gwen's section, I would not have grumbled so much about it. But it literally took more than half of the section of the novel! The editor could have shaved off 200 pages easy and it would not have impacted the story at all.  And unlike all her other characters in the novel, which I loved-  I HATED Gwen. There was absolutely NO redeeming qualities about her, save till the very end. I will never understand why everyone got such dynamic characterizations except for her. You really were inundated by her insipid, self-righteous, whining, pining, hypocritical devotion to lancelet ad-nauseum!<br /><br />But that is not the only reason why I did not give this book a 5 star rating even with the emotional upheaval it invokes and the brilliant imaginative journey  the author takes you: The lack of development between Arthur and Moragaine, half sister to Arthur and heir to the Lady of the Lake to rule over Avalon as priestess, was completely lost to me. Twice these two come together in dramatic and traumatic scenes that should have given further development between them, which would have made this novel far more superior, but instead the author chose to delve in the whining of Gwen and Lance instead in the first round. The second time around, the event between Arthur and Morgaine is even more heart-wrenching and yet it does not go anywhere after that.  However, by that time the story's plot is so thick and rich you can forgive the author for the second time blunder. But no matter, I was just so in love with the book and of Morgaine's character  that I wanted more of her and Arthur and SO MUCH LESS of Gwen and Lance.<br /><br />Buy the book and let the Mists of Avalon  transform your world back into the making of Aurther's legends, into the mysticism of Avalon, into the fall of Atlantis, into the Pagan religions of Mother Earth, the Goddess, into the Dark Ages of Christianity; let the Mists weave these intricate elements into your psyche  and faith that would resonate with any woman of today  to the utter male dominance of our cultures and religions,  in which have turned all that is female as sin, evil, lustful, and forbidden.rbidden.

B001FAZYOQ|5.0|The first time I saw David Bowie I was 17 in 1972.  It was the Spiders from Mars tour.  He had such energy and charisma - not to mention one kick-ass band.  It was a great show and a great night in my life.  The next time I saw David Bowie it was my 18 birthday in 1973.  He did a lot of the same music but it was another great show and another great night in my life.<br /><br />This live album is a really nice stroll down memory lane for me.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|I just started watching this and love it. I laugh all the way though each show. I highly recommend this.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I shouldn't have to sign in to be able to use features such as save to favorites, especially for a free Bible app. Would like to be able to highlight also. I do like the daily verses, better than some other versions (don't like them too much though, if you're in a hurry, because you'll have to sign in if you want to save to your favs. I like that you can switch from one version of the Bible to another without loosing your place. Would like more control over the highlighting option.  The live feature you get - again after you sign up for an account - is a nice feature especially if your church uses it for recording their notes, wish you could view older episodes though.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Really. Funny had me laughing and waiting for the next line. I love how the plot and everything unfolded. Good read

0375869026|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, read it in one day.  Perfect gift for any person, regardless of their age.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|This game is very entertaining! I like it a lot but there are a few things that sort of bug me with it... first of all, it is kind of hard to steer the cart and turn around the corners and such, second, it times you in the game and it doesn't give you that much time at all, only about 25 seconds, and you can't really get anywhere far into the game. Third is that you can't really get that many coins unless you constantly play it! Other than those it is a pretty good! It had bright, great graphics and is fun to play, a definite game to play when you are bored and just want to pass the time with a nice and fun game!
B005PK553C|5.0|Great show.  more graphic than necessary, but a good story.  Jessica Lange is amazingly disturbing!! I loved American Horror Story.  Can't wait for season 2 to be available on Prime.

B00DGN51O8|4.0|Good action movie, a little violent for children under a certain age.. Other than that great family movie. A little originality play on an old great fable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it's really fun and I like it. It's a bit like temple run but much more fun. It's just  so good that  is no other words to describe it.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Hey this movie was pretty good for a rental. Its not a family movie. No shocking twist or mystery, just pretty good drama movie for mature watching. Proud of Amazon for hiring in USA.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The limitation on games/tokens is ridiculous and frustrating.  Luckily, they made the game just as much fun virtually is it is in real life. The thrill of playing with other players of different ranking is nice as well as being able to connect to friends on your social network. Overall a pleasing app.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Well wasn't much else to watch on the tube, rented and I was glad I did. This movie isn't for everyone. I enjoyed it. My mate said it was just ok. I can't believe Ann Hathaway got an Oscar for her 5 minutes in the movie. Amazon Rocks!
B008J2GAKU|4.0|[Adapted from a post on my blog on Tumblr.]<br /><br />The main comics of Marvel and DC are hard to get into--they are notorious for being messes of convoluted decades-long continuities. DC has made efforts to attract to new readers by relaunching and revamping all of its comic series. By most accounts DC is still a mess. However, the Batman series, spearheaded by Scott Snyder, has been described as a bright spot. I downloaded issues for \\"Death of the Family\\" via Comixology earlier, but after receiving a twenty-dollar bill as repayment for collecting a neighbor's mail, I put that towards downloading the two volumes for \\"Court of Owls\\" directly from Amazon. The latter story arc is what I read on the way to San Diego.<br /><br />Batman uncovers a secret society which, contrary to what he thought much earlier, turns out to be far too real. Once it gets going, the story flows with impressive suspense and some intense turns. A highlight is a scene in the Court of Owls' massive maze. When the Court unleashes its forces, the battles and chases practically compel you.<br /><br />Greg Capullo is the main artist. His human figures take a very slight leaning towards the cartoonish but they are believable enough to convey serious emotions. The overall detailing and texturing convey much grit and the scenery bolsters the atmosphere. The secondary artists, who pop up in different spots within this arc, have different styles that are nonetheless just as effective.  Comic Book Girl 19 did me another favor by recommending \\"Court of Owls.\\"
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Too hard for the little ones. Perfect for everyone else though. A good idea for a game, with no problems, and well polished gameplay experience.
0375714839|4.0|[Adapted from a post on my blog on Tumblr]<br /><br />It is the story--an autobiographical one, in fact--of a woman who grew up in Iran when it was taken over by Islamic fundamentalists. It's a coming-of-age story, so we follow her as she endures the revolution, goes off to live in Europe, returns home, and finally goes back out again. The artwork is a tad simplistic for my taste, but there's a case to be made for such generic faces being made for wider identification (and please excuse me if I'm failing to summarize the theory of iconographic faces). If nothing else, story concretely shows how fundamentalism can really do damage to people's dignity. Stories like this actually have helped me learn more about human sentiments, dreams, and ideals. I do recommend it.

0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins is a very clever man, rightly considered one of the greatest intellectuals of our age, and has done a lot of research to produce a carefully constructed and persuasive case to explain the dangers of and the reasons behind belief in a god.  He will certainly create few new non-believers with this work as faith is so pernicious and blinding but he will give existing ones more and better reasons to reassure them and help them better express their atheism.  A thoroughly stimulating and enjoyable read which should be must-reading in the Bible Belt!

140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan writes beautiful prose and he does his homework.  Once I started reading ZEALOT I could hardly put it down.  No one has written a more vivid, historically accurate, and lively description of the political, social, and religious history Palestine in the First Century.<br /><br />My only complaint is the title and the way the book has been (quite successfully) marketed.  The argument that Jesus was a pre-Zealot is largely confined to a single chapter, and it is - in my opinion - the least compelling argument in the entire book.  Though I agree that Jesus should be seen as a political figure, executed for sedition, I simply don't buy Aslan's suggestion that the writers of all four Gospels portrayed Jesus as nonviolent only because - after the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE - they wanted to invent a Jesus who would not be perceived as a threat to the Roman Empire.  If true, this would suggest that the philosophies of Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, etc. were based on a fundamental lie.  To me it is an inescapable fact that Jesus was tough, highly political, but nonviolent.  Aslan makes the best case he can, but I think he is wrong on this one point.  Jesus did, after all, tell Peter to put away his sword when the Romans came to arrest him in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br /><br />I give the book five stars not because of the Zealot argument, but because of its excellent description and analysis of the relationship between Rome and Palestine; of Temple practices; of individual figures, like John the Baptist, Caiaphas, and Paul; of the \\"render unto Caesar\\" pericope.  I was especially intrigued by Aslan's discussion of James, the brother of Jesus, who - more than Paul - deserves the title of \\"the first Christian.\\"<br /><br />Practicing Christians have much to learn from this Sufi Muslim, who greatly admires Jesus, but doesn't accept him as the Christ.

B00C32R64G|5.0|I just like Volbeat and have since 2006.  With that being said, they are going back to their harder sound and slowly getting away from the more poppy sound they had the last two albums.  But, still great rigs, great chorus and as always, rockabilly with hard core jams.  Johnny cash mixed with queen mixed with megadeath- odd combo I know - but these guys make it work.
0345803485|1.0|This book was on the Bestseller list for 3 weeks before I realized it was a romance novel.  WTF E.L. James?  I'm not suggesting that the cover look like some 50 cent bodice ripper, but some hint would have helped since it being a romance was what generated my interest. Normally I read historicals or paranormal, but contemporary is fine if it has lots of steamy sex which this one seemed to have.  I didn't even get that far.  I put this down after about 3 or 4 chapters.  It was horrible. The amount I read would have taken half the time if the author had removed the parts where Ana was blushing.  Actually I think that in the chapters I read if she wasn't blushing she was asleep.<br /><br />  I was completely disgusted with Ana.  Although she's innocent it seems like every guy she knows wants to date her. (reality check?)  She ignores them and contemplates a relationship with a guy she can barely talk to and finds intimidating.  I couldn't reconcile myself with the fact that anyone would be that stupid.<br /><br />  Having read a boatload of romance novels I could tell right off that she'd let Christian walk all over her, and going by some of the reviews I've read it seems like I was right.  This is not in any way to say that I'm against BDSM. Nor does it have any issue with the dom/sub relationship. This is my complaint that the heroine seems to have no backbone whatsoever in general.<br /><br />  I also had issues with the fact that it was all written in her own point of view.  Usually I like to get an insight into what the hero is thinking which will usually hint at things ahead and give an overall perspective.  This one didn't do that and I was stuck with Ana's repetitive introspection which made me hate her faster than I would have if I were getting both sides.<br /><br />I don't recommend it for anyone.

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I would rate this game a 5 but had to give it a 2....I only got a few games and my tokens ran out. I waited until today but only got 2...enough to play one game.  Seriously? This is just going to get deleted. After a couple of days being able to only play one or two games it will be frustrating.  I feel like I'm being treated like a child and being given a limit on the number of times I can play. This makes a great game very un-fun.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A much slower paced read than Flynn's first novel, Sharp Objects but...WOW!!! Definitely worth the wait. You will never believe the outcome and you will definitely be on edge while reading, especially close to the end!!! A definite MUST READ!!
B006H5120E|5.0|If you haven't seen Titanic in 3D then you really haven't seen it. I have no idea how they take a movie that was filmed in 2D and convert it to 3D but, somehow, it's done and to great effect. Sure the historical aspects of this story are somewhat twisted to fit the romance but this is really a love store within a shipwreck so just accept some of the inaccuracies and enjoy the show. My five stars are for the 3D. Buy this one. You won't regret it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|It is just challenging enough to keep it interesting. However, it needs more levels! I am getting addicted to this style of game.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|We got this on our kindle fire just for fun but have used it a lot. I really like that you can pick the color you want. I use it when I want to read a paper book in bed and I don't want to wake the husband up. Never had any problems with it.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|I thought the film was very good.  The Blu-Ray does not disappoint. Picture quality is Excellent.  It really showcases the different locations in the story. Sound was quite good also. The digital copy iTunes compatible. There is a good commentary track with the director too.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Graphics are great, puzzles are fun, but not too complex. Too much talking, however. Controls are not great, sometimes too difficult to place objects even though they are in right place!
B008JEJPSC|4.0|First the good stuff.  It's really in widescreen like its theatrical release!  The picture looks good for a catalogue title.  Special features are lacking but it's an inexpensive disc. The digital copy is for ultraviolet and it's Standard definition which is too bad.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Game is fun. Some rooms are harder than others. Not enough credits, unless you buy them. Sometimes you'd think the makers of BB are watching and not allowing you to win items. It also seems you can't have too many credits or you'll surely not win any items!
B00C6B8TB8|5.0|Fun film of course, but I'd like to talk about the discs themselves. I got the steel book which I never purchased before. I like the comic book styled art on the cover. The sound and picture are very good. On par with the other Marvel Studio Blu-Rays. There are several documentaries that while not the greatest do cover much of the filmmaking process. Special features also include many deleted scenes and a commentary. There is an iTunes compatible digital copy AND an ultraviolet digital copy, which is nice.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very easy read. Helps you understand why you do the things you do. From bad habits to everyday habits. Great for someone struggling with a bad habit.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|The picture and sound quality are quite high.  Very good detail and contrast. The digital copy is iTunes compatible, which is nice if you hate ultraviolet. I listened to the commentary track. It is informative but not mind blowing.

B0063D7NNA|1.0|Don't let the fact that Oxford published this beguile you: this version of the Collins classic does not merit a purchase.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is an exiting, dark themed and realistic fantasy. It's a story about a young woman that sets out to look for her father in the Old Kingdom, where the dead don't stay still and many dangers lurk about. She is from a long line of magic users that are able to put the dead to rest, and with the little knowledge she has, she starts a dangerous journey into the north.<br /><br />I read Sabriel for the first time when I was 14 years old. A friend of mine lent me the book and it was a start of a long term relationship with Garth Nix's books. I read a lot of fantasy books but Sabriel is a book I re-read all the time. There is some element in it that draws me to it and I can easily say that it's one of my favourite books ever.<br /><br />One of the things I love about it is Sabriel herself. This is a story with a strong, real female lead that is not silly in any way. She feels like a real person and leads you through an amazing journey where she battles with the dead, uses magic never heard of before and meets interesting characters. The world is very believable, and into the later books in the trilogy one get's a bigger view of this amazing place.  This book is so very visual that it plays like a movie right before your eyes. As a illustration student I would love to illustrate Sabriel one day, and I do hope it will become a movie one day.<br /><br />Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?

B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I think this author had a great story to tell, but I feel she was derailed by her editors.  What a mish-mash of story, facts, lists, etc. Despite other comments, I felt like at times I was reading someone's research paper.<br />It is worth the read, but I just wish it had been presented in another format.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is an interesting take on the typical zombie book with a world that has lived through an apocalypse and begun the clean up. The stories of the individuals give a glimpse into not only the event, the terror following the event, but life after the event. It is a good book and an even better take on an apocalyptic novel.
193700788X|1.0|I've never given a book 1 star...but I'll be the 1,077th person to do so.  SO DISSAPPOINTING !!!! Charlene Harris took the easy way out.  All throughout this book, I was hoping something different would happen....something big or atleast consistent with the character (prime example is Eric).  What a BIG FAT DISSAPPOINTMENT.  The publisher should refund our money.....this is awful !!!!!
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|It seems as though everyone I've spoken to believes this \\"Ultimate\\" set does not warrant a purchase. I happen to LOVE the entire trilogy. I already own all 3 standard releases, as well as all 3 steelbooks and Batman Begins and Dark knight Premium DigiBooks. As well as the Target DigiBook for Dark Knight Rises. (I'm as big of a fan as the next guy) I understand people have their opinions and that's ok. But at the end of the day, It's only an opinion.(Don't push it as FACT) If you do not feel this set justifies spending money,Don't buy it. Doesn't mean someone else shouldn't. In my case, I will be purchasing this set and adding it to my already growing memorabilia of The Dark Knight Trilogy. And chances are, If they decide to re release yet again with better PQ for both batman begins and Dark Knight (which they should) I will be buying again. YOu have to understand one thing. This franchise became something bigger than expected. And Warner is VERY aware of that. So if that means putting minimal extras out now and holding off for maybe a 10 years anniversary release later down the road? They MOST CERTAINLY will. It's a business. They want $$$ And I get that. So if you don't want to spend $80 or whatever price it goes down to, DON'T! but Don't knock someone else off for doing so.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|now I have to wait like everyone else. IT's the second book in a series so everything is not nice a tidy but it never gets bogged down and I simply could not put it down. The author covers so much and so little. These books are like treasures and I can't wait for the next one!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing and addicting the only problem is it updates to often so you never get a chance to collect the special items but other then that its brillaint!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I am totally addicted but wish I were not. I am an adult and usually don't see the point in finding random items in a picture. If you are going to waste time finding hidden objects, this is the way to do it. This is very professionally done. Athough I hate the cloying voice of the main character, you can read her lines and skip through it faster. I think about this game when I am away from it as if it were a good book, which it is definitely not. Fortunately, at the rate I am playing it won't last long and I will be able to delete it, freeing myself of this embarrassing addiction.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun very fun but beware! It is extremely addicting! So much fun. Sometimes it is difficult but thats what makez it fun.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING.  SOME ARE VERY EASY, SOME MAKE YOU THINK AND SOME ARE DIFFICULT.  I would recommend this to my friends and family members.
B00EE3KMOI|5.0|An ensemble cast of what seems to be effortless believe ability, this program, from the British beach side to the small town dynamics and the deathly \\"anomaly\\", left me a bit frightened for everyone.  By episode's end, each character, except for the chief investigator and his able assistant, seems to be a suspect and the guarantee that the perpetrator cannot hide and will be found, made the meaning of the small bits of evidence showing the victim's whereabouts the previous evening an unbearable wait.  I am hooked.  Very well played and highly recommended.  I can't wait for the next episode.

B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Wow! I want an Ultimate Guide to all my favorite movies. This is an incredible amount of information. He knows everything about this movie and the original 1932 film. In fact, he's a real Hollywood historian! Even if this isn't your favorite movie, it's a truly fun read. And if Scarface is in your top ten, order this now - you'll love it!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I bought this for a closet with no exposure to outside light. Even room lighting provided minimal visibility.<br /><br />Installation was easy, add 4 AA batteries (not included), put two mounting screws in the closet ceiling, set the light to \\"auto\\" and slip it in place. Opening the closet door is all the motion that is needed to activate the light. It's not real bright, but serves its intended purpose.<br /><br />This light turns off after 10 seconds of \\"no motion detected\\" instead of 30 as described.<br /><br />Don't trust the Velcro if mounting this on a plastered wall or ceiling, use the included screws!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Although really long, it was not too gory for my 10 year old daughter to see, so she could more fully understand the Battle of Gettysburg prior to our visit there.  My mother especially loved it and thank heavens I got an extra copy for her -- she will watch it again.  It was somewhat difficult to learn which commander of which side of the battle you were looking at...

B00ALGW286|5.0|The end of the Soviet era is an irresistible setting for a novel. And native Russian Julia Gousseva has all the skills necessary to deliver a fascinating read. Marina, the main character, is delightful and we're immediately pulled into her world and hoping her dreams come true. But change is unpredictable . . . This is an exciting coming of age drama with important historical events woven through - danger, intrigue, real people - and more change. Highly recommended.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An moving tale with a moving ending. Jordan would be pleased. It's an absolute necessity for those following the tale of Al'Thor.

B00BC24NT4|1.0|I muscled through it, or should say wondered, as it really had no direction.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great revealing story. It stirred my curiosity why he was hidden from Edison. the public. He was not as commonly exposed as thomas edison.  I have to find out more stories about him.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This is an okay game it's fun if you're bored but otherwise it'll just man  you bored it's pretty easy
030758836X|2.0|I would have enjoyed this book better if I was a twelve year old. A twelve year old with an IQ of 55. In order to appreciate this book you have to be a fan of all the CSI shows. You should view Nancy Grace as a legal scholar and you will most likely enjoy this book if you still have doubts about the Earth being round and thunder is made when giants are bowling.<br /><br />We are asked to believe that a woman as intelligent and clever as Amy Dunn would come up with the most unrealistic and complex plan to frame her husband for her own murder. I'm not sure if the author was attempting to editorialize the nature of modern relationships and human interactions. If she did,  it looks like she's calling us all stupid for believing an absurd tale of this nature is plausible. I'd of had a more entertaining time staring at the book while it collected dust.<br /><br />Plot: unreal. Characters: shallow, no explanation or reason for their cartoonish nature. Relevance: none, unless you believe reality shows are blueprints for personal success..
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Lots of fun.Keeps me busy & happy for a long time.  I like all the different set ups I can play. I play it almost every day.

B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher is an addiction.  Lee Child is a genius. My only regret about getting hooked on this writer is he cannot write fast enough. Characters that are full of life; stories that keep you interested and guessing; details that illuminate each book. Get ready to read!

B0063IH60K|5.0|My favorite go to game! Love playing different versions of the game but this one is the best by far.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|An amusing game. the hidden objects are sometimes a little hard to find because they are so small but overall this is worth downloading.
B001AXKXBW|1.0|Contrived, boring, long winded, random, cheesy, and irritating rip-off of the original prog rock masterpiece by Rush.  Rolling Stone is a bunch of idiots without a clue.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Was glad to find it on Amazon.  If you're a big Pink Floyd fan, this is a MUST SEE!  It really explains a lot about the album.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|A &#34;must see &#34; film for all Audrey Hepburn fans.  Her role in the movie as Sister Luke is highly proclaimed.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Toy Story 3, while originally for my children, is a movie that adults can enjoy as well. TS3 is more dramatic and a little darker than the previous two installments. I'm very surprised it got away with a G rating. The &#34;Incinerator Scene&#34; alone should have brought it up to a PG, easily.<br /><br />Nevertheless, TS3 is an amazing family film and a great movie in general. I highly recommend this!
0435121626|5.0|Was like new with helpful notes. :) It was on time and I will definitely look forward to ordering from this company in the future. :)
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Well written. Couldn't put my Kindle down. Lauren Oliver is very skilled.<br />I plan to continue following her. I read entire trilogy and only hope for more to come.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Product works perfectly, doesn't have any &#34;picture tiling&#34; or for that matter any other connection issues, and it even matches the build quality and design of my Mac Air. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|I hadn't noticed this before, but when I saw a clip of this scene on youtube, it brought back the moment.  In the scene where Logan or the Wolverine as he is usually called, was in the apartment with Yukio questioning a high level official, you don't even notice that he doesn't even extend his claws out to put fear in the guy.  The scene was so suspenseful and dramatic that for myself, I had not even noticed that the Wolverine didn't even need to take his claws out.  This says a lot, I believe, on how well done the movie was and all the different scenes.  It didn't need to use the usual special effects or digital effects to keep your interest, even though this was clearly an x men comic book movie, which you would think would require it in each scene.  Another feature of this movie is the character of Yukio played by Rila Fukushima.  I believe in my own view, that she carries the movie practically by herself from the moment she appears.  Even the Wolverine is mesmerized by her martial arts capabilities and appearance the moment he first takes a look at her.  In all the x men movies, you see strong mutant women, but feminine and good looking at the same time.  What is also remarkable about Yukio is that she does not depend on her precognitive mutant abilities in everything she does, but instead has learned the martial arts growing up.  In one scene, she takes a piece of wood out of the ground and uses it as a weapon.  She improvises or takes what is around her to use as a weapon, when she doesn't have a sword available or loses a sword.  She also seems lighter than air as she attacks and jumps off the ground.  This speaks strongly to her martial arts techniques she learned while growing up.  It shows that she is not limited to just using the sword as a weapon of defense or offense.  She has a great personality also.  She is witty, funny, intelligent, and interesting.  She has a great modern female, anime, and almost cosplay (costume play at comic book conventions forthose who don't know what I'm saying) look about her, without overdoing it.  I would definitely get the dvd just to see if there are any extras with her in it.  This was a special four part comic book story of the wolverine.  One of the most famous that involves the Wolverine.  I would get the dvd just for that and the character of Yukio as well.  All the characters were great, but in my opinion, I think she really stood out.  She is worthy to be the bodyguard and guide for the Wolverine in my own opinion.

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|**I was given this book in exchange for an honest review**<br /><br />\\"The Luck of the Weissensteiners\\" is an impressive epic novel, with a cast of really great characters. What starts as a romance soon turns into a war story of surviving and hiding, particularly for the Jewish Weissensteiners.<br />The author included fascinating historical data, that every so often broke up the narrative, and helped me to understand the ever changing circumstances. I knew nothing about Slovakia and what happened there during/after the war, I'm impressed with the number of different stories and tragedies there are to tell.<br />The story is full of suspense; we know what happened in history, but not what happened to the Weissensteiners and their friends. The characters are easy to like, even the bad ones often have redeeming sides to them. There aren't many Nazis in the book.<br />This is a family story, that brings the message home on a personal level what war does to people, even if it doesn't kill them.<br />A great story for history buffs.
B0015AARJI|4.0|took me an extra 2 days than the original delivery date to get it but its no big deal seeing as this thing came from china!<br />controller is in good condition the only thing that bugged me is that someone had changed the R1 and L1 buttons at some point.

0345803485|1.0|After reading this piece of crap my inner goddess has concluded the author must be a virgin who is setting herself up for some extreme disappointment.  Normally I'm not one to comment on literature or write negative reviews but I feel compelled to warn others.  This has to be the most ridiculous book I've ever read.  There is nothing remotely realistic about this book and it's so fantastical to the point that only a delusional person (virgin girl) could have written this.  The plot is almost nonexistent, the poor girl is portrayed as a complete idiot and the dialog is beyond cheesy.  The most irritating part of this whole book, outside of the whole inner goddess, is the obvious use of a thesaurus.  The dialog and descriptions are so repetitive I'm sure the author had to have a thesaurus on hand so that she wouldn't repeat herself.  If you've read the first few chapters you've read the entire book.
0143038419|5.0|I'm jealous of Elizabeth Gilbert's wherewithal to traipse around the world to find herself, but I appreciated being invited along for the vicarious trip. Like taking a year's vacation, Gilbert's writing and story is a decadence the reader  can't help but revel in. Her journey through heartbreak, wound-licking, altruism, and finally, love captures us all because she so eloquently reflects the human condition.
1476727910|5.0|I have a fridge magnet which reads \\"I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe\\" and this is exactly how I felt whilst reading this latest offering from the pen of talented author, Matt Haig. There is no doubt that he is the master of the slightly quirky story, and effortlessly creates a whole set of scenarios which in reality shouldn't work, but which invariably do work very well.<br /><br />In The Humans he has created a brave new world which is seen through the eyes of an unnamed alien who has been sent to earth to take over the persona of Cambridge mathematical genius Professor Andrew Martin, who has recently cracked the elusive Riemann Hypothesis, the outcome of which will change the human race forever.<br /><br />As always, the story draws you in from the beginning, and before long you are laughing out loud at some of the one liners, most of which are inspired - there's are so many to choose from, but my favourite has to be:<br /><br />\\"A cow is an Earth-dwelling animal...which humans treat as a one-stop shop for food, liquid refreshment, fertiliser and designer footwear\\"<br /><br />To write any more about the story would be to do the book a great disservice. It's one of those books which deserves to be read in one sitting with no misconceptions. It will make you laugh, it will make you smile, and ultimately it will make you feel good.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I think if you approach this film as an action/heist film within a science-fiction context, then you will not be disappointed. The main conceit of Inception really is not that complex: what if we could implant an idea within someone's mind without them knowing? The vehicle for this implant in Inception is the experience of dreaming.<br /><br />This idea is not as clearly explained initially as it is later in the film as DiCaprio's character is assembling his team and scheme, so if you're confused during the first scenes of the movie, calmly allow yourself to be confused. Treat it even as if you are in a dream yourself, because Christopher Nolan wakes the viewer to show what is going on through creative action sequences.<br /><br />It is the handling of the action which makes Inception unique among other action films. What would normally be battles in the street have a different tinge once they are understood as part of the atmosphere of a dream. This is not just for emotional effects - there is a creative use of how the physical motion in one dream can effect another.<br /><br />The dreams in Inception seem to be more about excavation and discovery, and not as much about the nostalgia, yearning, or fantasy, that might be in a Gilliam film or others. But the contemporary scenes (streets, hotels, forts) and the fast-paced shooting give their own twist on how we expect dreams to be portrayed in films.  Even so, I never found myself doubting the construction of the dream worlds, even if they were to be declared dreams by a simple statement, rather than familiar cues of dreams in films (e.g., surreal music, hazy pictures, odd imagery).<br /><br />DiCaprio and Page are great in their leading roles, but all of the supporting cast actors are strong: Levitt, Watanabe, as well as Cillian Murphy.<br /><br />I have no comments on the special features - the above review is strictly about the film only.

B000FC146C|5.0|Beginning with Meggie as a small child and building up to her seeing  Father Ralph as a person, male person and then the story explodes with sensory emotions  through a backdrop of Rome and Australia.The story grabbed me from the first page and would not let go. So many components in this book from becoming a Priest to a Cardinal and beyond, to harsh Australian life of sheep farmer, and the most of all, the love story.Buy it, read it, re-read it as I did!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|EVERY TV SEASON has its new sleeper hit. For 2013, it's a smart and sexy sci-fi suspense thriller starring Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany, who recently won the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama for her multi-role part in BBC Americas' \\"Orphan Black.\\" Contenders included Claire Danes for \\"Homeland,\\" Julianna Marguiles for \\"The Good Wife,\\" and Elizabeth Moss for \\"Mad Men.\\"<br /><br />It's unbelievable Maslany was snubbed by the Emmy Awards. What were they thinking? Still, we get these surprises - or shocks - every year, too. (\\"The Walking Dead\\" got nothing again, even after a dynamite 3rd season.)<br /><br />\\"The initial inspiration for `Orphan Black' was John saying `Wouldn't it be cool if you saw yourself on a train platform and then killed yourself?'\\" co-creator/writer Graeme Manson says at the start of making-of feature, \\"Send in the Clones.\\"<br /><br />\\"I think that Graeme and I got very excited about this because we loved the idea of seeing yourself in multiplicity,\\" co-creator/director John Fawcett continues.<br /><br />The main character, Sarah Manning, is a product of the foster care system; she's street smart, living on the edge of chaos. Having just run away from her abusive, drug dealing boyfriend, Sarah encounters the suicide who looks just like her. Despite the shock, Sarah picks up the woman's purse and takes off. She meets up with her gay foster brother Felix, played by Jordan Gavaris in another tour de force performance, where we learn Sarah hopes to change her life enough to care for her 7-year-old daughter, Kira.<br /><br />But Sarah keeps running into women who look exactly like her: Cosima, the genius science geek from San Francisco; Alison, the straight laced suburbanite; Katja, the German punk rocker, and Helena, the killer psycho, a cutter with angel wings carved into her back. Obviously, this isn't just a lost twin or triplet. What's more, someone is trying to kill these look-alikes.<br /><br />Maslany breathes so much life and personality into each character that they all matter. I cared about what happened, what was going on, and speculated on the Big Plot in each of the 10 episodes. So will you. An intense season finale leaves us with a promise of more thrills to come in Season 2, airing Spring 2014.<br /><br />An extra, \\"Send in the Clones\\" is a good breakdown of the series' inspiration with reactions from Maslany, but it's full of spoilers. Don't watch any of the extras - including \\"Interviewing Tatiana, a set tour and interview from \\"The Nerdist,\\" or the \\"Insider Vignettes\\" featuring short takes on the major characters - until after viewing the series.<br /><br />Then you'll want to find out as much as you can about \\"Orphan Black.\\"<br /><br />-- Kay Reynolds

B00BUADSMQ|3.0|\\"SO YOUR SON is a Psycho\\" makes a better subtitle for this fifth outing in the \\"Die Hard\\" series. We met John McClane's (Bruce Willis) daughter in \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" (2007), an over the top production with as many laughs as action sequences. Can you forget McClane surfing into the city on the wing of a crashing plane? Featuring Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and Justin Long as a young hacker, it is the series' highest grossing film to date.<br /><br />We only see Lucy in the theater edition of \\"A Good Day to Die Hard.\\" No. 5 is all about McClane's reunion with his homicidally intense son, Jack (Jai Courtney, \\"Jack Reacher\\" and \\"Spartacus\\") and, while the movie is full of complicated action and fight scenes, it is a much darker outing. In fact, it's hard to recognize as a \\"Die Hard\\" story. Director John Moore, of \\"Max Payne\\" (2008), and unnecessary remakes such as \\"The Flight of the Phoenix\\" (2004) and \\"The Omen\\" (2006), went on record before filming that he felt viewers were done with the humor.<br /><br />Seriously - who put this guy in charge?<br /><br />McClane has always been the good guy in the bad place, dropping one-liners as fast as he drops villains. Here he must be as wary with his son as he is with the bad guys. Son Jack is a member of the CIA; his mission to save a Russian politician finds him on the path to a Russian prison. Dad drops into Moscow to keep Jack out of jail. They haven't spoken in years, so he only learns of his son's career choice while guns are blazing and buildings are exploding. \\"We only kill the bad guys,\\" McClane says repeatedly. It could be an attempt to keep Jack on the straight and narrow.<br /><br />Whoo - we have stepped into an alt-world Die Hard under this director. Jack is bad, bad news, and we've got to wonder how he got this way. This can't be our hero's son. But there are no explanation except, like Lucy, Jack complains that Dad wasn't around enough.<br /><br />We don't see or hear anything from Willis in the high-def extras, which feature a highly technical, multi-part making-of and a special feature, \\"The Anatomy of a Car Chase.\\" The movie opens with a long and complicated action sequence that, despite all the non-CG thrills, takes up too much time. I wish - along with critics and other \\"Die Hard\\" fans - they'd spent more time on story and character. We can see from the extras that director Moore and assistant director Mark Cotone's interests lie in pyrotechnics and stunts. Moore and Cotone also provide an enthusiastic and sadly enlightening commentary. We don't hear anything from writer Skip Woods.<br /><br />It's not easy to choose between the extended and theater version. There's little more than three minutes difference in length. The extended edition ends with McClane and son walking out of Chernobyl, while the theatrical shows an unbelievable family reunion that doesn't fit the bleak story.<br /><br />-- Kay Reynolds
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My kids love it. My little 2 year old can play it forever if I let her. I have even found myself playing it when I am bored. Hahahaha!!
B0000074QN|5.0|I bought (and still have) the vinyl LP of this album purchased many years ago. This CD has IMHO some of Vangelis' best work. Not necessarily his best &#34;known&#34; work, but some fantastic music created during a much earlier time in his career. If you are a fan of Vangelis and do not have this album, I would encourage you to add it to your collection.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An interesting novel about the law, family, and love. I still wonder about the truth involved in the mysterious murders. Bad luck or genetic murderer?
0307341550|4.0|Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn is a story about a reporter assigned to return to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri in order to cover the murders of two young girls.<br /><br />The main character, reporter Camille Preaker, is not terribly thrilled about this assignment since she has not been back home or spoken to her mother in years.  Returning home also reminds her of her own personal problems and the need to deal with them.<br /><br />I found Camille to be a bit repulsive at times. Never the less, the story turns out to be an intriguing psychological mystery and once started, hard to put down.  It also had a much better ending than the best selling &#34;Gone Girl&#34; written by the same author.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's a good game, makes you use your brain, but I'm a little confused. It seems I have to buy the next chapter to keep going with the story. Hope that's not true. I also like the fact you can use hints of you get stumped.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|REMEMBER HOW EXCITED you were to see \\"Prometheus\\" last year, the would-be prequel to \\"Alien\\"? Remember the disappointment? Now check out Universal's \\"Oblivion\\" for a better story, characters we can like, and terrific visuals.<br /><br />Yes - Tom Cruise adds another admirable science fiction film to a list that includes \\"Minority Report,\\" (2002) and \\"War of the Worlds,\\" (2005). \\"Oblivion,\\" from Universal Studios, plays to a smarter audience, requiring us to pay attention and think. I like that in a movie, no matter what the genre. I also like the co-stars - Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko.<br /><br />Directed by Joseph Kosinski of \\"Tron: Legacy,\\" (2010), \\"Oblivion\\" is based on his story that was originally intended as a graphic novel. A sample chapter was handed out at the 2008 San Diego Comic Com. Cruise got a look and approached him to develop it as a film instead.<br /><br />The story blends character with mystery, outstanding effects, and futuristic toys set in a \\"beautiful desolation,\\" as Kosinski calls his world. In the five-part making-of feature, he explains he was, \\"inspired by shows I liked as a kid like \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" movies like \\"Silent Running,\\" \\"Omega Man\\" ...  [`70s films] with a small cast of characters, but big ideas.\\"<br /><br />The year is 2077; the moon has been destroyed by invading aliens and, while the humans fought back and won, Earth has been destroyed by tidal waves, tsunamis, volcanoes and nuclear blasts. The surviving population now lives on Saturn's moon, Titan. Cruise and Riseborough's characters, Jack and Vika, have stayed behind to repair security drones and safeguard fusion converters emptying the oceans for transport to Titan via a massive mothership. Scavs - surviving aliens - are the problem, trying to sabotage these efforts. The two have been voluntarily mind-wiped to focus on their jobs, but Jack continues to experience flashbacks to a pre-invasion New York City and a woman he can't put a name to.<br/><br />Kosinki's images were used by \\"Oblivion's\\" design department. One of the most important is a glass house, the Sky Tower, set on a very delicate foundation structure 2,000 feet above the Earth's surface. It took five months to figure out how the metal-supported design could be constructed, even though it was never built except as a set onstage.<br /><br />The crew used front-screen project, a technique Stanley Kubrick developed for \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" By using this instead of green screen, cloud formations filmed 10,000 feet above sea level in HD, were front-projected on a circular screen surrounding the Sky Tower set. Glass and reflective surfaces, even the actors' eyes, reflect the skyscapes during scenes, creating an even deeper sense of visual authenticity. It looks perfect on the 1080p transfer. Detail throughout the film is absolutely flawless; it's definitely one of the best pictures to be found on Blu-ray this year.<br /><br />Location filming was done in Iceland, where more of Kosinki's imagings, such as a Bubble Ship and streamlined motorcycle that fits inside, were created. A pilot, Cruise helped design a functioning interior for the gyro-spinning cockpit of the ship. The actor, who turned 50 during filming, received an \\"Oblivion\\" motorcycle to keep.<br /><br />An immersive DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix utilizes surround speakers to their best effect. Dialogue, ambient sound, effects and a great score by M83 blend beautifully. One of the extra features is an isolated track in Dolby True HD 5.1 that allows us to watch the movie with its score alone.<br /><br />Additional extras include four deleted scenes, which further explain a few movie moments, and a technical commentary by Kosinski and Cruise. Most of their information is covered in the splendid making-of series. As usual, don't watch the extras until after viewing the movie unless you like spoilers.<br />-- Kay Reynolds
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found very interesting. Made me wonder if J.P Morgan and Edison where not looking at filling their pockets would the cell phone be over 100 years old?
B000005S2Y|5.0|This was another Vangelis album that I have had in vinyl for many years that I have finally added to my CD collection. This cosists of just 2 tracks. Each was one side of the original vinyl LP. The entire album is obviously themetic and the music changes in tenor throughout both tracks as the listener transitions between Heaven and Hell. Track two ends with a great vocal by Jon Anderson that is often included on other Vangelis' albums, So Long Ago, So Clear. It is the only vocal and the remainder of the album is Vangelis doing was he does so well. A great addition to a Vangelis library.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is so fun! A fun game to play if you are bored. I had no problems with this game at all. I think everyone should get this game young or old.
0762445262|4.0|This toy is hilarious and was the perfect gag gift for my husband.  His only complaint was the light does not illuminate very far or very brightly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|... or any other tablet for that matter!<br />A must have for any tablet user. Great graphics, loads of fun and very addictive.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|ARE YOU A good witch or a bad witch? It's easy to tell in writer/director Tommy Wirkola's fantasy horror flick. These child killing, curse-casting evil-doers look as bad as they are and, boy, are they ugly. Beautifully, don't-turn-out-the-lights, Tim Burton-like ugly.<br /><br />Creative make-up and costumes, steam punk weaponry, medieval fantasy sets and high flying wire work give \\"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" its style. The rest comes from its actors - Jeremy Renner as Hansel, Gemma Arterton as Gretel and Famke Janssen as Grand Bad Witch Muriel - and Norwegian-born Wirkola, also known for \\"Dead Snow\\" (2009), a nasty little gem about med students on a ski vacation who run into WWII Nazi storm trooper zombies. \\"Hansel & Gretel\\" is Wirkola's second film.<br /><br />The movie opens with a rehash of the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm: The children's parents leave them alone in the woods; the starving kids find a house made of candy and are captured by an evil witch who intends to make a meal of them, starting with Hansel. The boy is imprisoned in a cage and forced to eat candy to fatten up, while his sister becomes the witch's slave. But, while preparing the cook fire, Gretel turns the tables on the witch and frees Hansel. Together, the two push her into the oven and save themselves.<br /><br />In three minutes we're watching credits roll, while a series of woodcut illustrations updates the story.<br /><br />In the \\"Reinventing Hansel & Gretel\\" feature available only on Blu-ray, Wirkola talks about fixating on the story as a boy. He wanted to know what happened next and, in the grand tradition of fanboys everywhere, he figured it out himself: Brother and sister go into extreme witch hunting, saving children and villages, seeking out bad magic-workers and taking care of business. There are other unique twists: Hansel is now a diabetic who must take insulin shots, a result of his first, witchy encounter. Wirkola employs a time-accurate syringe here, big enough to look like a weapon.<br /><br />Sets and costumes may look like fairy tale fantasy, but the weapons and language are anything but. Dialogue is modern and f-bombs explode frequently, especially in the extended edition. The extended film is 10-minutes longer and features more gore, a brutal beating and near rape of Gretel, and a vivid moment of vomiting. Stick with the theater edition, which has plenty of fun without the disrupting excess.<br /><br />As for the weapons ... they would make Rambo proud. There are Gatling cross bows, firing dozens of arrows per minute, automatic weapons, long ribbons of shells, and grenades. A good witch's spell helps make them impervious to bad juju.<br /><br />Additional HD extras are \\"The Witching Hours,\\" about turning all those extras into individual baddies, and \\"Meet Edward the Troll.\\" Edward is another original to Wirkola's reboot; betcha like him. Note that the extended and extras are only available on 2D Blu-ray; the 3D has the 3D with the theatrical cut, no extras; the theatrical is only available in standard-def, with no extras. Most standard Blu-rays offer both on one disc. What's with that, Paramount?<br /><br />You gotta know this isn't Shakespeare; it's not even J.K. Rowling. \\"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" is good old fashioned, B-grade movie fun. If you've got a taste for the absurd, it is a perfect popcorn movie to watch at home. (But not for young children!) Renner (\\"Marvel's The Avengers,\\" \\"The Bourne Legacy\\") and Arterton (\\"Quantum of Solace\\") have great brother-sister chemistry, trading quips and rockin' the battles. A flaming finale has them confronting 50-plus witches. \\"I fire my gun and it's like turning a light on in the kitchen. Cockroaches are scrambling everywhere,\\" Remmer says, laughing.<br /><br />It made $54 million domestically when released in January, more than clearing cost, but made a killing, roughly $169 million, internationally - enough for Paramount to start on a sequel. I'll be watching for it, especially if Wirkola and his original cast are onboard.<br /><br />-- Kay Reynolds
B005LAII4E|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater when it came out, and just received this in the mail.  If you saw and enjoyed the first movie, you will like this one.
B004LWZW24|3.0|Not a bad movie. Not sure I would watch any part 2. For the price it was worth the buy
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|When I first got this game it worked fine, then after just two days it stopped working. No matter what I do this game will not open. To bad, is was a decent game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is an amazing app i always use it and it does not drain my battery at all wow best alrm app ever
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great and addictive game. everytime I start playing it I end up playing for hours.<br />its such a cute game.
B000P407K4|5.0|I chose this title because I have seen before and could watch again and again. I think this film should be shown to students.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|I was interested in how they would develop the story of how the Wizard of Oz came to be. Reviews were not kind and the men in my family who watched it with me, were not impressed.  But, I enjoyed it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Easy and had really good graphics. Love the game. I will be looking for more apps like it. My kids enjoy it too.
1401223176|5.0|Story:  Someone is out to get Batman.  And he's pitting some of the biggest members of his rogues gallery together in a chess game of intense wits.  To those who know the villain of this book, you will still enjoy it.  To those who don't know, prepare yourself for one of the coolest Batman mysteries you will read.  Hush is top notch from start to finish, with the mystery foe appearing and slowly working his way into your mind with some memorable quotations.  There's a controversy there at the end, but I didn't mind at all.  It may leave you with a bad taste, however.  Loeb's mystery of Hush is great, and Hush is an awesome addition to the Bat-lore.<br /><br />Grade:  8.8/10<br /><br />Artwork:  Jim Lee does the art.  Do I need to say more?  I do?  Fine.  Lee's work is as great as you would expect.  Some of the guys are little too angry looking at times, and some of the anatomical choices might be questionable, but nothing stands out as bad by any means.  Also, several of the Batcave shots are so many different kinds of awesome.<br /><br />Grade:  9.5/10<br /><br />Overall:  Hush is one of the best Batman story arcs out there.  With gorgeous artwork and abounding mystery, this book resonates with all the things that make Batman, Batman.  A cool mystery, a brilliant villain, numerous foes, many allies, and an intense love interest make for a fantastic read.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  9.2/10
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great but I what I want to known is how play mulitiplayer so if you know please post it on here
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Each character has their own love story, in an unconventional telling of life's adventures.  True friendship like the two boys have is golden.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I gave this game five stars because it is a very fun game. You get to work on your skills in order to win the competitions. So far the only complaint I had was with the time it took to download the game.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I did not see this in the theater, but after seeing it on DVD, wish that I had seen it when it first came out.  Loads of action.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book. I love the characters. I love the thoughts. I love the style. My highest recommendation. Five stars
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like this series more than Fifty Shades, because there is an actual story. I am to the point that I am skimming the sex scenes, since its the same thing over and over. There is more to come and I've not gotten so bored that I will quit the series, or maybe  I will...
1605981834|5.0|A KISS BEFORE DYING is an Edgar Award Winning classic mystery that, arguably, was the beginning of the modern psychological mystery thriller.  This is a classic tale of murder for money, but it's the brazenness of the criminal that becomes the shocker.<br /><br />Young handsome college student meets beautiful young coed. They plan to marry, but for all the wrong reasons.  Our handsome hero is anything but the hero.  We get to experience all of his thinking as he plans out his wonderful life that just need lots of money to be complete.  Coming from a very poor background, what better way to use his brains and good looks, than to find the perfect rich wife.  Only when complications arise, maybe she needs to die.  Maybe this happens one too many times!!<br /><br />The build up of the plot through the killer's mind is done beautifully in this book.  His \\"out there\\" reasoning is followed through from beginning to end  in a book that constantly makes the reader want to warn the characters of impending danger throughout the story.  Suspense is built to a tingling point more than once in this masterful psychological suspense. Many of Ira Levin's books were made into movies, but the book never reads like a movie script. Must read for anyone thinking of writing psychological suspense.
1595827684|5.0|THEN GET THIS BOOK DON'T DELAY! JUST GET IT!<br /><br />But seriously, the book is high quality and highly educational.<br /><br />Perfectly explains the Mass Effect Lore and the conceptualization of the Mass Effect Universe.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this was a very unusual type of writing.  It kept me guessing as to who was guilty and what REALLY happened.  I really enjoyed this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was amazing and I fell in love with the characters like the people from the capitol fell in love with the tributes!
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This book is a good book. It is easy to understand and short. This has to be my favorite book ☺
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy app for Android devices, very simple to use &amp; really works to clean up any space you need...works good on the Kindle too
0064471837|5.0|In 2000, I was looking around the book store not really intent on buying anything. I was just following my parents around. I found a book that caught my eye. It was Sabriel. I bought the book out of curiousity and for the first time in my life I read a book outside of a school assignment. The character development, the plot just enthralled me. Most of the current fantasy books have the generic elves, orcs and all those cookie cutter characters. But not Sabriel. Garth Nix jumped head first in a uniquely original storyline. His take on death has set the precedence for me and every other dark fantasy. I would highly recommend this book. I wasn't disapointed.
0316247545|3.0|I think the most expensive part of the book was the cover. The inside is just copy paste from the show. All of which is low-rezed, and many of which are misplaced, construed, and out-of-context.<br /><br />Discord has his tail missing.<br /><br />It could just be a mis-print. But not likely.<br /><br />The text however is worth a read. It's a highly intricate book for 'young' kids, almost as if intended for 'older' readers.
0064471837|5.0|I first picked up this book when I was 14 and over 10 years later I still consider it to be one of my most favorite fantasy novels. It is such a unique and interesting story. Every time I read it I am enchanted anew by the plot and the characters. I recommend this book to everyone!
B004SIIBGU|1.0|It won't let me sign in. It keeps saying my user ID and password are wrong. Unfortunately this happens to me with ebay all the time.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Loved this book....made me laugh and roll my eyes a lot.  I have to say it was great to get this book from Drew's POV.  I'll be buying more from Emma Chase.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|great movie.to have in your library. makes ya wonder about life beyond our planet. if u liked the first one u will definitely like this one. I would like to see a part 2 to this one to see if they get off the planet
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun..want more rooms added!  Hard enough to keep you wanting more, but not so difficult that you look for cheats.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've played some time management zoo village games and this is the best! I love the animations so much and the gameplay is unique with the mini games.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|Finding yourself is a process but feeling beautiful is something completely different.  Park and Eleanor are examples of having a teenage connection that is pure, confusing and invigorating all at once.  The story is endearing and fruit filled with love.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Rear instruments, real singing, rear message rear music.  This stuff is so good.  You can go to your high school kids game and they are going to eventually play some EWF.  Love it.
B001NI24OI|5.0|Great product, shipped fast, good quality. Great recipe. Very good movie as well. Would recommend to buy it and to see it as well.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|My little girl loved it she said it was soon fun but one thing she didn't like was that u have to buy a lot of stuff.
1439127727|5.0|I loved this book! Members of Congress, who can't seem to work together should pick up a copy. This story of former Presidents, helping (and sometimes hurting) the current President is worth the history lesson.<br /><br />I study the Presidents and found some very interesting information I had not previously known.<br /><br />I thought the story of Bush 41 and Clinton was the most eye opening. I wonder who will give 41's Eulogy now...<br /><br />Most stories will give you hope in our system, some (A few post Presidency stories with Nixon and Carter) might not.<br /><br />I wouldn't miss the last third of the book no matter what. Pick up \\"The Presidents Club\\"!
B00B2166BS|3.0|Doesn't charge much faster than using USB but it does allow an OTG adapter to be used at the same time.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new version is terrible!  Continually crashes and won't let you change screens. Very seldom updates conditions. Bring the old one back!!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have learned a lot about the human body and nutrition.  I recommend reading books like this before joining a gym.  Know what is required and expected before committing to an expensive gym membership.  A must read.  Also recommend other similar books.
B00DDUIW18|3.0|The description does NOT accurately describe the product. It was only after I bought that Kindle Edition that I found the following in the end of the book.<br /><br />\\"This eBook version of the print title does not contain the practice test software that accompanies the print book.\\"<br />Odom, Wendell (2013-05-10).

B004ADH1RI|4.0|Took a trip to Astoria and was in the mood to watch this movie.  Amazon has it cheaper than anyone else.
B002EWANQS|3.0|Good and comfortable to carry everywhere but pricy and for that price It could have had the on/off switch though
1600243916|5.0|Our son loved this book so I bought it with every intension to read it but have not read it yet!! But my 34 yr old son who is extremly successfull loved it!
B000JRYOPG|1.0|Not the right movie
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Just started using it, so far, been a good one. Easy features to use, nothing to fancy.like using it to send finished photos out.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm about 1/3 of the way through the first book, and I'm really enjoying it. Good futuristic science fiction. Plausible with good characters.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Bought for my wife and grand daughter.they watched it and loved it. Will probably watch it a dozen more times.
B00006JI11|1.0|This was one of my favorite movies when I was younger. I purchased it since I hadn't watched it in a very long time and to my disappointment, it wouldn't play. Not in the PS3, not in a normal DVD player. It's not a normal DVD format...from what I've read after researching why it won't play, it's a foreign DVD that's not formatted for American DVD players. Whaaaa? Anyways, it was too late to return it, so I eat the cost, which sucks. Buy at your own risk.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a great app for me and anybody else that is in to world war 2. There aren't many guns but I think they're adding more soon.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is a good disc to listen to in the car since the mellow music will help ease the frustration of traffic going to and from work everyday. It really soothes the nerves and puts one in an &#34;island&#34; state of mind.
B00555X8OA|1.0|The author seems to be so concerned with the opinions of his peers (other researchers) who might read and criticize the book, that he forgets to write in an engaging way for the general public.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved this book! It was amazing I highly recommend it well I guess this means onto the next book
B003DT19F0|5.0|Bought for my wife and grand daughter  who are avid Tinkerbell fans. they watched the movie and loved it. They will watch it over and over again.
B00001NTXN|4.0|This is a really fun strategy game. It is for up to four players, but I think it works best with two. With four people it turns from a strategy game into a negotiation game. This specific version of it is very well made. The only thing I would change is adding slots for the walls on the side that don't have them for playing with four people.
1607066017|5.0|This has to be one of the best series out right now, I highly recommend picking it up. Its worth the buy.
B00D2K40WY|2.0|Ok first off its gonna cost money to pretty much do any thing and it ie ok i guess so if you got money this is the game for you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game EVER! So if you don't have this app ,get it NOW! Because it's so fun and free! ;)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Love the author. Love the book. Love the writing. Love Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. Highly recommend. I will be reading this again most definitely.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Both my husband and I play this game daily. We like it so much that we have it on all of our devices.  The video ads are annoying especially those that you cannot exit.
B001JL2V1K|3.0|So, I found this on Netflix and since I pay for monthly we watched it there, rather than on Amazon Prime (of which we are members also) where it would have cost us.<br />I was a bit chapped to find that a 9 year old DVD would cost us to watch on Prime.<br />Now for the reason for not buying this piece and let me clarify that both my hubs and I are musicians so maybe we were watching with too bit of a discerning eye? yes,<br />But they said 50 years of Strat, I assumed it would the very best of all the world's Strat players. Shame on me.<br />To the content, this dvd does not tell you who some of these jokers are on stage and there is a lot of question as to why they are there in the first place.<br />Now to the reason why you want to see it, Gary Moore- he absolutely was channeling Hendricks,of course he doesn't have to try hard to burn it up!!!~ too bad they only had him do one piece<br />Joe Walsh- as wild & incredible as ever, although I must say the crowd certainly didn't get behind him like they did their 'Brit Boys'<br />and while I may tick off some when I say this - we thought Amy Winehouse was incredible, I hadn't yet seen her sing- close your eyes and see if you don't think she is a BIG Beautiful Black Plus size mama- she was clear headed & singing the hell out of the blues - which is what a Strat does very well ! And then I might add<br />You come to the man that makes you weep,that made all of us wish we knew the way of the delay as he does~ the Only David Gilmour I must say Thank God to the cameraman, for getting such wonderful closeup shots of his hands during his set. There were things I saw that I had missed before. Too bad he didn't think to do this until Mr. Gilmour was playing ;} Too bad it was only 3 songs and too bad they didn't end it there,instead of letting Ron Woods coming on after.<br />I wish I knew who the man was that was playing just prior to David Gilmour's set,he's in a bluish suit and plays a white strat, he plays an incredible piece, but no one tells you his name.<br />And now for my last say, The Backup musicians ought to be given a standing ovation they were incredible through out it all, absolutely seamless. I have never seen a drummer play from sheet music unless they're in the symphony,the bassist is without a hitch, and then the strat player is just a wonder. So know you have our opinion for what it's worth.It's too bad they left out so many truly Great Strat players ( that also happen to English) and of course they had no really New musicians that can tear up a strat like the cat does your curtains!!
0307346617|5.0|i hate that the movie is nothing like this book. i read this book last year, glad i bought it, and was disappointed at the movie. wasnt bad movie, but it had nothing to do with the book. anyway great thriller, amazing short stories, every time i picked the book up, i felt sooo immersed in the details that id think the apocalypse was actually happening. truly award winning
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game like everyday and I love it. This game is so cool. I have this game on my iPhone and I play it a lot.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|This game is awesome fun and addictive but it has some bugs. Sometimes when I open it it'll close after 3 min. I have not seen this game lag so I have no problem there. Another thing is the screen will flip over in the middle of a game. But these bugs happen rarely. Other than that it's a pretty good app. :)
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This app is just a joy to have on my device!  It works quite well and it is just perfect for looking at good music videos.  I like how you can change the quality of the video view.  It's better than on YouTube almost.  It is very fast, and it is such a great app to download.  If you want an app to look at music videos, then you should download and install THIS immediately!  VEVO is EXCELLENT!!!!  :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was so cool and fun the levels were hard though. I think it is better than the other temple run type things.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|SLAMMED & POINT OF RETREAT by COLLEEN HOOVER<br /><br />** 2 books in one review<br /><br />Is it possible to love a book even more after reading it each and every time? I think it is. Colleen Hoover's SLAMMED & POINT OF RETREAT consumes me every time. Yes, I just finished reading SLAMMED & PoR again, I think I've read it 6x in total. I'm doing so because THIS GIRL, a 3rd & (I think) the last installment of the SLAMMED series is due a week or so. And I'm editing my original review. I may be deleting some but will sure add more words to describe how uniquely beautiful is this series.<br /><br />SLAMMED is one of the best books I have ever read. If I could rate it to 10 stars, I will. I sure definitely will. It captured my heart from the very beginning maybe because of how unique & original the story is. The storyline is so real and original that you can't help to fall in love with it. It has a story of love, of family & friends and I appreciate the fact that the story made me laugh and cry til the very end. Indeed, Colleen is one of the best authors in this genre. It was well written and she wrote it with so much perfection and uniqueness. Her humor is amazing and she's simply the best!<br /><br />I thought I will not love the sequel as much as I loved Slammed but I was wrong. Point of Retreat devoured me whole. I can't even begin to tell you how lovely the story is and I can't even think of a better word to describe how I love Colleen Hoover for writing a sequel and how I admire her writing so much. PoR is Will's POV and to read his side of the story is so overwhelming. I guess, if you put the 2 books together it's overwhelming coz the books are sooooo good. Just when I thought Colleen cannot surpass Slammed, she releases a sequel and outdid herself. Unbelievable! She is one of a kind.<br /><br />To say that Lake & Will's life and relationship is unconventional is an understatement.They both went through a tough time and managed to make it bearable not just for theboth of them but for the 2 boys that is their life. Slammed tells their story from the beginning and then PoR continues on how they managed to be together despite the crazy and learned how to hold on and fight for their love. A love that's not only romantic but for the family that they build together. And with Colleen's brilliant mind to incorporate poetry and song lyrics makes it more beautiful. And mind you, I didn't get to appreciate poetry as much before I read her books though I did a couple way back when I was in HS but hers is different. It's emotional, raw and honest.<br /><br />\\"The point is not the point, the point is poetry.\\"<br /><br />I cannot put all the reasons why I love the series so much. There's so many lines and scenes in both books that you will appreciate and can also apply in real life. You will learn, if not a lot in this book about yourself, your relationship (romantic or not, present or in the future), friends and about family.<br /><br />I can't wait for the 3rd one and it's all about Will's POV in SLAMMED. You know what? When I saw the title- SLAMMED, I can't really wrap my mind around it. I can't picture out why the title is Slammed but after reading the book, it's one of my faves already. I really don't read the summary of a book, if the cover & title is interesting enough for me, I choose it and read the whole thing (Ya, I'm weird like that) and with all the books that I have read & if you're following me, you know I've posted my `sort of' reviews here on Tumblr & let me just say that this series is so much more.<br /><br />This is one the best books/series I have ever read and it's so worth reading. If you're a book whore like me and you want something raw & original then buy a copy of this series and read it. NOW! The story will never be a disappointment. I swear.<br /><br />** Also posted on my TUMBLR & gr account
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really think that this book is a amazing like when need to look up a word the dictionary really helps me so that I can have an easier time looking things up
B00846REIS|5.0|I read it twice! The characters were so well developed I couldn't put it down.  I'm very eager to read all the books in the series.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I was unclear why I was not able to open any videos that I found online.  Once I downloaded this app, I was able to view everything.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Need I say more......I,m deeper as nd deeper into this series now I simply love it very much a duck
B00008IHN1|5.0|I purchased this since each time it has come on television I watch it, now i can watch it over and over, Can not get enough of it, always seem to find something I did not see before, Great movie
B0020BUWX2|5.0|IF I STAY & WHERE SHE WENT by GAYLE FORMAN<br /><br />These 2 is now part of my fave books of all time.<br /><br />There are things in life that are bound to happen and sometimes it is painful that you have to choose & hurt the ones you love to be able to live but I guess, it's them or you. And sometimes, you choose you because it's the only way for you to move and live a life- as much as it hurts. I like how the story is so human and after all that's happened, Adam & Mia found each other again and will start anew. IDK but maybe sometimes love is stronger than loss. I'm just not sure. And you will find that kind of story in Gayle Forman's If I Stay & Where She Went books. It is well written & heart clenchingly good.<br /><br />I just love how Adam describes what had happened in such details that you will also feel how hurt & alone he was for 3 yrs. Gayle is so good. I like her writing ability that will hit you in the core.<br /><br />I just love how very everything in books make sense. There are a lot of questions that starts with `WHY?' but in the end it will all make sense cause in the book, it lays all the answer. I guess that's why I love reading novels coz they explain everything, unlike reality where up (I guess) to your death bed you still have questions. That sucks!<br /><br />** Also posted on my TUMBLR & GR account
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Game is hard wish it were a little easier and not the same over and over. But overall enjoyable!!! The minion outfits are the best part
B002PXKWQ2|5.0|Even my  grandson, who is four,  likes this one. It evokes its title without being imitative. Kraftwerk can do no wrong.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I'm like a big minion fan, and this game just... just made my life complete. It's kinda like temple run as how to play, but it's even better cause it's minions.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This new version of UNO is amazing since you can play with real people and has great definition.. I RECOMMENDED TO EVERYBODY!!!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Love the series. Will continue to watch and buy the DVDs. It is one of the few on tV that does not immerse you in gore, blood, guts and violence. Also no gratutity sex. Thanks
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I have been always a baseball fan. I loved the stories and inside look into players I know and the process the A's took. Great baseball stories with just enough how's and whys not to be overbearing.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I picked up the latest Science-Fiction epic Oblivion. Sometimes I get a little worried buying  a movie sight unseen but this time it certainly did not disappoint! The movie stars Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman and was directed by Joseph Kosinski and based on his graphic novel of the same name. The movie is one of the apocalyptic films which displays the planet earth after it has been destroyed by aliens.<br /><br />I have decided this will be a spoiler free review because I think this is a movie you really need to see for yourself and to see it unfold before you. I will give a basic synopsis of the plot. It is the year 2077, 60 years after earth was invaded by aliens. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria \\"Vika\\" Owen, played by the beautiful Andrea Riseborough, are the only ones on  after the invasion and they are there to repair drones that are fighting off the residual alien resistance. The surviving inhabitants of earth are living on Titan one of the moons of Saturn. Harper meets up with Malcolm Beech a resistance fighter played by the legendary Morgan Freeman (one of my very favorite actors) and he also begins to have flash backs to a time he was with a woman on the Empire State Building prior to the alien invasion. Things begin to unravel and we begin to see that appearances can be deceptive.<br /><br />Pros: The cinematography and special effects are stellar. This movie is great eye candy but you do not get an overdose of it. The acting is great and two of my favorites, Cruise and Freeman, are in this film and do a fine job. This is my first time seeing Andrea Riseborough and I enjoyed her performance. She portrays a sense of vulnerability while also wanting to stay in denial concerning the things Jack is discovering. I do like the story. Some of the criticisms I have read that there are plot elements that we have seen in other movies. While I can agree with that assessment, I can also see that this is common in Hollywood movies. I am fine with movies that may have similar plot elements to other movies as long as it is executed well and that is the case with this movie. I also enjoy the story. The movie mixes romance, mystery and action adventure into a tale that will keep the viewer engaged and caring about all the characters throughout. Despite great special effects this is a very character driven movie.<br /><br />Cons: I really have only one minor complaint. Director Kosinski wanted this movie to be an homage to the science fiction films of the 70s and in many way he succeeds in that endeavor. The movie is paced more like a film from the 70s and it is slower than the more kinetic pacing we modern viewers and grown accustomed to. Is that a fault of the directors or is it a fault of the viewer? I will place blame on myself. We live in a fast paced mircowave society that wants instant gratification. So it was hard to slow down and get absorbed into the story. I just wasn't used to it. So really this is not a con, it is just something that the viewer needs to be aware of when going in to the movie. It is an old-fashioned movie and as I think more on the pacing, it really does work even though some viewers might not be used to it.<br /><br />This movie does have some good re watch capabilities for me. As a mystery there are clues throughout the movie and on more than one viewing you can pick up on these clues. In an era where science fiction films are heavy with CGI and are like cotton candy for the mind, this one is not. It will make you think and keep you on your toes.es that may have similar plot elements to other movies as long as it is executed well and that is the case with this movie. I also enjoy the story.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|It appears as though they hired a  bunch of kindergarteners to design it.<br />This new update is pure junk. Bravo.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I can see that Gillian Flynn's books are not for everyone.  They are extremely dark and disturbing.  I really am not sure why I enjoy them so much, other than to say that they keep me turning pages, the story is engrossing even if bizarre, and the books have so many twists and turns that I don't guess where they is going until the very end. Flynn is a very talented writer, and I really enjoyed this book.  I read Gone Girl first, then Sharp Objects, and this last.  Her characters are always tremendously flawed, which I think is part of the appeal.  Very unique.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Works great as advertised. It also allowed me to plug an external USB hard disk drive into the USB and access it via my iPad. This is more than I expected. Very nice product. I liked it so much I purchased another one.
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|As of yesterday I cannot see anything. It all black when I start up app. I purchased this app and I'd like to play it again. Has a lot of issues.
0812550706|5.0|Personal Reflection: Daniel and I were recalling books that we read for school when we were young (both being homeschooled and all) and we realized that a lot of the books came from the Sonlight reading curriculum. When we realized this, we looked up what else is part of that and found Ender's Game. Needless to say, Daniel read it the next day and I've been working myself up to reading it.<br />So worth it! I was really craving a fast paced adventure and this was perfect. There were a couple things that were predictable but I was impressed that I happened to be on my toes much of the time. I'm not normally (ok ever) interested in books about alien invasions and crap like that but this was actually done pretty well.<br /><br />BONUS! There's a movie coming out in November! I didn't actually find this because of the hype for the movie but clearly now I'm excited.<br />Favorite Character I'm on a roll now for the main character being my favorite. Ender (Andrew) was the child prodigy done well. Often I read books about the exceptionally \\"gifted\\" people and I really don't believe it. The way Andrew's mind works though, you can really see the genius  A good secondary character is Alai though. I love that friendship.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The Giver and The Hunger Games had a party!!! If you liked either or both of those, I recommend you at least try this. It's good fast paced exciting lit!
B00785P2QC|5.0|good game just trying to start up is going to take a while other than that its a pretty easy game straight forward
0307341550|4.0|I just got back from vacation, and read Gillian Flynn's earlier two books - This and Dark Places.  I really enjoyed Gone Girl, and don't get to read regularly, and wanted something to entertain me on vacation.  I enjoyed this book, but less than the other two.  The main character was too flawed even for me.  The book is very dark and disturbing, but not always in such an enjoyable way.  This is definitely not a book for most in my opinion.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|I read the book first and I was really disappointed in the movie. There were so many things different . Not at all like the book.
0142410373|5.0|Personal Reflection: I read the more famous Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl as a child and loved it! Roald Dahl's books weren't really smiled upon for reading at my house when I was little so I guess I didn't bother to venture for more of his works. I've read Matilda now as I am much older and honestly I think it's probably better for older people to read. It's child-friendly but I think that children would miss a lot of the references and \\"hints\\" at backrounds in the story.<br /><br />I found myself laughing out loud at the colorful descriptions through this whole book. Matilda's character is really fabulous. Her love of reading is admirable and the list of books she has read is better than most English major college graduates! As outrageous as parts of the story were, I found myself enjoying it heavily. Tim Burton, Lemony Snicket, and Roald Dahl would be amazing best friends I think! They all have such a bizarre sense of humor and outlook on the world that is incredibly entertaining, though mildly disturbing/creepy.<br /><br />Favorite Character: I'm someone who reads a book for the characters. The story can be great but if you don't have good characters I really don't care. I am more drawn to the background characters because they seem to be harder to understand and there is more mystery around them but in the case of this book, the main character takes the cake. Matilda!<br /><br />Bottom Line: Child-friendly, but I think more enjoyable as an adult because of references and back stories only hinted at! I think I will even re read this in the near future. Though I think it's good to keep in mind that I have a weak spot for childrens books.
0770433782|5.0|So excited to plan and this book is just romancing my ideas for my big day!  Great blog turned into a book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a fan of Pinterest, it's like walking through a gallery when you visit. This just makes it easier to visit anytime from the convenience of your mobile devices. The first day after I loaded the app I used it to browse Pinterest from my phone during my elbow to elbow bus ride. Great stuff!
B004ADF7RO|3.0|I only like it because I saw it a million years ago when it came out.  Watch for Samwise Gamgee as a young lad!<br /><br />If I had never seen it when I was young, I would probably hate it.  :)
0553296981|5.0|Personal Reflection: I was told to read this book for school in seventh grade and utterly refused. I tried and thought it was the most awful and boring book to ever be put into print. Looking back, I'm not sure why I thought that. Because I hated it so much I didn't intend on reading it at all but I found an unwanted copy at home and decided to hoard it with my other stuff because it's one of those books that you should own. I'm going through the process of packing a lot of my books up as I move home from college and I'm deciding which ones to bring with me (don't worry I'm not getting rid of any! The boyfriend is nice enough to let me keep some with him so I don't have to haul so many home). As I was looking through I found this on my shelf and instinctively read the first page (as I was doing with so many trying to decide which ones I wanted on hand). I didn't get up until it was finished. No joke. Maybe I was just really in the mood for it but I really loved it for so many reasons.<br /><br />Anne was a great writer. She was quite talented and it's very unfortunate that her life was cut so short. She is so strong willed and though I had issues with some of her character traits, she was so believable and to me that is one of the most important things in a book (as anyone who has read previous post probably knows). I don't mind if people are selfish, annoying, or flat out stupid in my literature so long as I really buy that it's genuine. People are flawed. I loved Anne so much though and found myself rooting for her all the way through.<br /><br />I also love this time period. Anything that has to do with World War I or World War II is an immediate must have for me (especially the latter). I took German in college partly because I love the World War's history, so naturally I guess Anne Frank fell into this category well and wow.<br /><br />There's not a lot to say about Anne Frank. She is a great writer and reading it for her style and ability to express herself is why you should read it. I remembered correctly that not many exciting things happen (when you're comparing it to things like The Hunger Games anyway) so this is really a book to just relate to and understand this girl through this stage in her life. Anne is very mature for her age which is possibly why I did not like the book the first time around. She speaks well and is well thought and intelligent for her age and I guess it's possible that I didn't understand or appreciate much of her story at twelve compared to now.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you didn't like it when you were younger, at least try it again. Like I said, Anne is very mature for her age so it's possible that like me you just didn't care to understand how profound she really was when you tried reading it last. If you like historical accounts also this is a book for you.why you should read it.

B000HL2J0G|5.0|Since I grew up watching MacGyver, I was happy to see that Amazon had it for free on Amazon Prime.  Re-watching these episodes, I am reminded how fortunate Mac was.  While he never used a gun (excluding his own improvised projectile contraptions), he was shot at plenty of times.  Lucky for him all the goons were really bad shots.  These shows are still fun to watch just to see what he makes next and out of what.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Yes, the HBO series is good, but the book is better. So much richer, more depth. Take the time read it, you won't regret it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was amazing!!!!! I loved it. I couldn't stop reading it was so good. It took me one day to read it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My parents say im too old for this but its just super fun and they're super cute and its like the movies wich i love
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great thriller just like an action movie but very well done. After finding out about the Reacher novels after seeing the movie, I decided to read the books. A good start to a character I look forward to getting to know.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best game I had ever played in my life!!! Buy the app people because man its awesome!!!!!
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Very compelling, high replay value and hours of fun.  This game is what most mobile games aspire to be.  Definite buy.  If you're a candy crush or bejeweled casual gamer this may not be the game for you.  There is real strategy involved and at higher levels the A.I. can be crushingly smart.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had a hard time getting into it but then I couldn't put it down.  Thought the ending would've been different than I expected.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Not impressed at all.  Very slow in responding, shuts down in mid-game and is generally a sluggish game. Do not recomment
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Got two of these for both cars. Like the fact that they stick out far enough  to remove after using with out needing tools to remove
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|this is a really good puzzle game that makes me think and use my brain.  as a free download, i highly recommend.  not sure I would spend much more than a couple of bucks on it though.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I bought this for my daughter - my granddaughter (age 5)- my husband - and I enjoy it as well. Bruno Mars is so much fun to listen to. As always the best prices are at Amazon!
B0002KVULG|5.0|I first saw this on HBO back in the 80's and just melted. Unlike its predecessors or the common-told vampire tales, Langella's portrayal here is much more handsome, seductive, and deducing. Langella can make any woman melt under his bewitching charm. Brilliant supportive cast includes Kate Nelligan as a more liberated Lucy, who falls under Dracula's handsome seductive spell, Trevor Eve as press-solicitor Jonathan Harker, and the legend himself in one of his final screen roles, Sir Lawrence Olivier as Dr. VanHelsing, Dracula's nemesis.<br /><br />An absolute must-see.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Although I enjoyed the action in the movie, it was lacking a real plot.  I was also disappointed (*spoiler alert*) that Duke was killed off within the first part of the movie.  I did enjoy the performance of the actors in the movie, but overall felt the story was lacking a good plot.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|We loved watching Phillip Phillips on American Idol and bought this the week it was released. He is so talented. He was true to his artistry. It's refreshing to listen to someone who doesn't want to fit into a specific mold. He will be around for a very long time. People of all ages enjoy his music!
0345803485|5.0|It was quick shipping I ordered the book before a flight to New York, and the book was so good I couldn't put it down. The time on the plane felt like 20 minutes the book was so intriguing it has many things, action,humor, romance suspense. I've already ordered the next two.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game and is challenging enough without being too frustrating. Wish there were more levels to complete, but you can't complain about the price.
B009TO99TG|5.0|The CD set came very fast and at the price its ridiculous to buy a set anywhere els.e<br /><br />All four CD's work and it comes in a nice space efficient box.<br /><br />As for the Music itself, these are the four best Coldplay CD's in my mind. Though their most recent album is superb as well.
B0052FDRI0|5.0|MY KID HAS LOVED THIS ALBUM FOR AGES, AND AM SO GLAD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN IT, WILL LISTEN TO IT OFTEN!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good story line with a nice twist. Baldacci writes another winner.  Love the guy and girl combo to save the day!
B0066W1AZK|3.0|It's a good game. But the graphics could be better. Still it's a fun game, anybody who likes chess and doesn't want to pay for chess this is a great game for them.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Shipping: It can be funny sometimes ordering CDs online, because like when you buy them in a store or through MP3, you want them NOW! But the shipping was so fast, it might as well have been instant.<br /><br />CD: Great CD, which is exactly what you would expect from a band like Coldplay. Though I warn you, they took a more modern take to their older music. This CD features some of the same type of tunes you would expect in the past, but also some with more techno and bass beats. Overall It is my fifth favorite of their discography.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|Well if you are a fan if Oz this should be a part of your collection. There are some variables in this movie that do stick out. For instance the Munchkin Land and how the Wicked Witch came to be. It is a good movie but it must be seen with the original movie from 1939.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|You have got to be kidding me. Well, I thought I couldn't go wrong, after all it IS Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman. Not !!! No way was this a typical Cruise movie and Freeman's role was nothing more than an extended cameo appearance, they must have needed the money. Even though I knew the plot beforehand, it took a while to see where this thing was headed. It was dullsville for the first 30 to 45 minutes into this movie and took a while for the plot to actually present itself. It wasn't until Freeman's appearance that the direction of the movie actually unfolded and started to make a modicum of sense. My wife fell asleep halfway through. And she loves both Cruise and Freeman.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This movie had no chemistry ... none of the humor of the first four movies, and nothing to make it worth the money I spent to watch it  .... :(
B005LAIHPE|4.0|My husband likes old war movies, so I purchased this for him. Neither one of us had ever heard of it. He really liked this movie.
B00005Y228|3.0|This is a good cd for those who like to dance. If you grew up and love feel good music this is it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Yep, I have to admit. when I first saw this movie in 1965, when I was 9 years old, I pretty much said \\"Ugh!\\"<br /><br />When I saw it again, exactly 1 year later in 1966, in the same theater I had seen it the year before, my mind said, \\"WTF\\"?<br /><br />It stayed at the same theater until early 1969, without a break. By then, I hated it, and was glad to see it finally leave Cedar Rapids, and the Iowa Theater.<br /><br />Fast foreword to 2013:<br />This has truly become one of my favorite things. I cannot get through the final scene without being reduced to a mass of quivering, sobbing jelly. It's a great way to clear clogged tear ducts as well.  However, if you don't tear up at the final scene of this movie, you must have a heart of stone.<br /><br />Yes, it's corny, and sugary sweet in spots enough to send you into a Diabetic Coma.<br />But it's oh, so beautiful.<br /><br />Exactly what the doctor ordered for the 2013 Blues.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|the action was ok .... the story was a little overblown ... bruce willis kind of mailed in his performance .... all in all it was just ok
B000002U9L|5.0|This was purchased for our daughter's birthday as this is her favorite movie.  The music is awesome and she loves it.
B002XZ62HK|5.0|I adore this set. It has beautiful pictures to keep out all the time because the calendar can be turned over to view only the pictures. This has wonderful music so soothing and makes anything look bright.
1442337966|5.0|This book is amazing. It will change your life if you apply it. I could say so much but to summarize it, it is simple, easy to understand, motivating and actually works when used and it is not hard to apply the information.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is AWESOME. It is very interesting. I would recommend it for 12 and up because it had some bad language. But still I loved it so much
B0049J3QF4|5.0|This movie is a great, especially a download for a road. My son love it, would not take his eyes off of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There is a game for everyone. The only downside is that you have to play the ones you don't like as well just to get access to other games. All in all I would recommend this app.
0385486804|5.0|The novel evoked emotions of tears and sadness because it made me sad to know that this young man with great opportunities had died at such a young age. Chris portrays a role of a person who isn't afraid of challenges and is waiting to live that wild free life. As I was reading the novel I could relate to him on the fact that he wanted to live an adventurous life with no rules. It brought tears to me because in a way I looked up to him for his courage of actually doing everything he set his mind to. It made me sad knowing that he passed away, but he was a young man who went through obstacles and felt things that probably other individuals haven't because of fear of what society's judgment. At a scale one to ten I would give this a ten because you can learn from this true story and how a young man decided to change his destiny by following his dream. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to go on  adventures through reading. It's a great book I'm glad I had the opportunity to read Into the Wild.[[ASIN:0307387178 Into the Wild]]

B00005R1N3|4.0|I love scary movies. I love Christmas movies. So a combination of the two is a windfall for me. Add \\"Juliet\\" Olivia Hussey to it, and it's even better.  This is a decent scary holiday movie that is worth watching when you're in that scary movie mood. It may rip off from other movies, but movies of this genre often rip off from each other, so no big deal.  Hussey is always a joy to watch. Her career was strange, what with her being absent for periods of time, then popping up in strange things.  The script is predictable but suspenseful, the acting is good, the mood is right. Scary holiday movie checklist - it's all there. This movie won't always be available, so if you're interested in it, you might want to get it sooner rather than later.
