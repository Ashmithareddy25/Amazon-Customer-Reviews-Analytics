B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it was very imaginative.  Though it seems to be one of a series, I think one could read just this book and still be able to understand the premise and story line.  The other books in this series would be interesting to read, also.

0988262592|5.0|This books gives me flashbacks of bad memories to the days I managed DBA team and was intimately involved in handling emergencies, writing incident reports and supporting heroic efforts of database upgrades, application deployments and complex dependencies, occasionally being discovered for the first time during  the deployment night. However, this is exactly what makes this book a fascinating read for everyone in IT. We all had been through our own horror phoenix projects and can well relate!<br />It is written as a novel and takes a reader through the discovery of Kanban process,  WIP limits, need of change management process, dev and ops collaboration. One of the few technical books that completely grabs your attention! Highly recommended!
B00F91H666|2.0|High action, little suspense: The movie wastes no time getting to the action and never lets up. You will NOT be bored but that is just a ruse to distract you from the film's many flaws. There is a little suspense in the beginning but once the initial situation is resolved the film prevents you from caring about any character in the movie, even the star(more on that below).<br /><br />Horror Movie?: No. This is an action movie with Zombies.<br /><br />The Invincible Action Hero: Its IMPOSSIBLE to be fearful for someone who survives hordes of zombies, car crashes and plane crashes with barely a scratch. That being said, I like Brad Pitt and his performance is the only thing keeping this movie from getting 1 star.<br /><br />Tsunami of Zombies: The monsters look like CGI cartoons... which is exactly what they are. That's about as scary as an army of Spongebobs.<br /><br />The Book: I hear it is better than the movie but isn't that normally the case? At any rate having not read the book i get to judge this film solely on the merits of it's entertainment value.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Your not missing anything special by not watching this movie but its not going to kill you if you do. Kinda like eating Grits.

B004WESFZW|4.0|This Philip K Dick adaptation posits a world in which anonymous suit becladded men work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the world continues `as per plan'.  Whose plan?  The movie doesn't go there - just says that `You call it by many names'.  These suits ensure the minutiae of life are engineered such that a lost set of keys or a spilt cup of coffee ensure you get where you should be at the right time.. or keep you from where you shouldn't be.  When by accident one of those spilt cups of coffee doesn't happen, a relationship is built between Damon and Emily Blunt, and the suits intervene - how far will he go to stay with the woman he has come to love?<br />The leads really convince.. Matt Damon is thoroughly likeable, and the romance never seems forced.. ironically enough, given the context.  The design of the movie has a persistent kind of art deco quality, giving it a sort of timeless quality.  The `suits' are conveyed convincingly enough by Tony Slattery (Mad Men) and Anthony Mackie, with Terence Stamp coming in for the final act.  The resolution is not quite as exciting as it thinks it is, and dodges too many of the intriguing questions such a premise suggests. The movie is not the mash-up the front cover suggests when it says \\"Bourne meets Inception\\".. it's not got Bourne like action or grit, and it's not mind warping like Inception, or as reliant on effects.  There is a mash-up going on here though, and the question is how well does it work.  As a romantic thriller, there is chemistry, drama and tension enough to work.  As a sci-fi, there is an intriguing concept for you to mull over and leave you with some questions, and done seamlessly enough that we don't stop to question the logic or effects.  As a hybrid of both genres, it seems on slightly shakier ground, but classy enough and with enough joie de vivre to pull through.  Above all, if you like hats, give it a watch.<br />6 /10

B00CATSONE|3.0|This is a short read, especially if you skip one third of the book where author talks about sports and last 15%  of commercials. Tesla's life is described quite shortly. This looks more like high school essay then a serious book

B0058YPILY|4.0|Actually it was a great set of DVD'S  when I look at the disks and the first thing I look at is their quality not scratched or badly used. Even though you sell them as new sometimes there are disks that have scratches on them and that ruins the collection for viewing.<br /><br />These were in good condition and of course I like the price that I paid for them and the delivery time in which they arrived was also really good.

1423113462|2.0|This second series has traveled a long path away from Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The originality is there, yes, with the brilliant twist of Greek and Roman counterparts. The use of actual mythology as well. However, if you've read the Percy Jackson series, you must have been endeared with the masterful 1st-person point-of-view of Riordan. You could feel the weight of Percy's POV decisions while second-guessing the other characters' unvoiced thoughts. This Heroes of Olympus first book does NOTHING to get your mind thinking. It shifts from one point of view to another and this method really lets out too too much information. Can't this information be discovered slowly? Cause it felt like a mass of forced information that tried too hard to draw readers in.  The romance factor. In the original series, love was present but not a blindingly obvious factor of the story. Sure you could SOMEWHAT assume Percy liked Annabeth. But you couldn't be sure about anything. Like if Annabeth liked him more than a friend at all. This second series (I have read the second book as well) is nonstop about couples. I swear.. if I hear another 'oh they should just get together already,'......  I would like to think readers can figure out the romantic interests. It doesn't have to be pointed out. In the original series, it was teased. It was slowly building and it was beautiful how you could read Percy and Annabeth's journey from strangers, to innocent true friends, to finally becoming a couple. There were more important priorities than thinking about 'just get together already!' Like c'mon.... My girlfriend this, my boyfriend that. Yeah yeah we get it.  There was also an emphasis on appearances. Saying someone is 'good looking', or if that person is not good looking, then he or she is a redeeming 'cute' like a teddy bear. DOES EVERYONE HAVE TO BE GOOD LOOKING?   The wonderful Riordan sarcasm was missing as well. It appeared faintly in Leo but the 3rd-person POV really eliminated the closeness we felt with Percy when he was directing the story. Sure we see more sides of the story, but in turn, a reader really does feel distant from the plot and characters.  If you bothered to read this, Thank you. I'm not a writer and this is just an opinion. I can go on and on about my dissatisfaction... but I'm fervently hoping Riordan somehow switches back to 1st-person-POV, gives Jason some character flaws, and ends all this couple talk. I mean who didn't love the start of Percy and Annabeth's relationship in the Last Olympian? I did. But they earned it. There was no hints that they would actually get together. This series is all about the obvious.

B0089LOKHG|4.0|While the book leaves an open ending, it also closes it. The series took me through all emotions. I couldn't read the series fast enough!
B00009W0U4|5.0|There has been quite a lot of hype and controversy surrounding Gaspar Noe's \\"Irreversible\\" and in all this the amazing, powerful, and thought-provoking film has been lost. It is true this film is not for the faint of heart but I could say that for many films (Requiem for a Dream, The Passion of the Christ etc.). That does not mean you should steer clear of this film but be aware of what you are getting yourself into.<br /><br />On to the actual film:<br /><br />The film is a story of love and tragedy one that transcends all levels of hate. This film is so far beyond just a rape and revenge film, such as \\"I spit on your grave\\". While watching this film I felt myself not overcome with anger but with compassion and sadness. The amount of emotion and atmosphere this film evokes is unmatched. It is true that there are scenes in this film that are quite graphic and disturbing but nothing feels out of place or exploitive and everything has a point. The film is told in reverse chronological order of the events of one night which changed the lives of the characters forever, which is extremely effective and deliberate. The amount of intensity and dark atmosphere the film starts out with is slowly and eventually explained as the movie plays out and as we become acquainted with the characters. All of the dialogue in the film foreshadows what is yet to come but we already know what is yet to come from watching. All of the pieces fall into place and we begin to heartbreakingly realize the truth behind it all. The cinematography is beautiful and as the film would still be impactful if it was shot the way most films are it is made far more impactful by the single shot technique which whips around in a way that almost displays the emotion of the scene. It goes without saying that the acting is brilliant and Monica Bellucci is heroic for taking on her role.<br /><br />The film's atmosphere and music goes from hell to heaven in a rapid change of events but we are left with the dreadedfeeling knowing that the film has actually gone from heaven to hell over the course of this night. The elated and dreaded feeling you will feel when the final words flash across the screen is one that can't be described.<br /><br />I do not want to give away any more of the story line for fearing it will lessen the impact of the film. If this film is something you can take on watch it. If you plan on fast forwarding through the graphic scenes DO NOT watch it, the film will lose a massive amount of its impact.<br /><br />Noe has created a masterpiece here and one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.<br /><br />10/10
B00871C09S|5.0|One of Hitchcock&#34;s best movies. Jimmy Stewart is excellant and and Raymond Burr looks so young. Highly recommend to any movie lover.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|A great visual novel with some puzzles to keep things interesting. It had one of the craziest twists I've seen, only possible on the DS.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Yes--highly.  Elizabeth Gilbert is a goddess!  If you'da told me I'da enjoyed a novel about a family of botanists, I'd have thunk you Barbara Kingsolver.  The only reason I'm reading this is because I so enjoyed Eat Pray Love.  It's been a while since I've gotten traction on a book, such that I actually look forward to returning to it, and this is just such a book.  Dickensian in scope.  Austen-like in ideology.  And just plain enjoyable.  Plants!  Who knew that they could be so fascinating--but it's really the people that study them, and their rich lives, that Gilbert focuses on.  Don't equivocate.  Don't deliberate--dive in and enjoy one of the most richly peopled books in literary memory, recounted by a master writer.
B00007KWHG|5.0|The quality of ALL the CD’s that I have purchased and received is EXCELLENT. The AutoRip is a great tool which allows me to listen to the CD selections before making the purchase.

There is nothing to dislike and the songs selections are very impressive. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|THE BAT - the first inspector Harry Hole novel - is about a Norwegian cop who travels to Australia to investigate the grisly murder of a Norwegian female living abroad in Sydney. Harry, working with the Sydney police, soon realizes that he's hunting a serial killer and people on the police force and in the community know a lot more than they're willing to talk about.<br /><br />This was my first time reading Jo Nesbo and to be honest the first half of the book moved kind of slow and seemed to drag on. There was a lot of backstory on various topics: racism in Australia against aborigines, the gay population and neighborhoods in Sydney, and tidbits from the past about Harry and various other characters that he meets - but there wasn't much progress or action regarding the murder investigation. However, about halfway through the book the pacing suddenly picks up and the author melds all those backstories into one strong narrative that finishes as a terrific mystery / thriller.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in this book - the writing is outstanding, the dialogue is sharp (especially considering it's a translation from the original work), and there's some great insight into human nature and motivations. It's a very cerebral book - the protagonist, flaws and all, struggles against his demons and makes some serious mistakes along the way, but he doesn't luck or back into a solution. It's not a neat and tidy, everything falls miraculously into place type book with a happy ending - it's dark with plenty of twists that lead Harry to observe: \\"Human nature is a vast, dark forest.\\"<br /><br />All in all, it's a great book and I look forward to reading the other books in the series.
B0012DT9VK|3.0|Anybody who grew up with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory probably has images of what tht world looked like. For the most part, director Tim Burton sticks to the formula, but I can't imagine anyone ever thought that Willie Wonka, owner of the factory, ever looked like James Dean, the young Marlon Brando, Steve McQueen, Ryan O'Neal, Michael J. Fox, or... Johnny Depp. So Burton gets Depp to work his usual magic, i.e. model a character after a well-known character from popular culture - it had worked in the Keith Richard-inspired Jack Sparrow character from Pirates of the Carribean, so for Tim Burton why not deconstruct.... Michael Jackson! And so, added into the story are all sorts of clumsy flashbacks to Willie's childhood, and allow Willie to reconcile with his father (Christopher Lee, harkening back to Burton's treatment of Edward Scissorhands and another icon from old horror films, Vincent Price - hey, Burton and Depp aren't creative geniuses, they're self-plagiarizers!). None of this was in the book as I recall, where Willie Wonka was wacky, self-confident, and a little dangerous. In fact, I seem to remember the mean kids being disposed of permanently, quite sinister. The highlight of the film, besides Charlie himself and his unfortunate family, are the Oompa Loompas, played by a single actor. Nice touch, Tim. But if it had been me, I might have cast Kirk Douglas as Willie Wonka.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I actually had all three books cancelled off my Kindle. I do not enjoy reading smut like those books turned out to be.and don't even want to finish these interviews
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I was really looking forward to a movie with what I thought was an interesting story line.  It turned out to  be ridiculously boring with very little story line and some lame acting.  Hollywood obviously put some big bucks behind this movie after having invested in an A+ cast as far as sex appeal, but it could not overcome a poor script, half-hearted acting and slow pacing.  My son bought this as a birthday present for me, so I REALLY, REALLY WANTED to like it, but I even got the impression that Channing Tatum was embarrassed being in the film.  I'll leave other reviewers to sum up \\"the plot\\" because I'm not really sure what the point was except to make money.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|Love it!! I have loved this group since they came out with their first cd! Always amazing stuff! Love them! Cant wait to hear what they come out with next!!
B005LAIHPE|3.0|This is just a fun, mindless movie with lots of fantastic special effects but very little plot.  What you see is what you get...no multi-layered story here.  Taylor Kitsch is a goof-off who gets into the navy and stumbles into being the leader on a battleship.  Very powerful aliens begin attacking earth with mega-watt fire-power.  Their technology far out reaches ours, of course.  Lian Neesom adds some credibility with his A+ acting chops and Rhianna does very well for her first time out as an actor.  I really appreciated that they used a paraplegic actor as a vet who plays a part is fighting the aliens.  It is pretty much non-stop action, which is fun, but this could have been so much more.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Purchased: October 1, 2013 @ 2:20 AM<br />Started: October 1, 2013 @ 2:30 AM<br />Finished: October 3, 2013 @ 5:30 AM<br /><br />Well, lets' see... certainly a page turner (or flipper, if you read e-books :P). For the first few chapters, I felt as though I had picked up a copy of Lord of the Flies what with the extremely similar setting of a troupe of young boys having to survive on their own and end up establishing a make-shift hierarchy to maintain a slight bit of order. This book was continuously intriguing.<br /><br />I hated and loved the way the author ended each chapter as if it were a cliff hanger.. thus making it nearly impossible to put it down and go to sleep. Actually, for me, it was impossible! I only realized I had taken a break from reading when I awoke with my e-reader against my chest. I am slightly confused with the ending. It just seems to have left me with more questions that I planned on having at this point. *sigh* I suppose it is on to The Scorch Trials and, hopefully, more answers than questions! Highly recommend this book.. but I also suggest you take breaks for sleeping. ;)<br /><br />And a side note: I understand that the boys sent to the Glade were supposed to be named after super intelligent people. I get Thomas (Edison), Alby (Einstein) and Newt (Newton)... BUT.. what about Minho? Who is he named after? And the girl, Teresa.. as in Mother Teresa? Ugh! I just can't figure it out.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Who ever is wondering if they should get this game i'd say yeah get it. This game is good for people that enjoy childish games. I love my little pony so i love this game. Also i like how the time that it takes to build things or create something doesn't take long. (:
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Purchased: October 3, 2013 @ 6:35 AM<br />Started: October 3, 2013 @ 6:45 AM<br />Finished: October 4, 2013 @ 5:45 PM<br /><br />James Dashner is an extremely talented author! I usually average one week to read a book cover-to-cover.. however, I completed The Maze Trials in just over 48 hours and now The Scorch Trials in just under 36 hours.<br /><br />I am usually terrible at book reviews since I find it difficult to review without spoiling the ending or important details. So, I would like to share my feelings on the style of writing and how it affected me...<br /><br />I am an extremely claustrophobic person! There is a point in The Scorch Trials where two characters are hiding. The author's description of this scene was so realistic, I literally found myself on my feet (still reading as I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen) and I was pacing in my living room. Very few movies and never, until this one, have any books affected me this way. James Dashner is beyond talented in his use of the English language. It doesn't seem forced or rushed (although I admit.. I wouldn't have minded if he had rushed the hiding scene a tidbit.. LOL!).<br /><br />I just purchased The Death Cure and am so anxious to begin! However, I am forcing myself to take a break mainly for what the characters usually break for - bathroom, food and sleep. What do you know? They really are necessities of life! Another reason I am beginning to adore this author.. so many authors tend to forget the basic needs of their characters. It has frustrated me countless times in the past to read nearly an entire novel and not once did the main character (or any characters, for that matter) ever used the facilities. Sad. Funny how that works.. I feel connected to Thomas and Minho and Newt and all the others because they are described as relate-able.. as humans.. almost real. In fact, if it wasn't for the outlandish circumstances these kids have been finding themselves in so far, I would darn near think they were. Props, Dashner, props.they were. Props, Dashner, props.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  This group is one of my favorites and I love their music.  Arrived as promised and in a very quick amount of time.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|This is a hard review to leave. It would've been easier if I hadn't seen the show incredibly loosely based on this book. It's hard to keep in mind it is a memoir, now a genius piece of fiction. Here goes.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS.<br />]<br />It is a good thing that Ms. Kerman is fully aware she is WASP-y, because she reads as almost a caricature of such. Everyone in her world is rich, is beautiful, but totally open minded and supportive and loves her so much. She is an object of desire everywhere she goes, and did you know, she has blonde hair and blue eyes and is pretty attractive? If not, she will be more than happy to remind you about thirty five times throughout the book. It is uneventful (again, a memoir, not fiction, I understand) and I fail to see how Piper has truly grown as a person during her journey. I feel like if she isn't ignored or frightened by those \\"below her,\\" she is patronizing them. They are mostly used as devices to completely compliment Ms. Kerman's 'tight ass', or 'tv titties' or just general perfection. I don't want this to be a review attacking her character, I am sure she is an incredibly nice person, but it's hard not to when the book is written in her point of view with her insight and spin on things. It would've been a little bit refreshing to see her actual feelings other than being creeped out by the legion of people who wanted to bone her, or the passive-aggressive use of the word bulldyke (maybe I am behind on the times and that is something considered PC). Feelings that proved she was actually human, that is, and not a wonderful, open minded, selfless person despite the fact she clearly has a really inflated sense of self. The whole thing just felt very insincere, I guess, which is what's most frustrating. I didn't know it'd be so easy to like the Piper character in the series after reading this book!<br /><br />Danbury sounds like a huge slumber party, which I guess is understandable thinking back after experiencing OklahmomaCity and Chicago's facilities. It was an interesting look through a different pair of eyes, but something felt like it was cleaned up and not very honest. Now put the book down and go watch the genius series on NETFLIX. Does not disappoint!
B0027I93U6|5.0|Best series in a very long time. Brilliant character development. I just saw the final episode of season 8 and am now RE-watching all episodes. Seeing some things I didn't notice first time around and things like how Deb started out and how much she changed are quite amazing when looking back this way.<br /><br />Highly recommend this entire collection. Season 2 is when we see signs at first of Deb 'breaking away' and becoming the woman we later grow to love in a different way.<br /><br />Dexter is wonderful as his usual disturbing funny self.
0143119680|5.0|excellent read.  History is dead on.  Strongly recommend this book and its sequel.  Waiting for the concluding book to be released.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm so happy that I watched the first season when they had it on netflix or I might have never seen it. I don't have cable and I saw it there and thought I'll give it a go for curiosities sake. So glad I did, it's one of the best shows out there currently. I'm so tired of seeing all these awful, demeaning and down right dumb reality shows. I love the era they chose, so much happens and is not a time discussed enough. And the fact they have so many characters and they are able to make them interesting and real, and keep up with it all is impressive. And such wonderful characters, that I never cried so hard in my life for a show or film as I did when Sybil died. And it takes a lot for me to do so. I had to watch the whole thing with a box of tissues. In fact I was so distressed that they killed one of my favorite characters that I wasn't sure if I could continue watching. But couldn't stay away, I had to continue it's that good. And unfortunately it looks like I'm in for a lot more tears but I'm hooked. I'm ready for the 4th season and was aggravated that I have to wait til January for the DVD. Oh well, I've got my husband intrigued now I think so we may watch the first season together. I warned him to be patient because the first few episodes are slow to start but it's building the world, and the many characters and introducing you to the life they are coming from. Then....wham...it gets awesome.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This looks like a good quality product...<br /><br />Sorry , I haven't  had a chance to use it as yet.<br /><br />Don
080701429X|5.0|Interesting reading and raises some points for consideration, especially in light of what the author endured during WW II. If you enjoy philosophy and questioning the &#34;why&#34; of things, this book would be a good read. Easy to read and a quick one but raises the questions/points in such a way as to leave you pondering them even after concluding the chapter or book as a whole.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|There nothing like the original cast and crew of Star Trek.  They are the ones that first captured my attention as a young man.  This is good movie!  I recommend that you give it a watch!
140006922X|4.0|Zealot is interesting and engaging, but after finishing the book I don't feel like I've learned a whole lot about Jesus.  Rather, this book seems to be more about the time and place that Jesus lived in, and his community following his death.  That alone is very important for people to understand.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this book, but I did feel that at times Aslan was really making a leap in his logic.  It seemed like the evidence just wasn't strong enough for some of the claims he was making.  Perhaps it was there, but not fully communicated.  Some points seemed to be stretched a lot.  But I really enjoyed how he broke down the historical flaws in the crucifixion story, and what he had to say about Paul and James following Jesus' death.<br /><br />I am not a Christian, but it seems as though this book reaffirms many Christian teachings and seems to strengthen Christianity's core message and traditional belief of Jesus.  In my eyes, there really isn't much fundamental difference between the New Testament Jesus and the Jesus Aslan depicts.  Aslan does, however, criticize Paul greatly and I believe the criticism is well deserved.
B000GOWNPU|4.0|Good story, great graphics and actors did a good job.  I recommend that you watch this movie.  You may like it as well!
B0025KVLS8|5.0|Totally Fab4! As good or better than I remember seeing when it first came out so many years ago. Danced and sang along, feeling 16 all over again.
1400063515|3.0|I like a dry, math/statistics-heavy book every now and then and that's why this book was even remotely interesting to me other than the actual concept itself. The actual concept is always a great thing to keep in mind whether you're an  entrepreneur like me or just trying to cover all your bases in life.<br />But the actual scholarship and statistical explanation seems to be aimed at a very obscure audience so I don't expect much to come out of this book that will impact the wider culture anytime soon; which is too bad because I think research like this leads us all to question the typical assumptions in life and embrace more grey areas in everything. I do think this was referenced in an episode of the TV show \\"Numb3rs\\"?<br />If you like seemingly endless and droning mathematical ponderings - I think you'll love this book. If you have to read this book as part of a course syllabus- you have my unending sympathy. If you're reading this just for leisure, you're either a mathlete so good for you or you'll find yourself having to will yourself to finish it like I did. Again, a good read but definitely could've been translated better for us non-mathletes!<br />Again, the whole black swan concept is really good to keep in mind and reminds me of a great part of the movie \\"World War Z\\" when the concept of the Israeli \\"Tenth man\\" comes into play- so awesome and again, really good to keep in mind!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|One word sums up this book, \\"Epic\\". The remaining words entered here are to meet the silly word number requirements.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Luving this AWESOME game... Just wish we could buy more things with BANANAS or be able to collect more coins in the game....
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|My girls liked it so much because it was so much fun to watch and they loved the interesting story!

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|What a beautiful love story this was. Sad for many reasons but at the same time a wonderful ending for a young loving couple.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan for a lot of years.  And this one was as satisfying a read as his other great books.
B005ZI306S|5.0|A very cleverly written book in rhyme that will make children laugh over some of the silly little tales.  It is an unusual  book but the little child in me enjoyed it.  What a fun book for children to read themselves or with the help of their parents.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by this author and I look forward to seeing what else he will write.
B0073L91MW|3.0|An episode of the war that I didn't know about, but was interestingly told. So this is what Ian Fleming was involved with. Reminds the audience of some of the hardships faced by the soldiers. No winter clothing, poor communication, extraction upon pleading. Still at war, but big differences.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it!!! its my adiccion!it was great if can you have more life and more opportunity to have cash for minions
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|As I was reading this book, I'd have to stop and tell friends about how funny it was.  I was wondering if it was tickling me so much having an \\"Aspie\\" son or if it was just darn funny. I guess I'm like Don - I need help in identifying emotions. I read some of the 1-star and 2-star reviews and was shocked - how could they not understand this was the most amusing thing to read since \\"Where'd You Go, Bernadette?\\" The construction of the questionnaire, and the identifiers of who he meets (short-skirted cleaner, Fat Baseball Fan,etc,)and above all the scene where he's giving the lecture on Autism made me snicker, made me giggle and made laugh out loud with tears. Of course it will be a movie and the movie will stink because the book is too good and the movie will be trite. Sure, escaping from a fourth floor office will make for a slapstick scene, but don't know how they're going to capture the writing - of how Don sees the world, his labeling of events (Jacket Incident, Balcony Meal), his lists, how he mentally sorts out emotion and feelings.  It is my wish Graeme Simsion avoid \\"Movie Project\\" and commence \\"Next Book Project.\\"
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Truly a compelling read. I love Child's Jack Reacher series and this is no exception. Pick it up for an exciting read.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|fantastic yarn great acting holds you all the way judi dench was magic.this is not bolly wood it is much much more
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|Black and white can't hide the lack of believability in most of the acting. The attempt to jam yet another Shakespeare work into a modern context failed to propel the story in any new way. Instead, the actors seemed to be working to remain casual, hip, and modern while not stumbling over the old english. None of the love connections created any spark of chemistry. Very unmemorable. One star bonus for creative camera work and the party montage. Refund please?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you have been a faithful follower of Stephen King's books over the years reading \\"Dr. Sleep\\" begins to feel a bit like a class reunion. However, this is one of the later ones where everyone has lived enough of life to be past the pretense, insecurity and has finally figured out the real priorities in life.<br /><br />This novel showcases all the reasons I read Mr. King's books while I was housebound raising three children on the farm in the 70's and 80's.  The Stand,Cujo and many others are classics to me.  This novel is classic King in its ability to involve the reader with characters, make the unbelievable believable and give you a hero to cheer for as good defeats evil even though you can't be sure how he'll do it til the end.  I also read this book with a bit of symbolism perhaps because I and Stephen King are of the same generation.  So I wonder if we both haven't thought a bit about how many years are ahead of us compared to how many are now gone.  So The True offer a tempting proposition, don't they?  Hmmmm...think I'll pass on buying that Winnebago though.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|As there are so little quality programs on TV, this series was a breath of fresh air! Cast of characters and the intertwining of their lives at this period in history is so well done. I rushed to order season 3 and have savored every episode. Bravo and thank you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Love the challenge. My daughter also loves game. Keeps her entertained. Great for all ages. Would recommend for families
1469259168|5.0|What a powerful story!  I know it is marketed to young adults and I am anything but young, but I was so drawn into middle school life like I was back there again.  The characters were multidimentional, the lessons were universal, the ending was a tearjerker.
B002QYNIHU|4.0|I bought this Goku, because it looks very well made and when I got it, I confirmed it, but what I did not like were the articulations because I do not know how to explain it but he moves kind of awkward, and for this problem it is impossible that a kid plays with it, this toy is only made to put in a \\"position\\" (like the kamehameha or the tele transportation pose) and look at it, and this is not a problem for me because I collect toys, but I would suggest to Bandai to change the way they make the articulations, take for example the figures of SAO (Kirito and Asuna), they have a lot of articulations, and also you can change their faces, but they are better made, and it is way more difficult to brake them.  Here is the Kirito ([[ASIN:B00APDUDD6 Figma Sword Art Online Kirito]] and the Asuna ([[ASIN:B00AXV01VE figma Sword Art Online Asuna]]
B00BE909NO|4.0|Good reading makes you think . Can't imagine something like that happening right under our nose. A couple of hours plan trip away.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|VERY SENSATIONAL DUE TO SUBJECT MATTER BUT VERY POORLY WRITTEN. THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I COULDN;T BELIEVE THE IMMATURITY OF THE WRITER AND THE POOR TASTE OF THE READER, INCLUDING ME.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|I FOUND THE BOOK VERY INTERESTING. I BOUGHT AN IMAX AFTER READING IT BECAUSE I WAS SO IMPRESSED. UNFORTUNATELY,  IT IS NOT THAT EASY TO USE AS THE BOOK LED YOU TO BELIEVE. STILL, I LOVE MY APPLE COMPUTER..
B00B4804KS|5.0|this movie was really good in 3d, a lot more scary, i would definitely recommend it. we have the regular jurassic park.
1594481717|2.0|Great concepts. Good ideas, Not a lot of detail and at times it was overly wordy without actually saying much. One has to wonder if there was a minimum word contract for the writer
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|the best 3d movie i have seen, and i have a lot of 3d movies. Yes i would recommend it. A MUST SEE, IN 3D
B000VZSOI4|5.0|I like it because it's a real book and not a fake one, and the color looks good on me.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|There were many tantalizing themes on achievement but my key takeaway was that I liked the author's contrast about private schools vs public schools.  Bravo to those that take the &#34;riskier&#34; public option!
0945353731|5.0|The diary of Anne Frank was one of the most poignant and memorable accounts of an episode from the horror that led to and included World War II.  This small girl, with a massive spirit, intelligence, sensitivity and talent, wrote of her experience with her family, spirited away into a concealed compartment of a neighbor's house to keep them from the clutches of a despotic regime led by a fanatic named Hitler, bent on the extermination of all Jewish people.  It capsulizes the hopes, drams, affections, love of friends and family that represent youth, and a young girl discovering life.  Julie Harris, with her huge capacity for understanding and portraying the kind of spirit Anne Frank possessed, is one of very few actresses who could possibly portray this diary in the way it was written.  This is a monumental treasure of both the narrative and the talent of a great actress.
B005COO1X6|4.0|i liked the book. i dont know at this point if it is one of his older ones, but it wasnt so way off. i used to read all his books 20 years ago and then he lost me.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|It is one of the funniest card games that I have ever played, I liked it a lot, keep up the good work!
140006922X|5.0|Very well-written. I learned many new things about the origin of the Scriptures in this book, plus a glimpse at who Jesus really was. One needs an open mind to unlearn some dogma before accepting Reza Azlan's conclusions, but after reading this, I admire Jesus even more, as does the author.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game! It gives me an outlet for my logical side just like logic problems in puzzle mags used to.
0811879542|5.0|GREAT&#60; GREAT&#60; GREAT book for every teacher and grandparent to own.  My press here finger is worn out and I could read it again.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Does justice to the franchise! No disappointment for Star Trek fans old and new alike.  I am looking forward to more movies and possibly rebooting a new ST TV series.

0307744434|5.0|This story is unique.  I read so much that very little catches me off guard, but this was a wonderful tale full of surprises, twists and turns.  The Night Circus is quite the imaginative little world.

B000V6583C|5.0|What Parents Need to Know<br /><br />Parents need to know that this album contains some angry sometimes confrontational lyrics.  While the singles that received airplay on pop radio may not contain any swear words, other tracks pack a wallop with strong language.  The song \\"Rocket Queen\\" has become the notorious song when the lead singer tried to jump on a spectator at a concert who was photographing the concert.  Expect a fair amount of strong language and violent images with some sex.<br /><br />Positive Messages 0/5<br /><br />Aggression and anger dominate this album.<br /><br />Violence 3/5<br /><br />Several tracks include violent images and themes or angry confrontation.  Bleeding & dying mentioned throughout.<br /><br />Sex 1/5<br /><br />A Little Sexual innuendo<br /><br />Language 3/5<br /><br />Four Letter words scattered about<br /><br />Consumerism 2/5<br /><br />A few brands mentioned<br /><br />Drinking, drugs & Smoking 4/5<br /><br />Some songs mention smoking and drinking.  Mr. Brownstone is about heroin.<br /><br />What's the story?<br /><br />excellent, some say classic guitar work meets troubling sometimes violent lyrics about dealing with altercations violently.  Sure people may define this album may be a classic but you would not want to let your ten year old listen to this album and repeating some of the lyrical content in their class room.  Axl Rose sings sometimes shouts aggressive lyrics like \\"I wanna watch you bleed\\" and \\"You're gonna die\\" in the opening tune which has become the greatest hard rock song and you're kids probably heard this at any live sporting event or the Jukebox of your local sports bar.<br /><br />Is it any good 5/5 Stars<br /><br />Any guitar god wannabe probably listened to this record while practicing guitar.  More ever one in five American homes has this album in their collection so chances are that kids born from 1980 on have heard this album and almost anyone who listens to rock music heard songs from this record.  The content of many of the songs makes this an iffy choice for those families with young children as the lyrics contain a scattering of F-bombs and other swear words although there are a few songs that are innocent.  The ones that contain vulgarity pack a major punch.  However it is the guitar solos and Slash's guitar work that makes this a great album for those who like heavy metal so this album may be an excellent beginner record for those teens who like excellent hard rock.  However there is some strong drug references to be on the lookout for in Mr. Brownstone and violent images of confrontation in \\"Out to Get Me\\" and \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\".  This album would be an iffy choice for the more conservative households who put lyrics under a microscope.  However for those who look beyond the confrontational nature of the lyrics and the heroin references and language can appreciate the sound of this album.<br /><br />Explore, discuss, enjoy<br /><br />Families can talk about the focus and hours of practice that go into the guitar work and how it could influence people to pick up a guitar.<br />Could artists still sell records if they tone their lyrics down to more of a family friendly tone? Why or why not?<br /><br />Artist: Guns 'N' Roses<br />Release date: July 21st, 1987<br />Label: Geffen<br />Genre: Rock<br />Parental advisory: YesThe content of many of the songs makes this an iffy choice for those families with young children as the lyrics contain a scattering of F-bombs and other swear words although there are a few songs that are innocent.

B00845MRKE|5.0|5 different versions of the film - crazy mad extras and cool little collectable spinner hover car and a small Art of Blade Runner book. Yes am a nerd/geek whatever, but you have to realize just about all the modern CGI Sci-Fi movies copy some, if not all, of their visual concepts from THIS MOVIE! To name a few Fifth Element, Total Recall reboot, I Robot, Minority Report, Judge Dredd Reboot...just about anything with flying cars, overcrowd culturally diverse modern cityscapes and heart-thumping jumping from building to building chase scenes. If it was made after 1982, they probably were at least influenced by this movie. Way ahead of its time and no computer generated anything, Blade Runner in my humble opinion, is in the top 5 Sci-Fi movies of all time, but its my personal favorite (dare I say it - even above Star Wars). OH NO HE DIDN'T! Watching it for the first time you probably couldn't tell it was made in the early 80's because the cinematography is that good. But all the actors are 31 years older now and some of the companies no loner exist (Pan Am being one of the more prominent). But a Ridley Friggin Scott film with Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos...I mean Damn! Who's bringing the popcorn?
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love the Will Robie story - I wish there were more books in this series. David Baldacci does a great job at getting you hooked on the suspense, the mystery, and the relationships happening in the background!
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Its a funnier version of Mansfield Park. The main character speaks directly to you in the DVD.  Great buy it.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|It was riveting to the last page! It was a great read, I love the developing relationship/friendship/professionalism between Michelle and Sean!

B00F35B8F8|1.0|The acting is just fair the guy who plays Scotty has real problems with the dialect to the point that it is distracting. The action in the first 7 minutes of the movie belies the lack of action to come.  Worse than anything the premise is very very weak. Don't pay too much to see this just wait till you can watch it for a dollar and that would be fair.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game for all ages. Fun for quick play or for passing a chunk of time. I would recommend to friends and family.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This was a great movie, finally a zombie movie with a good plot. Once it starts it just keeps going til the end!
B00BV0FK58|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read the original 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman, so this was a refreshing re-read that reminded me of many of the finer details I've forgotten. But I was impressed with this version for military couples. Not only is every example in the book from a military family, but the authors added in great suggestions to help spouses cover deployments. This book is definitely an asset to military marriages who want to do more than just survive their active duty time.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not like the first book this tried to have a plot, but it came at the end of the story so you would want to read the third book.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I've read several of Sophie Kinsella' s books. This one follows pretty much the same pattern as the others. Girl does some pretty outrageous things which in turn causes some stuffy guy to fall completely in love with her. However, I did like this one better than some of her other books.  I loved all the characters, especially Sadie.<br /><br />Spoiler alert<br />My only complaint was, I found myself wondering how much. You can copy another story and not break copyright laws. It was so similar to the story line of Titanic. Girl meets boy, who paints her wearing nothing but a necklace, family is scandelized. Boy is sent away and dies. Girl marries someone she does not love, out of revenge. OK, granted, the necklace in Titanic is a heart pendant and the necklace in this book is a dragonfly necklace. And I guess no one was on a sinking ship But really?<br /><br />But aside from that, I did really enjoy the book and found it to be a good light read.

B000WAEJZ0|4.0|I think the voice of this woman was too powerful.  To keep up this level of singing would have been difficult on stage for any performer.  I think this was too difficult for Whitney to handle.  I just love her music, but every song I listen to reminds me of the great loss we all have experienced.  Sometimes one's gift can become a great burden.  Thankfully we can continue to enjoy her talent on cd's like this one.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Plenty of people have written summaries, so here's my low-down:<br /><br />I enjoyed this sequel to The Shining.  The story was interesting but not scary (even a little).  I never felt that the protagonists were in any real danger.  The True Knot were just what Dan and Abra called them--cowards and bottom-feeders.  Because of this, they came across as petty and not very powerful.  The final show-down was fun but lacked the chills of previous King novels.  I liked a few of the twists in the novel and enjoyed catching up with Dan, meeting his new friends, and learning about Abra.  I just wish they had had some more formidable foes to deal with.
B00E9P959E|3.0|Although this new vinyl edition does sound better in many ways to the original fidelity-wise, it's still my least favorite of Rush's releases.<br />Written 3 years after (released 4 years after) the deaths of both Peart's daughter (19) and wife (of 22 years) just 10 month's apart, followed by  much grieving and soul-searching..... it shows.<br />There's nothing very exciting for me on this release, it's pretty bland. It's not bad...... for me it's just my least favorite from the band. We all have one.

B0083SBJXS|2.0|The massive action scenes that are the heart of The Avengers just do not come across in home theater-even on a great system-as they do in a theater. Blu-Ray shows the details, but this film was shot for massive scale and thunderous sound. In normal viewing, the weaknesses of the film wear badly. The format consists of a 5 minute lecture by one of the characters about some ridiculous/complicated aspect of the story, followed by 10 minutes of massive action, then another lecture, then more action, etc. Everyone knows the characters (and the actors) from previous films, and they are introduced poorly and hardly developed at all, each given the spotlight for a minute here and there. Dialogue is terrible; the characters just mouth one ridiculous, convoluted explanation after another. Other than Thor, the characters are dull and flat, just doing the same old schtick. The film goes on forever. And ever. Even the astoundingly kinetic action scenes get boring. I'm a lifelong follower of the Avengers, liked many of the previous Marvel movies, and was predisposed to like this one. I didn't. I found \\"The Avengers\\" to be shallow and tedious, lacking any of the qualities needed to make it work in a home setting. I wanted to like this movie, thought I would, but to me it came across like Alvin and the Chipmunks on meth, playing with dynamite.  Jabber... Boom! Jabber... Boom!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan for decades and books like Doctor Sleep are responsible for that. Mr. King's character development has always been strong, and it continues in this book. The narrative rolls along at a breathtaking clip. My one complaint would be Mr. King's lack of firearms knowledge. Being the avid gun-control proponent he is, this does not come as a surprise. It does detract from his credibility, however, when he misses little details like he did. I'm sorry, sir, but Glocks do not have external safeties that can be thumbed off. You are fond of cliches, Mr. King, and the devil is in the details.

B008D28HYS|4.0|I'm having a lot of fun with this app. My biggest complaint is that the controls aren't as responsive as they should be. Sometimes when I touch a square, nothing happens. Also, some puzzles get pretty big, so I wouldn't recommend it for phones. Even my 7\\" tablet doesn't feel big enough. Fortunately, you can zoom in on the puzzles if necessary.<br /><br />One other thing is the price. $4.95 is kind of high, especially since you can get Flip Pix Art (which is similar to this app) for only $1.99. (I got both when they were Free App of the Day). However, if this app goes on sale, I would definitely recommend it.

B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Among the album’s highlights are four Stills/Shepherd/Goldberg co-writes including the barnburner “RoadHouse”—about the life of an itinerant bluesman—CSN influenced “Don’t Want Lies,” and the title track, a guitar-heavy anthem with a soul-baring lead vocal by Stills. There’s also a Crazy Horse-caliber send-up of “Rockin’ In The Free World,” and four additional covers on which Shepherd sings lead, including “Talk To Me Baby” and “Honey Bee” by Elmore James and Muddy Waters, respectively, and Iggy Pop & The Stooges’ “Search and Destroy.” The set closes with “Word Game,” a song Stills wrote during his late ’60s era with Buffalo Springfield, and which appeared on his 1971 solo album Stephen Stills 2. The album was recorded in the studio over the course of about a week at EastWest in Los Angeles, helmed by longtime Shepherd producer Jerry Harrison, a renowned musician in his own right (Talking Heads, Modern Lovers, Casual Gods) as well as a fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee. Mostly first or second takes made the album’s final cut. In addition to Chris Layton—Shepherd’s drummer, and also a veteran of Stevie Ray Vaughan’s Double Trouble—the players include bassist Kevin McCormick (CSN, Jackson Browne).
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite series now. I know it was the last book for Mr. Scalzi's trilogy but he indicated that he wasn't totally done with this universe and I certainly hope there is much more to come. I have not read the Human Divisions yet which is his most recent OMW offering but will be getting to it soon.  With such a vast number of alien races, the possibilities are boundless.<br /><br />As in book 2, the characters are familiar while the plot is new. And it is stacked very nicely on top of things from the first two books. A great series!

B009ZM76J2|5.0|Pleasantly Surprised. I give this film 5 stars. I thought it was an excellent film by a great film and would highly recommend it especially relatable to African Americans who share similar experiences.
B00E1LT41K|2.0|For starters, I could never get past the first episode because of how dull and disgusted I was with one scene in particular. The acting is good, but there were other things severely lacking in the series which also turned me off of it rather quickly.<br /><br />For starters, I was able to pick out zippers on several of the costumes. You don't like these sorts of things for immersion purposes - it takes you out of the story and you have a hard time believing what is going on is actually set back in time.<br /><br />I found the style of filming perhaps a bit odd. The picture wasn't as crisp as I would have liked it to be. The style reminded me of the series Rome, however Rome pulled it off a lot better in every way imaginable.<br /><br />Secondly one thing that really bothered me was when the main character, and her main love interest - the future king, at the time were first starting to get together.<br /><br />[spoilers for episode 1]<br />The scene bothered me because he was basically going to rape her, and the only reason he didn't was because she pulled a knife on him, and threatened to kill herself. Personally I hate when things like sexual assault are used as romance devices. Yes, this was something that frequently happened in the past. HOWEVER, how is something like this supposed to convince me that she is so in love with him, and he with her? (Yes, I am aware she actually did want to sleep with him but wasn't going to because of the fact she knew she would be easily tossed aside if she slept with him right away and because of the shame in doing so - but no means no, regardless of the character/person's reasonings for refusal and the male character should have respected that. Which would be historically inaccurate but at least it would give me a reason to actually believe in some sort of...relationship between them.) I seriously doubt a woman would fall head over heels for a man like that.<br /><br />It just totally broke immersion and offended me for personalreasons.<br /><br />Now, while I have not read the White Queen, or the series of books off of that one, I have read Phillipa Gregory's books before. So those who are saying she is historically accurate either have no idea what they're talking about or are just going off what other people are telling them. In several of her books most of the major plot points are factual but a lot of things she inputs are pure fiction. While they are historical fiction books, I'm just pointing out that this is likely the same way. It really doesn't hinder from the story for those who aren't really into the time period, but for those who are it's something that breaks the immersion.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book creates a discussion worthy of having. I thought it was the end of the world based on early reviews but I was pleasantly surprised by the balanced arguments set forth by Ms. Sandberg. A good read for working (@ home or outside) women.
B0074JOCIG|2.0|Let me start by saying I really enjoy Mr.Bonamassa's guitar playing and singing. That's where the enjoyment ends! and abruptly. Anyone who thinks this disc in, either Dolby Digital Or Master HD, sounds good DROP YOUR IPODS THIS INSTANT AND GO LISTEN TO SOME DISCS FORM THE LATE 80'S EARLY 90'S. on a system with some dynamics. This disc sounds weak. NO DYNAMICS AT ALL. ZERO. Who mixes this crap ? Members of his son's fifth grade av club? I was hoping His Black Country Communion , Live over Europe was a fluke. Unfortunately no. He just has incompetent production. Anyone hear his albums? Are they as anemic as his concert discs? These are recorded in DTS-HD MASTER AUDIO??????  B.S. the music in the menu sounds better than any of the performances on either disc. If your a fan than by all means pick this up. He is a very fun guitarist and I like the way he sings. also the songs with Beth Hart sound better than the rest of the disc...Hmmmm...wonder why...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is working good to help stream Netflix. Amazon has become my go to place for my craft and household needs.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This move was fun to watch , for the plot, and the video was good quality and at the same time filtered in a way that made it draw you in. The sound quality was quite good as well. The drones will give many of your speakers a workout.
B000002J0N|3.0|I love CSN but did not think this was one of the best. Still,their instrumentals and harmony are hard to beat.
B00D7NWTSI|2.0|Unfortunately someone decided to have more story than action and they ended up missing the boat entirely. Some fun scenes,but other than that a total let down. When am I going to learn? Rent it first and if you love it than buy it! If it turns out to be a giant turd (Like this is) Than your only out 5 or 6 bucks. Ironman 2 remains the best in the series. Ironman 1 is fun and I enjoyed how it introduced us to the iron hero, Ironman 2 took it a step further and punched up the danger without allowing EVERY FOE to kick ironman's ass. Then there's three. The worst of the lot. I would watch Green Lantern Again before I watched this movie. I don't want to give away any plot for those who might be reading this who haven't seen it suffice it to say the plot takes center stage and our &#34;hero&#34; is more vulnerable than ever. I don't want my &#34;super Heros&#34; to be vulnerabe for more than 15% of the movie. I watch them to see them overcome and kick ass! Two stars for two beautiful women and great pic+sound. Movie gets zero stars. So the over all score of two stars is an aggregate.

B009POCG2C|4.0|As with most Eastwood movies, the story is very good.  Justin Timberlake played a really good part, and Clint was crusty and obstinate (nothing new there).  Read the movie blurb for a better synopsis, but the acting, directing and story were all top-notch.

B000S1M9LY|2.0|I didn't get the jest of it.  It was unbearably tedious and, so far as I could tell, pointless.  It was a slow herd of painfully injured egos each obsessed with his own belly button, in fruitless search of a plot.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Did you ever wonder what happened to Danny Torrence from The Shining? How would you go on with your life after a childhood like that? This is Danny Torrence now. This is what happened to a child who was haunted by memories he tried to forget. It is how life keeps turning. I will never look at the Winnebagos on the highway the same way again Thanks to Mr Stephen king. He has away of taking an ordinary event and making it supernatural. Thanks again Mr King for a book I couldn't put down. It is one of the best king books in awhile!
1594202273|5.0|Overall great addition to the author's work. I love the way that the author is able to feed me history while weaving a much larger tale. The book is exciting. Going into it from Reefer Madness and Fast Food Nation I had no clue what I was in store for. I basically just went for the book because I like the author. Lets just say I was blown away. While some parts did get a little technical, its hard for me to see how they couldn't. The guy is trying to explain complex science, but keeping it basic enough so that most anyone can understand. I can't build an atomic bomb, but after reading this the principles of how it was done are clear. This is a stark reminder of the danger that mankind introduced into this world with the creation of nuclear weapons. If you liked the author's way of writing in his past books, then you'll like this book. He keeps that same investigative reporting style that made Reefer Madness and Fast Food Nation such fun reads. Pick it up if you want a history lesson on our entry into the Nuclear era. And standby for some riveting, page turning, real life stories that will leave you shocked and worried.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I've been reading the Nigh Huntress since my wife recommended the series to me and it's a good action packed series that is a pretty easy read.  The characters in the story are easy to follow and keep track of and the plot stays consistent throughout the series.

B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game a lot and recommend it to many. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's  to hard  to get the crystals needed to buy  things  ad  because  it's hard to get the extra items needed for every time you explore certain rooms.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Although this lacks the surprise of the Shining..I found it very interesting to follow Dan on through his later life. I'm wondering if we will learn of the new character Abra as I would be interested in what happens to her. I feel as if I've out grown the horror jaundra somewhat, but Stephen King is always a good read.

B0040HO16S|5.0|Lark Rise to Candle Ford is a well done period drama. The plots of integrity, justice and nobility ring through out this moving drama, a superb cast too.
1476727651|5.0|The inherent danger in writing a long-delayed sequel--and especially one to something as beloved as \\"The Shining\\"--is that a sub-par result might cheapen the original. Trap Danny Torrance in a spooky Detroit Best Western, in other words, and you risk diminishing the power held by the Overlook.<br /><br />Thankfully, Stephen King's \\"Doctor Sleep\\" avoids these traps entirely. King's sequel to \\"The Shining\\" continues the universe of the original, but does not dwell in the boundaries or themes of its predecessor; as King explains in the postscript, the novel answers the question, \\"What is Danny Torrance up to now?\\", but sees fit to wander far from the original premise.<br /><br />A taut affair, \\"Doctor Sleep\\" begins with Danny--now Dan--echoing some of the less fortunate tendencies of his father, deep in the same alcoholic dependency that provided \\"The Shining's\\" earthbound context. At the same time, it expands the supernatural setting of the original. The central conceit of \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is that Dan's eponymous power--previously shared between him and Mr. Halloran--is less uncommon than one might assume. Lots of people shine, some a little and some a little more, while yet others have powers like Dan's. And--without delving too much into spoilers--these powers also attract the attention of some who have less-than-benevolent designs on the men, women, and (especially) children who possess them.<br /><br />The antagonists of \\"Doctor Sleep\\" are a wonderful creation, continuing King's fascination with combining the mundane and the supernatural. They are more bizarre than the manifested dead of the original (although those Overlook revenants have a few guest appearances, especially near the beginning). Yet King shows an admirable amount of restraint, refusing to define them more than need be--so that by the time of the final showdown, a reader is still guessing as to the true extent of their abilities and malevolence.<br /><br />\\"Doctor Sleep\\" is a sequel, but with a few tweaks it could be part of an entirely different King universe. Those areas it shares are welcome, imbuing the story with a degree of familiarity that some late-arriving revelations further cement. I devoured it in a few short days, and I imagine that most King devotees will do the same.

0316228583|5.0|An amazing, sad, loving book about people who can be weak, blind, conceited, and some of them redeemed. It talks about the tragedy of life that beats one down and about the magic of resilience and love.<br /><br />In the beginning, only three out of 25 people I \\"met\\" in Pagford seemed pleasant human beings in whose company I wanted to spend the rest of the book. But keep reading! By the middle the people of Pagford turned out to be deeper and more complex than I initially judged them - as often happens in life.<br /><br />My favorite characters were the five teenagers, described with great love, understanding, and sometimes admiration; of course Krystal Weedon carries the day.  The adults are described with uncanny and scary clarity. J.K. Rowling mercilessly dissects their motivations, Tolstoy style (if you  appreciate character descriptions in Anna Karenina then you will appreciate Casual Vacancy).<br /><br />Be patient, get through the beginning, where Rowling takes her time to introduce the characters and set the scene. You will be rewarded. It is an excellent, excellent book.

B00E7SFAAG|2.0|Real repetitive and it gets sort of boring because of that. I'd like to see more variety in the levels and perhaps updates for your character to make them go faster or skate better. Make it so you are actually working for something instead of lame power ups you will rarely/never use.
1451695195|5.0|Wonderful to hear of heaven through a non-believer's eyes.  If you are a doubter, of this phenomonen, this is for you
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was so amazing! I absolutely loved it. Can<br />not  wait for Engimatis 2 to come out.  The mystery was fantastic.
B007MU85D0|5.0|It's a good album.  I enjoy all the songs on here. It's an album where if you are looking to mellow out, or just drive a long distant (even if it is short), it is a good to listen to.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book - it has all the right stuff to keep you reading and entertained and hoping it will go on some more even when you know it has to end
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've only been playing for a little while, but I love this game!  The music is soft and soothing and doesn't detract you from the play.  I like games that make me use my brain.  Too many games out there are too mindless.  I have to stop and think before I make a move.  I could spend way too much time on this!  Graphics are nice, not too loud or bright.  Just soothing.  Probably will get the others in this series when I'm done with this one.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|this movie was so disappointing and i blame it all on the book! The book was such a better story than the movie was. The movie was a pretty typical zombie story. Nothing particularly significant or interesting. The book on the other hand was so interesting and well written. The book didn't have to rely on gore and typical zombie imagery to bring the story across. This was just a big ol zombie movie. BORING. I might of liked this more if I hadn't read the book but I believe watching this movie would of made me not want to read the book. So glad I read the book. Giving this an extra star because I do really think that Brad is a good actor. I always like him, even in this. I just couldnt get past how much this movie was not the book.<br />Biggest issues I had were how fast the zombies could move, and how they made it over the wall in Israel.. my assumption on these is fast zombies are scarier (yet somehow in the book the slow zombies were scary enough) and the movie had to make America be the ones who figured the zombies out.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and loved it. I pre-ordered it as soon as it was available. I'm glad that I did. The DVD worked well and the case was in perfect condition.
1439102813|5.0|This story was written with such insight and empathy that it blew me away.  Everyone should read this book because chances are your life will be touched by this disease at some time now or in the future.  My understanding of Alzeimers's disease was broadened in a way that no technical or medical description has ever offered.  This is an absolute must-read for all who have aging parents, or who plan on growing older themselves.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Good album. I enjoy it.  One or two songs didn't tickle my fancy, but that's okay.  It was still a really good album.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Top mob show in awhile.  Steve does a great job at the helm and the writing is better than the usual mob show.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|So much fun to play when I have time to waste during the day! Must play game for any age.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Have loved this movie since i was a little girl. Love that I have a digital copy that I can watch whenever I want to sing along. Wonderful, wonderful movie.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of my favorite TV shows. I love having them on DVD so I can watch it whenever I feel like it! I also love all the extras that they include on the DVDs. It's neat having a look behind the scenes of The Big Bang Theory. The DVDs all worked and the packaging was all in good condition. Very satisfied and happy to have this in my collection.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|sure you have to wait for the energy to fill up but other than that this game is interesting and pretty neat. there is always something to do which is a bonus because this way the game will not end so fast.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|I  have chosen to delete my review because I do not engage in distateful responses. when I made the review I did not want to write anything, but you are forced to. I am informed on DREDD. Hence the statement. \\"...original movie plot...\\" remark. Just like some did not care for the new \\"Ghost Rider\\"...<br />I believe reviews should be strictly opinion orientated. They are not meant to insult people. A better response should  have been...'this DREDD was based upon its origination, unlike the Stallone film'. Although, if my original response had been comprehended correctly, there shouldn't have been one at all; except to disagree or concur.
B00CQZ65SI|5.0|The book is brilliant.  I cam across it while looking for a gluten free dairy free cookbook.  I know nothing about tennis.  I have been gluten free for over 3 years and dairy free going on one.  I was still having issues with horrible mood swings and what the author terms Sugar Hangovers.  I agree they physically hurt.  i also had a really bad case of the skin disease that goes along with Celiac Disease.  This book over a one week period has improved every aspect of my life.<br /><br />It is a brillant book because it looks at food a little bit differently than any other book I've read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is really just the right degree of challenge - not so easy that it's boring or so difficult that it's frustrating. It's in the Goldilocks zone. Just right.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Enjoyed the no commercial TV!! :) Works for me. Keep it coming, AMAZON! Also like that it's available in both HD and Standard
B007CKIL3O|5.0|Gilbert takes the reader that extra step as she examines actual beliefs about marriage and its effect on loving relationships. She relates her study to her own situation, of course, but allows plenty of mental white space for the reader to insert his/her personal story and bounce it off the history in the book. I'll go back to this book over and over again.
B00B97SNJI|3.0|I was really anticipating the release of this album. The first 2 albums showed growth and promise. This 3rd release finds the band a little stagnant in my opinion. Soundwise, it could be part 2 of their last release. I was hoping to hear a wider range of instruments and sounds here. The songs are for the most part enjoyable, but are not too dissimilar from their previous output. Dawes impressed me in a live setting, however this is a little too studio sterile for my tastes. I have not replayed the disc as much as i usually do for these reasons, but i do intend to give it a few more spins. This will not prevent me from checking out the next release from this up and coming band.  Mark B.Smith
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Since &#34;Drive&#34; im a fan of gosling so I was goin to view regardless, lots of talent in this movie, I liked but would still just go with a rental
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its really fun! I love it! too bad the costumes cost too much... but its easy to play and its FUN!<br /><br />  -Doodle
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Fantastic game for free. Gear concept is fantastic. levels are well mapped out and art is really good. I've been thoroughly impressed for the 4+ hours I've spent on it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a great game, my 7 year old daughter made it through all the levels in just a few hours of playing it
0143038419|5.0|How could anyone resist a worldwide search for a ladder out of a pit of despair? And when it's stuffed with thoughtful humor, it's a book I've given to friends over and over.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Agree with other reviewers - good quality game, nice graphics and sound. Enjoyable storyline that doesn't delay gameplay or get in the way.<br /><br />Would have given 5 stars if developer added...<br /><br />1) volume memory (game reverts to full volume every time you reopen it.) That is very annoying!<br /><br />2) more levels, more difficulty. Took me less than a day to finish, in between other things.<br /><br />3) ability to replay completed levels for improved score. (of course, I understand that it wouldn't fit with the theme... You're ascending a mountain; one can hardly hop back and forth between altitudes.)
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Not an epic failure but.. is a bit contrived at times and drawn out. The villans are great and do deliver its just too bad that its riding on the success of the previous iromman's . Rent don't buy
B00E5C3AJM|4.0|Hey I really loved this game when I first got it you should get this really fast because it seems like you are actually in the game
B008D30K7E|5.0|This is a laugh out loud wonderful book, I haven't read such a great read in a long time.<br />Allan is perfect, I wish I had a grandfather like him. We all need Allan in our lives!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Excited to see the original crew in new adventures!  The alternate universe storyline is a great idea with unlimited possibilities!!
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|Boring Boring Boring....Not up to snuff! Looks like Davie did it just for the money!!!  Only the money.....no way he can be proud of that shiggity!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|have the books since many years...like them a lot,don't you?<br /><br />ALL THE BEST TO YOU ALL  REREAD THE IF YOU CAN
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great story line somewhat gritty, had the alpha male presence throughout, McConaughey  rules, would give a buy status but I rented so im good, if I catch it cheap at walmart may add to collection
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and would have liked to have read more.  The story of James and Bob was heart warming and endearing.  I would like to read more about their life together.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|It is so different to other match 3 games. It really gets me going, I cannot put it down once I have started. No idea how long it will take me to finish as there are so many twists and turns.
0517548232|5.0|The book deals with the basic items of controversy between the libertarian ant the Keynesian school of economics.It strongly supports the former with convincing arguments.Nevertheless it is not a dogmatic libertarian peace of work as it admits the problems of capitalistic progress.Personally i feel impressed of the quality of arguments and the clarity of the conclusions.Overall it is a magnificent book,strongly recommended!
B00000DHRX|1.0|the CD was scratched and the entire third side does not play --  it just skips and stops.<br />So much for dealing with that deadbeat salesperson!<br />Horrible.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Tarantino and his superb cast have outdone themselves. Riveting snd provocative story lines,  great cinematography, outstanding acting and terrific musical score make this a must see.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Well done, enjoyed the final days accounts and activities of our great president who really had a clue during his time
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|I like backgammon and it's fun to play against the computer because you are trying to outwit it.  I haven't played it enough yet to give a thorough review.
B00E66QPCG|4.0|Markus introduces the concept of range bars which have opened my eyes to a number if new perspectives on thrmarkets. He trades a lot of futures and I'm an IRA trader - but you can still apply the principles to stocksand indice options where I like to play<br /><br />I'm going to give this a serious attempt<br /><br />I recommend the book<br /><br />Bill Lasko
B000IAZ5HK|5.0|Okay, I haven't tried every salad dressing dispenser in the world. But this is the best I've ever used, by a long shot. It's also gorgeous!<br /><br />The rubber plug assembly has two stoppers--one at the bottom to keep the contents airtight and another at the top to stop the metal tube used to dispense the dressing. When the inner part is removed, you have a tiny carafe--fairly wide-mouthed--like a mini wine carafe.<br /><br />To make your dressing, you just remove the inner part and pour the ingredients in. Then put the inner part back in and shake. When you're ready to serve, take off the top rubber stopper and you have a gorgeous metal tube to dispense the dressing.<br /><br />This is a huge improvement over others I've used which have narrow necks so I had to mix in a bowl with a whisk and then pour into the recipient with a funnel. The rubber stopper also is much easier to use and clean that cork dispensers on others I've used. And I love the two-cork design. You can shake vigorously and nothing leaks.<br /><br />I also love that it's glass. I don't enjoy eating from plastic, even though I'm sure the better brands are bpa free.<br /><br />I like this so much I am immediately buying another one. It will serve for times I have two kinds of dressing to serve.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Very good, did not insult my politics. By showing that extremism knows no party side. And had a lot of action.
B002C4PWD2|3.0|Great acting and cinematography couldn't overcome the superficiality of the story line. Could have been much more thought provoking and less predictable. Disappointing.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Complex yet gratifying, D-E-F-I-N-I-T-E-L-Y had matrix undertones, but it worked. The human species will survive!! Rent it don't buy, or not
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|Wonderful entertainment combo package for the grandchildren!! &#34;Children&#34; of all ages will be entertained by the classid story of Peter Pan!
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Works well and I've been using the free version for years. I'm using the paid version now. Just a few more bells and whistles.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|&#34;Silverado&#34; is full of western action, clever dialogues and a powerful storyline that will never grow old!  The list of stars, including Kevin Costner, Kevin Kline, Scott Glen, Danny Glover and Jeff Goldblum is sure to please a wide spectrum of Hollywood buffs!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Not bad but can run into money pretty quickly.  And the competition set up doesn't really let you see it because you have to focus on the icons.  Ok for free I guess but not sure I would pay for it.  Nice graphics and sounds though.  I'll have to play with it a bit more to really know.
1476729085|5.0|The book was absolutely delightful. I didn't want to put it down once I started reading. The author has done an outstanding job creating realistic likeable characters, or in one case, a true scuzzball. All of the main characters grow and develop over the course of the story as they learn from their experiences. I found myself rooting for Don, the main character, and Rosie each step of their journey to find a wife for Don and Rosie's biological father. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a book with endearing but also complex characters and a story that is inspiring without being sappy.<br /><br />Don is a professor of genetics at a university. He is also definitely on the autism spectrum although he does not seem to realize that he is. He wants to find a wife but the problem is he has never even been on a date. So in his usual methodical manner he decides to create the Wife Project, a sixteen-page questionnaire designed to find his perfect partner. It does not go over well with the women he meets. Another professor at the university, one of his two friends, takes a look at the questionnaire and its results suggests that he send Don a candidate. He sends Rosie to meet Don. Rosie is one her own quest to find her biological father and needs help from a geneticist. Don decides very quickly that Rosie is not a potential wife but he offers it help her try to find her father. The two of them embark on a whirlwind adventure of discovery mostly about who they really are and how you can't decide ahead of time who you will fall in love with.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this book as part of a Goodreads giveaway on the premise that I would review it.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Funny funny funny, buy, rent watch enjoy, Amazom requires a written review so im spewing words out here, Funny enjoy!!
B0001FYPZU|5.0|Really enjoy this movie......love seeing the old fashioned houses and clothing.  It is a very heartwarming story based on a real life situation in St. Louis, Mo.  I especially liked the DVD explaining the making of the film and the information about the actors and actresses in the movie.  Would highly recommend it!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Best of all, no major violence or bad language.<br /><br />Great plot with a surprise ending.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun and never boring! There is always something to do! The only down side is there is no way to earn &quot;bucks&quot; unless you spend cash for them! I recommend this game to anyone...very fun!! I need friends...add me...devinsmommmy!!!
B005NFJAT4|5.0|Excellent dialogue, character development and action. Great portrayal of leadership and the challenge if motivating men in the darkest if battles
0062082353|5.0|This is a great book. This will be a classic for anybody who is or wants to know about what it was like in the sandbox and what it was like to be a deployed sniper. Helps you understand some of the stresses some of our soldiers go through and what it's like after then come home and the obstacles they face with their families and their personal demons.<br /><br />I should have gotten it signed at SHOT Show last yr. I am at such a loss for his needless death.<br /><br />Rest in Peace CPO Kyle and Your friend Chad Littlefield.
B005PMNBNG|4.0|I didn't realize i was missing a long, moody album till i watched the 3 part video series released with this album.  That is a great intro - but the album just takes it to another level.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|This is a very powerful film depicting Liberace's lifestyle that was hidden from public view for so many years.  Michael Douglas and Matt Damon both demonstrate their extraordinary acting skills to show the public a glimpse of what really went on behind the candelabra. If you view it with an open mind it is a very interesting and powerful film, but not one that EVERYONE would enjoy.
B0081X8AE6|1.0|i love this music....good quality recording.  cant say more except it is what i had hoped for.  good stuff..  period.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I wasn't sure whether to give this app three or four stars. I gave it four because it is a very fun app, challenging as the game goes on, and actually not a waste of time. However, this app does have some issues. For one, on the &quot;Stop the Blood&quot; level, you can only put your fingers over two holes, but no more. Also, when I first got this app, I was unsure of what to do with the &quot;Blow to Keep the Plane Flying&quot; level, as my Kindle Fire does not have a microphone. Finally, I found the setting to turn off the Plane level. But overall, Dumb Ways to Die is an entertaining and fun game.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|love the harry potter series. This movie was just a reason to extend the movie showing for another movie. This movie is total filler for the series.
B000QGEB12|5.0|This movie is funny as hell, it definitely isn't for everybody though. If you like classic Kung fu movies and the wonders that they do, you should like this just fine.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun app. Had to re-enter a new review as my Kindle crashed and I had to reset and reload the app.
0684857219|5.0|Ok this book is phenomenal.  A must have.  For the price you cant beat it and a wealth full of information.  So informative. Cant say enough.
B005FUTC86|5.0|An a amazing movie that I just love that it was cheap and still the same story now my boys can watch a child movie I had and loved thank u
B00F35BV64|5.0|Just fun. Referential to previous films. Might even be better than the originals. See if you can predict the next episodes.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I don't get this game, but my kids put a parental lock on my informative murder porn and I need to figure out how to tame a horse to unlock the parental lock.  I keep trying, but kids keep kicking me out the game and calling me a griefer.  This is going to ruin my marriage if I can't figure it out.
B00633W614|5.0|This was a great read, I also read the other two in the series. wish there were more than three to the series.
1609611543|4.0|Lots of knowledge to be learned here and If you think the author is just crunching all the data and spinning it to fit his book, then you're wrong. Lots of other books have came out about this subject. Just try to keep carbs low and stay away from anything Monsanto touches, cause it may kill you or at least shorten your life expectancy.
0316096199|5.0|Lucky is a book that is very descriptive and shocking but none the less a good read. Sometimes Lucky makes you angry but well worth the emotional rollercoaster.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love to play this game with friends<br />. you can laugh at them and just have fun.I hope you enjoy ti's game!!
193355021X|5.0|Common sense approach and to build a nation start going back to the board. The author is a scholar in his approach.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the story it's so romantic make you thing twice about your love life sex life as well love it
B00915G6MG|4.0|Overall, the tenth season was enjoyable and flowed well. It wrapped up the death of Ziva's father and Director Vance's wife fairly well. The only reason I give it four rather than five stars is that the final couple of episodes were borderline unbelievable. The witch hunt with an ever changing target, which ultimately settles on Gibbs for no apparent reason just seemed to be a reach. Then the \\"send Gibbs away on a mysterious secret mission\\" to have some kind of cliff hanger was a questionable ending to an otherwise great show. Keep up the good work guys. I'll be sorry to see Ziva leave next season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, love trying to collect the bananas but just seem to keep hitting cars and buses and electrical wires. This is a super cool game. Downloads do take some time on Kinder but well worth the wait. There also seems to be a little lag time when the game goes to letting you ride Gru&#34;s rocket or the Fluffy Unicorn....but not complaining it was fun! Graphics are super and if skilled enough (which I'm not) it isn't) buying bananas and Gru Tokens isn't necessary. But not giving up...I'll just keep running...just keep running...ooops hit a truck.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I preorder this book on my ipad, as I've read the other books in the crossfire novels...but for some reason it wouldn't download says pause across the book sooo I just got a new Kindle and down loaded it with no problems...so now I've paid for this book twice. tried writing to ipad/iTunes with no response also wrote/emailed the author/no response, so i'm glad that it appeared on my kindle. Have another book that I preordered and its also on pause....has anyone else have this problem?
B00F91SCXC|3.0|There was good action, but they could have done more with it. I would recommend it to rent when you don't feel like paying attention too much. Not much thinking required.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Worked well, great price. Did not last as long as the Energizers, but they were less than half the price and lasted at least 50% as long. I decided to move up to the Energizers for certain applications like the Dog's training collar, which requries alot of energy to produce the loud beep, but for other applications like the garage door opener and travel alarms, these batteries work great
B0097EWK3A|5.0|IT WAS FRUSTRATING AT TIMES. FRIGHTENING OCCASIONALLY.  BUT IT WAS THE BEST PUZZLE I HAVE EVER DONE. I CAN't wait till the next one comes out.
0738711500|5.0|Excellent book and cards.  Very easy to follow.  Simple steps and lots of positive encouragement.  Lots of fun learning to read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's an amusing way to waste a  couple of hours. It also doesn't make one wait hours to do a simple task which is a plus.
B0063IH60K|4.0|purchased solitaire cause I played it on my ipad...now I have it on my new kindle. the game helps me wine down for the day.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|So many people are crying about the ending because things didn't turn out the way they wanted them too.<br />There were some flaws in Season 8, such as Hannah not even disguising herself in public with a wig or something.<br />But overall the ending was brilliant. - I'm not giving away anything here but in my opinion the only way this series could end was with Dexter somehow getting killed. Well that which happened was even worse (for them) and there were no winners at the end.  This was not a movie with a hero who saves the world and lives happily ever after.  This was a very long series that includes approx 134 people who died of which about half were from Dexter.  Did anyone really think there was going to be a bunch of happy endings thru all this?<br />The ending was even better than I could have imagined.  My hats off to the writers and to all you crybaby's - WAH.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first out all those years ago and it still affects me.  It is interesting from a historical viewpoint.  More than that it is interesting from a humane viewpoint - emotional.  I loved the score - it works seamlessly with the story.  The sad point is I do not believe we have learned from history and events similar to these continue today in all parts of the world including ours.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I've always loved the brilliant yet mysterious Sherlock Holmes and I can't get enough of his  stories . This is just another example of the brilliance of an outstanding authors dedication to his readers .
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Super cute and fun to play! I think I enjoy playing even more than my daughter! One thing I don't like is that many of the items in the game must be purchased with acorns which are not easy to get. They do offer packs of them that you can purchase with a credit card, of course. I realize this is how they make their money but it is still pretty lame.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|kind of a pain to set up... and the description on amazon as well as the google website for the product is vague.  this is a device that is a transmitter only.  it does not get on the internet itself i.e., you cannot get to the web through this alone... only if you are &#34;casting&#34; from a computer... so basically you have to be running a computer while you run this... and this cannot control the computer.  basically a glorified &#34;projector&#34; to get stuff from a computer to display on a TV.  disappointed.  does far less than anticipated, and i actively looked for info on it.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I use this all the time! It can be used for small easy jobs, or large calculus problems. I recommend it highly.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It was a very interesting book. I loved the first book matched. It was a little boring from time to time, but then it started getting really exciting. I think ally condie is a very good author. I can't wait to read your next book.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|Amazing not only the music great. But tjese guys are the best. However, they just raised prices by almost double. Still first rate.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|love this app! my favorite. I have this on my apple products as well as android products. I highly recommend this as a relaxation aid and sleep aid, especially if you do a lot of traveling.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. Action packed and star studded. I love Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. If you are wanting to be entertained and have a great thrill I recommend this movie. My kids (13 and 17) both loved it as well. I can't say that I follow all of the Marvel Universe movies but this one was amazing. I am looking forward to the second one.<br /><br />- Charlotte Oliver Clearwater FL
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was so hard to find out there was a game all about ponies .<br />I love this game hoof bump to the creator of the game.<br /><br />from:rainbow dash

B0012QRPU4|5.0|You haven't lived until you watched this show! So buy it now and also it is time to cook Jesse
B00932A4XE|4.0|I recommend this to anyone becoming new parents (or new parents again).  It was funny for both guys and girls.  Shows the male side of pregnancy/fatherhood as well, which was great.  Good movie!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Expected more than this. I really don't understand how this book got so many stars and people that read it!
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|I bought this for the sole purpose of watching another 3D movie.  We hadn't seen it at the theaters and didn't hear much hype about it.  So, I went looking for a new 3D movie for the whole family and decided to give this a go.<br /><br />All in the movie was good.  Not really great, but it kept me entertained.  The most amazing part of the whole movie for us was when they climb the treetops and blow out the fire and the night sky lights.  Everyone in my family went \\"oooohhhhhh\\"  at the same time :)<br /><br />3D makes all the difference.
B004I744AS|5.0|For me, this application was just what I needed. It works just like on the website, has definitions that make sense, and offers other definitions if some don't make sense. It acts like a person, only inside the computer! ;)
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love how the series continues. At the beginning of the book there is tons of action, and later on the story unfolds more, and more twists appear. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This I s one of the best books I have read in a long time. It's ashamed that he was killed
B002NZK5RI|5.0|I ordered this movie off of amazon because it was reasonably priced. When it was delivered and I opened the package the whole case was completely soaked with some oil type fluid so I immediately jumped onto the amazon app and filed the replacement request. Amazon shipped out a new copy that day and UPS even came to the house with the return label printed and an envelope all set to return the damaged item. Amazon rocks.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am a little late to the party but I am so glad to be a fan of this series!  Love the time period and it makes me miss my grandfather in a way since he was a young man during this period.  I am devastated at the loss of Matthew but hopeful that Season 4 will help me cope!
B000JVSUS4|5.0|I am very pleased with this movie.. It showed up within the time frame. I had originally bought the same movie from a different store...and it never even played in the bluray or on my computer...I will not be returning to that store again. I think I will stick to amazon for all of my movie purchases. :)

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Completely hooked.  Enjoyed it thoroughly but am afraid I look for conspiracy theories as a result of watching it!  Joking! Can't wait to watch Season 3.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|9.99 if your 4 year old clicks on the wrong item. Great, thanks Amazon and you can't return it and I don't even know what it is?

B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is super fun. I play it daily. I would probably have been willing to pay for this one.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who saw it in the movies.  She absolutely loves this movie so it was well worth it!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I'm hooked with the first episode.  I don't know how on earth they will makes additional seasons but can't wait to find out what happens next.
B00915G6SU|4.0|the only problem that I have with the disc is that it is not closed caption. I am not a fan of sdh. that is really the only problem I have with  it.
B0025KVLRY|3.0|The songs didn't sound good. They didn't sound like the Beatles. I realized I already had this CD, so will keep both. I like the photos though.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What a great story teller. A well written book to me is one that you just can't seem to put down as you want to know more...this is one of those books. Sorry it is over.
B007PVHANM|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST ACCURATE DOCUMENTARY OF BOB I'VE SEEN. THE SCENES IN AND AROUND KINGSTON (AT THE NATIONAL STADIUM AND OLD HOPE ROAD FOR EXAMPLE) BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF THAT ERA AND MY OLD STOMPING GROUNDS.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Watching this series makes me feel like I came upon an accident!  I hate a lot of it but can't quit watching.  Watching this and then watching the nightly news makes me feel very cynical about our government.  I realize that the series is over the top but then I wonder.....maybe not!  Looking forward to more!
B00ALGW286|5.0|Great books, great movies, great stories draw us into a world in which we are not familiar and we close the last page of the book, leave the cinema or story teller with a feeling that we have been a guest in that other place. This was the feeling I had as I accompanied 14 year old Marina on a journey through  her Moscow childhood at the time of that tectonic plate shifting change from the broken world of Soviet communism to the openness of Perestroika and the optimistic, if fragile promise of democracy.<br /><br />What Julia Gousseva achieves in \\"Moscow Dreams\\" is to get deep inside the head of Marina and show us this world in flux through a young woman's eyes - the appearance of McDonald's, that icon of Americana in the streets of Moscow, her first visit with her friend Nadia overshadowed by an attempted coup, tanks rolling down the streets in a scene that harks back to a dark past, the illusion of freedom immediately shattered.<br /><br />Marina is real, you can picture her clearly in your mind, but she is also a metaphor, an allegory, her own mood shifts and changes - physically, intellectually, psychologically, mirroring the changes in Russia itself, changes that, in the girl as well as the country, would never be reversed. Ms Gousseva clearly knows her subject and I enjoyed the small, intimate details that pepper the pages like an exotic spice and allowed me to get under Marina's skin.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I'm so glad that this app finally came out on kindle fire. I love it! The only negative thing I have to say is that when you have to blow the flying guy, it doesn't work and you lose a life.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Well I agree with the majority and say that the fact that you are constantly having to purchase diamonds with real money or waiting g for what seems like an excruciatingly long time to reenergise spoils what would b a fantastic game also the constant get friends and join Facebook spoilt it for me.the graphics are good and if you turn the sound/music off its better all in all I'm glad I never paid for this game or would defiantly be feeling let down but if you have infinite time and or resources you will love it
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Not a typical big budget movie which would elicit lots of eye rolls and bored glances around the room.  When the action happens its coherent. Transformers.... this is not!<br /><br />This could have been made on 1/2 the budget without losing a bit of enjoyability and then they would have double+ their $$$.<br /><br />Have now read into the third Mars book and am enjoying it a lot.  If nothing else, glad this movie introduced me to a new book series.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I will be ordering Season 3 tonight.  Love the fashion and the characters.  Highly recommend this series for period drama lovers!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book after seeing a bunch of reviews on it. At first it quickly grabbed my attention, but then as I reached the middle it threw me for a loop. It was all in all a good read and looking forward to reading more from this author.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh John Green you have amazed me yet again. Not once with Looking For Alaska but now twice with The Fault In Our Stars! I connected with theses characters on a deeper level. More than any character I've ever connected with in a story. I felt I followed them every where. That the were my friends in a nonfictional setting. I know these characters aren't of existence but my oh my do I wish they were. Hazel and Augustus's love is on a deeper level than I'm sure one would have been in the real world but it was still a magical feeling watching young \\"cancer survivors\\" fall head over heels in love with each other. I could not imagine the end of this book and when it came I felt a whole sadness wash over me like life just ended and for some it has...hint hint. Oh John Green write me more!

B000FC10MU|4.0|Everything changes. Nothing stays the same. What was popular and what we worshiped before is nowhere to be seen now. It's the world of lost toys, or in this case, lost gods. Read it. It's worth your time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is my 1st time in the app world. guess that's called a noob but I like this calculator. its not to fancy for my 7yr old but with just a swipe of the finger its got that lil bit extra the average noob needs.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|With so many people talking about it, I was expecting the moon I guess. The plot is boring as hell. The only interesting parts are the one's it's famous for. Can't call it a novel, more a white paper on sex with other parts used to simply fill up pages.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Superhero fantasy doesn't seem to have a lot of serious entries, which is a niche this story fills nicely. Very straightforward and enjoyable.

B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|This was a very well put together movie with just enough of all the right elements, strong acting, very nice CGI, good stunts, explosions & high production value.

B00F35BV64|2.0|I so wanted to like this movie, I really did.  I enjoyed the previous movie showing the young Kirk and crew.  But this was disappointing.  I'm not a Trekkie purist protecting Star Trek canon, but I saw no real purpose in messing with the previous story lines.  The premise from the previous &#34;young Kirk&#34; movie was that the sequence of time was violated--which opens the door for huge leaps of creative license.  Still looking for the creative, though.  Nothing original, just pieces of the original series and movies thrown together and then pureed.<br /><br />(Spoiler alert)<br /><br />FX:  lots of things blowing up and running gun fights, so if you like pyrotechnics, there's plenty for you.<br /><br />Khan:  Yes, he's back--again!  So in this movie, long before the original series crew finds Richardo Montalban and his crew floating through space in &#34;Space Seed,&#34; Admiral Marcus found them first and used Khan to build Weapons of mass destruction.  Classically-trained Cumberbatch (young Sherlock Holmes) doesn't play the role with the passion Montalban did.  He's the brooding intellectual for the most part except when he squeezes peoples' heads, then he looks quite maniacal.  In the end, Khan is put back into cryogenic suspension along with his crew (which were never seen in this movie). But you can be sure we'll see Khan back again and again.<br /><br />Klingons:  After violating the Prime Directive, Kirk is now seen as a irresponsible maverick blindly violating rules; thus the perfect patsy to deliver the WMD's to Chronos and spark a war with the Klingons.  Yet, they are only a cameo at the beginning of the movie and not seen again despite the fact that Star fleet has violated the neutral zone resulting in the killing of a Klingon squad.<br /><br />Tribbles:  In another juxtaposition with the Original series, Dr. McCoy already has a tribble long before they supposedly first encounter them in &#34;the Trouble with Tribbles.&#34;  No explanation of why tribbles are now in the past.  No real reason for their inclusion other than to be a petrie dish for Khan's blood.<br /><br />Christopher Pike:  The pilot for the original series had Capt. Pike as the lead, but it didn't sell.  When the series was revamped with Kirk in the lead, they recycled the pilot film into &#34;The Menagerie.&#34;  Pike, who was badly mutilated and wheelchair bound, finds life again as a young man in the illusionary world of Talos IV.  Now let's erase that Spock was First Officer to Pike for 11 years aboard the Enterprise and that Kirk was introduced to Pike for the fist time in that episode.  So, ok, Pike is now Kirk's surrogate father figure and the one that convinced him to join Star Fleet.  Fine.  But in this movie, Pike is killed off right at the beginning.  Why?  To utilize the timeworn vehicle of a slain loved one as Kirk's motivation for anger and revenge.<br /><br />Carol Marcus:  In &#34;Wrath of Khan,&#34; this was Kirk's past flame and mother of his son.  This movie inserts the character into Kirk's youth before they become lovers and before he does whatever he does that caused she and the son to hate him.  The sparks between the two provided a promising subtext to the movie.  Except that she's a weapons expert in this one and becomes a terraform expert later--probably goes back to school for another doctorate.<br /><br />Kirk:  Last, but not least.  The previous movie asked you to swallow that Kirk as a cadet fresh from the academy is made captain of the Enterprise.  Fine, it was an emergency, no one else could do it, field promotion in wartime and all that.  Suspend judgement because this movie establishes the captaincy as permanent, eliminating all those pesky years of earning his way up the ranks and all the references in the previous series and movies alluding to those past lessons learned.  Here's the difference--Kirk as a seasoned captain could pull off those seat-of-the-pants escapades because he had a command presence and seemed to know what he was doing.  In this movie, Kirk is just brash and willful with no substance to back it up.  Therefore, the underlying storyline is Kirk's maturation process which Spock aids him in.  Loss, death, self-sacrifice, fear, humility; Kirk has a lot to learn.<br /><br />In a replay of the touching scene at the end of &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; where Spock dies from radiation with Kirk on the other side of the glass, the two are juxtaposed and Kirk dies from radiation and self-sacifice.  Yes, KIRK DIES.  Too bad they didn't end it there.  McCoy, transfuses Khan's miraculous blood into Kirk's fresh corpse and he lives yet again.<br /><br />Rent the movie, it's worth a couple bucks.  But it helps if you know very little about Star Trek--or anything else for that matter!

B007Q476KU|5.0|With all due respect to Spielberg, the story of War Horse existed long before the movie.  The film is an adaptation of a children's story written by Michael Morpurgo over 30 years ago.  It was inspired by the depictions and anecdotes from those who experienced the Great War, including a painting of horses charging through barbed wire.<br /><br />Real events:  The backdrop of the story depicts the real conditions of warfare.  Millions of horses were slaughtered on both sides of the conflict.  At the dawn of the 20th century, it was the first clash between the old battle tactics with charging cavalry and the new mechanized world of tanks, machine guns and artillery.  Much of the war was a 4-year long stalemate with soldiers a few hundred yards from each other in filthy trenches, separated by barricades of barbed wire and pelting poisonous gas at each other.  I wonder how many people know that the term &#34;No Man's Land&#34; originated then, or why Nov 11th is a holiday.<br /><br />Story:  The book tells the story of war and cruelty vs love and humanity through the eyes of the horse.  As a children's book, the message is direct and inspiring.  It doesn't explore the trivial politics that started the war and the  meaninglessness of the devastating waste of life that followed.  It speaks to the ageless human need to connect and to find hope in the midst of hopelessness.  That's why dogs are universally therapeutic in children's hospitals, prisons and old-age homes.  The story is captivating on it's own.  I first saw it in its Broadway play adaptation.  The Handspring Puppets stopped being contraptions of steel and wood manipulated by visible humans and quickly became as real and engaging as any true-life horse.  I wanted to see the story again, which brings me to the movie.<br /><br />Movie:  The story is worth 5 stars and at least 4 hankies on its own.  The rating above is for this adaptation of the story.  It is a worthy telling of the story of War Horse.<br /><br />1). Cinematography:  Very good, the filming was done on location in Britain and adds immeasurably to the scenes.  There are a number of wide panoramic shots of the beautiful countryside.  The war scenes are grimly realistic from the mud and rats in the trenches to the mounds of spent and mutilated horses.  The scenes of Joey galloping panic-stricken through the battlefield to be thoroughly entangled in barbed wire was heart-wrenching.  In fact it was so real, I wondered how they did it under the watch of SPCA advocates.<br /><br />2). Horses:  Excellent:  They picked a pair of beautiful horses to be Joey and Topthorn.  You can definitely see the cause for heartache of the German wrangler to be ordered to turn them into draft horses.  The scene of the horses pulling the heavy artillery gun to the top of the ridge was worth a hankie by itself.  Often times you can see the cues and staging of animal actors.  The training and handling of these horses told the story seamlessly.<br /><br />3). Casting:  Good:  Actors probably want to stand out for their performances.  For me, I think a performance is best when the actor becomes the character and doesn't stand out.  I like how Jeremy Irvine was able to subtly show the boy at the beginning and the growth to manhood by the end.  I especially liked Peter Mullan as his father.  It was a much better depiction than in the play, although in the play the father stayed home from the Boer War.  It helps to have the mother explain about Albert's father's past in the war and adding the regimental pennant as a thread through the storyline.  But I thought Mullan gave depth to the character and to the family's plight.  Otherwise the father is just a mean old drunk that sells the boy's horse without telling him.<br /><br />This movie is a great depiction of an excellent story that is worth seeing, and seeing many times.  My only warning is to stock up on hankies.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you're reading or will be reading &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;, I promise you, Mr. King is at the top of his game. I found these two brief paragraphs to be full of incredible, raw, moving emotion (in context, no spoilers). How someone can write of such boogada-boogada ghostie things but stay so beautifully grounded in the core of humanity is astonishing and wonderful.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I had a couple of issues with the movie being a little to much like WoK in certain areas, but overall, a good and enjoyable movie.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I like the star system to keep me challenged with a game. Keeps the mind alert with a variety of easy-to-read graphics, but still requires concentration to determine which tiles are available.

1451668945|4.0|I like Mary Higgins Clark.  I think I have read all her mysteries, and I always look forward to a new one.  I thought her previous book The Lost Years was a bit below par for her, but I liked Daddy's Gone A Hunting.  It involves several different plot lines--an explosion at a furniture factory that left one man dead and the owner's daughter in a coma, the murder of a student two years earlier, the disappearance of a would-be actress twenty-eight years earlier, a boating accident that killed six people the same year as the disappearance, and the activities of a homeless man who abandoned his family forty years earlier.  It is obvious that somehow all these plot lines will be tied together, but the author keeps you wondering how that will happen.  She holds your attention to the end when you do see the connection between these diverse people and events.  Some of the ending was a bit too neat--there was one secret that I don't think could have gone undetected or unrevealed for almost thirty years--but I still found the story enjoyable.  I am recommending it to my friends and I would recommend it to all fans of Mary Higgins Clark.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the first book , but the second I found boring in spots. I read the first book in a day, it took 4 days to finally finish it. I hope book 3 is better. Overall I would recommend this series.
B008Y212PI|3.0|This logic puzzle game is a fun way to while away some time. It's easy to learn and a decent challenge with the larger grids. My only complaint is the pictures that get added as you solve the puzzles leave a lot to be desired, but I guess it's cheaper for the developer to use stock photos than to hire illustrators. I laughed to see the underwater scene includes 3 goldfish!
B000NTHT6G|4.0|Loved the concept of this movie  - that the Will Farrell character is a character in a novel that the character which Emma Thompson, who plays a novelist, is writing.  This is one of those quirky, artistic films that carries off neatly an unbelievable premise.  It is fun.  Wish Emma Thompson would play more roles like the novelist in this one.  I liked this movie, and can understand why some absolutely love it.
B00DL2W7Q4|5.0|One of the problems with constantly questioning established views, and thinking outside the box, is that things start getting a bit meta. People start thinking back in the box, because they are thinking 'outside' outside the box, or start thinking so far from the box, its no longer visible or recognised.<br /><br />If the previous paragraph is at all understandable, these were my thoughts while beginning David and Goliath. Gladwell seemed to be so determined to squeeze so much out of the box thinking into one coherent piece, that his semi-metaphorical David and Goliath covered using deception ethically, rethinking crime and punishment, and growing up with adversity. I was especially confused by the significance of Goliath apparently having a defunct pituitary gland and David being hella more sneaky than your typical shepard.<br /><br />Despite struggling to dismantle Gladwell's analogy, the stories and explanations teamed with Gladwell's typical brilliance. The lessons are as important and insightful as ever and While the third section 'The problems with Power' was perhaps the furthest from his David and Goliath analogy, I found this section the best and contained the most compelling arguments for rethinking military and justice systems.<br /><br />So aside from an unusual theme and his stories going on the most extreme tangents I've read in some time, Gladwell's David and Goliath contains perhaps some of the most convincing rationales for rethinking entrenched ideas across the globe. Read it now.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not put it down.  Kate Morton is a fantastic writer.  I have already recommended this book to my friends who also thought it was great.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a trekkie, so generally anything with Star Trek is going to catch my interest, OK, maybe not some of those stupid Voyager episodes or DS9 episodes, but this is a true Star Trek adventure movie, I know that some would disagree.  But the concept of this new timeline opens the door to endless storylines and the fact that they played off one of the truly great original episodes is no surprise.  While just having a new Star Trek movie brings smiles to my face...I do share some disgust with others who have written reviews about the sets used and also believe that they need to get rid of J.J. Abrahms, I was half expecting to see an Alien from the Alien movies pop up out of the engineering section which resembles a milk processing plant or something on that order.  Please, the Next Generation had better sets and this is a major motion picture.  I understand the timeline is earlier than TNG, but even the TV show Enterprise had sets more inline with Trekkie fare.  I blame Abrahms, it's his show, get rid of him and get someone who is a true trekkie to make the next Star Trek movie.  There are generations of people watching.  Generations who grew up in the era of the US space program, that made young kids dream of who things that could be in the future.  The original Star Trek was a dream that shaped people's viewpoints, explored space but also skated the edge of social or moral sensibilities, we need another Roddenberry.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|If you're looking at this review, you are probably asking yourself what I was asking myself: Do I buy the HP12c or the TIBAII? A finance professor recommended the HP12c to me, then another finance professor insisted on the TIBAII. I purchased both, read 300+ pages of instruction manuals, and here's what happened:<br /><br />For almost every calculation, the HP12c, once you learn to use RPN (contrast with algebraic for you guys who don't know what I'm talking about) is sooooo much more comfortable and, more importantly, much faster. If I want to calculate standard deviation, I can chain the entire equation out without stopping or storing a single value--in other words, I never have to say \\"okay, gotta write this value down (or store it) so I can call it back up later when I need to add it to the next value\\". I did this on a statistics test and I was the first one done. I got worried because everyone else was still working on problems, but guess what? I was the only student using the HP12c, because no one wants to learn a new system--people are intimidated by RPN. Don't be: it's awesome.<br /><br />But on the other hand, the \\"worksheets\\" for the TIBAII are actually quite useful. HP12C doesn't have a default 30/360 setting for bonds (it can be programmed according to the manual in about 40 steps, which I'm still learning about). TIBAII has some conveniences like combination buttons and permutation buttons. But guess why? As I mentioned above, in the HP12c, you can chain those calculations without even thinking, so it doesn't need those buttons. TIBAII, with algebraic notation, benefits greatly from the added functions. So TIBAII appears to provide extra value that, frankly, is unnecessary if you use HP12c.<br /><br />I could give more examples like these. The TIBAII's worksheets allow for fool-proof entry and give a few extra results that are \\"useful\\" [meaning, useful for the TIBAII, but HP12c users are doing them quickly from memory] (discounted payback, multiple IRR,NFV--i have the plus professional-- for example).<br /><br />Who should use the HP12c? Well, from my experience, people who are good with numbers and want a device that keeps up with their computational instincts use the HP12c. As I mentioned before, you can chain together some seriously long computations in cool ways. If you are not that type of guy, it's not going to be that useful for you--the thing is, I would argue that the HP12c can turn you into that kind of guy. The possibilities, once the system is learned, are great.<br /><br />The TIBAII is definitely a \\"safer\\" calculator. It is also more technologically advanced. The worksheets have value. They give you useful outputs (useful for the CFA, yes). But the HP12c user will tell you(rightly) that some of these are crutches that will result in you forgetting how to do the calculations (combinations, permutations).<br /><br />Here's what I've done: I use the HP12c for everything I can, and I use the TIBAII for the 30/360 bond worksheet (and the discounted payback and a few other features that would save time on the CFA).<br /><br />So my goal is to use the fastest always, and to always give priority to me KNOWING a calculation--not blindly relying on a button. HP12c is the overall winner, but the TIBAII has a minor role on my desk.<br /><br />Buying both calculators is really not that big of an expense.<br /><br />One final note: the layout of the HP12c is so much more fluid than TIBAII's lame scientific-calculator look. Every time I pick up the HP12c, I esthetically enjoy it. I have the platinum version, and man does it feel good.<br /><br />Good with math? Need a tool that allows you to exress that? You need HP12c's RPN. Like the safety of support? Like extra features you don't have to know how to calculate yourself? Need the 4-5 things that TIBAII offers quickly (for the CFA, for example?)?: buy the TIBAII. Are you like me? Want the RPN but also need that 30/360 bond worksheet? Use HP12c 95% of the time, then pick up the cheaper-feeling, plastic-y, scientific-y TIBAII (which is, nonetheless, a good product).<br /><br />One final thing: Once you learn RPN, you will be ruined for algebraic. The fact that I say that should tell you a lot. When I use algebraic on the TIBAII, I find myself thinking \\"what idiot would actually prefer this crap over RPN?\\" I know I shouldn't, but I now tend to assume people who are bad at math would naturally avoid RPN and the HP12c. Again, that's a very biased statement, but one that, even acknowledging it's biased, I still say.<br /><br />Okay amigos, let the comments begin.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Awesome! Great history and makes you want to play music. Sad to see the history end but it can live on in this piece.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me holding on till the end. I've read it before but it was still extremely exciting to read it again and again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large buttons, the clearly delineated spaces, and colors of the keys and background.  It is very easy to use.
0007466064|4.0|Not quite as stimulating as previous books, but it continues the story, and let's face it, once you're hooked, you are hooked!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so fun get this app LOVE this app I know you will love it as much as I do<br /><br />Love ,Iove,LOVE this app been paying for an hour
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout writes in an engaging style, on the level, and with some comedic interjection. One can feel the joy in the words of this book. The practical exercises are &#34;doable&#34;, and the book engages one to test the Divine within.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Setting in Australia is interesting and different.  Plot twists keep the interest up and it's not a foregone conclusion how things turn out.  Kept me listening and wanting t read/listen more from this author.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app to play a good time waster as well. It's all good except that most of the stuff cost gems which you have to buy because you can't earn enough gems to get anything other than that it's fine.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The cable worked fine, it's the Kindle Fire that has the problem. This was a replacement for the charger that came with the Kindle.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|My 6 year old son has had it for several weeks and seems to be holding up fine. It has already been through a lot
B0027MJU00|4.0|I choose this book because I read Flynn's other two titles.  Another good mystery with good twists and turns. Dark Places wasn't as disturbing as Sharp Objects and although Gone Girl's plot had more twists, Dark Places had its share.  Overall, another page turner!
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|i hate this game!It is an immature game that will  rot poor childrens brains.Think of the children who play this game that have anger  issues.They're stuck on a level boom! A problem for everyone.
0061148512|4.0|Gripping and intense...and horrifying and weird. Knowing it's a thinly concealed autobiography of the author, whose untimely demise is known, makes it a sad read as well. It's a classic for a reason but left me very unsettled just the same.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I got this app a few days ago, started it playing with it, and it is everything it says it is. I recommend this app, truly worth it.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I love this movie, it has a great message, and very entertaining at the same time and the soundtrack is also very good.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is a waste of time.why in the world would you let your child play a game that has grafity and runs from a cop.That teaches kids to break rules and think its okay to run away instead of facing the consequences.This game is horable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my daughter absolutely loves this game. keeps her entertained for hours and is easy to follow. the minions are great
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I cant believe the author allowed this. Just another hollywood hapy ending video game. Has nothing NOTHING to do with the book. A great book, a mediocre film.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game. I always enjoy playing this game. It provides a different challenge, and I really like it. I recommend this to anyone who likes regular solitair.
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|I don't know how this book was rated as well as it was. The concept is a good one, but the writing style and word usage is atrocious! There are so many ridiculous details that detract from the story (my mother's back would have benefitted), that reading the book becomes a lesson is perseverance. This isn't about the childlike narrator. It is about development of scene that is rich without being gaudy and obnoxious. As much as I hate to leave a story unread, I don't think I can make it through the second book.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|There's a rumor this particular toy was used onscreen, possibly in some stunts so they didn't damage their actual prop. I don't know if that's true. Size-wise, it seems to be pretty comparable to the actual prop used in the show. I wish the LED was blue, but to provide the UV light necessary to reveal the included invisible ink, it's actually purple. I also wish it was slightly louder, but it does make four different sounds and can make them either in the retracted or extended position.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this sonic is not good as a child's toy for the following reasons. First, the slider button for extending the sonic comes off very easily by accident. The part is very small and could be swallowed. Second, the pen component, which can be switched between a black one or invisible ink one, also comes off easily and either pen (or the pen caps) could be lost. While I love this sonic, for those reasons I give it four instead of five stars.
B005R9HK8O|5.0|I have the printed copy of Be Here Now but there are some of the brown center pages that are difficult to read. The enhanced version helped me read and understand more. I also love the videos and meditations!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the display, I can see it without my reading glasses.  I use my calculator plus instead of my desk top calculator every time.<br />It gets the totals quickly and easily, percentages are a big part of my day and they are extra easy on my kindle.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|Amazing movie. Awesome characters. Epic plot. Love the dark humor! Have seen it probably 50 times and could still watch it 50 more!
0316228583|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I love J.K.'s writing. This book made me remember how important it is to not judge people. You never know why people do what they do, Crystal is the perfect example.
B00A0MJ9VY|4.0|So, this blueray copy is not scratched, but will not play. In fact it gets stuck in load mode. My son loves Peter Pan, I guess will need to buy a new DVD from someone else.<br /><br />October 18, 2013<br />Seller sent me replacement movies that work. My son is really happy and I have confidence in any futre orders from this seller, since I know they will take care of any problems I might have.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Always have an alarm clock, because I always have my phone. Easy to setup. Downloaded easy. Would recommend. Plus gives instant weather.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|It saddens me to read about Shirley MacLaine and how her daughter, Sashi, was brought up.  When Shirley was actively writing I bought many of her books eager to read about her latest spiritual journey and through her books hopefully grow myself spiritually.  A decade later I began to re-read her books only to realize they were really all about herself and her lovers and less about spiritual discovery.  It's like she threw in a few moments as teasers.<br /><br />I have little doubt that what Sashi has written has truth behind the stories.  What an awful way to grow up with a manipulative/controlling father and a mother who was in her own little world most of her daughter's life.  Another nail in the celebrity coffin of self-interest and bipolar delusion.  Having been raised in a similar dysfunctional life I relate how Sashi felt as a child and feels as an adult.  I can also understand how cathartic and frightening writing this book for publication probably was as I too have been urged several times to write my own story.<br /><br />Shirley will no doubt ride the wave of negative press and eventually come out the other side a bit battle worn and angry but no doubt publicly she will have her spiritual face firmly in place.  Perhaps Paul will visit and help her put this bombshell in perspective for her.  Sashi, I think, has become a very strong person who I hope will exit this controversy with her head held high and realizing the peace she seeks and deserves.  Sometimes in order to get to the fruit you have to get a better ladder.
1848507836|4.0|This book is an easy read, and worth considering. Not because you might seek a reason for your illness, but as an illustration as to how important it is to be ourselves, to be gracious, tolerant, considerate, loving towards others. To live life for ourself, not for others, yet not forget that others are an important part of our hourney.<br /> It also offers an insight into our own spirituality and the confirmation that our spirit does not die.
B0096SEPAS|5.0|I jumped on this for like $26-a steal for this Japanese issue which usually goes for around $70. The mastering is Steller, probably utilizing the DSD masters for the Abkco era and the later tracks dont sound brickwalled, which was the problem with the 2010 Universal re issues-they sounded like crushed eggs. And even though on some of the later tracks you get the 'edited' for radio versions, it's actually nice for the collector to get those versions in great sound, as their not available anywhere else. So I am very happy with this 3cd version of GRRRRRRR!<br />Gerard Masters
B00F52YOPA|5.0|First hidden object game I can see and play easily on my Kindle fire. I like the extras also. Very challenging with the various games.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Super fun game! I loved SIM city so this is similar! Fast moving and entertaining! Alright now I just have to create words to submit the review
0807208523|5.0|Having this CD with E.B.White narrating was such an asset. My students followed along reading the story as they listened to the actual author...great addition to the lesson!l
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|An insight into Afgahistan from 1948 to today through the various characters who's lives were interwoven like a Persian carpet and connected through place. A well crafted book, unputdownable with an ending that is both touching and sad.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Again, my two year old granddaughter was able to maneuver this game on the Kindle Fire. She can't grasp the 'mouse' concept with a computer, but nailed it on the kindle.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son received this for his 7th birthday and he couldn't believe it when he saw the box. Of course, there's nothing like this available in any stores near us, so he never knew it existed. He went right to work building his Minecraft world.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie... Only wish it followed the book more. I really liked the way the movie held the suspense and mystery and did not give the ending away too soon.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This show is one of my top favorite shows now. Tatiana Maslany is just excellent and talent beyond my expectation. I can't wait for season 2!
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|I only got into the first few challenges before getting stuck with no hints that were useful.<br />I won't be playing this further.
B000I9WWHW|5.0|Bought this a long time ago and still was able to download on my new laptop with no problems.  Everything has been just great.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|Listening to this album makes me feel like i'm in my twenties. It has a uniqueness that I do not hear very often.
B000065K6N|5.0|I love this movie, great story and animation. It is pretty violent so I would not recommend this for children under 13
B005FDWM6M|5.0|Believe it or not, my two year old granddaughter loved this movie. It was great to download on my Kindle Fire and she watched it in every room as I got some chores done. She even learned how to pause it to go potty;). Loved the cost also. I'd recommend as a built in babysitter. I even loved watching it with her.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I owned the entire Original cast movie series of these awsome movies way back in the 80's, but they were all on VHS, and now I have the entire collection on DVD!!! Perfect....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is strangely addicting. I have not been able to put it down since I downloaded it. It's so much fun
B001N3EZW2|5.0|Remarkable when you consider the Time Frame 1956. Setting the Stage for Future Science Fiction Movies such as Star Trek & Star Wars. I watched it in 1957 at the age of 17. Now at 74 I'm still thrilled.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Takes a little getting use to  it provides  you a great deal of information. You can set multiple locations and it free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book!<br /><br />It's amazing! I'm only 11 and I can't wait to read the second book! Catching fire!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|One of their best albums to date; I absolutely love this CD. I can't wait to get ahold of Volume II.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The movie is fast paced and stays true to the Star Trek storyline. I am looking forward to more films.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Analyzing music in detail is rather pointless.  The album creates for me a  distant mood which compliments Ms. Goldfrapp's voice.
B0035V35P8|4.0|This is one of me and my families favorite action movies, we had to replace it because our original copy went missing.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|This is about as close as you can get to an accurate depiction of life at sea in the time period represented.  Excellent cinema-photography.  This film ended too soon and begs for a sequel.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think minion rush is cool but i dont like how you have to pay for points. But besides that its a great game:-)
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great recreation of Kan story line  . Good acting can not wait for the next movie. Hard to top this one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is really cool. It has subways that you jump on, and you buy characters with money you collect while you run. It's super fun and addicting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a mind blowing sequel to an already mind blowing book. It us probably the best book in the whole trilogy. Characters love, fight and learn what the meaning of friendship is.
B005LAIIGW|4.0|\\"Gravity\\" is a space drama genre film packed with enthralling scenes and visual stimulation. The narrative contains numerous anxious moments and it is the uniqueness of these situations in space, which provides the viewer with a sense of awe and regular trepidation. It is an unparalleled space movie experience where the viewer becomes consumed by the hazards of orbit and the will to survive.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I am really enjoying using this app.It seems like a great way to start learning a new language or refresh your memory on previously learned languages. The only thing I don't like is that it teaches words without explanations of why or the reasoning behind it. For example, I am currently learning German with this app. It teaches the different forms of the word the: Die, Der, Du, etc. but there is no reasoning behind why you use a specific form before specific words. Therefore, I have to use other programs to find out. Also, it would be nice to have a few other language choices too.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Its great I always use this when I need help on what a word means and how to spell a word it's easy to find the world you are looking for
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game. It's great fun and always a new challenge. I do get a bit impatient with it sometimes though.
B00BEIYP8A|4.0|\\"Rush\\" is a Formula One racing action genre film, which is based on true events.<br /><br />The narrative for the most part focuses on the rivalry between drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauder (Daniel Bruhl), but it also examines both people in quite some detail.<br /><br />The story also sheds much light on the not so easy path to F1 and the hazardous master it can be. The glitz of F1 is well presented by Hunt and Lauder is the disciplined strategist and innovator. However, in real life both men were playboys in their own ways.<br /><br />It is a movie with plenty of thrills and the journey of Hunt and Lauder certainly gives the viewer much to think about.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
1932100660|3.0|When I got it I lent it to a friend and have never gotten it back.  Probably wouldn't read anyway
B008N1V11U|4.0|Very fun and addictive, but there are some cons. I find it hard to glide. Fighting can sometimes get slow. Other than that very cool. Voices sound exactly like the movies. Pretty good graphics for a handheld. Sound though is awesome.
1400052181|2.0|This book does hopefully garner attention from people who don't normally read science books. That is a good thing. However, while reading it I was disturbed by some misleading statements it makes regarding science. I wish that the author had asked a biologist to read through it before publishing. I've gotten rid of my copy, so I can't quote the misleading areas, but I'd recommend that readers take this book with a grain of salt. It is not a science book; it is a story involving science.
1442359315|1.0|Just because he had  educational  background --does not make him subject to the same biological chemistry  --his delusional trip was all fabricated by his mind --and nothing else --he  said he has all the answers revealed to him  ,yet he never mentions what these answers were ?<br /><br />Also nice way to make  finacial gain ---
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Growing up in the 60's, I've always had a fondness for Star Trek; even enduring the insufferably bad Voyager series and the crappy, odd-numbered original series movies.  I was pretty much over the whole Star Trek gunk that had infested my childhood through early adult years.  Disavowing ever being a 'Trek follower.  But this, along with the first JJ Abrams reinvention are just so much fun to watch.
0736083863|4.0|The illustrations along with the exercises really helps to get to know what muscles are working and what they are called
B00AH69AX0|5.0|This album sees Metallica stitching their wounds and learning to move on. Following the death of bassist Cliff Burton, this is the first effort and a return to the violent, enraged, self-effacing songwriting of Ride the Lightning and the polished production values of Master of Puppets. Is this their best album? That's a matter of opinion. I personally would call it Ride the Lightning, but then again, I'm more of a thrasher. Those looking to Metallica in their rise from thrash to alt-metal iconoclasm would most likely favor Justice above all others. All told, anyone who enjoys Master of Puppets or their self-titled \\"Black\\" album will find this one an excellent bridge and a must-have for their Metallica collection.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The Can You Escape Game is fun and challenging I recommend that every one try it.  The programmer has put a lot of work in it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Enjoyed the game thoroughly. Easier puzzle size is fun for the kids and the more advanced puzzles enraptured me. Great game to play at the airport; hope there's an update with more challenges that comes soon.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Quality stuff. Had a friend who had a pair of AKGs from the 70s, and they still sounded amazing. I was sold.
B001AMWTAG|5.0|As a fairly recent Volbeat convert, I was looking for something with just the right balance of their older and newer sounds, and this one nails it. The songs are varied and well-done, with a sound like Jerry Lee Lewis fronting later Van Halen. It's not really rockabilly, except it is rockabilly, and isn't entirely metal, though it's metal, and so on. Volbeat as a band is difficult to define, and even more so on this album. The only thing I can bring myself to liken it to is Igor and the Red Elvises, though it's very far removed from their sound, subject matter, etc. Really, to understand the album and to decide if it's for you, the best plan is just to give it a listen.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Very intense and exciting!  Can't wait for next series. Will have to wait for next DVD to come out to see.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I really look forward to each and every segment of the season 4 of The Good Wife.  Each show is diverse and exciting drama to watch.  The actors are all perfect in their roles.  You can become addicted to the show very easily.  You can even pick up some pointers on the law along with the enjoyment the series brings.  The series is geared to young adults and adults.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is very good. I like the little details. Like how flash gets a sidecar in the bad as hog and how his ears flap in the wind whilst on Mr.cuddles. It's all very good. My only complaint is that I've unlocked pretty much everything and hate waiting for Friday to show up just to get one new jetpack. Please release more, more frequently. Please! I understand that takes work though so take your time but hurry up! Also thanks for being free to download. That's way too awesome.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This is a very interesting and touching story about a part of US history that had escaped my attention. The author creates a tapestry of characters whose lives were connected by chance and circumstances. Her character and story development are wonderful.
B005PK55BE|3.0|Something's been gnawing at me about this show and I just put my finger on it....well educated women in their early 40s--in the time-period in which this show takes place--don't think or act as this main character does.  Even the title is ridiculous!<br />I've enjoyed most of the performances, and think the court cases we've seen have been exceptional, but the relationships are just sooooooooo far fetched!  Alicia referring to Kalinda as a best friend is ludicrous! Neither character (as written) has shown much interest in getting to know one another beyond case-work or the occasional barroom \\"shot.\\" In regards to the parent/child relationships, Alicia is clueless re: her teenage kids and disregards their emotional well-being, barely answering their questions/concerns about much of anything: again, that kind of hands-off parenting went out of vogue an entire generation ago.<br />I haven't decided if I will keep watching this series or not.  Indeed, I've only stuck with it because it's free with my prime membership.  If I had to pay extra I'd have \\"turned the channel\\" on The Good Wife a long time ago!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Just another game where you move from side to side and jump. I played less than 10 mins. Glad I got to try it for free.
0345803507|5.0|I started reading the first book and just couldn't put them down. I was addicted! Loved and enjoyed the book...
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|If you like memoirs, you will love this book. I had a hard time putting it down. I loved how the author was so brutally honest in her portrayal of her trip hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  She is also very gifted at putting her feelings and experiences into vivid, profound prose.  Best book I have read in a long time.
B001BANK32|5.0|Classic and much better than the movie. Be sure to also read Dr Sleep. King is one of my all-time favs.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Best Star Trek so far! I just wish it had a gag reel and deleted scenes in the special features.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|was questionable but needed a sharpener and this was the best review, and didn't let me down. It is as good as they say it is and small enough to put in pocket or key chain
B000002O5L|5.0|Fabulous old album. I had it on cassette! And obviously had to replace it. Still sounds as good as the day it was released. Love you Tom Petty!
B004EPZ070|4.0|Don't watch if you want it to follow the book.  Otherwise, a good film on it's own.  I love to hate Kate Hudson, she's so cute to watch.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I read this the 1st time in grade school but read it again this summer with my children. The language was definitely explicit and there were sections that were difficult to read due to the dialect but I absolutely love this book and my 12 year-old twins loved it too.
1612930832|5.0|The Master Key System is a guide to looking at your mind, body and soul from the spiritual, psychological, and scientific point of view, complete with mental exercises and meditation processes that will awaken your imagination and enhance your ability to visualize. This book will be of benefit to anyone who reads even the first chapter.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl takes you with her not only on the PCT but into her healing which is a gift. Thank you
B00EX9MH8W|3.0|This is as always an excellent novel.  Jane Austen's writing is unsurpassed in any number of ways; the three star rating comes from the fact that except for the cover, the Kindle edition of this book is NOT illustrated; there is NO illustration at all in the book.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|it is amazingly perfect for kids of any age and I thing people will enjoy it a lot no matter what
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|This game is fast and fun.  Easy enough to keep you going and challenging enough not to hurt.  Took me a day or two to wipe the whole game out but I enjoyed it completely!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Purchased for someone who was really into the Twilight Saga. She was able to watch a couple times on her own time.<br />Thanks, you make gift giving easy.<br />Curt Sims
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|It continues the Star Trek legacy with class.  A good twist on an adversary and a plot any Star Trek fan would recognize.  It also leaves the door wide open to more movies.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I downloaded this to my kindle but it doesn't work, won't run the youtube videos on my tablet at all.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|I grew up on Star Trek and was I expecting a more original story line instead of an episode redone for the third time.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This was a new type of puzzle for me, and I love it. The game plays great on my Kindle Fire.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun, addicting game that works the brain.  Some start out easy, and some you look at and say, \\"Wow, how am I going to figure this one out\\" but the more you do, the better you get at deciphering. Good one to download if you enjoy a challenge.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Since I've read other work by Khaled Hosseini, I was sure I would enjoy this one.  I was not disappointed
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Much better than the film, darker than anything one would expect from youth fiction. Except in these days, I guess. Not for the very young, but great reading fir the tween/teen set (as if you probably didn't already know). Catching Fire has some slow fits and crawls, but they were unavoidable.
B000FC13UE|5.0|Great book, left me wanting more and more. Hope everyone else enjoys it. You will not be disappointed, I promise.

B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Typical , but , some  really  funny  parts.  The  special  effects  make  it  totally  unbelievable, but , the  acting  helps  to  carry  it  thru.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|Love it.  It makes my laps such an easy thing to do.  And great for my neck which doesn't move so great anymore.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This little lady has BIG talent!  -Mind you musician, dancer, violinist AND she's cute ;0. This song is playing continuously on my Mp3 at the moment after hearing it randomly on my Pandora Buddah Bar radio station one day. I got up from my seat to add it to my list of downloads. Enjoy.
0062255657|5.0|This book starts out with moderate realism, but by its climax it has grown to envelop the entire universe, including ancient pagan deities. Magical and awe-inspiring.
B0098460O4|5.0|I love this CD I play it over and over. I hope they keep on making music together they give me cold chills when I listen no matter how many times I've heard them. Great job voices of unbelievable power!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is pretty good but there are a few bugs. I don't like the fact that the pioneers can die. I mean, shouldn't they be able to fend for themselves? I also don't like that you can only have 300 food. I've played other games that have unlimited food storage such as dragonvale. I also don't get the energy thing. If they want people to always keep playing, why do they have the energy thing? Once you run out of energy, you have to wait like three hours before it all comes back but at least that one energy comes back every three minutes. I think that this is a good game, and I give it four stars. But because of all the bugs and pointless additions such as wood limit, storage limits, food (etc.) I had to give this game a four. And because of all the other helpful reviews, I will NOT be updating this game. So other than all the bugs, this had turned out to be a good game
098478280X|5.0|This book is very helpful in trying to study for interviews at the top tech companies or just trying to remember old CS concepts.  It touches on so many concepts and data structures.  Gayle does a great job of also covering interview etiquette which would be useful for recent college grads or people out of practice.  Some problems have multiple solutions and some show a progression of the solution.  This book is staying on my bookshelf and will definitely be a go to resource.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end of the story had finally come to an end and you are left feeling complete and satisfied. Wonderfully written and the reader is kept captivated. Highly recommend.
B007KFZ7RE|4.0|Interesting production value, well done.  I saw him on Daryl Hall's music show on Paladia.  His performance there was better than the disc.  But the disc is good too.  I love that old warm sound.
B00B99U5VK|4.0|TBBT is still the greatest sitcom in the history of the genre, Seinfeld (contrary to popular opinion) isn't even in the same class as TBBT.  However, the sexual innuendo that has begun to overtake the show is totally changing the tone.  I used to be confident that I could watch the show with my teenage son without the fear of feeling awkward from an almost constant barrage of sexual double entendres.  The show doesn't need this element to be highlighted anymore than it had been for the first 5 seasons. I get the double meaning of the title as it refers to physics and the characters attempts to navigate the world of romantic social interaction. This kind of humor is the last refuge of the sitcom that is running out of story lines.  It's become too much and is overshadowing the clever writing that was this show's hallmark for five wonderful seasons.  At least we'll always have streaming from Amazon.com.
B007PEIHKE|5.0|It works perfectly and supports the SRTP encryption. The configuration page is a bit confusing at a first glance, but once you get used to it, you'll be able to configure all Grandstream VoIP products in a matter of seconds!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|The story line was a bit different and it kept you intrigued throughout the whole movie. You never knew what was going to happen.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was a very easy read, captivating you from the start. Clark is a loving individual, with a quirkiness and fun personality. When reading about her and hearing her talk, you can easily imagine what she is like, and embrace her. Getting to know her throughout this book is such a delight. I missed her, once I finished this book. You wanted the storyline to go in a certain direction, and got much joy from the different relationships within this book, but I cried and laughed throughout this book. Thank you to Ms. Moyes for a book I thoroughly enjoyed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this whole series! When I started with the first book of Wool, it took me a few chapters to get into it- since it starts slowly and builds. I'm very glad I kept going, because it is an extremely good read- multi-layered and involving, with characters I really cared about. The themes the author explores transcend sci-fi and raise profound questions about humanity. Yes, there is a lot of detail, sometimes prosaic- but I found that it helped make the characters and their actions even more real to me. AS far as I am concerned- this was a real find- one of the best series I have read- and I read a lot!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Its an Awesome movie, kids watch it at least 3 times a week. I definately recommend it, for your child is in to movies
0307352145|5.0|This is an amazing book, especially for us introverts.  It affirms that we are born this way and are happy to know there are so many of us.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The author is both meticulous and engaging when laying out the science disproving age-old myths about introverts and extroverts. The extensive research is apparent by the number of examples that are relatable and productive in showing the pros and cons of each state of being.<br /><br />Warning: gaining this sense of awareness is powerful and a bit alarming.
B002WY65VU|5.0|If you like zombies and all things a little bit &#34;off&#34;....this is the movie for you.<br />It has suspense, comedy, drama...and gore.  It's the best of all worlds!

I haven't even bought the whole game, but I definitely will!! I totally recommend this game if you love HO games!! And puzzles!!
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|It was a fun game but too short but I would tell people to buy it because the puzzles were the best part.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Wonder is the story of August Pullman, a boy born with significant physical deformities but who, mentally, emotionally, and intellectually is a normal 10 year old.  Auggie, as he is known to his family and friends, has never attended a regular school, having been home schooled by his mom.  Now, as he is about to enter 5th grade in a traditional school for the first time, he must face his fears about how others will look at him and treat him.  These challenges are on top of the normal concerns kids have about making friends and just fitting in.  It would have been easy for the author to make the story syrupy sweet causing the reader to feel bad for Auggie.  Rather than doing so, she let the characters develop naturally, making their own decisions about how they wanted to react to and treat Auggie.<br /><br />I really appreciate the fact that the story presents several different characters' points of view so I was able to see things not only as Auggie sees them but also as they are seen, and experienced, by his friends Summer and Jack as well as his sister Olivia, and Olivia's friend Miranda.  I really liked Jack and Summer who seem to take Auggie for who he is without being judgmental. Granted they have their flaws, yet they remind me of many students I have had over the years.  They enjoy being his friends and never seem to even notice his differences.  They are the kind of friends any kid would love to have.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable story which caused me to look at myself and ask \\"how would I react if/when I met August for the first time?\\"  As I did so I got different answers based upon what stage of my life I was looking at this from.  If I were a child, despite my parents best efforts at raising me to be accepting of everyone's differences, I think that I may very well have reacted the way that many of the kids in the book did, giving him strange looks and possibly even shunning him.  When I looked at him from the perspective of a teacher I hope, and believe, that I would be kind, caring, outgoing, and nonjudgmental. I feel that I am so with students with special needs and expect that this would carry over to a student without any special needs but who just looks different than their peers. This is a well crafted story which I hope my students will read.  As they do so it may well cause them to ask themselves how they would react should they ever encounter Auggie.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|cute book. really neat that they went through some of the trails and tribulation that people often go through and stuck it out together
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Movie was great especially in Blu-ray, as was expected.  Not five stars because I was disappointed in the digital copy.  I was expectlng a digital copy disc not a download.  This turned out to be a hassle, code number didn't work, had to contact Paramount and limit restrictions (I've got several home computers but download limited to one.)

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Oh, Daria, how I love thee. You are as keen as cats and ribald as rats. With your soft blowing brown hair and glasses all 'aharried. Your green jacket so thin and your skirt all 'aruffle, you are indeed a little charmer.<br /><br />I love this show. I can't even begin to say what it would have meant to me to have even known a character like this existed when I went to high school, starting in late 2002. Let's just say it might have meant the difference between outright depression and isolation and perhaps overall acceptance of my situation. But that's not the show's fault, that's TV's fault for all but disappearing the show after it ended. Apparently it was on logo or nogin from time to time throughout the years, but I never really watched those channels way up on the cable channel counter. I remember watching MTV throughout those years but it was always Celebrity Team Death Match or Jackass. A part of me is sad that I didn't at least catch a glimpse of this show when it might have still been on. I was just a dumb boy who liked violence like every other dumb boy.<br /><br />I only finally even knew about the show when the DVD came out, and my, what an impact it did make. I know everyone says this, but I WAS Daria in high school. I realized I had a sight problem early in my Sophomore year, so I had to get glasses and wear them all the time for the first time in my life. I didn't know anything about athletics and was overweight (since fixed with constant exercise, which no one tells you about when you're in high school unless you're already naturally inclined or forced by your parents to be on a sports team) and really looked a drag, I'm sure. I wasn't bullied or anything, just sort of left in the ionosphere, ignored. My only truly difficult year was probably my Senior year, when the cliques were at their greatest maturation and ripeness, and I was doing all the core classes I never wanted to do because I had only taken art classes instead in my freshman year. I remember I was in a certain club that had changed since the last year into an extremely anal experience because the teacher wanted to win awards and accolades. Ok, it was yearbook, and it was awful. A lot of the departments received extra funding and this created new expectations.<br /><br />I was also on drugs for ADHD, even though I now know I probably didn't really have a focus problem but rather I was just lazy. I just didn't care, never did care. I graduated college after high school, having gotten off those big pharma drugs that have the tendency to ruin your life, started exercising, cleaned myself up, and after a bout with depression caused by trying to fit in and smoke MJ with fake friends, I'm now in a much better place. I didn't want to be all personal in an Amazon review, but if there's some lonely high school student out there, I just want them to know it gets better. What Daria teaches us is screw all those people, I have my own life to live. The pressures of society don't matter, just as long as I'm doing ok.<br /><br />I just can't help but remember the horrible time that high school was for me. Daria reveals all of this. The show teaches us that no one has it particularly EASY in high school, even if the popular kids go out of their way to wreck the lives of anyone who is different, which never really ends, by the way. People are dumb, stupid social animals that are, like, engineered to hate nonconformity. Those who continue their education past high school often grow to be enlightened later on though (one hopes).<br /><br />We all go through some sick twisted stuff when we're going through puberty and having to deal with a million different kinds of people and social situations and grades and stress in high school, and no show ever captured this like Daria. Daria isn't exactly an amazing perfect super genius, she has faults and worries, she deals with isolation and gets help from friends and parents as she's growing up in superficial Lawndale. As I watch the show today I see how I was like Daria, and I'm very glad this show is on DVD, and within the reach of anyone who needs it. Even if we are going through it alone we can know that there's been millions of people who have been disenfranchised through an establishment of order like high school, and there's understanding. Certainly it seems the writers understood that high school wasn't all about being perky and buying the next clothing line or corporate product. High School can be REAL MISERY. I think it's important we give each other a break when we're in high school, or at least the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />If I had only had this show in 2002, I think it would have made a difference. When I watched the whole thing through two years ago it was an enormous epiphany. I realized I WASN'T alone. It was like a total moment of clarity, like a cleansing of the soul. I didn't have to carry those old memories on my back so much anymore. All I ever needed was for someone to understand. No tv show ever had that kind of impact on me. It was sort of like reading Harry Potter, the hero isn't some perfect superchampion with six pack abs, just a regular kid who got a bad deal. I guess I didn't have to hate myself anymore after Daria, I could sympathize with my old self and the difficulty of the whole High School situation. Not that running a lot didn't help that too.<br /><br />Finally, the music makes no difference to me. I was born too late to have ever been a big fan of that millenium music anyways. I watched a few episodes on some Russian site with the music still in and found it distracting. I listen to more than enough music on my own, I don't need MTV music propaganda hovering through the best moments of the show. Without the music the show is more timeless, I think, even if it may add context for certain key situations. I'm sure if they ever did release the show with the music intact I'd watch it just to compare, but I'd rather have all the episodes in good picture quality than anything else.<br /><br />Also, the first season or so is where it's really at. The show had already begun a slow fade after season three. The 2000s would not be kind to the ideals of Daria. I watch these episodes from '97 and 2000 and I think, wow, what a bunch of complainers! haha! Most of us young people don't even have the opportunity to work anymore, we can't even get full time jobs! There'll be a line of dialogue and I'll be like, oh, just wait until Bush gets into office! Then you'll REALLY be depressed! In fact the whole Lane family is living on the street in 2013. There's hardly any Time magazine or National Geographic paying huge sums for Celtic Rock formation photos anymore, or consumer money to pay for bad pottery or paintings. Daria is completely the product of an American economy that was actually working for all the people, the intellectuals, the scientists, the creative types, rather than just the business executives. Jodie and her family would be doing great. I don't even want to think about Kevin and Brittany, although I think they might have gotten tons of work in the superficial Bush Era 2000s.<br /><br />America is such a screwed up nation now compared to 1997, there's no time to complain about existential conundrums that were summed up so well on the show Seinfeld and Daria as well. It's hard just to keep a job now! I watch this show and I think, lucky b@$#%&^!, I'd a' had my 401k set up by the crisis in 2008! Course then it would have just been wiped out. They had no idea all the crap that was coming down the pipe by the time the show had stopped being written--probably by the end of summer 2001. I wonder if they were still writing that last movie when the towers got hit?<br /><br />Daria puts me in a mood of nostalgia, as you might or might not be able to tell, a very strong sense of the past. If they were to make new episodes of this show today I think it might just be the greatest thing ever, way better than Beavis and Butthead coming back (no music videos to fart on anymore). Daria would likely have plenty to say about our modern world.<br /><br />And that stuff's being said every night on the Colbert Report, which I don't watch.<br /><br />peace.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My big disappointment is that I have to wait for several months to begin watching the new episodes of this fantastic series. I've watched all of the episodes to catch up and can hardly wait for new ones. The acting, costumes, and story line are top-notch. This series is well worth your time, if you appreciate period stories.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|It has been a long time since I read this book, I picked it up at the airport on a flight out of the US.  I guess I didn't stop reading since when we landed 10 hrs later I was just finishing and hadn't realized we had arrived at our destination.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and it is one of my top 5 favorites.  I also enjoyed the Lady and the Unicorn.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Let's face it: Janis Joplin's voice is an acquired taste, but once it's acquired, it's awesome. Raspy, cracky, whiny, but very bluesy, it's the perfect fit for the blues/psychedelic rock that permeated the late 60's. This compilation is just right for the casual Janis fan, with such classics as PIECE OF MY HEART, ME AND BOBBY MCGEE, CRY BABY, and BALL AND CHAIN. Then there are the somewhat lesser known but still great tracks like SUMMERTIME, in which Janis' vocals crack me up, due to their somewhat strained tone. All in all, Janis Joplin's greatest hits is a must-have for fans of late 60's blues and psychedelic rock. Janis has been gone for decades, but her music lives on through this perfect collection of hits.

B001EC2ISA|5.0|Very, Very funny video. Great for the whole family! I would recommend this movie to any of my friends and family.
B003XYERRM|5.0|SKP sets the bar for historical novels. And, this novel, of all her novels epitomizes her gift for storytelling.<br /><br />Received this as a Xmas present from a fellow bookholic and, yup, admit that rather than focusing on the books for grad school finals, I was engrossed in the medieval world. A fairly sympathetic view of Richard III is captured in the book but it is the family dynamics and the machinations behind the throne that pits the Grey, Warwick, and York family that would rival any sudsy drama on TV.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|We need more movies like this movie. It is nice to see how some of the young people have come along.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I bought the pin so I could be Captain Kirk for Halloween.  It came in a timely fashion with all its pieces (namely the two pin covers on the back) and was in perfect condition.  The two pins on its back hold it up very well instead of letting it get top heavy or wobble around too much.<br /><br />Now if you wanted to get really detail oriented I can tell you that you can see the small scratches in the metal from being formed.  But they are so small that you can't see them unless you look hard and it is still smooth and lustrous like the picture.  I find I like the little things because they give it a bit of texture and maybe indicate that Captain Kirk has already gone through some battles.<br /><br />Be assured that if you want a Star Trek captain's badge then this is the one you should be getting.  It is a great size (big enough to not get lost in the fabric or anything) and weight (not too heavy to pull down your shirt but heavy enough to lay right and solidly).
0345803485|5.0|I'm in love with this book. I can't put the book down. I've been reading one chapter every day and I'm also done with it. I'm can't for the movie adaption because Charlie Hunan is playing Christian Grey AAAHHHHHHHH!

B008JFUO72|1.0|I just watched the movie for the first time on DVD last night, and now this morning I'm still upset with it, so here goes the rant.<br /><br />There are a lot of good things in the movie, which makes it seem like it's a continuation of the very good Iron Man I and II, but it slowly loses its grip on reality and the last 10 minutes are absolutely horrible. So let's start with a list of retcons.<br /><br />1. Tony is back in Malibu, his original house, not the Stark Tower built in Avengers.<br />2. Tony has anxiety attacks rather than physical problems to solve.<br />3. His armor splits into pieces that fly and operate on their own rather than being powered by 1 arc reactor.<br />4. War Machine opens like the armor in Avengers, but War Machine is the Mark I and we know how that has to be opened by an external machine seen in Iron Man I.<br />5. Pepper isn't familiar with Tony's former girlfriends and disapproves of them...but she was his personal assistant who 'took out the trash' with them multiple times, and even said that lifestyle was 'ok.'<br />6. Tony becomes stupid, not remembering how his own tech works and has to be reminded by Jarvis, and can't even take down 3 pathetic attack helicopters when he is in his newest armor. And he knows the attack is coming, because he invited the Mandarin 'to his house.'<br />7. The armor isn't air tight, and he gets water in it. In Iron man I and Avengers he goes into space, therefore it is air tight.<br />8. The armor can now be cut in half by the touch of a very hot hand...but only got nicked a bit by Whiplash's energized lashes.<br />9. Tony can't seem to measure distance, because he tells Pepper to let go and he'll catch her, then he misses by a mile with no outside interference. The man is a mechanical genius and has an eye for detail, yet he overestimates the reach of his arm by half a meter? No.<br />10. War Machine can be worn and operated by anyone, not just Tony and Rhodey, including the President.<br />11. Tony building in his workshop is now obsessive behavior jeopardizing his relationship with Pepper.<br />12. Tony's armor is now a 'cocoon' that is holding him back in life.<br />13. The armor and being Iron man is now holding him back from being with Pepper. In Avengers she encourages him to 'do his homework.'<br />14. Tony can have surgery to remove the shrapnel in his chest...this is a big one, and directly contradicts Iron man I and II. In II Tony was dying because he had to have the arc reactor in his chest. Why not have the surgery then?<br />15. Being a superhero, saving the day and people's lives, is now a negative. That's not the Iron man we saw in Avengers who has accepted his role and is happy with it.<br />16. Rhodey leaves the fight to get the President away from harm...and never comes back to help. That is not his character, who would never leave Tony hanging.<br />17. Pepper suddenly turns into a badass fighter with moves that she had no right pulling off.<br />18. Iron Man doesn't do combat missions anymore. Suddenly that's War Machine's job.<br />19. Iron Man's plethora of weapons in his armor suddenly disappears.<br />20. General physics, which was adhered to pretty well in Iron man I, II, and Avengers get thrown out the window with Extremis.<br /><br />Overall, the theme is 'being a superhero is a temporary cool thing that becomes a negative and must be abandoned in order to live a happy, normal life.' By the end of the movie Tony's armor is a bad thing that he has to destroy to get his life back, get Pepper back, and fully heal. THAT isn't Iron Man, and is completely contradictory to what we see in I, II, and Avengers. This movie takes a superhero and turns him into a broken man who has to return to the bliss that is 'being normal,' and that is a total betrayal of the series and of the character.<br /><br />This is a movie I really wish hadn't been made and that I hadn't seen. It leaves a sick feeling in your stomach afterwards, and a sense of WTF just happened? Someone else compared it to \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" and I have to agree that a similar hatchet job was done here. In the end the only thing that matters is getting the girl and living a normal life. But Ironman can't live a normal life. He HAS to have the arc reactor in his chest or he'll die.<br /><br />Not in this movie. He gets surgery, is fully healed, and even chucks the miniaturized arc reactor into the ocean, effectively saying good riddance.<br /><br />This movie just makes me want to puke.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very easy reading and extremely motivational - a real eye opener. I had results from the first exercise within hours!
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|Is this a good game? I have no idea, all I get is an error message, and then nothing. While the error message is well crafted, the game has yet to impress me.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|1) Have ordered the movie being a prime member and got the package in 2 days<br />2) Package quality is good<br />3) Movie quality is good<br />4) 3D effects are good while watching on LG tv
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator would be better if you could see a &#34;calculator tape&#34; showing the numbers that were input  to arrive at the result.  That way you can check for  '&#34;fat fingers&#34;
B00CH87HF4|5.0|E-mail oz fun game. No need to spend money on the game if you can work for everything. Easily one of the better games I've played on my tablet.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is so awesome I would send this to everyone I know. This game is very challenging for me and I love that.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very well written riveting suspenseful novel affecting the lives of three women in Australia. A unique story that wraps up beautifully although a bid sad.  A good read.  You will want to get to the end to see what happens.  It's quite a surprise.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|None of the scenes go too far for young teens.  It is a sweet love story with a modern edge.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from Phantom when I started it up.  I thought the premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with what I got.  I've never watched any submarine movies before so I didn't really have any expectations.  I was also a little confused on the whole Americans playing Russians thing, but I let that go pretty quickly.  If you can just sit back, relax, not put too much faith in the movie following the true events, and let the movie do it's thing, you should have a fun ride.  I found Phantom engaging, suspenseful, and emotional all at the same time.  I also recommend watching the special features; they are interesting and add to the movie.  All in all, I recommend this movie if the plot peaks your interest in the slightest.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a great read that covers a lot of history in an easily read novel. It's worth the time.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Sir Elton/Bernie have went back to the roots of the music and injected timeless melodies, intertwined ideas that were once already written and figured out how to breathe life back into them. These are songs that harken to Madman/Tumbleweed yet are new and the most beautiful timeless songs ever written (yet once again they are new). Superb vocals. Great piano. I can't stop listening to it. This, people out there who want to write songs, is how you do it!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you Elton/Bernie.

B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is just AMAZING! For the people who can't take good photos or selfies go ahead and install this app. You won't waste a penny.
B00CHVJI08|4.0|I took my son and his friend to this movie in the theater having no idea what to expect.  It was great!  They loved it and I was thoroughly entertained as well!  Now that we got the DVD my son also loves that it came with &#34;Belt&#34;.  My only problem with it is the case.  I also have a toddler.  An active, climbing, curious, not gentle toddler that I can't seem to keep out of the movies on the shelves.  This particular case is so thin and flexible that I'm sure the first time he gets a hold of it CRACK! It'll be gone :(. As a target audience of families that often have young children I'd think they'd put a little more consideration into packaging.  Maybe they want us to rush out and buy more copies.  It's a great movie, but nope.
B005PK56TA|3.0|When compared with HELL ON WHEELS or BREAKING BAD this series just doesn't offer the fascinating aspect of story content or character development.  I have only just begun to watch so perhaps it will get more interesting as I get deeper into the story line.
B003F1PEDY|3.0|I only purchased this video for a homework assignment, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie after all,
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Since this movie was first out I have seen it a dozen times in the theater, purchased it on VHS (actually have one copy unopened), purchased it on DVD and then purchased it on Blu-ray.  Needless to say one of my favorite movies of all times.<br />My husband and I have purchased Bose sound systems on two occasions and each time the Lion King is my way of judging if the sound system is worth the price we paid for it.  So far the Lion King and Bose have not let us down.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best version of Hamlet. It is the entire play; nothing is left out, as with many other film versions of Hamlet, which get cut down to make it shorter. There is also such a great cast: Kenneth Branagh, Derek Jacobi, Kate Winslet, Richard Briers, Timothy Spall, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and many others.<br /><br />I also love the book that came with the Blu-ray, which includes notes on making the movie, and bios of the main characters.<br /><br />A fantastic retelling of Shakespeare's masterpiece. If you love Shakespeare, you'll love Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Tried lots of keyboards this is the best of all... Great feature set happy user no complaints so far do feel little slowness opening up after long period
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is very cute and the ponies are adorable. But  you pay WAY to much for characters.If they dropped the price down I'm sure more people would BUY THE FLIPPING PONIES.But anyway I like the game but like I said before DROP THE PRICES GAMELOFT!!!!!!!!
0316204366|5.0|I've read every one of Gladwell's books.  This was certainly the easiest of the collection to digest.  I find a few of his book a little \\"thick\\" for my taste and hard to follow.  But this one was great.  Excellent arguments on topics I've always been curious about.  Like \\"When is too much money...too much?\\"  I loved it.  Recommended read and a great conversation book.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|New songs, classic Rod Stewart.  A gift for my husband but I listen to it most.  He sounds great, shares his soul and his heart in these songs.  A new favorite CD!

8189988042|5.0|I loved this book!<br /><br />Seven Spiritual Laws is one of my all time favorites. It is a quick read with only 111 pages, a requirement while I was still Chinese medical school. I loved the concept on creating wealth through effortless thought tapping into ones abundance, balance and harmony. I have re-read it many times since then, and I have adopted the seven principals into my own \\"Ten Universal Spiritual Laws.\\" Being an advocate of natural laws that govern creation, this book shattered myths that I had learned about success - the result of my hard work and being driven by ambition. Indeed, Chopra offered me a new life-altering perspective causing a changed in my perception on the attainment of success. I realized, \\"I am already successful.\\" I simply had to become awake, alert and aware of what I wanted and move toward that as my deep, driving desire. \\"It already is!\\" It took some time to truly comprehend the depth of Deepak's teachings. Take the leap. Read it. Process it. Practice it. This book is filled with ancient wisdom; quantum thought and simple steps one can apply right away. Ditto: If you haven't read Deepak, start with this one!<br /><br />Sending Love and Light<br />Saquina Akanni<br />[...]
B00E9P959O|5.0|Vapor Trails was always an album that I enjoyed, but it didn't have the replay / re-listening value of most of their other works. This album fell farther and farther into the \\"... haven't listened to this one in ages\\" pile.<br /><br />However, I really do enjoy the new mix. It uncovers a lot of details that just weren't there before, clears up the muddiness, and makes for a more enjoyable listening experience.<br /><br />If you were on the fence about this album before, it's well worth a revisit.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|loving it!!! play play play than play again if you thought angry birds wad fun before, than you must try this version

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I can share info and things that interest me and things I love or want to remember and its all organized and easy to find.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Awesome but it needs to let the game trade coins for gems if someone run out of gems in game
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|has someone obviously sounded like an earthquake about to hit the music industry.  The fact that she's 16 is mind boggling.  It doesn't matter whether you see the video or hear the song on the radio, the power and importance of this music hits you right between the eyes.  There has been amazing music made in my lifetime but this kind of thing happens maybe every 20 years.  Adele who?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very satisfying book, tied up nicely. Stephen King is a genius. Anyone who loved The Shining needs to read this to close the circle on Danny and his family.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie has done it again!  Great story, real characters in a believable modern day mystery.  Laughed and couldn't put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The great thing about this is that it doesn't matter how old you are because everyone can enjoy the Despicable fun!! Even my mother enjoys it and she doesn't even know the movie!

B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I love the imagery! Jeff tells the story in such a way that you feel like you are there. I love Dexter and I feel like I know what he's going through.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a fun game that makes you think while you play. I just really like it. Everyone should play it.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|Too violent. The original release was a better version. The uncut version is too gross where it does not need to be.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like this game because you can get really cool dragons and bred them to if you want to get the game I say it's a really good game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use and it has a nice display. I use it often to add up bills. Very convenient to have. Numbers are big also.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I just started playing this game and quickly became addicted to it! It really makes you think! I love it! :)
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Amazon is the worse place to get Gameloft games.  Any game I've downloaded from here has stopped working because of Amazon's updater.  Oregon Trail, Ice Age, etc.  If you want one of those games, head to the actual Play store and get it from there.  I've learned my lesson...<br /><br />That being said - I was able to get around the most recent update issue with this game by doing just what I said above (more detailed steps below).  I can't guarantee that this'll work for everyone, I just know it worked for me with my Galaxy S4 from T-Mobile with the stock build (I haven't rooted it or does any other software modes to it).  I only have the one phone to try it on, so this is hardly an adequate test run, but if you've got nothing to lose and just want to play again, give it a shot.<br /><br />Steps to get Ice Age to update so that it stops prompting you to go to Amazon (where the update is missing):<br /><br />1. Create an icon on your homescreen for the game (mine lives in a folder, but it would probably work as a stand alone in earlier android versions that didn't have folder structures).  Make sure that when you click on the link it brings up the \\"you must update!!\\" screen.<br />2. Go to the Google Play store, search for the game and install it.<br />3. Once installed, open and run the game.  It does ANOTHER update.  Then it'll go through the opening screens and leave you with a beginner village.<br />4. Close that version.<br />5. Go back to your home screen and open the shortcut you created before - this should pick up the update from Google, and let you into your saved Amazon village.<br /><br />If it works for you - great, glad I could help.  If it doesn't - at least it was worth a try...  I don't work for Gameloft, Amazon, or Google, so I don't know why it works, it just seemed to work for me.
0679809015|5.0|Great little book for keeping in the car. (And I do mean little - check out the dimensions!)<br /><br />The baby loves to lift up the flaps to see the animals underneath. The illustrations are good, and it is sturdily made.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B005M0R4X4|3.0|The program was great...however one vital element was not included...the Christmas special.(which told so much of the story.) I was unaware until I started watching season 3; thinking I wad on the wrong disc.  oh well.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Not bad. Not great. I still cannot get over Brad Pitt in a Zombie movie. This definitely has potential for a sequel, and it does not have to have the same actors.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I LIKE playing this.  Very relaxing for me.  I do have a problem with eye strain.  I WISH  THAT could be fixed.
630587493X|5.0|I have had this movie for some time.. Something for the whole family to watch. Some of Robin's best work I think.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Overall, this is an amazing package!  Not only do you get the best 3D version of the film, but you also receive a full sized version of the Phaser prop from the film.  While it does in fact have the rotating feature on the barrel, I do wish it was automatic, as in the film version (but that's only a minor wish).  Actually on the whole, it's quite a sweet package for the price (well under $100)!
0307477479|4.0|This one is a little light on plot, but great on character and told in a fresh and interesting way.  It's not told in your traditional linear storyline kind of way.  It has lots of interconnecting stories and character connections woven together loosely, jumping back and forth from one person narrating to another, and one time period to another.  I liked it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think personally that the multiplier mode is ultimately the best feature for the game. The creativity that explores In this certain game is great for adults and kids.<br />Sincerely, New York Times
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|A welcome addition to my collection. A good value two movies for the price of one. One for the DVD changer and the other for the Blu-ray.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|In the future, England is ruled by Adam Sutler, a charismatic figure<br />who rules with an iron fist.  One night, a woman named Evey is attacked<br />and saved by a Mysterious figure named V. . .the revolution has begun!<br /><br />Based on the graphic novel, I never saw this in theaters, but heard about<br />this and had to buy it.  There are changes from the graphic novel to the<br />film.  I wish that some elements and larger story had made it to film, but<br />there is only so much time.  However it has great action and made a credible<br />story with the cuts and changes to the material.  I would suggest that you<br />read the graphic novel along with watching the film.  Must watch!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I got this book having never read any of Rainbow Rowell's books before. Within the first chapter I knew this book was going to consume me. I love this book. I found Cath to be very relatable to me and it made it easy to get lost. Through the ups and downs I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to everyone. It's an awesome read and I will be reading the rest of Rainbow Rowell's books that are currently published and her new release this spring.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I have tried to read and understand what this Dr. has gone through. Some of it I can comprehend but most of it is scientific gibberish that only his Fellow Scientist can understand. I think that is who he wrote it for anyway not the everyday person. I'm not saying I don't believe he had an out of body experience. I believe he wrote it to try to prove to his friends and fellows that there is something to the supernatural other than here on earth, or the so called Higher Power, and he experienced that higher realm of unconsciousness.<br />I do believe that if you want to be close to the Lord you have to forget everything else here on earth and concentrate only on Him. When I look at myself I am smaller than a grain of sand and yet when I call on the Lord he always comes through. And by the way his Name is not OM (that is a new age term), it is Jesus and the only way you can get through to the Lord is through Jesus. He is the one that gave his life for my sins and will until I die. Bud Knox in Alaska<br /><br />I have this friend.<br />First let me explain what my definition of a friend is. If you call someone your friend, to me it means you have given them your complete trust and they have done the same. It is the same as in a marriage. When you take the vows of marriage that person is your most trusted friend and you have to lay down your life for them they would do the same. This bond is something that takes on a certain character over the years. It takes trials and tears otherwise your just acquaintances.<br />Sometimes I let my friend down or disappoint him. I think he must be upset with me but he always forgives me and says don't worry I will always be here for you. I tell him I'm sorry and I will not hurt him again. Of course he knows that because he trust me. My friend is always with me. He proved he loved me when he gave his life for me.<br />Bud Knox<br />02/14/2013
B0055PGUYU|1.0|The page for this title shows it is available in kindle version, but the option pull down menu allows only selecting hardcover or audio CD.  (Another page is also dedicated to hard cover or paperback, so it's not like I'm lost.)<br />This is vexing, since I was downloading it as an e-lending title from my town library, which expires in 7 days.<br />Tic toc<br /><br />Can Amazon not do this? Do you not have algorithms to prevent such? Seriously guys, is this a habit?
B0029NY9Y4|5.0|In 1985, a hero named the Comedian was murdered and some of his old<br />teammates seek to find out who did it and why as the world lurks<br />on the brink of nuclear war. . .<br /><br />Based on the graphic novel, the film captures the essence of the<br />novel in its characters and plot.  However certain things are altered<br />to serve the film format so I would suggest that you read the novel<br />as well.  It is at times violent, dark, and grimy.  Such is the world<br />of the Watchmen.  There are a few sexual scenes and nudity in the film.<br />Must watch of anyone who loves superheroes.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|I've enjoyed &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; since reading, and rereading, Heinlein's novel as a teenager.  The story, a tie in with the movie trilogy, is well plotted, the action abounds, the animation is superb.  Scifi fans will enjoy it.<br /><br />Animation makes for more bugs, more action and the addition of personal powered armor originally envisioned by Robert Heinlein.<br /><br />Well worth the time.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I was happy with this little guy.  Its simple to use sounds good an seems to be built solid.  From the price of it i expected it to be light in weight and made with cheap plastics but its actually heavier than it looks and thats always good right?
1439152810|5.0|In full disclosure, Kate Morton's prior 3 books are in my list of good reads. I had high expectations for this newest one, and it did not disappoint!  It was great. The only negative is that it had to end.<br /><br />As usual, Kate Morton does a wonderful job at writing about characters in two time periods.  It jumps between one time period to the other, and delves into the stories of 2-3 characters.  But, what I like about her writing is that she brings it all together at the end.  Like her other books, there is usually an unexpected twist at the end.<br /><br />This book was a like a rock rolling downhill.  It gained momentum as it went. It was a mystery, a love story, and just a good character study.  Often wondering what my elders were like when they were young, Ms. Morton writes along this thread in her novels.  I love it!  I have to hope she will write some more!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|awesome game. loads of fun. huge amount of things to find and eat. evolving your shark takes alot of time and fun. hours of enjo
B00ALCBU4M|1.0|Too many continuity problems, lame special effects and a plot that leaves mostly everything to be desired.  If you can turn your brain off, you can watch the movie.  Otherwise, it's worth watching just to pick out the errors.
B004PE1SZ8|5.0|Excellent film!  Definitely a classic recording.  I would gladly recommend this as an addition to anyone's personal home collection! A

B000AS4L16|5.0|This is a documentary collecting the first hand accounts of survivors, witnesses and, in some cases, the perpetrators of the deaths of six million Jews, as well as millions more political prisoners, so-called unter menchen, prisoners of war and others.<br /><br />If you know about the Holocaust and haven't seen this documentary, then your understanding isn't complete.  If you know nothing of this action by Hitler's regime, then this will give you some idea of the scope of loss, suffering, depravity and the depths to which normal human beings can sink when a charismatic leader sets an evil course for his nation.<br /><br />Not for the weak.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|fun to play while you have to wait with a friend. It passes the time in a quick fun way,
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is very well written and the author makes you were really there.  It is a different book, that made me realized how small things matter the most.
B001FB5634|4.0|The movie version of [[ASIN:0307387895 The Road]] removes much of the confusion from McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, but comes up short when retaining its full emotional meaning. The movie is hauntingly sorrowful, keeping McCarthy's original prose--both in narrative and dialogue--but removes some of the content for sake of storytelling.<br /><br />The movie does an excellent job of progressing the story naturally, even choosing to move McCarthy's foreshadowing elements to the rear of the movie. What is left on screen is a naturally flowing story that doesn't stumble for the sake of art.<br /><br />The intent and prose is much the same, but small elements were added to take off some of the biting edge of the book. Without spoiling things for either the reader or viewer, the following scenes in the movie were softened by changing elements in the book: the coke can scene, the bunker leaving scene, and the beach family scene. The changed elements are subtle, but are enough to smooth out the puncturing effects of the book.<br /><br />Make no mistake; the movie is still heavy and brutal. The filming is beautiful (characters walking along a pool of water reflecting the fiery backdrop) and moving (perfectly scored musical accompaniment--my pet peeve of what was missing in [[ASIN:B006H8JJXS No Country For Old Men]]'s adaptation from McCarthy's novel).<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book, but the movie stands on its own merit and actually makes the story more digestible due to making clear some of McCarthy's artistic choices made in his book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a fantastic way to end the series. It was riveting all the way through and I never knew exactly where it would go. Many characters died but none felt cheap. Each character had a well-earned resolution to their storyline.
0345803485|2.0|plotless, trite, repetitious, characters were not believable. things that were meant to be funny were ridiculous--ie inner goddess doing a dance and oh crap--over and over again. wow, just can't believe anyone would think it was good enough to buy. wish i had read some reviews first and saved myself the money.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is the perfect show for people who like survival, action, and a hint of sci-fi! I would highly recommend this show and season to anyone.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling's description of the intertwined lives of the people in Pagford tells a story of a small town at war with itself. The different perspectives give the book depth of character and an appreciation for the individuals throughout the story. Well done.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Strong, multiple character arcs; tense suspense; exquisite setting; perfect pacing per episode.  This is brilliant on every level.  Olivia Colman and David Tennant lead an amazing cast.  Other multiple episode stories have annoying gimicky red herrings while Chris Chibnall respects our love of strong, well-developed characters---yes, we come to fully believe in the possible guilt of so many even simultaneously, but unlike other stretched story-arcs, we are not tricked but satiated with great stories feeding into the primary story.  Chibnall is brilliant and this is his finest work so far.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1602901023 Julia's Quest]]<br />[[ASIN:1602900477 Light at Summer's End]]

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Amazing! This movie gets you into the mind of someone with schizophrenia and really helps you to understand their point of view and their frustration. Russell Crowe does a fabulous job. He is an amazing actor. The film is based on a true story, and that makes it even better. I really enjoyed this so much and have shared it with friends who have family members or friends with schizophrenia. They loved it, too.
0525478817|5.0|this book is absolutely amazing. I would recommend it to anyone.  John green is one of the best authors of this time.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|What an undertaking.  I cannot imagine how they got some of these scenes.  Things no motivated tourist, who spent years visiting each one of these remote locations, would ever get to see.  It requires years, a team of hundreds, spanned out all over the globe, and a BIG budget, to pull this off.  Being able to get a copy of the edited end product of all that for less than $100 is incredible.  Anyone who loves our globe and its many life forms, or great footage, or who has kids and loves them, should buy this.  Hope this helps.  Trey
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Had a hard time at first, connecting the characters.then the puzzle came together. All around the walk between the twin towers.
140006922X|3.0|The author has done his best to pen a story about the historical Jesus though with a lot of problems:<br />1. The Islamic undertone is very present and you can sense it from first page to the last.<br />  Like a car dealership agent who is saying that bicycles are better than cars but what he is really telling is that bikes make you sweat and the car is better.<br /><br />2. Many historical inaccuracies like Jesus was punished by the Romans for sedition but the truth, it was an accommodation to the request of the priests and the mob.<br /> Pontius Pilate washed his hands because he did not discern any crime or illegal act committed against Rome.<br /><br />3. It is more of a story of fiction in the setting of questionable historical facts. Like he questioned the historical accuracy of the gospels because there were no corroborating historical facts but the problem, he is not putting forward any historical evidence that negated the gospel's narrative but rather conjectures (not inferences as he is fond of saying in the book)<br /><br />4. If anyone wants to know the historical Jesus, one should start in the gospel of Luke and go outward from there. The gospel of Luke delved into the historical Jesus and he went into Israel not Palestine (a modern invention) to investigate about Jesus from the people who had first hand knowledge about him and put Jesus in the lens of the current geopolitical climate at that time. And his investigative quest was nearest to the life and death of Jesus and not thousands of years after.<br /><br />Not like the so called scholars who made their investigations from historical books and their own hypothesis without putting their boots on the ground with a gap of hundreds to thousands of years after the event.<br /><br />5. He has only basic understanding of the Bible and also basic knowledge of history despite his impressive degrees including a doctorate degree. We have this misconception that once a person has a degree like PhD, he is already an expert in something when the truth is, a lot of people with degrees has really nothing to say when they open their mouths. That's why in order to cover their meager understanding of things, they try to get a lot of educational degrees to impress people and mislead.

B0064W67IM|5.0|I enjoyed this new edition of vol 1 of The Sandman. Bought it on kindle for $12, it contains 8 comics. It reads better on an iPad than a kindle paper white because the panels being originally colour work best viewed in colour.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really a good mystery game. I loved the map - made travel between levels and rooms very logical. And with every hidden object room you had a choice whether to search or to play a dominoes game for the same reward. So if you like searching - search. But if you don't feel like it, play dominoes. As far as the story, it's a &quot;find, save, spouse and others&quot; premise. They are lost and/or possessed. Pretty interesting; good graphics, sound was good, and no glitches on kindle fire hd. Note that the description states you will pay to unlock, other reviewers must not read that line even though it's right beside G5' s description of the game. What they don't say is that after a year on the market, they still want $4.99. The demo portion is quite long and believe me, you will most likely be hooked and want to keep playing!! I say give it a try...it's a very entertaining mystery game.

B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Very much like Richard Matheson's I am Legend, so I like to think of this film as a companion or sidequel to that story. I imagine that while Robert Neville is hunting vampires down in New York, the characters in this film are facing their own problems. A bit slow at times and lacks a little direction on the part of the main characters, as well as them not taking enough safety precautions by sleeping out in the open at times, but that created the much needed drama. Overall, not a bad film and managed to have a few surprises.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|[[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]]<br /><br />i have read some of the earlier ndes which read like fiction. but dr eben alexander's journey is surely believable, because it is by a person who himself was a non-believer. the details of his experience on a day to day basis and the juxtaposition of what his dear and near ones were going through, makes it such an absorbing reading. and his linking of everything to understandable science - not too much mumbo-jumbo, is what makes this book top of the class for me. sure, there are still some questions that bother me. but that does not in anyway deter me from reading this book again.

1781162646|5.0|I was on Amazon searching for something and stumbled across this book.  Being a huge S. King fan I had to immediately purchase.  I was not disappointed - I loved the story!
0143118439|4.0|First - this is NOT a self-help book, nor is it intended to be one. This is one woman's journey through a period in her life that encompasses some major difficulties and her attempt to regain a sense of balance. For the people who condemn her for being selfish, why shouldn't she write about her experiences? She's not trying to convert you to anything. She's writing a personal story. It seems like so many people are upset that she dared to be a flawed human being. Get over yourselves! Why should someone who has had success in many areas not be entitled to feel incomplete and unhappy?<br /><br />Okay, now that I've got that off my chest, let me give my opinion of the book. I like it, some parts more than others. It's well written and covers a lot of topics, but they are her topics, so not all strike a chord with me. That's not a problem with the book - it's just fact. Not everyone connects to the same things. She does a lot of things I admire her for, not the least being her willingness to expose herself so completely. That takes some courage. Do I agree with her views on things? Not always, but I can appreciate her search for answers. I can sympathize with some of the painful situations she goes through, even though I haven't gone through a lot of them myself.<br /><br />I saw the movie before I read the book and liked it, but I like the book better as it goes into more depth than could be covered in a movie. Sometimes the wordiness of the books gets tedious, but I just skim over various parts as needed. Each time I read the book, I connect with different sections depending on what my state is at the time, but there are a couple of sections that I seem to focus on each time.<br /><br />If you are not interested in reading a baring of someone's soul, don't bother with this book. Certainly don't read it just because it was made into a movie or someone recommended it, unless you are willing to accept the writer's words as their truth without judgement. It's a personal story and should be taken as such - not a guide on how to live your life. What worked for her would probably not be right for you, but her willingness to share her experiences might open your eyes to some possibilities and offer ideas that you can explore in your own life.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The Quarter Quell is over, District 12 is destroyed, and Katniss finds herself at the center of a revolution she gets credit for starting. She and her family are safe -- so to speak -- in District 13, while Peeta has been captured by the Capitol and seems to be serving as their mouthpiece against the uprising. To counter his influence, Katniss is asked by the rebel leaders to take advantage of her status as the symbol of the Revolution by being their public face. Hijacked broadcasts of strategically timed photo-ops become the order of her day; Katniss' growing rage and rebellion at this stricture drives her in directions that could cripple the budding independence movement forever.<br /><br />The action takes place largely in the underground District 13 headquarters of the rebellion, and the reader can easily understand the increasing sense of entrapment and claustrophobia Katniss feels at being confined and closeted away from the fresh air and outdoor life that largely defined her days in District 12. She has nothing to do but be prepped and primped for the camera, while both her mother and little sister have real work, useful work, to fill their days. So when the opportunity to join an actual fighting unit comes along, Katniss jumps at the chance.<br /><br />The final installment of The Hunger Games trilogy is just as fast-paced and easy a read as its predecessors. Given the plot-driven storyline and breakneck speed, it's not surprising that world-building details and character backgrounds are given a cursory nod and then left alone for the reader to make the best inferences possible. Not necessarily a bad thing in a YA novel, but somewhat frustrating for an older reader more accustomed to savoring those little background details and nuances of character. Rebel leader Coin was particularly cartoonish and flat, even when Plutarch, another one-dimensional character, took time to explain to Katniss the reason for Coin's animosity toward her. Katniss herself was, uponoccasion, so arbitrarily contrary that I wanted to smack her. She grows, though, much more in this novel than in the previous two, and by the end, I liked her again, and wished her peace and happiness on her chosen path.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Once upon a time in the not-too-near future, the United States lies in ruins, and in its place is Panem, with a glittering Capitol City at its center and 12 outlying districts supplying the City's needs. Life in the districts is hard, and nowhere is it harder than in District 12, where 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen lives with her widowed mother and little sister Prim.<br /><br />All Katniss wants to do is provide for her family, and so she hunts illegally in the forest outside the district fence. She works tirelessly and lives in fear each day of being caught and punished. But, more than being caught poaching, she fears being chosen for the Hunger Games, a mandatory annual competition in which 24 teenagers, one boy and one girl from each district, are selected to fight to the death on national television.<br /><br />Outwit, Outplay, Outlast, my Aunt Fanny: Survivor ain't got nothin' on the Hunger Games.<br /><br />When 12-year-old Prim's name is pulled from the box, however, Katniss volunteers to go as tribute in her place. She and the other tribute, baker's son Peeta, travel to Capitol City to take their place in the arena, and face what is likely certain death for both of them. Their mentor, Haymitch, the only winner District 12 has ever produced, has other ideas. And an unlikely strategy that just might give them an edge.<br /><br />But the rules state that there can be only one winner. Victory. Or death. Those are the only options. Because she's our heroine, we know going in that Katniss must come out the victor, but how she gets to the winner's circle is a harrowing, fretful journey indeed. And one entirely worth taking along with her.<br /><br />I started The Hunger Games on a Friday evening and finished it the next day by mid-afternoon. I can hardly wait to start the next book.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|This movie is extremely tiresome.  Very slow, very boring, and choppy.  The acting is fine but the story was not well told.  I got this for free at my local library but still feel like it cost me too much.  I would not recommend it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Some people are doomed from birth, it seems. Libby Day is one of those unfortunates. When she was seven, her family was murdered. Her teenaged brother was convicted of the crime based on Libby's testimony. And twenty-five years later, she's at the end of the money raised for her while she was that sweet-faced surviving tot, and earned from the book she published about the tragedy while she was in her 20s. With no education, no job skills, and no family except an aunt who won't return her phone calls, a brother serving a life sentence, and a deadbeat father -- whereabouts mostly unknown -- Libby faces the almost-certain probability of destitution and homelessness. Then a letter arrives in the mail, inviting her to appear at a convention of murder buffs and offering her $500 for the appearance.<br /><br />As it turns out, these murder buffs think her brother Ben is innocent. And Libby sees an opportunity to milk her tragedy for profit yet again, by making these pathetic fools pay her for finding and interviewing all the remaining players and reporting back any information she discovers. Not that she expects to find anything, or even make much money, for that matter. But when $500 is the difference between having a roof over her head and living in her car, she'll take what she can get.<br /><br />The story structure alternates between Libby's search in the present, and the events of that terrible day in January 1985 when her mother and sisters died. There isn't a single likeable person in this entire cast of characters: Ben Day is surly and not very bright; Michelle Day, the oldest sister, is nosy and selfish; Patty Day, their mother, is weak-willed; Libby herself was whiny and clingy as a child, self-absorbed and larcenous as an adult. But they -- especially Patty and Libby -- struggle so hard, and fight so desperately for their day-to-day survival, to find a piece of solid ground where they can stand tall and be safe.<br /><br />I know these people. I see them everyday in my work. And while I may dislike them on one level, I still love them on an entirely different level, a \\"there but for the grace of God\\" level. These are the denizens of the trash-strewn trailer parks and the ramshackle tumbledown farmhouses. This is the mother too proud for food stamps but terrified she can't feed her children. This is the teenage boy learning to be a man in today's world and lacking any positive role model to emulate. This is the young girl bounced from relative to relative because no one wants her to stay for long, but everyone refuses to let become a ward of the state because she's family and \\"we take care of our own.\\" They break my heart with their failure, their abject poverty, with being beaten down by a trick of circumstance and the consequence of poor choices.<br /><br />But in the end, I admire Libby. She had a tough row to hoe. She's a survivor. I hope she finds some happiness someday.
B003XWFLTM|5.0|Fantastic clarity throughout this set and all for only $4 per CD delivered.  The set is inexpensive, but certainly not cheap.<br /><br />I do like having all of a composers major works done by the same conductor and orchestra to get a consistent vision of the composer's works.<br /><br />This set is delivered in a \\"wallet style box with each CD in its' own paper sleve.  Accompanying the set is a 16 page pamplet on glossy paper.<br /><br />To sum up my impressions of this set in one word, it'd have to be \\"marvalous!\\"  It is the next best thing to being at the concert to see and hear the performances in person.
0451169514|4.0|In the summer of 1958, the small town of Derry, Maine, suffered one of its periodic outbreaks of murder and death, as it did every 27 years or so, as far back as such things were recorded. This summer was different, however. Because this summer, someone fought back.<br /><br />That summer, seven prepubescent children bonded together, seemingly by coincidence. Bill, Richie, Ben, Stan, Mike, Bev, and Eddie had virtually nothing in common except the bullies who harrassed them, and their personal experiences of the frightening oddities of Derry. These experiences led them to the conviction that something was hunting the children of Derry: that, in fact, this something, which they came to call IT, had killed Georgie, the younger brother of Bill, as well as several other children, and was trying to kill them as well. Out of this conviction came the inescapable conclusion that they had to kill IT first.<br /><br />And 27 years later, they have to do it again.<br /><br />The terror begins on page one, with the horrifying death of little Georgie Denbrough in the fall of 1957 and the equally vicious murder of a gay man in contemporary Derry. (As an aside, recalling that this book was written in the early 1980s when the AIDS scare was at its height and gay men blamed for all manner of societal ills, I'm proud of how King portrayed the police officer involved in the investigation of that murder. It would have been so easy -- and so in keeping with period -- to make him a stereotypical small town homophobe in uniform.)<br /><br />King then introduces his major characters through the simple device of a phone call from home with a reminder of their childhood promise to come back if IT ever reappeared. With one exception, none of the group remembers their childhoods or what happened that fateful summer. Only Mike had remained in Derry, and only Mike remembered. After the gay-bashing murder, Mike reluctantly concludes IT had returned and places his fateful phone calls. Prompted by that call, the others begin to regain their memories, in bits and pieces, each bit more horrifying than the last. And they pack their bags for the return.<br /><br />The remainder of the novel alternates between the story of the summer of 1958 and the children's first encounter with IT, and the adults' contemporary preparations for what they hope will be their last encounter. The flashback sequences drive the action of the contemporary story, but these flashbacks are the absolute heart of this novel: compelling, absorbing, gutwrenching, heartbreaking. King has a gift for getting inside the heads of children, adolescent boys in particular, and this gift serves him well indeed in IT.<br /><br />And as fantastic as the events of the story are, King makes the reader believe them, because the children believe them. IT embodies their every nightmare, their darkest secrets, their most secret insecurities; IT plucks their deepest fears from their minds and shows it to them in living breathing deadly Technicolor. And IT specializes in children. It's not an accident the most frightening face IT puts on is that of Pennywise the Clown, nor that the most terrifying object is a simple helium balloon on a string. \\"We float. Yes, we float. We all float down here...\\"<br /><br />You'll float, too, in this mad trip through the streets and alleys and sewers of Derry. And you'll be glad you did.

B003O86FMW|3.0|After their stunning Hunger Games double victory, Katniss and Peeta return home to District 12 and try to get back to their old lives. Being the victors, however, means their lives will never be their own again. As they are being prepared for the Victory Tour of all districts, Katniss is stunned to realize she must continue the pretense that she and Peeta are in love. But is it entirely pretense any longer? Katniss isn't certain.<br /><br />Rumors of rebellion, spurred by Katniss' dramatic public defiance of the Capitol's authority during the Games, leak out. Perhaps by coincidence, perhaps by design, the Capitol announces the names of this year's Hunger Games tributes will be drawn from each District's surviving victors. As the only female victor from District 12, Katniss knows she's going back to the Arena. The only question is, will Haymitch or Peeta be accompanying her? And which one of them will she need to kill to survive?<br /><br />The followup to The Hunger Games covers much of the same territory as its predecessor, but provides a somewhat deeper background for the world Katniss and her fellows inhabit. As Katniss and her victory entourage travel the Districts, I got a better sense of Panem's history: still no real details, but I could see some of the blank spaces starting to fill in. I was much more satisfied with this section of the book than when Katniss and her partner re-enter the arena. Really, one visit to the kill zone of the first book was plenty. And, although this arena had an entirely different -- and more intriguing -- setup, there's only so much slaughter this reader can take. Even if it is mostly \\"offscreen\\". And the novel's final twist felt contrived and arbitrary.<br /><br />While it's worth reading on the whole, I think Catching Fire suffers from \\"Middle Novel Syndrome\\", a failing shared by the second novel of most trilogies -- the story contains information necessary to set up the final novel, but the reader knows that final novel is where all the good stuff will finally happen. This is the chief reason why I haven't re-read The Lord of the Rings in many years. I love The Fellowship of the Ring but I just can't bear to slog my way through The Two Towers again to get to The Return of the King. It's a personal failing, that.e all the good stuff will finally happen. This is the chief reason why I haven't re-read The Lord of the Rings in many years. I love The Fellowship of the Ring but I just can't bear to slog my way through The Two Towers again to get to The Return of the King. It's a personal failing, that.

However, after reading all the great reviews and seeing that it's the same developers as Sprinkle which I rather enjoy I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />This is very different from Sprinkle so it's hard to compare but I must say I am enjoying this one much more. It's a very challenging game so it does not become boring. Some say it becomes repetitive but not true. Each board is different and new obstacles to overcome.<br /><br />The main objective is trying to get the apples before the thief does. Sounds simple enough but with all the obstacles it proofs to be very challenging.  Great for all ages.<br /><br />Highly recommend it!

1401938906|5.0|It takes guts to write a book like this. Imagine = I'm a Genie. Do you see that in the world? If you can imagine it you can have it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this series. Well written and edited. Very engaging story with plenty of twist and turns. This is up there with Ender's Game and Battlefield Earth.
B00BDSRISA|1.0|Phoenix. Another great band becomes a grotesquely mangled victim of \\"Loudness Wars.\\" This album was mastered so loudly that only the sparsely arranged tracks are really audible without turning the volume down 6db.<br /><br />Sit down and put on \\"United\\" or even \\"Wolfgang Amadeus,\\" listen to the first track and then put in \\"Bankrupt\\" and listen to the first track without changing the volume level--WARNING--your ears may bleed (that is if they're not already victims of the ear-bud de-generation). If you \\"can't hear the difference,\\" which I could hardly believe, and you have any sort of audio visualization tool (i.e. GarageBand) drag one of these songs in there (it will look like a brick) and then redo the audio test with this reference.<br /><br />The final product of this album though is the hands-down the worst master I have ever heard. The \\"Loudness Wars\\" must stop. Seriously Phoenix. If by some insane chance anyone near to you guys is reading this, please do not take this as me hating on you guys. I love you guys. Rather, this is plea. MUSIC IS DYNAMICS--both in terms of prosody and fidelity. I can't hear either on this album because of what the master did to your music. I want to support you guys but this album sounds worse than most stuff I have heard recorded in home studios on $150 mboxes set-ups. I am very discouraged with the music world these days. You guys made some unbelievable recordings in the past. Come on! What happened!?<br /><br />Peace/God bless.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|A very good movie. It has been a while since I last saw it, but I wanted it as part of my collection.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is the bomb it will be addicting when you start.  at the this then a are pop like ok
B009LDD22U|5.0|I have seen all of the shows & it is so much fun to watch. I've watched them at least 4 times already. ;)
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy this game and the visuals are well done on this game. Keeping the game fresh is a good way to keep flow going.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|We started watching this show just to have something new to watch. This show is Awsome & I've watched every season at least 4 times so far. It doesn't get old. This is So very funny.
B00FEN000S|3.0|Seems like people hate it or love it.  Neither feeling is appropriate.  This film is a mediocre project when taken as a whole.<br /><br />The effects are incredible.  The monsters and robots I can watch over and over for days.  Very cool.  The combat is reasonably exciting.  The Kaiju body parts and parasites harvested are very cool and gross.  So you should love this movie's effects.<br /><br />The acting was excellent.  Criticizing the actors is wrong, because they had literally nothing titillating to work with at times.  Much of the dialogue was absolute drivel.  Many of the \\"bonding\\" scenes between characters were a waste of our time--firstly because nobody cares about these people because we have not had any reason or time to bond with them; secondly, because they are so FORCED it is nauseating.<br /><br />This movie drops the ball on story and dialogue BIG TIME.  This is what deserves your hate.  Not the idea, which is very cool.  Not the acting.  Not the effects, which are perfect and amazing.  The lines are mind-numbing.  The scenes that are trying to FORCE US to care about relationships are tedious.  They wasted so many minutes on human interactions we do not care about!<br /><br />Either make the film longer and develop the characters--INCLUDING THE MYSTERIOUS ALIENS SENDING THESE MONSTERS!--Or just cut the crap and give us more monster mayhem and titanic battles.<br /><br />I liked seeing the mysterious beings from beyond, but not knowing anything significant about them is annoying.  That is another personal annoyance, by the way.  This is a sci-fi story.  Develop the aliens, please.<br /><br />So this film is NOT WORTH BUYING unless you love effects.  Don't make my mistake.  Just rent it.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|Love this show so sorry it's over... crushin' on Conor.  Nice to see him on the American version of Primeval. Why are BBC seasons so short??
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Very good movie that all men should see.  It takes courage to live your Christian faith,and this really shows that reality in a very good, entertaining, educational way.  I am so glad movies like Courageous are being filmed.

0345803485|5.0|I bought this because I was reading someone elses book and lost it.  Excellent read.  I could not put it down and was done in about two days
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I'm loving this book. Very compelling and entertaining, even for an older reader (I'm 30). I have already recommended it to friends.
0425266060|5.0|Love the books, but be warned, there are two more to this &#34;tilogy&#34;.  Great for all of you Fifty Shades fans.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Should be a required read for all university religion classes.  Enjoyed the historical documentation very much.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in religion or Middle East history.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Just got the game and so far so good made it through the first level and it was pretty easy once you figure it out good luck
B008Y212PI|3.0|Puzzles are relatively easy. Can do them and watch tv at the same time. There are hints if you get stuck. Definitely worth the play.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Though I have not seen it my grandson was very happy to see the trilogy. it was great entertainment for him while we watched football.
B00AQA0OJG|4.0|This is the first of the Sword Art Online figures I've picked up and I have to say it pretty nice. The sculpt is well done, the paint is clean, and she's quite well detailed overall.<br /><br />I do have one complaint which is the way you mount her sword into her hand in which you have to pull the hilt (handle) from the blade and re-attach it in her hand. When I did this the peg connecting the blade to the hilt broke, but I was able to fix it with some airplane model/hobby glue.<br /><br />Other than the poorly designed mounting system for the sword, the figure of Asuna Yuuki is still a great piece and would do well in any collection!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I kept hearing about these books and had no real plan to ever read them. Then a friend of mine gave me the first two to read. Was I ever surprised! Once you start you can hardly stop and, Anastasia and Christian won't get out of your head or heart. My friend couldn't give me book three for awhile since someone else was reading it. I tried to wait but had to get the ebook. I yearned to know what the ending would be and at the same time didn't want it to ever end. Now I'm done and feel lonely! All I can hope for is more books about A & C.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I'm surprised this movie hasn't received enough love. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen; I actually prefer this to Transformers. I saw it in South Africa while on a summer trip and it was so much FUN! However it seems it's not getting much attention in the US. I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to the sequel. Two thumbs UP!
B004FGA2LC|1.0|i went to watch this movie and it did  ot play only would do sound but no picture very un happy i havd email the seller and have yet to hear back not to happy about that either
B00EI6E17A|4.0|At first I hated this because, come on, &#34;Put your hands up, make them touch.&#34; It sounds like a Kindergarten class. &#62;.&#62;<br />But then the tune wouldn't leave my frickkin' head. And now I like the chorus. I don't know if I've grown or devolved.
1587143879|5.0|There is the best resource that I ever read about CISCO certification training. Thank you for the excellent book and resources... I hope with all of this resources get my certification the next year.<br /><br />1. Easy to read.<br />2. Explanations great.<br />3. Cheap.<br /><br />I recommend it a lot!
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Will was excellent in this. The movie is all an American movie can be. I loved it it. Witch is why it is in my libary
B0094CVO2S|4.0|good soundtrack, but i still think the original soundtrack is better. it is still good music to listen to :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Recommended to me by a friend.  Gripping story with lots of twists and turns.  I didn't want the book to end.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Absolutely!  Best bargain I've found in years.  You don't get the gobs of extras (except TS3 has a bonus disc) but you really don't expect all the extras.  You get the three films on BluRay and that is what we wanted all along anyway.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome  loved it the perfect ending to the shining.  Always wondered what happened to little Danny boy. Good ending.5 starsn
B001DHXT6G|5.0|what can I say? CLASSIC morality plays. The first interracial kiss on TV in the US. This series stretched people. Still discussed and loved after all these years. I think all children should be offered the opportunity to watch Star Trek series. There is just so much good PEOPLE interaction, regardless of what race the people are.
031262820X|4.0|Intersting in the usual vein of Madeleine Wickham. Not the best in my opinion but then I am addicted to her books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is an amazingly awesome super challenging game that will alwayss leave you geussing. I would say the best part was that it was free but that would be untrue the best part is the MINIONs!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Outstanding condition for a great price.  I would highly recommend this source for anyone looking to get quality for their money.
B0060QM09M|5.0|I  am not to comfortable with the medical procedures, so at first I had to think about the help and kindness Mr. Herriot was  giving the poor defenceless animals in cold miserable  weather conditions,at all hours of day and night  and often with  people who were not  willing to pay for the services  or just plain hard to deal  with.  When I  thought  about all of these aspects of the stories . The book  was not only entertaining but touched me so deeply .  I laughed until tears  came to my eyes  and  hated to see the book end. Just about the best book ever. Gladly give this book fives stars. Jo Groves
B00AFEXRME|3.0|It was ok. The movie was very slow in the beginning of the movie. I almost fell asleep on it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Ok, my smartphone will never be as good to read on as my Kindle HD 8.  But it is sure handy to have when I've got unexpected waiting time to kill.  Syncs well, easy to use.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Now this movie was my favorite. I loved this movie. I give it to thumbs up. This was great I loved all the action in it.
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|She is truly a unique artist with a very interesting and captivating sound.  Just wish this cd has more songs!
0061150142|5.0|I could not put this book down and when I had to all I could do is think about it. It was one of the best and rawest books I've ever come across. The emotion it evoked was so pure. My heart broke with each characters. It is a beautifully written story. Be prepared to weep.
B000002UY5|5.0|One of my kids borrowed my last CD (and can't get it back) and I liked the first one so I had to replace it!
B000HL0EEE|4.0|Even though I have never participated in one Star Trek convention, nor do I speak Klyngon, I am a big Star Trek fan!  Yes, I went to the fast food restaurant to buy the drinking glasses from the 2009 Star Trek movie with the new cast. Yes, I have watched every Star Trek show minus any cartoons! So-o-o-o .... of course I recommend Star Trek: Enterprise!
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|Not her best tour but well wort having.  Bonus footage was pretty standard.  Audio and video quality does not live up to blu-ray expectations.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Quirky romantic comedy mystery.  Keeps you guessing.  Gut wrenching emotion without being sappy.  You will never figure this one out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised.. If you have a smart tv already it's kind of redundant. No point.. But great if your tv doesn't have internet hook up. So far as I know the only things that cast are Netflix and Youtube.. I wish that it would cast ANYthing and EVERYthing I wanted it to. It works great so far. Bought for my parents who have a nice LG tv, but got their tv before wireless became standard in new tvs.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Very good product easy to set up. It all I expect it. I recommend to buy this monitor is wonderful
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game I got the first one and I just love the cute little om noms ....keep them coming I will definitely continue to play
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Was sold after Rick put the bullet through the little girl zombie's head. We knew we would love it and haven't missed an episode.<br />Waiting for season four to start next Sunday!
B002361MLA|4.0|The writing is very easy to read and takes a topic that may seem very complicated and makes it easy to understand. The book flows very well and is arranged in a question-answer format which put everything in a real world context.
B0013FSXSC|5.0|The movie was the first one I took my current girlfriend to. We both loved it. Great to have it on Blu-Ray.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it was one of the best games I ever played. and I hope you. like it as much as I do
B000Q66JXA|5.0|Again and all time favorite.<br />John Boorman's treatment of the Arthurian story is suberb.<br />Great cast and direction!<br />And such a great love story.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love the story line Has you not wanting to put book down to see what will happen next to the people in this story
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Love all three seasons. Can't wait for season four to begin!<br />I think season two is the best!<br />The dynamics between Rick, Shane and Lori are terrific.
B005VPRGB0|3.0|I expected this to be a much larger item, considering the cost. I think my grandson will like it, but I am disappointed.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I read these for the first time in my mid-30s and found them very fun and engaging. Their length was just right for a story before bed.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a wonderful story that CROSSES eighty years.  I love the way old and new, past and present mix.  Wonderful story.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun but don't like to buy when says it's a free game. Pretty easy to understand and use. Need more free games like this.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Love to read about life in Afghanistan. It is very sad for women under Taliban rule.  Also, the concept of polygamy or more to the point - Legalised rape - I hope one day that women can be fully liberated in these sick countries.
B007YO6MRA|5.0|Takes me back to when I was a teenager! Great music that I shared with my children and sharing with my grandchildren!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a master story teller.  I have now read his three books and none are a disappointment.  I'm looking forward to his next one. I love to learn about life in Afghanistan - very different to media.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Since his first two books are in my top 10 list, I was incredibly optimistic about this new novel from Daniel Suarez, and ended up purchasing both the Kindle book and the Audible audiobook.  Unfortunately, while it was good, it was nowhere near as good as Daemon and Freedom.<br /><br />Essentially, it's a similar near-term tech thriller.  Sci-Fi, but nothing which doesn't exist today, or at least nothing which couldn't exist today.  Unfortunately some of the tech in this is just silly, and some is basically trivial descriptions of current systems.  There were some potentially-interesting subplots, but they were basically ignored after being introduced.<br /><br />The characters, just like in Daemon and Freedom, weren't really the strong point -- kind of two dimensional, although not really cliche.  There were some glimmers of hope from secondary/minor characters.<br /><br />Ultimately, this would be a great summer blockbuster movie; great enough that people will clamor for a novelization of the movie based on a book...
B0099KJL70|5.0|Academy Award nominations: Screenplay based on Another Medium<br /><br />Wins: Picture, Director-Robert Wise, Supporting Actor-George Chakiris, Supporting Actress-Rita Moreno, Cinematography, Costume Design, Set Design, Film Editing, Sound, Scoring of a Picture and Screenplay based on Another Medium.<br /><br />March Boy nominations: Picture, Director-Robert Wise, Supporting Actress-Rita Moreno, Cinematography, Film Editing and Sound.<br /><br />Wins: Score.<br /><br />West Side Story is one of those films where so much has already been said concerning it’s merits and demerits, you wonder if there is anything left to add. Instead of rehashing the choreography or performances, I would like to talk about some of the little nuances here and there which help to make it the classic it is.<br /><br />There’s a very short scene on top of Maria’s apartment right before Chino bursts in to inform her of her brother’s death. She’s wearing a light undergarment and dancing in circles as though she’s floating through the clouds only to come crashing back to reality in a matter of minutes. This is symbolic of how we all build dream castles for our expectations in life, only to find out later on that they usually won’t come true.<br /><br />The picture of the Founding Fathers drafting the Declaration of Independence in the candy store above the table where the Sharks and Jets are fixing a date for the great battle to determine who owns the street. One of the most famous lines in the Declaration is “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.” And here these young men are, planning to fight to the death over a measly piece of land because of the color of their skin when all they have to do is look up to see the truth.<br /><br />The song “Gee Officer Krupke,” a biting satire on “Victimism” the philosophy which attributes the actions of the individual to his environment with no emphasis on the concept of free will. Politicians and activist groups--especially those concerned with racial tensions and gender roles--tend to promote victimism to create a sense of anger and injustice in their constituents as a ruse to gain support, regardless of whether the injustice exists or not. They encourage a host of vices in these people but do next to nothing to condemn them for it so long as their pockets are filled.<br /><br />You see, being a victim means you never have to say “I’m sorry.” Nope, it’s always someone else’s fault.<br /><br />It was the way you were raised. “My daddy beats my mommy, my mommy clobbers me. My grandpa is a commie, my grandma pushes tea. My sister wears a mustache, my brother wears a dress. Goodness gracious, that's why I'm a mess.”<br /><br />It was the neighborhood you grew up in. “Yes, Officer Krupke, he shouldn't be here. This boy don't need a couch, he needs a useful career. Society's played him a terrible trick. And sociologically he's sick.”<br /><br />It was the way you were created. “Right, Officer Krupke, you're really a square. This boy don't need a judge, he needs an analyst's care. It's just his neurosis that oughta be curbed. He's psychologically disturbed.”<br /><br />SOMEBODY ELSE needs to pay.<br /><br />When you combine an entitlement mentality that recoils from hard work and traditional values with a life in the slums of a big city, you’re bound to get what you have in West Side Story. Riff, Ice and their cohorts are the product of the culture, the lazy punks who live according to the inconstant change of their pursuits and pleasures regardless of the consequences thereof.<br /><br />Anybody the Tomboy. She doesn’t get talked about very often but her drive and ambition to join the Jets makes her a very compelling character. Riff dismisses her as a wannabe but Ice sees potential in her. When he becomes the new leader, she tells him Chino is after Tony with a gun and he decides she has earned her keep. However, she finds out too late in the climatic scene at the candy store with Anita that being a member of the Jets isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. She gladly joins in the jeering “Bernardo’s tramp wants to help” but then suddenly realizes they mean far worse for Anita than a few mere insults. The look on her face as the doctor kicks them out says it all; she will ask herself for the rest of her life what she saw in these lowlifes she wanted so badly to belong to.<br /><br />Now look around. How many people do you know who are just like that? Granted most don’t go as far as Anybody to gain acceptance but all of us desire some sort of intimacy--a lover, friend, family or group--to make us feel complete. People do what WORKS FOR THEM. There is nothing essentially wrong with the desire in itself; it’s when you’re willing to do anything to fulfill it at the expensive of your morals that it becomes a problem. Anybody tried a gang and it worked for her...for a little while.<br /><br />Baby John, the youngest and most innocent of the Jets. He is not wicked or bloodthirsty by nature; he simply desires some form of relationship for fulfillment. Like Anybody, he is attracted to the Jets because of their moxie, only to find out later on who he is really buttering up to. When Arab hunts him down after the battle, he is not only crying for Riff, he’s crying for Bernardo, the LEADER OF THE ENEMY. “Did you see those knives? Did you see the looks on their faces? I never thought it would come to that.” When the Jets try to take advantage of Anita, he doesn’t join them. He won’t even add to the jeering. He tries to run out of building and then they FORCE him to take part. At the end, he even helps Maria with her shawl as a gentlemanly gesture to a grieving party. Even though Baby John will probably go to jail with the rest of the gang, I think he is the only one who truly had a change of heart.<br /><br />Five Stars.omes the new leader, she tells him Chino is after Tony with a gun and he decides she has earned her keep.

B009RX7WTI|5.0|One of the best seasons ever! Love every episode. A must have if you are a collector or fan of the show.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|For a quick, easily accessible update on the weather this app. fulfilled  it's goal. When time is the most important factor, this app. Is the way to go!!
B00AMPY54U|5.0|Anything by Herb is great. This is one of his best! Bought this record in Vinyl when it came out in 1982 and it's even better in CD
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Keeps me entertained for hours! One thing that needs to be fixed is how easy it is to accidentally expand ponyville using gems if you tap something really fast. But the rest of the gameplay is pretty fun.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Great purchase!  Needed an extra paper copy at home for son's summer reading assignment.  Book was in good condition and served the purpose.
B00FFVML74|5.0|Broadchurch grabs you from the opening scene and keeps you on the edge of your seat through all eight episodes. The characters get well developed which is not always the norm for TV. The story and characters are interwoven. You will not see how they are all finally connected until the last few minutes of the last episode.<br />As a mystery aficianado, I usually guess \\"who done it\\" well before the end, but I was guessing and wrongly, over and over again throughout the series. The ending was shocking while still being truthful to the overall narrative.<br />The story was well written and the characters spoke like they were in real life. The actors deserve high praise for drawing us into the world of Broadchurch immediately.<br />David Tennant threw off the mantle of Dr. Who easily with his first scene, proving once again that he is talented and worth watching in anything. All the other actors were superb. Each one from DS Miller down to the town drunk were spot on and worked together as an ensemble.<br />WATCH THIS SHOW! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I picked this book in a hurry, thinking in the beginning I had made a mistake; what a pleasant surprise. I stuck with what I originally thought was a book for women - what ever gender it was intended for I enjoyed it immensely. The characters where captivating and personable; I cared for them all. Liane weaved humor into a believable well written story. Thank you. Maybe I give up zombie books for good!!
B0074JODP8|5.0|Very high quality.  Very nice show.  Really like Joe's playing and song selection.  Next best thing to actually being there.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love it, this is very entertaining and well thought, more updates pleases and more games. Thank you Zeptolab... keep up the good work
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Boring very bad movie.  Made it about 30 minutes and had to shut it off.  The Stallone movie was better which is really saying something.
B00EHMG358|4.0|I am not an avid Preston & Child reader.  The last book of either of theirs I read was RIPTIDE.  But the premise of this was too much to ignore.  The first preview chapter alone is worth the wait.  An interesting premise (man-eating bear?), unique setting (wealthy Colorado skiing town), and suspenseful insinuation (was it really a bear?  And who wants to keep that a secret.  Great thriller material and pulled off well in these first 9 chapters.  I'll be reading the entire thing when it comes out.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|When the movie was finished and I walked out of the theater, I was still holding my breath.  It took me some time to begin breathing normally, and for the next several hours I reflected on this incredible thrill-ride.<br /><br />The effects are staggering.  The views are mesmerizing.  The soundtrack is grand.  But Ms. Bullock's acting is what really makes this film the ride of the century.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock's emotions come through in a way that brings me close to her.  I feel her fear, her anguish, her hopelessness. It's her acting talent that brings me into the story and gives me a part in the film.<br /><br />Yes, the special effects tell a compelling story, as does the soundtrack.  But Ms. Bullock's acting puts this film over the top.  It is clearly the best movie this year; and for this genre, it's certainly the best ever.<br /><br />Screenplay, cinematography, acting, and soundtrack are all absolutely first rate.<br /><br />I watched it in 3D.  For most films, I think 3D detracts (and distracts) from the story - but this film is better for being in 3D.  I also think that the experience in the theater is well worth it.<br /><br />See it.  And for once, I say see it in 3D.
B007SGM084|3.0|First book is good, second ok, third dragged. I too find the dialog in all three books to be a disappointment. The story is weak & could have been written with so much more detail! The movie, I'm afraid, will be much of the same.

B000I186FW|3.0|This could have been a good anti-socialism tool.  However, Christianity was vilified along with socialism.  The Christian faith was linked to murdering homosexuals.  Also, those found in possession of the Koran were also murdered.  The bad outweighs the good really.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This movie could be literally named X-Zombie-X(Insert your word for X). But they chose the title of the most awesome book about humanity vs zombie which talks about how the humans fought against their undead foe. The title is so misleading that when you see the movie you feel totally let down. Total piece of trash.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story was incredibly woven. I couldn't put it down. While it was sad and difficult at times, I am 100% satisfied reader. The book has many different messages that I think any person could relate to at least one of them. Seriously, read this book.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This is a good book once the characters are introduced.  Kinda started out slow for me but once i got into it, it was very well developed and became difficult to put down.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|A fun matching game.  Works fine on mine on my Kindle Fire HD. Got it as free app of the day. :)
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game keep my pre-school granddaughter entertained for long periods of time.  Once shown what/how to do each step she was off and designing and loves it. I also got her the fairy salon.  My daughter and I have also gotten sucked into it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great. I'm totally hooked. Very enjoyable game and stress free. Just build and go, you don't have time constraints like other games which I prefer. So I recommend this game highly.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Excellent follow up to the first book.  It is an enjoyable story and sets up the third book perfectly.  Smooth reading. Well done.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great. I love all the diary of a wimpy kid books! Jeff Kinney never ceases to write a fun read cant wait for number eight!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book has been out for what seems like ages and I just finally read it.  I have not yet read the sequels and was excited to see the movie is coming out soon.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Love this series. Always a winner. Great gift idea too. Ordered this along with the 2nd series and they both came together on time.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|The first two were so so good and this one takes a different twist in the development of characters and so much happens so fast it almost seems like several of the sub plots could have been better developed to extend the story and still come to the same conclusion.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast only have 3 options to watch streaming videos, Netflix, Youtube and Google Movies. I gave it a 4 star so if they have more options.. I would give 5 star.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Not exactly sure how i feel about this game. I liked the jewel puzzles but i haven't figured out the point of the game...to build up a tree city?
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|I bought this book a long time ago, and I need to get my money's worth, so I am reading it. Several major points come up immediately:<br /><br />1. \\"Who cares?\\" People in lots of different places believe a lot of different things. Chinese people believed that China was the center of the flat world until about 1979 (they had their first emperor in the third century BC) and that all humans were subjects of the Chinese sovereign (until most of the Qing Dynasty was over). So, someone somewhere believing something foolish is neither a rarity nor a miracle.<br /><br />2. \\"If everyone stopped believing in God tomorrow, then what?\\" A neologism is in order here. Atheist-utopianism? Will every good thing happen, or will human beings still be animals with limited intellectual capacity (some more limited than others)?<br /><br />3. \\"I think your causality is confused.\\" Religion does not exist independently of human beings. Dawkins keeps writing about it as if it does. It doesn't. Is he upset at something that has no independent existence (religion) or should he direct his anger toward the sub-optimally designed human brain?<br /><br />4. \\"Who are you talking to?\\" This book is written in English. Not Urdu. Not Arabic. Not Hausa. And even if it was, the literacy rate in the place where people speak those languages is about 50% (Pakistan. Middle East. Nigeria.) So who is going to read this? I think the number of books that are translated into Arabic every year is in the low hundreds. What is the chance that anyone (that needs to read this) is going to: i) see this; ii) be able to read it; iii) be convinced; iv) make a life change? And if he is talking to American/ European people: The church died long ago in Western Europe. It's been neutered in the States for a long time.<br /><br />5. Continuation of Question 1....\\"Why is this so important to you?\\" Out of all the things in the world that are \\"wrong\\" (and that you can't do anything about) or that you could do something about (educating people about Biology), why the obsessive interest in this? (He has written as much about atheism as Biology-- and he is trained as a Biologist and not a philosopher.)<br /><br />There is a lot here. The book is in 10 chapters and works out to about 45 pages per chapter, and so I'll just abstract the most germane points from each chapter.<br /><br />Chapter 1. Dawkins defines and distinguishes between deists, theists, and pantheists in terms of the way that they use words like \\"God\\" and \\"religion.\\" He also (in so many words) lays out his epistemic foundations (Materialism). There is an interesting discussion about how defining something as \\"offensive to someone's religion\\" is a way to put it off limits. He goes briefly over several incidents of manufactured violence (courtesy of Islam).<br /><br />Chapter 2. This is an unfocused chapter. He keeps up with taking slaps at the church/ Abrahamic religions and goes on about some logical inconsistencies in this or that doctrine.  One thing he notes is that churches are tax-exempt. But then so are universities and they destroy orders of magnitude more value than churches. Can we get some perspective here? The chapter moves on to some discussion about the United States (a country in which he doesn't live and has no boots on the ground) to speculations about what the Founding Fathers *could have thought* about religion. It also seems (according to Dawkins) that there is rabid religious fanaticism in the United States. Then we switch pace yet again to taking on agnostics (what was this chapter about, anyway?)  It's impossible to accept \\"Non overlapping magisteria\\" (science and religion are two different things).<br /><br />Chapter 3. He's on about the problems in various \\"proofs\\" of God (and of course what's wrong with them). Ontological arguments. Teleological arguments. Bayesian arguments. A bit of speculation on extraterrestrial life thrown in for good measure (done by Michael Shermer in [[ASIN:1250008808 The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths]]). All of these have been done before-- many times.<br /><br />Chapter 4. His argument about why there is very likely no God. Recapitulates a lot of what he has said in [[ASIN:0393315703 The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design]]<br /><br />The rabbinate has existed for the last 2,000 years and it will exist long after this author's name is forgotten. And the ulema. And the Christian clergy. Dawkins is screaming at the wind. But then, I guess everyone has to have some reason to sell books and get interviews. If you are an undergraduate going through the \\"angry phase,\\" then this reading is for you. But if you are a person with a wife and kids to take care of or a full life, then the time that you spend on this book will be time that you can't get back. If you have already been through that phase (the angry/ militant atheist phase) and have arrived at a sense of withdrawal (like the present writer), then none of these lines of reasoning will be unfamiliar.<br /><br />How could this book have been made better?<br /><br />1. Tighter organization. It feels like this book is a series of essays/ lines of reasoning that he'd had years ago and couldn't get quite into a book. And there just came one day when he could mash together enough to make a book (with minor revisions).<br /><br />2. Better table of contents.<br /><br />Verdict: Conditional recommendation.ng Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths]]).

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham never fails to deliver. I have read most of his books and this is one of the better ones. The plot moves along nicely and I have to say that I didn't figure it out until nearly the end. Fine job Mr. Grisham,I look forward to your next book.
0061928356|2.0|i'd sum up this book as: jodi picoult does india. or maybe that's insulting jodi picoult b/c she usually she's got a one-two punch of plot twist at the end to go along with her mediocre writing. this book didn't finish with a bang like that.<br /><br />my biggest complaint lies in the author's or editor's error of reporting that there are 950 girls born for every 1000 boys to back-up a character's comment that women are a minority in india. big deal. that rate is actually the natural birth rate as reported in a 2002 study, plus it's a much better rate than india's current rate (2011) of 914 girls per 1000 boys. and this wasn't the only spot where the editor failed
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; which was the closing movie after FOX stupidly canceled &#34;Firefly.&#34; So enjoy all the episodes of &#34;Firefly&#34; in order and then watch &#34;Serenity.&#34; FOX is eating crow when they canceled this show and they know it. There is an immense cult following for the show even though it lasted only one season. Catch a good time with &#34;Firefly&#34; characters at any Comicon.
B001XJEKGC|4.0|It was good not great. Sound and picture was clear just not the best performance not the usual excitement of most of Clapton cds
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is very fun detailed and not to easy but not to hard<br />just get the game and you will see.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Good read. . Good flow and plot. If you are a Percy and Anabeth fan you will love this book
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|Actually i am not a N.I.N. fan but my wife is so she kindly ordered me to buy their new album for her. I quote her review: &#34;I really love the latest work of N.I.N., -there is a comment about Trent Reznor which i am not willing to quote-, it is a great LP, still i am disappointed by the poor packaging of the CD included. It was placed inside the LP box on a simple paper bag. Anyway, it is NIN so i forgive them&#34;.
B000244FDW|5.0|This DVD was full of new scenes that I never saw in my old VHS tape.  Extra scenes made it easier to follow. Quite pleasing!
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome great the best multiplayer and more best thing ever!!!! thank u Notch and Mojang you created the best game ever
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a fun game for problem solving and even memory.  You need to remember where you saw items and figure out how to get them. The puzzles are engaging.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I enjoyed the story.  Needs more proofreading.  Why didn't anyone deal with the little girl's abuse?  She needs serious intervention.  Main characters \\"love story\\" has a bunch of holes to fill.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love these puzzles...if you like nonograms, you should try this app. I like that it has a hint button.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game. I especially like the 5 free games daily. It's a great time waster at doctors etc.  The only compliant I have is the pay outs on bongos are small for the cost of cards.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Apocalypse zombie film with a few twists.  The movie does keep you on the edge of your seat, but come on..really?  I can't believe I watched another zombie movie in 2013.  it is amazing this genre gets any play anymore.  Oh well... This is kind of g rated version of Romeros land of the dead.  Good points were that it wasn't as macabre and also has a good ending.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|I don't normally do these reviews, but I feel I must for this one. This is basically the same game as the console versions, only without quite as many missions and tracks. At the current price tag ($1.73), this is a steal. If you enjoy the console version, or like any mario kart-type games, then do yourself a favor and buy this. You will not be disappointed. Just switch the controls to the slider as opposed to tilt(unless that's your thing) because tilt is just awful for this type of game. Have not experienced any ads or in-app purchases at all, this is legit!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really love this book,it brakes down  the meanings and helps you to understand every thing for you. I love every thing about it and I would recommend it to everyone.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|The author has dealt with a sensitive issue in a unique way. The plot line was engaging from start to finish.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game. Nice to have choices for the puzzle size. It is nice to have a bonus level at the end of the game.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|We decided to start a book club. All of us bought this book. Some of us just thought it was bad but not that bad -- just a disappointment after the hype of all the great reviews. Others hated this book with a deep, seething passion. People were so annoyed by this book that our book club disbanded before the first meeting, even though everyone had read the book!
B0094LYBT2|5.0|Very moving with great acting! Alex Kendrick is a good writer. We have another inspirational video from a book that he authored.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't get on the &#34;Hunger Games wagon&#34; when it first came out. After I read book 1, I was hooked. All books in the trilogy are well written and kept me turning the pages.
B00FITRTQ6|4.0|Purchased on Amazon.it<br /><br />I liked this story because sometimes it reminded me Agatha Christie's novels and I love them.<br />I liked also the scene of the crime, a big house where a lot of people may be the killer.<br />So I think who likes detective stories have to read this book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun deserves 5 stars. i play this more than all temple run and angry birds combined. so fun
B0012TWRAO|5.0|comes with 2 different size u-bolts and a plastic sleeve insert to protect your bike. Very easy to install and silly strong. The rubber caps used to protect the bolts from the elements don't fit but I really don't care. Good stuff
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is my first review ever on here. I LOVED this game. It's strategic without being overly difficult. Perfect for me. Thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend. 2D BOY where's another??!!
B00EDF43MY|4.0|My daughter really loves this app. She loves all the Dr. Pandas, but this one and the daycare are her real favorites.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have been a jigsaw fan for many years. This so is really easy to use. You don't need a big space to do it. I highly recommend it.<br />dprushton@frontiernet.net
B00ECUARO8|3.0|What can I say?  I love McConaughey.  He has made better movies, but how can you go wrong looking at MM?  Until he does something really bad, I will continue to support all of his movies.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Good flick. Stands the test of time.  Funny and a bit on the dark side. Good addition to a hallween collection.
030796664X|4.0|Provided many days of enjoyable and insightful listening while traveling to and from work.  Have lent to others to enjoy as well.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever downloaded!! You build your own city and all that you should get this game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent book.  Kind of a sad ending though. Anybody who saw the Hunger games but haven't read the books should take the time.
B00CUKTG2Q|4.0|More of the same music as expected, overall, satisfied with the new album. If you like this album, I recommend all their previous albums.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Much better than stock alarm clocks in these phones works great definitely uh easier for me to get up in the morning and it doesn't bother my wife next to me Thanks for a super app!
1439152810|5.0|This was a book selected for my book club and I LOVED it.<br />If anyone says they didn't love it, then I'd bet they didn't finish reading it. It has twists that<br />I didn't see coming.<br /><br />Reading it a second time was just as exciting, as so many things came to light.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I bought this for Wagon Wheel but the rest of the songs are great too! Darius does a great job, especially putting the Robinsons in the Wagon Wheel video.
B00BMKH5NW|3.0|A previous book by Rainbow Rowell blew me away -- [[ASIN:B008SAZHLQ Eleanor & Park]]. E&P proved to be intelligent and funny, and the story felt fully fleshed out.<br /><br />Fangirl? 2 out of 3 aint bad. Intelligent and funny are still on display, but the book seemed to be about a lot of things that almost happened, or were almost dramatic. Tons of promise of interesting events that never panned out. (Alienation from a twin, catastrophe due to father being bipolar, twin or self with mental illness, maternal abandonment, growing as a writer, accusations/repercussions from perceived plagiarism.)<br /><br />But there's a lot of good here. Anyone who's enjoyed fanfic will relate to Cath as a dedicated writer of Slash/HoYay! One of the questions raised by the author concerned whether or not Cath might be shortchanging her skills by playing in another author's world. I'm not sure an answer was reached.<br /><br />Cath's love interest, Levi, seemed to be a cool guy, appreciative of everything that made Cath unique.<br /><br />I'd list Rainbow Rowell is one of the better YA/NA authors out there, but the prime example of this remains Eleanor and Park. Still, this book was worth my time, and very well might be worth yours!
0345803485|1.0|I listened to all of the hype, the roll outs on the Today Show etc.  What a gargantuan waste of time, money and aspirin.  This book was obviously written by a nun who has never even seen a man much less had any kind of sex.  There is NO PLOT whatsoever, the characters are completely unbelievable, the geography is so screwed up that I'm sure Canada is about to claim the state of Washington as it's own.  Who does this \\"author\\" think she/he is?  This is a true waste of paper.  There is no way that anyone could climax as often as Ana does nor is there a man alive who can perform time after time after time without a respite, I don't care how much Viagara he takes.  This whole thing is just completely not worth even picking up, and there is going to be a movie made of this, REALLY.....
B0089LOG02|5.0|I just wanted to keep reading this and learning what happened next to Vivian. Wish there was a sequel so I could find out more.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|first of all you might know me from other reviews of apps I go by the name sugar cookie an this game is truely funny it might be slow an dumb but it makes you laugh I don't believe in bad apps wait yes I do I am a game criteck so I need I thumbs up game not trying to be the bad guy here but. at least try the app anyways u might know me from other reviews such as mermaids make over rabbids invasion an my virtual pet so check the reviews.out peoples!!!???!!!!????!!!!
B009RX85N0|4.0|worth the watch, you will get hooked on the entire season.  You will then need to by the 3rd season
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Flows from chapter to chapter like smooth wine.  From book to book, I could not keep my thoughts off of Katniss and her quest.  Can't wait for the next movie.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|Handsome case, very sleek, works great with the phone. The black on red looks smart and sporty. Protects the phone nicely, though I will not be throwing out of a second story window to test it. The case is not impervious to water nor military rated for high speed impacts; that's why I like it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does everything it says it will do...for a free alarm anyway. I haven't had any problems with it so far and I use it almost everyday.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the auto tag feature makes it very difficult to use facebook.. when I'm trying to update my status,  comment on a post or picture the apps auto tag feature tags people on my friends list. this makes it very frustrating to use..
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works great...I'm glad I picked it up...the music is mellow and I like the features... a great buy If your looking for an alarm clock
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Works well on the Kindle. Great interface and I have no complaints.The text is just the right size, not too big and not too small.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|I love this series.  Normally, I would rate Downton five stars, but this season was such a downer.  I won't go in to spoilers, but I definitely enjoyed season 1 and 2 more.<br /><br />The Blu-ray itself was great quality, and I always enjoy the behind the scenes features of Downton Abbey.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|What's to say about a season's worth of a TV series?  If you enjoy the show and want to rewatch it, or missed some of the shows, this is a good way to do it.  I've also introduced friends & family to the show via the series DVD's.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is moving and very thought provoking.  It makes you wonder just how many lives have traveled these same journeys.  I was touched by the success of the lives of these poor children and the trials they had to encounter.  I will recommend to my friends.  Great praise to the author.
1592402038|3.0|Eats, Shoots & Leaves was surprisingly entertaining. I am not a grammar snob and I never have been concerned with it. I don't even know if I punctuated this sentence correctly. However, there was never a dull moment with this book. I enjoyed the wit she pared with genuine knowledge of her subject. After reading this book I wanted to know more about the comma that caused all out brawls. I felt the emotion from the author and her passion for grammar. Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys educated humor.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|The title is somewhat tongue in cheek given how the movie goes. I liked how the story line developed more of who Tony Stark is/is becoming over just him in the suit blowing stuff up (although there is plenty of that!). I like stories that have the blow'em up stuff with plot that makes the characters believable. This one is a good blend of the two.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more of the development of the Mandarin's character, though. It was a little anticlimactic when his Tony finally caught up to him.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is so fun. It's a challenge but lots of fun too. You'll never get bored. High score of 2934 :D I like this game a lot. The Music is catchy also.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I like the movie. Will watch it again. The plot was okay and the scenery was okay. It had an interesting ending. And there was plenty of action.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is very helpful and<br /> accurate. Best weather app I have used by far! other weather app 's haven't been as accurate or as easy to operate.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Bought to complete my collection was as good as the first movie but Its still watchable.  Lots of action Would still recommend to everyone
B009AY04A8|3.0|The &#34;discussion&#34; between the characters goes on WAY too long.  Will play until the end, and then delete game from my Kindle.
B005LAII3A|5.0|Enjoyed the movie lots of action and it had a good plot. would recommend the movie for anyones collection. Try it you will like it
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very addictive for freaks like me.<br />Hours.<br /><br />Please provide configuration settings for :<br />  ① contrast/color,<br />  ② scaling, resolution<br />  ③ rotation/orientation<br />  ④<br /><br />It would be helpful for the colour blind if greens, reds and browns weren't interspersed  so closely on the grid.  Perhaps, one setting could use high contrast color border like  3d layers with drop shadows.  Also, make the &quot;✘&quot; have a dark border especially over the numbers.  It could be useful for those numbers to be magnified in a pop-up balloon with that &quot;✘✖&times;x&quot; more transparent while a grid cell is highlighted.<br /><br />Allow scaling to be retained after restarting a puzzle.  Make it an option for default scaling to be &quot;fit screen&quot; regardless of device resolution.<br /><br />Some of these puzzles are extremely difficult because the bitmap is too sparse as opposed to others which are both dense and contain a handful of long stretched lines instead of only scattered dots.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it kept me interested until the end.  I could have felt a little more connected to the characters, but all in all a good read.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|5 stars because it is easily their best album since Favourite Worst Nightmare. Turner's lyrics are brilliant, and the awesomeness never dies down.
1401938906|5.0|Good to know that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. Haven't read the whole book, but experiment 1 worked for me right away. Gave me a good chuckle as well!
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Previous reviews stated they were surprised when they received their &#34;5pack.&#34; It used to be that they would send a 3 pack and 2 packs free floating and not packaged in a box.  Now they have created an actual pack of 5.  The quality of the pictures look great.  Everyone looks flawless and they develop fast.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|I at first was able to take videos and photos but then it started saying camera error and that it couldn't connect to the camera I don't know if it is my kindle but it upsets me... :(

B004UID2LC|4.0|I can download any video. It'll sometimes take long time but it downloads even if you put your kindle to sleep. I honestly like this app.
B00BYKIKJS|2.0|It was boring to me and after all Bradley is &#34; the sexiest man alive per ***** some magazine (can I get in trouble for saying what magazine...) ????? Actually I watched it because of Robert D.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS REALLY FUN BECAUSE IT HAS CREEPERS THAT EXPLODES AND SKELETONS THAT SHOOTS ARROWS AND ZOMBIES AND SPIDERS AND EVERYTHING IS BLOCK'S...................... IT IS FUNN
0345525558|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It is a beautifully written novel with a plot unlike any other I have read before now. I love not only how the story developed before me, but was also intrigued by the meanings and origins of the flowers that played an integral part in the story as well. I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a good book! :)
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|If you just sit back and let this movie happen to you, it might just be a thrilling experience. Putting the viewer behind the movie camera is an instant \\"in\\" for the movie audience, causing intimacy and involvement. I feel like I just spent 80 minutes stumbling through Manhattan with a handful of other people, while a mammoth creature was destroying the city. And since it was all make-believe, I'm relieved that it's over and that I'm alive and well.<br /><br />You need to enter into the 'found footage' monster movie \\"Cloverfield\\" knowing that one or more of the characters might make stupid and rash decisions. When Rob finds himself and his buddies in the midst of a colossal disaster during a party, his first and only thought is of Beth, his love, whom he needs to find. Without this noble quest, we might not have such a gripping film. And it is gripping, and engaging. Once the thrills begin, it's just a fun ride .... harrowing, sure, but a real dose of escapism that makes for a good night at the movies. J.J. Abrams (who was involved in \\"Lost\\", \\"Super 8\\", the latest \\"Star Trek\\" movies, and more) wanted to give America something similar to Godzilla, and this is definitely effective.<br /><br />Steer clear of this flick if the shaky, handheld camera movies like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" make you queasy. \\"Cloverfield\\" will have the same effect, particularly when our intrepid heroes have to ascend a building's staircase to its roof and then cross over to the next apartment building that is leaning against it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think this third book is my favorite. I really enjoy it. I read the reviews on it. And the complaints about I think are way to harsh. Yes there is lots is sex for Christ sakes its Gideon & Eva. Of course there's going to be sex & lots of it. Ease up people. When the fourth comes on I will be purchasing it. I have to. And you will too!  Good book,Sylvia Day.

B000EF5NAS|4.0|This story, albeit simple and predictable, grows richer as the years pass. I liked the film a lot when it first came out in the 1980s. Over the last 20 plus years I may have watched it again about four times. Each time I see something deeper and more humane about this story of two women who are deeply devoted to each other. Now I've heard many references to the &#34;underlying&#34; lesbian theme between the two female protagonists.......and to that  notion I quote the judge in the film's murder trial, &#34;I don't really give a good god-damn.&#34; If people need to paint it with that brush, so they must. But what I see, and perhaps it's the years of life behind me that allows a certain retrospect,  is unconditional love and commitment between two women who have few choices given the time in which they live and who use that friendship and love to build something better than themselves. And that is what I think most of us are hoping to discover on this brief journey we call life.
B00594XOZU|4.0|It is really cool that I can text my friends but every word that it doesn't know it changes the word into something that I don't want! Also if someone that you are texting any they don't have Wi-Fi it doesn't go through to the other person but other than that it is VERY good

B00A376YAK|5.0|This book is remarkable.  It goes deep into Ruby internals.  The way it explains the Ruby Object Model is truly revealing.  My understanding of Metaprogramming was solidified only after reading this book.  I highly recommend it not only for Metaprogramming in Ruby, but also to get deep insight into how Ruby works - The Ruby Object Model, Ruby's Openness and Flexibility.  Before attempting DSL in Ruby, read this book to get full command and mastery !

020530902X|5.0|This book is a must for those who wish to improve their writing. It was the required reading for my English composition class. I still continue to reference it.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Well, I didn't realise Jobs was such a nutter, or Gates for that matter.<br /><br />In fact, I didn't realise the two had worked so closely together over the years.<br /><br />So yeah, there's fascinating stuff in here, and I enjoyed the history of Apple more than that of Jobs himself, who I think - despite the author's best attempt to avoid portraying him one way or the other - just comes across as a fairly unlikeable man who either had some psychological dysfunction or was just a turd. Still, he was pretty good at making stuff, and it seems that he was really just starting to get to the most interesting part of his life when his illness finally got the better of him. Shame for him, and shame for us, as it did seem (unlike Elvis or Jesus) he might have had his best ideas still to come. We'll never know.<br /><br />So, yeah, Isaacson's book is going to remain the definitive bio of Jobs for some time, not least because of his privileged access. There's info here you can't get from any other source. And while it is mostly an easy page-turning read, it's frustrating at times because the author simply refuses to engage in any kind of analysis or explanation of Jobs' character, merely chronicling what he did with little comment.<br /><br />The book isn't a sycophantic as I'd been led to believe, and I think Isaacson should be largely exempt from criticisms about objectivity, but really what I want from a bio is to have the author's interpretation of what drove the subject, why and how they turned out like they did, and why they did what they did. On those criteria, I'd say this book is largely a fail; by the end, I didn't really feel like I &#34;knew&#34; Jobs; I didn't really get a sense of why Jobs was Jobs. What I got was a clear picture of what had actually happened in his lifetime, but a good biography should do more than just chronicle events. It should say something about them, too.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? First, because it's still a decent read, and second because if you're interested in either Jobs or Apple, then you really will have to read this book for the factual info. Of course, if you don't care about either, you're probably reading reviews for another book anyway...
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Recommended for the curious.  The DPRK is where Alice would feel like she was back in Wonderland.  Read this book! 👍

B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book turned out very differently to what I expected. It was very easy to read with simple language and uncomplicated themes.<br /><br />It began with an older man dissatisfied with the direction that his and his wife's lives were taking. There were no more communications or common goals. They may have well been living separately and were most likely staying together for appearances sake, being of that age.<br /><br />Harold receives a letter, and probably an epiphany. He starts walking without any preparation and does not stop until he reaches his goal some 600 miles on. As he travels we learn more of his background and it is truly tragic. This is not the light hearted novel that it first appears to be.<br /><br />Fortunately it is not all doom and gloom in the end and there is some light at the end of the tunnel, although it is definitely not a happy novel.

B00BEIYP1W|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Ron Howard's \\"Rush\\" relates the true-life tale of two Formula One racecar drivers - Britain's James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda - whose intense rivalry helped to define the sport in the 1970s.<br /><br />As befits a pair of arch competitors, Hunt and Lauda were polar opposites in any number of ways. Hunt, the \\"bad boy,\\" was a hard-drinking, hard-living international playboy-type with a crappy marriage - his supermodel wife (Olivia Wilde) was having an affair with no less a figure than Richard Burton - while Lauda, the \\"good-boy,\\" was a work-obsessed, early-to-bed homebody with a terrific marriage to a beautiful and devoted woman (Alexandra Marlena Lara). Hunt was also devilishly handsome and sexy, a fact which garnered him a bevy of overeager groupies and celebrity status, while Lauda, with his self-described \\"rat face,\\" barely registered as a blip on the cultural scene. The movie chronicles their relationship - defined by incidents of high drama and near-tragedy - both on and off the track, with each developing a grudging admiration for the other's doggedness, tenacity and undeniable devotion to the sport over time.<br /><br />The movie has a number of things going for it. The screenplay by Peter Morgan doesn't dumb down the characters or over-dramatize the conflict between them. In addition, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent as Hunt and Lauda, underplaying rather than grandstanding their way through their roles. And, of course, it goes without saying that the racing sequences, though truncated at times, plunge the audience right into the heart of the action in a way not available even to real-life fans of the sport, be they sitting in the stands at the track or watching at home on TV. Once again, the intimacy of the medium of film makes itself felt in a major way.<br /><br />Why then the overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the film, the nagging sense that, for all the quality elements that have gone into it, the movie just doesn't amount to all that much in the end? Could it be that, when all is said and done, the story really isn't all that interesting or the characters all that compelling (Hunt's wife is given particularly short shrift in the screenplay)? Whatever it is, there is something about \\"Rush\\" that keeps us from giving ourselves over to it completely. So just enjoy the performances and car races and don't expect a life-altering experience from Howard's latest feel-good opus.n't amount to all that much in the end?

1439170916|5.0|In this highly readable &#34;biography&#34; of cancer the author details the slow relentless progress that has attended the works of scientists, doctors, and ultimately patients that have dedicated themselves to the war on this medical menace. The author at once journals the advances against cancer as a process of scientific fits and starts, and as much a matter of pure luck as any rigorous scientific inquiry. Bumbling, stumbling, rigorous,random and at times even brilliant cancer research has plodded along over the centuries much like a bulldozer in low gear.<br />For anyone having an elemental curiosity about cancer and its ravenous appetite to destroy and maim, &#34;The Emperor..&#34; is a modern day must read. The cast of characters that peoples the telling are for the most part a chronicle of the best in humankind: curious, driven, compassionate, intelligent, and ultimately profoundly human. A great book!
B00D6DVSAE|1.0|I have been a Sting/Police fan for decades but i'm sorry, this new work is giving me a headache. I am starving for a real new sting album. I just can't take this anymore. I know he is doing new and different things and he doesn't need anymore money but I am losing interest fast and I'm afraid it just doesn't matter anymore. Well, I guess I can still break out my old live bootlegs when I need to. Who is with me on this??? Anyone??  I know it will never happen but can you imagine if the Police went back into the studio with good intentions?. It would be awesome. I really don't want to be negative here but I'm just telling you the truth. Just my opinion. That being said, I'm still waiting for some new \\"classic\\" Sting material.
B00CBFPO12|5.0|Silly Colfer, fairy tales are for kids!<br /><br />If we got money for every time we heard that in our adult life, we’d probably all be rich now. Fairy tales are for everyone and Colfer proves it once again with this young adult novel. It’s aimed for young adults but we all know that even adults and children are reading this amazing book.<br /><br />Sure, with Colfer’s role in Glee and other projects, it’s hard to imagine he’s good at writing as well but you couldn’t be more wrong. Reading this book shows again that he’s capable of great character building, fantastic imagination and possesses a creativity that we all wish we hadn’t lost when we grew up.<br /><br />It has angst, drama, fun and humor all packed in 528 pages. The ending is a surprise but if you pay attention to the small details throughout the book that Colfer so mischievously places, well, then it still comes as a surprise. Colfer is good that way.<br /><br />He keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you want to read the entire book out in one sitting. Spoiling further evenings that you wish you could spend on the book. Of course, no one’s been hurt rereading a book a hundred times over. In a matter of fact, I’m sure that with rereading, you’re to find even more tiny details that you missed those other 10 times.<br /><br />No matter how old you are, the land of stories calls you to rediscover the fairy tales from your childhood and enjoy them all over again. The magical world from a long forgotten past returns to your mind and takes you along on a trip worthy of a Disney movie.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Loved this movie! All of the cast members are phenomenal. Tom Cruise did his own vocals and was fantastic! Glad I bought it.

B006QKKMBA|5.0|After Final Destination 2 things started to get campy, predictable and downright un-enjoyable.<br /><br />Final Destination 5 was a great re-imagining of what the franchise could be. The deaths were brutal, surprising and original. I really enjoyed the tie-in to the other Final Destination films as well. I will definitely watch this again.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I love watching this show and now I love playing this game. I really enjoy playing this game and I also can't wait for new episodes of this show.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|This is such an original, well scripted, minimalist execution of a fine horror film. You don't need hundreds of millions for a budget to make a great film. This is where it's at:  Believable characters, expert pacing and genuine scares. You know a movie is entertaining and holding your interest when you don't mind reading subtitles and you're still able to feel a sense of dread.<br />This movie, for me, is only behind Near Dark as the perfect vampire movie. Excellent.
0061730327|5.0|I read this book each night with my 12 year old son. It was a brilliant choice and really quite eye opening for a 12 year old to hear about how he was lucky to be able to go to school. It was interesting for my son and I to talk about what life might be like for people who are denied an education. We also tried to imagine what it wold be like to have no electricity, to have to go to bed simply because it was dark and you could not see anything. The story is very well written and I loved the photos of the windmill that the author built. It was fantastic to see how William managed to salvage parts from the junk yard to build his creation. You can also watch the author's presentation on TED. This is a wonderful book to read as a family. It is great when someone's life story ends up happy and is inspirational. I love it when we as humans do the right thing for a change.<br />If you have not read this book then you really need to. It is a book that works for any age group or gender who would enjoy reading a book about personal triumph over adversity. We read it for a special event at our local book club. We chose to do a \\"bring a teenager\\" with you to discuss this particular book. It worked well as it brought a different perspective to our discussion and it was a great way of including children in a hobby that I hope they will all preserve as they grow older.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The title says it all.  This is a game that is a pleasure to play and to look at.  Five stars all the way!!

B002RI9S2Y|5.0|My 7 year old son and I both loved beginning this journey. I had not been exposed to the Greek myths as a kid so it was enjoyable to discover the characters together. Refreshing storyline, less predictable than most. We didn't hesitate to start book 2. Shame about the movie :-(
B001L63JC8|5.0|Not many of the folks I know are familiar with this album, which is great for me. It is unlike any other Genesis album and I really cant compare it to anyone else either.  The songs on this album are like a great box of assorted chocolates.  You want to taste them all once.  Some you absolutley cant get enough of, others you are glad you tasted, but are better as part of the package than on it's own...  Most of the first disc is just one great song after the next.  The story is not concrete, but I believe it has something to do with the a young man and the journey of his sperm...yes his sperm.  I believe at some point in the story he becomes his own sperm on a journey towards conception.  Of course it is not perfectly clear cut, but if you try to build the songs around that concept, it kinda comes together. This was around the time Peter was becoming a father for the first time which adds to the possibility that he would be interested in writing such a tale.  Even if I am off base on this, I love listenening to the album and trying to make sense of this possibility.  Try it out and let me know what you come up with.  No matter what though, this is my favorite Genesis album and one of my favorite albums of all time.

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I bought this to replace my Anker® SlimTalk 3200mAh Portable Power Bank Backup External Battery. I always find my previous Anker external battery accidentally drained by its flashlight mode. I'm glad that Anker listened to its customers and released this new product that not only packs a punch of battery power, but removed the flashlight feature to avoid accidental draining.<br /><br />It's really lightweight and a bit smaller than the iPhone 5. You couldn't ask for more. It comes with a built-in USB cable, though you'll be needing a Lightning cable if you'll be charging an iPhone 5 or iPad Mini. Other adapters are included in the package. It also comes with a charging cable so no need to worry about that.<br /><br />I was able to get 4.5 full charges from this for my iPhone 5. Perfect companion for the iPhone 5 especially if you're running battery-hog apps. Saved me from the hassle of charging it every night.<br /><br />I even tested it to power my LaCie external hard drive and it did its job marvelously!<br /><br />Highly recommended for power users! Couldn't ask for more.... best slim external battery charger out there.

Definitely a must-have for every car owner.

I don't have any of them yet I still can't get rid of the quest. I also hate that it takes so long to replenish your energy. The more energy you have in the game the longer you have to wait for to fill up again.<br /><br />Pros: this is the best hidden object game I've ever played. You have new stuff to unlock and its sometimes a challenge to find the pieces. The better you get at a picture the less time you have to find all the objects. which makes it more challenging. I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />I can't wait for the updates!
