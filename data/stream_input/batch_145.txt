B001LA18UO|5|Bought a series of these stickers to cat up my jeep ! Love them durable and a great value !!! Highly recommend !!
B000HS1356|4|my last Dowco disintegrated at the seams after about 10yrs outside in varying mid-atlantic weather.  This one's ok - doesn't have the reinforced - temp shielded fabric on the lower side as the other.  Fit is good on my 1200 Bandit S.
B00LFE6OQO|5|Bright and easy-to-install. Polarity sensitive, so if it doesn't work just turn it around.  If replacing incandescent bulbs, you may also need a new LED-compatible flasher if the flash rate is  too fast after replacement.
B004QHNCY4|5|everything fit perfect and works as it should and at a great price
B002P8DCZU|5|Really great OEM look alike for a replacement if anyone ever needs to get one.
B000CI8WQE|5|Awesome. Only part, out of 10 that was correct and absolutely no issue.
B0010AH4BW|5|good quality, i ve already replace the original one on my car, still not sure will it get fixed.......but the stuff is good
B00C3CQTEY|4|Good light the plug tho came loose had to hard wire it good product will recommend it for any one
B008HZPCQM|5|Perfect fit, love the integrated warning sensors. Slipped right in, no squeak or noise and great gripping. Doesn't seem to be too dirty.
B005DSOD7A|5|I love my new stainless steel mesh grille combo, i also ordered the brake duct covers to complete the new image. It sure had turned lots of heads since i had it installed two days ago. Everything fits perfect. Some people ask what kind of car it is, i did not install the nissan emblem.yet.May or may not,just loving the new look now.I  would recommend this product to others,very high quality product.<br /><br />i
B000CSQEV4|5|Works like new for half the price.....I'll be back...
B00FDQPCR2|5|Does everything I need.
B00279T1CA|5|I installed the window motor and regulator assembly this past Saturday and everything fit perfectly.  The frame bolts on the regulator and motor lined up perfectly. The cable connector fit perfectly as well as the wiring connector slots on the (middle) regulator bracket bolt. Be sure to save the little plastic regulator top cable guide from the original one and install it on the replacement.     It was not clear in the product description which one was for the drivers or passenger front door. I had to take off the door panel and carefully compare the picture with the one in the door to determine which one to order, this was difficult since the bracket bolts are not shown in the pictures provided.  Fortunatly I ordered the correct one, front driver side.     Hopefully the product lasts several years, only time will tell!
B007IZX3IG|5|Perfect
B0018EUDHW|4|Seems to be a nice and user friendly unit.
B006YJNMYM|5|even came with instructions of how to put it on the window. smaller than I thought it would be but just right for what i needed it for
B000C2CHWA|5|very good
B00DAJFJRC|1|Didn't fit right and directions were not clear
B000O1C47M|5|Works perfectly.
B000W0OHY8|4|This is shorter than the Kryptonite cable, but instead of attaching it to the disk lock I just place it over both of the handgrips. There's no way I'm going to get on the bike without noticing it on the handgrips. It's not secured that way, but it hasn't been a problem so far. Who's going to even look to see if they could steal this?
B0055DQ2RC|5|i love that it's liked keys.  Use it for my trailer and it works perfect
B000KU74MM|3|I got this for my car.  I have heated seats, but I'm impatient when its really cold, so this is an instant solution.  It's doesn't get HOT, it gets comfortably warm.  Not sure it feels warm enough in 10F (-12C) weather, but it's sufficient for above freezing temps.  I've also used it in bed. Not a bad foot-warmer, although a cloth cover would be nicer.
B00480FIMI|2|Both low beams burnt out; bought ~ 1 yr and 5 months ago
B003Z9T33I|5|Very happy with this product, good deal for the price!
B00GDFC5C2|5|Great Product A Must Have To Add A Little Personalization To You Car! Arrived Earlier Than Expected! My Wife Loves Her Car After Applying The Decal!
B00HNGBRBU|5|These brake lines are top quality. Braided stainless steel covered in a plastic(ish) coating, tight connections.  Definitely recommended when any offroading will be done!
B005I3C0BQ|4|I found the fit and finish to be excellent in these shoes. They are easy to put on and take off. Removal slider along the side of the toe, just in case you go down. They say it is removable, but I couldn't get it to budge. Then again, do you really want your toe slider to move easily? Nice ventilation in the heat.<br /><br />Why 4 stars and not 5? They broke in really nicely and quickly after a couple of rides, but that could have been avoided if they were a hair wider like my Icon's.<br /><br />I worry about wearing them on my Harley because I think the ankle box plastic may melt or leave a mark on the exhaust pipes.
B000BYEOHK|4|Works well.
B009IFIB0Y|4|Not OEM. It looks and works fine, but it doesn't have the heated mirror symbol on it. Not a deal breaker, but I just thought customers should know.
B00198EAZ8|5|it gives a good light. always ready to use and doesn't take long to recharge. can be recharged at home or in the car.
B00AP854EO|4|Love my cover. I didn't really want seatbelt covers but since they came with the steering wheel cover its a great bonus. Match my car interior perfectly. I am a huge cat person so this set was the cats meow.
B005BZBLF2|5|Good
B007F5JRW0|5|I bought these to replace the OEM driving lights on my scooter, because I like LED Lighting. They provide that extra bit of visibility to ensure I'm seen on the road.
B00A75BSVI|1|OK FOR THE PRICE BUT JUST DON'T WORK WELL, WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN
B00BMU999A|3|You will need to be careful with installation & removal. The price was pretty good but i guess as the saying goes you get what you pay for.
B000EBMCQ0|2|Made out of very thin material, this is not in any way going to be something that will be anything more than an aesthetic add on.<br /><br />Be careful of your vehicle year;  I bought this to put on a 2006 Wrangler and, while it PHYSICALLY fits onto where the stock bumper was, the holes did not line up properly despite Amazon (and the manufacturer's web site) clearly stating that it would fit this Jeep.  Only one (of two) holes fit properly on each side on the top of the bumper mount.  The ones on the bottom on both sides lined up properly.  All of this means that not only is it built a little on the slight side, but it doesn't mount as strongly and securely as it should.<br /><br />On the flip side, the shipping was incredibly quick for something of this size and it looks great on the Jeep.
B0067PRKS2|5|This lasts and lasts. Put it on my car last October and its been through a northern winter, brutal summer - driving nearly 20,000 miles across multiple terrain. Yet it still looks fresh and new.
B00GH88YZM|5|Can't beat brass. Nice product for the price.
B00H2XZTUY|5|Love these! Great quality! Beautiful design! Easily installed! Get these!!!! I have received tons of compliments!!!! I paid $190 to buy them and the dealership charged me $135 to install.
B002N2OMUW|5|Awesome. Toyota was trying to charge me 250 dollars for this piece. So glad I got this instead.
B004MDSQ6Q|5|Perfect size screw driver for taking the bottom off a macbook pro, which is my primary use for it.
B004GSYAIA|5|Great purchase, I'm a big fella purchased this for my '16 Casita SD which hose had worn out and this 96&#34; made it possible to not worry about pulling loose, almost too long for storing in my cramped little bath but more than makes up for the ability to not have to keep turning!
B0002Z9QO4|4|lasted for one round trip of 1000 plus miles, which at the price, was enough for our needs, but still, not as sturdy as one would hope
B0016KJ5MC|5|The product was easily installed and is of quality construction. On my first use of the product it worked perfectly when towing my camper.
B001C4OBH6|3|It's a bit loud and boomy at full throttle. It's really bad if the window's are open. Not typical to hear a Navigator with this sound and I have to admit to liking it. I haven't noticed any power or MPG increase since installing it. The surround requires you to install some trim; which is a bit of a pain on the corners. Honestly, I'm not sure it really does anything more than hold the tubing up and it's a bit cheap feeling.
B00C3NX4PU|3|So-so quality.  Got it as a gift but chose not to give it, due to its lack of quality.<br /><br />Guess I got bushwacked...
B005JI7006|5|Fits perfectly,  it matches the original, & super easy to install.
B00COYNZJ8|5|I have a Kia Soul so it's kind of big for my windshield, but still works effectively. The elastic bands make for quick and easy storage! And, of course, the ultimate nerd-out for your car :3
B000H5WCY0|5|I use the 50 amp to 115 VAC adapter to keep my Motorhome batteries topped off in storage. As my unit has a standard household refrigerator it also stays cold.
B004A116XA|5|They worked great and easy to install and now I can lock up my toolbox on my truck for safe keeping
B003CETT9E|5|excellent
B003NI5IXU|5|Still going strong and I bought over 1 yr ago!
B00030415W|1|i tried it on my 99 ford taurus. i flushed the system and refilled with k&w block seal and water. i even took the thermostat out so it could circulate better. i let it sit for 24 hours to dry and refilled with coolant. symptoms came back the same day. what a waste of time and money. these stop leak products should be better regulated. how can they get away with using the words \\" repairs gaskets permanently\\" on their can?
B00029WYBM|5|the spray can is better than the squeeze bottle, it goes on even
B000B8I61G|5|Small and useful. It's designed for your standard can, or regular sized paper cup drink at a fast food restaurant. Cheap, does the job, and readily spray painted if you want it to match your car's interior.
B007EXMYIC|5|excellent product i recommend
B000FA91DC|5|This was a perfect replacement for my old cracked up vent.  Slid right on with no problems at all.  These vents are kind of cheaply made - but it's as good as the one that came off.  So the price is right.
B004X5QNYA|3|This is not a drop-in replacement for a 2006 TJ Unlimited.  The fittings did not match for the transmission lines.  I had to do an extensive search to locate an adapter fitting that would work with this radiator.  The screws to mount the fan shroud also did not work and I had to get a larger size.  Hole locations were good.  Not bad, but you will have to do some modification to get it to work in an '06 LJ.
B0015DMNIS|5|This thing was great, I used it on my 99 dodge to change the hubs bearings and cv axles on both sides .it was not able to get the bearing out but it was because I needed a different style attachment not the products fault. The vise grip adapter saved my arse when the cv axle came apart.pulled it right out with 1 hit.it attached to the hubs perfect and they cam out with like 12 or 15 slides with this hammer.very good quality, strong and hard steel I dont think I even put a scratch in it with the whole job I did.
B000FKBR6G|5|Installed it behind a 4 row champion radiator from CJ. Pony [RADA22]..<br />.Had to grind the pulley bolts on the water pump a little..fits and works good with flex-a-lite 31147 adjustable temp control unit from Amazon...installed it on  my 66 mustang 302 hi - po engine
B007QBJ9J4|5|Great price for exact part I needed!
B000NBKI7Q|1|I was really hoping this kit would be a solution for the noise problem since I never had problems with the belt coming off.<br /><br />I had this kit installed at the labor rate for @1.5 hours. One week later after some damp weather the noise was back at least as bad as before. Of course, now the parts were not under warranty by the installer since I supplied the parts. The previously installed standard Gates belt lasted a few weeks longer before starting to make noise.<br /><br />With the standard setup I had much better results regarding noise with the Goodyear Gatorback belt, which ran quiet for at least two years, but now I am stuck with the Gates enhancement and belt unless I revert at great cost again.
B002UC2Q0S|1|Not standard fit an no hardware included.
B005MZYE8W|4|Thought the description listed it as a magnet, but received a sticker. Would have preferred the magnet, but all-in-all a good product.
B00F5MU5YY|5|A must have for any RV shower. Uses very little water, but you get an amazing water flow for the shower even when dry camping.  The on/off button allows a little water to still come through the shower head when it is turned off.  That is how it is designed to work.  Yes it is plastic and it can break.  Use the Teflon tape that is provided and do not tighten too hard - no problem at all with the install.
B00I8U2B2E|5|get a lot of compliments on it. easy to install
B005ZWM0R4|5|Excellent product and Amazon Seller
B0013V6M7U|5|sent as a gift to my brother who was so thrilled he immediately put in on his vehicle
B007XZJZSI|5|It is what it says it is. Fit nicely in my 1998 Honda civic Hatchback. Just go them today so I can't say how well they wear yet. but they seem like quality products. They even have little Velcro flaps on the bottom to help hold the mats in place.
B00QQU6372|5|Fits great!
B002UZUEP4|5|Looks great fast shipping
B00HAOSWOK|5|Very Good
B0013TM0Z0|5|keeps me warm in my tractor-cab.
B004TRXNNG|1|sadly, this didn't fit my mini cooper. even though amazon said it would. I should have done more research before buying, but didn't, and learned the hard way when I showed up to meineke to put it on, and they said it would cost an arm and a leg to fit it.<br /><br />no thank you!<br /><br />flowmaster's instructions should be better, very cryptic, if described at all.
B00LM026C2|5|My mechanic said it wasn't difficult to install, took him about 1.5 hrs. I ordered it Monday afternoon with next day shipping and had the part at 10:30 Tuesday morning on the other side of the country in a snow storm. Had my car returned to me by 4:30 pm, good deal!!!
B004SX5HM6|4|lights work great for the price. little disappointed with how long the wires are. I read the reviews and other people said the same thing but, I didn't think they would be that short.
B001KQY43M|5|its very good kit no problem in fixing and great pedal
B007V2E3S0|2|I bought this aunshade thinking it was the original one, with the Mercedes bag, but not, it is an imitation of the Mercedes Original one.
B000E46BCS|5|I purchased this on Dec. 9, 2009 ever since I love it so much and keep it around my house and light it up whenever there's festive mood. I wish they can produce more. It's so exquisite and lovely.
B00BUTA12W|5|Good product
B001AY2WLU|1|I had just ordered this for my husband during the flash sale of this product on Wednesday, October 9th.  I was excited about it.  My husband usually carries a Leatherman with him everywhere and I thought this product would be nice for him to have.  I figured it would be nice not having to carry his Leatherman around once in a while.<br /><br />Well, I just received this product in the mid-afternoon today in the mail .  Which was nice.  It was a punctual delivery.  I am very happy about that.  My husband was excited to receive it and immediately placed it on his key chain.  However, as of 9:30pm tonight...it is now lost!  It fell off his key chain.  We don't even know where to begin looking for it outside of our house and driveway.  I know it was only $7.11, but holy crap!  He didn't even get to use it yet.<br /><br />I guess my warning is: Don't buy it if you want to have it on your key chain on the off chance of needing a small multi-tool at any point.  It will be long gone by then.  I wish I would have read the other negative reviews.
B001B7TSSQ|4|Works as advertised.  Installation is easy.  Especially like the removable feature for facilitating hauling 4' x 8' sheets. Would have given it 5 stars if it was $150 rather than $180.
B000BHKZIE|5|These work great. I'm glad I purchased these. I didn't intend to need the 134a quick connects at all and wouldn't have purchased them but my Ford has an odd size high side port on the r12 system. The only readily available way to connect it was to get an r-134 adaptor. They snap on really nice, the seals hold well and don't really leak when attaching or detaching.
B001C6Q7HG|5|It was exactly what we wanted & it arrived in good time.
B00FC22PVS|1|There terrible will never buy another set! They flicker and go out half the time they don't even try to come on
B00AMNO23G|2|This is a very cheap looking badge. it is very thin and looks awful when stuck around original insignias. I guess that's why its so inexpensive. I do not  recommend sticking it on a decent auto mobile.
B002JH7PEQ|5|I needed one of these for my wife's car.  This product got good reviews, and offers very convenient features...far better than other similarly marketed products.  The vendor had a good description and delivery was over the top.
B00FAIBJBG|5|this is the absolute must have for anybody who drives a BMW. If you care about the little things like aesthetics then you must have this. Is amazing how people drive a BMW and keep it clean but don't have the little things that make it look so much better. I bought two of these one for the front license plate and one for the back license plate
B00LHNU1IU|5|Excellent for looks. Perfect for a different look. To be different is awesome
B0061U99LY|1|Maybe it was just a defect with my purchase, but I've applied plenty of high quality vinyl decals on my various vehicles over the years & never had a problem.  They've all stuck up to the weather in Portland, OR so well.  This one, however, was garbage.  It was incredibly thin (all the die-cut vinyl I've ordered in the past has been very thick by comparison) and was peeling off of my vehicle within a week.  During our very fair summer.  I would NEVER recommend this.
B0015YC0PI|5|Measure the diameter of the tires and buy the appropriate size covers. The product is well made with nice material.
B00DYSDSAY|2|Did not fit and I had to pay return shipping.
B0023VBJ40|5|I could not get the film off my head lights. So in stead of buying expensive cleaners, polishers and buffers, I decided to just get new lights.  Much cheaper and a lo  less work.  Shipped fast and easy to install.
B005WQ1CTU|5|Quality made. Great product. They fit tight and they seem like they'll stay on for a long time. I have no complaints so far with it. It makes a little noise when you slide across them.
B00N44WO26|5|Great product will definitely be buying more stuff for my car
B00L1TX042|5|Perfect
B001AWGGD2|5|This fuel jug will fill a tractor quickly.  I uise one for the gasoline tractor and for the diesel tractor.
B008ADTRBM|5|These things came in quick and they look good! For the price I dig um. Mine fit fine but none of the aftermarket ones will snug on. I reccomend placing the new emblem on your OEM caps if you want them to stick around forever ;)
B000GD5FMY|5|These glasses are perfect for motorcycle riding. They are nice and clear and don't look too bad either. The fit is a tad tight but one thing for sure they are not going to blow off your head. they also do a great job of keeping the wind out of your eyes as del while riding. At the price, i can easily replace once a year if need be!
B0028PY8WQ|5|This is as close as you can get to factory. The metal is just the same and the chrome is first class and the black paint is high gloss.<br />If you lay a factory one beside it you would not be able to tell them apart plus the price is right
B001URVL3W|4|Sizes seem to run a little small but once they are one the feel fine.  Should be fine with this winter out shoveling snow.
B008MK56EK|5|Fits the Dart perfectly and there is no issue with items sliding around or the mat shifting.  Keeps all of the sand and water from my wetsuit from soaking into the trunk carpet.
B00HWJD02W|5|Great gift
B000TYVL78|5|Direct replacement... no issues.
B00WM36XNG|5|Good car garbage bag. Good size, easy installation, like the fact the top close, but doesn't take too much effect to open it.
B006O0H9PO|5|Good product, Fast Delivery
B00EC8XLH0|2|I had the lights were installed professionally.  What I don't like around the rubber part there is a gap and it just doesn't look nice.  Pictures were taken to show this before they were installed and there was a gap...picture enclosed.  We thought this would be different after installed but it is the same.  Not happy with the way it looks and it wasn't cheap!
B000B8U61O|2|It did not fit as expected and I will be replacing with another vent shortly.
B00KMR3GT8|5|I like it is really good
B006GT6IU0|3|will not allow you to read eeprom unless your vehicle is on the list, was hoping it would atleast read a basic binary of any obdII car but i was wrong, also does't seem to be compatible with any other software that i have been able to find. so if you are trying to tune an american car don't even try!
B0066Q358Q|5|Perfect size for a pocket yet works perfectly.
B0009IBJE4|4|My last Schumacher charger like this lasted about 15 years.  I think this is the newest incarnation of that model.  My only criticism is that the graphics are almost impossible to read, and the descriptions of the battery types are baffling.  You have to read about the new kinds of batteries to know what they mean.  Used to be standard, gel cell, and deep cycle.  No more.  All new terminology.  Works good otherwise and hope it lasts as long as my last one.
B006VRSIIC|3|I just installed a Roll-X cover to my 2015 Silverado.  The installation was very simple.  My daughter and I did it in under and hour, and we didn't rush it at all.  The cover is very good looking, and I love the rolling functionality of it.  I've used only tri-fold hard covers before, but wanted to try something different this time.  Glad I went this way.  But the product is far from perfect, as I've found out.    Plusses:  - Very good looking, as it's very flush with the bed rail.  - Still leaves enough room around the side for the hand hold hole (14/15 Silverado example)  - Easy to operate  - Sturdy construction, but probably not as sturdy as a tri-fold.  I wouldn't put weight on it.  - Very easy to install in < 1 hour    Negatives.  - I expect this cover to leak like crazy.  The front corners of the bed are left very open.  - Doesn't seem very tight on the bed, may move around.  Time will tell on that one...  - The closing method doesn't always grab correctly.  You have to push down on parts of the cover to make it grab everything as you close it.  - I don't feel this cover is very secure.  More later on this...    Lets go over the negatives a bit more.  The corners of the cover, especially the front corners don't seem well engineered.  I can easily see where water would seep in.  With a little wind the corners of the rubber here could lift leaving a gaping hole for water.  They should have made the seal in the corner more robust, and probably even engineered a clamp to work in the corner.  Or even better, it could use a cross member here along the front to help with keeping the front edge down and sealing of the corners.  The cover just \\"floats\\" here (float's not the right word, but I can't quite explain it like I want to.)  The install just seems a bit hokey, as you have to adjust a lot to get it to align just right forward and backwards on the bed.  They should know the length perfectly and just make it fit.  If there was a similar cross bar along the front edge as there is with the sides with a solid seal and have the cover attach to this front cross member I feel the cover would be 1000 times improved in stability, fit and water tightness.    Last, I really don't see this cover as being highly secure.  Seems to me you could easily slip a hanger under the cover at the tailgate and grab one of the release wires to undo the cover.  I don't want to tear my cover up, so I've no tried this.  But I can't see it not being that hard to get into the bed with this cover locked.    But, overall I still like the cover as it looks great and is easy to use.  Next time I'll probably go back to the Extang Tri-Fold hard cover, as it was solid as a rock and extremely secure.
B002T4IVT2|5|Just installed. Gives a nice firm ride. Boxing for shipping needs improvement. One box torn open.
B0007VFMBE|5|Installation was a snap. All bolt holes lined up with existing frame holes. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. Hitch looks good installed. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a good quality, good looking hitch.
B0002U1TXK|5|This stuff is amazing. You apply this to any black plastic on your car, golf cart, etc. and it is nice and shiny again. Makes it look like new. Plus, this was about $3 less per bottle compared to the auto-parts store.
B0024GJ568|4|I didn't own one of these, but have experienced what they do. I have a Fountain 38' Fever boat with twin HP500 (500 horsepower) engines. It has two rather large type 27 batteries, and since they were getting on in age, I used both at the same time to crank each engine. The other day they just wouldn't start the engines, so I had to use a large battery pack to get one started. Unfortunately, I had to move the boat and shut it down before we went out. When I tried to restart both engines after warmup, there was no way. I retrieved the battery pack from the marina to put on one battery, then put my own battery pack on the other battery....still no success. I was about to go get my 30 ft. jumper cables so that I could get to my 3 cruiser batteries when my slip neighbor said he had a little B&D unit. After seeing the size of it, I thought no way is this little thing going to start a high performance 502 cubic inch big block. However, after plugging it in and giving it the minute or so to build up it's charge in \\"Start\\" mode, it cranked right up. I was able to get both engines started and on my way. Obviously, I have now replaced the batteries, but I also have just ordered my own B&D Battery Charger Starter, and I would say that it's a lot in a little package. I have several trickle chargers, also two of the Schumacher battery chargers, but this one is much simpler to operate. With it's higher amperage charge (25 amps), it may be a little much for small lawnmower and motorcycle batteries, but will certainly do the job on automotive and large marine batteries.
B0042HTS6O|5|As advertised, works great. Thanks
B001AGHI8A|3|It seems like a solid muffler. Haven't tried it out yet. I was comparing two mufflers - dynomax super turbo 17662 [[ASIN:B001AGHI8A Dynomax 17662 Super Turbo Muffler]]and the thrush muffler of similar size - I chose the super turbo thinking there were these \\"patented\\" flow directors that would possible help it flow better than the thrush even though the thrush muffler was cheaper. When I got it I looked down the tubes and they have shallow circular dimples, maybe 1/4\\" deep pressed into the sheet metal. This is their \\"flow director\\"? Nothing like in the cross-section diagram of the muffler which shows a half circle bracket at the end of the flow tube. Go with the thrush muffler, both have the same metal case and save yourself some money.
B00GU0OKIW|5|Pricey to be sure !!! But, fits great and looks great !! Love your Jeep TJ ? Need a new console lid ? Buy this and get it over with.  It fits over existing lid so it makes it more solid and it's very pliable so arm feels good resting on it.<br />I used higher end automotive detail 2 way tape on mine and it's a dream ! That much spent, buy and use the better , appropriate tape !!  Really super nice add to my TJ !!
B000UVCK8O|5|I LOVE THESE LIGHTS - THEY'RE EASY TO INSTALL AND BRIGHT TOO. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!
B000YT2KFA|3|it was a struggle putting this on my seats of my car, I recommend that you make sure that it fits your car and please read the instruction.
B008TNNIN6|5|Easily transitions to all the advertised positions.  Very sturdy in every way.  Casters are of a high quality and work smoothly.  Looks great, moves great.  I would definately purchase again and recommend.
B00OHCVBA0|4|It was very helpful reading previous reviews before buying this product.  I did need to cut away a little of the plastic around the holding tabs for these to fit and the bulbs ARE unidirectional.  I installed all new bulbs to replace my original clear ones, but then had to rotate the ones that weren't working 180 degrees and reinstall.  They all work great now.
B004N63S9W|5|I have a 2015 Subaru Forester Limited, which has plenty of plastic (both inside and out) and leather. I bought this and used it to clean the plastic, tires, and rubber door seals, so I can't comment on its leather performance. Two to three sprays on a microfiber cloth goes a ways with this product, and the difference in appearance is immediate. It dries quickly and does not leave a film on the plastic, outside lights, or rubber. VLR smells like a faint cologne, which is not really a bad scent, and I couldn't smell it in the interior when I finished. Mothers does not recommend you use it to clean electronic display screens or the plastic screen protecting the instrument cluster, as it may cloud the material. When using VLR or any similar product, I recommend the interior be cool and not sitting in direct sunlight, since light plus a cleaning product could cause discoloration. VLR cleans plastics and rubber greatly.
B00IECAY1Q|3|Have not had it long enough to really rate.
B001CQWM8E|5|Easy to install and very sturdy.  It fits perfectly and was simple to install.  Should last years.  Would buy again.
B0040DXAWI|5|I bought this mirror after being involved in a traffic accident while changing lanes, I broadsided another car that was in the blind spot on the passenger side of my RAV4.  After the accident I was really afraid to drive again, so I purchased this mirror to see if it would help, and it is AMAZING!!!  I can tilt it so I can not only see traffic behind me, but I get a complete and clear total view out of each and every window down the right side of my vehicle!!!!  No more craning my head to the right trying to see if a car is in my blind spot!!!  I think these should be standard equipment on certain vehicles with a huge blind spot, like mine!!  This mirror gave me back my confidence driving my RAV4 and I highly recommend it for anyone who has a large blind spot in their vehicle -- get it NOW before you have an accident, I wish I had . . .
B0027XGIKO|4|Difficult to fit over handle.
B0054HMEQ2|5|recovery points for my jeep.  solid product.  Look like they will work perfectly. can't go wrong with these. super great d rings.
B00R34QIW0|5|This is a gift for our police friend. He will love it.
B000KPU8MK|4|I LIKE IT
B00GK8YHO6|5|Good
B000WJAH5M|5|These grip covers slip on with hairspray! had to go find some of that but once I did they work great.  Just enough additional diameter to keep my fingers from getting tired holding on and it decreases the vibration transfer (not totally but a good bit).  just an extra suggestion, the covers were about 1/2 inch longer than my grip so I cut that off with scissors and used it to double layer on the inside next to the thumb which gives you a little extra grip there, amazing how that little bit feels good, try it, if you don't like it snip it off later)
B0000AXNMO|5|Used it for years, still the best option out there for my cars and GoPro's too.
B000E9TS6O|2|Read the reviews and gave it a shot. Doesn't seem any better than plain old water in a bucket. It also leaves a greasy residue behind that is difficult to dry and requires a good detailer spray to tidy up. Save your money.
B00IBK8BYI|5|Arrived sooner than expected, and fit just like the original.<br />Very pleased with the purchase, not sure for the 94 to 98 my car is an 03
B001G3Q1L2|5|perfect and hard to find part. thank good ness we got this for my third car. I know it will last
B007H2PY50|4|I haven't had these very long, but they seem well built, and easy to handle.  I like them because they are higher than the normal chairs, so easier to get in and out.  I have had knee surgery and this makes it much better.  The chairs sit well in the sand too. So far I give them a 4.
B00U8OTUMC|5|great deal for the price. they work great.
B00NPQV06O|5|Love this very bright and we'll built
B00H3U5J9W|3|Can't beat the price. Also, these wheels are not very structurally strong. Putting any excess weight on them will bend them.
B000OUW978|3|The only real fault with this product is the seat padding.  The seat is not one you would want to spend a long time sitting on.  I think the manufacturer used about the softest foam there is.  Would be much better with a good medium to medium-firm cushion.  Guess it is about what you would expect for the price.
B005J1UK2I|5|I recently bent one of the rear original equipment jacks that came with my new PUMA 25 ft. bumper pull.  I purchased a pair of low profile &#34;BAL&#34; brand jacks from my local dealer and installed on the back of the trailer.  They were an improvement over the originals but I still felt like it wasn't as stable as my old 2006 Pioneer.  I did some on-line research and decided to order a pair of Husky's to replace the front jacks to see if it would make a difference.  They arrived as promised in perfect condition and I was impressed with their build quality.  After installing them on the front I noticed how much better they perform than either the originals or the new &#34;BAL&#34; jacks that are on the rear.  Their operation is smoother and they seem to make the trailer much more stable.  I will probably be ordering another pair for the rear so that I have a matched set of four Husky's.  The swivel handle is also very high quality and easy to use.  Definitely five stars!
B001MOSBRW|5|Just what I was looking to buy.  Tried junk yards for used  however this was  very easy and required little effort on my part.
B00TI6XRYS|1|Didn't work. The box was inoperable.
B005BTOR40|4|This tire cover is fantastic.<br /><br />It fit great, stretched over my spare easily, but fit snug. It was fairly wrinkly, one particularly large wrinkle is just starting to disappear. It may have been worthwhile to open it up and let it warm up inside considering the temperatures lately.<br /><br />It's a pretty dark gray and the writing is more of a dark silver than what I thought was white in the picture.<br /><br />All in all its great. I just hope it lasts.
B004ZF31PC|1|I have just bought my second set for my wife's car.  It is amazing the difference and how much clearer everything is now.  AND my son took the case all the lights came in to keep all of his games and stuff.  So he is happy too.<br /><br />Update... had a problem with the lights intermittently.  Kensun called me today and are going to take care of the issues.  They seem to be very attentive and I feel this will be resolved.<br /><br />Update....  I give up!<br /><br />I want to give the company props for trying as they have send extra transformers and tried to help but they do not last.  Purchased 2 one for FJ Cruiser and the other for an Outback.  My wife drives the later and had to simply take them out because you did not know if you would have one, two or no lights.  No I am to the FJ and experiencing the same thing and they did last a year or so, but not worth the price given all the aggravation.  I really wanted them to work, but $200 later I will call it a lesson learned.<br /><br />*WHEN THEY WORK
B0013FWI1K|5|This item arrived really fast & the price for a dealer only item was the best I found online! notes. if you are replacing this part it is the whole front Transmission mount w/all of the brackets that connect to tranny block & Fram!!  Also this part at the dealership is around $250 so this is a steal for the same part! Other price I found online was $168 before shipping costs!
B000N3W8J0|5|This &#34;grit guard&#34; turned out to be much sturdier and better made than I expected.  It fits in the bottom of a standard 5 gallon bucked, does what it was intended for, and looks tough enough to last a long time.
B00CS7N5R8|4|its a little snug but a great shirt
B00D42AFS8|5|its perfect
B0050VONTS|5|Works Perfect , Has great parameter settings and nice features such as Oxygen sensor testing. Have used serval times on European specification and United States specification cars and does everything i ask of it . Good quality, does not feel cheap like A Actron reader.<br />Would Recommend
B0012ZITCS|5|You car start shinnig. All the products are just a superlative.<br />Very easy to aply, and excellent results. Amazing kit
B0002KKIXC|5|This product works so well I keep assuming I'mg going to see a report that it's toxic or dissolves metal or something. Seriously, this cleaner works exactly as advertised... it removes stains nothing else would touch. My wife and I have cats... and carpets... but you won't find any cat-barf stains. Wine, oil, oily dirt (we live on a farm) just lift right off the carpets. Highly recommended.
B0052KI59Q|5|Good
B000QJG1F8|5|Whats to say!? It almost doesn't matter what kind of car you have, they all can use a flowmaster. Everything one has come to expect from the leading manufacturer in performance exhaust. Made my 04 grand prix gt sound like it should in the first place. I love the growl and grumble at low rpm cruising, and the crack at 6000 rpm is awesome. However there should be a warning with them about the unwanted attention from cops with nothing better to do with their time than harass guys with loud exhausts.
B00E82KA7O|5|Manufactured by Maric Performance.<br /><br />I bought the Hyper Optik which reacts to UV to darken. As face shields are UV treated, it will not darken. HOWEVER, preventing fog on your shield it is AMAZING!!!! I am riding to work in 25* F temps and no fogging what-so-ever. Vision is not impaired at all. I can close all the vents and keep the shield close and were the insert is, (which is all that matters) it is clear as a sunny day.<br /><br />It will fog around the insert, but that doesn't matter. After all, it is not part of the processes as it is not being attached at those points now is it.<br /><br />The installation was a breeze! Directions are clear and concise. Went on without a hitch. It is also much thicker and more pliable than the for mentioned one. Just a far superior product all the way around.<br /><br />I tried the Fog City brand and I wasted my money. Installation for the Fog City was painful and didn't work. I wasted $17 and change. I will be purchasing another InVision immediately to replace the inferior Fog City brand one. Do yourself a favor and by the InVision Hyper Optik insert, you won't regret it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. (That is a hint Maric Performance to send me one free??? ;) Great product!
B007Q8LV98|1|it doesn't look like on the pic at all. If you wear &#34;large&#34;, don't buy the large in this jacket. Buy medium as the large of this jacket is actually XL. The quality is very bad. I don't recommend to anyone...
B000C5DUN2|5|Good price, perfect fit, got it in just a few days.
B002ZWIGT8|4|Nice Product that satisfies the purpose.<br />Simple and basic but ok price and good shipping.<br />I would recommend having 2 straps instead of only one
B003U91R82|4|Good replacement. Easy installation
B003YNWBH0|5|I have bought these before and will again. I like Fram products and use their oil and air filters too.
B00230KYCE|5|Works perfect with my stock ignition on a 1981 cb750c. Fits even better then the original one did.
B000C5WCUE|5|This is exactly the same product which honda stealer will sell you for $220.<br />I purchased this along the TENKON 4929 3/8-inch Drive by 7/8 Inch tool. When I removed my OEM upstream Oxygen sensor, I saw that it was made by Denso lol. So if you can do some wiring job (30 minutes job), then this is a big $ saver. If you are not comfortable, I would recommend buying the one that comes with the harness and is ready to install. I have a Honda Accord 02 EX Sedan so the wiring from OEM did not match the colors on my OEM harness. After 30 minutes spend on google, I found out the correct way to do this. The two blacks of OEM should be connected to the two blacks of the new sensor. The white should go with the blue, and the green should go with the white.<br />I have driven the car for a week now and no engine light has come since.<br />I hope this will help someone in the future.
B000J44710|4|The mounting system can be a little difficult to get just right, and there is no way to lock the bags shut (even with a luggage lock). But these bags are good quality. I laid down my bike going about 30 with these on, and they only have some minor road rash.
B002IF3GZG|5|it is the original spark plug but for a  lower price! I would buy it again as the quality is really good!
B008EKM7OU|4|This is my second Bilt Paddock Jacket.  The first was the mesh jacket.  So please refer to that review for comfort and build quality.  With this jacket, I bought it a size larger (4XL) for one specific reason....to wear another jacket under it.  I am 6'1&#34; and weigh 255lbs.  The jacket itself is too large for my frame.  Before I bought this jacket, I knew that I would be wearing one of my older jackets underneath it.  While I do like the look of the jacket, I simply find the protectors not adequate for my peace of mind.  When I do wear my older jacket underneath this one, the fit becomes more comfortable.  I live in Germany.  So having that extra layer of clothing does help me stay warmer during the late summer and fall months.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
B00AEI7Y3E|5|Good part and came quickly.
B009BGRIRM|5|fits well thank you and at a cheaper price than auto parts stores
B004I1EXCS|4|This product arrived in good condition and appears to be an exact fit replacement for the OEM Hellas that came on my 04 Passat.  At first I was concerned about the plastic adjustment screws but then the whole reason I replaced the Hellas was because the same mechanism broke when I tried to insert a replacement bulb.  I figure the adjustment mechanism on these couldn't be any worse, especially since the Hellas are double the price.  Had WagenWorks Jacksonville, FL install them and so far I'm very happy with the part, the lighting beam pattern etc.  Would buy from Depot again if I ever have the need.
B00P9DUPQ2|5|Looks much better in person than in the image.  Works well so far.
B00DJEDGVY|5|Not hard to install, took me about 20 min to get it in. SO much nicer than the stock fender. I would buy this again in an instant.
B00GW456T8|5|como nuevo
B001H8VLFC|5|I am completely impressed.  I bought this product for my car and left it in my car over night and the smoke smell was completely gone the next morning.  It's true that the smell from the product needs to have time to air out but it kills any smell of smoke.  I would totally recommend this product.
B000FZVVR6|5|Fantastic shade.  Arrived earlier than expected. Fits like a glove in the window and noticed difference straight away.  Only issue if it can be called that is it was difficult to roll back up. Highly recommend to others.
B001U27N84|2|The light looked good and was easy to install, even on my tile roof. However it only lasted about six months and quit working.
B000C42SQ8|4|I purchased this stabilizer for my 1999 Yukon Denali 4x4 I had to torch out a hole on the frame for the main bracket bolt. It didn't have one I could of drilled one but would have been more time lol. Other than that works great I would give it a 5 star but I had to do some work lol good bye \\"DEATH-WOBBLE\\"!!!!
B00EDT1O72|5|Where I'm from stores don't sell anything like this so everywhere I go people ask we're I purchase my steering wheel cover
B001GH5PX8|4|works
B007FXHZHQ|5|Item arrive on time and it was perfect for my car and the quality of the product was good. This is a good item.
B0093PMJC0|4|Pretty good product. Not perfect. The mounting bracket that takes place of the carb float bowl bolt made my carb on my drz400e leak gas. So I had to make my own mount. And the rubber shielding ripped. That may have been my fault during install. Threw some grease where it ripped, no troubles yet. But it works great, does what it's supposed to do. I'd reccomended it
B008D7KXYK|5|Was as advertised. Works well
B005NLQAHS|5|I used this tool to buy a pre-owned vehicle.<br />I was able to scan many vehicles many types and models. Thanks to the scanner I was able to get a good vehicle in excellent condition.<br /><br />Everyone is asking me where did I get the scanner and everyone is surprise about the low price and the usability of it.<br />I paired it with the TORQUE software and I was able to use it on my android phone.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product.
B00B0WZJIU|5|I had some leaky Slime repair plugs.  I pulled the Slime ones out and replaced with these safety seal and so far the leaks are still sealed.
B000JFNAMQ|5|Good scale and so far I have not used it for refrigeration purposes.
B00EWSOUA2|5|Great look, and very good price
B000VUC566|5|Fits perfect in the Honda Ridgeline 2013
B000B6JJUK|5|I'm on my second one folks and love it!! As far as turning the unit on just place the tool over the valve stem and press firmly with your free thumb and wait for the beep!! There is actually little bumps where I place my free thumb to get the right seal. Like any tire gage you need to have the right angle. People that have commented on the quality well this needs to be said there is a lot of bling for the ten dollars that you have invested.
B004AA1PUK|5|Perfect fit.  Saved a good gas can from being replaced.
B0054KWAYU|4|use to haul a kayak on a Ford Freestar. If you have a wrench and common sense you should have these on in less that 5 minutes.<br />They are not rigid but strong enough for my kayak. It is 75lb and it sets mostly above the factory side rails so the weight is not supported in the middle of the rack.
B005CLPOHG|5|a little skeptical at first with the price compared to the dealership but to my surprise it worked great!!! thanks guys
B00KTJ4KFS|5|I bought this one because it was the cheapest. This works perfectly. The rubber button pad inside wasn't an exact fit like the OEM remote (2001 GMC JIMMY) so you have to take the rubber button pad out and put in the little circuit board before you put it all back into the shell.... nothing to really complain over.... but it fit and the buttons work just like the original remote without any problems. Great buy for $4.95!
B005I60VZK|3|The key works beautifully, however the advertising is deceiving. The product description indicates that the only thing necessary is to have the key cut. We actually had to have it programmed because while the key fit after cutting, it wouldn't start the truck until programmed.
B002R13N68|5|great. Just like oem
B00MYF7ZZC|3|I just set up my trash can today.  I was a little disappointed that the lid fit cock-eyed as I like things to be square!!! I believe that I put the pieces in correctly and maybe it will straighten out after its been used a bit.  It fit nicely on the back of the car seat and I am looking forward to having a clean car!
B0006SU3QW|5|Product came quicker then I expected, was in great condition and met/exceeded my expectations.
B00510GH24|5|It was a great deal.
B001TLC12E|4|Fit oddly but stay pretty secure.
B000CSEZ42|5|Arrived on time they worked they were pre gaped no issues they were what they said they were. Cheeper then buying from jetski dealorship.
B001UJB8T2|2|I have to agree with another reviewer that this cloth is almost identical to those you find in Walmart.  It is THIN THIN THIN and not at all worth the price.  This is a surprise from Mothers as I use a lot of their products and typically their quality is excellent.
B002R0RBKS|5|Good fit for my K10 Suburban.  The original lenses were faded yellow, partially melted and cracking from the years of uses. These fit as well as to be expected and helped improve the look of my restoration project.
B000M6034U|2|Cheaply made.Te ring at the bottom falls off and the top piece keeps unscrewing when i'm using it, and the rubber piece already has signs of cracking after little use
B0051USD80|4|The product pretty much works as advertised. I  did follow their instructions and had no real problems. I used hose clamps instead of the clamps advertised with the heat shield, due to the bad reviews they have had.<br />I used it on a Buell Ulysses and 15' is somewhat short if using a 50% overlap. The titaniunm color is really nice match for the frame.
B00F0YHZSQ|3|I have a 2007 Ford truck and there was no way this would fit as it was delivered.  I had to mount it on the wheel with bolts that were twice as long as the ones that came with it.  Don't know how well it works yet, but I suspect it will be fine.  Since it is made of metal, I can't wait to grab hold of it after it bakes in the arizona sun for several hours.
B004PL4H0O|5|These straps work perfectly for lashing river tubes together into a floating barge!
B0018IY054|2|I bought this item with high hopes, but found it doesn't do a thing for my vehicles.  It does produce some ozone, but has no blower to make it effective for the whole car.
B003CIVAH4|5|great key chain would buy from this seller again
B005DX6BKW|5|First thanks to all the previous reviewers for the detailed comments and helpful installations tips. They really helped a lot!<br /><br />The lights were easy to install and hook up to the battery, and work perfectly - very bright daytime running lights!<br />Didn't take me more than 20 minutes to get the lights installed and the wires run to the battery terminals.  However, hooking up the orange dimmer circuit \\"sense\\" wire from the DRL control box took me much longer, as, for the RAM 1500, it requires removing the whole headlight assembly to get to the parking light feed wire for the orange wire connection.<br /><br />Thanks again to a great tip re the Kent Kroeker YouTube video ([...] only for the 4-LED DRL, BTW) and another excellent video for the 8-LED DRL installation ([...] and then following other leads from there, I found these two YouTube videos that best detail the RAM headlamp removal:<br />[...] [...]<br /><br />If you are installing these on a RAM and don't have prior knowledge of the headlamp assembly removal and re-install, these videos are a great resource.  If you're not too mechanically and electrically inclined, you'll need to get help from someone who is.<br /><br />The lights look great and the dimming circuit works once the main or side lights are switched on.  Hopefully all the issues reported in the previous comments( mostly from 2012) have been resolved by Phillips.<br /><br />I'm very pleased overall and will post my photos of the installed lights in a few days.
B000F1929Y|1|It's not fit on my dashboard
B001OML246|5|fairly priced and delivered promptly. Exactly what was needed to replace the warn out console in  the 2007 Town and country mini van
B001546QZS|4|Lightweight, nice finnish, needs a matching ball set and a silencer.....or a grommet that keeps it from ratteling, this unit adjusts the trailer heigth and improves the towing angle
B000CPI86Q|5|My bushings were shot on my 9112 Rancho shocks on my 85 K5 Blazer...they are sold bushings by themselves without sleeves, your gonna have to use original sleeves like other review. Pretty simple job....
B002X55TRE|5|Looks great and it applied very easily. I wish they had them in more colors than just black. Maybe brown.
B006N98P2C|1|Very misleading name, It said was a kit, but it comes only one
B002OXKE9I|5|When I placed my order I believe tu purchase a simply keyholder:  delivered I opened my package and cannot believe at my eyes. wonderful item, a kind of unique jewel.
B0002UEOLO|5|It's anti seize, it lubricates. Easy to apply to spark plugs and very little mess. Color is grey. What's not to like?
B00B2YHGGE|5|These 16 leds r bright as hell...I really like the way thy give off a blue look frm dome light....never goin bck 2 factory bulbs again ever.....
B001S8L3JU|3|I purchased the Bully CR-607 to add addition back-up lighting to my 2011 Toyota Tacoma.  It was shipped quickly and came as advertised. After fitting it to the truck I did not like the looks of it so I didn't use it.     What they don't tell you in the advertising, but should:       The light sticks out beyond the receiver nearly 3 inches.       It does not simply plug into the trailer connector; you have to hard wire it into the reverse wiring and a constant 12volt source if you want all functions to work.  It does come with a 3 wire quick connect plug so it can be removed easily.       It can only be used when the hitch ball is in the hitch receiver.  It has a set screw to hold it in place.  I thought I could use a hitch plug to hold it in rather than the leaving the hitch ball in constantly, but the plastic is about 1 inch thick and a plug will not work unless you modify it by adding about a inch to the plug and drilling it out so the hitch pin will hold the plug in place.       In it's defense there is a switch on the unit so you can turn the lights on and use as a work light without putting the vehicle in reverse.     I have given this item only 3 stars not because it will not function, but because personally I did not like it.  I have since mounted 2 flood lights under the trailer hitch platform and hard wired them in using a relay and hardwire 12 volt source from the battery.
B00DQFL7JO|5|works with fass titanium black
B000GU235O|2|The Manual Tries to cover to much  and does a pure job with all .almost no trubleshooting .
B000VKRQ7Y|4|These are a bit more flimsy than the OEM product but they work just fine for a lot less.  They are easy to install.
B0041TU2XQ|5|Fast delivery and easy to install
B008N8ILQG|5|I originally wanted a shorter one, but this was all I could find in a wide manly strap. There were some cheaper ones, but I wanted something beefier that could hold up to some projects that were outside of the normal realms of its intended use.<br /><br />Enter my stupid uses for a tow strap. I had a bunch of nasty thorny bushes that I could not even get close to that I lassoed with a slip not then yanked the crap out of them attached to my Toyota FJ. I then pulled out some old stumps and some huge fence and fence posts on the side of a hill that were buried in concrete by some crazy person who had the property before me. No other method I could think of would have the possibility of working and the pro guys with bobcats estimate was over a thousand dollars. I even had all four wheels of the FJ spinning on a concrete drive yanking and that is some kind of force.<br /><br />The things that I did should have destroyed this strap. It survived, I survived, fence, concrete, bushes, stumps were not so lucky.<br />Five stars all the way.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/9/2014. Just used to pull down a wall that was dividing a garage. Worked great.
B000CIPUR8|5|I've used this 3 times, on two different cars.  All passed, even the Chevy with a check engine light.  I live in Los Angeles, with the strictest smog tests too.  This is a great product.
B000YT9HW4|3|ok
B0012X0MWA|5|I installed these strut assemblies as OE replacements/upgrades on a 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan with 135,000 miles.  Very easy to install.  Great ride improvement.  I also installed new rear shocks at the same time for a total ride upgrade.  Once I had van supported and wheels off, installation took about 30 minutes per side.  Install strut brackets on spindles in same location as OE's that you remove.  I marked location by spraying white paint on bracket and spindle before removal.  Front end alignment was nearly perfect when checked after install. Great fit and quality product.
B00068XCQU|5|i have used battery tender plus for many applications. motorscooters, motorcycles and several automobiles, including, corvettes, mercedes and Toyota. I recently used a new battery tender plus on a FERRARI F 430 that i recently purchased and it works perfectly. you simply have to connect the ring terminal harness to the battery. The battery charger/tender that Ferrari has sells for about $400 plus tax. The battery tender was actually recommended to me by a Ferrari Dealer. I have had excellent results from Battery Tender plus.TDanna
B0006JJ57Y|4|I've installed this in our boat and it works just as advertised.  It was easy to install.  Operating it is simple, just turn one valve and the water is bypassed from the inbound cold fresh water right back out through the hot outlet side.  This lets you take the tank out of your water system in preparation for winterizing it.  This saves you from paying for 10 (or more) gallons of antifreeze that'd just be sitting in the tank.
B003GC74NK|5|Works as expected
B004GFS2C8|5|Used on star chip with very small crack starting to show. Followed instructions and now you would have a hard time finding spot that was treated.
B0045O6S1C|5|My husband owns a TRD Toyota truck and where I like to &#34;bling&#34;, he likes to &#34;chrome&#34; and deck out his ride.  These are a classy little noticable touch that adds just a touch of elegance taking it to the next level
B004MDEV38|5|easy install, great product
B00429NKWK|4|Headlights cleaned up really well. Plenty of solution/paste/sandpaper in the kit to complete two headlights. We'll see how long it lasts.
B004SBXAU4|5|It's amazing how new my 2007 HHR looks now !!!  You don't realized how bad the old faded lights really look until you put on the new ones !!  Fast shipping and a great price too !!
B00898LAJ0|5|Great product.  Very durable.  I put it on my Polaris Ranger.  It is solid, easily mounted, easily adjusted and stays where you put it until it gets hit/scraped with a mesquite bramble and it just ... swings in.  When I get through the tight spots I just push it back to position and it stays there until it gets hit again.  Very happy with this product and I recommend it highly.
B00RNISJIC|5|It is PERFECT....thankyou.
B000CB4WWO|5|Beck Arnley is a good manufacturer of these and it is a good OEM replacement.
B004JB3EQ8|5|The timing belt and water pump was the proper fit for my car and everything worked out perfect.The price was very good,service was great and the delivery was exactly as told to me.It is installed and working great.
B005FI5BBA|3|The license plate frame is very cute with the saying. BUT if you have two license plates required by your state, as we do in Virginia, you probably cannot use it. It will cover up the stickers on the bottom of your license plate. It is made of plastic, not metal. The blue is as seen in the picture. It is a very clever design and catchy phrase if you have no problems with sticker location. Would work perfectly for those who can put a non-state, commercial plate on the front of your car. For all those reasons, I probably would recommend with reservations.
B00681BDXI|5|After reading reviews on a large number of keyless remotes. I was very aprehensive about this product. However, after recieving it and using it I could not be happier. It was very easy to program and it works just as well as the original. I highly recomend this product
B001O09QSM|5|I purchased this for my 07 Yaris sedan. It took a couple of hours to install it, with most of the time spent removing the old header. This was a perfect-fit match for my car.<br /><br />The only tricky part during the installation is that this header uses the OEM header gasket, which is difficult to see since the header is behind the engine in an already-cramped engine bay. The OEM gasket happens to be pretty flimsy and it can be difficult to keep it in place while trying to install the header. Most of this process is more easily accomplished by touch rather than by sight. If you don't get the gasket in exactly the right place, you will only be able to get 4 out of 5 of the bolts/nuts back into the head. If this happens, remove the header, reposition the gasket and start over.<br /><br />The instructions will warn you that you can't get fingerprints or grease on the ceramic coating because it will stain the header. This is probably true, but I caution you to not try installing this with gloves on. You can't see the header anyway, so some stains in the finish shouldn't be too big of a problem.<br /><br />The difference in the performance in my car is astonishing; however, I have also installed the DC sports stainless axleback exhaust and a cold air intake before the header, which now amplifies those upgrades. The car sounds deep and loud, and drives in a way you would expect from a bigger vehicle. Normal city driving has become effortless, and highway driving is way better. The Yaris can now go from 60-80 in what seems like just a couple of seconds without having to floor it. You don't need any dyno charts or special tools to tell you that this is a huge upgrade for the performance of your Yaris.<br /><br />Again, this header well worth more than what I paid for it, and certainly worth more than the $100 or so extra you spend on this brand versus the competitors.
B0002KR88A|5|Words great, Nice and sturdy.
B002UWK4NE|5|I purchased this item for my niece,which worked out well.The car makes less noise and was much cheaper than the automotive store.I recommend this product.
B002SDRG7W|5|Its OEM camshaft. Works on my BMW 1998 528i perfectly. Had a check engine light and that disappeared. Passed my Emission
B00009WC2N|5|These kits work great and are easy to install if you have a wiring schematic for your car. This is my second bulldog remote start. The first is troublefree after 2 years.
B00NRBSQSW|5|Perfectly reflective!
B002I0GYZU|4|No real difference after replacing the 90k mile AC OEM double platinum; but honestly, in all my years of working on cars, I really never have noticed any real changes when replacing plugs. These were not pre-gapped  as some stated though. You have to be really careful when adjusting the gaps w/ these plugs. All in all a good deal and I also get a rebate. Be sure to use anti-seize lube when installing these. I actually had to use a breaker bar to remove the original plugs installed on my Silverado; guess GM saved 25cents or so on each vehicle by omitting anti-seize compound.  Update 08/21/15  Just wanted to report that I did receive my rebate check!
B003UM42J0|1|I could not get my Toyota highlander off the floor. It may work for a low clearance sedan, but nothing else.
B00HZVTS1Y|5|Makes the truck look much better and pops
B008427D88|5|On time as expected, will continue in the future purchases
B0058U0O1M|5|A great replacement starter. Works flawlessly.
B007T87RBQ|2|I thought I could manage my 7m ARB snatch strap well with this strap but this is too big for it. No matter how you roll your strap this doesn't fit well. You might as well roll and put it in a recovery bag or strap 2 snatch ropes together. Anyways .. I wouldn't recommend this for your single snatch rope ! It's just a buckle with ARB written on it!
B000BPLNXC|4|Exposition:  I'm not native to the snow-bound regions of the U.S., so scraping ice and brushing snow were skill sets I learned later in life than most.  In the 10 or so years of using brushes and scrapers, I've somehow managed to bust and break no less than 4 or 5 with (what I think is) regular use.<br /><br />That said, I bought this brush based on the comments, and I haven't been disappointed yet!  It's a very solid feeling brush and scraper, and has wonderfully stood up to my Magilla Gorilla usage.<br /><br />Brief note:  Anyone who pays attention will note that this brush is 26 inches long.  I am apparently not one of those people.  It's an excellent brush, but a bit short for comfortable use on my full-size pick-up truck.  Learn from my mistake and don't assume that this will have great reach for those with larger vehicles.  But for anyone with a car, it's perfect.
B000CN7V48|5|Love them. Have them on my G-35 Coupe. Along with EBC rotors they work great.  plan to use them again.
B001EWM16E|3|The product arrived and I was to say the least pleased with the overall quality of the product I received a metal emblem with the red and white TRD stripes. 3M tape on the back was cut well, a couple blemishes on the chrome finish but very minor all in all. But, what strikes me as weird is I received a separate package from them with the same shipping info and I opened it to reveal a CD for a trumpet player... very odd in my opinion
B008ZZ1N5I|5|Very bright reverse lights for my Corolla, big difference from stock bulbs.
B005032988|5|dont know if he will put this on his truck but i hope he does bc i would in a heart beat
B0075L126I|2|I ordered one of these a few days ago and it came missing the hardware and all the paperwork. I just Installed my bakflip vp which is good. I am going to keep this in hopes that I can get replacement hardware or I will just make my own. I cant say yet how well it works, but I have high hopes for it once it is correct.
B000BOAX1G|5|Work great
B0078KG4BE|3|I bought this to replace the tail/brake light on my motorcycle, hoping it would be brighter and react faster.  It's not as bright as the regular incandescent bulb, and the difference in brightness between tail and brake light isn't as great as with the incandescent bulb (an ordinary 1157). It does work, and is very compact.
B00C7XMQFA|1|some parts did not fit good on my chrysler 300 touring 2010.
B002NZRDIW|4|Have not installed the Thor inverter as yet, will do so in spring on my Rv<br />I have read very good reports on the Thor Inverter that is why I have chosen it.
B008BVRGC0|5|I put these on my backpack. I love how both sides of the keychains have the flag, and the fact that the keychains make a heart.
B0007LVD8U|5|love it, very sturdy
B002XL2IEA|5|I haven't used it on our camper yet, but see no reason why it won't do the job.
B000XG8Q0W|4|Works fine, but plastic grocery bags get stuck on the little hooks and I always end up having to rip the grocery bag to get it off. Perfect for purses or anything with a thick handle.
B000CQZYB2|1|I got this covers for the back on my 07 Toyota Tacoma,<br />They don't covet the whole light and don't looks good,<br />Maybe you would like it, but I don't .
B003WOGVU4|5|Good
B0057GQHLS|5|this is exactly what i needed, just a simple and cheap shade for my car. i bought two, one for the front and one for the back, and it has made a major difference versus not having one at all
B00797FUO8|1|Its too bad a person would know exaclty how silly you were  just by driving by. Guns kill people too.
B005VW2AIM|5|This is a fine chain.  It did the trick.  Easy to break to the right length.  It worked fine.  I'm not sure what else to say.
B0009TO2AG|5|good stuff, works on bellow and so much more, I also use it on my Dirt Bike grips, they stay on great.
B00LMP3XKQ|5|Excelent sunshade, fits perfectly
B001EAQTRI|5|Shipped earlier than expected.  Item works perfectly.  But i dont really like the packaging.  There is some wrong spelling on it making it look like some cheap electronics from china. It doesnt also have any clear instructions.  Thats not a big deal i know,  for most the buyers knows what it is and how ro use it for buying it in the first place,  but that gives the item the first impression.  But over all im happy.  It works as how it is supposed to.
B002R0ASEE|5|the original taillight circuit board failed in my 2000 Tahoe.  This replacement part I bought through Amazon fits perfectly and was priced competitively.  Anyone who needs a replacement like I did should have no hesitation in purchasing this product!
B00695Q3P6|5|Works GREAT in my '02 Jeep Liberty.  No more crumbs in my lap when &#34;dashboard dining&#34;, and when I flip it over, I have a comfortable mini table to take notes for note taking between client visits!  Wish I had found it years ago!
B00HJ9JBMI|5|Very smart
B000S34NG6|4|When the ambient temperature was less than 30 degrees, the transmission in my Caravan would shudder between 1st and 2nd gear (the same thing would happen in the summer with the A/C on). I suppose this is a common problem and was encouraged to replace this part. After installation, I tested it out and the problem was solved.
B00MQAEMNI|5|it arrived quicker than was told and it looks great on my new camaro
B001EOWQAS|4|The hitch fit well and looks very sturdy
B000LY9GDM|5|Exactly what I wanted!  Perfect looks great on my truck!
B002LRSZHA|1|I realize that these are inexpensive gloves - but somehow I didn't think they'd be so cheap.<br /><br />They do look fairly nice, and the armor is good. However, the rough seams inside the gloves make for a less than comfortable fit, and after less than two weeks of use they're already breaking down. The mesh fabric on the fingers has started to fray, and I don't expect them to last much longer.<br /><br />There are many good products on Amazon that you can get for a great price, but these gloves shouldn't be on that list. I would suggest looking elsewhere.
B00JBI8HD4|5|Must have for your E46 Sedan. Transforms the look of the vehicle by about 10 years with the LED's. Make sure it has the proper error free ballast if your car was produced before 9/2001.
B0053ZAIYU|5|great! come off and on well! bright!
B002P48AXS|5|OUTSTANDING PRODUCT.  MAKES LOADING LAWN MOWER AND ATV PERFECT.  THE LENGTH AND QUALITY OF PRODUCT MAKES IT EASY TO USE.
B001F15SNW|5|This tank works as advertised.  I used it to add an additional to two gallon capacity to a one gallon compressor.  Quality built product, highly recommend it.
B000SOIRCG|5|I have not used this one yet, but I have used it's smaller brother & they are excellent for getting trash & water out of gasoline or other fluids. I travel a lot with my boat. I carry fuel in several containers & buy fuel in places I've never been. It is good to know, that when I transfer the fuel to the boat tank, I am sure I am not getting any garbage.
B008BHBEE0|2|Does what it's supposed to do for the most part.<br /><br />The picture and the description don't match, they're not low ESR Sanyo capacitors.  It would cost more to return then than to just keep them...so I kept them.
B00L97660G|5|Very sturdy
B004RNR9QY|4|These are great and work beautifully. I was considering this vs the neverkink product and went with this one as it was cheaper for similar quality.<br /><br />The only problem I have is the pipe makes this ring formations and it is really hard to straighten it out. Doesn't really create a problem as far as water flow goes but makes it really hard to store. I am thinking of getting one of those wheels that are used to store such pipes so that it makes it easy to store.
B007CVSBL0|5|These were exactly what I wanted and really did not cost too much. They seem very durable and work perfectly for me!
B006B28A94|5|I purchased these and was pleased to find the performance I expect from EBC pads at a fraction of the price of buying them in a retail store.
B000JZY91M|3|I've replaced mine twice already.  Mostly seems like a design flaw on part of the Aztek having too heavy of a hatch.  The struts work fine for a while, but when temperatures get below 60 degrees the struts cannot generate enough lift to release the hatch above the secondary latch.  This forces you to go out and lift the hatch and then push the hatch release button again.  Even worse in freezing temperatures as the struts will not support the weight of the hatch at all (watch your head).<br /><br />I've had the same problem with the original and both pairs of replacement parts.  After about 3-4 years the struts just don't generate enough lift to hold the hatch up at all.
B00MERBOBQ|5|Good quality
B003XJ80UC|5|Solid piece of gear.  It will be in every vehicle from now on.
B000BK5496|5|Better price than from the dealer.  Same quality.  Love it.
B008S9G0CW|1|WARNING - This is NOT a drop in replacement for a 2010 Kawasaki Concours 1400 battery! The top of the battery between the terminals is higher than the stock battery and the plastic upper cover will not snap into the receptacles in the lower battery tray.<br /><br />Silly me, thought that a battery description such as WP14-BS meant a 14 amp-hour battery - that is the way it used to work. This battery is labeled as only a 12 amp-hour battery. I guess some manufacturers just don't feel the need to follow historical standards and do false labeling. I'll have to see if Amazon can at least fix their applications database so that no one else wastes their time.
B0038RTE9K|5|great bargain for these items ..far cheaper than others but good quality..would highly recomend for all who wish to make your car look sharp and not break you
B001005QIU|3|Did not completely remove all haze or streaks from three floor length mirrors in entry hallway. However to be fair, these mirrors have been up for many years, and maybe nothing will do the job.  This product did better than other products we have used.
B00BITKUUM|3|Works ok, but only been using it a few months and the drivers window button sometimes doesn't work at all or I have to hit down before I can roll it up.  Meh....you get what you pay for.
B00K889FCI|4|nice
B003EB48XC|3|Price wise is a good buy, but you have to buy one at least once per month. I think they are plastic. If they could sell a metal one, i would be willing to buy it even if they charged like $50 or so for it.
B000CFQ2VY|5|Really well made.<br />Good instructions.<br />Solid, heavy steel brackets.
B000R3SNJU|5|Best buy for its duty!  Works great!!
B00BFDFY6Q|5|Item as described
B000CD8HQY|1|This worked well for a week, then one fine morning it started streaking just a little bit. A month later it left a patch of smudgy streaks right in my field of vision. Poor quality, will not buy again.
B003ZWHVZW|5|I could have bought a $100 handle from Nissan.  This works just as well and installed just as easily, and I expect it will last the 10 years the original lasted.  Good price, fast shipping and a quality product - what's not to like?
B001S81EQM|5|A+ Worked Well
B003V16KK4|4|Starter works good
B00LOZV35G|5|I was very pleased with it.  It was just what I was looking for to express my love of our four footed friends.  It was shipped and received within just a few days.
B00DDZWAZW|5|Battery worked well. I had the issue with my iPhone 5 where the phone would shutdown when the battery level read 30-40%. This has now fixed that problem and the phone lasts all day without issue. Installation was pretty straight forward as there are plenty of instruction videos on youtube
B000CC0HZ4|4|sturdy and does the job.  It rattles some when no weight on it and will fall off when you drive over bumps when empty.
B00KTHWZIE|5|key needs to be cut.... but it is as advertised.
B009P1VCX4|5|Just what I was looking for!
B00D8E0SRA|5|Great quality!
B0013916XW|5|Stick well...no issues.
B00LX28WAO|5|Fantastic quality and performance, especially for the price. Very pleased.
B0097HA1JM|1|Really don't waste your money on this cart, it's junk. My tires ripped at the bead when I put air in them and they said they would replace them. What a joke, they have not replaced them and now they wont even respond to my e-mails. The phone number they give is also a joke becouse it just rings no one ever answers and there is no way to leave a message. It's been 8  weeks now and no new tires but they sure were quik about charging me for this product. Simply put DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this cart.
B0085FP62Y|3|They look great. They do however shake at idle and driving highway speeds. I was dissapointed because after i had put them on, i went to close my door and the mirror popped out of the housing and shattered on the ground.
B0016OMLWE|5|Quick delivery fit perfect for my 2013 tundra I strong recommend this product
B0036QVCOI|5|Great product. One side is all black and the other side has a center that is not all black. When I noticed it, I had a great problem where to put my decal. Either in the side of the all black or the other side which is at the center is all cromed. They painted both sides really good. I chose to still put my decall on the all black side because my decal pops out more in a strong darker back ground. In short, this beautiful product will give you two options where to put your decal. Both of them are well done.
B000GZBZOE|5|Very pleased with the quality and easy installation.
B00PA6TGSQ|5|quickly arrived and was well packaged.. would definitely buy again. thanks so much! :)
B007CFIVOI|5|It is nicely made and has very bright colors. My husband likes it and I do too. Looks great on the back of his work truck.
B0049VLQ18|5|Lower bottom frame is heavy duty steel, the posts are a good height & covered in protective foam with adjustable &#34;L&#34; swivel grip on each post to prevent glass from jarring around.<br /><br />Excellent quality for the price
B009SWFFUQ|5|Like the keychain and valve in great conditions
B000Y4HMLM|2|NOT AS BRIGHT AS WHAT MY HUSBAND HAD IN HIS BIKE<br />WENT ON HIGHWAY AND COULDN'T SEE AHEAD OF HIM AND TOOK IT OUT<br />SORRY!!!!
B00D0MSX36|4|Works exactly as expected for a decent price. Shipping to Canada has additional charges but all in all I'd recommend it.
B00BD7P4XW|4|Not very heavy plastic but it is OK for the price.
B007KTINZ8|5|I only use Turtle Wax Ice products on my vehicles. They have out performed any other brand I've used.
B00DJBZRJQ|4|Nissan wanted over $350 for one factory mirror and it didn't match my car.  These don't match either (my car is goldish), but they are black and I could change both so they match each other.  Problem solved!  They feel a little cheap when you are installing, but they look and work fine once you get them on the car.  Installation is pretty easy too.  3 bolts per mirror and you're done.
B000JFJLP6|5|Product was fully charged and ready to use out of the box.  Since purchase have used it several times to jump start a 1948 Chevy Pickup street rod.  Worked like a charm.  Also use on a riding mower with a low charged battery.  No more do I have to position my big Ford pickup near another vehicle so I can use jumper cables.
B000OYZDUE|4|User friendly isn't the what to say here AWESOME! Is what I say.  I have used these Cab Protectors in multiple ways and they have not failed me yet and they still look New.
B00EZWOB9K|1|its not good junk product. first the ballast went out after 2 days. now bulb went out after 2 weeks. don't buy it item real junk
B000AO33XW|5|Had the hitch for about 1.5 years and its kept its shine and has been really nice.
B004QAS0JI|5|Ordered this little spotlight with mixed feelings. After receiving it, I hooked it up and was pleasantly surprised. It is compact, but very bright. Service was great from Amazon as usual and it came in quickly after I ordered it. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a functional inexpensive spotlight.
B009TB4DHW|5|on time and as advertised
B008WGKEXM|5|Thanks : ) *****A
B009AQS4IU|5|Nice craftsmanship. I enjoy the product.
B00KBKOAGY|4|Helps a lot when sun cannot be shielded by visor.  Not perfect but much better.
B007Q9XI48|3|You get what you pay for.
B0031I20EC|5|Love this product, affordable and fits my moped perfectly! I got a small and I drive a 49cc E-Ton moped. It has a handy little clip on it to prevent it from blowing away and keeps the rain off my seat!
B000BO9KBK|3|purchased this to be used as a door seal on my 2009 GTS. it is too thick, u need to force the door close. not good in my eyes
B00BFDG4QU|5|Good one!
B00I8SJI9A|5|I just got this exhaust last week, Coffman customer service was great and very helpful and quick to let me.know.that the.color I requested was going go be delayed a few days. It was well worth the wait, took only about 10 mins or so to install, and the looks of it are amazing, its so much better then the behemoth of an exhaust that comes on the bike stock. Most importantly though the sound is amazing, it definitely adds the much needed character that this bike was missing, i definitely recommend this to anyone who has a cbr250r and is looking to liven up the bike and there overall experience when riding it
B00B9IVRCW|5|The jack works good had no problem putting it on the wiring it up May be a little confusing for someone that don't now much about wiring but other than that I like the jack
B00EJVIPVW|5|I love the product. My lights are bright and make my Juke dazzle even more than before. All my lights work and came in a great time frame.<br />Thanks so much for being a honest and trustworthy seller!
B000WK4B5I|5|She love the quick on and quick off with just the flick of a wrist. I want to get myself a strap too! lol.
B007I75D8W|5|I have a rear back up camera and this definitely makes a hugh difference from the stock reverse lights. It lights up the rear very significantly and I can see very clearly. Looks are great too compared to the yellowish stock lights.
B007Q4SUDM|5|ok
B001GSEMOA|2|Won't buy again, a real pain to apply,  and won't last long, already starting to fade, but you never know until you try.
B00K8BPARY|5|Just what I wanted and very good quality.
B001944ZO8|2|Pants ride a bit low on the waist but otherwise the fit was fine.  I wear a 38 pant and ordered a 40 in these.  That was just about right.  Unfortunately, the first time I wore them, one of the snaps on the waist broke.  I contacted the seller and they offered that I could either have them fixed myself for a partial refund, or send them back to be repaired.  I chose to return them for a full refund.  I had to pay for the return shipping either though they were returned for being defective.  Not too happy about that!
B001P2EF9E|5|After accidentally letting a tool  fall into lock and then closing it the lock was broken. Ordered this to replace it and now it works like brand new.
B000JZY61U|5|Easy and fast installation.. what is good is how strong they are.. automatically opens the hood.. cant beat that.. takes a little ump to close the hood..
B00C5SOMIQ|5|Good
B000WJX29U|5|This same battery would cost me $80 at dealership, here - almost half the price.  I bought it for my Kawasaki Ninja 250
B003FBV8ZW|5|quality glasses, great price, function just as they should... only thing that would be better is interchangeable lenses, so you wouldn't have to have 3 separate pairs of eye protection.
B001GLOZ6M|5|Love my sticker
B0029NX8EG|1|Called the tech. support for the company and tried everything...  Adjusted the output air pressure low and high and didn't make a difference. What seems to be the problem is the seal at the Zyrtec fitting; when I applied a little pressure to the tip with needle nose pliers it seemed to help a bit, but always had small air bubbles that wouldn't go away...  Also the design of the way the full bottle of brake fluid attaches to the MB Reservoir is poor; it actually damaged my MB reservoir threads when it fell over. No matter how tight or what position I used it didn't help...  Bottom line is its not worth the money spent...   Speed bleeder Zyrtec fittings were cheaper and a better product for one person to bleed their brakes.
B003CEN0U8|1|Not a good product. don't waste your money. However it is a great idea, just engineered poorly.
B002V9P5TO|5|Fit perfect just as listed
B00DYSDSAY|5|Fantastic!
B001PWA0IO|5|This is one of those things anyone with a truck should have.  You can just pop the handle and let the tailgat drop, it will glide all the way down.  It does not make the tailgate any harder to close.
B003PO69VC|5|Great towels but I found my local auto parts store sells the entire kit separately, I'll need to compare prices.
B000BZL08U|3|Universal O2 sensor better price than you could get at the stors.  Some cars are fussy and will trigger a check engine light even if its working properly so check your car..
B00KTJ0EA8|5|Highly recommended!!!
B003YLIHT8|5|Works as expected
B002UD0GIG|5|Works well. Takes a good amount of elbow grease, but it can restore even pretty badly scratched plastic. Even works on some other synthetic surfaces (eg. Delrin).
B00KH9PW3E|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  It keeps the car so much cooler.  I can use the steering wheel without burning my hands.  I can sit in the seat and my backside doesn't burn.
B000CB7DG6|5|This filter fits in the top loader of my BMW.  It is the same manufacture BMW uses but at a much lower price.  When I've used other brands they haven't fit as well.  This is a great choice for your BMW and you can trust you are getting the right part,
B009PVC1ES|5|This is one of the very few oils that meets the specs for my '04 Passat TDI engine as they no longer make the required oil Castrol 505.01 motor oil.<br /><br />While I haven't used it yet, it is highly recommended on the Passat users web site. I know it will be just fine.
B000BMDIU6|5|I looked around for a windshield bag to utilize it if for a stereo system installation. This one appealed to me after reading some reviews about it and the price was good so I purchased it. Windshield bag arrived in a timely mater after inspection of it I was very satisfied with the product appearance, quality and straight forward easy installation. I installed my bag on a Memphis Fats Windshield no problems at all it toke 10 minutes all fit just right. It was installed with one of the existing bolts on the windshield between brackets. Final installation and looks , I was very satisfied with it. I would recommend that product and the seller.
B005BNYV2Y|2|We received this non-slip tape, but it does not stick to our steps at all.  We put it on the steps, and after 2 trips up and down our steps on our camper, I was walking with tape on the bottom of my shoes.  Did not stick well at all.  We are considering using it, but using some type of adhesive to secure the tape to the steps better.
B007PKB79G|4|Worked perfectly on Sebring with 2.5L, used with 1/4&#34; dr torque wrench.
B0015PMQDI|5|3m is the best iv been using this for years it works and will produce a mirror finish on your car
B0055EALW8|5|Very good
B002929M3I|5|I well recommend them good price & quality
B002EAH85O|4|I rode a quick six miles last night on my road bike for the first time wearing these glasses. It's prime spring bug season. I literally had to clean the glasses off when I got home. There were plenty of good splats on the lenses, so they obviously served their purpose well.<br /><br />They do make a good seal which I could see being great in the cold. Another benefit is that in the warm, you don't get the air drafting around behind the lenses like you do with an open eye lens. Makes me want to look for a dedicated cycling pair of bright glasses, but I prefer my sunglasses as they are polarized prescription lenses.<br /><br />I have a big head, 22.5\\", putting me into XL helmets for most manufacturers. These fit me just fine. However they can shift a bit with helmet movement.
B005N221G6|1|Just received the light in the mail. Both map lights were defective. I wouldn't order these again. I did buy Diode Dynamics before and they worked great for 3 years. Same price and better quality. I think I will buy those instead of wasting my time with this seller.
B004LF5C5S|3|It doesn't come with the spring as indicated in the picture. It said 2011 my truck is a f250 2008, it fits but I would not know the difference.
B000ALJ4MY|1|I suspect that some of the poor reviews of this product may be due to the fact that people don't realize that repairing the windshield does not necessarily mean that the damage will disappear completely. This is not the case. I followed the directions to a T, and after the resin had cured, began to level the area as per the instructions. The complete repair then popped out of my windshield. Not only did I waste the cost of the repair kit, I wasted an afternoon applying it. Do not buy.
B002XM5G70|5|Direct replacement fit exactly. May need to extend 12 volt wires depending on your existing wiring if they are too short. Much quieter than original.
B000BPLNXC|5|loved it! Great service
B00DFMFYCO|4|good
B00E6A728I|1|The design in the picture was great! If I would have received that sticker like it is pictured it would have been great. But I did not! I received a totally different sticker. Contacted the seller who said they would fix the problem. Was excited, only to open the new envelope with the same wrong item only smaller!<br />Very disappointing to order something only to get a different item! Would strongly recommend not ordering from this seller. Very frustrated!!
B0012S9A5U|5|Worked great on LMM Duramax stock exhaust removal!
B003PJ945K|5|Exactly what I needed.
B008XKMW9G|4|Well made and designed specifically for Volve XC 70.  Might be better if a bit wider to cover the luggage tie down tracks.
B00153EWLY|3|I would not buy this brand again, based on my bad experience.  However, I bought mine back in 2003, so perhaps the bugs in this model have been worked out by now.<br />I would've given it 2 stars, but it did get me through Hurricane Sandy by powering my 2 refrigerators (its first emergency use), so I'm thankful enough that I'm giving it 3 stars despite its bugs.  Mine does not work correctly in all modes, doesn't work the way the instructions said it should work.<br />I found some workarounds, but they're complicated, so I had to write my own instructions and tape them to the inverter -- I'm pasting them below:<br /><br />A) Without remote control installed:<br />Problem: Inverter does not work correctly with low power loads, like a transistor radio, whether or not it's in power saving mode.<br /> 1) With power saving mode enabled, it would work for about 30 seconds or so, then turn off, when attached to low-power loads like radios.<br /> 2) Even when the power-saving mode is disabled, it still acts as if it's in power-saving mode(!): it stays on for 30 seconds or so, then turns off (at least for about 10 seconds, then I think it went back on again by itself for another 30 seconds or so, but Corina thinks it stayed off), when attached to low-power loads like radios.<br /><br />Cases where it works correctly: It seems to work okay only for high-power loads, over 100 watts, even with power-saving mode enabled.  I've used it successfully for my electric drill and my weed-wacker-type Toro trimmer, and it takes a few seconds to come on but it works.<br /><br />B) With remote control installed:<br />Problem: inverter does not work correctly in power-saving mode (even though I set the dip switches as instructed, five six and seven off).  When put into power saving mode using remote (hold down button for 5 seconds until green light comes on remote), inverter acts up like it did without the remote control when power-saving mode was disabled (A2 above): it stays on for 30 seconds or so (green light solid on remote and inverter), then turns off for a few seconds (green light off for a few seconds on remote and inverter), then turns back on again (and turns on again even without any load attached!)<br /><br />Cases where it works correctly:<br />When using remote, it works fine with power-saving mode disabled using the remote (orange light solid for inverter on, orange light flashing for inverter off).  Turn the inverter on and off (keeping power-saving disabled) by one press on the remote button.<br /><br />Summary and tips:<br />Without remote, works only for high-power loads (like drills, trimmer, etc.), regardless of whether inverter is in power saving mode or not.<br />With remote, works only with power-saving disabled (orange light on for inverter on, orange light flashing for inverter off).<br /><br />If I need power-saving mode: disconnect remote, and use only high-power loads.<br />If I need to use low-power loads (like CF lights or small radios): keep remote connected, with power-saving disabled (orange light), and then switch the remote on by a short push (orange light turns solid).
B000MS5T4W|2|I bought these in January 2014 to put on the hinges of my large metal gates. They fit great and I was very happy with them - NOW (May 2015) they're very cracked and I'm back here looking for a different brand/type.  These may work great under the hood/inside a car - maybe it's the U/V light that gets to them????<br /><br />I was going to get the black ones but they take 3+ months to ship???? I may still get these - they work fine for a while and I don't want stuff (rain/dirt) getting into the fittings on the hinges - the fittings were installed pointing straight towards the sky so I  feel the need to protect them somehow - maybe put a small metal cap/cup over the fittings and hold it in place with wire.....
B001Q3AZBY|5|Did not come with fairlead (as picture), but that was ok as my winch did. This plate mount was perfect for my 08 Kawasaki Brute Force 750. Instructions were easy to read and this was easy to install. Note: do not tighten all nuts down completely on the u-bolts. I had a clearance issue with the front mount bots that go through this plate to the winch. I had to leave the plate somewhat lose to get those bolts in the holes. I then tightened the u-bolts to secure the mount plate. The winch installed easily, after doing the wiring myself. This plate is awesome!
B00CQD4BUE|4|It is a dramatic improvement over the OEM. It is over priced. Which it seems can be done because there is no other after market alternative
B0053P69IO|5|Easy installation. Any one with a wrench could handle it. Took me about 20 minutes
B002YQVIH2|5|Had one on my car and then bought a new car so needed another!  It's an important reminder -- to me, when I'm tempted to display less than Christian-like behavior when driving.
B000CAINRK|2|Cheaply made of thin wool pieced together from 4 scraps. Backing is fabric, not hide. Feels lumpy from sew lines in material. Most sheepskin seat belt covers are one piece of hide. I am throwing this in the garbage. I won't bother returning it, as it was so inexpensive it is not worth the time to package, label, and deliver it to a shipping center. Lesson learned: &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Great product!!
B002IVCWRI|5|Great product!  Attaches easily to my boat trailer!  Just the right device for trailers!
B000OV3NDQ|4|I bought two of these for my husband's birthday.  He wanted something to put in his man cave that he could sit on with a buddy and drink a cool one.  He has a work table/bench that is about 38 inches tall and I was hoping that these would be tall enough so him and his friend of choice wouldn't feel (or look) like little kids sitting at the table.  I liked the idea that these are adjustable in case one fine day he actually does something out in his man cave other than sit around and gossip.  Nowhere on any of the reviews or even in the product description...does it say how tall or how low these will adjust.  I took a chance because of the good reviews on the quality and durability of the thing.  My husband is a tool snob, only buying the very best of everything.  He is, afterall, a diesel mechanic so I give him credit for knowing quality when he sees it in the tool and hardware things.  This reminds me of something made by Snap-On or MAC tools, it really is a good quality chair.    The box it comes in is quite small so I was amazed it was as big as it is.  It was delivered very quickly and even the UPS guy was envious of my husbands gift.  It comes in quite a few pieces that all fit together well in the box.    As the wife of a mechanic, I never have to assemble anything, thank God, but I wanted to surprise him with these so I gave it a try.  Much to my astonishment I was able to follow the easy directions and assemble it myself.  All I needed was a size 14 metric wrench and a Phillips screwdriver.  When it is all the way raised it is just over 23\\" tall at the seat.  The wheels glide around easily and there are 5 of them so you don't have to worry about tipping over backwards.  The wheels are a good quality rubbery plastic, like that on skateboards.     When my husband sits at it, he can easily rest his elbow on the workbench too. The workbench hits him about mid-chest when he is sitting at it. He is 5'9\\" tall and his feet easily touch the floor,as do mine.  The seatitself isn't as comfortable on a curvy bottom such as my own and I thought the back would be a little taller than it is.  These are deffinately meant for people who kind of lean forward and actually do work on stuff, not sit around and talk to their buddies.  However, the heavy duty wheels and the little tool tray at the bottom make this a good all around seat or stool for whatever you or your husband do out in his man cave/garage.  I reccommend this product and think it will last my husband and his friends a good long time. If I can put it together ANYone can do it.  Ladies, surprise your husband and get him one of these-he'll love it.
B002ZS4QCS|2|There's nothing to hold down the hook onto the headrest pole, so as you're pulling your bag from the hook, the hook itself goes up with the bag.<br /><br />The other issue is the weight of a normally packed grocery bag will bend the hook some, which narrows the opening you have to pull the bag handle off of the hook.  So, this coupled with what I mentioned above just serves to be extremely frustrating.
B009ZWFLYO|5|Incredible response time.  Perfect Product for an OEM match to an 11 year old car. Thanks
B000B8Y016|5|thank you
B008CE0O8E|5|works like a charm
B0056ELTEG|5|This is a very sleek looking helmet, the large fits me perfectly the size chart does not lie. The flip up front fells robust and the flip up shield is quite good quality and cleans easily. I used it in a light rain my head was dry, no leaks (the rest of me was not so lucky). there is a small whistle at speed with the visor up but with it down it is comfortably silent.  Great choice for a good looking comfortable piece of truly safe safety gear.
B001650XEG|5|I can wear it under my helmet or just by itself. Either way it does a great job. The face shield does not fall off easily as other balaclava because of the the pointed design that goes over the nose.
B008V6RF5S|5|Love it! Keeps you warm on the cold morning MTB rides. It is true to fit! Highly reccomended to anyone that MTB's
B0009IQX0E|4|Yes, there are waxes that will last longer, bead better and possibly shine more.  However those waxes require lots of prep work.  Who has time to clay, polish and then wax?  The beauty of a cleaner wax is it cleans, polishes and protects.  Sure, you can buy a more expensive wax, slather it on, and the car will look great... until the next rain or wash.  The wax will wash off and you'll be left with dull paint again.  The reason a new car looks so good is because the paint it polished and free of oxidation and continents.  This wax will get you back to that place.    Pros:  -Strong cleaning action  -Good polishing action  -Very easy to use  -Huge value for the $    Cons:  -Stains trim  -Not as durable as some  -Needs to be applied in shade    If its been a while since you've waxed or you have a car that is parked outdoors 24/7, you'll be hard pressed to find something that works better for the amount of time you put in.  Remember, thin is in, no need to glob this stuff on, just use enough for the applicator pad to glide on the surface.  Work it until the paint feels smooth and move on.  Allow to dry for 10-15 minutes and wipe off.
B006PIHT82|5|Real nice!!!
B000F3XZWC|5|This knob is sexy and very clean, It does have a smooth surface and also a shiny feel but it's not chrome-like.
B000XPMKFU|5|I love this Tonneau Cover! It does its job; secures your property that you leave in your truck bed.  You do have to have a tailgate that locks or someone could steal your cover as easy as it was to install it.  Closing and opening the tailgate with the cover is a little difficult because the cover really seals the bed; it feels like opening something that is airtight.  Shipment caused some of the seals on the side to dent, but the cover still works fine.  I would definitely buy another cover from Extang if I had another truck.
B001FZJ9SS|3|Light duty, will probably last a year, but thats fine, the sun is harsh.  the mounting hardware provided is super light duty, might want to find some yourself to substitute with.
B0016GVM9A|4|This is a very nicely built cable.<br /><br />I think the length is from tip to tip, other cables seem to measure from connector to connector, so the effective length is more like 14-15 inches, which could be a big difference for your application. Even so it was enough for my application (as an aux for my car) so I'm pretty happy with it.
B000LNQGNG|5|I have a Weimaraner and a Sheltie.  The Weimi is a five year old rescue that is being trained for an invisible fence and the Sheltie is already trained so she runs without a leash. My wife and I get up early and it is usually dark when I take the dogs out.  Since my Weimi is new I want to keep track of him even when he is on the leash.  I also want people to see him if we are on a walk at night.  I bought this product for the reasons above but find that it is nice to put on my Sheltie as well.  I get a lot of cars going really slowly when they pass our house and see two red blinking balls prancing around the yard.  This is a very nice device and I am glad I bought it.  It is easily seen by drivers and walkers alike.
B004N5WHE0|5|Great item, just as described.
B0001Q2DKS|5|The console fits perfectly between the two front seats of my Honday Odyssey, and holds EVERYTHING: my water bottle, tissues, nail file, notebook, pens, pencils, driving gloves, cell phone hands-free ear attachment, coupon book, handi-wipes for the kids, baggie of dog treats, book of crossword puzzles... and even more I can't remember.  Everything is easy to spot with just a quick glance away from the road in front of me, and then easy to pick up while I'm driving.  It's all low enough that I can climb over it with ease, if I need to get to the back seat (not while I'm driving, of course!).  And the price was excellent!  I'd recommend this to anyone without built-in storage between the front bucket seats.
B00514BAR2|4|does what it is supposed to do easily installed
B0019COQ6C|5|Like most of the other reviews, this gun is great! I went through a couple of cheap ones that lasted less than a year and had no power. I use this on two, 30 year old machines, a wheel loader and a log skidder, and pumped 7 cartridges of grease into the two of them in about twenty minutes. The continuous feed has no competition-I would never own anything else again! You'll only be disappointed if you DON'T buy this grease gun!
B00GFYY2S6|4|My husband really liked this. It looked a little small on his truck though. Larger graphics would have been more helpful.
B000BQQM6Y|5|This is a exceptional quality power belt it works great on my rotor tiller. I highly recommend buying this belt on Amazon to others.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Good
B000O51VJ0|5|Great addition for the frequent camper.  It produces a reasonable amount of heat, is easy to use, doesn't make you smell like campfire!
B0002SRCMO|5|If you are like the DIY'r like I am, you will run into those super annoying fasteners that you have to pry out with your flat-head screwdriver. And 9 times out of 10 the plastic fasteners eventually start to look mangled. This tool applies just the correct amount of pressure allowing you to get under the recessed points so you can pry the fasteners out without damaging the plastic edges.<br /><br />Pro's -<br />Lightweight<br />Nice rubber piece that goes up and down to prevent damage on the car while you pry.<br />Nice finish on the tool<br />Relatively cheap<br /><br />Con's -<br />Plastic handle is rather slippery, so add some skateboard tape to add some traction<br /><br />5/5 in my book!
B00LIAOX5O|5|Works great easy to install!
B003YLMQHC|5|The part was ordered following the breakdown of the cabin Fan control.  It seems to be a common problem for these vehicles.  I was a bit skeptical at first, considering our Dealership was asking over $230 for the same part and harness.  This replacement part, was supplied with the harness, for only $37+.  It has been on the SUV for months now and works like a charm.  -&#34;A gem of a find&#34;.  Excellent service.
B008VL2PZS|5|Just as the title says.<br /><br />NOTE-a must have if your going to run the led 7 color underbody lights cause the wires are to short to run the front and rear lights...
B0002M9WHS|3|I bought the standard black and white Hella 500 covers a couple years ago when I got the lights, and yes, they were kind of snug fitting, it took a little doing to snap them on and off, but by the same token, they stayed on well at high speeds and over rough roads. However, when I took them off for a drive this fall, the plastic just fell apart- the formerly solid and uncracked cover absolutely disintegrated in my hands.  My guess is UV damage from being in the sun.  Wanting to continue to protect my lights, I learned about the clear covers, and promptly bought a pair.  They are very slick, but i see two problems right off the bat- I am a little concerned that they are much less securely mounted, with four corner clips instead of the 360 wrap around lip on the black and whites, and a related issue is that being a flat piece of plastic up against the light, its obvious that there will be problems with dirt and water both getting trapped between the shield and the light. So while i am excited about being able to use the shields with the lights on while driving, its clear that they will bear watching and regular cleaning to get the full effect of the lights.  And i've decided to get another pair of the B&W covers, despite my prior experience, to fully protect the lights in the snowy off season when they are not being used regularly; i'm hoping that maybe with regular applications of Armorall, or 303 Protectant, the new pair will outlast the old ones.
B003G0U678|4|These fit pretty well.  Little bit of wiggle room from front to back but keeps my barn muck out of reach of the carpet and easy to clean.
B00FV1MNIU|5|Awesome thanks
B000AP8ETY|4|Quick and easy installation.  I don't pay close enough attention to the MPG to say if this had a difference overall on my bike.
B00OU0TSHW|5|It does not for perfectly into the shape of the window, however the holes line up perfectly with the mounting brackets. Incredibly easy to install, comes tinted, and is unbelievably cheap.
B00I09YW0C|4|All good!
B008H5UAY6|3|Advertise the product was nut good you get what you pay for.
B000E289B6|5|What else can you say!  It's a K&N!  I put it on my Honda Rancher and can tell that it breathes easier and is more responsive.
B0009IQZPW|3|Old cotton hand towel does the same. It's OK but I wouldn't buy it again.
B001FAI8GM|4|They fit good the one on the passenger side was slightly tilting. But okay.
B0016GRTVU|2|It broke after a few good snows after removing snow from the top of the car.  There may be some better products out there.
B0072O34S2|4|Priced right, but I'm still searching for the perfect back cushion, one that is made for my back.  Usually, I'll use a small pillow to get the right firmness.  I even went so far as to open the stitching on a pillow, and remove some material, just to get the right support.
B00EQ9FSEO|5|Perfect fit for any of my motorcycles, Bandit 1250, Speed Triple, Hayabusa.  It was easy to assemble, is very adjustable once placed on the bike and does a fine job of keeping the wind from trying to pull my helmet and head off.
B003ZCF6VS|3|I love he saying but the stickers (they are not decals) were not cut straight and look rather obvious on the mirror.
B002OIBRCQ|5|I've had this polisher for two boating seasons...it is incredible. Is it a commericial one, no, but it's as close as you need if you are doing any boat under 65 feet in length. I've used it on my car, truck, motorcycle and boats. It doesnt burn or make swirl marks. I compounded and waxed my boat in september of 2010. It was mistakenly not shrink wrapped at the boat yard (yeh I was about it too)....however, I rinsed the boat off and this polisher applied the wax so well that is looks like it did when I bought it there. It is a bit heavy, but what do you expect, its high quality. It's nice having the two different handles as I switch them when doing different parts of the boat. Your vessel will look as though it was professionally done if you follow the directions and use a quality compound and wax. It's dual action which makes it nearly impossible to swirl the job, as many do if they are using a Mikita or other professional system as they are difficult to use if you don't know what you're doing. It's gonna look good because that's what this is, a professional tool at a reasonable price. I didnt get mine from Amazon, I paid $160 for it and it's worth every penny and more. It will make quick work of any job and the cord is incredibly long which is awesome. Enough....buy this one, you won't regret it.
B000EDOSNI|5|item was as described
B009OFC2XK|1|Does not fit
B000C4NN4E|4|Had to buy a special tool to install into pump, had to pull pump apart and remove relief valve then had to bring to welding shop to stake the pickup into the pump so it doesn't fall off. You would think Chevy would update how their pumps were designed by now...
B000C5SGHC|5|It is OEM for my Toyota Rav4. I replaced the burned one and this new piece of equipment engaged beautifully. No more annoying &#34;Check Engine&#34; error
B000LNSJ7W|4|I needed an oil can I could dump my gallon of WD-40 (gallons are much more economical) for use in my shop.  I really wanted one of the old time single &#34;point & click&#34; oil cans, as they only have one moving part, just cound not locate one.  This one looks to be of pretty good design..  WIll give re-assessment aft it has some miles on it..
B001LQVP7O|4|The locking pin I ordered arrivied in a timely manner. It seems to do the job that it was designed to do, but I haven't really tested it out on the road yet.
B005B0SC0O|1|This is the worse quality seatbelt cover I've ever owned. It is made of cheat material and it just feels cheap but it does the job. If your upgrading to look nice with good quality you want to stay away from this. Looks like come just bought a regular black seatbelt cover and etched on a logo. Pathetic but it was cheap so I will keep it as it will cost more and waste my time shipping something like this back. I don't see it lasting more than 2 months at most.
B005FQGERM|5|I have an old Aladdin mug from many years ago. I love it because it holds 34 oz of coffee. But The lid is badly cracked, and I have been nursing it so I could keep using the mug. I was so happy when I found these mugs on Amazon!!! I was concerned about the height of these new mugs, wondering if they would be the same size as my Aladdin mug, but I found no size details before buying them. My old Aladdin mug was barely able to fit into my microwave (I like my coffee HOT!) because it was so tall, and I was worried the new mugs might be taller, and therefore not fit into my microwave. But I was pleasantly surprised to see the mug (with the lid off), was the same height as my Aladdin! The lid is taller than my old lid, but no worries there.       I like the design of the lid on the new mug better than my old one. First, there is no straw hole, and I hated the hole because it allowed steam to escape from my coffee. Second, it is shaped better for sipping, and I think the materials are of better quality, so it probably won't crack on me.   I bought 2 mugs, because I sometimes would forget and leave my mug at work. The next day, I would have to use a smaller mug (less coffee). Now I have a backup mug!  These new mugs keep my coffee hotter, longer, than my old one. I used to have to reheat my coffee one or two times before I finished it. With the new ones, I have hot coffee down to the last drop!   One thing I don't like about the new mugs, is the inside of the handle area is not as smooth as my old one. It is flat, with a straight edge, where the old one was curved with no straight edges. It's not the end of the world, though. I drink my coffee in the car on my way to work, and I find that sometimes I put the mug down on my leg, because it's not comfortable with the weight of the mug when it's full. But again, that's not a deal killer for me.   I highly recommend this product! I just wish I had a better choice of colors. I picked black because I hated the other colors.
B001CA9GZM|5|Perfect fit in my Pt Cruiser and is still working just fine.  I bought a sure fit at a local auto supply store and it was suppose to lock open if the engine were to over heat so damage to engine would not occor.  It locked open alright about 3 months later and not because of engine troubles but because it just decided to lock open, which didn't help when I needed heat.  This one is a standard thermostat for 195 degrees and it works just fine.
B00B25JZJO|5|Fit nicely!
B00062YJ6S|5|Everytime I get a new car I put one of these in them. Performance is better, so is mileage. Different results per car(the escort was the best)
B0000AY69V|4|the absorber is exactly what I was looking for and I gave one to a friend as a gift for Christmas
B001BU85O6|2|Work okay, the light emitted is more to the bluish side of things - not white.  All said, i would stick with standard bulbs or another option, unless of course you want the blue light.
B000BQ08BE|4|I own an 89 Dodge Dakota and I am very pleased with my purchase. The color blue is the perfect addition under the hood.
B0013RLL1G|4|These don't fall off like ducttape.
B000BWAPQ6|5|This product is the bomb yo!!! lmao... no really I needed it for my scooter and it runs smoothly now
B0072KKNBM|5|really love this stuff, kinda expensive though
B000CCFZK6|1|It would help tremendously to know if any of the headers have equal length tubing.  Some of the sellers listing headers talk all around one of the most important feature of the part.  If the headers are \\"tuned\\" then the tubes leading off of the flange(s) should all be the same length to faciliate scavenging action leading into the tubing collectors.  No one is mentioning this important feature and I won't buy this product without that claim.  I hope the headers shipped to customers are better looking than the ones pictured; for the asking price I would expect better workmanship.
B008OIH1X4|1|Paid way too much cost and shipping for a cheap product. Was expecting a stronger material and better hook. It's velcrow - lame
B0016OO4RO|2|The edges of this product do not &#34;hug&#34; the carpet.  They leave a lot of space that water or mud could drip into.  I returned them and got weathertech instead.  The weathertech floormats are significantly better in terms of fit and looks.  The vehicle I tried these in was a 2005 Mercury Montego, which has the same floor as the Ford Five Hundred and Ford Flex.
B00D953ULE|5|Great price for these...work perfect.
B00BR2EO9I|4|Works as described.  I have a '15 Forester XT, which has the same dimensions as the '14.  This is a nice addition to the trunk.
B00BMUA0IE|5|I didn't mount yet the the front one. The rest of them fitted perfectly.It took some time to clean the old adhesive for the rear one.<br />Be sure to use a heat gun to take the old one out.It looks awesome.If you go to a Hyundai dealer it would cost few hundred- my guess.
B00S4J0HFC|5|I'm just hearing about Yepal this year, but they have made some great products that are definitely multifaceted and are great for the home and your automobile.<br /><br />I used the microfiber drying towel in the home for not just kitchen needs but for dusting. This towel is priced great, and because of the size I was able to cut it into 4s and still have towels that are large enough to clean with and use for clean-ups in the kitchen.<br /><br />It feels great, and the other thing I think you will appreciate is that it's not difficult to take care of. Wash separately and let it air dry and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Definitely something that comes in handy. I think you'll easily find uses for this product around your home.
B008MISDEC|5|Was hard to find this grade....now that I have this will be the only place I will buy it from...
B000BQOV80|5|I purchased this for my F-250 with an 8 foot bed.  It took all of about 5 minutes to take it out of the box and put it on the truck.  The clamping system works very well and is easy to use.  I have driven on the Interstate with the cover down and with the cover folded up on the front of the truck.  It works very well either way.  No problems with the wind.<br /><br />I purchased this cover because I wanted to be able to keep the rain or snow off stuff in the bed.  I also wanted a cover that is easy to open and store in case I was hauling something that is too tall to go under the cover.  I have a fifth wheel RV trailer.  This cover works perfectly with my trailer.  Fold the cover down and hide the hitch and anything you may have in the bed.  Fold the cover up (no need to remove it) and you can hitch up your trailer and go.<br /><br />I was tempted to purchase the hard cover instead of this one but now that I have it I'm glad that I got this one.  Because it is covered with fabric it doesn't look like a folding cover.  It really makes the truck look stylist.
B005FKMUQW|5|excellent quality.
B00IK025M8|5|Fast shipping quality is goid
B00BCRM9YA|3|for the price. not bad
B000C9IUDI|5|Looked to be well made.  Not a lot of miles yet, but so far, so good.
B000VKODIO|5|Great product.  Arrived quickly.  As advertised.  Thanks!!
B002JBDH26|1|I had a mechanic try to install this for me. He couldn't get it to work and fit correctly. So I ordered an OEM one from a website for around $60. The new one he said fit right in there and there were no problems. As it stands I am now one day late in returning this one to the seller so I guess I have learned to start buying OEM parts even if they are more expensive. I'm sure some of these might fit but don't waste your time.
B007JMP4JE|4|Great looking kit. Haven't used it yet. But after i do ill re-rate it. But til then its every bit of useful at the moment.
B0030CUS52|2|Another  cheapie from China, The manual (which is just a single piece of paper) says it has an LED Flashlight in it and you can insert batteries to use it, but I could not figure out how to open the reflector from where I can insert batteries. The plastic reflector inside seems to have attached to something inside and it would not come out. If you just want to have a screw driver handy then its fine. Otherwise its junk
B000IY9T1O|5|Got this for my 2007 Mazda 3 GS (Canadian model) hatchback. Really easy to replace and what a difference. Ride is stiffer than before, can't say if it's stiffer than brand new OEM shocks though as I've never felt those. I drive sports car though so I don't really care. I wouldn't say that it is really stiff like sport suspension though. I'm pretty sure the stiffness is appropriate for brand new economy shocks. I've always trusted KYB for OEM replacement suspension shocks and struts and these ones did not disappoint.
B003AOPMNI|1|Pure garbage, replaced the originals after 10 years these lasted about 2000 hwy miles, REALLY thats about it. They are so bad now my Jeep is scarey to drive on the hwy. I have a set of Mopar bushings and will replace them VERY soon. They do have a 3yr warranty, but not sure it's worth it to send them back.
B001RKH7FS|1|Does not keep items cold.
B007P4V7A6|5|I ordered this but made an error when I ordered 2. I didn't realize that was 2 pair. Thank goodness the customer service sent me an email and let me know. I corrected the quantity and it was a perfect fit in my van. Thanks !
B001EYAL2I|1|$900 for a 2.5 &#34; pallet kit make this $400 and make the 4&#34; pallet kit $900 its crazy if you lower the price jeep owners would jump all over this including me
B001RB8E5O|3|Images of the \\"White Tree of Gondor\\" logo were among the most under-exploited of all the LotR merchandising that followed from Peter Jackson's wonderful adaptations.  This is one of the few and at least the best of the vinyl car decal stickers I've seen, so I give it three stars.  It could have gotten five, but there's one rather glaring flaw.  The White Tree is not depicted in white!  In creating the logo, Graphic-FX chose to represent the tree as a cutaway inside a coloured background.  The white (as seen here) and black backgrounds are the only ones that are bearable, while all the others (yellow, red, blue, green, pink????) are useless with the colorless cutaway design.  They only needed one design - a black background with a white tree - the one that Tolkien actually described.  The logo itself is very elegant (kudos to Weta again), but Graphic-FX rather missed the point of the White Tree of Gondor.
B001DCH33G|5|Very Easy install, fit perfectly. Now my hatch opens! I should have done this very easy fix much much much sooner
B00D6MO898|5|Worked on my 2010 MB C300 happy happy happy wish I new I needed these when buying the hid's 10000k
B005TY2CJO|5|Good item.. just what I expected
B001122SZQ|5|Excellent product and surely keeps you warm.
B00HE8P6AK|1|It said that it would fit my 2011 Toyota Corolla, but the holes don't line up with the mounts on the window.
B00CW5IR24|3|These &#34;Seat Covers&#34; are in desperate need of a strap to hold it in place.  They bunch up underneath you as you sit down.  We tried to cram them into the seat corners where the cushions meet, but they only come out.  Once you get it adjusted (pulling and tugging and even having someone to hold the towel in place while you sit down) they seem to be okay.
B00BXPT3Q8|5|This keychain was a gift for a neighbor who has a vintage Mercury Monterey - she LOVED it!
B007HRX62S|5|This product is useful for a lot of sealing problems. Best thing I use to maintaine all the seal on all the items on the roof of my RV.
B00MOTV6Z8|2|Looks great if u stay<br /><br />I'm trying to keepi with thus<br /><br />Zof the history of his life.
B008AN36H8|4|A little more blue tint then expected but not too much, recommend it!
B001XCBCQK|4|It was easy to assemble and put into place in the back of my 2007 Saturn Vue. My only concern is I can't seem to get it sturdy enough. You have to stretch out the vertical bars as much as you can while trying to tighten them into place. It has fallen numerous times on top of my 2 big dogs, just from them bumping the bottom bars. When it does stay in place it is great. My dogs don't even make an attempt to get past it, I can't even tell they're back there.
B0006H938M|3|I got mine in 3 days which is quick ship everything fine except when I flush, water tend to splash out so it wet the floor..wish they had it made flush lower...
B00KLFFNQK|5|Just installed and it seems to work perfectly. I was worried when I purchased it since it was so much cheaper, but so far that does not seem to be problem with the lower price point.
B000C2WL4O|5|The belt is usual Gates quality, top shelf for the most part. The set I ordered had been on the shelf for years. One of the belts was on the shelf for 6 years, it was dry and somewhat harder than a new stock belt. Amazon resent order and just one belt was within 6 months of manufacture, the other was over 6 years old and expired, again. Gates told me belt life is 6 years on the car or shelf. Makes perfect sense after handling the older belt.
B003S8CD10|5|Product worked great- had it programmed to my car by a lock smith. I am pleased with this product and transaction.
B000NGP9HU|5|Perfect fit.
B002J7VX4Y|5|I have used many different products that make the scent too powerful or doesn't smell like new car. This smells like a new car. I used this on a GTI I am restoring it. Previous owner stained everything and the smell was horrid. I used Folex to remove the stains but it did nothing to the faint odor. This did the trick I steam cleaned the interior once more and while drying sprayed a light coat of this scent over the interior. Perfect pleasant scent thank you when I run out or need another scent will be going here Thanks Chemical Guys.
B004I6HOQA|5|Replaced the old helmet speakers with these-- what a difference! Can't believe the bass I get from them. I use an Asus amplifier inline and the sound from these speakers is great even when on the highway. A bit pricey but worth it if you want quality.
B000C7TU8E|1|We bought a new radiator from amazon.com -- a Spectra Premium CU2307. Installed it, drove around the neighborhood, and everything seemed okay, so I drove it about 30 miles. Then, just as I was parking, a couple ounces of transmission fluid suddenly spilled out. The transmission dipstick was very hot!<br /><br />After leaving it parked for 3 hours we added transmission fluid back to the appropriate dipstick level before driving it again. At first it slipped badly in reverse but worked okay in all forward gears. After 2 or 3 more attempts reverse no longer worked at all, and it slipped in all gears.<br /><br />We discovered that the new Spectra Premium radiator's transmission cooler passage was obstructed so that no transmission fluid was getting to the cooler.  The pressure had forced the override vent normally intended to open only in freezing weather. Amazon sent us another radiator whose passage isn't blocked. But now my transmission needs to be rebuilt -- a $3,600.00 job!<br /><br />The response from Amazon customer service was disappointing. They sent me a free replacement radiator, but refused to consider compensating me for any part of the $3,600 damage caused by their defective product!  ;-(
B000MQ6BAU|5|Works Great with the new sprockets on the wife's CM400A.
B00155237W|5|Good.
B000M5WT16|2|I suppose this worked about as good as could be expected, but it didn't get the job done before the the teeth started breaking. The condenser on my air conditioner has about 15 fins per inch and they were flattened by hail. About the only method that seems to work is picking them back up one by one with a grapefruit knife!
B00008BKX5|5|I love this bed extender! I have used it to carry my canoe in the bed of my truck and above my truck on longer drives. Both positions work really well. It's pretty durable and has a pretty good range of adjustments for different heights. My only complaint would be that it sits a little loose in the hitch receiver, but once everything is strapped down, it's all secure. It's not going anywhere. The locking pins that are included are good, but I replaced them with the locking kind, so I don't come back from the water to find that someone needed my canoe rack more than me. Works great for lumber too. I would definitely recommend this to other people, and already have several times.
B00AZNXOZ0|4|Good sized bags for the price. I can easily fit my half helmet into the bags if needed, and even managed to squeeze my girlfriends 3/4 helmet into one (size small). I bought them for my '06 Night Train and being throw overs they easily fit, though I would recommend some saddle bag supports. I rigged up a temporary support system with small 'c' clamps until I got some, otherwise they will rub on your wheels and/or your belt and rotors. Also, I would like to see more pocket room on the inside, there is only one small pocket on the inside big enough to hold a phone or something similar. But they held up well on a ride an hour away and back, stuffed with laptops (one in each bag) and a heavy leather jacket and room for a little more.
B0035X7HPK|5|Fits my husbands truck perfectly. (2000 F-150) no issue with the key hole, he did not have one prior to ordering this item.
B007JSGR9Y|1|Mine didn,t work on my 2001 Town & Country.  I called manufacturer and they told me this was<br />not their product, and never have made this model.  They receive calls about these black market<br />items and can only say &#34;Buyer Beware&#34; and are sorry that it gives them a bad reputation.<br /><br />I missed the 30 day window to return the item, so I'm just out of luck.
B000NZQD26|5|Baja is single-handedly the BEST company to buy a bike from i have to older baja bikes and they run and sturt GREAT.
B002K6M7DA|1|I needed d2s not d2c i didn't fit
B00120H7XK|2|They leave a gap all the way around the edge so stuff can easily get spilled along the sides between the edge of mat and the carpet. They are light weight and more around a lot. They also are wearing fast. I already have a hold worn through the drivers side and my car is only 2 years old. Not happy at all. Wish I would have gone with the factory upgrade heavy solid rubber mats.
B00BP2BOPC|5|Great Product! Would recommend for license plate or car interior. Makes huge difference.
B00755JMYS|4|Met my expectations as far as brightness, but 1 was DOA and 2 others failed within a month.The others aren't bad, haven't shown any signs of failure as far as i can tell. For how cheap these were, I can't complain.
B004BCCAZ6|5|great
B00CEKLS8C|5|Absolutely love these pink bowties! I added these to my lemonade color 2013 Chevy Spark, and everyone thinks I spent a lot of money to get my car custom yellow and pink! If you lay them correctly, which took me a couple tries to get them perfectly flat without any air bubbles, they look professionally done and like you spent 100+ on custom bowties. They even come with an extra pair if you somehow destroy them, but a year later and mine still look brand new. 5 stars from me, because these went above and beyond my expectations and look high quality AND super cute.
B007RKNAEY|1|The chrome separated when pulling it off backing
B005EYQESY|5|These wheel locks are absolutely amazing; the quality is top-notch and they are MADE IN USA. Fit my 2014 Fiat 500 Abarth perfectly.
B00F8FT5C6|5|Worked great.
B00MKAXHOY|5|Excellent
B001O0TZ7E|4|OEM pads going on 95k miles and just started squeaking. Easy installation. Honestly this maintenance can be done by entry level DIY'ers. The brackets for the front brake calipers were *not* included. Make sure the buy the OE brackets from Subaru before diving into the brake job. Most local shops will not carry these and it will have to be ordered. Very happy with the initial braking performance, even before the pads are fully bedded in. Will buy again for my other vehicles when the time comes.<br /><br />One star reduction based on brackets not being provided.
B006OQBC0G|5|Perfect fit for my Mazda.  Quality product and very Quick delivery.  A must have item to pass the Virginia state inspection.
B001C8BWF6|5|I love them
B00GWF7KGO|5|Excellent
B000BQK5YY|1|Pros: It's long, that's it<br /><br />Cons: Scraper is awful. Bar is flimsy. Twist part to hold length doesn't hold well.<br /><br />Clearly, the manucfacturer had one though: spend the least amount possible
B00ASSF7XY|5|Good little lights. Great for use in a dash Nice and green too. I have had no failures. I love LEDS low poeer draw and long life.
B000CB2YBK|5|fit 1999.5 tdi jetta ALH Engine
B0055FFMGM|4|I wish there were more feminine designs. Some softer color for the ladies. The fit is wonderful and the bands are very versatile.
B00418RSF2|5|This face decal of Mickey is on my camper window. Looks fantastic. went on fast and easy.
B00D42AFS8|1|The video I saw for this item shows that it will take a car that a totally dead car battey and get it to start without even trying to  using a key. Neither of these expectations happened, it does a decent job as a portable power source to plug my phone in. (although its way overpriced if that is all can I can use it for  I was really exceited by how small and well designed it was in the end disappointed i didnt choose the larger jump starting devices made from other companies. I also think I shorted the radio using this..
B000BUU5XQ|5|These were perfect for our small camper (16ft) We were using pieces of wood.  These work much better and much more lighter.  Easy to clean .
B004KEFD8Q|2|des not fit in between the fuel pump housing on the tank and the fittings. I had to break off the nipples on the old one. the use the tool!
B006ZBABT8|5|Based on an online recommendation, I bought this to remove a mirror from our bathroom. Took me a bit to get the wire behind the mirror with a little digging on a corner, but once I got going, this wire did the trick. Removed the entire bathroom mirror from the wall in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Great product, works well.
B001T3Y8XW|5|cheap, but works just fine
B0007ZLCG4|1|When i first got the screw bit set, i opened it up, grabbed the first bit, put it in my screwdriver and tried to undo a screw. Just then, I heard a loud crack. Next thing I know,I'm laying on the ground, seering pain in my left eye. As it turns out, the bit spontaniously combusted, causing a large chunk of the bit to fly right in my eye. I then spent the next 4 hours in a waiting room, bleeding down my face, all because i wanted to undo one high security screw. I would recommend getting a different bit set, or risk losing eye sight in one eye forever.
B00A9T28S4|4|worked pretty good.
B006P888VY|5|Looks great.
B000BZJ9Q0|5|Worked perfect.....
B002R4V2TU|5|Purchased both PUTCO and PIAA bulds for my family of cars (3 Jeeps and 1 Altima).  There were no noticable differences between the quality workmanship of the 4 times the price PIAA bulbs versus the lower cost PUTCO bulbs.  And as for the look and output of the bulbs, there was no difference to the naked eye.  I suppose using some specrometer might find a measured difference.  But for the cost, I would continue to purchase PUTCO bulbs and use the great savings to fill my tank with gas.
B00P0YC6KS|5|Very happy with this pack. Doesn't move around on the back at all. Put in on an after a few minutes I forget its there. Its not much bigger than the A3 (I have both), but holds a liter more of liquid and has A LOT more storage. Don't expect to carry any bulky items though, this bag is designed to stay close to your back and be low profile. With that in mind, there is lots of room for tools, pump, spare tube, a bag of trail mix, a few bananas, phone, etc. You aren't fitting a jacket in there (maybe a spare t shirt), but then again Leatt/USWE have bigger bags to accommodate. Its perfect for a longer ride where I need lots of water and lots of snacks. The bladder itself is quality. Easy to wash, the quick disconnect is a great feature, and the bite valve works well. Can't recommend this bag enough.
B0062IJP32|5|Excellent product, I do recommend &#34;Lock Tite&#34; or thread locks liquid on all part to prevent loosing from vehicles vibrations and or the winds friction.  Good hinged door, mechanical lock great to secure your vehicle fuel & investment.
B00L84EKI0|5|This product is a life saver.  Dealer torqued the old plastic housing too tight and cracked it, got a replacement made of aluminum and this fits perfectly on it for easy oil changes...finally.
B00AJTHG4A|5|Got this for our generator replacing the acked old one. Shipping is high for a gasket.
B00C9FKXQ0|3|Gauge is find and appears to function well. Instruction for installation are very poor and Depo Racing.usa doesn't answer request for customer support or contact. I would purchase AEM next time.
B007ED9YSU|2|Used for 2 hours buffing my boat and it already has a rip in the elastic that holds in onto the buffer!
B0042ORWNI|4|Identical to the Ford OEM actuator without the Ford price!
B0033WNJBO|4|This was such an easy install on my 2013 outback. Took longer to get all my tools together then the install. I also towed about 2500lbs over 2600 miles it is sturdy and ready for anything!
B00MKM6R26|5|Very cool! Love it!
B00CMFF1AA|5|They work great! They put out plenty of light.
B008I6K7VA|5|Works great thank you ! Saved me alot of money .
B001QVEB8O|1|Garbage didn't last 6 months, never again, poor product
B000F10S60|5|Purchased this for my 06 Mustang.  Its a great product and fits well.  No windshield glare like some fabrics.
B00EDFYPF4|2|These suck! they didn't last about 3 or 4 months and there faded to a brownish white color
B0030MYBNM|4|Fits snugly and looks very nice too. I putt hoisin my 04 Dakota to replace my worn out cover. The mesh sides are a good grip but the texture of them took some time to get used to.
B000CI3RAU|4|Great OEM replacement
B00567VRTA|1|i had purchased these because they were cheap and well.. they werent that long. wires were super crappy. they dont mount good enough nd they droop they suck
B00FKGNP2Y|4|Simple, easy to follow instructions.  Kit includes plenty of material to repair a several chips.
B0002UNOYM|5|yeah...
B001GH1PU0|4|Wish there had been a note about needing a key to remove switch from mount.
B00D8RYGOI|3|Very bright for the price, haven't had it in the rain yet, so can't comm the waterproof part yet, but the problem I had was the end caps are a cast aluminum or pot metal of some sort, and the &#34;cast in&#34; mounting hole in 1 of them did not have very good threads, used a tap to cut new threads then was ready to go.
B00PBO0DCK|2|size was off
B00AZLZBN0|2|The set is really nice and I'm sure it looks good, however I bought this set because reviews on others said the radiator hose didn't fit. Well same problem here. Didnt try the other ones but seemed to be the only problem
B000GV4ZNQ|5|beautiful
B005BNP7YU|4|I really like this item. I own a 2012 Ram 1500, but the wires aren't long enough to reach my trailer plug. Over all good product.
B00029XH36|5|My son loves to play with it
B00998D5G0|5|Very good.
B0009TAOGM|5|Not much to say about a 2 5/16&#34; trailer ball with a 1 /14&#34; shank.  It's a trailer ball as described.
B000CMHVJO|5|Wow... great idea. Gives you one hand operation and makes lifting and opening your tail gate a lot nicer. Buy It and see.
B002M3KSK0|4|These crossbars fit well on my 2011 Nissan Rogue. The rails are curved so these slipped a little when I put them on. I found a piece of black sticky back rubber that I had at home and just cut a small rectangular piece to make the grips fit better on the rails. Worked like a charm and doesn't budge now. My Thule kayak carriers fit perfect on the crossbars. Happy with this purchase, very inexpensive for the quality.
B002WCWHYQ|5|What you see is what you get. No surprises they look as intended. I bought a handful of these in varying colors and they look nice.
B003PDUHF2|2|inside deminsions was to large I had to use one roll of black type wrap around on each grip to to get to proper size, at least it lessened the vibration I own a 2015 klr650
B0029TQDLA|5|Thank you for the prompt delivery, The protective plastic holders are durable, were to my expectation. I put to use immediately once I received.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone who would like to order!!!!!<br /><br />M.H.
B0007WP542|5|Easy to install/Remove, looks good, and very functional.  What more could you ask for? <br /> <br />I have had the Lund Tri-fold on my 06 Dakota for 6 months now and I would purchase this product again. Amazons price was far below any other retailer I could find so if you are looking for a soft Tonneau that can be easily removed and installed again this is your best bet.
B0028LHK02|5|good looking item,,,worked out for me,,but did have to custom mount since existing hardware would not work on my 2003 bmw 540i m sport
B003A8D6YG|5|I use this to hold up a tissue box on my dashboard since I have bad allergies. Works perfectly and you can't see it underneath the tissue box. Exactly why I wanted it.
B001KSARRM|5|happy with product ,fit perfect looked like gm quality. no problems after install . has been in vehicle for a month with no problems at all
B002XA0ZJQ|5|gift
B0000DKXMX|1|Put it together first load one crank with one yard or mulch the bracket snapped. We will see how easy it is to get that covered.... To be continued so not sure about this thing
B000CESEZM|5|Pan didnt fit. I felt it would fit but didnt. It would clear the oil pump up front. My bad lmao    Steve Dupree
B000PF1PFE|5|works well
B000A2N7K8|3|This thermometer is much too sensitive. When the sun shines on it the temperature increases 20 degrees. If you keep it out of the sun it would probably work fine.
B008XNRUYK|5|As it turned out it wasn't the one I needed for my car.  But, it works great and very high quality.  Won't melt like my original connector.  I modified my connectors to use these and they are better than the original made for my car.
B000C5PZP8|5|It's a simple task: connect two points with a wire. They set works They appear to be good quality. They were offered at a good price. Bonus--I believe I paid no shipping charges because I bought some other products from Amazon.
B00AZKQQJ4|5|They worked great
B001QXRPUI|5|This stuff did a great job cleaning some dirty leather shoes.  I was impressed.  Seems to also provide some lubrication of the leather too.  Will buy again.
B0044AZ44O|5|Excellent produts
B001DCH33G|5|We are very pleased with this product. With the help of the instruction videos we received , my husband was able to replace the tailgate lift supports with ease. Much, much cheaper than the dealership wanted for the exact same thing.
B000VUASMY|5|Fit my Ram shortbed just fine.
B009GIP3Q8|4|good quality thanks
B000CPCBF0|5|This is the first time I've used Redline oil and so far I'm satisfied.  I filled my 1997 4runner transfer case, rear differential, and front differential with this very oil and in 10000 miles and a year and a half I have had no problems.
B000BLJI74|5|Easy install just as advertised.  Sturdy steps and look good too.
B007AJG7WO|5|Works great.
B0001UZUW2|1|I bought this on a whim, and it does not work. It just cannot shoot the plastic disc straight enough, it always curves in flight and misses the fly! Not worth the money, no matter how inexpensive...Extremely aggravating to spend an hour trying to shoot a fly and missing a hundred times.
B00008RW9U|5|Works as expected, based on the product description.<br />Using on  a Bordeaux Reserve (Dark Red) Ford Fusion and it eliminates the need for 1 or 2 washings and still keep the car looking great.
B00DMYAM4U|4|What can I say. Its a simple product and easy to apply.
B000GPRFT8|1|This item came up when i searched for convoluted tubing for electrical wires, the plastic type. this had the diameter i wanted, but the description did not say what material it was made of. IT IS STEEL TUBING, like for exhaust pipes. How about adding the descriptive term STEEL to the item's description.
B000TQBSC4|4|Great product.  Used it before in previous truck and bought it immediately after I got a new car.  Easy to install and clean.
B002MB594M|5|While this product certainly is intended for cars, it works great for me in the office to make sure people don't sneak up on me. I have a few of these around my space and am alerted of movements behind me. Gone are the days of heart attacks and quickly hiding windows.
B0002KKIXC|5|Best ever! Works when nothing else does!
B000C5CE5M|1|Mine failed within 2 months. It failed open, but it failed. Buy a normal one and watch your gauges.<br /><br />Pros Fails open<br />Cons Fails often
B000HCYO1W|4|Installed this two years ago. The adhesive failed the first year, but after using clear gorilla glue to reconnect it, it has worked very well ever since. The biggest benefit is the convenience of having an \\"attached\\" sunshade, very easily pulled across to cover the windshield, instead of one that has to unfolded and arranged every time it is used, and stored some way between uses.
B004FJKDP4|5|Fits my 2001 civic lx sedan and was half the cost compared to Honda Auto Parts at the dealership.
B004A9F2DM|5|I was looking for a pair of goggles that were reasonably priced and matched my Arctic cat 500 atv and they fit the bill. Good buy!
B00559K8RQ|5|Part number 08471-35801-B0 is the correct part for older models with the dimond shaped connection point underneath the plastic cap on the passanger seat. I called the seller to maek sure but was still skeptical I would recive the correct part. Well worth the money. Installed in 30 seconds.
B005FC5M60|5|Great quality, went on as expected and no air bubbles!
B0080GZAD8|5|This part fit perfectly on my '04 Jetta 15&#34; OEM wheels. If you need to replace a VW center cap for your ride, get these.
B00DX87KSQ|5|Perfect Match works like a charm very little time to install
B000GVEGV2|5|Nice clean look on the back of my new rear fender.  The LED is bright and the finish of the whole thing is nothing to be ashamed of.  I wouldn't call this a show bike but the overall effect of this light makes it look very clean.
B0019QW7GY|5|Ideal for using with my DCM0035 battery for trolling. Great price and mounts easily on the battery!
B00S8A0932|5|I need this to handle keys and mobile wile driving. Very useful...
B0079J4RKO|1|Wrong color, closer to D6 than B7
B00IAJ2MLS|5|all pieces were complete and works just fine I got it so fast,
B000B6JJUK|5|So far so good, no problems. This product works as advertised.  I used it right out of the box with no problems.
B009UODHH0|3|All of the other exhaust systems for the Ridgeline include a resonator, and now I know why. This exhaust sounds absolutely fantastic at idle and up to around 2500 rpm. Beyond that it turns into a drone. Driving on the freeway is less pleasurable, and I now notice just how much the transmission hunts for gears between 3rd and 5th at speed. On top of that, the mounting holes weren't spaced right to connect to the Catalytic convertor. It was an easy fix with a Dremel, but frustrating.<br /><br />Too big to return (from Hawaii), and too expensive to throw away, it has become a daily reminder of a poor deciscion. -But at least my wife hates it.....
B001FZNDLW|5|Used black Plastidip on it as I didn't want more chrome on my 2015 Nissan Murano.<br />Use it on a 1 1/4 Hitch with no problems.
B0046I3I8I|4|Nice fit, good price.
B003IRLESE|5|I Love this keychain it is very good quality, It is a good deal for the money, A must have for any Chuck Fan.
B009GX0KFC|5|this purchase was nice i put them on my quad and they look awesome they work very well and gives the bike a nice touch!
B000KJ465Q|5|i have looking at for a couple years,but didn't have the extra money. i do have two other strut tools but neither could do the job<br />i needed on a full size truck, so that is when i decided to buy the Branick 7400 spring strut compressor.<br />I have used it and love it so easy to use, and alot more safe to use
B0000AXNMO|5|We use this when we'll be on the road (more than 250 miles). We go to Maine every year from Florida and I do most of the driving at night when a cleaner windshield is nice to have. I mix it with distilled water and their 2 in 1 glass cleaner. While on the interstate I rarely need the windshield wipers if I clean the windshield well before heading out.
B00JU65OP6|5|Works great in Texas sun--without sunglasses.  View is very clear.  Use it all the time.
B000C1MW8K|5|Installed on 2008 Acura TL. Surpassed my expectations.
B000XQ3N64|4|Good assortment for the price.
B000182E5K|4|fine
B003O9R7LE|5|Plate looks great on my new Lexi! So much better than the dealer plate - I'd highly recommend it. Weather has not adversely affected it either.
B003T7XUE4|4|It's a good quality valve, and the other reviewer is correct that it takes longer to drain. But oh so much better than handling that hot drain plug, dropping it in the oil pan, getting the drain oil running down your arm - - well, you know the drill....<br /><br />BUT WATCH OUT!! the valve is actually too easy to open.... running over some brush or twigs could easily slap the lever to the open position and it will stay there and not spring back --  then you'd better be watching your pressure gage and carrying 4 quarts of spare oil (yeah, right).  I got a small steel hose clamp and put it on the boss of the valve just above the lever (upper part of the valve in the photo). With the hose clamp snugged down and tightened up, it is absolutely impossible to open this valve. Yes, it's one more (small) step to loosen the hose clamp in order to drain the oil, but I think it's well worth the safety precaution.<br /><br />Would have been 5 stars except for this frailty.
B00042KJQ4|3|If your jack isn't Hi-Lift it wont fit.
B000OC3Q2I|5|Excellente!!!
B000HTLQKW|5|It works, no problems
B00KH54A04|5|ok
B000KQ07E8|4|Very pleased with the produc. The company also handles their business  very professionaly I would recommend weathertech to anyone I know.
B002ONTBMO|5|I think this is a great product. Much cheaper on Amazon than other marine goods sites. I put this in a marine themed gift basket for my husband and he is very proud to display on his truck
B001D5UBWS|5|Fit perfect
B003I3XI9Q|5|Great stuff easy install and fast shipping!!
B007DBVS8C|5|If you are in need of these I recommend these ones here. They are 20 dollars cheaper then I could find them anywhere else. They also shipped fast. Now I will admit I had a little difficulty installing them because it seemed like they wouldn't fit. I saw a phone number on a little blue sticker on them and called. The customer service was great and they told me that I should hold the starboard tube they came in upside down and out popped the parts I needs. Note that if they aren't in the bottom of the starboard tube they should be in the plastic bags the shocks come in. Now my hatch back door opens up on its own.
B005I59IDM|4|Glad to have this shade, car is in FL and this shade keeps every bit of sun out, a good buy!
B004PC08K6|1|Didn't fit the Honda Fury
B000E4RYLA|4|For the price, the did handle worked great. It was easy to install and the wait for the part was a lot shorter than the expected wait time. As far as how long it will last,  only time will tell.
B003CE283I|5|Awesome product. Easy to install. Well-made. Good value. Saves a lot of time and energy vs using a standard wheel and having to take the wheel on and off. Obviously doesn't give you the same ability to roll the trailer. This is a minor issue as an unloaded trailer is not too difficult to move for most people. You can quickly remove it and use the wheel if needed.
B007ZDGMA2|5|I loved using this product, no harsh smells and did not make my hands feel nasty. It cleanedy year old salt caked boots very well, and seemed to have a lasting effect and did a really good job, I used this in conjunction with the waterproofer. It was nice the applicator pad came with the product. Of the other leather cleaners and conditioners I have used, chaimberlands is my favorite, in terms of ease to use and the fact it really does work, unlike others seem to only work on the surface of the leather. I reccomend this product to anyone with winter worn shoes.
B005HFYE1O|5|Works well, good connection between relay and harness, and this gauge wires. I used one to power on exterior LED strip lights on my vehicle with the parking lights, then another to switch LEDs of when headlights are powered on. They get the job done, no complaints on my end.
B00F47Z2J8|5|The fog lights look nice and bright even brighter then the headlight's
B00KPCHK5Q|5|perfect!! love it
B000JZDKHQ|3|I bought this because my bumper is a little too tall for my trailer...and it performs it's function. All the holes did not line up, so I couldn't fully bolt it in place with all the bolts, just the two front ones. Also, I was unable to install a hitch pin lock as the extra steel flare gets in the way, so I just use a standard pin.  I tow a trailer with ATV and my boat and no issue so far. Solidly built.
B00449KYB8|4|When I first received the product I was upset with it. It appeared to have hairline fractures, broken off pieces, and a Nissan imprint grind off. It told me that it was a refurbished or cheap replica. The pump resides inside the cover and can bee seen when flipped over. It did not have any markings signifying it being a Hitachi but it was brand new with clean oil. The overall appearance added to my anger because the mechanics who broke my original cover and messed up cam timings were Mexicans and the timing cover I received said made in Mexico not Japan. I have nothing against the good people of Mexico but things just didn't work out in either of our favor.<br /><br />To make a long story short I calmed down and took it to an engineer friend of mine for a second opinion. He told me that this cover was made from an original casting mold sold to Mexico for reproduction. That's why the Nissan imprint was shaved off. He also said that it was a very good cast and the broken off nubs were part of the molding process. The hairline fractures were also nothing to worry about either because it was on the surface and did nothing to weaken the integrity of the cover.<br /><br />After I took the old cover off to compare with the new I discovered that it was the same thing. Made in Mexico except the Nissan imprint was still there. After further inspection of the entire vehicle I noticed allot of it was assembled in Mexico. That brought relief to know parts were original and not knock offs. I reset the cam timing and put the new cover back on and everything works like a champ.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this part over American made replicas. Everything is original on it and Hitachi is OEM for many of the Sentra parts. It's direct fit and good quality. Also Amazon price beats the the overpriced aftermarket junk found elsewhere.
B002307OLS|3|It fits loosely even though my husband has a bigger size head and much thinner than what I expected.  Overall, not what I expected.
B0067O6322|5|Very good quality,(megan racing)fully adjustable all the way around, Company answered my questions about the product when I asked as well. Got to my house in about 4 days considering it was from the other end of the continent
B000GZOIM0|5|This headlight from Bikers Choice was good quality and has a halogen lamp.  No wiring diagram, no problems[[ASIN:B000WK9IYC Bikers Choice 6-1/2in. Springer Headlight - 12V 160314]]
B00IWY3KCG|5|auto parts avenue/ thank you, thank you. the Z headlight is just what I was looking for. and its the correct side. perfect.
B003P9SU5K|5|Perfect fit. Works fine.
B003DNL8ZC|4|worked as advertised.  covered my 2005 Impala with no problems.
B00496JLW4|5|Filters the air and fits my vehicle.  That's all I can really expect and it does it nicely.
B00C2S7G9G|5|Well made.  Bought a set for the front and one for the back and they look great on my new Murano Cross Cabriolet.  A little more pricey, but I feel like it was worth it.
B008EEYWKI|5|Put it in my 2004 Sequoia 4X4 and everything works great after 6 months.
B00BA761DW|1|Paid for the kit, waited two weeks and got an email that the kit is no longer being made....
B00062YABC|5|Did the trick.
B0034ZMVKU|5|The cbr F3 is known for going through fuel pumps. After doing some research on the issue, I found that it was this switch in the stock pump that goes out. I purchased the switch and installed it in no time. It is an exact fitment and is a very simple and easy install. This got me riding again, thanks guys!
B00OZC19XQ|5|Awesome great quality!!!
B000K00CCG|5|Works like a charm, took out old burnt up unit. Rear defrost works great and fast.
B0002U69OY|5|If you're tired of being followed too closely by the car behind you, this sticker might help the driver behind you get a clue.  (That is if they're not too busy talking on the cellphone, drinking coffee, and/or putting on makeup.)  Fortunately, the writing seems large enough so the driver behind you won't have to drive up really close to read it.
B004OFNJZ0|5|Works great!!!!
B00HUCG1T0|4|Was pretty easy to install - although I did need a little help because it seemed Iike<br />the bolts were barely long enough. But<br />once it was on it felt very solid and looks good
B000EQR87S|5|Purchased for my 2005 Trailblazer.  Fit was perfect.  Good product.  Its ACDelco what can you say.
B000E28C6S|5|The hex top makes install and removing easy, especially since this is a chrome filter. Item shipped fast and arrived perfect.
B00ARLOD0U|5|These stickers are VERY good quality and stick perfectly! I even had to put a sticker on a second time (because I put it on crooked)and it still held perfectly! I bought a lot of these stickers so I'm just going to copy and paste this review on all the ones that I personally got. I want everyone looking to get one of these stickers to know that this is a reliable source and a great seller! I will be purchasing more very soon!
B000KIPV38|5|This Adapter fit great with the other retro fitting I purchased along with this time!!  The A/C is running cold!!  thanks!
B007TZITG6|4|It was a Christmas gift.  I think he liked it fine
B00AYA40RU|5|they fit every need of the floor i needed perfectly i will recommend these mats to everyone i know best item i have bought for my car in a while
B000BQWLE6|5|Love this item. Bought one for myself and one as a gift. Both of us love the size style and convenience for an auto.
B00AJTEERC|3|Very good products
B004YHR3JG|5|These are very nice seat covers. They are washable and easy to maintain.
B00A32AR2G|5|I got this for my laptop exterior, which is ruched aluminum, and this looks amazing on it. Simple, clean, and spot on reproduction of the logo.<br /><br />i misread the initial description so i wasn't expecting 2 decals. (bonus for me!)<br /><br />There's not a lot to review here, and it's a specific item. If you're looking for this, look no further.
B005RSUOTW|5|thanks it brought a smile in my foster dad's face he loves it very much. He lived in germany long time ago. Thanks again.<br /><br />Rosie Ulrich
B00INZ65B2|3|All went well. But I have a 2004 silverado 2500HD DIESEL I would have had to have seven (7Qty) to replace all as recomended. I did not find this out until I had it all apart. so i left the trans temp one alone.
B002YXC0A4|4|I used this on a Walmart cheapie grill to refurbish it. This is an exact fit, and almost identical to on numbered R801-080 or similar parts. The problem is that this regulator doesn't put out as much pressure, so the flame cannot get as large and hot. But, it works and I'm sure it works perfect for the grill it is designed for.
B005C5AMMO|5|Good Product.
B00PZDHSF2|4|Received item in timely manner. Great item, looks great installed. I was able to install without wiring harness. Easy install.
B007NGAV9Y|5|I purchased this vest mainly for carrying my concealed firearm while riding my motorcycle, but I also appreciate the inside pockets for carrying my cell-phone. The vest is of very high quality, with sturdy, heavy leather. I read in the reviews that it does run a little snug. I usually wear a medium, however I ordered a large, and it fits good. I would say they run a full size small, so order accordingly.<br />The only thing I would change on this vest is the single snaps on the inside pockets. I'm sure my small cell-phone would fall out, and possibly my J-frame revolver as well. My plan is to have Velcro strips added for more security. With all this said, I am still very pleased with the quality. I am sure you would have to spend a lot more to match or beat this vest in another brand.
B0041UEQG4|5|These seat covers are just as if the truck came with leather interior.I put these on a 2013 silverado extended cab and the fit was perfect. Previously I had a 2008 GMC Sierra extended cab and my wife bought seat covers for me at Christmas from GM and I thought they were a good quality product until I bought these covers. The look and feel of these compared to those are 200% better product. The only thing, is it took double the time to install them as stated as expected. Any other covers that I buy or recommend to others will be Clazzio!!
B001G7HOG4|5|It's just a blade but it's way cheaper than going to the dealer where they wanted over $20.  Keep in mind this is only the blade, not the whole wiper.
B004AFW4PK|5|Cant find them any more  & i love these  mugs .  order 4  with no problems . got the red & black ones for  the price . i lose about 1 a year
B000630AEC|5|I had read the rave reviews for these air filters and wondered about them.  I also noticed that at a very popular auto parts store one of these was going for around $50 plus tax here - that's quite a bit of money for an air filter.  But I found the same filter on AMAZON for about a third less with free shipping - so, I decided to buy this air filter from AMAZON.  Well, the results were just great: I went from getting 21.1 mpg to 24.6 mpg in my 2001 Chrysler Town and Country (it has over 160,000 miles on it) - and this filter was the only thing I changed.  Buy this filter - it really works!  The racing guys know what they are doing.  Just think - in less than 4 tanks full, this air filter pays for itself in gas savings - and from there I'm saving real money.  Before I had never thought of an air filter as being an investment - but this one is.  Plus, it's a lifetime filter - I just clean it, re-install it in my van and go. Wow!
B001ESN590|5|Ive had them for three years and they are great love them.
B007FUJTI2|5|I am in love with this key. I knew I'd like it cuz its pink but the more I use it the more I love it!!
B000R3SNJU|5|It's a great product and is well packaged with two nylon carrying cases. It came complete with all adapters needed.
B001OBD16O|5|Excellent price for a caliper. Bolted right up, bled it, and good to go. I will buy again but hopefully not for this axle.
B000AP1JUA|4|I've been using this wax for 10 years now.  I found out about it when I bought a used car from someone.  I notice the paint was so slippery nothing would stick to it.  I called the person I bought the car from and he told me about No. 845 Insulator Wax.  I bought a bottle at a local private autoparts store.  I've been using that same bottle since then.  You just need a tiny bit of this stuff to cover an average sedan.  Like another reviewer has stated, there are not cleaners in this wax so you will need to use a clay bar (if required) and a pre-wax cleaner before applying this wax.  It goes on and comes off easier than any other wax I've used.  The best thing about it is that it lasts a long-long time.  I have an old Camry wagon that I waxed with 2 coats of Insulator wax over 3 years ago and it still shows beading to this day... this is no joke... I can't believe it either and this car has never seen a garage.  This wax can also be applied on top of itself after the first coat has \\"cured\\".  The more coats the harder it is for something to stick to the surface and the longer it will last.  Over the ten years I've had this bottle, I've tried many other brands because I read about them or the package caught my eye at the store: Meguires (Gold Class, NXT, and Carnuba from the 3 step kit), Klasse, and P100S trying to find something that works better...  All I did was waste my money on some fancy packaging.  None of them compare to this wax.  I'm done trying other brands of wax as this stuff has proven itself over and over.  It just works, works for a long time, and makes the surface shine.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bottle design is poor:  The threads in the cap are easy to strip; the bottle is narrow and tall and has rounded edges on the bottle making it easy to knock over.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  Just try it and you will see for yourself.
B000BYEOHK|5|good
B0015RFIJU|5|Dodge Ramcharger uses these &#34;puck&#34; tranny mounts a long with similar Dodge trucks form this era.  4x4 only.  The 2wd ones use a more standard type of tranny mount.
B004PBCBMU|3|Not really sure if these were worth the money.... they don't really keep any mist/dirt/salt off of my car and now I just worry about backing up in deep snow.... extremely expensive for what they are.  Pretty easy to install and I assume they'll last a long time though.
B0019ICG7M|5|this is an exhaust clamp, no need for a novella of a review. if you don;t know your size, google a number, or find the website and get the right size. as far as i know shipping and customer service are good.
B007JMTS14|5|Good product.
B005545JGQ|5|This is very good quality product, probably better than OEM installed in my Forester. It feels heavy and substantial, quite tight. Made in Taiwan. One of other reviewer complained about the rubber - I think it is very solid, thicker than OEM. Unlike OEM part this has metal band at the arm and at the bolt.<br /><br />I chose this over Moog because this has castle nut as opposed to self-locking nut that is less secure.  It comes with the grease inside, no need to have a grease gun at the time of installation.<br /><br />That said I have to return it because I was able to re-grease and seal original ones and they still nice and tight. Wish OEM had metal band on top holding rubber tighter to the bolt like this does - the grease would not have escaped easy. If I ever have to replace them this will be my choice.
B004W4OHJU|1|Lows beams or set perfect driver high beams aims50ft in the air an passenger side high beam is aimed perfect
B005O52SLA|5|It meets the DOT safety rating and was offered in a size that fits my young one's head.<br />Comfortable and easy to put on and take off.<br />Butterfly design kept it very sweet.
B000YCCORQ|5|Fit perfectly. I purchased this style because it offered a flat rim at the gate area so I don't have to lift heavy items over the rim of the liner. Love it!
B0064TB0HS|4|Nice looking item. Flashy. Operation and manufacturing is above par. Leaves no question to what car you are driving around.
B000C6KKJS|5|Great air filter for the price and fit perfectly on my S10 pickup. Hopefully it will last a long time and I can worry about other things
B003Y323NC|2|Worked great for 6 months now it turns on but only reads for 10 minutes then glitches the rest of the time if it worked for more than 6mo it would be a 5 star
B007DKY6QO|5|Love this. Great quality, very pretty!!
B00ARJQKWQ|5|Like
B00139YMUQ|5|this is the best tire gauge i've ever used. very accurate and easy to use. tried several other digital gauges and this one beats them all.
B000C2ZJRU|5|Helped my YJ run a bit better and for the price why not change it out once in a while?
B004N5WHE0|5|Great value - so much better than buying it in the store! And I love this car wash. Have been using it on my car for the two years I've had it and my paint still looks like it did when the car was brand new.
B008BKLPWI|1|Not sticky at all. Lays down more like a sticker then vinyl.
B002UXBELY|5|Not true HID, but you get what you paid for, this is noticeably white light, other motorist will know you have some type of white headlights...you know for bragging right or show.  It also is more lumis at night I can see more than traditional headlamps.  Not bad at all!
B000F1QLAM|5|Came as said, perfect match(compared to stock off the car).  Never actually installed it because I left it at the hobby shop on base and it was gone the next day!
B00007E7LO|5|We use this on a 2000 Toyota Tacoma, and it is just the right size.  Not too long or too short.  The original sized club was too short but would probably work anyway.  I can't see driving any vehicle with a foot of bar sticking out the side of the steering wheel.<br /><br />This is mostly a deterrent for the amateur car thief/joy-rider as a pro would know how to defeat it.
B005NLQAHS|4|Works great after I found a app that would work for it. Tryed it on american, Japanese and  German cars. I would recommend it
B005UUI3SQ|1|This whole thing is red including the cargo light. The cargo light is also VERY dim so it's completely useless. I should have noticed it in the picture. I've already installed it so I guess I can't return it. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!
B003WSZH9G|5|I bought these ramps from Amazon's returned products warehouse (I forget what they actually call it). These had been returned and were discounted because of that. They arrived and upon taking them out of the box, I was surprised at how light they were!! Second thing that surprised me was that for being a used returned item, I couldn't tell, they were in perfect shape! They work just as they should with my Corvette so I am extremely pleased with this purchase.
B00DJDXL5Q|5|Bought this seat for distance riding and took a trip soon after I installed it on my bike. Very pleased with the comfort it added with a wider, deeper, better padded seat and a backrest. It was initially difficult to install on my Honda Shadow because it was such a tight fit but with some help, it was installed properly. I would recommend the seat as well as the retailer I bought it from who was very accommodating and quick with communication.
B001NAP2D6|4|Fast shipping good product
B001GJ3EJS|5|Works perfectly and as advertised.
B00R6XAM0C|5|This is just an ice scraper but there are some bad ones out there. This one did the job this morning. It didn't leave any skips and it glided nicely over the windshield and windows of my car. Easy to hold and very sturdy. This is backed by a 1 year warranty and that is always a good thing.
B005LXTOEY|5|Installed working in less than 2 hours but I was being extra careful (on top of lacking tools and having to improvise).  Apparently this is a frequent problem for Honda Pilots so I will try to update as to the durability of the parts.  My first attempt at car fixing was a smashing success! I ventured into fixing clogged toilets and installing sinks first :)<br /><br />Love the maker's punny name!
B00EPP21LW|5|My personal favourite lanyard. Go Joe!
B000VKVXK0|5|worked perfectly
B004GEJAPC|4|Recovering my Mazda from a front end collision.<br /><br />The item does the job.  Not sure if the material is 100% the same as original.
B00N07J6JQ|4|Love the hitch cover. Really adds to the style of the denali. It was sent out fast and delivered before the due date. If you have a denali i highly recommend this hitch cover.
B00RPO0MXE|5|Love it
B004I127DU|5|great
B000LMRSMK|3|These are the first saddlebags I've ordered.  You can adjust the drop length by unstitching the leather and gain a couple of inches of drop.  I found a few flaws in the &#34;leather&#34; and stitching with some extra holes.  It has quick release plastic clips.  Two of the four clips are troublesome to secure.<br /><br />As far as keeping them snug and not flopping in the wind, they have two long pieces of leather straps on the front and rear of each bag positioned midpoint in height on the front and rear of each bag.  I ordered &#34;Saddlebag Supports for 02+ Honda VTX1300/1800 R/S by Cavalry Customs &#34;.  The combination of these two items keeps the bags away from the rear wheel but don't keep the bags really snug.  I ended up tying on end of each string to the loop of the bags and winding them around the support brackets several times to try to keep them tight.  If the bags had a 3rd strap on the bottom in the middle of the bag to tie to middle of support bracket it would be a vast improvement.  If the support brackets had some rings welded in several locations to use as tie off points to secure the bag straps it would be an enormous improvement as the straps tend to slide to the ends of the brackets and become loose.<br /><br />Capacity of the bags was tested when I put a hooded sweatshirt and a loaf of bread in one bag, and 30 cans of beer in the other bag.<br /><br />I will probably use a micro hose clamp to secure the leather strings to the bottom middle support bar of the bracket to make the tightest fit possible.
B00N52YAOW|5|nice work
B0019I7IVQ|5|I installed this assembly on a 1997 Honda Accord LX, 4 cylinder, nonVtec, non-CA emission vehicle.<br />Bolted into place with no problems. Assembly is well made including the welds.<br /><br />The factory original piece has a bolt on lower heat shield on a section of the pipe that is removable but will not fit on this replacement due to pipe size and also the welded on hangers of the new piece are in the way.  No big deal as this lower heat shield only appears to help prevent the exhaust pipe from coming in contact with road objects.<br /><br />Be sure to get the two gaskets that you will need.  Walker 31383 and Walker 31360.
B007XC77QI|1|Ordered this after getting check engine light on 2010 Jetta Sportwagen.  Device booted up and indicated &#34;no codes.&#34;  Took car to Autozone, where codes did show up on their device, later confirmed and addressed by VW service dept.  Bottom line: this product did not work and I returned it for a refund.
B00K15OVCW|5|Works and looks great! Only complaint is the rust starting to show on the mounting studs, other than that it's awesome. Will definitely buy again.
B000CC9BGK|5|This system replaced the Gibson non stainless steel split rear  which has been on my truck for about 10 years and rusted out (yes even in Florida).  The fit was almost perfect.  I had to cut 2 pipes to make it fit properly and I did fit it with the spare tire on and trailer hitch in place. Other than that, the system is well made.  I do wish that they would use stronger clamps as I broke 2 of them.  Uses all the factory hangers.  Hardware bag includes 2 hangers for tailpipes.  It has a nice quiet throaty sound.
B00P9OEZR6|3|just ok, not the easiest to use and remove, takes a lot of elbow grease and microfiber towles. does bead nice and seems to last but it will not last one year, I can tell already.<br />this is just a protectant, not a polish or shine enhancer so do not expect your car to look any better. personally I am not going to do another application as its not worth the effort and I wax and polish by vehicles on a regular basis anyway.
B00B2B4D4A|5|This lift kit was the exact touch I was needed for my jeep wrangler. I wanted to gain some additional clearance and be able to install larger tires.<br />Install went very smoothly with no problems at all. It was easily completed with some technical know-how and a garage space to perform the work.<br />  Once install was complete the kit came out to be a 2'' lift in the rear and 2.5'' lift in the front. While the kit is advertised as a 2.5'' kit all around, I personally like the larger spacer in the front because the kit can double as a leveling kit. My jeep no longer has that nose down appearance from the factor.<br />  With the added height I can easily clear a 35'' tire on my stock 17'' wheels. There has been no problem with rubbing or bumping of the wheels. The only time you get some slight rubbing is at full turn over at the wheel, but in normal everyday driving you rarely encounter this anyways.<br />  As for off road use, the kit seems to be holding up well and with a replacement of the OEM fenders or by shaving them down, you will have plenty of room for articulation.<br />  This kit is a great buy for the money and ease of installation. There is no need to buy fancy full lift kits for such a minor lift of only 2.5''. If you want to go larger then spend big money but if you want to improve your off road ability and turn a larger tire, without breaking the bank then this is the kit for you.
B00H34F2BI|5|Very happy with my purchase.Smells great!
B00HZDJ65K|4|I often commute to work on my motorcycle and hate staring at the sun, so I had to wear sunglasses which means I had to wear my contacts. This lets me be lazy and wear my glasses and still be able to drive safely.<br /><br />The shield is about the same as wearing a pair of sunglasses, It's not too dark even if it's a cloudy day out yet dark enough to keep the sun out of your eyes when the sky is blue and the sun is shining.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey but worth it for me.
B000CPCOAM|5|Speed bleeders should come on cars from the factory.<br /><br />I had these on my first race car and they'll be on my new race car as well. These make bleeding brakes an easy, one-person job.  They are cheap and they save you time, what's not to love?<br /><br />Totally recommended.
B003YDELBE|3|cheap tool<br />the batterys were dead<br />rater cheaply made will not last beyond a month<br />is not loud enough<br />card was rather cheesey
B000BGOFA4|5|works great-and a goodd deal/ just be sure to snug the bands really tight around the mirror so its not too jittery.
B0010EBWDE|5|My Kawasaki Vulcan Drifter came with a Corbin seat but no backrest for the Mrs. this fit intto the hole from Corbin it looks very good and fits perfect. saved a bunch over Corbin good materials
B000VHL9UW|5|Received the product on time, it fits perfectly the K&N Typhoon intake on my 08 Si. Made a little test with water splash before placing it on the car and seems like it will make a little difference, wich gives me more confidence to ride my car on the tropical rainy season. Still beware of deep water on the road that scould plash into your engine bay.
B003WZXAXO|5|This tool was a life saver for me.  The nuts that hold the wiper arms on came off easily.  Not so for the the arms themselves.  After having tried everything I could think of, it was clear to me that they weren't coming off without some kind of tool.  I went to the Amazon website where I found a wide selection of tools to take on the task.  After looking at the various designs, I chose this model.  It is made of forged steel and fit perfectly under the wiper arms.  After slipping the tool under the arm and hand tightening, (you do need to get it pretty tight) the arm popped right off.  Did the same for the other one with the same result.  This tool is very strong and well built.  It did not bend at all.  I couldn't have done the job without it.  Of all the arm pullers I looked at and read about this one stands out above the rest.  It's design will most likely work on most vehicles.  I would highly recommend it.
B007XZK6UE|1|The grill they sent me is very cheap looking.  It has vertical lines instead of the crossed lines that is shown on the page.  I was very disappointed.
B00KX10Y5M|5|Looks great an is the exact length
B00HY2SE7I|5|I placed this on the front of my spa bathroom door and it looks nice. Was easy to apply and delivered as promised
B001N729FS|5|Simple and it works.  Put these on every piece of equipment you own
B0018NIF50|5|We use our Suburban for fishing trips, and wet wading boots aren't compatible with the stock carpet mats. These fit perfectly, catch all the grime, and the raised lip contains debris within the mat. Very easy to remove and clean.
B00KQ81M94|5|Great product
B001NHCFVQ|1|Not as expected. Returned.
B0046I3I8I|5|They are light and fit well.  I have not used any other covers. They are heavy duty.  The fact that you can retreat them with water seal make them last.
B001BFLXWM|5|Your car/truck was designed with a certain make/model of sparkplug in mind. You will usually get the best performance by sticking with those recommendations. Fancy multi-tip and platinum/iridium spark plugs are ways to make you part with more money.  Replacing the auto-store house brand plugs in my Toyota truck with properly-gapped plugs help cure hesitation and misfiring.
B0031I5Z6M|2|These rotors are made in China and they will rust on you after they get wet. The rotor face it self is ok, but the other part of the rotor will rust. Had I known this before I installed them, I would have painted them. Do not buy them if they are made in China.
B007KFMRUO|5|Great value, I would highly recommend
B000C9DA6K|5|Just like what u buy in the auto parts store
B002KRK6I2|5|I love this product. It is much lighter then the Astro turf that I used to bring in my RV. Great product and easy to clean and store.
B003807W1O|5|got the order just find.
B000PKX0C0|5|Great stuff. It works much better than real interior type paint especially on plastic and vinyl. Stands up to moisture and the sun.
B00JBJ6KQY|5|Awesome product
B00EW1G00W|5|Love the material that this license plate frame is made out of as it seems durable and long lasting.
B002SB04CS|5|This is exactly what it says it is .. genuine Toyota OEM tray, but for a lot less than buying it as an option with a new car. Heavy material with a raised lip to catch any water, mud or spills.
B006CSSKCO|4|This was easy to install and worked perfectly!!! I took off one star because I think the price is too high for what amounts to about 5.00 worth of parts and RadioShack.  However, I paid the extra money because I had to get the job done ASAP and didn't have time to mess around.  I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't have the skill to make it yourself (or the time) as I am an electrician and could have made this in 5 min once I had all the parts in front of me...
B0028N321Q|5|Hubby loved it and it sits on our wall in a $30 frame. Would so recommend this as decor in an car guy room.
B005NPAFPC|5|these liners fit very well and look nice also did not have any trouble putting on like some of the other reviews had indicated
B000C46MRO|5|Works well, as expected.
B001654IIS|5|Worked Great! You will need a machine shop to install it. It requires boring the jug out, and decking it when you get it in.
B002Q1IO2W|5|Very clean looking. I have the iso grips so installation was a cake walk. 30 minutes taking my time and drinking a beer ...
B000GZLU8U|1|Film is of poor quality.  Often the rolls stick and then starts to tear and becomes impossible to use or fix.
B00F8LEB9W|5|They came on time and with easy instructions. One of them does not have the range that the other has but I'm thinking of trying a fresh battery.
B005H12SZ2|5|Extremely fast shipping  all the way to Alaska thank you they look awesome and work really well these had everything you Ned down to the the atachment wire clips to Mont on the inside door panel looks great on my 2012 denali  hd duramax
B008N6BT6W|5|Shocks were  what  I  expected.  I'm  a  shopper and these guys  offered the best deal.  I love the free shipping .
B000C59WFM|5|Solid,,overweight ,, ,built  like Arnold,  performs like  a Ferrari on steroids!!  Much bigger than the cheap'os  ..stronger..<br />well built,,, balanced,,  takes the abuse!!<br />If  You have a upper end car ,, or Chrysler product  this is the only and only  quality  you can use  or  you WILL  pay the price  --real  quick!!  Moog  is  a must on Chrysler,,Lincoln,,Caddy Buick  suspensions!!<br />A  MUST!!<br /><br /> Buy on Amazon  the prices  are super ,,,Advance Auto  is  way out there  at unaffordable prices!!  Also Amazon  has a good return policy  ,, Advance  gets cute  ,  often!! I bought Autozone  Suspension parts for my Chrysler,,, big mistake.. all do not have the quality needed .

B00F242SM2|3|it's a bit smaller than I wanted.
B00VB1FXMC|5|Excellent Quality! Made in the USA! Arrived via USP before expected. Highly recommended.
B00AMLX6WG|5|I LOVE it!,everyone who's seen it has asked me where I got them from and it looks super pretty against my white car
B0019IPLCY|1|Made in the USA.  I measured resistance of the shortest wire from the set and it was ~3.8k Ohms.  My old OEM Delco wire was ~2.4k Ohms!  This SMP plug wire set would be a downgrade.  I checked some of the longer ones and same thing; more resitance than my Delco's.  Also the plugs ends were a little larger and could be a fitment issue.
B005RGMFQE|2|Unfortunately the OK button which changes the functions was faulty right from the beginning, and has to be pressed so many times to get it to work. Very frustrating and as I am not based in the USA it is cheaper to chuck it, than send it back and pay shipping for a new one back here. Very disappointing and an expensive failure
B000YCBHP6|4|The valve on the side stops to get an accurate reading and can be used for bleeding the air quickly. seems well made and better than most gauges. might buy one for each vehicle.
B00A4FX4AY|3|The paint itself is an excellent product but it should not be called a &#34;kit&#34; because it only comes with a small bottle of paint quite a contrary to the picture.
B00029XGYG|4|Followed kkromes review bought a 2 pack of the ceramic encased 1ohm 10watt resistor. I ran two in series but it didn't provide the horn with enough power so one was enough. I just crimped one end using wire butts and the other end to the lead that goes to the horn.  About a 3-5 second honk really made the resistor hot maybe like 200+ degrees (probably exaggerating) but the resistor gets hot. Also like kkromes suggested, you need to untighten the bolt behind the horn, its encased in a cap you need to remove. I had to untighten all the way until it became loose then hand tighten to finally get the ah-ooo-ga effect
B00KS40U8K|3|the pants are great, but the sizing is way off. way too small
B0083SL8VQ|4|I'd probably have given it no more than 3 stars, but it gets a 4 for the great price. It's a knock off of a Rizoma \\"reverse retro\\" mirror, and looks the part. The problems: finish is cheap...it was scratched right out of the box and scratches easily during install. Also did not include the right internal clamp adaptors for me, I had to use extra ones I had left over from different mirrors. It does not clamp quite tight enough IMO, and the mirror part itself swivels too easily with no way of tightening it permanently. I'm constantly having to re-adjust after rides. The seller was great, shipping was super fast from China (less than a week and a half). For this price I would buy it again, but the quality is def ho-hum. However they do look good and they do work.
B001FANZJ2|4|The only thing that would have made this product better is a plastic backing.  The frame looks good on the rear license plate and adds the focal point I was looking for.
B005EJGSQ2|5|Just what I was looking for.  This heated seat cushion is perfect.  Easy install, nice switch,<br />& plenty of heat.
B0031HHA7U|4|This part replaced the right rear window regulator on my 2001 Buick LeSabre.     First thing to note is that this does not include the motor so be sure to save the motor from your broken regulator. Second, the mounting holes for the motor are not threaded, unlike the holes on the factory part for my car. Consequently, you will need locking nuts, which are not included, to mount the motor if your old regulator does not have them.    Other than those two things, part fit and worked perfectly. Installation was very easy and within 15 minutes I had swapped in the new part.
B004JBQ5WS|3|I bought these thinking there was going to be four of them, so i returned them.  Also they did not fit my honda accord crosstour very well.  it says it will fit but if you see the gas tank lever cut out in the mat; my car does not have the gas tank lever there so it did not fit.
B00JV9MG08|4|I've ridden with a couple of these on my KTM 990 Adventure for the last couple of years.<br />Over 40,000 miles, including a trip through South America.<br />I mounted one on the outside of my top box lid and another hanging from the underside<br />of the lid.<br /><br />These are great for keeping organized and handy those items you need to access often.<br /><br />Max
B0002Z2MZ4|5|This stuff is amazing - leaves a non-greasy, no-shine matte surface with a light citrus fragrance that fades quickly. Just spray it on and wipe it off. Cleans windows too, so overspray onto windows is no problem. Hopefully it's got good UV protection, time will tell.
B003CUHXD2|5|The master blaster was a big hit for my husband's birthday present!  It works great on the cars, they look like new after using it on them.  There's no streaks, just a shiny finish.  We use it on all of our classic cars and there's a big difference compared to using a chamois, it cleaned a lot better.  Thanks again for the quick delivery. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good cleaning product for their cars, it works great and it's built to last.
B00BTS28I4|5|This is one of the most awesome things I got for my car. The metal frame seems solid and not likely to break and the screw holes align well without covering my registration sticker. It's money well spent on something that's definitely not cheaply made plastic! What makes it even more awesome (for me) is the fact that this license plate frame has been put on a tiny car and not a giant SUV or a Jeep!
B0076KBPNI|5|The manual doesn't specify that you need a bluetooth pin to pair up to the device, but a quick google search solved this problem.<br />The pin is 1234 and once my phone recognized the device, it worked like a charm.<br /><br />Ive used this on a 2007 Chevy Malibu, a 1997 Nissan Altima, a 2009 Subaru Outback, and a 2007 Honda CRV.<br />Every vehicle i plugged this into accepted the device.<br />Well worth the money
B001B0X00U|5|i put these in my 01 1100 shadow. the bike runs soooo much better, more power, smother.<br />I will buy these for all my vehicles.
B002Y079XK|5|Saw these in a local store for more than twice the price. I knew I wanted them and saw they were here so I got a better deal as I was making other purchases at this time too. I have a black 2014 Mustang 5.0 GT/CS and I put these in the back seat below the small windows. They fit nicely in the panels. Without these the back seats look too plain. It's a really great looking detail for a very small price.
B000WKHFX8|4|At $160 it's not exactly cheap for what it is and the shipping was a bit slow but..<br /><br />- It's an easy install,<br />- A simple concept, simple execution, decent quality parts leads me to believe it'll last and stand up to some abuse.<br />- Definitely quieter, a quick measurement using a phone app puts it at 40% quieter under load, 53% at idle.<br />- Quad runs fine with it, must not change the back pressure much.<br /><br />- It does take up some space at the back of the quad, it would be the first thing hit in any accident involving the rear, there is a guard but it's not exactly bush bumper material.  Most annoyingly it interferes with opening the storage box at the back (Honda Fourtrax 350)<br />- It can get pretty warm so careful about touching it.<br /><br />Overall a great addon, should be available from the factory.
B008BTLI76|4|Worked, as expected it to. Great deal on a battery for the motorcycle. Thank you.
B00481F7XW|1|Ordered metric, was sent standard, tried to return and what a hassle to do this, cheaper to just buy another set elsewhere!
B008JORKP2|5|We've enjoyed this fire pit every time we've had friends over on our deck.  Unlike the large tall patio heaters, this unit is very aesthetically pleasing and relaxing while giving off plenty of heat.  Yes, it does burn through a 20# fuel tank in two to three long evenings, but it does it's job well, works instantly, and is very easy to use, letting you enjoy your company to the fullest!  Highly recommended!
B001QT9KO6|3|I put this product in my truck on two different occasions.  I was really hoping it would work but it hasn't.  I just have a very small coolant leak too.
B0024NSJWW|5|Made a big difference at night. Easy to change. Would buy again.
B008SEBQ2G|3|Shipping was very quick!!!<br />BUT my antenna was chipped on the bottom, the black layer was off on some spots with only the metal part showing, very disappointed!!!!<br />Reception is good on the popular stations, if you're into other radio stations beware for weak reception.
B00M8KHQW0|5|Received exactly as pictured. Daughter loves them. If you need a lanyard and want something different, this is a great choice.
B004TRKBOK|1|Low quality. Can't cut a seatbelt and I doubt it would break tempered glass.
B00ELJ5HHM|4|quality product .clear instructions . professional packaging
B005GXTSJA|5|I bought the 6000k for my girlfriend's 07 civic. Install isn't very hard at all if you have a little bit of common sense(hardest part was finding a spot for the ballast in the confined space). Lights look great and are super bright, no flickering at all so far! Great lights especially for the price
B00CMR79H6|4|Not bad but it's made for the 2012 and up jeeps. The older models don't have the tie down hooks that this mat has holes for but still looks nice.
B009HNX1H0|3|These mufflers tips were easy to install but don't do what I did and install them without putting some kind of protection on them.<br />Mine are starting to rust. I should of put some type of coating on them to protect them from the weather. They looked very cool<br />when I first put them on. I am going to order some new ones in the spring and put some type of water repellent on them so they will<br />last longer. Worth the price. But some today!
B0081ZZV6E|5|Just right
B004GYKO9S|3|They're doing their job so far but the rubber bands have started to crack and dry rot in just a month's time.  I live in the snowy mountains and only drive on snow packed dirt roads all winter.  So I keep the cable chains on the car for the winter driving 25mph or less.  Maybe these aren't supposed to be on that long?  I'm a bit disappointed but not sure what I should have expected for $9?  Not sure how long they'll last at this point.
B0013CP8SI|5|awesome easy to install very bright i will be using you guys for all my light upgrades and i will put in a good word for this company
B00CG5RYEW|1|It was junk didn't even work even took to a pro still had to order from someone else it worked great rating of half a star only because got here quick
B0007M308A|5|well made and does what is suppose to
B00BQO2QTC|1|Aluminum 10mm Mirror Clamp on Mount Adapter sold by TMS, Avoid these, poorly made and badly threaded for post mount use, weak aluminum threading with thin walls.
B004TCYONO|5|This is an original ac delco filter that I found and bought for a fraction of the cost of the local auto parts stores.
B000VLXA7S|5|Bought these ratcheting tie down straps to secure two 150 CC Vespa Scooters into the back of my pickup bed and they are great! The sewn loop at one end worked perfect around the handlebar and did not move at all. I have several ratcheting straps in my truck that I use all the time that do not have the loop and these are as good quality as they are, they are not cheap little straps.
B00KLEXOHQ|5|Awesome product, prompt delivery
B00MA4OFUU|4|If it wasn't for the ugly AMG logo it would be perfect. The logo etching it's somehow ugly, it doesn't look like OEM. For the parking brake pedal, I had to trim one side of the original pedal (yes, cut it off), so the screws of this pedals would fit. It's tricky but it'll do the job.
B002KC0QZK|1|chains are  too small  i could not find any sizes when ordering  just pictures of the chains on atv  I assumed that they fit the tires in the picture so they would fit my atv
B00915G02C|5|a must have
B004AIDBZO|5|Perfect part & extremely fast delivery.
B00332GM18|5|Great product, did what I wanted it to do, raise up tonno cover so tail gate didn't hit it when closing.  Least expensive of the ones I found that fit at 20% cheaper then the rest.  And made in USA!!!
B008PFA9XK|5|The paint matched perfectly and they were easy to install.No one will ever know they're aftermarket. The product exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0018KXFHQ|5|Real nice. Quality and durable material. I have 2 in my Z to keep the beats bumpin as I'm cruising down the beach
B000HAUXLE|1|Shrader valve leaked, nozzle opening to small.
B004IYZMUW|5|Works well no problems
B00JBIZWIC|5|Exact fit....had these for 14 years in my old Tundra and the carpets looked like new, even after 14 winters,  with free shipping and two day Prime, I had them in twp days. Now our new Tundra will stay looking new.
B00AMPJ68U|3|Three star rating is due to the fact that I ordered GATE Lifts when I needed WINDOW Lifts. Product looked well made.
B00LOZ7QVQ|5|DAUGHTER LOVED IT
B003Z9T33I|4|I ordered the 42-305 for a 2013 F-150 with bed-liner. The clamps that came with the cover did not sit correctly because the clamps were set at a spot that had no metal to clamp to (see pic). With the truck parked, I had the clamps secured as tight as possible, with the flap seal (the part of the bed-cover closest to the cab) curved in, and water still entered the bed. I like the idea and functionality of the tri-fold design, but it just did not keep my bed dry.
B00J3DB716|5|Was perfect , worth the wait.
B006WPQNB2|5|This toilet is pricey, but worth every penny.  I bought it at a local outfitter store.  It was normally priced at $119 at the time, but they made a mistake on the sign, and luckily for me they honored the advertised price.  Even if I'd had to pay full price, it would have been well worth it.  We've used other camp toilets before, all the way up to the regular Thetford 5 gallon model.  None compare to this.  It's far more comfortable to sit on, easy to flush (they have a manual flush version and the battery operated flush model, we like the battery operated one, you push the button for water to flow in, then there is a manual handle for the actual flushing), and much easier to dump.  There is very little splash back when dumping, and it's easier to control the flow.  HUGELY important, unless you don't mind dealing with...yuck.  We'd never go back to the cheaper Thetford model, or any other for that matter.  I balked at the price at first, but if I'm going camping, I want a good toilet with me.  It is bulkier and heavier, but again, totally worth it.
B00CXYVKKA|5|I received this before the estimated arrival date. It was easy to apply and looks awesome! In fact it inspired me to name my car Sue after Sue the T-Rex in Chicago! The amount of laughs this brought was well worth the price! Thanks for the quality product!
B004O5B6XM|5|Nice-looking, seems nice, haven't used it yet.
B004GE4H6E|4|This replacement part fit, however it was a little loose so I glued it in with a little JB Weld just in case.  Price was much much better than dealer.
B00D8BFJP4|5|Shows exactly how I feel
B007TYRDF0|5|Fit as described, o.e.m. replacement arrived on time
B0000AZ7ZP|5|worked with no issue , well made and looks great.
B0049EJM0C|5|This is my second regulator replacement so it went very quick and easy. This one works great! I'd buy another one.
B002R1MTUO|5|Was looking for a good replacement for our van and found this one. Came in quickly after order, was easy to install and is performing as expected.
B001OML246|4|I like it - it was what I expected from the description and like new although used and very reasonable price..
B000H6P55W|5|We bought this product so that sleeping bags, mats, etc, for camping can be placed on top of our truck. It takes sometime to put in and adjust, but that was most likely because this is the first time we are using it. Once in place, you just stuff your camping gear in. Towards the end of our camping trip, it rained. When we got home, all the gear inside were dry. Looking forward to using this again 8n our next camping trip.
B000COBVFM|4|KYB makes great OEM replacements for Nissan and Infiniti automobiles. These shocks are nearly identical to original equipment although I do believe that KYB makes them about 15% stiffer to compensate for other worn suspension components.<br /><br />Installation is straight forward for weekend mechanics. Removing strut springs requires a strut spring compressor, so make sure you have the proper tools (I rent the tool from my local autoparts store for free- deposit up front, 100% refund on return).<br /><br />The original version of these KYB struts were called GR2 and were silver like the photo in the product page. The newer version, Excel-G, is black. If you were hoping to get the silver version, you're out of luck. Yeah, I thought it looked better silver, too.
B00480GYSA|5|By my observation in a dark garage, I had one Philips H-11 and one Sylvania Silverlight H-11 in my low beams.  The Phillips was much brighter.
B003EOVMRO|4|Difficult install?  I honestly can't figure out what everyone is crying about.  I managed to install these side steps BY MYSELF in about an hour, with hand tools, and they look awesome!  Paper instructions are for sissies and guys named &#34;Teddy&#34;, do a YouTube search for Smittybilt SRC and you'll find everything you need. Will the paint peel off in a month?  Will they start rusting out in just a few weeks?  Only time will tell, but they are certainly heavy and solid enough.  The key to installing them on your own is jack stands. Jack stands... It's not rocket surgery.  Seriously?! &#34;Teddy&#34;?!  How do you sleep at night?
B003UT6LCO|5|Works just as advertised! Super nice not to have to worry about the drain plug while changing oil
B000C9UKHC|4|It fit perfectly and was all I expected it to be.  Delivery was quick and I trust the Wix brand.
B00WES8PLC|5|Worked great when I needed them.  Excellent quality and highly recommended.
B000CIV6E4|5|Sound's as good as 6 cylinder can sound.I didn't install it but the person that did said fit well.looks good.
B00BM9JGLW|5|They work, they match and the cost nearly nothing.  If you replaced the worn armrests you will pay hundreds of dollars, however these armrests do the trick.
B009G41GNQ|5|worked great!!!!!!
B001OIRUKK|5|Great quality, fit Great in our 2013 Wrangler 4 door. Love them! Quick delivery
B000AMXT4W|5|It works for what I want.  I park next to a cinder block wall.  I just need a little insurance if I open the door too wide.<br />I mean for the cost what more could you want.
B004SQM5NM|5|This item was very easy to install no problems at all a wrench is all you need. I looked up a simple video on youtube and I was done before i knew it!!
B000C1OWXS|5|it is beater than ac delco pads it is no noise and  Smooth Braking i well bay it next time
B001RJOP5Y|5|I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.<br />He say's it is one he would have bought himself, so I must<br />have done good.  Yes, he would recommend<br />this to anyone.  (in fact HE would like to get another one)
B009VXEXW8|1|Highly disappointed. It looks cheaply made. In fact it broke the second day I got it. Lame.
B004XEKJUK|5|i like it
B006X8B4GW|3|A word of caution: Like buying any type of additional body parts, some fitment is required. The craftsmanship and quality of this item is subpar at best. The grills aren't quite straight and some of the ends were bent. Nothing I couldn't tweak back to acceptable ranges and I don't believe this was due to shipping as the box was well packed and had no apparent damage. I will say it looks very cool once you tweak it to where it will fit right.<br /><br />Another thing that leads to this products cheapness are that the instructions are written in broken English and they aren't clear at all, which I found amusing.<br /><br />As the instructions are terrible, here's something to know that isn't pointed out in the product description very well.<br /><br />1) The upper grille piece is a complete replacement for your stock grille. Meaning - Take out your stock top grille and install this one.<br /><br />2) The bottom grille attaches to your existing stock grille. I found this odd and will look for a way to attach it without the bottom stock grille.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for a direct, easy, bolt on, aftermarket grille for your Tiburon, look somewhere else! Unless you're willing to do some work to make it fit right. I'm the type to tinker with things, so I didn't mind having to do some fitment and even expected it a little.<br /><br />Good luck all!
B002KLPECQ|5|Great sound for a 3&#34; exhaust.
B00CXYVKKA|5|I purchased this for my daughter and grandson who is obsessed with dinosaurs.  It is different than the other stickers, funny without being offensive.
B004H266X2|1|Ordered twice and neither was really precut and wouldn't fit my car.
B005N6YNPE|1|Material felt horrible on skulls
B00B0QBY94|4|This is so cute!  It's a little bigger than the original plug so my stray barely closes.  But it's so cute I'll deal with it!
B007TG7HV8|5|Great product
B004GLIMD6|5|The key fob arrived inside the estimated time,  I looked up the programming sequence on line and it worked the first try.
B002G3USIS|5|Very good product
B00VE1C3OK|1|Leather latch broke off after 3 weeks of use.  Enough said.
B000WHACHC|5|Did exactly as I thought
B000HBNU9K|5|This is very good glue to keep my carpets from moving in the garage mainly. It has a lot of uses which I take advantage of.
B005Q0Z18A|1|This is a super lame sticker.  Home made on someone's printer, probably 20 on a sheet of contact paper and then cut to size with a paper cutter.  I realize what it says in the ad about the size but check out that pic of the back window of the jeep in the advertisement for this product; that sticker is way bigger than what was shipped to me.
B0016IACI0|4|The hitch itself is excellent, there are many videos on YouTube that give step by step instructions for installation.  Once installed, The hitch is extremely stable and looks great. It's truly is hidden. The only thing on the bottom of my 2009 Toyota Camry is The hitch mount. Other brands do not have this minimalist Feature.<br /><br />The tongue weight for this hitch is a solid 350 pounds. Tongue weight is the force that is exerted downward on the hitch and is particularly relevant when installing something like a bike or cargo rack. This Hitch is superior for bike racks and cargo racks vs other brands because there are two supporting bars that go underneath your car and bolt into the spare tire well of the 2009 Toyota Camry. Many hitches do not have this feature, which results in a lower tongue weight, And in my opinion, less stability.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, The shipping packaging is quite poor. There will be no box when this hitch arrives. It arrives as the solid piece of steel. The accompanying bag of bolts should be taped on. Unfortunately, Amazon does a substandard job of attaching the bolt packaging to the metal hitch before shipping. I could see the location where the bag of bolts was taped on to the hitch Before being in advertently ripped off during the shipping process. It is clear that Amazon did not adequately tape the bolts to the hitch. I would highly caution you To be aware of this fact when ordering.<br /><br />Amazon gave me a $30 credit because the bolts were missing. This, sadly, was the better of the mindless alternative option given by Amazon: to return the entire rack so that it could be resent with the bolts. Yes, you read that right. Return a 45 pound steel hitch so that Amazon could tape on a quarter pound bag of bolts and reship it. I am not the most environmentally conscience person, but that option is rediculous. The customer service representative explained shipping me the bolts separately would be impossible. I took the credit and bought all the bolts at Lowes.<br /><br />Since you will likely receive the hitch without the bolts, here are some tips when you buy them at the hardware store. All bolts are not created equal. You must purchase at least property class 8.8 (10.9 is even better) for the 4 hex bolts used near the bumper. A lower property class has inferior steel which may be unsafe. The two bolts that drive into the tire well must be grade 5 or higher. Look at the spec sheet carefully and get the exact bolt size and steel strength.<br /><br />Install is much easier with 2 people, but I did it myself using the tire jack that comes with the Camry. Hoist one end up with the jack and bolt it, then jack the other side up and bolt it.<br /><br />The product is 5/5, Amazon is 0/5 for their poor packaging and disregard for the repeated posts about item not showing up with bolts.the credit and bought all the bolts at Lowes.<br /><br />Since you will likely receive the hitch without the bolts, here are some tips when you buy them at the hardware store.

B00A9MZAJA|5|Good product. It took me 2 hours and alot of patience to swap the actuator. Also it doesn't fit perfectly, you need to cut some plastic to assemble it.
B004131NEY|5|Saved a lot of money doing it myself.  Take your time taking apart the mechanism take pics with your camera as you go. Took a chance when ordering because the seller is not always clear if it will fit the vehicle seems there is a Honda part number and this manufacturers number.  I used this on a 2006 crv right rear door.
B00B92QI8Q|5|Exactly what I needed since I have an edge and an explorer;)
B000BZ93IY|4|The SET49 bearing set was just the ticket to replace the growling and howling wheel bearings in my wife's 2007 PT Cruiser.  PT Cruisers have a reputation of going through bearings relatively quickly; the car is derived from the Neon and uses many of the driveline and suspension components yet weighs an easy 1000-1500lbs more than the Neon. The bearings lead a heavily loaded life in a front-drive car.  Chrysler bean-counting engineering strikes again and the bearings were not upgraded/upsized to deal with the additional weight.  So they wear out in 50-60K miles instead of the 100-150K one expects a modern set of wheel bearings to last.<br /><br />The bearings were of high quality for the pricepoint and pressed in without problems; they're accurately machined.  It's been about 500 miles and there are no problems yet and the front remains quiet.  I expect these bearings to last at least the 65,000 miles that the original bearings lasted.
B002GZ20VE|5|Great iyems
B00EP6XASO|5|Good
B000IYISUM|3|working out ok
B004FZCILA|5|Works great
B00D31DZ28|4|Good product and light is good in both power and color.<br />I only dislike the way you install them they could have invested in a better base to be an exact fit
B00068KU1K|1|propaganda. it doesn't clean headlamps.
B000GKD5NI|4|I've been looking for a shade for my back rear window for awhile but always came across too short or needed to get two shades but it didn't fit.This is the longest I've seen and wor ks great! The suction cups stay and tge shade is long enought to cover almost the whole rear window that can keep the glare out of my child's eyes.
B00P99KKAM|5|Excited about my steering wheel cover.The red and black give a nice contrasting color to the beige, light tan, mocha colors of the car interior-- outside color of car is red. I enjoy the cushion grip feel which makes driving a pleasure.
B007TY232S|5|Better than the original.
B00881EQ1C|5|Great idea, however it did not fit my X3 rear plate area due to the reverse camera.
B009478LLK|5|They rocked - they were for my manager for Boss' day.  He loved them and thought it was a really thoughtful gift.  i would order from that company again in a heartbeat!  thanks
B00BHH1QT4|5|Shipping was on time. Great product!
B0002Z9QO4|5|The bag was a reasonable price and allowed 5 people to travel in a car very comfortably. A roof rack was not needed.
B0060ZB43G|3|They have a good tone together and are loud in the garage. But I can barely hear them inside my car on the interstate, let alone someone else on the road not paying attention. My oem horns are louder.
B00RHBMUK8|5|My car looks so much better.  I am very happy with the results.
B000VJ104U|2|i used to use a product called GS27 that worked great and google searches for that lead me to this. Its no were near as good and i'm dissapointed in it
B00651CLCS|5|Adds a low profile look to my jeep and hgets rid of the awkward metal stock antenna. Recommend.
B003VAV1P4|5|No problem, exact replacement.
B000KL5DIS|5|WeatherTech Custom Fit Rear FloorLiner - this is an excellent product, and made with pride in America too.  If you purchase it your car carpeting will be protected
B00D3YEGO6|5|I was afraid it might look tacky but since it has great reviews, I gave it a shot, and I LOVE IT!! Looks beautiful on my new car and it's nice and sturdy.
B00666M55A|5|i like it
B001PWA0IO|5|Fantastic product that should be standard on all trucks! Strut installed in less than 10 minutes. Installed on a 2014 Ford F150 Platinum.
B000X25MJE|5|Fits perfectly
B0050FU25I|3|Had to return piston, as it was wrong size.  Seleer was good to work with.  Waiting for credit/refund.
B00EC0ZHPW|1|I thought it would fit all RAM 1500. Double check the backing plate before ordering,it didn't line up with mine so I can not use it.<br />Other than that I can't complain about shipping and the quality. Returning and getting my money back is also easy.
B00KXNRF6Q|2|The lights are useless, it only looks like a projector light but is far from it. You can't see any thing on the road with it .<br />It is only a fake. Quality is horrible. Suggest anyone not to go for it.
B005HFYE1O|5|My husband purchased this and he does not complete reviews.  He was very pleased.  He is picky too.  So, I think you will be pleased if this is what you are looking for.
B009DJK4LE|5|No complaints
B000BZ968Q|5|Perfect fit.  Came with lugs.  Easy install.  Time will tell if it will last.
B00ANZHG4U|5|These cloths are a great size and I am using them for many different tasks.
B00RXZRZGM|5|easy fix
B0002STR90|5|These are very handy to have around - I use them to clean my chucks on my wood lathe - lathe bed etc....works great
B005QD1PTQ|2|Product works fine but the dice are pretty bulky and look funny.  not using them presently.
B001O7PNW8|5|It's my go to polish for all my paint corrections. If you pair it with M205 you have a winner. Although I prefer Mezerna 85rd
B000BQR100|5|The shades lower the temperature in my car. They are not difficult to be folded. Just practice a few times.
B009A2SYGQ|1|These lights were terrible 1 out of 4 lights worked! I was also told these would fit my car but they do no fit for my reverse lights however they did fit in my brake light but again 1 out of 4 worked. Junk.... Do not buy these lights
B002R4U7G4|4|Ends become unraveled and had to waste about a foot
B005HZ4HBG|4|These mats fit our 2012 Acadia (w/ bucket seats) great. The color matches the car's interior well and they look great once installed. The only thing I don't like about the mats is that there is no way to cover the tracks in the floor for the bucket seats, so crumbs, dirt, etc. can still accumulate in there. Not a big deal, but it would be nice if there was a better way to cover these somehow.<br /><br />Overall, these are great mats and we are satisfied with them.
B0050DD3XS|2|I have a 2009 HD Street Glide with long whip antenna.  I first hid my long whip antenna against the frame by rotating the antenna mount 90 degrees down the left side of the frame.  I immediately noticed a huge drop in reception for both AM and FM stations.  I purchased this product and installed it inside my batwing fairing as directed by manufacturer.  I noticed a slight increase in reception but NOTHING like the original long whip antenna.  I read numerous reviews on this product and I was led to believe it was as good as the original antenna.  Unfortunately, IT IS NOT!
B000FQ285E|5|This saved the day, wasn't confident they would fit, but they do work fine; although they are slightly off from the OEM size.
B000KEUFME|5|While the device comes with very little in the way of instructions, if you're purchasing this you probably know what you're doing or how to find out. I did not want to spend a large amount of money on a tester and I took a gamble on this much cheaper alternative. It does what it advertises and seems to work great. I have had no problems with my radio.
B00OPMIR2M|5|Works like a charm. Love the light. Much better than the run of the mill pressure gauges. Watch the few extra dollars.
B005FKUZL4|5|Great price and great quality. Love these. Installed on the front of a 2000 Ford Expedition and they work great. Can't beat the price.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Just ordered another one for my husband car
B00CKFWKWY|5|First off, this is the best scan tool you can buy for the money. It does ABS, SRS, transmission, transfer case, and engine codes. It also gives you CODE CONNECT which helps you determine which defective part to replace. There is NO charge for updating the scan tool. You just down load the program to your laptop or computer, plug in the scan tool to your computer (with the provided cable), and you can update, save scan tool data, or print out the data from the scan tool.<br />This scan is very high tech, the only thing this scan tool can't do is make changes to your ECU factory settings.<br />I bought this scan tool after doing about 2 weeks worth of research. It does cost a little more than other brands, but you get what you pay for. I specifically needed this scan tool because my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry SE V-6  threw a ABS light. With this scan tool I was able to read the code then CODE CONNECT told me to replace RF wheel speed sensor. After I replaced the speed sensor, I erased the code, and the Camry is back working like it should.<br />I also bought this scan tool because it works with my 2 other vehicles: 2005 Nissan Frontier Nismo 4.0L V-6, and my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR 1.8L<br />Included: scan tool, a very well made zippered case, install CD, manual, and USB cable<br />I do recommend this product!<br />CPS
B00OCEGONC|5|I've used it a few times and really like it. I've used with hot oil and the hose didn't melt or collapse. I pulled a quart of hot oil in under 2 mins.  it's not super tough (hard plastic) so you have to be careful / smart but it'll definitely last. I'm very happy with my purchase and so are my cars.
B0050EITTK|2|I'm in the Texas Hill country and was using this unit on hard well water.  According to the strips, it couldn't get my water to the &#34;soft&#34; range.  It also leaked and the valves and was forced to return it :(  We have since moved the 5th wheel to a park with much softer water.
B0002NILKG|5|Love it!!!!! Fits nicely in my truck.
B000LNTN2C|5|I installed this under my kitchen sink on the door to hold dish-washing liquid, sponge and other dish-washing kitchen items.<br /><br />Installation was quick & easy with 2 screws.  It works great & I don't have to bend over to grab those items that I need to wash dishes.
B00340A6QG|1|pliers were not useable for the task
B00W1WHLF2|5|this adapters are real good<br />fit in my car perfect thank you
B001AM8KAO|5|You probably will NOT need any extra tubing with this shock kit. They send plenty. Shocks were easy to install and work great for boosting my towing capacity just enough without being too stiff. Good product at and very reasonable price.
B005O2869G|4|Product is really nice and everything worked out really well. One small glitch was delivery since the package is larger than your typical shipment. Had to talk to the driver to coordinate the delivery. Also tracking information or more specifically the company name would have been helpful.
B000E7FO9G|4|If it was $5-10 cheaper, this would be a five star review. I was able to slip it on over my intake in about 90 seconds. I saw other reviews that said it was a &#34;bear&#34; to get on, but I didn't experience that at all. It's snug, but not difficult.<br />I have noticed zero change in performance since I installed it, and the peace of mind I have knowing that there's an additional layer of protection against hydro-locking is well worth it.
B00FSEF7WY|4|Look ok, unfortunately did not fit my new EBR, will sell on, unused.
B002SRZQV6|1|After reading the reviews I thought this may help in removing sanding scratches in clear coat. Even on perfectly smooth<br />clear coat it wouldn't remove 3000 grit scratches using a black wool pad- the scratches just laughed at this stuff. It may very well work for other problems but for sanding scratches forgetaboutit.
B001EW86GS|5|Works great!. Makes my motorcycle shine and wipes off easily. LOVE this stuff!
B001EYDT18|4|Easy to install and works fine.
B004I12MXU|5|Matches as perfect as the original for the second time after your wife backs the truck into the garage.  Fit and finish is the same as the OEM.
B001GJ3FIS|4|works very well
B001U5TO60|5|Great looking & clean cut! Does it's purpose. Makes it easier to wipe up messes & clean weekly. My mom loves it in her car!
B000BUQODG|5|great deal works great Thanks!
B00480FIMI|5|Recently upgraded the bulbs in my car with these and WOW, what a difference. Noticeably brighter and slightly whiter than stock bulbs. Unlike most aftermarket bulbs, these don't put out a cheap blue hue but give a nice factory-look. These are also supposedly some of the most reliable and long-lasting bulbs of this type/price. Definitely recommend.      The only problem I had was opening the plastic packaging in which they came. Whoever designed it definitely wanted to piss people off.
B008G510QO|4|I got these because I wanted something in case I lost my ATV [s]  keys on the ground or on the trail.  Hopefully they would be easier to find !  Look like they will do the job.
B000EVWDAK|1|Doesn't work on my 2015 nissan sentra and my 2006 corolla
B004GDY9Y0|5|Worked great
B00KLZ65GM|5|Love it having lots of fun with it
B006524HCO|3|I like the seat. It works, but the passenger has a tendency to slide off the back. May be better if repositined but passenger needs to be able to reach the foot pegs and can only do it in the position I had it in.
B000A8JNF0|5|I applied 303 with a paint brush,let it dry over night and waited for the rain.I did this about a month ago,and every time it rains,the top beads up like it's been waxed!
B00362HVM4|4|They are great but it took awhile to get to me.If it would have took one more day i would have called in
B00K7X92BI|3|Looks great but it's way too big for my steering wheel.  My wheel is 13.5&#34;.  The cover is supposed to work with 13.5 to 14.5 wheels.  Not even close
B00HO6BFYS|5|As described, easy to install, good fit & look good....
B003L35EWM|5|Way better than other interior cleaner and smells great. Also, not slimy like others.
B0002LAC6E|5|This thing works extremely well, much better than the bug and tar sprays I've tried. Just make sure you have very soapy water and get scrubbing. Those bugs and tar will disappear before your eyes and you'll wonder why you didn't have one of these sooner! To make it last longer - I cut it into 3 pieces with a serrated bread knife when I received it, based on a recommendation I read somewhere.
B002JATYOC|4|Good product
B009P20LTO|5|Needed an additional remote key and once our dealer programmed this one, it worked as well as the original.  Very pleased and would recommend to others willingly.
B008BX0AUI|5|Wow, are those lights bright and they are pure white. It took me about a minute to replace each side. Im very glad I have purchased them, excellent product and fast ship. Thanks!
B000EQAH9Y|5|Fits excellent and works perfect.... with this price and no core charge this was a great deal.... Will buy again from the seller if I need another one.
B000FIWKQY|1|At least in New Mexico, these and other sound repellers do not work. Neither does granular deterrent. Traps work IF you find someone who sets them properly.
B005IGTEQ2|4|bright shiny adequate
B001AY2WLU|4|Cool little tool. I leave my keys on my desk at work and people end up playing with it.  The side tool came a little loose and I needed to use a pair of pliers to press them back together so they were tight again.
B001CEG90I|2|Did not fit my vehicle.
B00IS93VKG|5|2010 jk, install was a breeze, very durable, solid bumper/tire carrier. stock bumper weighs approx.12lbs. New bumper and tire carrier is 160lbs so it adds quite a bit more weight to the vehicle. But for the product itself im very pleased, especially for the price.
B00230J358|5|It installed fairly easy. Be careful to order the right one for the application.The plow mounts to it securely but the holding pins are a pain to get in if not lined up right. And not a bad price too.
B004ZMC8X6|1|This item is totally worthless as a freezer or refrigerator. It works intermittently on either AC or DC. Never use it on any item that may be harmed by warming to temperatures of 50 F as that happens frequently. We have had the same experience with two brand new units. Norcold sent a new replacement for the first one we purchased. Both experienced the same problems. We have been dealing with an authorized service center on & off for two years who has not been able to fix either item.
B00B5LMA3I|5|The price on these are great and they look amazing. Quality appears to be top notch.install is very simple although I recommend removing the seats to make it even easier. Really changes the interior of the car for the best.
B006PAGJXQ|1|I JUST BOUGHT THIS CRAP OF PRODUCT ON 02/06/2012 AND IT'S NOT WORKING AS OF LAST MONTH... I AM SO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT COST ALOT OF MONEY AND IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY....

B00A712W94|5|Like it alot
B00APN8YTG|4|Great product, Thank you
B000I04Z7Q|5|These lights are so nice!! I tried running them from the fuse box but for some reason it wasn't working for me. Instead I ran them straight to the battery. The colors are really vibrant and there's a lot of color selection and patterns. The sound mode does work in my opinion. The control box is on the left side by my steering wheel and the colors change to the beat of the music.<br /><br />Installation- it was a pain but well worth it. After resolving the fuse box issue it was time to set up the led lights. I put two under the dashboard and two under the front seats to give the back row a glow. The lights come with screws and a 3M double sided tape for the control box. I didn't really want to use screws but in the end I had to go ahead and screw in the two dashboard lights. The holes are really small and barely visible. It's also sturdier than just using tape. The ones under the front seats were the toughest ones. No room to drill and double sided tape wouldn't stick. I had to get myself a roll of Velcro since my front seats have a carpet like material that Velcro sticks to. I cut out a lot of strips to insure that they were sturdy. I was also able to run the wires discretely and they are not even visible. The cables did hang down from the control box, getting in the way of the pedals so I also wrapped them with Velcro attaching them to some of the wires under the dashboard and now it's safe to drive!! :)
B0002MA68M|5|I installed them on the back of my utility bed. They work well and are of a very good quality.
B0002MBT4W|3|The mats themselves are probably OK, but regardless of what AMAZON says, they don't fit a Jeep Cherokee. They are for a Dodge Nitro and Jeep Liberty.
B00ABYDOXU|5|This worked like the original, made in China but still working well. Shipped quickly and arrived undamaged, well boxed etc.
B00EXIEVO6|5|handy little gadget for us shade tree mechanics.....
B001SW81NC|5|looks lovely ,<br />thank you
B008QR1ASK|5|Great value for the money.  I use these towels for gun cleaning a few times then toss them out, as they get loaded with non-toxic but very oily solvent.  I find them superior to paper towels for cleaning metal, as they shed less, and can be re-used a few times.
B00IP68IEQ|4|Great looking lights, corner lights didn't fit well but nice anyway
B000E4TWRY|5|Quick shipping and easy installation.
B001C92Y84|1|Installed these and they failed within a year.  The Bendix ceramic CT-3 pads i installed were great but the rotors cracked internally at the vent vanes.  These rotors are structurally unsound - they caused major steering wheel vibration.  Plus they are expensive and they rust very quickly.  Rotors looked  10 years old after one year.  The forces on these rotors slots with the ceramic pads leads to fatigue cracking.  Either use soft pads which wont last or do not buy these rotors.  These rotors are so weak at the vanes i believe impact wrenches can break them,<br />FWIW I am a mechanical engineer.
B004SR7JVO|5|worked perfect
B005VSISJG|4|When I first got it the the color was great.  Over time, its gone from the bright gold it once was to a much darker color.  Still like it though.
B008R0NQLK|5|Love it!
B00032KC2G|4|They work as intended but they are larger then they need to be for my  2000 VW<br />The Locking fasteners are no joke, they lock on tight!
B00II9VHF2|5|Very good quality decals
B00J51J14Q|5|Phenomenal product.  I used this on a 1997 Infiniti i30t and the match was perfect.  Make sure you follow the video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr37LFZZTGU<br /><br />And you'll be good to go.  Ordering more from ScratchWizard for other vehicles.<br />Lots of choices out there for work like this.  My car was a BIG job, and ScratchWizard met all the requirements.
B0070Y36N2|2|Shipment arrived quickly, but the frame is lacking in quality...<br /><br />I guess I was just expexting it to be a little thicker and heavier for the amount spent.
B004JHBKLS|1|Fits like a glove. Remember O.J.? Had to trim and use a bit of duct tape to make it fit. 2005 Subaru Forrester
B000M8U6RM|5|Works great.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and is very flexiable in where you can use it.
B00BL7SZQC|5|Not knowing how it would fit or if the color would match my motorcycle due to buying on line I was very happy when it arrived even before I expected to and that the fit and color were perfect.
B006BCRNYM|5|Wow I am speechless right now, I received this item earlier then expected. Super fast delivery, it came with instructions. I just followed the easy three instructions and everything worked!!! This works perfect for my 2003 Four Door Infiniti G35!! I will continue to buy from this seller! The price does not do it justice!
B0041I0Y80|5|Great Product. Easy to install.  Fast delivery!
B00LMH8ZEI|5|Easy to install and working well.
B00E38RRU6|4|It doesn't fit good, i have a space in the front part of the cover, and cold wind comes from there.
B004AITV9Y|5|Works Great and the shop was impressed with the price.  Quickly installed.  The replacement stem is an added benefit since that  is the part that corrodes an needs replacements.<br /><br />Thanks!
B006N95R14|5|This is a great little product with lots of different uses. It's lightweight and easy it install, or you can simply set it somewhere and use it without mounting. The light strip is a thin, three foot flexible strip with a small battery pack that can be easily attached, mounted or hung. This is a great product that can be used in the garage, in a closet - anywhere that needs a little extra light without going to the trouble of installing a whole new light fixture.
B003NI1H5I|5|Gets the job done great investment
B00CHS6TGM|5|Lowers great for fixing broken tail lights 👍
B000KK6X1K|5|Price was great,and it fits just like the one it replaced. Who could ask for more? It showed up in no time too.
B001C6OYHQ|5|Perfect
B005KQUQY4|5|Even thought it was not listed, this fit my 2006 Vulcan 500. Perfectly. It's shape takes into account the factory turn signals unlike the previous one I had. I would recommend the N8803 model to anyone needing a good windshield that diverts most of the wind off you.<br /><br />Randy
B001L9ZBZS|5|As a person whom is pro-choice, I really like this sticker and it looks great on my vehicle. Great quality material, although it's a little smaller than I had hoped. Nonetheless, I really liked the shipping speed and low cost :)
B0075FU38W|5|The remote mechanism inside our keys still worked fine but the buttons were falling off making it very difficult to activate the remote.  When I found these keys on line for under $8 each (with shipping) I figured it was worth taking a chance on before going to the dealer and paying between $100 to $200 each.  I was right........Took the keys to Home Depot and they cut for free.  Popped in the remote from the old keys and they work like a charm.
B0024NSWEM|5|I couldnt tell the difference between these and the OEM headlights. I instslled them myself and they lined up perfectly with the exsisting mounting holes. We'll see how long they last!
B000PJED72|5|Much better than regular silicone because of the dry film it leaves on the surface. I use it on the chrome levelliing shafts of the automatic levelling system on my RV. With regular silicone I had to re-apply every 2nd or 3rd use or they started making noise. With the 3M Dry Lube I go much longer between applications.
B005212WTO|5|great
B00EPJFN72|5|Easy to install, look great, beam projection just like the halogen bulbs.
B004MBLV2O|5|ok
B003AS99DI|4|Bought this a month ago, it took me and my husband about 30 minutes to figure out how to put it on my car. But it really worth of the effort.
B00OJ98YOC|5|Purchased elsewhere, but wanted to leave a review and photo since there are so few detailed write-ups about this liner.  I opted for the OEM mat because it seemed to share many of the features of the more expensive Weathertech and Husky-brand mats... but at a  more attractive price. (My Explorer is a 2013, but I don't believe Ford has changed the back dimensions in any of their models since the big changeover in 2011.)  The mat arrived rolled up in a box; I was a bit skeptical at first because it was thinner than I was expecting and I didn't like that it appeared to be warped. No problem. After just a few hours in the back of the vehicle, it flattened down perfectly in place. The raised edges will contain any spills and the ridges help provide a bit of grip, though the surface is still a bit slick/not rubbery. I keep large milk crates in the back and I'll hear them scoot a bit if I take a fast corner. The whole thing conforms perfectly to the space... I was pleased to find that access to the tie-down points were not blocked. Cleaning is simple because the liner is so light: just pull it out, hose it off and you're good to go.  If you needed to, you could easily roll up the mat and stow it behind the third row if you needed the extra seats.  One thing to note: the back edge does not butt-up against the back of the second row seats. There is a gap of about an inch or so. This is because while the bench seat is fixed in place, the single seat (passenger side) can scoot forward and back. The gap allows that seat to move without bunching up the liner.
B000BRJQ9S|1|although the product may be good or even great it takes them a week just to send it out then with the shipping time I may die of old age before I ever get to see it
B002FHF4WA|3|this snow bib is too bulky and the zipper broke after a week or so and it is not really waterproof.
B003RVQIGY|5|Worked flawless, I saved over $45.00 dollars from the same Packaged item at O'rileys Auto Parts and Autozone. Follow the instructions in your owners manual for programming.
